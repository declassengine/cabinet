G. ROBERTS, H.P.,                          MINISTER  OF  LABOUR.  INTRODUCTORY.  In accordance with your request WG have visited France with a  View to reporting upon certain allegations of immoral corduct  which have recently gained currency as regards members of the  \7-AvA..G.,   We have spent eight days In the country and made -nu-ne  survey of the general conditions of the Corps.   ./e have vi-Ji$ed  29 camps and hostels both in the Northern and Southern Areas and  in the course of our enquiry have inter viewed not only the Chief  Controllers and Administrators of the Corps but have discussed  the srriatlon with 80 persons including she Adjutant General,  Ba^e Commandants and other responsible officers. Censors,-  Chaplains, medical men and women, and the officials of the  Y*k.C.iio and Y../-C.A.  An enquiry in a foreign country conducted during war time within  the -4oae of ihe armies must necessarily be more limioel in scope  and rebtrioted as regards wiuncos bhaa a civil enquiry mzide a5  home under normal conditionsa  The milltary authorLJte i agreed,  however, chat we should visit the localities and OJXIOO indicated  by ourselves and within the limits of the time allowed us our  enquiry did not conform to any prearranged programme.  During our tour we have stayed in both large and small camps of a  representative character and have been able to judge the general  conditions under which the women live and are housed.  ./e have  also seen the latter at their work in camps, oifices, stores,  etc., and at the various places of amusement provided for the  Corps.  As a result of our enquiry we can find no justification  of any kind for the vague accusations of immoral conduct on a  large scale whichrhave been circulated about the V.A.A.C.  The  chief difficulty of our task has lain in the very vague nature  of the damaging charges wecwere requested to investigate.  It  is common knowledge that fantastic talcs have passed from mouth  to mouth of the numbers of ./.A.A.C. women returned to England  for misconduct of the gravest character.  These stories are best  refuted by the folloTdng official returns which prove that not  only are the statements untrue but that up to the present tho  number of undesirable women who have found their way into the1./ Corps
     Corps has &quot;been vary small,     STATISTICS OF DISMISSALS. HUES. OFFICES, etc.4.   The strength of the V/.A.A.C. personnel in Franco up to Kerch 12th     1918 was stated to us as being 6023 women *  7e have examined the     medical records &quot;both in England and Franco and find that of this     number, 21 pregnancy cases had been reported since the arrival of     the Corps in France and 12 cases of venereal disease,   la regards     the first category, two were married women and it appears that the     bulk of the cases were pregnant before coming to France.  As regards     the second category, some cases were doubtful and others of old     standing.          In addition to the above 19 women have been returned to     England on disciplinary grounds and 20 for inefficiency,  59 women     have been discharged on medical grounds,  including the 12 oases     mentioned above, and 21 on compassionate  grounds, i.e. family     reasons.  From July 1st 1917 to March 11th 1918 (9 months)  the     following offences have been recorded:  Pines 17, Confined to     Camp 41, Restriction of Privileges 23,  Admonitions 7,  - total 88.          7e consider that these figures are in themselves  a refutation     of the current slanders which naturally have caused considerable     alarm and distress among the friends and  relations of  women     already enrolled and have exercised a very detrimental effect  on     recruiting.  We also wish to point out the pain and indignation     caused among members of the Corps returning homeon leave when     confronted by these allegations.     DIFFICULTIES OF EZPjJUIJjUT.5.   The employment of women for the first time in history  as an     organised corps of workers in close connection with the  Array has     been a new and in some respects a revolutionary experiment.   Such     an organisation involves the revaluation  of many long  standing     conventions and this fact in itself is apt to excite comment.   7o     feel that at 6very turn a situation so  novol calls for the  utmost     care and vigilance on the part of those who are responsible  for     the control and discipline of the Corps,   The wholly abnormal     conditions under which women are working  with the .;.rmy not  in  their     owr ooujbry but in a foreign land lend themselves to mis-     re pre sen Nations of a character which do not arise in civil     eniylo^xeut at home-,  Special watchfulness is therefore essential     on the part of the authorities as regards the personnel,of  the     Corps, aad the avoidance of even accidental situations which     innocent in themselves may givo rise to unfounded rumours.   \7e     desire to record our unanimous conviction that up to the present     every effort has apprcntly been made by the authorities  to  safe-     guard the position and that with some exceptions the conduct of the     ;/-A.A.C. in France has been upright and self respecting.  V.*e feel     that the largo majority of the girls who  have cone forward  in  an     hour of ctisis end difficulty to share  the  work of the men  in  the     field have upheld the honour of their sex and of their country in;     a spirit which should win for them the  regard aud gratitude of the     nation..     CALP3, HOSTELS :\M OCILCL HEALTH.6.   Our attention during the enquiry WuS naturally first directed  to     the conditions under which the girls are  living,          Luoh care and considoration have clearly been -riven by the     military authorities to the position and  establishment oi the                                      2,                 /various
 various camps  and hostels.   The  sanitary arrangements are good and hot and cold water is provided.  The comfort of the girls has been considered  in  every way compatible with a  state of active service and the conditions though very simple are  not in the wrong sense of tho word rough.     Tho recreation huts and rooms though  they naturally vary in details of  taste and arrangement are in the main bright and cheerful buildings.  We are g ad to find  that no attempt has been made to house the women under the same conditions  of cubic space as obtain for the mo&amp;.  We proved for  ourselves that there is no hardship in sleeping on Army beds in Army blankets.  We had also personal experience  of the abundance  and  excellent  quality of the Army rations. The food was uniformly good  and well cooked.  The open air life whatever its disadvantages in cold and muddy weather has apparently many compensations and our general impression of the physical conditions  of the girls was  one  of abounding good health.  This impression  was borne out by  the  official figures of sickness which are veaiy low, namely, 2.5. per cent in hospital.  &amp;ine women doctors are attached to the Corps and routine inspections of the women and the camps take place at frequent intervals.  We visited two hospitals and a convalescent home among those provided by the v7.A.A.C* and the arrangements were of a very satisfactory character, DISCIPLINE  AND Hgg 0? CQKPS. We were impressed in the course  of our enquiry by the good discipline and tone of tho Corps both as regards Administrators and the rank and file.  The  Administrators as a body havo faced a novel situation with pluck  and capaaity and  they deserve every credit for building up the morals and discipline of  tho Corps  with so large a measure of success.  The military note  in the daily life of tho womenTs camps is not strongly marked and so far as it exists is concerned primarily with the maintenance of docorum  and good mannors among the girls,  ^iany of the camps are necessarily situated in close proximity to those of the men and in such  localities the Administra- tors endeavour that with a view  to general wolfare and propriety the womon should as far as possible march in companies to and from their work.  Clearly it would be impossible to allow individual girls liberty to  cone and go at will in an area where soldiers, prisoners, and nativo  labourors arc all to bo.found although tho latter are undor supervision.  Wo are of opinion that the regulations in this respect, arc desirable in the interests of tho women thomsolvos.  Such drill and route marches as are enforced aro in tho nature of physical exercise and have a hygienic rather than a military valuo, V/OHK Of V/.A.A.C, Base Commandants and other officers with technical cxporioneo h&amp;vo spoken to UB in warm torms of the work of tho .7.A.A,C.   Thoy state that the girls have shown diligence at duty and good behaviour dur- ing leisure hours.  Gratitude was repoatodly expressed to us for the improvod standards of cleanliness, oomfort and economy which had resulted from tho introduction of womon as camp cooks.  t7e were told they had dealt in a novel and ingenious manner with tho Army rations and that tho food in consequence 7/as more varied and appetising- Tho appreciation shown by the soldiers for tho work of tho womon and thoir obvious  good will towards tho Corps mado a pleasant impression on tho Commission.  Wo were &apos;often told of  tho help and assistance given in the camps by soldiors of all ranks to individual Units whith had resulted in greater amonitios of lifa boing provided for the girls.  Ono and all. tho  officers wo interviewed oxpressod groat indignatiox at the chargos brought against tho Corps and tho injustioo of the indiscriminate  accusations under which a well*behavod, respectable and hard working sot  of girls were labouring.
V IThe same opinions were expressed by officials of the Y.W.&amp;.A.  andY.LW.A. who have special opportunities for coming: into touch  withthe girls during their free time.OI-JGII OF RUMOUKS..&apos;o do not find it easy to sum up in a few words the causes which haveled in all probability to the circulation of theso stories,  it isgenerally admitted that a state of war tends in itself to create asomewhat abnormal and excited mentality and that the general atmospherepi educed is cno peculiarly favourable to the growth of fictitioustales,  /ho figures already quoted show that some cases of misconductand unsatisfactory beha^jour have taken place among the V/.A.A.C andapart from actual misconduct among any large body of women a porccnt-ago must necessarily be found whose behaviour is less discreet andseemly than could be wished.  A small foundation in fact becomes thobasis on which a vast superstructure of slander is easily roared,especially in a foreign country.ie must draw attention tfa the fact that at the outset the advent ofthe Y/.A.2L.G. created undoubtedly considerable surprise and some dismayamong the serious minded French population.  French customs andtraditions of family decorum are far removed from the general socialideas which in theso latter times regulate the intercourse of youngmen and young women of British origin.  Comradeship between tho sexeswhich is a commonplace in the one oountry is unknown in tho ether.This freedom of social intercourse generally recognised in England isnot rendered more comprehensible to a race- with domestic customswholly different from our own by tho fact that tho men and womenconcerned are both wearing uniform.  The sploncid traditions of theFrench Army have not so far included tho services of a body of womonworkers definitely enrolled as on auxiliary branch.  It is very naturaltherefore, that a section of our Allies viewed with considerableperplexity a situation so different from any with which they arcpersonally familiar, and that at times the position was open to mis-construction in their eyes.     jo wore glad to understand that with the lapse of time the Frenchpoint of view about tho ./.A.A.C has been considerably modified andthat the work of British women in France is by degrees winning growingappreciation from thorn.  It is interesting to note th this connootionthat wo woro told of a distinguished French senator who had in*noc*3qdthe 7.A.A.C. in one area with a view to Vno possible establishment ofa French corps of womon organised on similar lines.  The Senator inquestion expressed himself in eulogistic terms as to tho work whichwas being carried on by tho i7.A.A.C and had under consideration theextension of the principle to^oVn&apos;countrywomen.It is further cloar from the evidonco wo received that theso rumourshavo also obtained currency at home owing to letters addressed bysoldiers cn active service to their relations in England^  In theopinion of witnesses qualified to ;judgc motives of varying characterhave probably influenced correspondence of this type.  Our attentionwas frequently drawn to the point that certain men dislodged fromnon combatant tasks in the bases by the substitution of women had insome cases  shown jealousy and hostility towards tho ./.A./...C.  lc wassuggested to us that many of the rumours may have sprung from thissource and wo woro impressed with the consensus of opinion on thispoint.  Other causes have probably influenced correspondence.  Insome cases men aro unwilling to oxposo thoir womonkind to the possibleperils of oxistonco in a foroign country especially in view of theprevalent anxieties as to tho moral atmosphere of the Bases;,  In ^others tho  element of sox jealousy in mere than one form arises- inothers again some  idle rumour which has parsed from mouth yo mouthand  lost nothing in tho telling is sot down in blackand white and                              4,                        /serves
servos to vary the possibly monotonous record of the weekly letterhome.  The rumour thus becomes a written statement and as suchacquires an authority in which any real basis of truth is oftenentirely lacking.  Similarly stories for which some foundation mayc:sist are repeated over and over again with various additions andexaggerations and tend to ^roup themselves into a few stock fableswhich in one form or another reappear at every Base in turn.  One specific rumour which in varying forms has had considerablecirculation in this country was concerned with a disturbance in acamp.  We have traced the rumour to its source and it was found notto. have tho smallest connection with tho W.A.A.C.  Charges which restOn foundations even more slendor than theso are difficult to disprovecwing to their indefinite character.  The host answer to them is tobe found in the general tone and temper of the Corps *SOCIAL ILLATIONS BgTggjjjg 7.A.A.C,S and SOLDIERS.m think that tho regulations of the Corps in this respect aro sensibleand broad minded.  As regards the general question of the relationsbetween tho soldiers and the V/.A.A.C.S wo are glad to record thoconstant tributes which reached us as to tho good influence of thowomon on tho mon.  Many officers, tho Chaplains and also thoofficials of the Y.7.C.A. and Y.U.CA. spoke with warm appreciation- - J -&apos;- - &quot;    -&quot;- w-j.  i--- ^ *-v------- - ------ - -  -   r- - - -  ----- a.-; ---- - -  - i.^  s.  - GOntl&quot;0to tho effect that scandalous tales in connection with the Y/.A.A.Chad emanated from some of tho low class ^estaminets&quot; (public  houses)whoso custom among British soldiers had suffered considerably owingto the bettor type of companio-nchl^pnow available for tho mon.  V.Towere struck generally speaking with the frank and self respectingbehaviour of the  womcm and men wo encountered casually together intho street or in places of amusomont.  The girls have boon taught  torespect their uniform and in tho main would appear to do eo.   Except-ions of course occur but tho general impression is wholesome  andsatisfactory.-Yomon are allowed a pass from their Administrator to  entertain or  beentertained by soldiers at recognised places of amusement provided bythe Y. i?.C.A,, Y,M*C,A., Church Army, etc.  On the occasion ofevening parties thoy go in a group and are accompanied by a forewoman.Thoy may similarly invite men to entertainments organised in  their owncamps and hostels.  French places of amusement, cafes,  restaurants,arc placed out of bounds except in the caso of a few recognised toashops.. Girls may not bo absent from any moal at their camp orhostel without a pass, every meal being in effect a roll call.  Finalroll call is held at 8*30 p.m. and every girl absent at that  hourmust bo:&apos;furnishod with a pass issued by hor Unit Acjministratcr, orfrom the office whore she has been detained,  The Administrator isthus kept in close touch with the movements of tho giils throughouttho day and a scrutiny of paasos is mado in doubtful cases.Members of tho ./.A.A.C. are also forbidden to associate with French^civilians.  Thanks to those measures tho possible danger which mighuencompass the work of a girl in the zone of the armies arc verylargely mitigated.  Wo aro of opinion that tho present position oftho Corps in franco compares very favourably with oDvious perils runby                                  -            &apos;larjmorality -.  ...                                       .who wishes to lead a steady life is we believe assured 01 everyopportunity  of doing so when serving with tho  Y.A.AvC.  in France,7e&quot;aro also  of opinion that girls who Join tho Corps wi.houo aserious motive and merely  in the hope of excitement and change wi-l                                 5.                /find
  find little- opporMi%for gratifying these desires under the strenuous.  conditions of life and work which -onerally obtain among&quot;the^-over seas  units,U The regulation which forbids social intercourse between officers and  members of the W.A.A.C. rank and file was criticised to us by some  persons as being unnecessarily stringent; a view in which we&quot;were at  first disposed to concur,  ue gave corsiderc-ble attention to this point  and feel after discussion filth men and women of proved experience that  the rule is for many reasons a desirable one and should be enforced.  y;EC0M!v31ID.-TlQKS.i. A.  It will be seen from all we have said above that not only do we feel  that the current stories about the misbehaviour of the W.A.AcC*  in  Prance are slanderous and untrue but that the nation is heing well and  faithfiilly served by the women of the Corps,  i/e desire, however, in  presenting this Report, to impress upon the authorities our conviction  that as the Corps grows in numbers the difficulties of its management  are bound to increase and that ceaseless vigilance will be more and more  obligatory as the administrative units spread.  The task of adjusting  under the abnormal conditions of warfare both the work and the ri^ht  social relations of large numbers of uniformed young women with soldiers  not only working in the&quot;Bases but passing to and from the more electric  atmosphere of the line is no light duty.  It is in our opinion essential  if good tone and good morale are to be preserved that the utmo s t G si&apos; e  should be exercised in the selection of the ./.A.A.G* personnel drafted  to France and we recommend that all pressure to effect substitution on  a large scale should be resisted if the available material is not of a  steady and reliable character.  Si.liar care should be exercised in the  choice of Administrators for service in France.  They should obviously  be drawn from the best material available, and selected with a special  view to personal capacity, experience and powers to control.j. 3,   We recommend that powers of dismissal and transfer from the Corps  in France should be exercised more freely than at present.  Dismissal  apart from medical grounds is reserved for inefficiency or grave cases  of misconduct and therefore tends under present conditions to leave a  considerable stigma on the girl so returned home.  7e feel that the  conditions in France are so difficult and the moral background of many  localities often so disquieting that women whosje conduct though far  short of being immoral has a tendency to be loose or unsatisfactory shouicI  be removed to a more suitable scene of work.  The authorities nave  dealt very leniently up to the present with unsatisfactory cases of this  type and have been anxious to give the girls every chance to improve.   .7e feel, however, that under the circumstances the welfare of the Corps1  as a whole should be considered before the needs of the individual and\  that the hands of the Administrators should be strengthened in every  possible way as regards dealing with unsuitable personalities in their  units.       The same principle of course should apply to the transfer or removal   of any Administrator who finds herself overweighted by the difficulties   of an onerous position.I  G.  tfe recommend that special attention should be paid to the selectionI   of administrators and to the araft in5 of women to the more lonely unitsj   of the Corps and especially to the advanoes posts where they are brought I  frequently, into touch with men pasting to and from the line.  We areI   satisfied that greater danger exists in these localities than in the   less emotional surroundings oi the Bases and that special vigilanceI   both as regards morale and admin.istrati on is necessary at these points *
,  D.   ./e also recommend that very carefully chosen Women Patrols or  Police should he added to the existing organisation for dealing with  the ./.A.A.C.  Such women should he selected on grounds of special  qualifications, tact and experience.  They should he able to speak  French and have some acquaintance with normal French life and the  point of view of the inhabitants of fcde country,  ,/e feol that the  presence of such patrols or police will be valuable in checking any  undesirable or ncicy behaviour in public places and would act iw.&quot;r.er  as an intelligence body of great service to the Administrators c.v the  Corps,,  Patrols world be a protector to the girls from any possible  bad behaviour on -che part of individual soldiers.  Information wr.s  given us in several places as to the imitation Of the vv,AcA.C. uniform  by women of undesirable character and from our own observation we  have seen evidence of the same kind.  Circumstances of this nature  may lead to charges of a wholly unwarrantable character being brought  against members 0f the V/.A.A.C. and the assistance of patrols in this  and other directions would be of obvious value.       We should  id&quot;that we found some diversity of opinion among com-  petent judges as to the desirability of patrols.  It was su^ested to  us that a fresh sot of women in uniform whose business world ne^osssri-  ly take them into doubtful localities might given rise to further&apos; mis-  understanding with the French and possibly provoke new rumouri of a  detrimental character.  We recognise the possibility of this danger  but wo think that the advantages of women police or patrols il care-  fully chosen outweigh&apos;the objections which&quot; can be urged against them.  Y.W.Q.A.e  We should like to draw attention:tc the admirable reoreative work  carried on in connection with the Corps by the Y.:/.C.A.  Members of  the Corps are net solely dependent on the Y. 7.C.A. for recreation.  The \/.A.A,C* Administrators take an active part in the organisation of  games, sports, etc, for their units and endeavour in every way to  brighten tho lives of the girls.  We feel however it is of.great  advantage to the V/.-.A.A.,C that opportunities for recreation should be  available outside the limits of the hoVtels,  The monotony of lino  in Franco under present conditions is far greater than many peopie  suspect, and some ecoape from the official atmosphere of caimj) or  hostel to the pleasant surroimdings of a well managed Y. &quot;.7.CA.. hut  effects a desirable change of thought and ideas for the girls.  Up  to the present time the Y.-./.C.A. have estabiishod 15 huts and 3 clubs  in Franco and others are in process of construction.  We desire to  emphasise the importance of this prevision of suitable meeting places  for men and women whoso social instincts naturally require sotie outdo-,  \7e hope that tho authorities will encourage and facilitate the fivthoi  establishment of these centres of recreation whioh wo regard as vai-  uable and indeed essential safeguards of the whole social position in  Franco,  CONCLUSION..  In conclusion we desire to repeat our belief that the vague charges  of immoral conduct on a largo scaio brought against tho i7,AeA-0, in  France rest on no foundation in fact.  Thoy arc disproved in the  first ulace by the figures given in paragraph 4 and our personal  observations of the conditions under whioh the girls were living and  working in no sense indicated a troublesome or undesirable state of  affairs.       The general impression loft upon us by the Corps is that of a  healthy, cheerful, self respecting body of young women. ^Hcre andj  there some individual grumbling reached us.  It is inevitable tnat  among a large Corps certain members will be disappointed with their7./surroundings,
surroundings,  and find the conditions of work other  than what theyexpeeted.  She terms of OUJ -reference did not authorise us to dealspecifically with complaints  and we  were not  in a position to make anyinvestigation in this direction.  Such occasional grumblings as reachedus in the course of conversation were of a minor character and thelarge majority of the girls with whom we talked expressed themselves asbeing happy and contented. 7e brought away the impression ox a bog  ofhard-working women, conscious of their position as links in the greatchain of the nationfs purpose and zealous in  its service,  We consideredthat the women have played their part admirably in helping to fulfilthe objects fttf which the Corps was  started and we also consider  that asregards the British Army today the nation has as much  right to be proudof its women in the Auxiliary Force  as of its men.     Wo desire to offer our thanks to the authorities  who facilitatedthe arrangements for our tour and in particular to the Unit Administra-tors with whom we stayed in various  camps and hostels.\Je havethb honour to bo,Sir,Your obedient servants.(Signed)LUCY A.E.DSANE STREAEFIELD(Chairman)*MARY CAR UK.VIOLST R.
