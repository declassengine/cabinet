(Reference Var  Cabinet 377,  Minute  11).               (Previous Papers  Kos.  G.T. 4070.  4076 and  40S1).               The Committee  have considered  and settled  the          accompanying draft  Bill upon  which  they desire  to make          the following observations          Affe Limit.  The age limit  is  fixed  by  the  Bill  at          from 18 to 50, except  that, as regards members  of the          medical profession  (for whom  there  is  an urgent demand)          the limit in raised to 55.    lower  is  taken to  raise          the limit to 55 either generally  or for &amp;  Glass by  Order          in Council.          Broeptions.   The existing exception for men in  holy orders.          and ministers of religion  is  abolished,  but it  is provided          that these persons  shall not,  except with  their consent,          be called up for combatant  service  but may be required          to perform any prescribed wori: in connection with theservice ox tho sick and wounded, whether  in  the fightingline or elsewhere. ^.i.s regards the other exceptions  inbohodulo I to tho principal military  c-ervioe Act  somemodifications are mads.*    ypl^tee^s.   The Bill contains a provision under    which boys from 1? to 18 years of age shall be required    to perform service in the Volunteer **oroe.  *s to th*    desirability of inserting this provision there \:as some                                                 difference
difference of opinion in the Committee, and the matter is left to the War Cabinet to decide.

4. Exemptions. The Bill gives effect to the main proposal of the Minister of National Service that the system of exemptions, whether by Departments or Tribunals shall be superseded by a system of grouping. Under this system all men of military age will be divided by the Minister of National Service into five or more groups in the order in which they are available for military service, having regard to their occupational value to the State. Any claim by a man on account of his individual position (e.g. his special Industrial utility, business obligations or domestic positions) to be planed in a lower group will be decided by the Tribunals. When the groups are formed the Minister of National Service will, on the instructions of the Cabinet, call up such men as may be required, beginning with the fit man in the first group and proceeding until the necessary number is obtained.

Under this system the existing certificates of exemption will be superseded; but it is provided by the Bill that any such certificate shall continue to have effect until the man is called up for service, and upon that event occurring he will be entitled to apply to the Tribunal to be postponed to a later group. It is not proposed to call up men who have been exempted on the ground of a conscientious objection to military service; and
                      *o  3  ** and the machinery  for granting  exemptions  on that ground is kept alive.      The scheme, as modified by the  Committee  and embodied in the draft Bill, does not  involve the abolition of the Local  and Appeal Tribunals,    These Tribunals will have the important function of  dealing with applications for postponement of a man to  a later group in  accordance with instructions to be given (as-now) by Order in Councils   It  is proposed that an applicant shall have no right of  appeal from a Local Tribunal except by leave of tho  Tribunal.   The Tribunals willno  longer have power to grant certificates of  exemption except to conscientious objectors. Ireland.     As regards  the application of  the  Military Service Acts to Ireland, (a question which is  understoodto be reserved for decision by  the War Cabinet) the draftBill is in alternative forms.     Under one form the Bill applies to the whole of theUnited Kingdom,  provision being made for the modificationswhich will be necessary in its  application  to  Ireland.     Under the alternative form power is taken by Orderin Council to apply the Acts to Ireland,  with  such modi-floations as may he necessary.   This form has theadvantage that the provisions for special Tribunals,  etc.,which are necessary if the Act  is to be applied to Ireland,will not  be inserted in the Bill but will appear in theOrder In  Council.    Further,  time would be allowed forvoluntary recruiting,  ete.f  before the Act is put in forceIn  Ireland.     The  proposal,  which was put before the Cabinet,  for                                                   a scheme
                        ***a scheme of compulsory  enrolment by ballot  for  thepurpose of completing and maintaining  the  Irish regimentsof the Line, did not commend  itself to the  Militaryauthorities and has not been  included  in the  draft Bill;but a clause has been inserted for giving effect to theproposal of the Chief Secretary for Ireland underwhich men drilling in rebel volunteer  organisations wouldbe deemed to be enlisted for general service  with theColours,2.
