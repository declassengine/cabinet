Colonel Jones       235pooTMBira is mmozmn qg HI3 igmfi awws Govm^mf                  WAB  CABINBJ&amp;,SIMATXOH. jgS MSTSgB TOgg MB AMERICAS ASSISTANCE.(Oopy of a Beading telegram from the  rims Minister to  orfldated 29th March, 1918,)Secret. We h&amp;ve sow h&amp;d time to consider tht military problemin&quot;toore detail.  We have good hops of. being able to ohecfc theenemy1 s present effort, but we may lose Amiens.  Ths near futurewill show whether or not ha will be able to roach that place.If he sueoeads in doing this the military situation will he verygraven  In any ease, having undoubtedly proved his capacity tobreax through the Western front on a wide Front, it is certainthat his military oommand, if unable to obtain all they aimed atin this battle, Trill immediately begin to re-fit the army foranother blow at the sarliest posaible moment,  fthere ha v/illdeliver it will largely depend on the final result of the presegtoperations^  Tho whole military future will depend upon ourbeing able to re-fit and maintain our armies in time to b$ ableto counter his next blow.  I-ooic&amp;ng past the immediate battlethe fundamental problem before the Allies la that of man-pe^er.        Our losses up to the present in this battle which haaonly lasted a week amount to about 120,000 men.  By draftingin all our resources in trained and partially trained men we canbarely make this good, and in so doing we shall have used up allour trained reserves.  We are therefore taking immediate actionto raise troops by increasing the military age to 50, and takingboys of 18, and by making another large comb-out of industry -a proceeding which will cause the gravest dislocation andhardship to our industries.  We are also prepared to face greattrouble in Ireland* because we feel that it is vital that weshould be able to prove ourselves stronger than the Germansthis summer?        Yet, though by these drastic measures we hope to obtaina reinforcement of between 400s000 and 500,000 men for ourarmy, they will not be sufficiently trained for use in Francefor at least 4 months-  $hare will be a dangerous gap in themonths of May, June and July * that is to say, about the timewhen m may $xpect the enemy to make hie next effort.  If weare therefore to make mx&amp; of holding the enemv then, andpreventing him from reaching e decision in the West, thedeficiency during theses? months must.be made good by Americantroops.  In no other way ca&amp; we ma&amp;t the Allied position sacsr*.        It is estimated by our shipping people here that inshipping to be provided by Great Britain at a great sacrificein other directions, we shall he able to embark in America,in April some 60,000 men.  Admiral Sims estimates that thecarrying capacity of the American troop  fleet is 52,000 mena month.  In addition there ie certain Butoh tonnage availablefor use by America, and we ere obtaining tho use of certainItalian tonnage.  In all we believe that 180,000 AmericanniQ^ can be embarked in April, and rather more in theQuooeediag month8*
        I -want you therefore to formally urge the Prosi- 1dent on &quot;behalf of the British Government to give instructtions for 120,000 infantry to be embarked and sent toEurope per month between now and the  end of July - the  \battalions of these American regiments to be brigaded witBritish or French divisions on the  samo basis as arrange?the case of the six divisions plan.   In accordance withthe resolution of the Military Representatives atVersailles on March 27th and agreed to by General Pershirthe troops transported should be infantry and machine gurunits only.   As was agreed in the  case of the sixdivisions, the battalions when trained can be re-formedinto regiments and sent to General  Pershing as he mayrequire them.        Please see the President about this at once.   Iifno other way  can the hundreds or thousands of trained anhalf-trained men now in America be  made available in thisstruggle;  for they cannot bo organised into separateunits in time.   Should it go against us in their absencetho war might be over and the cause for which the Presidehas so eloquently pleaded might be  lost without Americaboing given an opportunity to put in  more than an insignifleant fraction of her Army.   I believe that the wholefuture of the war will depend on whether the Allies orthe Germans arc first in making good  the losses of this-great battle.   The Germans will certainly not delay aninstant.   They have the man-power  with which to replacethoir losses.   There are also the  Austrians of whom,according to  the German papers to-day, there are already250.000 on the Western Front.   Unless we can re-fit aefast ae they  can, we shall simply give Germany the chanceto  deliver that knock out blow with which its leadershope to win the war.Confidential.        We believe that the shipping of this number of mcan be managed from America^ but that the chief difficultwill be in transportation and terminal facilities.   Werely upon you to see that these obstacles are not allowedto hinder the transportation of these vital troops, otherwise the consequences may be disastrous.   In view of whaPresident said to you in your last interview I am inform!Bake?,., Pershing and Bliss of general substance of thiscommunication and asking them to support the proposalswe are making.
