STOCKHOLM,                                           March 12 th, 1918.Dear Hankey,      It is very important that you should see General Pooleas soon as possible on his return (by this boat),  If Japangoes in alone with carte blanche, the effect on our futurerelations with Russia will be very grave.  If she goes infor, or with the Entente, it is essential that from theoutset the Russians should know what is in view.  There oughtcertainly to be Russian volunteer units with every expeditionaryforce that  .oes in, and the programme of these units, nodoubt at present taking the form of their oath will be theirpolicy snd ours for the future of Russia,  It is also mostnecessary that the work done by others and myself insideShould be in line with the programme ox these units.   I askeda good representative general of the Provisional Governmentfor a minimum programme of this kind and he met the need byputting dowfc only what can ufcite all elements and parties,-namely the Constituent Assembly.  It is very simple and Pooleand others strongly support it.  I em sending it to you. I goon myself shortly, I hope; so I am ansious that all effortsshould be in line.                              Yours sincerely,                                (Sgd,) BERNARD PARES-     Suggested formula of the objects and oath of RussianVolunteer Units accompanying Japanese or other ExpeditionaryForces in Russia,                 suggested byK.M. OBEROUCHSFF, General Commanding the Kiev Military District                  under the Provisional Government, 1917.Bernard PARS3                  This formula i3 supported byHonourable Francis 1ISDLEYBrigadier-General POOLEColonel THQRNEILLColonel ^EYSS.
For the Constituent Assembly     Electi-ons on the accepted democratic formula:(franchise universal (21 years$.  equal, direct and secret).     Electoral campaign and elections absolutely free.     All the population to be disarmed (or shot).  Arms tobe distributed only to the troops and militia (police) formedon the basis of the above programme.     KestDration everywhere of the organs of local government(town and country) according to the law already promulgated bythe provisional Government.     A temporary, and later permanent Administration, constitutfrom all elements and parties which accept the above programme,     A Federative Russia (Federativnaia Rus: United States ofRussia).     All other questions of the permanent order to be settledby the Constituent Assembly.     The strictest discipline: absolute-obedience to the  -commanding officers.     An army ordinance (law) to define the limitations of thepowers of officers: courts representing interests both ofofficers and men to settle all questions as to the legality oforders,     The enclosed suggestion explains itself and will beexplained to you by General Pools,  who returns with the freshesinformation on Russia.  General Oberoucheff,  with whom I makethe suggestion, has views representative of very many others:he thinks the proposed formula will carry general acceptanceamong the Russians,  and he is anxious to take part in sucha movement.  The &apos; suggestion is supported by all those of our ov;best workers in Russia to whom I have been able to show it.     If Japan acts only for herself,  the most seriousconsequences may follow in Russia.   If Japan carries out acommon progrroame of the Entente, 3till more if there are otherEntente expeditions from other sides, it is essential that froathe outset such expeditions should be accompanied by Russianvolunteer units, including men generally representative  ofdifferent elements in Russia, and that these units should havea common programme announced to the Russia people at thestart.  The object of such a programme ie to unite all classesand.opinions and therefore puts a minimum on which all canagree, leaving all further questions to Russia herself,  thati3 to the Constituent Assembly.
