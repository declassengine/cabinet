&quot;This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic  Majesty^ Government.)                 29th March 1018.ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET ON THERUSSIAN BLACK SEA FIjEET AND THE SFBECT OF ITSPOSSIBLE CAPTURE BY THE GERMANS.Prepared in compliance with WarCabinet 369 Minute No.7 ofMarch 21st 1918.         This question was considered by the All&quot;ed NavalCouncil at their recent meetings  (12 - M March  1918) andthe following conclusions were&quot;reached:-   (i)   If Germany so desires, she will have no greatdifficulty in obtaining possession of the Russian BlackSea Fleet, and if she obtains nossession, she will also beable, though with some difficulty, to man at least themost modern units of the Fleet, using either Russian orTurkish personnel or personnel transferred from Germany.Time will be required to train the personnel.   The shipsthemselves for a long period have carried out no seagoingservice, and are not in good condition, and a periodvariously estimated at from two to six months must elapseafter their acquisition by Germany before they could berestored to seagoing fighting efficiency.   (ii)   If Germany does obtain possession of the modernunits of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, mail them and put themm an efficient state for fighting., with a view to operationsoutside the Dardanelles, the Allies will obtain sufficientnotice through their channels of intelligence to enable thenecessary re-arrangements to be made of the forces in theEastern Mediterranean.   The Intelligence Depart/rents ofthe several Ministries of Marine should pay especial regardto information on this matter.   There is also theprobability that warning of the impending exit of heavyenemy forces from the Dardanelles will be afforded by stepsbeing taken in advance to clear a passage through the Mine-fields at the entrance.2,-    It is considered that the following is the maximumof the Russian Ships likely to be so used&apos;by the Germans,for which provision must be made:-           2 Dreadnought Battleships           5 Pre-Dreadnought Battleships           2 Cruisers           1 Light Cruiser          16 Destroyers           6 Submarines,3,-   A table is attached giving a summary of the AlliedFleets in the Mediterranean, and of the vessels which                                                   might
might become available for enemy sew ice.4.-   It will be seen that the Allies have a sufficiencyof Naval force to meet the situation;  but new dispositionsare, required.5.-   There are two conditions to be considered:-    (1)  The containing of the enemy&apos;s force in the               Adriatic:    (2)  The containing of the enemy&apos;s force in the               Dardanelles.         To meet the first we have an overwhelming force inthe French and Italian Fleets;  but the situation&quot;isweakened owing&apos;to these Fleets being divided, the formerbeing at Corfu, the latter at Taranto.   To put to sea fromTaranto the Italian Fleet have to Dass through the narrowpassage from the Mar Piccolo - a lengthy operation, and onewhich, in the event of damage to the&quot;bridge which crosses it,might be seriously prolonged, and thus prevent a junction ofthe two fleets until   too late.         To meet the second condition, at present, there areonly two British and two French battleships in the Aegeanof inferior speed, which are not sufficient.         In these circumstances, the suggestion made by theFvench Naval Authorities, viz: for the Italian Fleet toooin the French Fleet, and for a force of French battleshipsto reinforce the squadron in the Aegean, is conei  :ed in.
