Colonel JoaM&quot;opert&apos;129th March, 1918.), ffiELEASS OF MEN EMPLOYED BY THE ADMIRALTY*W      (War Cabinet  571 - Minute 10) ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM BY NAVY CONTROLLER FOR WAR CABINET,     Under the revised schedule of protected occupations,the Minister of National Service estimates that the Admiralty&apos;A&apos; Firms should contribute approximately 18,500 men, and theRoyal Dockyards 1,000 men.     While theso numbers, so far as the Army is concerned,are not large, the Minister of National Service contendsthat the moral effect upon the engineers in other Firms notworking for the Admiralty would be disastrous if the AdmiraltyFirms did not contribute their quota.     Mr. Allen Smi*&apos; ,Chairman of the Managing Committee of the EngineeringEmployers1 Federation, agrees with this view.     Thy Minister recognises that an adjustment must subsequentlybe made to give to marine engineering not only these men whoare now taken away, but the additional men who will shortlybe required5 but he urges that the Admiralty should facilitatethe levy of men now proposed from their Firms, and should lookto him for the subsequent adjustment6     I am advised thatif the levy is conducted with due regard to the necessitiesof individual cases, it should be possible to withdraw thisnumber of men without any disastrous effect,  but&apos;there willundoubtedly be an outcry from the employers.     Moreover, output will suffer seriously,  unless theMinister of National Service diverts suitable  substitutesto Admiralty Firms  quickly and in sufficient  numbers.    Uptill now we have been given priority on paper,  but  not the  men.
     It is for the War Cabinet to decide whether the roraladvantage on the minds of the A.S.E. generally outweighsthe moral disadvantage in the mJnds of those primarilyresponsible for the output of marine engines,     Ar. Allen Smith recommends that the method of levy           81ought to be/uniform percentage on the total number ofmale employees in the case of every engineering firm, andthat before a pivotal man is called up employers shouldhave a right to appeal.   The Admiralty are disposed tofavour such a procedure/ but the Ministry of Munitions saythat, having regard to the immensely greater number of firmswith whom they have to deal and the larger number of menwho are to be called up, time will not permit of this   o-tracted procedure0     If the Cabinet order tirs levy, I am of opinion     (a) That the employers concerned should be informedat once, while the pressing necessities of the Army inFrance are prominently in their minds, and -     (b) That full responsibility should be laid on theMinister of National Service to provide efficient sub-stitutes in the number and at the time they are required.If the Minister fails to provide  efficient substitutes,output will undoubtedly suffer.     I have agreed this memorandum with the Chairman ofthe Engineering Employers&apos; Federation and the MarineEngine Builders&apos; Technical Committee of that Federation,who suggest the addition of the two following paragraphs(c)&apos;and (d).     The instruction of the Cabinet is desired to give effectto paragraph (c)paragraph (d) can be arranged:-
     &quot;(c) That in individual cases  of  officeirs  and men whoare  of pivotal importance to the firms, the Cabinet shouldinstruct the Minister  of National  Service and  the AdjutantGeneral respectively to do their utmost to meet thenecessities of the marine engineers by allowing the officersor men in question to  remain with  or  be returned to thefirms.  I a:s of opinion that by meeting the necessities ofthe  firms in individual cases, and by returning to them afew  of their junior managers who are  already serving, wecan very largely mitigate their objections to  the proposedrecruitment,     (d) That concurrently with or immediately after C olevy, responsible technical officers  should be sent roundto the firms affected  to adjust differences in complementso that the firms which have more than their appropriatenumber of men should contribute to the necessities of thefirms which have been unduly reduced, to the end that theundoubted shortage of  skilled men may be distributed equallyand not unfairly over  the firms,   I understand that thenecessity of such an enquiry into the relative dilution atvarious firms was accepted by the Minister of Munitionsin October last in conference  with the Engineering Em-Dlovers1  Federation, -and an examination of this natureapplied to all engineering firms will undoubtedly gofar to remove any impression of unequal treatment as be-twe-en firm and firm.&quot;                              (Signed) A.  G.  ANDERSON,Forwarded     ERIC GEDDES         29. 3.  18.
