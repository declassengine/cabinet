Ports.     The release of Port Labour is being seriously delayed; anda direct Cabinet Order is necessary if this quota is to be obtained.It is suggested     1.   That a clean cut should be made of men v/ho are over          18-8. but have not attained the age of 25 by 1st          January. 1918.   This 7*ould give approximately 1,000.          The balance should be obtained by an Order to the          Board of Trade to allocate quotas to oach port; and          a time limit should be given ending on 31st May,by          -which all those men should have been posted.Agriculture *     The quota is very small but possible methods of increasingthis will be considered later.Public Utility,, Companies, &amp;o.     The quota of 8,000 will be obtained by arrangement with theMinistry of Munitions.   It will probably be found necessary toreduce the number actually to be released from certified under-takings and add it to the ordinary munitions quota.   This willbe a subject for mutual arrangement.Balanco of men.     By cancelling occupational exemptions and by concentrating thertiashine upon this section of the Register the quota of 27,000should be completed by the end of July.     It is hoped that the number of A.4s recruited this year willconsiderably exceed 120,000. &apos;  Up to the present 39,428 A.4s ofGrade 1. and 11,614 A.4s of lower grades have been recruited.     Assuming the rate of intake which has obtained since thebeginning of the year is maintained, the intake of A.4s for 1918should be:-Grade  1         160,000Lower Grades      45,000205,000
     Provided the Government Departments carry out their releasesat the above rates, the, limiting factor at present is the exam-ining capacity of Medical Boards.   Most of the Medical Boardsconsist of three Members and a Chairman.   It is proposed thatBoards should, in future, not consist of more than two or threemembers in all.   This will enable a number of travelling MedicalBoards to be established, as may be necessary,&apos;and by speedingup the rate of examinations from 60 to 80, or 80 to 90 a day,they should be able to deal with approximately 90,000 men a week.The Adjutant General has offered to supply 40 Army doctors toreinforce the National Service Boards.     I understand that the dilution staff of the Ministry ofMunitions will require a certain increase to enable them to cope&apos;with an acc&amp;erated rate of release.     It may be necessary to reduce the length .of calling up noticefrom 14 to 7 days.   This does not require any statutory pcrmis-sion; but a statement should be made in the House.     Without raising the military age, or applying compulsory ser-vicc to Ireland, the only pools from which any further large num-ber of men could be drawn, without affecting seriously the outputof munitions, would be coal mines and agriculture.   After the50,000 miners have been taken, there will be approximately 200,000Grade 1. men over 18-8 still left in coal mines.   I am con- .suiting with the Coal Controller as to the maximum number of thesewhich could still be released if every possible economy is in-troduced.    Any such further release would have to be made fromwhatever coal field the men could best be spared, and must directlyover-ride the resolution of the Miners Federation that the quotasshould be applied all over the coal fields of Great Britian, pro-portionately to the total number of men employed; and the menwould have to be taken up to the limit of military age, as theycan be3t be spared.     There are approximately 80,000 Grade 1 men over 18-8.employed in agriculture.    I would suggest that the Cabinetshould order the release of a definite number of men fromagriculture, the Board of Agriculture to allocate the numbersto the various county committees, and place a time limit on theperiod of release.
     It must not be forgotton that a large number of boys who arcleaving school are passing into agriculture each year, while analmost complete protection is afforded to all males who werewhole time engaged In agriculture on the 1st June 1917.     I would refer the Cabinet to Tables A. k B. set out at thoend of my memorandum G. 174 dated 15 Nov. 1917, and which showthe numbers of men In various industries by ago groups.     In order to secure prompt releases from munitions I askthe Cabinet to direct the Admiralty to release their agreedquota of 12.500 men from Admiralty &quot;A&quot; firms, and 1,000 men fromRoyal Dock yard and Naval establishments by equal instalments,postings to be completed by 30th June.     In ordor to create the largost possible reservo for the Armyand the Air Force, I would also ask that tho Cabinet shouldorder the cessation of Naval recruiting of all ratings fit forgeneral service over the age of 18 years, with the exception ofa limited number of skilled ratings, the number to be fixed bythe Ministry of National Service after consultation with theAdmiralty.   This requires a direct order upon the Navy, as theNavy has over 100 direct recruiting establishments of their own.The matter is urgent as large numbers of men will certainlyendeavour to enlist voluntarily In the Navy as soon a3 themachine is&apos; speeded up.     I have already, in my Memorandum G. 174, submittod to theWar Cabinet an estimate of the number of men fit for generalservice who could be obtained by raising the military age, andalso by&quot;applying compulsory service to Ireland, (sec page 9,paragraph 3, and page 10, paragraph 7).   I ostimato that byraising the age limit to 45 approximately 150,000 men fit forgeneral service would become liable to recruitment, and of theseat least 50,000 could be made available for military service.By raising the age limit to 50 a further 250,000 fit for generalservice would become liable to recruitment,  of whom I haveestimated that 60,000 could bo mado available for military sorvica.     My estimate with regard to Ireland is that within the presentlimits of military age 150,000 men fit for general service couldbe recruited..   By raising the ago to 45 a further 25,000 couldbe obtained, and another 25,000 if the age limit were raised to50.   The basis on Vihich this calculation is made Is as follows:-     At the dato of the National Register the male populationof military age Yfas nearly 550,000, of vfoom about 50,000 hadjoined the Army hj the end of 1917, leaving say 500,000.   Ofthese probably 2Qf) were unfit for service leaving 400,000 as fitfor service in all categories.
9 QI 024/3/18,A. C. GEDDES.    On the same basis as holds in Great Britain about 250,000men of military age would be indispensable;  but the con-ditions are altogether different.   There is not the sameindustrial activity, and there is still available forsubstitution purposes a large female population.         Of the 400,000 men, therefore, it seems fair toconsider say that not more than 150,000 should be indispensable.This leaves 250,000, out of whom it should be possible toobtain 150,000 Grade 1 men.         The figures for men over the present military agehave been calculated on the same basis as for Great Britain.         I have tried to shew what are the possibilities ofobtaining further recruits.  The more immediate neGd is fortrained men.   .There are at the present time in shipyards,munition works and agriculture a large number of trained men.It is quite possible that some of the men in the agriculturalcompanies, who were of lower category, may have become fitfor general service.  My Department has been in consultationwith the Tvar Office and the Ministry of Munitions on thissubject;  and I understand that the Adjutant-General ismaking all possible arrangements with the Departments concerned&apos;.         In order to stimulate Tribunals, I have alreadyaddressed meetings of the chairmen and clerks of Tribunals inWales, and in the South Western, West Midlands and NorthVYestern Regions;  and impressed upon them the urgent need ofmen for the Army.  I have arranged to address similar meetingsin the Yorkshire and East Midlands Regions during the presentweek.
