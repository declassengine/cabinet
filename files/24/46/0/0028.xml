document is th*property ofTHE CONTROL OF LABOUR  SUPPLY.MEMORANDUMBY TEEMINISTER OF LABOURON THEPROPOSALS OF THE MINISTER  OF NATIONAL SERVICE
     The  proposals  of the  Minister  of national  Service  for the transferof the Employment Mxchangos  to  his  Department,  (G.2.3984), of which Ilearnt for the  first  tii:.e  from  his  memorandum to  the Cabinet, wouldresult in:-     (1)   An  intimate partnership and association between the Governmentmachinery for dealing with labour supply and  that for conscription forthe Army  respectively.   This would  be inevitable  if the proposals woreadopted and would be  emphasised by  the  fact that  the control over all thework  of the Ministry  of National Service in each  Region is vested in theDirector  or Recruiting.     (2)  ,The separation from the Ministry of Labour of a large part ofits most  Irportant  functions, including some  which are moBt jealouslywatched by organised  labour. In particular,  they necessarily involvetransferring  from my  Departmentto the Ministry  of National Service theresponsibility for  dealing with labour  resettlement after the war.     Compulsory recruiting is a necessary evil  7/hich is not regarded withaffection by  any class of  the community,  least  of all by organised labour.There is  nothing to be gained,  and  everything to  lose, by associating .with  it the Employment Exchanges, the success of  whose 7/ork must dependon the voluntary and  sympathetic co-operation of  employers and workmen.I am  confident  that the effect  would  be to create a feeling of suspicionand opposition which  would very materially reduoe the utility which theExchanges now have  as the  machinery for carrying  out the Governmentpolicy with regard  to labour supply.     The  severance  of the  Employment  Exchanges  would deprive the Ministryof Labour of  the position  which it  is naturally entitled to occupy andorganised labour would view  with serious alarm  such a mutilation of theLinistry^ functions, which  thoy would  with good  reason rogard as abreach of faith. The daily  work of the Exchanges brings them into ontact with  innumerable problems,  small and  great, in which labour isvitally interested, and the  settlement  of which cannot be divorced from ho Ministry  of labour without  depriving the  latter of its essential haracter* I observe that Sir  Auckland Goddes  suggests the addition of nspection of factories and  mines to  my Department, but I venture to oint out that  this is a matter which should  be put forward, if at all, y the Homo Office  or tho  Ministry  of Labour.     One  of the main  functions  with which the Ministry  of Labour was nvostcd  when it was  set uu  was that  of preparing for,  and ultimately ealing with, labour  resettlement after the war.   Tho steps that havo ocn  taker, include  the establishment  of Local Advisory Committees in omioction with each  Exchange and a Central labour Resettlement Committee o co-ordinate them.   The  establishment and working cf the Industrial ouncils, which are pre-eminently matters for the Ministry of Labour, -re closely connected with labour resettlement.  The association of the anistrv of Labour  with labour  resettlement after the war has been made ublic  property and,  I think I  can  fairly say,  has met with general ^probation,   I do  not think that tho transfer  of these functions to he Ministry of National Service would  commend  itself to the general tablic   nor&apos; do I think the cublic would be reassured, as Sir Auckland ^ddes&apos;assumes, with  regard  to  the  temporary  character  of his Ministry if xhovj  were transferred to it the largo permanent stafi now belonging
to the Employment Exchanges.  I am quite certain that it would hereceived with hitter opposition &quot;by organised labour, and I, personally.could not be in any way a party to such a proposals     The considerations above-mentioned are, I think sufficient tocondemn the proposals, and I can therefore pass lightly over some ofthe other objections.  For instance,  the adoption of the nroposal wouldmean divided control of the Exchanges in Great Britain and Irelandrespectively, since Sir Auckland Geddes has no jurisdiction in Ireland;again, the transfer of the Exchanges must carry with it the responsibil-ity for a great volume of 7/ork done by these Offices, which is not evenlogically part of the functions of the Ministry of National Serviceas uudo-rjtood by Sir Auckland Geddes (e.g. the administration of Un-employmeno Insurance for 3-g- million workers) and would, I fear, over-weight his machine and make it impossible for any single Minister todeal adequately both with them and with the hroad questions of policywhioh properly fall to him.     The demands of the Shipyard Employers and Trade Unions, and theprinciples laid down in the second paragraph of Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;memorandum are in my opinion adequately met by the distribution offunctions between the Ministry of National Service and my Department aslaid -3own in the agreement made between us on 31st August, 1917, andapproved by the War Cabinet.  All that is necessary is that the agree-ment should be fairly carried out and that the Ministry of NationalService should confine itself strictly to laying down policy withregard to man powery and my Department to giving executive effect tothat policy.  The conditions suggested in the second paragraph ofSir Auckland Geddes1 memorandum are all satisfied by the presentorganisation of the Employment Exchanges, which has been decentra.lisedby the outset.     The Minister of National Servico states that under the presentdistribution of functions between the Departments &quot;there has been delay;there has been friction;  there has been inefficiency&quot;.  Ha quotes asingle example, the alleged failure of the Employment Exchanges to giveeffect to decision of his Labour Priority Committee with regard to rsupply of labour.  To this it is sufficient answer to say that thismatter was reoently considered by the Labour Priority Committee,  whichdecided on 20th March to  record in its minutes that the explanationfurnished by the Ministry of Labour was satisfactory.  The character  ofthe problom is such that  it could not be affected by any transfer ofcontrol.  I do not know whether the Minister of National Service hasany other examples to quote; I do know that he has not brought any ofthem to my notice for investigation before putting forward a sweepingcharge of this description against my Department.     The real trouble is that the Ministry of National Service havenot been content to abide by the spirit or even by the letter of theagreement of August 31st.  The work of my Officers is continuallyhampered by the attempted interference of the Ministry of NationalService in their executive work.  I will quote only the most reoentand most glaring example, where a wholesale invasion has beenattempted under cover of the arrangements for decentralisation towhich Sir Auckland Geddes referred.  The document (N.S.I.N0.33. of1918) dealing with these arrangements whioh was issued not only withoutthe concurrence of my Department but  in the face of their expressobjections, purports to assign to the local Representatives of theMinistry of National Service executive functions with regard tolabour supply and in one place even to give them control over theExchanges.  I understand that this document was issued in advance ofTreasury authority and it would appear also that it took for grantedthe approval of the War Cabinet to the proposal now under constdera-tion.  To describe this method of procedure is, I think to character-2./ise
ise it sufficiently.     Sir Auckland Geddes appears to assume that if the  Exohanges  weredirectly under his control they would perform their work more  efficiently.While I do not wish to suggest that the Exchanges and the EmploymentDepartment are as efficient as they would be if 1,180 members  of  themale staff (or over 40 ) were not absent owing to service with theColours, I can honestly assert that, when allowance is made for this fact,their efficiency is of a very high order and compares favourably  with  &apos;that of any other Government Department; I fail to see  how it  could beimproved if they were merged into the Hinistry of National Service. Thework of the Exchanges speaks for itself.  During the years 1916 and1917 respectively 1,351,406 and 1,375,198 individuals were placed inemployment.  Over 25,000 women have been enrolled for the J.A.A.C andin addition large numbers under other schemes;  a great  variety ofspecial schemes of enrolment and other war time arrangements  of immensecomplication are worked with surprising smoothness.  The insurance of3-55- million workpeople against unemployment is maintained; and  far-reaching plans for demobilisation are in the meantime being worked out.With regard to shipyard labour, to which Sir Auckland Geddes  callsspecial attention, the Exchanges have during the last 13 weeks placed18^754 workpeople on merchant shipbuilding and marine engineering;during the last eight weeks over, 3000 unskilled workmen have  beenenrolled and transferred to shipyards (  a larger number than  the  yardswere able to use) and the greater part of the work in connection  withthe release of men from the Home Army for the shipyards has been  done bythe Officers of the Employment Department.  The classification of theIndex Cards in the census of the Home Army on which the whole  of  thearrangements for releasing men depend, an undertaking of great magnitude,was carried out without a hitch by the Employment Department.   I  invitethe Minister of National Service to name a single particular  in whichthese arrangements could have been improved under his own administration.     The Minister of National Service refers to Employers and  TradeUnionists who daily press upon him the need of improving the working ofthe Exchanges.  He has not referred any of them to the  Minister ofLabour, who is responsible, and until he does so^, I cannot take anyaccount of them.     To sum up my views as to the manner in which the position shouldbe dealt with, I consider that it should be laid down in the  mostdefinite terms that the Ministry of national Service is not responsiblefor executive action in connection with labour supply;   thisresponsibility should rest with the Ministry of Labour and with theMinistry of Labour alone and I know of no ground for supposing thatthat ministry will be unable to discharge it*                                           (Signed) G3Q.
