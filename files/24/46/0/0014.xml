Its main provisions have met with generalapproval and such criticisms as have been made were confinedto one or two specific Clauses.     Deputations representative of some of the principal industries     of the Country whose interests are likely to be affected by     the proposals of the Education Bill.  I have, in many cases,     been able to remove their apprehensions and suggest possible     solutions of their difficulties.3.        A number of Circulars have recently been issued by the     Department to Local Education Authorities dealing with     questions of Food Production and Economy.  The Authorities     have been requested to co-operate with the Ministry of Food:-     (a) by allowing the services of teachers in Public Elementary         Schools to be utilised in connection with the arrangements         for the equitable distribution of food;     (b) by handing over some of the most suitable School Cookery         Centres for the purpose of National Kitchens;  and     (c) by making the fullest possible use of the services cf the         Cookery Teachers for instruction in economical cookery.          They have also been asked to assist the Food Production     Department by granting extended holidays in rural areas so as     to enable boys over 12 years of age to assist in agricultural     operations.4.        Other Circulars recently issued by the Department have     dealt with such matters as the establishment of a Block Grant     for Special Subjects Instruction with the object of reducing     the clerical work in the offices both of the  Local Education2.During the past few weeks I have received a number of1.Authorities
