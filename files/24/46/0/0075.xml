     The Committee proceeded to consider the Draft Bill whichhad been circulated by the Minister of National Service (G.T. 4057).AgeLimits * (1)Boysof17/The Chairmanof thefor boysof the V   indicated that In the view     it should be compulsoryf 17 to be enrolled in Glass Cunteers and to attend the number-Cab:! netoof drills lan.d down for this class,(War Cabinet 377 Min0. 8).The Committee agreed(a)that the Bill should &quot;deem boys of17 to have become volunteers&quot;and the No. of drills could be       in a schedule.staged18 - 50(b)(c)51 - 55-Doctors                               The next group should be from 18                               to 50 i:et to the attainment of                               the 51st birthday.                               The next group, 51 to 55, should                               be deemed to be Volunteers with                               power by order in Council to                               deem them to be enlisted,                           (d) That a special clause should be                               inserted to meet the need for                               doctors, making the upper                               compulsory age limit 55 instead of                               50.,   .  With reference to (c) above Sir A,Geddes said that he wasconfronted with a serious problem of labour substitution^romnext autumn onwards indentured labour would rapidly expire andowing to tonnage difficulties a fresh supply would not boreturned.   Between the ages of 51 and 55 there were some200,000 men per annum available, about half of whom would be fitfor labour in Prancec  Without using these abroad it was hardto discover an adequate supply to take the place of theindentured labourers,     Mr,Hayes Fisher thought the House of Commons would pressfor the retention of the men of the group 51 to 55 withinthe Home Forces 0Exceptions *  (2).  The Committee reviewed the Exceptions nowIn force under the Military Service Actsand agreed that.     (a)   The first Exception should read           &quot;men ordinarily resident in His           Majesty&apos;s Dominions.abroad,&quot;     (b)   The second Exception should remain           as at presents     (c)   The third Exception should read           &quot;men serving in the Navy, or the           Royal Marines&quot;,       (d)  The fourth Exception, which deals           with Ministers of Religion, should           be amended so a3 to provide that           men in holy orders or regular                7
 Each area would be allotted its quo.ta starting --.with group 1, then Croup II, and&apos;so on till Croup V,wast reached, if found necessary  ,    Tho functionof the local authority would be  to adjuciioate onindividual considerations-(o) above- and they woulddo so on the basis of a definite oode of instructions,Fit men would, fall to the medical authorities, andcases of occupation to the Reserved OccupationsCommittee.

(e) The fifth Exception,as altered by tho Military Service     (Review of Exceptions ) Aot 1017, should not be further     ajLtered and the House of Commons should be informed     that no disturbance of the pledge given under this head     was contemplated, (f) The Exception dealing with 3?risoner8 of War should     be repealed (ki.S,Act session ,8, Section 8),(3)  The Committee next considered the proposals dealing     with the granting of certificates of Exemption and     the machinery for granting them.     Sir A,Ge&amp;des explained that he had not contemplated     dispersing the present personnel of tho Tribunals,.     In the next place he wished the authority ,whether     the present tribunals or some re-adjustment of them     should work to a definite code . The reoruiting     machine shoulo. work subject to friction from three     sources, which might delay a man in taking up mil-     -itary service.           (a)  His medioal fitness.  That was a                question for a medical board..           (b)  Eis occupational valuo tothe State,                He proposed that every mar. engaged in                industry should be put in one of five                groups in order of availability for                service, according to their medical                grade,, age, group and. occupation,                Croup y, being the last to be oalled                up,           (o)  His individual position,  which would                be affected by occupational or social                considerations or bothf-e,g, a man                might be a pivotal mag in a business,                the last male in the family,or have                many dependants.
       In reply to questions, Sir A. Geddeo st^rted-vthat-fcjte--was an enormous amount of physical unfitness in the nation.Between 18 and 43 there were still almost about 900,000 fitmen in civil life.  His Department had started out to obtain        .t&apos;nis year.  Excluding boys some 120,000 had been         since January.  Of  the 450, 000 perhaps not morethan 300,000 would be in Grade I.  An extra 450,000 or500,000 had now to be found  during this year, but thisassumed raising the upper age limit  of 43.450,000 1obtainedTo          meet criticism it might be possible to retain thepresent tribunals and take power to issue new Regulationsfor putting in force the procedure indicated above.   Thepersonnel of the Tribunals would w   certainly be  used.                  The Committee requested  the Minister  of  .              National Service to modify the form  of the Billof th-&quot;-Tcun^V-so,that it would^appear -less menacing to  thetry, and  *  I social organisation^which had been made that  thealvJ.meet theJ  Bill completely disestablished the presentc r I \T i c l sm  jBilltribunals.Jonscientous  Objectors,4.

Mr. Duke explained the strong objections toapplying conscription to Ireland and his preferencefor a system of ballot, following upon opportunityfor voluntary enlistment with special inducementsof separation allowances choice of corps, etc.  Hehad drafted a suitable clause (G.T. 4052).     TheCommittee were agreed that whetherConscription on the English model, or Mr. Duke&apos;salternative method, was adopted, the Irishtribunals would have to be nominated bodies, witha substantial military element, and they would havet8ns%aDu^arylose co**operation with the Royal IrishThe Committee adjourned untij Saturday,&apos;March 30th,11.30 a.m.at(signed)   T.
