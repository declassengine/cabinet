Minutg 9, and       War Cabinet 576 A.)ADMIRALTY MEMORANDUM FOR THE WAR CABINET         Upon throe occasions during the last week the question of 1hie Navy handing over personnel to the Army in the present emergency has been &quot;raised at Cabinet without apparently appropriateI information being before the Cabinet.         The impression left upon the Admiralty representatives upon[eaoh occasion was that the tone of the discussion became one of complaint against the Navy for not being prepared to 11 help thejAmy&quot; and of not being prepared to &quot;thin the line&quot; when the Armylad to  thin theirs.        Now that the stress of last week is passed I venture to urgeu-on the Cabinet that the question is one which, cn all grounds.should not be considered hastily but with dun deliberation, if itis to be farther considered at this juncture.        The desire of us all is to make the best use of availableresources in men and material.  If it is better to transfer menIron the Navy and put them into the Army, I trust we will come topat decision after careful survey of the question in all its[spects.        There have been two distinct demands made upon the Navy :-             (1) To give &quot;some&quot; highly trained l&amp;rines to stiffen                      battalions and batteries in France.&apos;             (2) To surrender men without military training to be                      turned into soldiers.        As regards (2), we have agreed to suspend recruiting of all p technically  skilled ratings to enable the full flow of  ^itits to go into the Army.  Of the trained Royal Marine Forces Gained by the Admiralty, the following numbers are  serving in
9Lposts to the reliof of the Army.  This  is  exclusive  o    arinoport labour in Prance :-           In Pronee -R.N.D.R.M.A,683018608,690Iiudros -     (all but 500 are being, and        have boon, largely replaced        by nen unfit for rroneral        service)Coast Defence, U.X. -     (largoly and ilncroasingly old,        unfit j or very young men -        except in.

Wo uay ho able to releasea few more inen frc..: this category under certain conditions, butobviously it is fronthe 16,970 Jlarines afloat that anyconsiderablo nunber rrast be sought-, and, -practically speaking,that iieans from the Grand Fleet.  If not fro:i the Grand Fleet,tho sane conditions as apply thero apply to detached units.     Prom the discussions at Cabinet, it appeared that certainof those present were under tho :L.rpression that Marines on hoardship could, unlike the bluejacket portion of the crew, be&quot;Withdrawn without detriment to the firktinr of tho ship in a-ieet action.   There is, I a\i told, an uninfomsd viow trat
                                                                  L o oMarines are carried on H.M, Ships for landing parties, sentry duties,guards of honour, bands, etc., and are not like bluejackets anintegral part of tho fighting crew of the Ship,  To show the usemade of Marines on typical ships, I enclose the quarter bills ofa battle ship (Al) battle-cruiser (A2) and cruiser (A3). Any men^thdrawn froixi these posts must be replaced or the turret battery oroommunioations will be shortliandod fc its rapidity of fire diminished.If we replace them we only attain tho result of taking a highlytrained man at this work out of the Fleet and putting him intotho Army for which he is- only partially trained and replacing himin the ship with an untrained man.  Any influx of untrair 1&quot; men in gheBarine complement of the Grand Fleet would, with no shadow ofdoubt, very seriously impair its efficiency until the^ weretra-inecU  It must be recognised that a Marine on board shipis a highly trained and skilled rating irrespective of hislimited infantry training.    Owing to the present situation, the             beingGrand Fleet is/kept specially, by Admiralty orders, at theshort notice to put to sea, and in the opinion of the Board itwould be in the highest degree unwise to call the c-in-C toLondon.   The Board would not be prepared to take the responsibilityof doing so.         The Naval Members of the Board have no doubt that theO-in-Cs views would coincide exaotly with their views, b-4 inthe to them inconceivable hypothesis that he was prepared to surrender a part of his Marines, the Naval Members of the Board are unanimous that they could not see their way to concurring in bis view.  I may state, for the information of the War Cabinet, that  I have,  since I became First Lord, made it my business to learn something of the  organisation of H.H. Ships, and I entirely associate myself with them in this view.         I turn now to  a  general  suggestion that because the manning Qf H.!,!. Ships  was increased about 20 per cent since the outbreak
 Go of war, it could be reduced nowe The attached statement  (B) shows the manning,in numbers, of typical German and British Ships - which shows that in comparative ships even the numbers borne in war are below the Germans1 poace complement which is known to be far below the numbers actually borne in war.   The increases made on and since the outbreak of war mentioned by I^Lr60hurohill at Cabinet  the other day were mainly stokers and seamen and to a far less extent are these reflected in Marines,  In the case of Marines it is enly in the guns crews that increases have been made owing to introduction of director firing, additional range fir: .rs,etc. If the increase in personnel    necessary at the outbreak of war, it is certainly no loss necessary now,         The  suggestion made by the 0oI9G,S, ,that if the Army has to thin  its line the Navy should do so also to help the Army - if it was made seriously -*does not bear examination.         First.- Naval losses in surface and submarine warfare and in safeguarding  the army and its supplies with phonomonal success at sea  have been serious a  But  it must be remembered  that if thetattle line on land is thinned the  personnel and material can be replace!.  If9on the other hand5 a Capital Ship is lost owing to ineffi oient or insufficient  iLBnningj, the  ship for the  purposes of the waris irrepiacea-ble,         Secondly.&apos;- the thinner the Army and the loss its reservesat home,  the  greater need for protection by the  Navy and for its high efficiency.         Thirdly,- the thinned Army is  meeting,  if we may credit, thereports  we receive, with a still more  thinned enemy,,  The Grand Fleetwould meet the High Seas Fleet in full  power at  the moment  chosenby the enemy.  The  Cabinet is  so fully  informed on oomparative strengths  of  opposing forces  and the practical certainty of  losses in capital ships to us and not to the  enemy before we  ever  joinedbattle that I  need not enlarge upon this  aspect  of  the  question.
        Modern Fleets converge at over 50 miles an hour and rapidityof overwhelming fire  at  the earliest possible moment is of vital andimperative  importance-,.  It would in the opinion of the Board ofAdmiralty,  he  an act  of  lmdnesS in such circumstances to take any stepa-euoh as reduotion of  gun and magazine or firo oontrol crews or introducetion of untrainod men -  which would interfere with rapidity or accuracyof firo for which tho Navy has  been training and upon which so muchthought, time  and money  has boon spent,and upon which success ordisaster depends0       I regret * and my colleagues regret, that the rooent discussionsat the War  Cabinet should have  followed the lines they did. Were it inany way possible  to assist the  Army with men, the Navy would be readyanxious pnd proud to  do  Ita Tho Navy has during the past throe yearsgiven all the Iforinos it oan spare to serve on land and 1  :.ow endeavour-ling in every my  to find a few  more to assist the Army    this juncture,fThe enemy has already,. since the openirg of the offensive on iandtmadc^otormined  efforts to interfere with the pas sago of reinf eroemonts and tores to France  and  it  is only due to the vigilanoe and prompt action -f tho Navy that  practically certain heavy losses have not already courrod,   This  statement  is a  matter of fact - not conjecture,        fchould the War  Cabinet desire to discuss the matter further.,  hope that notice will  be given so that the appropriate representatives f the Admiralty may  atUonda        I  should, in other circumstances than those existing to-day,  W-Qomo any consultation with the  0-in-0,Grand Fleet,but I am entirely   the opinion, on the advi.o of my Naval colleagues,  that  j   should  net   asked to leave  tho  Fleet at  tho present  time,,March 19184(sd)   ERIC GEDDES,
