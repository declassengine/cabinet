CD/384.                                                           /// 5.8.18,                                                          ll               COMMITTEE OB THE TRADE RELATIONS OfMG.             THE UfflTliP KINGDOM WITHIN THE      ***\ft ft IIFirst Report on Raw Materials.Sl;;    The Committee desire to report seriatim on those raw materials  which are wholly or mainly produced within the Empire.  They are  of the opinion that no general scheme of control can be drafted  on a priori principles.   Each commodity should be separately  considered with reference to two questions:       &quot;(a)   Whether any control is desirable, and if so        (b)   What is the most expedient method of control              in the particular case.       When the detailed enquiries are concluded, it will be advis-  able to review as a whole the recommendations which have been made  as to each commodity.if2.    The objects of control are;*-        4a) to secure for the British Empire and the belligerent            Allies a sufficiency of essential raw materials, in            order to enable them to repair the effects of the           &apos; war as soon as possible, and to safeguard their            industrial requirements.        (b) To exert pressure on enemy powers, so as to induce            them to conclude an early peace for fear of economic            ruin after the war.        (c) As a result of such pressure to strengthen bur hands,            and those of our Allies, in conducting the negotiations            at the Peace Conference.S3.    To accomplish these objects some measure of IntersAllied co-  operation will no doubt be essential.  It is probable that any  proposals for direct &quot;control of raw materials by any Inter-AU* ied  body would be impracticable; but the machinery of control should  be such as to be suitable for negotiation and co-operation witlj our  Allies.  This machinery should be created at the earliest possible  moment in consultation with the Dominions and India.$4.    Steps should next be taken to consult with our belligerent  Allies, .and particularly with the United States of America;^
       (a)  as  to  their  requirements  of  Empire raw materials;       (b)  as  to  the  reciprocal  assistance  which they can           give us in resoect  of commodities  over which           they exercise the main control;       (c)  as  to  the  use which can be made  of our and           their  control over  raw materials in  exerting  pres-           sure on the  enemy powers and subsequently in           negotiating-  with them at a Peace Conference.5.    The principle should be  maintained that the Empire, in all bargaining as to raw materials  should  act  as a  unit.6.    !Dhe Committee are aware  that other committees are  dealing T/ith the question of raw materials under certain aspects.   But they believe that the  main facts as to many of the raw  materials produced within&apos; the  Empire are already collected;   and  they propose to deal  first  with certain raw materials concerning which the information  is already accessible in the Colonial Office.      The Committee understand that the domestic problem of distributing the raw materials which H.M.  Government may acquire for United Kingdom use is under consideration  of the Ministry  of Reconstruction.   They do&apos;not  therefore propose at  this  stage to offer any suggestions on this subjects      The Committee are not aware whether any definite and comprehensive organisation has  yet been created for ascertaining the resources and the  needs of our Allies  in respect of raw materials.  They suggest that the Foreign  Office should be asked for information  on this points  But  they consider that the provision for British Empire requirements  should not be delayed while the wants of the  Allies  are  being ascertained.
