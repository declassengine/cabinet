North of the Searpo the 56th Division  claim   to  have  defeated 2f German divisions and to have maintained their  positions  intact..       West of lionchy our troops after heavy fighting wore forced back  a short distance, but in  no case  lias  the battlo-zone been seriously compromised.

The  situation on the whole  of the  above front is satisfactory*   No further  attacks are reported this morning * &apos; South of the Somme.   The enemy has  made some progress  south  of the Somme and the situation ho re causes  anxiety,  no French troops having hitherto made their appearance  in any number.  The  line now  runs west of HAMEL   iiARGELCAVE - CAYEUX  - QUESNEL thence to  GRATIBUS. The positions immediately south of the river aro  held  by a  mixture of units belonging to the 19th Corps reinforced by Labour units.

No change is reported in the French  line,  which appears  to  be  as reported yesterday evening.
