With the exception of disputes on thesubject  of the 12^ per cent, advance among tramway and municipal  employees incertain places there are no serious  disputes.                            I. GENERAL REMARKS.The Miners&apos; Ballot.    The meeting of the Conference of the Miners&quot; Federation of Great Britain washeld as arranged on the 22nd, the Prime Minister having received a deputation fromthe Executive  Committee on  the previous day.   The profound effect of  the  PrimeMinisters  statement  was  evident in  the Resolution  passed by the Conference,wnich  unanimously  agreed  that  the  men  should  be  advised  not   to  resistthe taking  of 50,000 men  from the mines  for the army.    Presumably theballot in favour of assisting the Government in the comb-out  will now result inarrangements being made to this end.    Enquiries have been made in various directions with the object of eliciting thereasons.which  resulted in the  adverse ballot on the main question, and as  a result ofthese enquiries there  seems little doubt that several causes were at work.  In thefirst place in South Wales, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and  in  Scotland there isevidence of widespread and intense pacifist  propaganda, which  doubtless had theresult of ensuring that the pacifists polled the full;strength of their vote.   In SouthWales three notable propagandists. Mr.  Noah Abblet, Mr.&quot; Winstone, and Mr. Barker,were most prominent,  while in Lanarkshire  the deportee,  Mr. John McLean,  andMr. McDougall were assisted by a vigorous campaign on the  part of the Women&apos;sPeace Crusade, of which Mrs. Crawford  is probably  the  most noted and  activemember.      [1100-22]                                                     B
     Secondly, it seems probable that the decertification of certain miners before thecompletion of the ballot was resented, and the resentment found expression in votingagainst the Government on the question  at issue.   In the third place  it  is  alsoprobable that the question of the dilutees had something to do with the result,, Thereis in many  quarters a strong feeling, similar to that which prevails among themembers of the A.S.E., that the first people to go  should be  those who since 1914have joined the union, many of them with  the express object  of escaping that  con-scription which would otherwise have been  their lot.     These three reasons appear sufficiently to explain the adverse vote.  The dis-cussion though  interesting is, however, now of minor importance, as there  is littledoubt that the grave condition of affairs in France will result in  stimulating thepatriotism of the miners, and there seems no chance that anv opposition to the comb-out will now be offered hj them.The A.S.E.     On Thursday last, the 21st March, a  meeting, which purported to consist ofdelegates of this society from the whole of the United Kingdom and which was heldin Manchester, passed resolutions which appeared in full in the daily press.  Theseprotested  against the  Man-Power Bill and informed  the Government, that theengineers wwld cease work on the 6th April, as  a  protest against  the  skilled  menbeing taken  into the army, whilst dilutees liable and fit  for  military service wereretained in the  workshops.   It was also resolved that the resolution should be  sentto all District Committees, with the request that it should be submitted to an aggregatemeeting of members at the earliest possible moment,  and the result communicatednot later than the 3rd April, and that representatives of all districts should attenda further  conference for the 4th April &quot; to finally notify all districts whether or notto cease work in accordance  with the result of the  voting received.&quot;;     The meeting and  its result have been advertised in the public  press on a scalewhich  appears  to be out of proportion to their  importance.   It is true that theofficial presiding at the meeting was Mr. Ryder,  who is the  local chairman of theA.S.E.  The delegates, however,  appear  to have consisted simply  of the irrecon-cilable minority from the London  Conference of the  A.S.E., together with a  numberof Manchester shop stewards, whose attitude towards the Government on all questionsis notoriously hostile.   The meeting was in no sense an official meeting of the A.S.E..and though it is believed that certain members of the Executive of the Society werecognisant of  its proceedings, there can be little doubt that those proceedings werein effect of the nature of a revolt against the constituted authority of the Society.     The statement by Mr. Robert Young.  General  Secretary of the Society, reportedin to-day&apos;s &quot; Times&quot; (26th March) shows that the  Executive  realise the danger tothe Society which may result from this unconstitutional action, but they are  a weakbody and  cannot be trusted to give a  strong  lead,  although  they have  a greatopportunity of reasserting their authority over the rebel element, of whom they havebeen afraid hitherto.  In view of the conditions of the present  week little sympathywill be found.xto exist in any quarter for the small bodv of disgruntled delegates ancitheir adherents  who perpetrated  the Manchester resolutions. &quot;No strike is likely tooccur, but  if there were stoppages, the public and the other trade unions wouldstrongly resent them at such a crisis.                             II. PRESS COMMENTS.Foreign A fairs : Japan and Russia,     There is  some sign of abatement in the interest in Japanese intervention inSiberia which has been displayed  of late by the Labour and Socialist Press.   The&apos;: Labour Leader,&quot; however, devotes  considerable space to the subject, and  seizesupon President Wilson&apos;s  &quot; sympathetic  message to the Russian Soviet &quot;  as  &quot; anindication that  America is opposed to the contemplated invasion.&quot;   Mr. RamsayMacdonald,  both in &quot; Forward &quot; and  in the &quot; Leicester Pioneer,&quot; is more moderate.In his opinion,  the whole  question depends on whether  the  Russian Governmentagrees; and  while he is satisfied with the tone of Mr. Balfour&apos;s statement, he thinksthat, as usual, the Foreign Office is &quot; backing the wrong horse.&quot;  The &quot; Nation &quot; is
 also slightly more satisfied, and attributes the improvement in the position to Presi- dent Wilson  -  The South Wales &quot; Pioneer &quot; is less accommodating, blaming Mr. Balfours anti-democratic policy, and &quot; Common  Sense &quot; prints an  account of an interview with Mr. Crisp, whose view is hostile to intervention.  The only paper which  gives  its support to that policy is the &quot; British Citizen.&quot;&apos;  which is now apparently quite satisfied. Holland.     The question of the Dutch ships attracts some attention.   The comment varies from the extremes of disapproval shown by the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; which heads its article &quot;  Hacking our Way Through,&quot; and the ;; Herald,&quot; which  talks of  adherence to &quot; the  pure Prussian doctrine of military necessity,&quot; to warm welcome  by the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; which says that &quot; in taking over Dutch shipping the Allies have illustrated the practical working of the League of Nations.&quot; War Aims.     The  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; attacks the Prime  Ministers  City  Temple  speech, &quot;which completely destroys whatever reasonable  value might have been attached to the speech he delivered in January.&quot;  &quot; Forward &quot; and the &quot; Bradford  Pioneer &quot; also express dissatisfaction with this speech, the latter complaining that  it gives a completely false account of the German reply to the Pope&apos;s peace offer.  *&apos; Justice &quot; devotes its leading article to an examination of the reception accorded to the Inter- Allied Socialist war aims in Germany, and proves to its own satisfaction that Social Democracy in Germany is powerless.     Some attention is devoted to Count Hertling&apos;s recent speech, in  which quite justly thinks the &quot; Herald &quot; he accuses the Entente of  &quot; hypocrisy.&quot;   The same paper contains a curious article by Mr. Brailsford, in which he admits that we might have a  favourable peace in the West by giving a free hand to Germany in Russia. but asserts that this &quot; means the  defeat and negation of  every ideal  which  disin- terested minds have conceived during this war.&quot;   He finished, however, with a some- what weak plea for peace  negotiations. Food.     Most notable under this head is an exceedingly vigorous defence of State control which appears in the&quot; Clarion.&quot;   It points out the shortness of  the period during which the Ministry of Food has been at work, how the difficulties have during that time rapidly increased, and proceeds to claim for the Ministry and the  Allied Wheat Commission a very considerable degree of success.   Some of the other papers are less favourable, but on the whole the subject does  not attract very much attention. Shipbuilding.     The  :: Leicester Pioneer &quot; attacks Mr. Barnes for his speech on  labour in the shipj^ards, but admits that there was much  truth in what he said.    &quot; Forward &quot; thinks that the   jacks in office are  solely responsible for all the muddle.&quot;   The &quot; New Statesman,&apos;&apos; however, has come round to the view that ;i there was much truth in Sir Eric Geddes&apos; charge that the situation was not realised sufficiently by the employers and men.&quot;   It thinks, however, that the real cause of the small output is undoubtedly &quot; the rival claim of naval shipbuilding.&quot;    The  &quot;  British  Citizen &quot; welcomes  Lord Pirrie&apos;s advent, but on the whole comment  is unimportant. Man-Power.     This  subject receives surprisingly little attention.  t: Justice &quot; prints a reason- able appeal to &quot; young engineers &quot; from &quot; An Old Engineer,&quot; but the &quot; He: aid &quot; does not think that the second ballot will reverse the first.   The result of the miners&apos; ballot appears to have been  received too late for comment, as it is not dealt with.Mvnitions Expenditure.     In  the report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure even the moremoderate  writers find justification for the claim that this is a  &quot; capitalist war.&quot;
Education.     The progress of the Education Bill has called forth comment, mostly favourable,for some weeks past.   This week the majority of the papers refer to the subject, butthe opinions expressed are  somewhat  divided.   The bourgeois papers, such as the&apos;*&apos; New Statesman &quot; and the if Nation,&quot;&apos;  welcome the Bill as an instalment, though the  New Witness &quot; is still hostile, on the grounds  that it is simply being fitted into acapitalist scheme.    Most enthusiastic are the &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; and the &quot; BritishCitizen.&quot;  The former regards the Bill as a great victory,  one  of the triumphs ofpeace over war. and the latter thinks that &quot; in its  scope and importance it is a greatermeasure of reform and progress than the Franchise Act,&quot;   The &quot; Call &quot; is perhapsmost dissatisfied, and  expresses the opinion that the Bill does practically  nothing&apos;.  Justice &quot; expresses more moderate disapproval, but is determined to make sure ofwhat is offered.Housing.     This subject has attracted a considerable degree of attention during  the pastweek.   The &quot; New Statesman &quot; attacks the Treasury and Local Government Boardfor mining the plans of the  Ministry of Reconstruction.   The &quot; Leeds Citizen,&quot; onthe other hand, blames t: the selfish opposition of landlordism &quot; to the Local Govern-ment Board.   The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times  &quot;  deals with  the local problem  inYorkshire.The Second Whitley Report.    For the most part this report is printed without comment, though the  &quot; LabourLeader &quot; promises to deal with it later.   The  &quot; Herald,&quot;  however, expresses anopinion which is again somewhat dubious.   It approves  very much of the proposalto extend the  Trade Boards, but does  not think the partially organised  industriessufficiently strong for the system proposed.                            III. DISTRICT REPORTS.London and South-Eastern.    Unrest, of a somewhat trivial nature, is again evident in this district, and thishas taken effect in  a number of small  and unimportant strikes.  In two cases dis-content has been due to questions arising out of the 12^ per cent, bonus.    The Woolwich and Plum stead branches of  the  National  Union of Clerks areagain  making  great  efforts to amalgamate  with  the War Department Writers&apos;Association, -as it is thought that the position of  both might  be greatly improved bysuch a fusion of forces.West  Midlands.    The situation in this  area  seems on the whole to be quiet.  Some discontent isevident at the Triumph Works, Coventry, where  certain members  of  the Amal-o-amated Society of Engineers are complaining of the price which they are beingpaid for their work, and are also demanding less overtime work.    Again, at the Hotchkiss Works, unrest has arisen over the case of the well-known shop steward. Dinglev. which is dealt with in Part IV of this report,&apos;! Forward &quot; has an intensely bitter article, in which it suggests that the names &quot; ofthese patriotic exploiters &quot; should be printed, and concludes by warning the workersthat &quot; they have got  to  fight more than  the Central Powers.&quot;    The &quot; YorkshireFactory Times &quot;  thinks  that  the  statement  &quot; makes  one blush  for the allegedpatriotism of the people concerned,&quot; and wonders &quot;what would have happened if theSocialists  had been in power in place of the business men.&quot;&apos;   The &quot; Co-operativeATews &quot; does not know whether most to condemn the profiteers or the Ministry, andthe &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; is equally bitter.   The &quot; South Wales Pioneer &quot; reprintswith approval a damning indictment of the Priority Department from the &quot; NationalNews &quot;
     At Birmingham the trouble arising out of claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus.which, have been put forward by Tramway and Corporation employees, has continued.     The I.L.P. still appear to be active in this  district, and are endeavouring tosecure further recruits.  Mrs. Philip Snowden was the speaker at a meeting on the17th, at  which she explained the objects of the I.L.P., and spoke from the usuallines.Yorkshire and East Midlands.     The situation in  this area shows  no improvement, and considerable unrest isagain reported.   As regards  the  Man-Power  Bill, discontent is again evident atSheffield, where some men of the Electrical Trades Union are claiming to be exemptas skilled men.  This claim is the subject of arbitration before a munitions tribunal,and the members of the E.T.U. employed at Messrs. Vickers have now threatened tostrike should any of their fellows be taken for military service pending the result ofthis arbitration.     The members of the A.S.E. are returning all calling up notices as cancelled untilan agreement with the Government has been reached.     In the woollen industry the  situation is still  unsettled.  A conference has beenheld at  Bradford  to consider  the applications which have been put forward foradvances in  wages by  the National  Association of Unions, but no decision wasreached.  A further conference is to be held shortly.     The National Association of Unions in the  textile trade has approved a schemefor  the  constitution  of an industrial council, and  this is to be submitted to theemployers&apos; associations for consideration.    A meeting in aid of the Women&apos;s  Peace Crusade was held at Bradford on the17th, which  was  apparently well  attended, while the speakers were on the wholemoderate in tone.   A rival meeting  at which the speaker adopted an opposite pointof viewr, and spoke upon &quot; Our all-conquering army,&quot; was apparently attended by alarge and enthusiastic audience.North-Western.     The reinstatement of Murphy  has relieved the extreme discontent  which wasaroused by his alleged victimisation.     In other respects, there is, however, unrest throughout the area.     As  regards  the  man-power  situation, an important National Conference ofEngineers was held in Manchester on the 21st.  The proceedings  are described anddiscussed in Part  I of this report.    At Barrow again  it  is reported that considerable labour unrest exists.Northern.     The position in this area is, on the  whole, quiet.     To  the question of  man-power, the opposition seems less  than  in other areas.Thus, both the Durham and Northumberland miners voted in favour of the  Govern-memVs proposals.   Again, at a meeting of the A.S.E. in Newcastle on the 16th, thespeaker strongly advised members to support the Government, on the ground that bysuch action they would Avin support  from the Government after the war on the ques-tion  of unskilled  labour.  At&apos;Messrs. Armstrong, Whitworth&apos;s works,  at Elswick,however,  some friction has  been caused by the employment of Irishmen of militaryage to replace the men called up.South Wales.     The situation in this area is, on the whole, comparatively quiet.     The  suggestion of the 12^ per cent, advance is still causing unrest among rail-waymen  at  Cardiff, and it  is  feared that   this  may lead to  somewhat seriousdevelopments.     In connection with the question of  the  comb-out, a small strike occurred at twopits  in Glamorganshire owing  to the management having served notices upon fourof the miners.  It was hoped, however, that work would be resumed on the 25th.      [1100-22]                                                     G
Scotland.     There appears  to be  little unrest in this district,  and the somewhat scantyreports point  to a favourable situation.  The remarkable improvement which hasundoubtedly occurred on the Clyde during the past two months has been attributedlocally to the Bolshevik failure to stay the German  advance.     Much discontent, however, still exists on the Clyde, owing to the shutting of thepublic houses from Friday to Monday.                                IV. DISPUTES.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    Owing to the fact that this report has to go  to the press a day earlier than isusual it has been  impossible to  obtain  very  full information  from  the  variousDepartments concerned.    The general situation seems on the whole comparatively quiet and more satis-factory than last week.  The number of  strikes reported is not large, though someof these are of considerable importance.    The Shipyard Labour Department reports only  three new stoppages of  work;there  are  also twenty  cases standing over from previous weeks.   In twenty casesout of this total, work  has already been resumed.  Only 129 men have been involved,a number  much below the average for the past few months.    The strikes mentioned were also of short duration.    A partial resumption of work was attained during the w^eek at Messrs. DennyBrothers,  Dumbarton, and it was anticipated that all the men would resume on the25th.    Negotiations are proceeding at  Messrs.  Harland  and Wolff and Messrs.Workman, Clark,  Belfast, where 2,000 joiners were recently on strike.    The War Office Contracts has twojtew stoppages of work to report, one of whichhas been  previously mentioned.    A  strike of carpenters has occurred at Messrs.Wiaring and Gillow&apos;s owdng to an application for the 12^ per cent.  The work uponwhich the men are engaged is urgently required,  and in consequence the firm havedecided to concede their demands.  The men engaged on road making in the factorygrounds have also  struck in sympathy.    At Liverpool  a strike of boilermen  engaged in connection with the productionof sugar has occurred.  This w-as due to the fact that the awrard by wrhich the  122,per cent,  advance  was  conceded to them  w/as not  made retrospective from the 13thOctober.    The Coal Controller reports twrelve new cases of  stoppage of work, but in eightof these cases work has already been resumed.  In three out of the four cases to whichreference  has previously  been made the  men have  also returned to work.   Thenumber of men involved has been somewhat high, being as many as 12.000 approxi-mately.    In Lanarkshire five  new stoppages have occurred, in two of which resumptionshave  since taken place.  The immediate causes of these seem to  have  been trivial,but it is believed that  the real reason for discontent and unrest must be sought inthe recent decertification order.   In  one  instance a stoppage of one day took placewith  the  definite  object  of  discussing this queston.   Several short stoppages havealso occurred  in South Wales, and one in Derbyshire.  One somewhat trivial strikecontinues  in the Yorkshire district.    An important strike occurred in the Bristol area  where 1,500  men at  theChippening Explosives Works went on strike with regard to the transfer of a fore-man.   It  now appears that the men are  endeavouring to extend the  strike to otherfirms.    Another  important  strike  has occurred at three works of the National ShellFactory at  Leeds, which involves about  2,800 men  and women.    Five men weredismissed on  the 20th from the Newlay  Works on account of a  refusal to  do somework which, they alleged, was  dangerous.  Hence the workers struck in sympathy.This  action is due to  the Shop Stewards Committee and is not approved by theAmalgamated Society  of Engineers officials, wdio believe that the motive underlyingthe present action is opposition to the Man Power Bill. .  It is thought, however, that  jthe Shop  Stewards Committee will endeavour to bring out other firms in sympathy.     At Coventry about 600 employees of the Hotchkiss Works came out on the 21st
 as a protest against  the dismissal  of  certain workers,  amongst whom  is the well- known shop steward, T. Dingley.  This man alleges that he is being victimised, and: is trying to arrange a protest meeting in Coventry.     The aircraft woodworkers at Leeds resumed work  on the 22nd  after the issue of their award.  The coke-oven men  who  were  on  strike in Yorkshire have  now returned to work after a conference held at the Ministry of Labour.     The tram workers at Bradford have also resumed  work, but  the dispute with the Doncaster Corporation  workers is not yet settled.     No  report has been received from tjhe Ministry of Munitions this week. (b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.     The Shipyard Labour Department have 58 new controversial cases to report, and 129 old; of this total 60 have already been settled. The number of new  cases stands decidedly higher than during the  past few weeks.   The largest number of cases comes as usual from Liverpool and Glasgow, but these seem on the whole to be of an unimportant nature.     The boilermakers in the London area have voted 16 to 1 in favour  of stopping piece-work; the Executive have, however, decided  that piece-work is to continue, and the price list is to be arranged.     The War Office Contracts Department has only one new case of dispute to report and two which have been previously mentioned.     The former is due to an application for the 12^ per  cent,  by the  workmen of Messrs.  Whitecross  Company, Limited, Warrington, who are  engaged  on wire- drawing.  A sltrike was thought to be imminent owing to the firm&apos;s refusal to agree to arbitration.  The matter  was, however, subsequently taken up by the  Ministry of Labour  with the Ministry of Munitions,  and sanction for payment  of  the increase has been granted to the firm.     The men at the Elswick Leather Works, who  put in an application for increases of wages varying from %\d. to Is. an hour,  are apparently on the point of striking. Investigations are being made into the matter.     Further particulars of the  application   which is  being  put  forward  by the United  Garment Workers are now known.   The  demands seem to vary from  4^r/. to \\d. an hour, and are based upon the increased price of foodstuffs.     Negotiations regarding the applications for inclusion in the  124r per cent, on which the Birmingham tramwaymen were  threatening  to  strike have been  pro- ceeding, and it is to be regretted  that the Corporation have conceded the claims of the men, both in the amount of the bonus and  the backdating of payment  to the  15th December.  Tramway workers in Dublin  are also threatening to come out.  and this class appears generally to be in a state of unrest.     The Committee on Production have heard during the week 38  arbitration cases. and in addition, sitting as the  Special Arbitration  Tribunal, they have heard one case in  connection  with the 12i per cent, award.     The National Federation of General Workers claimed an advance  of wages to be paid to all members engaged on gas undertakings.  The N.U.E., the Craft  Unions, and Workers&apos;  Union are  applying  on behalf of artisans and  their labourers for the 12^ per cent, and 1\ per cent.     176 differences have been reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner during the week, of which 69 are Claims for the 12-1 Per ceri-t-   Of the total, 68 fall in the engineering trade group.  The most important of the cases  heard was an application for the  extension of an award relating to the 12^ per cent, bonus  and the building trade to all operatives engaged on munitions work .
