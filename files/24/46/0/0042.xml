London, S,^, 1.          26th March, 1918.Dear Sir Maurice Hsnkoy,          I enclose a Memorandum stating the present position withregard to Italian coal with special reference to the communicationreceived yesterday to the effect that the supply of French  coal mustbe diminished by 2,000 tons a day in consequence of the movement oftroops.          It will be seen that arrangements to secure Italy1?? 600,000tons in the month had been fully made but for the supply of Frenchcoal falling short.          The difficulty in stating the position now is to know justhow much French coal can safely be relied upon in viow of the movementof troops.  If Franco could really send the full amount originally.arranged minus only a reduction of 2,000 tons a day, this could befully met by diversions of Mediterranean colliers.   On the whole,however, it seems unsafe to rely upon more than about half of thequ-natity of French coal going during the month,  say, 170,000 tons in-stead of 350,000          To deal with the situation the following arrangement isproposed:-          150,000 tons by long sea route          100,000  &quot;      Blaye          170,000  ,T   of French coal by rail                  and short sea route420,000100,000 tons by diversion of British Mediterranean coal 50,000 tons now being attempted in other ways with        American assistance.arranged   TTassumed as stillpossible.          580,000 tons.          As 410,000 of this total would be British coal this wouldbe more than equivalent to the contemplated 600,000 tons of which350,000 would have been French coal.          This programme is very provisional and  is subject to thereservations made in the enclosed memorandum.  It may prove impossibleto carry it out fully.                       Yours faithfully,(Signed)   J.P0Maelay.

Urgent represonta-tions were made to the FrenchGovernment on the subject,  Francehas so far only nominated 4,400tons d,w.
6)   In consideration of the   supply of 35O.0OO tons  of   French coal,  the  Allies were   to  ship 350,000 tons of   British coal  to France  (mainly   to  Dunkirk and Rouen) during   about  the 6 weeks March 15th   to  April 30th; an adjustment   being  made if France did.  not   send 350,000  tons of coal   equivalent in calorific value   to  the British coal.  Great   Britain indicated she could   send 150,000  tons of this in   small  vessels and the Allies   were to co-operate for  the;   remainder.(1)  Great Britain has allocated     small tonnage capable of     carrying about 230,000 tons     to  France.(2)  Diversions  from French     general trade to coal trade     will it is  estimated give     a further 30,000 tons of     coal.(3)  Various small neutral vessel     provided by Great Britain &amp;     America &amp; 1 American vessel     provide 11,000 tons*(4)  France arranged diversions     of large tonnage capable of     carrying 60,000 tons.(5)  The small balance of less     than 20,000 tons to complete     the 350,000 tons would have     been provided if necessary     by allocation of British     Atlantic liners.      It is clear that Great Britain had fully carried out herpart of the general arrangement having      (a) with Italy provided for the full 150,000 tons by long          sea route      (b) with Italy provided for the full 100,000  &quot; to Blaye      (c) arranged to provide l/3rd (60,000 tons) of the tonnage          required for the conveyance of the 180,000 tons from          South France by short see route.      (d) provided small tonnage for about 270,000 tons (instead of          150,000 tons) replacement to Francec      So far as the plan hag. already failed it is on the side ofthe provision of French coal.t i&apos;  Modification in situat ion in ooiiseouence of notice on Ma re h     25&apos;th that while &quot;the troop  movsinc nt from &quot;Italy lasTs, if &quot;will     inevitably involve a reduction of k000 &quot;tons a day in the     despatch of French coal.      It is difficult to know exactly how much would be allowed onthis ground.      Assuming the movement takes a fortnight this would meanmaking an emergency provision of an extra 30,000 tons by the longsea route if the reduction of 2,000 tons a day only meant areduction of 2,000 tons from the full programme as arranged by theTransport Council,      This, as an emergency measure, could be provided by diversionof British colliers en route to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean(Atlantic liners bein^ diverted to Gibraltar to maintain bunkersupplies there) end action has been taken accordingly-      We have unfortunately, however, to face the certainty, asshewn bv the figures in Pert I. thai the deficiency will in factbe much greater.  If the 2,000 tons a day reduction for two weeksis regarded as a reduction, not from the full programme of 15,000tons a day by rail and short sea route, but from the actual ratemaintained during the first few days of the month (10,000 tons aday as shewn above), the dificit for the month would be not-2-
 30,000 tons but about 180,000 tons.   It must, however, be remembered^. that (a) 11.500 tons a day out of the 15,000 tons would hare been French seal and that (b) apart from the dislocation through troop movement&apos; the daily rate might fairly have been expected to improve, as the 4 days 15 - 18 March (immediately following the Transport Council arrangement on 14th March) can hardly reflect the special arrangements which M-Glaveille promised to make to increase railway facilities and shipping facilities at the South French ports.          In all the circumstances it would seem to be necessary to increase the long sea shipment,  not by 30,000 tons, but by at least 100,000 tons to compensate for dislocation on the railways,  In addition the actual troop movement will mean oxtra consumption of coal It would therefore appear important than an extra 160,000 tons should if possible go by the long sea route.          As an emergency measure it would be possible for Great Britain to divert 100.000 tons of colliers destined for Gibraltar and the  Mediterranean with partial replacement by the allocation of the 60,000 tons of French Atlantic liners and of British liners to Gibralt these vessels being of course not required to take replacement coal, to France as5 with the smaller supply of French coal to Italy, the small vessels will more than suffice for replacement.   It must of course be realised that the larger diversion of Atlantic vessels (as compared with proposed short diversion to K-,French ports) will mean a much larger loss in Atlantic Imports.          The American representatives are, it is understood, communi- cating with Washington with a view to seeing whether some American vessels now in French ports can help as regards the balance.          The situation is  being very carefully watched and everypossible measure of giving  further relief investigated.3?oS*      Since the above memorandum was written, the French coalrepresentatives in London have stated that they were informed fromParis late last evening that the French Authorities consider that theycan still carry out the full programme of 15,000 tons a day, minus a  ^reduction of only 2,500 tons a day while the troop movement lastsuIf this could  be taken as certain it would only mean ( for say afortnight move) a deficit of somo 40,000 tons on the original programmeIt is,  however, perhaps safer to take for the moment the less optimist!view presented above.
