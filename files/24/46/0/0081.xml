Section I (2)     The provision  Cor ministers of religion               and for conscientious objectors should be               separate.                  It was agreed that tho words &quot;in connection               with tho service of the sick end wounded&quot;               unduly restricted tho field of non-combatant               duty which it was desirable to prescribe to               ministers of religion and various additions to               follow tho words &quot;sick and voundod&quot; were               suggested, such ss:-                  &quot;or other non-combatant service&quot;:                  &quot;or other&quot;non-combatant duty which may                   from time to time be assigned to him:&quot;                  &quot;within the limits proscribed by tho Geneva                   Convention.&quot;                  The draughtsman was requested to insert               some words which would enlarge the sense               along the lines indicated.Section 2(1)     MB. R03DBT3 stated that he and his labour               colleagues in the Government were strongly               opposed to lowering the age of military               service to 17 and wore hardly less strongly               o;;nosed to the recruiting of boys of 17               compulsorily for the Volunteer Pore3.  He               agreed that the msttor was one of policy for               the W&amp;r Cabinet rather than for this Committee.                  IBS COmtlTTEE agreed to omit the reference               to 8- ea 51 to 56 and to make the sub-section               read:-                  &quot;Subjeet to the provisions oi? this Section,                   every male British subject for the time                   being in the United Kingdom (Great Britain)                   who has attained the age of seventeen                   years but has not attained the age of                   eighteen years shall be liable to perform                   such service in the Volunteer force as may                   be prescribed.,&quot;                                                             *                  It was agreed, more especially in view               of rural co editions, to be undesirable to               compel all members of the ago  Group 51 -               56 to join the Volunteer Force, but that the               Bill should give power to the Minister cf               National Service to impose conditions by               regulations on postponed men.  This provision               might appear in the next Section as 3 (1) (f).Section 3d)     KiH. JvIUIJBO, iiR. hOBEETS, and PiU HAYES               FlhKSB were united in opposing the removal               tho present machinery of tribunals, though               willing to see the machinery modified end               improved in various directions.
   In Scotland, Mr. Munro maintained, thepresent system had conclusively demonstratedits great value and noar commanded generalconfidence.  Its operations could no doubtbe expedited, but to scrap it would be apiece of parliamentary vandalism.  In Englandthe area of the appeal court was the county,but in Scotland it was the sheriffdom whichsometimes averred several counties.  There wasa paid chairman, viz. the Sheriff, who was aresponsible public official and it was certainthat the tribunals in Scotland would not standhaving their decisions overridden by officersof the Ministry of National Service.  Heparticularly wished to know whether the powersof the new authorities were to be advisory orjudicial.   MB. HAYES FISHER urged that the House ofCommons would be strongly opposed to handingover the tribunals entirely to the Ministryof National Service, because the Local Govern-ment Board was generally regarded as a bufferbetween the public and the Army authorities.He thought, too, that the House of Commonswould scrutinize most critically the proposalto standardize individual conditions likedomestic or financial hardships?   MR. ROBERTS said that he wa3 willing tocurtail the present procedure by not allowingappeal except with the consent of the tribunal,   SIR A. GEBDES reminded the Committee thathe had been charged by the War Cabinet withthe task of finding   a very large number ofrecruits at a time    grave national emergency.He had to prepare machinery to enable him tomake what was practically a levy en nc.33eand to do this with the least possible damageto the industrial fabric of the country.  Hehad never suggested that the personnel of thetribunals should be dispersed,  but that theyshould be retained as advisory bodies todeal with individual applications on the basisof a definite code of standardised individualconditions.  They would apply certain prescribeed principles to particular cases and withinthose limits they would not be interfered with.They would have no power of exemption,  becauseexemptions wouM be abolished,  but they wouldhave the power of postponing a man from onegroup to another ^roup.  Men will be placedin their groups as a result of their medicalexamination and occupational value.  Theadvisory bodies will have no cognizance of aman*s medical fitness.  A man unfit medicallywould not  receive a calling up notice,  anduntil he received a calling up notice he wouldnot wish to come before the advisory bodiesor tribunals.  So long as tribunals were
allowed to retain powers of exempting menhe did not see how the numbers required bythe War Cabinet were to be obtained.  Onhis plan classified groups would be publishedindicating the occupations,a,*es, and medicalgrades of the men required, and there wouldbe a right of appeal to be postponed to alater group.  The work of the advisory bodiesor tribunals would be confined to the ad-justment of individual cases that came oeforethen, and it was essential that this workshould be done with great speed, as the in-t&amp;ke of the recruiting machine would beenormously increased,  provided the urgencyand magnitude of this task were realised andfully met he had no objection to the responsi-bility for the work remaining with the LocalGovernment &quot;Board.  The tribunals would haveto sit continuously and small panels wouldbe necessary tr deal with accumulations ofwork.  Fith regard to existing certificatesof exemption they would remain valid untilfresh calling up notices were served.  Thegreat majority of exemptions were at presentUnder the Ministry of National Service;considerably less than a million had beenexempted by the tribunals on grounds otherthan those of occupation.SIH A.STANLEY called attention to the positionOf the 700,000 railwaymen who, in view of apledge given by the Government, could onlybe called up by arrangement with the Railwayexecutive.  These railwayman were protectedby individual certificates, and they would beapprehensive lest the present Bill should bedeemed to cancel the Government pledge,   LORD KILHSR stated that in his opinionthe proposed alteration  in the law wouldnot revoke the pledge.THE COMMITTEE were agreed that thepresent tribunal system should be re-tained, but that the duties of thetribunals should be altered so as tocarry out the functions indicatedabove by Sir A. Geddes; the power togrant exemption should be cancelled;the! right of appeal should be modified;and steps should be taken to speed upthe operation of the tribunals.THH. COMMITTEE ad$un*e  until 3 p.m.
