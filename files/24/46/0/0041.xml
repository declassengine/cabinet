Throughout ilarch 25th the enemy delivered attacks ingreat strength on our 3rd Army front between BAZEETIE andBOYELLES, most of which were repulsed with very heavy loss,but In the afternoon the enemy brought up fresh reserveswith whose aid he succeeded in pressing us back to theline ALBERT, EIEAUEOET, BUCOJJOY, BOYELLES.   The enemy1spressure continues on this front.     South of the SOME our 5th Army, which is operatingunder General Fayolle. was attacked between PEEOEEE andNESLE and was pressed back a short distance along this front     It was expected that the enemy would to-day endeavourto press his advantage by a strong attack east and south ofAREAS but up to 10,30 this morning no attack had takenplace in this part of the field.     The Commander-in-Chief states that our troops foughtmagnificently on the 25th against very superior numbers.     We are retiring slowly,contesting every yard of ground,and are receiving increased assistance from the French.Although the enemy has a considerable number of fresh div-isions available in rear of the battie-front, we are rapidlyusing up these reserves, and as the distance from his supplybases increases the weight of the German attack should tendto diminish.Ge:ieral Staff,   Ear Office,     26th harch, 1918.
