Sift  mv-o277HIS TinmiM^^I^THj^OPERTY OF HIS BRIgAMIO MAJSSTYrS  00YERKMSH5)S E 0 R E TaWAR  jg, A B I K S T?COHDITIOI OE IRELABD.Memorandum by the Ohiof Secretary for Ireland.     There has been no recrudescence of open lawlessness oragrarian disorder during the rast week,  Cases of wrongfulentry on land have been few and for the most part unimportant.In Glare the enforced, quiet resulting from military controlcontinues, with the same undercurrent of sullen ill-feelingas before against the troops and constabulary.  The death endfuneral of a young man from a bayonet wound inflicted in thedispersal of a Sins Fein meeting by soldiers have not resultedis any serious demonstration.  From both Hidings of Galwsy,Berth Roscomraon,  and North Kerry chore ere reports of mani-festations of hostile feeling against the police,  limerick;and florth Tipperary also show some restlessness, though notin a marked or apparently serious degree.     Throughout the Southern provinces Sinn Fein organisersstill proceed with work of organisation.  They claim to havein clubs numbering about 1200 between 80,000 ana 90,000members.   The reported existence of a &quot;volunteer&quot; companyin oonnection withySinn Fein Clubs in country districts isthe most troublesome feature of the movement.  Considerableexpense, great pains, and m little labour and ingenuityarje being applied to make these volunteer companiesefficient in their knowledge of simple military movements.There is also a good deal of systematic instruction  of arudimentary kind in minor tactics *  The absence of any largesupply of arms and the impossibility of procuring effectiveweapons are fortunately safeguards against any immediatedanger from these proceedings.  Continuous arrests of leaderswhich have been proceeding now for several weeks are also auseful check,  I should be glad, however, if some suchlegislative step as I have suggested foadsecuring the removalof all the men systematically concerned &apos;in drilling could bebrought into operation soon.     Trials of men charged with agrarian offences and unlawfuldrilling still engage a good deal of public attention.  Hoserious resentment appears yet to be provoked among the massof the people, and as every malcontent avows himself aRepublican when brought before the Resident magistrates thereis apparent justification for putting them under restraint.Attempts to create n w forms of disorder among these men afterthey get to prison have been reported but seem not to be serious.Mr. Grlnnoll, M.P, after being convicted of Incitement to agrarianoffences ref sed food for a day or two, but he appears to havealtered his mind on the subject.
     Two elections now  pending  will give the Constitutionalnationalists opportunities  of repeating their successes  ofSouth Armagh and  i-aterford  City.&apos;  In Best Tyrone where asuccessor to Captain    Arc er  i-:edraond  - the new member  for&quot;,&apos;aterford - is bein^ chosen, I  anticipate that the Sinn  Feincandidate will be bee ten.   In Kings County the polling, for asuccessor to the  late Mr. Graham,  M.?.  an independentnationalist appears likely  to produce a close contest,  ifnothing occurs in the meantime&quot;to  excite strong public feedingMr. Dillon may \vin a seat there.     In anticipation of Ss3ter  week alarmist rumours os  to thesholidays sprung up as they  had  done last year but not so dis-l Itinctly or generally.   r&apos; A  republican rebellion on a fature unlnamed day seems a more  common subject of gossip.  Eastor inDublin gave some  cfeuse  for  apprehension, but at 6 o1 clock onMonday evening the season seems  to havo passed in perfoctquietude and order.                              (Signed)    H.  E.
