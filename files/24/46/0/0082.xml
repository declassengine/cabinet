WARGAB I 1ST.M.-4077tsmpmsim GASPS *     A Conference of Military aspfosontatires of the French.British,  Italian, American and Belgian Governments, accompaniedby Legal  Advisors, act at 3 p8Q. on March 26th, IS 18, at TheTrianon P&amp;laoe, Versailles, to consider what reply it mightbe desirable,  from the military point of view, for thoAllied Sovernmonta to send to the letter addressed to themby tho International Red Cross Bureau in Switzerland withregard to the  use of Asphyxiating Gases,     U9 Bouehan Stophanovitch, Serbian Military Attache in Paris,and M*lh$ovaeovitoh,  Professor of Jurisprudence had been invitedto attgft on behalf of the Sarbiaii Government but were unfortunatelyua&amp;ble to tee present,,       MB HAL SIH E* RAWLIKSOtff the Chairman, pointed out thatthe Conference had met to consider, from the purely militarypoint of view, what recommendation it should make to the AlliedGovernments with regard to the answer to be sent to the letterfrom the International Hod Cross Bureau.-  He gatharod, but was notquite certain, that a similar letter had been addressed to thearae&amp;y ?rwara as well as rShoso of the Entente,  In any ease it wasnot an official communication from the enemy &quot;but had been raisedby the Bed Cross from humanitarian motives.   The Bepreesstativtsof the French and British Governments, whose Armies were mostdirectly concerned and had had the widest experience in the matterof the use of gas in warfare, had already discussed the questionand had agreed upon a draft of the reply which they suggested itwould be desirable to send to the Red Cross.   In that draft theyhad thought well to recite the conditions under which gas hadbeen first employed on the Western Front, and to make clear thatthe Allies generally could not accept conditions wnich would hindtheir actions in future unless they could secure really reliableguarantees that these conditions would also be kept on the otnerside.     CAPTAIN VJBIGBT then read out the draft reply(attached, S,7,G.143).     In answer to a question by GENERAL BLISS it was made clearthat this was a draft reply suggested by the Military Hepresenta-tives, and based on purely military considerations.  It would ofcourse be open to the Governments concerned to modify that replyor adopt a wholly different one.     SIGNOH SICORY pointed out that the draft reply did net go into any specific detail as to what guarantees could he secirrcd,  orwhat were the poisonous gasos whose disuse was to be considered.He suggested that there were ether instruments now being c^clcyedin war, such as flame projectors, which were outside the categoryof. what was permissible in the Hague Conventions.     In answer to this te. FRQMAGEOT pointed out that theoriginal letter from the Bed Cross only dealt with thequestion of gasesV

Rep. for Italy.&apos;Permanent Mil, Rep, of the U*ivlinister for Portugal *     The Governments of the Allied Powerst signatories of theConvention, have received in a spirit of sincerest sympathy thappeal which the Committee of the Red Cross ha3 addressed towith the praiseworthy object of patting an end, if possible, tuse as a means of war of poisonous and asphyxiating gases,     Uore than any, tho Allied Powers associate themselves witgenerous and truly humane ideas which in this as in other caseinspire the Geneva Committee:  they fully share the Committee&apos;sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science,instead of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is dprostituted to the pitiless work of increasing general dostrue     It is only too true, as the Committee says, that those wfcfirst did not hesitste to invent such cawit of war as deadlyassumed a fearful responsibility.  Once sucn methods are intrfldueed by one side, the adversary under pains of self sacrificecannot refrain from having recourse to them and from seeking
to perfect his use cf thorn, in crier to gain and not suffermastery.     At the beginning of the present war, the Allie  Powersbelievea and ha:; tho right to believe with  the whole world,that barbarous methods of refined cruelty In wf.r wore done wi^has between civilised nations.   Explicit and solemn pledges hadbeen y;-*en that no use should ever be mswde  of poison or of arms,projectiles or other moane of war aiming at the infliction ofneedless suffering,   ith the Committee of  the i?ed Cress, thoAllied Powers consider thnt poisonous r-nd asphyxiating gasesare clearly included in this prohibition.     This pledge figured in tho Convention  of which variousGovernments - notably&apos;the Imperial German Government - guaranteedloyal execution.  If any vsiue v*as to be ittached to the word ofhonour of Sovereign states, no conviction seemed better establishedthan that of the Allied Powers that their troops would not besubjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnishedwith any equipment to protect them against  it.     This&apos;was tho situation &quot;;hen in April 1915 the allied forceswere assailed by a new enemy in the shane of deadly gases, firstasphyxiating, then poisonous.   he appalling sufferings causedby this insidious and treacherous attack have boon only tooaccurately described by the Committee.  The  German Empire hadrecourse to methods it h&amp;d expressly undertaken not to use, findhad again broken its word,     for months it became tho duty of the Allied Powers to seekand to discover means of protecting their troops against thesedastardly abominations and to furnish thorn with the power ofresisting their adversaries with equal arms,  rhis t-.sk is nowaccomplished.      In its eloquent appeal the Committee  pleads for an agree-meat to bo undertaken immediately and loyally upheld by theArmies to stop the use of these gases,     Vith any other adversary, h?4 such a question been possible,the jillied powers &apos;.:ould not hesitate to give their agreementwithout reservation,   They r.greed in 1899  *nd in 19u7 and areready to pledge themselves vith any one whoso word is kept.     But in dealing with the Gorman Smpire  and it3 subordinates,what guarantee could the allied powers have that this new agree-ment would be better kept than its predecessors?  Could the newagreement bo more explicit end solemn then  the previous one,cheerfully betrayed by the German  mvoire, as soon as it consideredbe traya1 expo .ient?     In spite of all, if the German Government to-day declaresthat it adheres to the Committee&apos;s proposal and offers detailedand effective guarantees that an agreement  to discontinue therse oi haa r;ill be observed, the Allied Governments will netrefuse to examine its oio -,osals in the most liberal spirit.   Butwithout such guarantees, the allied Governments would fail intheir duty in not having recourse to every moans of deprivingthair opponents of their power to harm.
