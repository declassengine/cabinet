                 (This Document is *hs ^rep^y^&apos; ^                 ut* Rri+annic Wlaiest^s Government.)j*          .AME1OTEHT OP THE MILITARY SERVICE ACTS.\          miORAEDUII BY THE  SECRETARY FOR  SCOTLAND, :         I  quite  recognise  that the  scheme  proposed &quot;by the Ministerv .  of National Service  is  designed,  to  meet  an  emergency.- In these    circumstances the War Cabinet  may well  &quot;be impatient  of merely    negative  criticism or of  arguments  which might, under normal    conditions, prevail.  But  just because  the  scheme is designed    to meet a grave  emergency,  it  demands careful  scrutiny.  Car-    tain  objections  to it are  manifest,  even at  first blush.         (a)   To scrap  existing machinery,  to  discard the esaoroiaulst-    ed knowledge  and experience which Tribunals  have acquired during    three years,  is  obviously  undesirable,  if it can be  avoided.  It    is, indeed, &quot;Swapping horses while  crossing  a  stream&quot;.         (b)   The abolition  of Tribunals would,  create much resent-    ment  among the members  of  these  bodies,  who  have devoted much    skill, time and  energy  to,  as  I  think,  the  satisfactory discharge    of a  difficult and. thankless duty.   As  the Tribunals include    many  of the leaders  of  public  opinion and some of the most    responsible representatives of Labour in the country, this is an    important  factor which  wouH militate against the usefulness of    the Advisory  Committees.         (c)   To deny to the men who are now to be called up the    privilege  of  having their  cases  decided  by a Tribunal of their    fellow citizens  would create a feeling  of unfairness as between    the new recruits and those already  enlisted  in the Army,  The    difference an treatment would be the more striking as the neur    recruits will in great  part consist  of the older men who have    to bear the weightier.responsibilities of life.         (d)   Finally, in this connection,  the  substitution of a   bureaucratic for a democratic system is manifestly-undesirable,    unless indeed it  be unavoidable.        What  then -ire the  objections to the old system?  What    are the advantages of the new?   I apprehend that  the only two    complaints which can be made regarding the  existing  system are    (l)  that the output of men secured by means  of it  is unsatisfac-    tory,  and  (2)&apos;  that the working of the Tribunal system is  dnduly    slow.        As regards the first of these,  I find  no argument  adduced    in the papers  which have been circulated.   It  is  to be  remembored   that  the number of Grade I men noi:? holding  exempt ion..;from Tribunals    is co-nparat ively small owing to the sifting  of oases which ,ha,s    already been effected.        As regards the second, it  does  not  seem to me clear    either that the present  system is unduly dilatory, or that   the  proposed system will be an improvement upon it k   The new   machinery  wj.ll take time to set up.   The decisions ther- to  be   taken  will either have to be taken in the Ministry of national   Service -  involving  inevitable  delay - Or by a  Regional represent   tive  of  the Ministry,  involving diminished authority.  Assuming   however, that  the present  system is  not  wholly  satisfactory, it   surely better  to  improve it rather than  to abandon it - to epeo : :;   up rather  than to destroy it.   Several improvements might be   sug-&apos;Vest eI. For example: -Colonel Jonas
ionlou     (l) &quot;Existing exemptions on occupational grounds might tc-abolished up t o any desired point hy mean5? of a clearer, cutunder section 2 of the Military Service Act, 1910,     (2)   The rirht of appeal &quot;by the man to the Appeal Tribunalmight he limited to cases in which the Local Tribunal consent-;to the appeal.     (3)   There might be en amalgamation of the smallerTribunals and a strengthening of others thereby saving time andincreasing efficiency, and, if necessary, meetings might be worefrecuent.     I suggest that along these lines a suitable and sufficientremedy, assuming it to be required, may be found:   that theabolition of Tribunals at this juncture might be misinterpretedby the public as involving either a grave reflection upon theircapacity or as suggesting panic legislation:  and  that  the Houseof Commons would be more easily persuaded to speed up existingmachinery of proved worth than to destroy it and substitute for ita scheme of speculative value.  There is no doubt  that  if Tribunr-3are informed of the urgency of the need for men they will readil;;;respond to the necessities of the situation.
