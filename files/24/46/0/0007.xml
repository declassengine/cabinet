, LABOUR  POSITION IN  MUNITION  INDUSTRIES.(20th March 1918.)    I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligenceand  Statistics Section of  the Ministry  of Munitions  on  the labour position  inmunition industries.                                               WINSTON  S. CHURCHILL.                                I. -STRIKES.    In these notes for last week 10 strikes were said  to have been reported by chiefinvestigation officers as being in progress on the 14th March.  Since then nine newstrikes have been reported, and 12 strikes have been settled.    Stability in the labour situation cannot be expected.   The sky may be clear oneweek&apos;and the next may see threatening  storm-clouds gather.   In the past week ananxious  situation was suddenly created by the discharge for bad  time-keeping  ofJ. T. Murphy, the shop  steward leader, by the Vulcan Motor  and Engineering Com-pany, Limited, at South/port.   A local strike  followed, and promises of sympatheticaction  came from  Barrow  and Sheffield places  with  reputations as  centres  ofindustrial unrest.   The  intervention of the  Ministry,, however, with  conciliatoryproposals fortunately averted additional complications.   Eventually, Murphy wasreinstated and the men  at Southport, who had come out on the 7th March, resumedwork on  the 20th.    In  the matter of disputes and strikes,  the action  of a  single firm in a minorindustrial centre may suffice  to cloud the  prospects of industrial peace.  Preventivemeasures cannot always and everywhere  be  effectual, but the success  of promptremedial action is  illustrated by the fact  that the only current strikes of over oneweek&apos;s standing are those of  (1) the glassworkers at Gateshead, where less than 100are now  involved, as against 441 a few weeks ago, and (2)  the Leeds aircraft workers,who insist upon remaining out until an award has been made by the Committee onProduction.                    II.-HEALTH OF  T.N.T.  WORKERS.     Very satisfactory results are  being obtained in the campaign of the medicalofficers of the Welfare and Health Section against the toxic effects of work on T.N.T.and other explosives.     In  the nine Government factories engaged  in the manufacture of T.N.T., theregulations of the Ministry of Munitions (published in Eebruary, 1917) do not apply,and cases arising there are referred in the first instance to the medical staff of theHome Office.   The officers of the Ministry of Munitions, however, are responsible  fordealing  with twenty-nine trade factories and ten National filling factories, in whichT.N.T. is handled by the employees.     The reduction  which has been effected in the incidence and fatal effects of toxicjaundice in all the factories is shown in the following table: 	July-Dec 1916. Jim.-Jiine 1917.		July-Dec. 1917.Cases -Deaths - - - -	159 44	139 32	50 12    Post-mortem examinations  carried out  after  the Morecambe  explosion  (1stOctober, 1917) showed that  there was no  trace of gradual liver destruction, whichit had been suspected might be taking place  even in the case of workers who wereapparently healthy.

    Investigations and experiments -are made in advance as to the effects of poisonousnew explosives.         ,&apos;        . . .  &quot;... .       .  .... ..    Preventive medicine is also playing a beneficent part in connection with the newNational factory  now being  erected at Gainsborough for Admiralty work.   In thelight of previous experience, arrangements are being made for farming  to he carriedon by the employees to provide alternation of labour.    The work of  medical  inspection has been facilitated  by the practice of allowingthe medical officer in charge of  T.N.T. factories at the headquarters of the Ministryto act on occasion as locum tenens during the absence of  factory doctors.   It is onlythrough taking a share, in the work of a factory that its difficulties can be appreciatedand remedies suggested.    For  similar reasons a proposal is being  considered toconcentrate T.jST.T. filling in the larger establishments.  III.-WAGES  AND WORKING  CONDITIONS   IN  THE  MUNITION                                   TRADES.    . Ah investigation is being instituted into the standard rates of wages  and otherconditions  of employment  in munition trades  in each district and into the variationsfrom these standards in particular establishments.   The information will not only becollected now but will be kept up to date.    The objects to be secured are : -      (1)  Detailed information as to the remuneration of the more essential  classes       -      of skilled labour with a view to supervising its supply and distribution.       (2)  Precise data as to the effect  of  any  proposed  advances in wages both in             the industry immediately concerned and  in allied  industries  which             might be affected.       (3)  A more economical allocation of contracts.    The investigation is to  include a more systematic inquiry into the time-keepingof the workers in firms which a.re on the Priority &quot; A &quot; list.  Since leaving certificateswere abolished and prosecutions forbad time-keeping were taken over by the Ministry,employers have been less ready to face the risk  of losing their workmen and to  pursuethe formalities necessary for prosecution. IV.-MUNITION  WORKERS AND  THE  FOOD-RATIONING  SCHEME.    Factory managers agree that the rationing system  has worked with  surprisingsmoothness in  munition canteens.  Up  to  the present  output  has not  fallen off.Shopping- difficulties have practically disappeared.   Manual workers  are gratifiedby the prospect of an increased  allowance  of rationed foods.   The Food  Section ofthe Ministry are turning  their attention to organising  the  distribution  of cheese,jam, and cooking oils for canteens hi National factories.    For the present it appears  that in  the area to which the  new system  has  beenapplied, active discontent on the focd question has come to an end.
