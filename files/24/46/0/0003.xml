SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.% WEEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. XXI.DBW/621.(22 March,  1918).    &quot;During the past two months the only Subject of importancein Bulgarian eyes has been the varying progress of peace negotiationbetween Russia and the Central Powers.  The beginnings of thediscussions at Brest-Litovsk on December 22 were haile&apos;d withjubilation by Bulgarian opinion of all parties, and it wasuniversally believed that an arrangement could at once be reachedwith the Russian delegates and that this was but the first stepto a general peace to which the action of Russia would sooncompel the Western Powers.  On December 29 the Bulgarian pressannounced the    conclusion of a separate peace between Russiaand Bulgaria.  It showered congratulations and eulogies on theBolsheviks for their action and indulged in the pleasing reflectionthat Russia would follow up this peace with Bulgaria by anotherpeace of agreement with the Central Powers, between whom $fee RussleBulgaria, as the friend of either party, would in future play animportant role.     Theso hopes were doomed to disappointment.   On January 2Trotski denounced Germany&apos;s &quot;hypocritical peace  proposal&quot;.   Soonafter, on January 14, the Bulgarian authorities  had to explainthrough the press that Radoslavov&apos;s words about  &quot;peace with Russiahaving been concluded&quot; had been &quot;wrongly interpreted&quot;.Bulgarian opinion was promptly brought into line Y/ith the orthodoxfaith promulgated by the Central Powers amongst  their subjects,viz. that the Bolsheviks had approached the peace negotiationsin bad faith and that the Central Empires were justified indisregarding them and treating with other Russian Governments,
- Enthusiasm for the Ukraine was worked up in the Bulgarian press and Eulgarian professors promptly produced in the papers a series of articles showing the historical connection &quot;between the Ukraine and Bulgaria and the warm sympathies which had always united these two peoples.  This new tendency had been well worked up in view of the imminent separate peace between the Ukraine and the centra&quot;. Empires which was ultimately signed at Brest-Litovsk on February 9. For the Bolsheviks nc one had *any longer a good word.  Thus Mr Radoslavov in two interviews in the Vo ssische Zeitang and the Itfeue Freie Pres^se, in which he speaks of the peace with the Ukraine as a prelude to a world peace, praises the Ukrainians as &quot;born organisers and therefore worthy of the sympathy of our alliance&quot;. On the other hand, he declares that even before he went tc Brest- Litovsk he was &quot;firmly convinced that the Bolsheviks did not wish to sign a treaty of peace&quot;.  &quot;Bolshevism is not only a danger for Russia, but also for the whole of Europe and the entire world- We are rendering the world an invaluable service in preserving it from the. danger of Bolshevism.&quot;   And again he goes on hopefully: &quot;The days of the Bolsheviks are numbered.  We.have no interest in checking the growth of anarchy in Russia.  On the contrary, the ancient Russian Colossus becomes ever weaker, and so much the better. \c... The Bolsheviks are the enemies of the Bulgarians&quot;.      In fact Bulgarian Jingoes (i.e. practically the whole Bulgarian nation) are much relieved at the prospect of having to fit their war aims into the strait-jacket of abstract principle proffered by the Bolsheviks.  &quot;No annexations&quot; and &quot;the self-determination tf peoples&quot; are awkward formulae  for those who wish to seize all the stolen property of their neighbours still in their possession.  Radoslavov recently declared:  &quot;Whatever soil the feet of Bulgarian soldiers have trodden will remain Bulgarian&quot;.
 It is  true  that  efforts  are  &quot;being constantly made  by Bulgarian propagandists  to describe  the  desired annexation of  the  Morava Valley,  Dobrogea,  Old Serbia and Greek Macedonia as  the  &quot;liberation and disannexation of  Bulgarian lands&quot;,  and to some of their  methods for propagating  this  fable allusion has already and  will again  be made.    But matters  are  eased  for them by the new  German method of separate peaces with  various elements such as Finland,  the Ukraine, Rumania etc., which enables the Central Powers  to con- clude  profitable bargains  and  keep off the dangerous ground  of general  principles.   The last  instance of this is  the peace  with Rumania, with  whom the preliminary treaty (to be ratified by March  22) was  signed  $n  March  5 at midnight.  Bulgarians will at least  enjoy the  satisfaction of seeing a peace imposed on their hated  neighbour  which delivers her over, bound hand  and  foot, to her enemieso   As regards particular Bulgarian aspirations satisfaction will be  expressed that Dobrogea is to be lost by Rumania, for there had been  grave doubts expressed lest  Germany, to cajole Rumania to  her side, would refuse to support Bulgarian aspirations to the annexation  of this province.      In  previous Reports Bulgarian pretensions to  Dobrogea have been cons id ered.   These  pretensions are supported  by practically all  parties  in Bulgaria.  In fact the  strongest  case for the  seizure  of Dobrogea  has been put forward by  the  Geshov and Malinov parties who  are  anxious to secure through Dobrogea future territorial contact with Russia and so create the situation they have always desired of  a  Bulgaria able at will  to play Russia  gainst the Germanic  Empires and vice versa.    A  Dobrogean mission  recently visited Sofia to announce to the  Bulgarian..-Government  and Parliament  the  result of the decisions of the fantastic Constituent Assembly convoked on December  16 last  at Baba Dagh,  in  which union  for  Bulgaria was pleaded on ethnological
grounds.  The case, however, was a very weak one, as evenBulgarian propagandists do not claim a Bulgarian population ofmore than 60,000 or less than 20% in the whole of DObrogea, whilethey admit that the Rumanian population is 55^.  In face ofthese facts allusions to, fancied historical and economic rightsseem to have little value.     Exactly the same sort of propaganda is going on with regardto the Morava Valley, on which Bulgarian writers are issuinga series of text-books &quot;proving&quot; that this whole province waspurely Bulgarian up till its annexation by Serbia in 1833, andthat the population wish for union with Bulgaria.   Both inDobrogea and in the Morava Valley this propaganda is accompaniedby a more efficacious method of winning the province; viz. theextirpation and removal of recalcitrant elements and the plantingof the districts with a Bulgarian population.  It is not, however,quite clear yet that Germany intends to cede Dobrogea to Bulgariawithout condition.  In the peace treaty with Rumania the cessionof Dobrogea was made out not specifically to Bulgaria, but tothe Central Alliance as a whole, and hints have appeared in theGerman press that Bulgaria must earn this reward by acceptingan economic agreement with Mittel-Eurepa advantageous to the latter..The fact that Mr Momchilov, Vice-President of the Sabraniye, onhis return from Bucarest announced at once that &quot;Bulgaria willhave her Dobrogea withant any diminution of her sovereignty overthe province and without agreeing to economic stipulations&quot;, is,perhaps, not conclusive proof that such is the attitude of Germanyon the point.  In fact even Mr Marghiloman finds it difficult toswallow the cession of Dobrogea to Bulgaria, if his reportedutterance in the Pesti Naplo is true that &quot;if Dobrogea is givento the Bulgarians there will be no peace in the East for 50 years&quot;.
According to the Tagliche Rundschau (March 17), a further conditionof Bulgaria&apos;s acquisition of Dobrogea will be the return to Turkeyof the territory on the Maritsa and the Adrianople-Dede Agachrailway which Bulgaria  acquired in the summer of 1915 just beforeher intervention in the war.  Till more accurate information isforthcoming it would be unwise to build much on these divergencesof views between Bulgaria and her Allies, nor could they possiblyinfluence Bulgaria&apos;s whole foreign policy, though any encouragementto anti-German feeling in Bulgaria is, on the whole, an advantageto us, for it prevents a whole-hearted co-operation in Germandesigns.The Economic Position.     There appears to have been little change in the economicposition.  The Sabraniye on February 21 were asked to vote anextraordinary credit of 1,390,000,000 leva (5f million  ) to the1918 budget for war expenses, and at the same time voted about 15mKilon francs to the 1917 budget for the indemnification ofcountry interests for the requisitions of cattle which had beenmade on them.   The Provident Committee sent a Delegation to theUkraine to buy food-stuffs, and latest reports state that some b%of the. total loot will be assigned to Bulgaria.  There continuesto be a great lack of meat, the sugar available is far less thanusual, and the shortage of leather and cloth continues.  On theother hand, the supply of bread is on the whole quite adequate;the ration remains at 400 grams daily, with 600 for soldiers andmanual labourers.  From March 1 on the price to be paid by thewell-to-do  is 80 centimes per kilO and by the poor 65.   Otherarticles of food are also regulated as to price.   Prosecutionsfor profiteering and food-hoarding continue, and it is announced
 that during 1917  11,085 cases of  illegality were  considered,&apos;6,930 persons condemned, and fines amounting to  1,238,107  leva imposed. Elections Postponed.     The faur years&apos; mandate of the present Sabraniye  expires on March 28, and according to the Constitution it should  thien be dissolved and new elections take place on May 28 at. latent. The Constitution, however, also forbids  any elections  while  the Army is mobilised and as it is obviously impossible to demobilise at present there is no alternative for the Sabraniye but to  prolong its own mandate.   Such is the case as Dr Momchilov, Vice-President of the Sabraniye^ has stated it,  and  it  seems obvious  that the Government will  adopt th&amp;s point of view. 22.3.18.
