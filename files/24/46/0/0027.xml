I         S- 7  -    &quot;   -                           S EC R E            Situation 12 noon,  25/5/18.  &quot;&apos; 1.-    South of the Somme,  from right to  left,  the British 5th Army now under the command of General Fayolle,  with French reinforcements, is holding the line from West of Chauny on the Oise through Guivry - Berlancourt - Ramecourt - Rouy to the Somme at Morchain,  Heavy fighting is in progress between the 01 se and Berlancourt..   Worth of Morchain the  enemy has been driven back across the Somme up to Peronne,  and the situation on  this part of the front seems satisfactory.  From Biachos the line runs along the Somme to south of Maricourt. 2,,    North of the SommeP   Last reports  ghow  our troops to be on the line Maricourt - Montauban - Longueval -  east of Martin- puich.  North of this  point the enemy,  whose  attacks have been beaten off yesterday evening and last night,  was again attack-                                                    at  Bapaume ing with great violence this morning,&apos; and the situation/is uncertain.  1$^iw^Qfob^ i&amp;^s^iHfc^s^                                Heavy attacks on the sector from Mory northwards to Wancourt have all been beaten off with loss.   In this fighting the 31st, Guards, 3rd, 40th and 17th Divisions specially distinguished themselves. 3,    The situation from the Somme to Mory at  present causes anxiety as any further advance here would necessitate a with- dravval south of Peronne.   The following are available in this area and fairly fresh    part of the 62nd, 35th and 12th Divisions, whilst the New Zealand Division is arriving in the Albert area at the present time.  It may be necessary to move the detraining areas of the 2 Australian and  1  Canadian Divi- sions further south than was originally intended.  The railways from the south are working at maximum capacity  bringing up French troops.  The enemy has &quot;endeavoured to  interrupt railway movements without success by long range artillery fire on the lines within range.  General Staff,      War Office,         25.3.13.
