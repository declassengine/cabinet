In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at yesterday&apos;smeeting,  I have prepared a provisional draft of a Bill to amend theMilitary Service Acts.  The following notes explain the scope of theBill.1.  The age limit for military service is lowered from eighteen toseventeen years and raised fromto fifty-five years.frQrty-one (now in effect forty-three)  2.  Compulsory service is extended to Ireland and the ChannelIslands and the Isle of ?&quot;an are also included within the Bill.o      Tribunals as.  such are abolished and in their plr.ee AdvisoryCommittees are set up to advise the Minister of National Servicewith regard to the priority in which men should be called up forservice.  The intention is that the Minister of National Serviceshould set up an Advisory Committee in each county with the LordLieutenant preferably as the Chairman-  In Great Britain the person-nel of the existing Appeal Tribunal would ordinarily be used as theAdvisory Committee.  Sub-Committees drawn as a rule from members ofLocal Tribunals in the county would where necessary be appointed toassist the Advisory Committee in dealing with applications from mento have their calling up for service postponed.  All existing exemp-tions issued by Tribunals are cancelled.  It is proposed to gradethe men who fall within the Act into a series of classes probablyfive in number and to call men in Class 1 first the men in the laterclasses not being called uo as a general rule until after the men inthe earlier class have been called, subject always to the power ofNational The Aosj:ice to call men of the higher grades            rcuid recommend that a manCommittit;the Minister offrom any class,should be placed in an early or later class according, to the circum-st anc c s of his case.  1 n t-hest instance to avoid over-crowdingmen over 45 would be Placed in the final class.The exceptions set out in the first schedule toService Act 1916 as subseq,operative.mo 1 y ameno e a             the;/ill no longer b;-ilitary
