SFPECT OP A REBELLION IN, IRELAND ON THENAVAL SITUATION,  AND ggSjg STEPS vv&apos;0ULD BE REQUIRED           W PROTECT NAVAL INTERESTS,(Wax Cabinet question - 27th March,  1918) I  Copy of a. letter from 1st Lord of the Admiralty  to    Secretary,,  War Cabinet, ggTrTSarch,  1918.II  Memorandum by First Sea Lord and Chief cf  Naval    Staff&apos;,  28thKarch, 1918,  &apos;                                       29th Maroh, 1918. ?.*y dear  Hankey,                                   ^           I  forward at  the request  of  the First  Sea Lord a memorandum on the  effect  of  a rebellion in Ireland on the Naval situation,  and what steps would be  required to protect Naval interests.  I hope that the  Cabinet in considering this matter will  realise the fundamental difference between  the Naval interests,in Ireland and the Military  interests  in Ireland.  In the case of the Military the effect on the war  of any  operations in Ireland  would be indirect , and would affect them chiefly, if not solely,  because of the  diversion of energy and resources to quell the rebellion, but in the case of the  Havy serious disturbances in Ireland,  unless Naval  Stations and  Depots  of  all kinds were adequately protected, would  immediately and directly interfere with  the day-to-day operations against the enemy.  In other words, to put it shortly , Ireland to us is in the war zone, but to the Army  it  is not, and therefore it is hoped that in considering any questions of  disturbances  in  Ireland this aspect  of the case will not be over-looked , and it will be  realised that if any inter- ference  with Naval Establishments in Ireland  took place, it might have a very  serious effect on the conduct  of Naval warfare-against  the  enemy.                          Yours sincerely,                                (Signed)  E. GEDDES.Colonel Sir Maurice Eankey,  K.-CB.,   Secretary to the V7ar Cabinet,       2^ Whitehall Gardens,                S.w.l.
         The principal Naval Interests in Ireland may besuwiarised as follows   H&amp;val Bases.

Apart from the Dockyard and Naval establishments atHaulbowline. the imrortat.ce of Ireland to the Navy at thepresent moment lies largely in the fact that it provides hastot the numerous patrol craft which have to be maintained fothe protection against Submarines and mines, of the stream otrade &quot;WhidH passes, both to tho North and South, to and froathe United Kingdom.         The- Coast is divided into six areas for the purposas shewn in attached Statement which gives also centres ofcommunication, W/T Stations, Signal Stations, etc.         The maintenance of supplies of fuel, stores, and prvisions at these bases and the uninterrupted wording of theisystems of communication are essential to the patrols.   Ittherefore necessary that they should be adequately guarded TtMilitary Force to prevent them being interfered with.COIMUNI CATIONS.   3.
