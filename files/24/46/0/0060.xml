MEMORANDUM  BY  LORD  IOTTOH.     In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet ofMarch 20th,  I desire to submit to Lord Curzon the followingmatter upon which I am in disagreement with the Admiralty.     Under an Agreement concluded with Germany on January 2nd,191V, ail interned civilians of over forty-five years of age,merohant^jeamen being specially included,are entitled torepatriation.  Since that date the Germans have repatriatedapproximately 250 eligible merchant seamen, whereas out of anapproximate total of 400 eligible German merchant seamen internedin the United Kingdom not more than 4 appear to have been hithertorepatriated, owing to the action of the Admiralty,     This action is based upon the ground that the status ofmerchant seamen is a matter of dispute between the two Governments     It is submitted that this is no justification for failingto carry out the agreement , and that the persistent retentionof eligible German seamen here constitutes a severe hardship forBritiBh seamen prisoners who are detained as a measure ofretaliation, although in certain cases, over sixty years of age.     Authority is, therefore, eought to enforce the repatriationof German seamen eligible under the agreasment.     It is desirable that an early decision should be arrivedat,  as the service of prisoner transports between Boston andHolland will come to an end in a few weeks.                            (Sd.)  NEWTON.Prisoners of War Department,       Royal Court,            House of Lords , S.W.I.21st March,          MEMORANDUM BY FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.     With reference to Lord Newton&apos;a memorandum dated 21etMarch,  the refusal of the Admiralty  to agree to the repatriationtff all the German merchant seamen eligible under the Agreementof the 2nd January, 1917, is dsm to  the action of the GermanGovernment in treating certain British merchant officers  andseamen as combatants.     The German Government having made the Agreement,  evincedfrom the first an intention not to perform it.  They had  removedlarge numbers of merchant officers and seamen from civilianto combatants camps in November ,  1916, and they continued to dothis at intervals, justifying their  action by saying that themen concerned were of the standing of military prisoners, andthe latest Board of Trade list indicates that there are atpresent 1,474 merchant seamen and fishermen interned at Rtlhlebenas civilians and 1,274 in ether camps, as &quot;being &quot;combatants&quot;.
     Knowing that the German Government regarded nearly half theBritish merchant seamen in their hande as combatant and outsidethe Agreement it would have been inexcusable had we acquiesed inthe violation of the Agreement by Germany and abandoned our onemeans of bringing pressure to bear on them to carry out theirobligations.     Therefore, in order to safeguard the rights of Britishmerchant officers and seamen, particularly those captured fromDefensively Armed Merchant Ships, trie Admiralty declined to all.German seamen to be released until their Government showed thatthey intended to apply the Agreement to all British merchant semen in their hands without distinction.  Lord Newton agreed tothis policy in prisoners of War Department letter of 2nd Januar1917, and has only recently dissented from it.     The Prisoners of &quot;v7ar Department have been pressed by theAdmiralty to make a formal protest to the German Government agaBritish merchant officers and seamen being regarded ether thanas civilians, and to obtain a clear statement of their intentiobut this has-not yet been done explicitly by that Department, auntil a clear understanding is reached as to the status of ourseamen who are not interned at Ruhleben the only course possiblis to hold the German seamen.     I cannot accept Lord Newton1 s statement that the persistedretention of eligible German seamen constitutes a severe hard-ship for British seamen prisoners.  The exact opposite is thecase, since BO long as the German decision to treat the mercan-tile marine as combatants is allowed to pass unchallenged, ourmen do not stand a chance of repatriation, and it was in orderto procure a reversal of that decision and the consequent re-lease of British merchant seamen that the Admiralty and LordNewton agreed to adopt the policy to which he now objects.     The Admiralty have no objection to the release, from timeto time, of as many German seamen as there have been Britishseamen released from Germany, this arrangement to be of a con-tinuing nature and the German seamen to be released to be of %&apos;:same standing as far as possible as the British seamen releasedfrom Germany.  Arrangements to thi3 effect are being made withthe Nome Office and this will remove any possible excuse theGermans may make that our attitude is responsible for a deadloc     Further than this we cannot go until the German Govern-raent agree to repatriate the merchant officers and men whom atpresent they treat as combatants.     I am in accord with Lord Newton1 s desire that all mercharr&apos;seamen eligible under the Agreement, both British and German,should be repatriated, but I cannot agree that we should relea-all of the 4,000 Genr.au seamen in our hands who are over 45,and only receive hack those of the 1,474 men in Ruhleben whoare over that age, and none oiv the 1,274 in other Camps nowregarded by the enemy as c ombatants.

        IllHOTS- BY LOTTO VOdZOX.
