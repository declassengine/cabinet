           Intelligence Bureau,               Department of Information.                         BPV//027.Weekly Report on Poland.  XXVII.     (21st March, 1918.)     1.   The political position in Poland is more hopeless thanit has ever been since the &quot;beginning of the war - no light canbe seen either from within or without.   A barren excitement hasgot hold of the country, not over Cholm. alone, but over every-thing that has happened or not happened in the course of thelast forty-four months.    Here and there some men redeem thehonour of the nation by desperate acts.   Whatever there, wasleft of Pilsudski1s Legions, the men who originally had beentoo conciliatory or too faint-hearted to follow his revolution-ary lead last summer mutinied and tried to break through toRussia.   In some Polish towns demonstrations have taken placein the streets, there have been encounters with the policeand soldiers, and there have been certain numbers of casual-ties.   Politicians organise endless protests which no onereads and few people mind.   Yet others wax,  crawl and in-trigue as of old.     2.   The Polish Army in Russia has definitely gone overto the German side, and by a treaty concluded on February 25between General Dowbor-Musnicki and Colonel von Wulffen,representing the Oberbefehlshaber-Ost, it has been assigneda district west of the Dnieper within whihh it will performauxiliary service to the Germans - guard the  railways,  bridges,stores, etc..   In certain contingencies they even place  them-selves under direct German command on the battlefield.     Yet it would hardly be fair to throw the blame for whathas happened on the Polish officers and soldiers - they had
been put in an impossible position,    The responsibility restswith the national Democrat politicians and their different&quot;National Committees&quot;.   They have formed that Army under con-d it ions and on lines which in the long; run could lead to oneresult only.   Nature takes its course, politics have their ironlaws no less than physics.   The Polish National Democrats standfor social Conservatism and Polish imperialism.   Since the RussiaRevolution Germany has been the stronghold of social Conservatismin Eastern Europe, and conquests at  the expense of Russia canobviously never be made otherwise than with German help.   TheNational Democrats when forming the  Polish Army in Russia loudlyprofessed anti-German sentiments and views.   But sentimentsand views in politics are merely momentary equations; interests .and temperament are the permanent factors.   Even at the timewhen the national Democrat leaders were pressing on revolutionaryRussia the demand that the Polish soldiers who served in theRussian armies should be organised into an independent PolishArmy, they spoke in insulting terms  about the Revolution and theRussian nation, uttered threats against Russia and developedplans of aggrandisement at Russia&apos;s  expense.    Could the Con-ser-vative Poles expect ever to be sufficiently strong to opposeGermany and Russia at the same time, or if not, which way wastheir Army bound to go?   Polish nobles who own the big landedestates in Lithuania, White Russia and the Ukraine were in  -immediate danger of expropriation at the hands of their peasants.With them Polish imperialism would have lost  its last footholdin these districts.   Here was the immediate  problem which facedthe Polish counter-revolutionary, imperialist Army in Russia.Considering the interests for which  the Polish Army stood andwas meant to stand by its organisers, the compromise which theyhave concluded with Germany must be  described as the logic,  andnot as an irony, of history.
                           - 5 -     3.   Meantime Polish delegates from V/arsaw try &quot;by diplomaticnegotiations to secure the &quot;conquests&quot; of the Army of GeneralDowbor-Musnicki.    In the first days of March M. Steczkcwski,Minister of Finance in the Cabinet of k, Kucharzewski (and sincereported to have been appointed Prime Minister), Prince FrancisRadssiwill and Count Adam Ronikier went to Berlin to confer withGerman politicians.   M. Steczkowski is reported to have goneas representative of the Polish government, Prince Radziwill ofthe Regency Council and. Count Ronikier of the Polish Centre, themost fervent advocates of compromise with Germany.   They con-ferred in the first place with Herren David, Erzberger and.Kfaumann-, and proposals are said to have been drawn up for a closePolish-German alliance.   Germany is to abandon all idea of&quot;frontier rect if icat ions&apos;.&apos; at the expense of Poland, the questionof Cholm is to be &quot;carefully considered&quot; and, lastly, Polandis tc receive a wide extension into White-. Russia - the districtsannexed by General Dowbor-Musnicki; in exchange she is tosubordinate herself entirely to Germany in military and economicmatters.   The two things naturally go together.   Poland liesbetween Germany and Russia and never can be equal in strengthto either, still less superior to both together.   She can makeconquests only in one direction.   Any attempt at aggrandisementat the expense of Russia implies therefore dependence on Germanprotection.   It was probably to these proposals that CountHertling referred when he said in his speech of March 19:          ^Suggestions for the shaping of our future relationship     have recently reached government members of the Reichstag     from political circles in Poland.   \/e shall now gladly     examine whether and to what extent these proposals are     reconcilable with the aims pursued by the two governments     which are directed towards permanently living&apos;in good and     neighbourly relations with the newly-arisen State,  while     at the same time safeguarding our ov,n interests.&quot;     Obviously then the proposals are treated seriously.    Thefact that such negotiations should have been carried on  at Berlinwithout Austria seems further to indicate that the Austrian
solution - the idea of uniting Russian Poland with Galicia underthe Habsburg sceptre - has been dropped.     4.   According to a Vienna telegram of the Berlin Lokal-anzeiger transmitted from Amsterdam to the Times and publishedby it on March 19, not only the Polish parties of the Left,but even the groups of peasants and the intelligentsia in theconciliatory Polish Centre have rejected the compromise proposals&quot;agreed upon in Berlin between the representatives of the PolishCentre party and representatives of the Main Committee of theReichstag&quot;.    There can be no doubt that  the masses in Polandare now by no means in a mood favourable to concluding allianceswith the Central Powers.     5.   In the Austrian Parliament, however, concessions toPolish Imperialism have proved sufficient to make the great -majority of the Polish members desert the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs,and,in the division of March 7, save the Austrian government,against which they had inveighed so bitterly but a few days&apos; earlier&quot;Just as half a century ago,&quot; the Heue Preie Presse remarksapprovingly on March 8, &quot;the Poles refused to make common causewith the Czechs and share in political wickedness (on einerpolitischen Verderbtheit  teilnehmen)&quot;.   Before the vote on theBudget the Emperor had summoned representatives of the PolishClub.   At this conference the Poles are  reported to have demandeda promise that Poland would suffer no diminution at the hands  ofGermany, that against the Ukraine the frontier would be fixedon the river Bug (thus also the Ukrainian half of Cholm is tocome under Poland), and that all Galicia  is to remain underPolish dominion.   They obviously received a sympathetic reply -and in deference to the Hofburg abstained from voting againstthe Budget.    The Polish Socialists alone have persisted intheir opposition and left the Polish Club.    The National Demo-crats protested against the decision of the Club, but abstained
with the rest of the Club-from voting against  the Budget.    Aparty meeting of theirs is to determine their  future  relationsto the Polish Parliamentary Club in Vienna.     It is fairly well established that the  Magyars have  actedas intermediaries between the Hofburg and the  Austrian  Governmenton the one hand, and the Poles on the other.   The Magyar interestsare contrary to those of the Czechs and of the Ukrainians -  Slovaksinhabit north-western, Ukrainians north-eastern Hungary.   TheMagyars therefore naturally do not want to see the Poles  joinhands with the Czechs in the Austrian Parliament, and an  East-Galicia under polish dominion is for them the  best safeguardagainst the Ukrainian irredentists.   It is  interesting to notethat Count Leon Pininski, a Polish landowner from East--Galiciawhom the Agence Polonaise of Lausanne has circularised  as a&apos;&quot;&apos;pro-Ally&quot;, was one of the two Polish delegates at the  Budapestconferences.21.3.18.
