/UOlQii(THIS  DOCUMENT  IS.THE  PROPERTY. OP HIS 3HXTAKKIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT, *S E C a E gjG^-4038,IAS   OABIH.EPOSITION OP MEN OF MILITARY APE IN GOVERNMENT OFFICES *     PROPOSED FORMATION OF DEPARTMENTAL TRIBUNALS*Copy of Minute from Lord R* Cecil, to Mr. Balfour,Mr. Baifour.           On the 14th January last I submitted a Minute to    you in which it was proposed&quot;that there should be set up    in this Office a tribunal of three:  one member should be    an official of the Office, such as the Chief Clerk,    another should be a soldier, and the third should be a    Chairman ohosen from the rBnks of public men who have    held office, who aro not in offioe now, such, for instance,    as Lord Selborne.   Before a tribunal so constituted the    cases of all men of military ago employed in the office    would come, end it would deoide finally whether each man    was doing better service to the State by remaining in the    offioe, or by joining the Army.           &quot;I recognise that a elan of this kind, if established    hero, would necessarily have to be established in other    offices under pressure of public opinion, and I therefore    venture to request that if you think right you may lay    this proposal before the Prime Minister.&quot;           I have received this morning an urgent request from    a member of the staff to be allowed to Join, and I venture    therefore again to submit this proposal to you, sinco the    present position of affairs may be thought to have altered    the circumstances which made you think it unacceptable last    January.           AS the matter is very urgent I am venturing to send    a copy to Sir Maurice Hankey for circulation to the War    Cabinet.                                   ROBERT CECIL.FOREIGN OFFICE.     March 26th,  1918.
