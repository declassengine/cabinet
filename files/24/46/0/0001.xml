                     SUMMAHY OF BLOCKADE IKFOK\V.r TPS&apos;         ^               lSth - a st March 1918                 7MMii&apos;   A Bolshevik Commission from Petrogrea has arrived at   Archangel and has apparently assumed control.  It Is at any rate   impossible for the moment to continue our negotiations with the   Archangel State ae an-independent economic community.   The Boi-   sheviks are arranging to send  into the interior the  valuable   Allies stores, which we hoped  torecorer from the Archangel Sovern-   ment in exchange for food supplies.    SJwo shins carrying 6,000   tons of foodstuffs and other necessaries are  already on the ray   to  Murmansk for the relief of Northern Bussia.  We are informing   the Russians at Archangel that these  cargoes  have been despatched:   but that they willnnot be delivered unless the arrangements made   by  the Bolsheviks for sending away the Allied stores are cancelled        The military stores in Finland originally destined for Russia   are in Immediate danger of falling into  the hands of the enemy.   The Finnish Government may at any moment requisition these goods   and send them to Sermany in return for German assistance.   The   Finnish White Guards have a Iready arranged to send  to Germany   1,000 tons of copper, recently  removed from one of the supply   depots of the Kussian fleet, in  return for the munitions with   %hich the Germans have furnished them.    The  Finnish Jov^rmient   still desire to negotiate with H.M,  Jovernmant for  foodstuffs and   for the delivery of the Finnish  transit  ;:oode no?&apos; lying in SwedenI   These negotiations are in the hands  of en  Interallied Committee   at  Stockholm.   This  Committee do not propose to supply Finland   with foodstuffs owing to  the close economic relations now exist-   ing between Finland  and the  Central  rowers.     They  suggest  we   should offer to exchange  the Finnish  transit  goods detained  in   Sweden for the Eassian transit goods  detained in Finland.   O-LRK.    She  Danish  Government still refuse  to authorise theemployment in the danger zone of the 60,000 tons  of Danish  shipr;
 lag claimed  for  tfats purpose by the United States.   They suggest that the United  States Government should obtain this shi^pin? by private agreement with the Danish shipowners, and that the General Agreement with the Banish Government should be confined to the rationing of Denmark.   We noted last week that the two chief shipping oompaniesin Denmark were prepared to supply the 80,000 tons required.SJBL*       Sermon Government have threatened to sink all Swedish   vessels passing through the Cettegot if Sweden includes an   Agreement with the Allies without previously obtaining German consent.   the Swedish Conservatives declare that any further cessions of  Swedish tonnage to the  Hies would be an unneutral act and Urge the Swedish Government to negotiate with Germany for supplies from the Ukraine,  To counteract this propaganda we are publishing the quantities of e reals which we hove promised to put at the disposal of Sweden during April and May.  These include 250,000  tons of cereals in the argentine and 100,000 tons in Australia.       Sweden tos already chartered to the Allies 43,000 tons dead weight  of  snipping out of the 100,000 tons promised under the &quot;modus vivendi%   We have in return sanctioned an immediate shipment to  Sweden of 10,000 tons of phosphates.ffiffAY.     Mr. Ihlen has informed the Storting that the Agreement   between Horway ana the United States will be signed as soon as it has been satisfactorily drafted.    He announced at the same time that the jJoxwegian Government are negotiating an Agreement with Germany under which Sorway will obtain important supplies.    It would appear from this that the Allied-Herweg- ian Agreement has been tacitly accepted by the German Government and that they have considerably modified their recent menacing attitude.
* I^H5RLA!fD3* &apos;  She Dutch Government have failed to make any satis-  s     factory arrangement with the British and United states Governments     for the employment of their shipping in the danger zone under the     proposes&quot; General Agreement,  ?hey agreed that their ships should     &quot;be employed in the bloclc&amp;ecd area hut stipulated that they should.     not he used for the transport of  troops or war materials.  This     stipulation woulS in practioe have made it impossible for us to     use the ships for military purposes at all.  fe accordingly in-     timatod that, unless the Dutch accepted our original proposals     without qualification or eelay, the United States and British     Governments woulfi he compelled to requisition the Dutch shipping     lying within their respective jurisdictions,  ifo answer was re-     ceived to this intimation, and on March  Oth Sir \U Sownley was     instructed to inform the Butch Government that the order for re-     quisitioning the ships had bean issued.             file requis itoned ships will be restored to their owners     at the end of the war and compensation will be paid for any losses     caused by enemy action.  If the owners of ships sunk by the     enemy desire their ships to be actually replaced, arrangements     will be made for laying down the necessary tonnage after the war,     within reasonable limits of time.  We shall pay to the owners     for ships used in the war zone the same  rate s as are already being     paid to the I!orwegians and Danes, namely 55/- per ton dead weight     per month.              We calculate that the tonnage at present lying in Dutch     ports should be more than sufficient to supply Holland with imports     from overseas within the rations allowed under the proposed General     Agreement, and to maintain the Dutch colonial and other services     recognised in the Agreement.   We shell expect all Dutch Imports     from overseas to be earrieo* by the vessels now in Holland.  ^e     are putting 100,000 tonf; of wheat at the disposal of the Hutch     immediately, half in the United States ana&quot; half in fe&amp;e- South America     Bunkering and all other facilities will be allowec to Dutch vessels.

The   Germans have decided not to negotiate for a renewal of the German   Dutch Agreement which expires on  March Klst,  It has provisionally   been arranged that the old Agreement shall continue,  i;r, droller   has definitely ascertained that the German Government will he unable   to spare any cereals for Holland from the Ukraine,  Mr, Loud on m-   tbrmed the states General this week that the Germane  recently re-   fused an application from the Dutch G overrun en t for 100,000 tone of   wheat,U8IJ2KP SgAffiiS,   Congress has passed a Bill conferring on President   Wilson power to dispose of enemy property &quot;by sale or otherwise ac-   eording to his discretion.
