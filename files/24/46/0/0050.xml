H     LUKE. 86/3/1918.       Conscription can be enforced but with the greatest difficulty. It will be bitterly  opposed by the united Nationalists and the Clergy, The present time is the worst for it since I have been in Ireland because the cry will  be England down Ireland1s opportunity.. Some of the difficulties would be organised strikes dislocating thei life of the country Railway,  Post Office and  tTelegraphs communications oiitT  Inere are fewer troops in Ireland than there have been for some time.  More have to be taken.  We would have to have additional troops for the time at least two Brigades (? I think considerably more), these I do not anticipate would be required for more than three  months.      Ireland would have to be divided into several districts.  It would be a question that will have to be considered if compulsion is put in force in the whole  simultaneously or district by district.  But to render it fessible either way the country must be put under some kind of military control.   Law would have to be dropped because ordinarily for the first fortnight  at least there would be bloodshed and  a great deal of suffering to the civil population in every way and hardships.      The number of men we would get I cannot estimate.   Ten months ago I estimated 160,000 with very liberal exemptions.  It ought to be more now with increased age.  I am of opinion that gome of the men when got would make good and reliable  soldiersja considerable number might bo likely to give troublej  Thepolice wouIa&quot;have to &quot;be&quot; concent rat e d into*&quot;*larger parties &quot;onuscurtailing &quot;Their usefulness. ^oast&apos;Watching would be interfered withalso tillage.     I world suggest that the first thing is to get all knownleaders out of the way at once,  extra troops should be on the spotsimultaneously  and everyone irrespective of who he is arrested onfirst sign of giving trouble.     These measures would be drastic but the situation isserious or it&quot; would not be considered necessary to haveconscription   at this inopportune time.
