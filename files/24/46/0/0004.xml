3 C B B 2.-T                   WAR CABIBBT.T -4004.  -&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;                00KDITI0B 0? IRELAND.             ......^Memorandum by the Chief Secretary.     Lord Curzonrs statement of the  Irish  situation on March 12th in the House cf lords explained in the  fullest possible way the present difficulties of the Irish problem,  the elements of hope and of difficulty which it contains,  and the  grounds  on which coercive action had been withheld in the circumstances which prevailed during the autumn and winter  months but had recently been applied vigorously and with the apparent prospect of success. The measures which I had directed to be taken in the  third week jf February with the sanction  of the War Cabinet, were of three kinds, viz:- the establishment of a  military  control  in certain  areas where lawlessness of a  more or less insurrectionary character was becoming unmanageable  under  ordinary police methods, the introduction of military reinforcements to support the constabulary in districts where agrarian disorder had been or- ganised on a serious scale, and the  withdrawal from the Irish prison system of the practice  of the temporary release of prisoners who by means of self-starvation may  put themselves in peril of sudden death from collapse.    I had  also received authority to proceed toward the removal out of Ireland  of  certain  leaders of the seditious agitation in the country, but administrative difficulties on both sides of  the Irish Channel prevented prompt-action in this respect^ if it  had been  immediately desirable, as to which there was some ground for doubt.     The county of Clare was the area where in February something like a.revolt seemed possible, and that county is now in the fourth week of its experience  of as  stringent a control as could be applied, under the Defence of the  Realm  Regulations.   The restraints imposed where they  are at their maximum of stevtarity in certain limited districts in which outrages had been committed or attempted, place the daily  life of the  people under strict regulation, in such a manner that passage  on  the highways can  only be had by leave of the local commandant, fairs and markets cannot be held, public houses are closely regulated, and people must  be indoors except during daylight.   The need of some restraint is generally admitted even in Clare; its complete character begins to cause a good many protests.   Generally the attitude of the disaffected parts of the population  is  that of sullen endurance. The &quot;peace&quot; of the county is kept, but  I do not anticipate that any pledges of future good behaviour will  be  forthcoming yet. Two good, effects result from the experiment v.  the officers commanding the troops and the  men themselves  have gained experience of a kind of duty which may have to  be  performed in other districts if things go amiss, and in some .?ther areas in the South and *&apos;&apos;ost which seems likely to need special means of restraint the object lesson of Clare is being taken to heart.    The town of Thurles in Tipperary was a prominent centre  of  disaffection,  so that there was a reasonable and intelligent anticipation that a  special military district would be formed there.    Its formation was in lact authorised, and troops had been quartered in the town. Some prominent people of the town approached  Sir Bryan Mahon, however, and begged that they might  have an opportunity of restoring
 good order*   Sir Bryan made no promise, but  encouraged them tc-^exsart thorns-elves promptly.   The result has been  remarkable.&apos; On !fert3&amp;-13th the behaviour of a Sinn Fein mob  in the  town v/as g0 violent and threatening that the- Courrty Inspcotcr called for c onsid^rable--^reinforcejaerits^Df&apos; police and support of troops and expressed great alarm as to the prospect  of maintaining order even with this aid,   From the time of the interview between the local people and the military aiithorities things have steadily improved.   To-day&apos; s report from the County Inspector sayaa-  &quot;&quot;For the first time in a long period  I  feel  we have a &quot;grip of the lawlessness and mischief that is going  on in the &quot;town, and X m satisfied that it is now only a question of &quot;keeping up the pressure to stamp it out.&quot;    &apos;7hat operated in the minds of the townsmen was. I believe that Thurles  depends on its markets and fairs for its livelihood.      The counties of Sligo -and Hoscommon were those  in which under incitements from     L. Ginnell,       and  others, the Sinn Fein Clubs had caused widespread and systematic dis- turbance by cattle driving and unlawful ploughing of pasture.-and conse-quetrt ^c^u2i2ixd^^^th the Constabulary.  Troops were sent to the aid of the police in dealing with these  riotous proceedings upon a well^ oj^anlsed plan with the result that the conspiracy was daife^rfced&apos;&apos;, large, amber a of arrests were made and offenders promptly sentenced to imprisonment  and  some  scores of men are now undergoing sentences for taking  part  in this land Campaign..  I&amp;r. Ginaall,      has been evading- arrest for about a fortnight&apos;but will be arrested and  prosecuted.      Many men involved in the more conspicuous  proceedings  of the Sinn Fein combinations have been re-arrested  for offences tnTiinXaw^X^a^Sishly, illegal drilling, and other breaches of the Defence ReguJLiLtions., it being now practicable,  at any rate for the present, to subject them te effective imprisonment, notwlthstsoading the threat of hunger aiyt&amp;c,      A considerable&quot;number of arrests for recent offences have also been mads,   Eor&apos; long will elapse before some new scheme i3 devised for attracting perverse sympathy to&quot; lawbreakers of  these classes I cannot foresee.   Among lav/-abiding people, however,  there is a tendency toward self^or^p^rtrulation as though the  degroe  of quiet secured by recent exceptional measures  gave the  promise of tranquillity in the country.  This is probably  a too sanguine expectation, but I think it likely that if the  cccurrence of serious crime In a locality is henceforth,.faliowed up  promptly by the application of means such as those now in  use in Clare any gejieral tendency to lawlessness may for the time be restrained.      Raiding for arms still occurs but tc a diminished extant in the wilder parts of the Test and some districts of  the South. There is no disposition on the part of the &quot;victims&quot; to  give any help toward bringing the offenders tc justice.   In Galway, Kerry and Cork and some parts of Tipperary, as  -oil  as in scattered areas elsewhere drilling of the Irish Volunteers  goes on in remote places,  and even occasionally in the neighbourhood of towns, in circumstances which make prevention  by  the  police practically impossible.   There are frequent prosecutions,  with results which seem to me very inadequate, and I am convinced  that such drilling - popular as It is in itself and  as a  defiance  of the Regulations - will continue until some new  means of  checking it can be found.  I suggested some time since to  the &quot;or  Cabinet that by an amendment of the Military Service Act  men who  take part in drill in Ireland should be made thereby subject  to military service and be deemed to be attested as  an  Englishman is when he reaches the qualifying age *  Sir Bryan  Mahon a d  the Inspector General of the? Constabulary agree&apos; in  thinking  tact  suci
a provision would be capable of enforcement and that in oneway or the other it would put an end to the practice of drillingwhich is the real menace of the Sinn Fein organisation.     $he sittings of the Irish Convention are about to cometo a close.  The Convention has been engaged to-day in thediscussion of the last of the proposals to be brought beforeit.   The resumed sittings after  aster will be devoted toconsideration of the Report which is to be presented to thePrime Minister and which will probably be completed in Easterweek..   Great anxiety prevails throughout the country as to theoutcome of the Convention and as to the steps which may betaken by the Government in consequence of the forthcomingReport.  One result is a marked abatement in the violencewhich for some time characterised the behaviour of the leadersof Sinn Fein.  The movement, however, remains dangerous.
