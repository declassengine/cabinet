Our onlycasualty was one wireless telegraphy rating wounded.    Minelaying operations in the  North Sea and  in the  Heligoland Bight have  beencontinued.    R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk have carried out a number of patrols and recon- Flandersnaissances, during which they destroyed 10 enemy aircraft and drove eight down out of area.control.   An enemy kite balloon, which had broken adrift, was also shot down.  One ofour machines failed  to return.    On  March 10th, at 6.15 p.m.,  the hospital ship &quot; Guildford Castle,&quot; when 24 miles BristolS.W. of Lundy Island, was attacked by a submarine.  A torpedo struck the ship, but failed Channel.to explode.    On March 14th a reconnaissance flight over Constantinople was carried out  by two of Mediter-our machines.  Observers  reported that &quot;  Goeben &quot; was still alongside a jetty in Stenia ranean.Bay.                   ATTACK  UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.    The number of large enemy submarines  operating this week has been smaller than Submarinesduring the last few weeks, only 14 to 16 having been located, five of which were of the operating.converted  &quot; Deutschland &quot;  type.   Of the latter, one was to the westward of Ireland,homeward bound, two were 150 to 300 miles west of Gibraltar and the others were probablyin the vicinity of the Canary Islands.  Only four large submarines were working in HomeWaters (other than the North Sea), and the English coast of t the Channel and the Irish. Seawere again the areas of greatest activity.

One of the &quot; Results&quot; above referred to was mainly attributable to a depth chargedropped at random by a destroyer, after a submarine had attacked and sunks.s. &quot; Amazon &quot;on March 15th.  Shortly afterwards the submarine came to the surface three or four milesaway with, damaged  hydroplanes and unable to  dive.  The  submarine  surrendered anddestroyed  herself, and one  officer and  10  men  were taken prisoners.   A preliminaryexamination of the prisoners showed that the depth charge  caused sufficient damage tocompel the submarine to rise to  the surface.

So far as regards  British tonnage,  the week under  review is the best since thatended January 19th, notwithstanding that these losses include the &quot;Amazon&quot; of over10,000 tons, but the aggregate of the tonnage losses of all nationalities remains at aboutthe average for the last few weeks.
    The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and Losses ofof losses by enemy action, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British, merchant British ^steamships of over 500 tons gross register ; and the table in Appendix II shows by trades, steamshipsas regards such ships, the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnage sailing ln    eS*to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.    The percentage of losses&quot; to sailings as regards British tonnage employed this week inOverseas Trades is 1-06 last week there were no losses in these trades.  In Coasting andCross-Channel&apos; traffic, notwithstanding  that  a larger tonnage was  engaged, there is aconsiderable reduction in tonnage lost,  with  the result  that the percentage of losses  tosailings in this traffic is this week only &quot; 40 as against 1*15 last week.  As regards all trafficto and from the United Kingdom, the percentage is this week -62 as against  -71 last week.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areasas well as British, sunk, damaged and unsuccessfully  attacked in the last two weeks by in whichenemy craft and by  mine,  classified according to areas.                                 vessels lost.    There is a marked reduction this week in the number of attacks on foreign shipping,but the percentage, of successful attacks on such shipping is considerably higher  than inthe previous week.   Enemy submarine activity was slightly increased in the English Channeland reduced in the Irish Sea,  while in the Mediterranean the  total number of attacks islittle more than half the number for the previous week.    The total number of vessels of all nationalities which  sailed to and from the United VesselsKingdom in Overseas-trades in the month of February was 1821, and of these 1547 sailed engaged inin convoy and 274 independently of convoy.  Nineteen attacks  were made on  the 274 ^&apos;^&quot;r^^&apos;non-convoyed vessels, whilst of the 1547 convoyed vessels only 12 were attacked whilst in     attacksconvoy and 19 before joining or after dispersal.                                        thereon.               mat    The total number of enemy attacks made upon  shipping  of all nationalities during Enemythe month of February was 156 as against 164 in January, and the following table shows the attacks inmethod and result of such attacks and classifies the vessels- as to whether in convoy  or Februarynot-at the time of attack:-                                                 &apos;       classified.

ENEMY MINES.    Enemy minelaying activity this week has been confined to the Firth of Forth, wheremines were laid in the channel south of May Island.    The mines laid in the approaches to the River Mersey, referred to in last week&apos;sAppreciation, have now all been accounted for, and within 24 horns of the Mersey beingreopened 114 vessels, representing an aggregate tonnage of  over  a quarter of a million,and including two of the largest ships in the world, passed in and out.  If one of theselarge ships were sunk in the Queen&apos;s  Channel the port would be closed to heavy draughtvessels for a considerable period, and a very large amount of tonnage would thereby berendered idle.

The number of Howitzers and Bomb Throwers delivered to date is 826.    1,488 Merchant Vessels have now been fitted with Otter Installations, and the number of Mine pro-Warships fitted with Paravane Equipment is 361.                                    Section gear.                       MOVEMENTS  OF ENEMY SHIPS.    During the past fortnight there has been a marked increase in the number of enemy Merchant-merchant ships trading between Germany and Norwegian ports outside the. Cattegat, 12 men-having arrived at and 11 having sailed from such ports during the week under review.   Nosuch ships have entered  or left Rotterdam, but the enemy coal trade from Delfzyl remainsabout as usual.                      FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.                                      Russia.    On March 12th Admiral Razvasov  (the late C-in-C, Baltic Fleet,  who resigned  inDecember last owing to alterations in Admiralty Administration) was unanimously chosenas Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Fleet.   He accepted the position on condition thathe has  absolute power over all  &quot; Committees &quot; and full responsibihty without  ordersfrom Petrograd and that the crews shall render absolute obedience to Commanding Officers.He holds his appointment only so long as may be necessary to meet the present situationcaused by the German advance in Finland.    On the same day  four Dreadnought Battleships and two Cruisers  accompanied bytwo ice-breakers left Helsingfors  for Kronstadt and all ships are to be got ready forimmediate destruction, which, however, is not to be effected without direct orders from theC-in-C.  A delegation has been sent to Abo to ascertain German intentions  regardingRussian warships in Finnish waters, and  further action will be taken as soon as the resultis  known.    The British submarines in the Baltic are ready  for destruction,  and the  necessaryarrangements have been  made  for  evacuating  the personnel.  There are 10 Britishmerchant vessels still in Finnish waters.    There are considerable quantities of  metals and other goods which were destined forRussia lying  in Finland and the British Naval Attache has  been given a free hand topurchase and destroy stores at Helsingfors,  which might be of value to the enemy.  Anoffer is being  made to a Finnish Syndicate to purchase any Finnish merchant vessels andtheir cargoes  which succeed in reaching  a Swedish or Norwegian port.    Further Allied reinforcements have  been sent to Murmansk, and a British Cruiserand two armed  ice-breakers are  now proceeding with foodships to Archangel, for thepurpose of bartering food for the stores lying in that port.    On March 13th Odessa was occupied by the Germans, who claim to have captured 15warships.  The greater portion of the Black Sea Fleet remains at Sevastopol,  where ithas been for  many months, but seven old Destroyers  (completed in 1905) are  based onSulina for convoy work with Roumanian barges, working between Odessa and the Danube,and these Destroyers may have been at Odessa and possibly also some gunboats from theDanube River  Forces.   Besides these  the 2nd, 5th, 6th,  9th,  and 10th Divisions ofTransports are, based on Odessa and use the floating dock, which has a lifting power of4,800 tons, for repairs.                                     France.    The reorganization of  the Algiers and Tunis Patrol Divisions is now complete.  Sixdestroyers have  been  moved from Salonika to Algiers and the Auxiliary Patrols  havebeen considerably reinforced.    Torpedo  Boat No. 333, which was completed in 1906 and employed on harbour defenceat Bizerta, was sunk on March 12th in a collision&quot; with an English steamer.   All the crewwere saved.

                                      Spain.    An order  has been promulgated for the establishment  of a  Submarine School atCartagena, and the four submarines which Spain possesses will all be appropriated forinstructional work.  Officers and men now entering the submarine service are to be under25 years, and the age limit for service, except for officers and men now serving, is fixed at30 years.Naval Staff,    21st March, 1918.[Appendices.
