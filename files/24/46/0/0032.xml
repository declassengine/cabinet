SITUATION IN RUSSIA.

Telegram No. 82 from Sir W. Wiseman to Sir Eric Drummond, dated 21st March, 1918.

NEW YORK.

Following is for Sir Eric Drummond from W :-

Number 82.

Following is paraphrase of cable from Admiral Knight, United States Commander-in-Chief, Far East to Navy Department, dated March 18th. Colonel House says he and the President consider this message gives very interesting and sane view of the situation and requests me to send you copy :-

Message begins :- There exists possibility that part of munitions may be destroyed, as they are scattered in armouries ever many miles making it impracticable to guard all sections efficiently, but that for the same reason it is impossible that any great quantity could be destroyed if such an attempt were at all successful. There is moreover absolutely no danger at present that munitions now here (Vladivostok) will reach Germans.    German agent in Kudrisheff reported as having been sent to the Far East to arrange for destruction of munitions was arrested and hung by Cossacks several weeks ago and his funds diverted to support Colonel Semenoff, leader of the force operating near Chita. I am collecting details of information concerning location of individual items of munitions and preparing chart which will make it possible to keep general oversight of them without antagonising. Do not consider danger great but will be on the alert.

There is danger that German influence are at work in Siberia - in some cases supported by Bolshevik elements, in others opposed. No evidence of substantial progress in Eastern Siberia.

Very difficult to obtain reliable information from other parts of Siberia but will continue efforts. Many conflicting reports concerning Bolsheviks attitude towards Germans. My belief, that attitude varies at different times and different places and that individual influences (? instances) of co-operation cannot be accepted as indications of general policy. Undoubtedly many Bolsheviks are German agents but many others are honest and hate Germany. Opinion is widely spread that Lenin is an idealist but that Trotsky is in pay of Germany.

Reports that German and Austrian prisoners have been armed are not at present true but appear to have some foundation in other parts of Siberia. Wounded men arriving Harbin, March 8th. from Colonel Semenoff, who had been engaged in battle with Bolsheviks near Manchurian station on railway, were well interviewed by my Aide-de-Camp Patterson and stated positively that they had been engaged in close quarters by men whom they recognised as Germans. One of these witnesses
was a Siberian who stated he had fought Germans onRussian front and could not be mistaken regarding :their identity.   I think this to be true but do notregard it as proving that prisoners are bein^ generallyarmed and shall endeavour to clear up this point.Report apparently trustworthy that large numbers ofprisoners in Irkursk have been armed and that they areprepared to destroy bridges and tunnels on Trans-Baikal railway.         Referring to reports in Japan thrt German mili-tary forces are likely to appear in Eastern Siberiaand along coast and waters of Pacific - Ocean, I regardthese as preposterous;  one -?reat danger to be fearedis that German po^er will reach area immediately lastof the Ural Mountains ^here immense supplies of grainexist.   I am not in a position to estimate probabil-ity of this, but if the military situation as known tothe United Strtes does not indicate * it as a realdanger, it is 3afe to say that no real necessity existsfor armed intervention- in Siberia, unless such inter-vent ion is desirable for the establishment of law andorder.         At present existing conditions in most parts ofSiberia under local Bolsheviks are recognised as in-tolerable and this quite as much by friends of Russiandemocracy as by its enemies.   Resulting dissatisfac-tion amongst all classes is finding expression in moreor less active resistance at many points and nay re-sult in a re-action towards imperialism.   -Thistendency.can only be checked&apos;by modifying conditionsout of which it is developing,, but I do not believethe hope of checking it lies in intervention from theoutside.   It lies I believe in the growing recogni-ticn by the Russian people themselves of the distinc-tion between liberty and license and in their supportof the forces standing for the establishment of orderand the protection of life arid property.&quot;   While evi-dence on the subject is contradictory and confusing; Ibelieve that on the whole po&quot;&apos;er of the extreme radicalfaction is declining and that of the constitutionalistsincreasing end that order will gradually be estate-lished by the people to this end through establishmentof temporary government for Siberia,   At present thesemovements lack unity but efforts are beim- made to gettogether for the corraon aood.   One of the mostpromising of these movements centres about availablemembership of the Siberian provincial conferenceelected by all provinces of Siberia, which convened atTomsk- in December 1917 and was broken up by the Terror-ists.                                                  x         If for any reason armed&apos; intervention in Siberiais decided upon, it-is of the first importance that Japanshould net be permitted to act alone.  - This is the onepoint on which everybody, who knows conditions andsentiments in Russia, is absolutely agreed,   It isuniversally believed by Russians that Japan desires totake large part of Siberia, and no arguments can shakethis belief.   On the other hand Japan&apos;s military menstate they will not operate with the force of any otherPower, having had experience of this in the. Tsing-tauChina campaign.   Thus very difficult situation iscreated and one wbieh can probably be arranged onlyby compromise.
     I venture to suggest following&apos;for consideration, aspossible compromise, if intervention ultimately becomesnecessary to check German advance,  American, British,French, and. Italian force to take control in Yladivostockand Amur railway as far as its junction with the directline at Karymskaya. with line of communication throughtheir own railway i i.e* the South Manohurian Railway)and via Harbin not through Vladivostoek.  Occupation ofVladivostock and neighbouring territory to be naval opera-tion and Harbin railway to be held by military forces ofthe Powers above mentioned to the number of about 10,000.?/hatever plan is adopted should be preceded by proclamationto the Russian people signed by all the Powers concerned,solemnly promising that no territory or privileges of anykind will be retained.    Full understanding should bereached that the Westward advance should not stop short ofthe Ural Mountains, where Germans must be held if the pur-pose of the campaign is to be accomplished.   It should bemade clear also that the movement is not one of antagonismto any party in Russia even though it may be necessary toassume temporarily an attitude of antagonism in order tobreak through weakness, disorganisation and perhaps treachernow existing,  and which are covering German advance inCentral and Eastern Russia and specially towards rich grainareas of ?;est Siberia already referred to,     Following have seen this message and. entirely agreewith.it:-    Senior British Naval Officer, American andBritish Consul,                    (Signed)   Knight,                         Commander-in-Chief Asiatic Fleet,
