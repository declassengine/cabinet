Colonel himCopy of a letter frorr1 Lord Stamfordham to Mr.. Baifour ,               In case you are going to a War Cabinet Meeting          this morning where the subject of the Japanese Mission          rray he discussed,  I write to let you know that the          King will not he able to send Prince Arthur of Con-          naught as Chief of the Mission, and the Duke of          Connaught&apos;s going is quite out of the question on ae-          count of his health.               His Majesty is against the idea of introducing          into the Military Mission either political or commer-          cial members, or Propaganda Agents, and he thinks it          would he much better to send General Sir Arthur Paget          as tho Head of the Military Mission for the purpose of         -taking the Baton of a British Field-Marshal to the          Emperor of Japan,    If you consider it advisable to          attach a Diplomatic Agent to this Mission, Mr, Alston          from Peking might join it.               The Propaganda Mission should, in the King&apos;&apos;s          opinion, he a separate Body,                                 (Signed)   Stamf ordham?          Buckingham Palace,                March 21st,  1918,&amp;e Right Honourable  A. J, Baifour, 0,M,, M,P,,           ,     &amp;C, ,     OGC..
