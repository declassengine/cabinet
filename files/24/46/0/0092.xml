SECEET.0103/9(581.INTERIM  REPORT.                  PRISONERS OF WAR EMPLOYMENT  COMMITTEE.    1.  This i Committee  was set up at the end  of 1916, in succession to a former committee.established in September, 1916, which  acted in an advisory capacity to the War Office.  Theearlier  committee was formed originally with a view  to  the employment of prisoners of warupon the reclamation of land, but it also forwarded recommendations to the War Office regardingvarious other proposals for the employment of this labour.    Ifc  was afterwards decided, however, that the use of prisoner  labour should be extended  andmade available for all suitable purposes of urgent national importance, and the present Committeewas formed in December. 1916, with the following terms of reference :          &quot; To consider all  applications for the employment  of prisoners of war, and to decide             whether they should be adopted.&apos;&apos;    Representatives of the chief departments concerned in the  employment of labour are  includedin the  new committee,  and representatives of the Home Office  and War  Office  (Directorate ofPrisoners of War) attend in an advisory capacity regarding technical and administrative  details.    The Home  Office and the Ministry of National Service were added to the lists  of departmentsrepresented in January and October, 191 I, respectively.    2.  The Committee has held 48 meetings during the year U&apos;17, and 5 meetings in 1918.    3.  The Committee consider proposals for the employment of  both  combatant and  internedcivilian prisoners of  war.   The conditions of employment  and  the progress made in  eitherdirection are  best dealt with separately.    (a.)  COMBATANT PRISONERS OF WAR. Certain deductions must be made from the grand totalof prisoners in this country before the balance can  be obtained  to be regarded as available forthe purposes of the committee.  Officers are not allowed to work, and non-commissioned officerscannot be  employed unless they volunteer (SEE Section (5)).  The  gangs of prisoners must  notbe mixed with civilian British, or  civilian Alien labour, and must be separated  from  such labouras much  as possible.   No application must be put forward until the  resources of the local labourexchange have  been exhausted.   The  statement in Appendix A, attached to  this report, givesdetails of the combatant prisoners of war in this  country, from returns of the  week ending16th February, 1918.  Appendix A (i) indicates the prisoners allotted but not vet employed.    (&amp;.)  INTERNED  CIVILIAN PRISONERS OF WAR. These men  cannot  be compelled  to work, andconsiderable  difficulty has been experienced regarding their  employment, especially in view ofthe recent note verbale of the German Government forbidding civilians to work outside theirinternment camps.    All questions relating to the employment of these men inside their camps and  the release ofindividuals to approved work are still dealt Avith by the Home  Office, but various suggestionshave been put forward by the Committee for consideration for employment of these civilians  ONbasket making, manufacture of artificial eyes and optical lenses, &amp;c.    At the present time, 1,847 civilians are employed outside their parent camps.    4.  Two difficulties have been found to interfere with  the speedy employment of prisonersonce they are allocated,  viz.,. the provision of guards and accommodation.    The first difficulty has  been in part overcome by restricting the size of the Avorking camps,except those for agricultural purposes, to a minimum of 100 men,  the number being increasedwherever possible.  After consultation with the military authorities concerned, and in view of theexperience gained in the larger camps, the Committee have recommended to the War Office  theabolition of guards for small  parties  of men employed in the neighbourhood  of  their  workingcamps  and returning to  such camps at night.  The  suggested practice, which chiefly affects thesmall agricultmal camps, has been approved and is now being  carried out.    As regards accommodation, the Committee have found that some delay is almost unavoidablein this  respect between the  date of allocation and the date of actual commencement of work,owing  to the difficulty in providing the material and labour needed  for construction of the campswhich  have to  be hutted, unless the  men are only required  in the summer months or availablepremises can be adapted.   The  Committee have  represented to the authorities  concerned theimportance of providing accommodation for the prisoners directly they are allocated, in  view oithe  resulting gain in work done, and consfderable improvement  has  been effected, while animproved method of inspection and administration, recently suggested, should result in  speedieremployment.    5.  Returns are furnished to the Committee at each meeting showing the total number of prisonersemployed, the number allocated and awaiting employment (with any reasons for delays),  and thenumber available for distribution.   Applications for prisoners are  then considered  in view of thebalance available and the relative importance of the work involved,  special regard  being given tothose classes of work which have been given priority by decision  of the War Cabinet.   It has,however, been noted that although particular demands have often been represented as of peculiarurgency, no special steps have been correspondingly taken to secure rapidity of employment oncethe prisoners were allocated.

     6. Owing to the delay which occurs in  the provision of accommodation, arrangements havebeen made whereby prisoners may  be employed  temporarily in the vicinity of  the  parent campsupon approved work, chiefly of an agricultural character.  This scheme has met with considerablesuccess and has effectively bridged  over the period of waiting for the completion of working camps.On 9th February, 1918, 2,87b men were so  employed.  At the suggestion of the Committee theWar Office have issued instructions to the Camp Commandants  regarding the voluntary employ-ment of non-commissioned officers, but it has not been possible to make any great progress inthis  respect.  On 9th February.  1918, 918 non-commissioned officers were employed.     7. Appendix B (i) attached to this report gives details  of the present employment of theprisoners now working.     In addition, prisoners have been employed on various schemes  now completed, details ofwhich are given in Appendix B (ii).     S. The War Cabinet having decided that the  allocation  of  prisoners of  war  should  betransferred to the Ministry of  National Service, the Committee ceased to function as a separatebody from Friday, 8th February, 1918, and now acts as a siib-committee of the National LabuurPriority Committee.     9.

To the ability and assiduityof our Secretary. Mi&apos;. Rose way, our warm thanks are  also due.                                         (Signed)  JAMES F.
