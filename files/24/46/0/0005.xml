(This DocHis Rritarii  SECRET.\  N.S.R. 50V\            SUPPLY OF PERSONNEL FOR THE AIR FORCE.       MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE.     In accordance with the War Cabinet decision  (No.361, Hin.17)a Conference, presided over by Lord Rothermere, Was held on the18th March, at which the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministryand Ministry of National Service were represented.     The first three fce^ariments were unable to agree as to theallocation of recruits; and I was therefore requested to submit &apos;the position to the War Cabinet for a final ruling.     The position may be summarised as follows     As the Air Force was not a separate entity at the time whenthe proposals of the Admiralty and the War Office wer** submittedto and considered by the Man Power Committee of the War Cabinet,the demands for personnel for tha Air Force were included in thsdemands of the Navy and Army respectively.     The Cabinet Committee recommended in paragraph 52 of theirdraft report (G.185) the following levy and allocation of recruitsfor the year 1918:     (a)   For the Navy and R.N.A.S.,  - 50,000 Grade 1 men over           the age of 18 years 8 months.      (b)   For the Army (including the R.F.C.),  - 100,000 Grade 1           men over the age of 18 years 8 months.                        100,000 Lower  Grade men.                        120,000 A.4 boys.     In paragraph 70 (lTa) the Committee  recommended that thefighting personnel requirements of the Royal Navy and of the AirServices should have absolute priority over all  other Services,     Up to the end of February,  of the 50,000 Grade 1  men over18 years 0 months allocated to the Navy and R.N-.A.S.,  4,516- havealready been recruited.,    Of these,  3,025 have been posted  to theNavy and 1,491 lc the R,N.A,S.   During the same period 6,608 ladsbetween 3 8 and 18.8 and 1.227 lowsr category men have  been  recruitedfor thes&amp;  services.   Of the lads 3,922 have been posted to  theNavy and 2,686 to the R N 0 A -S 5 end of  the lower  category men 297have been posted to the Navy and 930 to the R\N,A..S.    In addition2,467 boys under 13 have been posted to the Navy and 1,346  to theR.N.A.S.&quot;     The War Cabinet will remember that,  after  the draft reporthad been circiviated,  General Smuts was requested by the War Cabinetto go into certain further figures submitted by  the Army Council.On his instructions derailed tables were  prepared by the Ministryof National Service snowing estimates  of  ihs numbers of men re-quired during -one pro cent year for new units and reinforcements  onthe basis of varying degrees of heavy  fighixng.    These tablesincluded provision for the Royal Flying Corps,    The results of
 General  Smuts&apos;  investigation were summarised in Sir Maurice HankeyU Memorandum,  M.P.C.  30 dated 17th January,    So far as I am aware this Memorandum Has not been considered by the War Cabinet.      In .my statement in the House of Commons-on the 14th January,  I-gave 420,000 as the minimum number of- men  whom it would be necessary to recruit from civil life  during 3.918.   This figure,  which was sub- mitted to  and approved by the Prime-Minister,  was based on the above Tables,  and included a further 50,000 Grade 1  men,  over the age of 18 years and 8  months,  for  the Army and the Air Force,  bringing the total  number of such recruits for the Army and Air Force up to 150,000.      Although the Cabinet Committee provisionally assessed the alloca- tion for the Navy and the R.N.A.S.  at 50,COO,  the demand of these Services was approximately  105,000,  48,000 being for the R.N.A.S,  and 57,000 for the  Navy.    in these circumstances  it is contended by the Air Ministry that if a quota of 50,000 only is approved,  this quota should be  allocated between the Navy and R.N.A.S.,  as nearly as possible in  the proportion  of 57  to 48.   The  Admiralty decline tc accept this  contention,  and.;state that the necessary number of men for the Navy alone  exceeds  50,000;  an additional demand of 7,000being foreshawdowed;.and they further ,state,that,  unless  the full naval  demand is&quot;met,  they, will  be forced to reduce  the  number of ships  in commission.    Provided their total demand,  estimated at 64,000 is  allowed,  the  Admiralty  would be  prepared to reduce their claim for  Grade 1 men over  18,8 to  26,000  leaving the balance to be made up of lads between 18  and 18.8  and.boys under  18.  .  In this case they  would be  able  to  surrender to the Air Force approximately 24.000 of  the .50,000 Grade  1 men  allocated to  them.  ,           &apos;&apos;&apos;      The demand of,  the  Air  Force,  as  against the Army,  has  been set out in the Memorandum-G.T&quot;.  3727,.  dated 22nd-February, already cir- culated by Lord-Rothermere;This: amounts s . as from March. 1916. to January 1919, to 57 j 7 00. men or,  alternatively,  to  42,700 men,- if the arrangements&quot;of. the U.S,  Government,. referred  to in  the&apos;Memorandum are carried  out.                                        ,     &quot;      If the  Air Force  obtain 24,000  men from the total  of  50.-C00 for the&apos;Navy and;R.N. A..S.,  the  Air  Ministry are reasonably,  satisfied that it will not  be  necessary, as against  the. Army.,  tc  increase  the  demand set out in Lord Roihermere;s Memorandum,&apos;   If,  however, 24,000  men are not allotted to them from the Naval quota,  the  demand&quot; of the Air Force  as against the  Army will  be increased by atleast the  differ- ence between 24,000 and the number  (if  any)  to be taken from the Naval quota.        .    ........      It is intended as  far  as possible  to  meet the  demand  of &quot;the Air Force  for 57,000  (or alternatively  for 42.700) men, by men  of lower category,  and by  lads under 18,8  and boys  under 18.    Thus, during April, I have  proposed an  allocation to the  Air  Force  of 6.000  recruits,  only  1,000  of whom  are  over the  age  of  18,8,  and fit for  General Service,    Eat  the  demand  of the Air Porce  is very large&quot;)v  for  skilled tradesmen;  and  it is almost  certain tnat  a  larger proportion of Grade 1 men will  have  to  be  allotted  in future months,      It may  be  possible  to  raise  a  certain number  of unskilled  men in Ireland by voluntary enlistment  for  the Air Force; and  it is pro- posed to run a  recruiting campaign  in Ireland  for  this purpose;  but there is livtle or  no prospect  of obtaining any skilled men  from this source-    Apart from this,  the  demand of the Air Force  can  only be met at the expense  of either the  Navy or the Army.
     In theso circumstances, the decision of the War Cabinet is askeJon:the following points(1)       Does the War Cabinet approve the Admiralty demand that the]        .  should receive their total requirement of&apos;64,00O, 26,000          being taken from Grade 1 men over the age of 18.8. and          the. balance from lad3 under 18,8. and boys under 18, and          the Air Force receiving 24,000 of the 50,000 Grade 1 men          originally allocated to the Navy and R.N.A.S-?          If not,&apos;(2)       What proportion, if any, 6f the 50,000 Grade 1 men for         - the Navy and R.N.A.S, is to-be allocated to the Air Force?!(3) -      Is the demand for 57,700 men^  (or alternatively for 42,70ol        ,  men) for the Air Force to be given priority over the Army          in allocating recruits as between the Army and the Air          Force.(4) ;      If the requirements of the Uaval Section of the, Air Force          are greater than the number which that section is ta.draw          from the Naval quota of 50,000 meni is the difference to          be made up out of recruits available for the Armyj and if          so, is the Air Force to have priority over the Army in          this respeefc?     I feel bound to inform the War Cabinet that the Admiralty havenow Issued instructions that not more than 10% of the quota, ofAdmiralty &quot;A&quot; Firms are to be released under the Munitions AreaRecruiting Scheme unless substitutes are provided.   The Admiraltyhad arrangGd with the Ministry of Munitions that 12,500 such menshould be released within 5 months.  . The cutting off of this supplj)will not only directly reduce the number of men available for theArmy by 12,SOD, but will also, if persisted in, lead to great diffi-culty In releasing men employed in similar occupations in Ministryof Munitions firms.     I am counting on a release from Admiralty, Munitions and WarOffice Contracts firms of 100,000 Grade 1 men, and any reduction inthis number must correspondingly reduce  the number of recruits;alIoicated to the Army.                            - /;20/5/18A.
