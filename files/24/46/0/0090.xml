In the North, Inspectors have met  with considerablesuccess by setting before the Local Authorities an allotment UThe object aimed at is to secure that  one in every three of allthe inhabited houses shall have an allotment.    This  result hasbeen obtained in certain of the smaller towns  of Yorkshire.   Jexample -    (1)  Keighley;  population 43,487, inhabited houses about4,348, total allotments 2,819, pre-war allotments  758,Cultivatiof Lands Order allotments 561, allotments being acquired this J1,500*  - One allotment for from one to two houses.            I    (li) Ossett:  population 14,078, inhabited houses about 3,1
total allotments 1,308, pre-war allotments 12, Cultivation ofLands Order allotments last year 296, nevi allotments now beingacquired 1,000.   One allotment for from one to two houses.          A striking example of the numbers of allotments in thelarger towns is provided by Eradford, of which the population is288,458, the number of inhabited houses about 64,000, and thenumber of allotments 6,629 (l.B. one allotment to ten houses).          At Leeds, where the population is 452,948, inhabitedhouses number about 100,000, total allotments 7,557 (one allotmentto about 13 houses).          In Yorkshire alone, the reports show that 1,600 acresof land, which has been visited by the  Inspectors, is being takenfor allotments by the Authorities,   Up to the present date the360 Urban Authorities already visited by the DepartmentfsInspectors, are taking steps to acquire 6,000 additional acres, whichgives an increase of 53^5 in the number  of allotments for thesedistricts.Allotments at Munition Y*orks,  Remarkable progress is being madeat the Works at Hayes,   The girls who  are working the plotshave already trenched and prepared upwards of 14 acres of groundfor cultivation.                      TECHNICAL DIVISION.          Several requests have recently been received fromthe War Office for advice in,the management of land occupied bythe military.          About 70 acres of land reclaimed from Ashdown Forest,which is being cultivated by men from the R.P.A, camp at ForestRow, Sussex has been inspected during the week.   About 18 acmes,,divided into plots, lie within the lines of the camp, theremainder consisting of three separate  blocks within the Forest.The land near the camp is difficult to  till, and obstacles suchas banks and hollows have had to be overcome.   The work has                         - 5 -  &quot;&apos;&apos;
the plots previously brought under cultivation,  look verypromising. :  The land selected for cultivation &quot;in the  Forest jmore or less clear of trees, but  is  largely  covered with lingand bracken.   The soil  is  loam,  thin  in places,  but dry,  v.it]the exception of a few isolated patches,  and ploughs up fairl;well.   The land is being broken  up  skilfully, and there is eireason to believe that good crops will be secured,Seed T e s t ing St at ion.    The number of  samples received up  toiMarch 23rd was 6,411,    The reports  sent out were 5)913. of v;i194 were interim.

In addition, 10,812 acres werecultivated,  The work performed was, therefore, equivalent to 10acres ploughed for every one of the 2,303 tractors in commission.Wiltshire.  The Salisbury unit ploughed 468i aores with 24tractors.  1,442 acres were ploughed in this county during the weekby 83 tractors.Norfolk. Another splendid result has been obtained by Pordsontractor No.563 having ploughed 46 acres in 44-1 hours on the low -  ------average fuel consumption of 1.84 gallons per acre,Hampshire.

SUPPLIES DIVISION.Sulphate of Ammonia - A Conference has been held with makers atwhich the prices for next season were discussed, and a basis pricesubject to a proportionate allowance to cover the anticipated risein the price of Sulphuric Acid, has been agreed upon between therepresentatives of the Ministry of Munitions and this Department,and the makers.   The contemplated increase In prices isnecessary in order to cover the present cost of manufacture, so as toenable the output of Sulphate of Ammonia to be fully maintained. Thequestion of the actual prices to be charged to farmers Is underconsideration.
          The draft of the proposed Order fixing  the prices ofSulphate of Ammonia which was considered by the Sulphate of AmmoDistribution Committee, has met with general approval.          In order to meet the demands of allotment-holderssuiof ammonia is now being sold at l/6d. per 7 lb. bag by  theMetropolitan and most of the Surburban Gas Companies around Lend        .  The attention of Executive Committees is being drawn tthe prizes which are offered by the Sulphate of Ammonia Associatto ,allotinent-hptlders and small farmers for crops  grown  on landdressed, with. Sulphate of Ammonia.Superphosphate - A Press Notice was Issued during the week drawlthe attention of farmers and allotment-holders to supplies ofsuperphosphate.   Numerous enquiziw have been received  from alloholders in the Metropolitan area, and.an effort is being made toarrange for the supply of this fertiliser in small quantities toallotment-holders.  The prices provided by the Order Issued lastyear were hardly sufficient to remunerate dealers for sellingsmall quantities of 14 lbs&apos;, or 28 lbs. but the Ministry of Munithave undertaken to Issue an amending Order at once allowingadditional charges for these quantities.Wire Netting - Several Agricultural Executive Committees are askfor supplies of wire netting, and stocks in the hands of severalmanufacturers are exhausted.   Pressure is being  brought on theMinistry of Munitions to release a further supply of steel forthis purpose, but at the moment the Army requirements are so grethat it appears unlikely that additional supplies can be obtaineSeed Oats. The supplies of Manx oats are now exhausted; suppliesof Scottish oats have been considerably reduced and steps are betaken to dispose of the remaining parcels.  The Department stillhave approximately 600 tons of Irish Black Tartarian oats eitherstore or on passage to meet future orders.10-

The total quantity of potatoes for which forwardinginstructions have been issued to growers up to the 23rd inat.amounts to 29,236 tons;  the total quantity delivered to consigneesin England and Wales amounts to 9,571 tons and the total quantityshipped to France is 6,319 tons, making a grand total of 15,890 tons.Wart Disease.  Inspectors have been asked, to suggest areas in theirdistricts which they think should be certified as Infected Areasunder the forthcoming Wart Disease of Potatoes Order.  It isproposed to define these areas and publish the neoessary particularsamongst those concerned at an early date, so that they may he awareof the requirements of the new Order in sufficient time to maketheir arrangements for the planting season of 1919.               .  ,.          A few new cases of wart disease have been reported andlocal enquiry is being made.Spraying.  The following number of lectures have been given by theOrganisers working under the Spraying Sub-Section:-          Up to the end of February           ...    415          During the first 26 days of March   ,..    410          Total to date        ...            ...    825          Arrangements have been made in many parts of the countryfor potato spraying trials and demonstrations to be carried outduring the summer under detailed supervision, and the co-operationof several University Agricultural Departments has been obtainedin regard to these.          A detailed record sheet for entering the results of thesetrials has been drawn up and printed copies are now beingdistributed to County Organisers and others. The information to beobtained by this means should prove to be of great value.          Several samples of seed potatoes suspected of diseasehave been reported on.Seed Control.  Inspectors1 reports show that the requirements ofthe Testing of Seeds Order are gradually being understood better,
and more closely followed by seedsmen, and complaints as to theterms of the Order are becoming less frequent.  The satisfactorymanner in which the Order is being complied with in certain distis to a large extent due to the interest taken by some firms whihave gone to considerable trouble in explaining the Order to thefellow seedsmen in the district.certain details which will need reconsideration at the close ofpresent season.Onion Seed.  The whole of the first consignment of Onion seed,amounting to rather more than one ton, which the Ministry of Fopurchased in the United States of America, and arranged with thiDepartment to distribute, has now been sold and delivered towholesale seed houses.America, and it is hoped that distribution will be effected intime for sowing this season.Seed Experts and Military Service.  Lists are being prepared ofthe men who will be certified by this Department as indispensablfor the carrying on of the Seed Trade in connection with therecent arrangement with the Ministry of National Service withregard to the exemption from military service of seed experts.The Order is working smoothly on the whole, but thereFurther consignments of Onion seed are now arriving frI am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt.
