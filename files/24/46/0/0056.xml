WAR   C A B I if 3 T.T. 4052*                                                      / a                          MAft-PCVSR OF IRSMB.                    Memorandum by the Chief Secretary.         There is in my opinion a substantial difference between thepossibilities of success of an extension to Ireland of the British lawof military service and those of a scheme of compulsory enrolment byballot for the purpose cf completing and maintaining the effectives ofthe 84 battalions forming ths nine Irish Regiments of the line.  Theformer will,  I believe, be likely to end the whole chapter of effortto establish concord between the two countries - unless it is accept-ed to get self-government,.  I agree with the expert advisers who pre-dict that it would consolidate into one mass of antagonism all theNationalist elements in Ireland, politicians, priests, men and women.I have grave doubts whether it would not even prevent sorious con-sideration of a system of self-government, if the two proposals weremade simultaneously, but the question of military service (as isessential) were given precedence.  As to this matter, however, I am notconfident.  I have the gravest possible apprehensions.  On the otherhand, the plan of limiting enrolment by the standard of the requirementsof Irish regiments, the gradual character of the process, its limitedapplication within defined classes of the young manhood of the country,and the chances of total escape of military service which the ballotwould give, are elements in the project-which seem to me (a) likely tobreak the fprco of national opposition, and (b)  to lessen the prospectof wholesale and combined resistance organised in advance.  The proposalin this Amending Bill which would be required for the introduction ofa ballot for recruits for the Irish Regiments would take some suchform as that which followsrEis Majesty may by Qrder in Council direct the raising in Ireland from&quot;time to time of such numbers of men as shall be required to complete&quot;and maintain tho effective strength of the following Regiments&quot;Irish Guards, Royal Irish Regiment, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers,&quot;Royal Irish Rifles, Royal Irish Fusiliers, Conneught Rangers, Leinster&quot;Regiment, Royal Munster Fusiliers, and Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the&quot;numbers of the men so to be raised to be apportioned among the cities,^towns and counties of Ireland as by Order in Council shall be from&quot;time to time directed and the selection-of the men so to be raised to&quot;be determined by ballot in the several areas in such manner and under&quot;such regulations as His Majesty by Order in Council shall from time to -:rtime direct&quot;.         I would add to this Bill another Clause dealing with the dangerof the existing Rebel Volunteer organisations.-  I recently had a draftBill prepared, the material Clause&quot;of which was in the form subjoined&quot;1*  (1)  Any adult male British subject ordinarily resident in Ireland&quot;who, at any time after the passing of this Act, acts as a member of any&quot;organisation formed for the Practice of military exercises, movements,&quot;or  drill, shall be deemed as&apos;from the appointed date to have been duly&quot;enlisted  in Eis Majesbyrs Regular Forces for general service with the&quot;&quot;Colours  or in the Reserve for the -period of the war and to have been&quot;forthwith, transferred to the Reserve, and, subject to the provisions of&quot;this Act, the Military Service Acts 1916 to 1910 shall extend to him in*Tlike manner as to a man to whom section  one of the Military Service Act1916 (Section 2] apolies&apos;.
(s)&quot;         For tho purposes of this Section a man shall be taken to&quot;act as a member of such organisation as aforesaid if, not being a&quot;member of His Majesty1s Haval or Military Forces, or a police con-&quot;stable,  or person duly authorised by the Lord Lieutenant in that&quot;behalf,  he          (a) practices, takes part, or is concerned in any exercise,              movement,  or drill of a military character, orfb)  uses or wears in a public    or military character, orplace any uniform of a navalpart of any such uniform,fand the  appointed  date  shall be  the day on which he does any of thePacts aforesaid&quot;.          It  seems to me  of such vital consequence with regard to thefuture  conditions of life in Great Britain and Ireland and the permanentrelations  of  the  two Islands to minimise possibilities of trouble inIreland during the present orisis that I attach extreme Importance tothe probable  difference  in the effect of two alternative methods ofprocedure  with regard to  man-power.          I attach a memorandum prepared by General Byrne of the Royalilrish Constabulary,  and assented to by General Sir Bryan IJahon, whichwas handed to me  shortly  before Iattended at the Cabinet to-day, asjexpressingballot.their considered opinion on the question of enrolment by(Sd)  E.

II&amp;iOaAHDUH BY BRIGALIsK Gii^aEkL BYRNE, COHCURj&amp;g)     IN BY LIEUTENANT GBNURAL BRYAN MaHON.  Notes on Scheme put forward &quot;by tho Chi of Secretaryfor bringing Irish Infantry Battalions up to War  Strengthby moans of the application of the Ballot, and of sub-sequently maintaining them at War Strength by the same means.1.    It is assumed that the scheme will only bo applied inconjunction with some form of Self-Govornment which will satisfymoderate Nationalist opinion.   Hoy/ far such form of Self-Governmont be likely to cause trouble amongst the extremeUnionists in the North and the extreme Sinn Eoinor?   This willhave a bearing on the success of the Scheme.2.    The Sinn Fain organisation will, I anticipate, put forv/ardevery effort to present tho Scheme being a success.   Theirpopularity will be greatly increased as practically all theyoung Catholic men in the country will join them..   The youngClergy will be bitterly hostile and tho older Clergy will becither hostile or neutral.   Moderate and better class opinionwill probably receive tho scheme favourably although until itssuccess is assured many will not have the courage to assist  it.3.    In my opinion therefore wo must be prepared to carry thescheme through in tho faith of almogt as much hostility fromthoso likely and able to cause trcublo as would be  onccnint&amp;red intho enforcement of general conscription.  It can only succeedprovided tho detailed arrangements aro drawn up with secrecy andefficiency and that, overwhelming force is displayed during theearly progress of the-measures dec Idea upon.   s-4.  .  It is to be realised that the scheme will practically  resultin  complete Irish Battalion of conscripts.    Do tho militaryauthorities consider that they &quot;can be relied on.    It may be urgedthat subsequent transfer may be affected but the difficulties of   .&quot;helcsale transfer  (which are contrary to tho spit if. of the  scheme;cannot be overlooked.   Is such a  transfer to be arbitrary or isit  to be the result ofiinvostigation  into individual cases wfsuspicion?5.    As to tho Ballot:             I anticipate passive  resistance;   I also foreseedifficulties in obtaining local co-operation from the country.Is  it to be dealt with  solely by the  Military (i.e. HeadquartersOf  Regimental Districts)  or by Military and Civil officialscombinedV  For tho  sake of  example  assume that  the  immediate quotareferred  from tho Co. Cork  for its Territorial  Battalion  (MunsterFusiliers) is 300 men,  assume that  there  are 1000 men of  SI  yearsof  ago  from whom it  is  decided to  take the qucta by Ballot - assumeJ.O.80  that  tho grout majority  of those 1000 mon  will refuse to obeyany summons  to  come  forward  for medical examination, or for  claimsfor exemption,  it  will  then  rest with tho County Cwmmittco toconduct the  Ballot  themselves,/; They  might be able  to deal withexemptions from Pvliec-  Reports Or  from  local knowledge but to allow for errors - medical  rejections -  they would probably have to callup  say,  tin extra 200  men.,   Than  assumu that tho great majority of                                                             the
the 500 mon so ocllod up refuse to attend at tho place, ofjceining, the;; will than huvo to ho rounded up by Police ap4&quot;&quot;military.  -This will give    he troublesome and give rlijorarto local disturbances.6.    The country would bo in such a disturberstato that in themajority of counties tho Police would have to/concentratedinto larger bodies;  this would impair thoir efficiency andnecessitate increased number of troops.7.    In conclusion, I am of opinion that in view of the graveemergency which requires additional men for the Army tho Schemeoutlined by the Chief Secretary is practicable.  It is onlypracticable however provided that no. half measures bo adopts d.$hat for the  initial stu&amp;is only tho County bo  flooded withtroops,  that  all prominent agitators be removed at onco, thatthe fress bo  put under drastic control, and that tho detailedarrangements  bo drawn up with  tho greatest  skill and foresight.If there be any flaw in any of tho above procautfeons, thatinstead of being a success it  will loud to  a deplorable state*f affairs In Ireland.      I assume that this Scheme will bo adequately  &quot;boomed&quot;  inevery way  by  the i?ross Propaganda Department.                        (Signed)     t/. Byrne.                                  27. 5. 18.H.B...  In spite of the difficulties sot forth above, this          Scheme would bo more likely to succeed than &amp;          Scheme of general conscription.
