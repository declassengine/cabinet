,T, 4073.WAR  CABIIET.100, Grosvenor Road,          Pimlico.Prime Minister:      After reading the Minutes of yesterday1s Cabinet, andconsidering all you were good enough &quot;to say to me on thesubject, I remain of opinion that Parliament should besummoned as soon as possible and the Military Service proposalsof the Government laid before it.  At present the country isunder the strong impression of the reverse in Prance, and willaccept anything the Government declares necessary.  If thingsgo badly at the front that opinion will be so intensifiedthat Parliament will have to be summoned.  If they gowell there will be a reaction and the many opponents of theproposals will gather strength.  In such a case I doubt ifanything like the proposals put forward by Sir AoGeddes couldbe carried into law - certainly conscription in Ireland wouldbe far more difficult, -As for the Irish situation, I admitI am not completely informed, and as far as I am informed Icannot pretend to admire the Cabinet1s Irish policy,  But Ibelieve its only chance of success would be to carry it withconscription by a rush as a war measure.  And that can onlybe done on the wave of intense feeling that now prevails,A declaration should be made at the same time as theannouncement of conscription in Ireland that certain proposalsI do not know what they are - have been laid by the Cabinetbefore the Convention, and in the event of the latter bodyapproving them they will be passed into law.                               (Signed)  ROBERT CECIL.March 30, 1918.
