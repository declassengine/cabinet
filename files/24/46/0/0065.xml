1MAJi FOR THE WAR CABINET.I circulate  herewith the Bill  which has beadrafted to carry out the recommendations made inChapter VIII of the Final Report of the DominionsRoyal Commission (Oct. 8462) and in the Report of theEmpire Settlement Committee (Cd. 8672).          The details of the Bill have been consideredby an Interdepartmental Conference consisting ofrepresentatives of the home Office, Colonial Office,Board of Trade, War Office, Local Government Board,Board of Agriculture and Ministry of Labour with theParliamentary Counsel, under the&apos; Chairmanship ofl r. Hewins.          It has two main objects.     1.   To constitute a Central Authority which willhave certain executive powers in connection withemigration from the United Kingdom.     2.   to control those who are in any way concernedwith the oale of passages to emigrants or engaged inemigration work.          As regards the first of these objects,  it  isproposed that the Central Authority should be constituton the lines recommended by the Empire SettlementCommittee, and that the Secretary of State for theColonies should be Chairman,   It nay be necessary toappoint a paid Vice Chairman,  while the members arelikely to be representatives of the various Government                                           Departments
Departments interested, the four High Commissioners  andtwo of the Agents General, and a limited number ofUnofficial members of whom one or more will bo ladies.The Authority will thus represent all parts of theEmpire especially concerned with migration.          As. regards the control of those engaged in thesale of passages to emigrants and those engaged inemigration work, the Bill provides for much more atriii-gent supervision than that now existing.-   The Reportof the Dominions Royal Commission sets out in detail thereasons necessitating such supervision and it wouldappear that public opinion is,-generally speaking, infavour of the measures now proposed, though consider-able opposition may be expected from the vested interestsaffected.          The proposed legislation will not,- of course,take full effect until the war is over and it is, in themain, a measure of reconstruction.   It is thoughtessential however to obtain the necessary powers ofcontrol during the war., so that preliminary action maybe taken.   The Bill is now submitted for&quot; the approvalcf the War Cabinet, with a view to itc introductioninto Parliament as soon as opportunity can be found.COLONIAL OFFICE.W.H.L.   27. 3, 18;
