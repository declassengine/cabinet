421*           0CMMME5 ON THE TRADE RELATIONS  OF                /,3.1918.         &quot;jBti miT&amp;O KEflGKUUM WITHIN THE                    /MG.                       EMPIRE,             SECOND REPORT ON RAW MATERIALS.1,     We have prepared, with the help of the Departmentsconcerned    two lists (see Appendix A), showing:-         (a)    Those raw materials, produced in the Empire, which-;^r^rvv*s Prima facie desirable to control for the &apos;JlJ. -:.;;;&apos;?&apos;;     &quot;benefit of the United Kingdom, of other manufaotur-      &quot;&quot;&amp;v&apos;: :%   *nS centres in the Empire, and of the Allies,  rr     (b)     Those which might be utilised in bargaining, with      f&quot;s^5-^    our present enemies, or with Allies, for economio  ii -^S^     or political concessions.       The two lists overlap, but they are not identical.  It would    be easy to add to them;  but we are opposed to interfering more    than is unavoidable with the normal oourse of Empire trade. We    suggest that the lists should be telegraphed to the Dominions    and India, with an explanation that they are provisional lists,&apos;    and are only submitted as a basis for discussion.       We have also prepared a third list, of the materials for   -supplies of which we may be obliged to bargain with foreign    powers (see Appendix A).  This also might be communicated to    the Dominions and India for their information.       The Foreign Office are making enquiries as to the exaot    needs of our Allies in respect of Empire raw materials.  The    Board of Trade is preparing statistical estimates of the needs    of the United Kingdom.  This information will be available by    the time of the Conference.  We attaoh a schedule(Appendix  B)    of the heads under which the information is to be collected.       We look to the cooperation of the Board of Trade and the    Foreign Office in investigating the uses which may be made of    the  &quot;bargaining counters&quot; enumerated in the second list.IE.     We suggest that  the Imperial War Conferenoe should be asked    to approve, in general terms, the principle of reserving speaifi    supplies of certain raw materials for the United Kingdom and the    Allies;  and also to agree to a list of tiife raw materials which
it is desirable to control for this purpose.   But we recognise that each Dominion  (and India) must hemistress in her own house, and must be  left to decide, in res-pect of each of the raw materials which she produces, whethershe will control it, how she will control it, and for whosebenefit she will exercise her control.   We therefore deprecate the idea of pressing the Dominions(or India) to adopt a cut and dried system of control, devisedin this country without, regard to their local interests andcircumstances.   We hope that ELM. Government after seating,.the&apos;needs of the United Kingdom and the Allies, will merely ask theDominions (and India) how far eaoh of them can give assistance.We do not anticipate that the Governments of the Empire will beat a loss for methods of control.   We  are struck by the varietyand the efficiency of the methods which some of them have devis-ed during the war.  We understand that  all of them have somemachinery which could be utilised for post-bellum control. Thereis no good reason for insisting upon mechanical uniformity ofadministration, as long as the object in view is achieved.  Thatobject is to ensure definite quotas of  specified raw materials forthe United Kingdom and for certain of the Allies and (it may be)for bargains with our present enemies.   After the Conference has approved the principle of control,the objects of control (as defined in our First Report) andthe list of materials to be controlled,  there will be need fordetailed negotiations,  in respect of each of the listed materialsparticularly as to the  amounts to be reserved for the UnitedKingdom and the Allies, and as to the terms of purchase.   Therewill be negotiations on the part of the  Dominions and India:-                  (a) : with the United Kingdom                  (b)  with certain of  the Allies.
   These negotiations cannot well he conducted in the mainConference.   We hope that the Dominions and India will appointspecial delegates (who should he of ministerial status) tonegotiate on their behalf.   Seeing that at least half adozen Departments in this country will be interested in thenegotiations we suggest that a Committee of the Ministerialheads of these Departments should be set up, with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies as its chairman, and should be empowered:-            (a)  to make binding arrangements, on behalf of                 the United Kingdom, with the representatives                 of the Dominions and India, in respect of                 raw materials:            (b)  to call for all the expert assistance (from                 Departments and specialist Committees) which,                 it may require for the adequate performance .                 of its duties,,    Such a Committee would no doubt be well qualified tofacilitate discussions and arrangements regarding raw materialsbetween o&apos;ur Allies and the Dominions and India.
