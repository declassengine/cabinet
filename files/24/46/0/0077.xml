KEPORT relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for          Scotland for the week ending 27th March 1918.T.__POOD PRODUCTION.    With the exception  of  slight  spells  of night  frost  in some  districts, which  interfered to seme  extent with  ploughing operations,  the  weather conditions were satisfactory during  the  past week.  Seeding is well advanced.for the time  of year.    1.  Labour   The men released  from the Army as skilled agricultural  labcurers^nave not in  many instances come up to  the  standard required  of skilled ploughmen in Scotland.    Further efforts  are  being  made  with a view to securing the release  for the remainder  of the plough-  ting season of at least 300 men  who  have had experience  of ploughing  on Scottish farms.    2*  .0ompulscry  Orders J.ssued under Defence of  the  Realm. Regulation. 2M  During the week the Board issued Orders in the following cases:-    ^Ipjtipil         Farm or^Lands    (1) (a)     Castlerigg  Grass Parks.        Wigtown    (1) (e)     Gedloeh                        Elgin    (lj (e)     Castle Praser Home Parm        Aberdeen    fl) fa)    .

Prom information received  by the Board  it would&quot;&quot;seem tliat caVbage plants distributed by a merchant in  Edinburgh are infested with the  larvae  of the Turnip Gall \7eevil.  A number of specimens  submitted  to the  Board were severely affected  and  there is reason to believe that  similar plants in  corridorable  numbers are being sold to allotment  holders in Edinburgh and olse-  :where.      The presence  of the weevil is shown by rounded growths, at or  near the roots of the  plants, which  resemble in  appearance the  growths oaused by finger  and toe disease.    In the cuss  of finger  and  toe a soil fungus  is  responsible for the malformation of the  root but in the case of an attack by the weevil  the  growths aro  definite galls formed  by  its larvae.      The introduction of this pest into  ground where  cabbages and  Similar plants are grown  from year to  year i3 serious  in respect  that if the weevils multiply to  any  extant it may eventually become  impossible to raise a  satisfactory crop.    Plants attacked by  bho  weevil make little headway and scarcely ever reach full  grov/th.      The Board have issued a notice to  the Press  advising occupiers  of gardens and allotments to examine their cabbage plants before  planting/
 planting and to  submit  specimens  with, abnormally shaped roots for examination.   Leaflets  on the  subjects     I      ,   c   of &quot;Turnip  Grail Weevil&quot;  and &quot;Finger  and Toe&quot; will  be supplied  free, on application to  the Board.                          &quot;           it   4,   Seed Potatoes.    As the  planting of potatoes will  become faixl^general in  Scotland within the next few  weeks  the Board are again  reminding  growers of the need for examining their  seed with a  view to ensuring that only sound  tubers are planted.    Within the  last few weeks, specimen potatoes severely  affected  with Coricy Scab have been sent to  the Board  for examination.   The  source of supply of these potatoes  has been traced  and the distributors ? prohibited from  sending out  further quantities  drawn  from the same stock.     A notice  has been issued to the Press warning Allotment  Holders especially of the  danger  of  introducing this disease  into their  I ground.   It  has been proved that in the case of ground  where a  \ potato orop  is raised year after  year.  Corky Scab,  if introduced,- may become as destructive  In its  effects as  Wart Disease.  Allotment Holders have  therefore  been urged to examine their stock of  seed before planting and to  submit  specimens of suspected  tubers  for examination by the Board1 s experts.     In the same Press Notice the  attention of growers has again been drawn to the  dangers  of planting potatoes  affected with Tfart Disease.   5*  Wart Disease    In the early part  of the year  the occupiers of gardens and other holdings  affected  with  Wart Disease were notified that  under the Order  they  could .only plant Immune Varieties seleoted by the  Board.    A very large number of applica- :tions for licences have been  received  and about  650  licences have been issued to date.     This number  does  not  include the licences issued by the  local Inspectors  in Perthshire and Fifeshire.   6,  Transport Facilities   Agricultural  traffic  on  the railways is perhaps heavier in the  Spring  than at any other season of the- year.  The Board have received numerous  complaints from farmers - of delay in obtaining supplies  of sacks, waggons and  sheets, and, in some cases  of the  refusal of the Railway  Officials to acceptagricultural produce  for certain  destinations.    Manure merchants, agricultural engineers and other  traders supplying articles foruse on farms have also made similar representations.   All these complaints have been communicated to  the Companies concerned who; the 3oard are glad to be able to report, have endeavoured torectify matters so far as the existing congestion on  the railwaysand the depleted state of their staffs would permit,II.   LAND SETTLEMENT  SCEBMBS  FOR SOLDIERS MB SAILORS      ll   Sariochsford (Aberdeenehire)   The  estate  of Gariochsford    situated in the Counties  of4 Aberdeen and 3anff  and 31 miles from    the City of Aberdeen  has  been presented  by Mr John Brown  of    Redhall,  Kincardineshire  to H.M. Government for the purpose of    forming  a land  settlement for Soldiers and Sailors.  Tho  only    condition attached to the gift is that the settlers shall be    natives  of the  County of  Aberdeen in which Mr Brown was born and    has spent his business life.   .The Board,  acting with the approval    of the Secretary  for  Scotland,  have  accepted the gift and have    conveyed/2.

The farm extends  to 644 acres including 603 acres ofexcellent arable land situated in one of the most fertiledistricts of  Scotland.  The gross annual value of the propertyis  663.
