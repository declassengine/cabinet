DELHI,Sir,                                              21st December 1917.       We have the honour to-acknowledge the receipt of your predecessorsSecret Despatch No. 13, dated the 20th April 1917, inviting our criticisms orsuggestions  on the report of the Snb-Oommittee appointed by the PrimeMinister to consider the question of the arms traffic after the war.   2. We have read  the  Sub-Committee&apos;s  report  with deep interest andmuch profit.  We are at one with them  in viewing  the  danger of a widelyextended arms traffic as a result of  the war with grave concern, and have  nohesitation in endorsing the general tenor of their recommendations regardingthe manner in which that danger should he faced.   3. In particular  wre  endorse  their  recommendation  that  the wholequestion  of  the  future control  of  the arms traffic should be  raised at thePeace  Conference  as a high  moral issue, and that  a  strenuous  endeavoursbould be made to negotiate an  International Convention on the  lines  theysuggest.  But like them we are under no illusions as to the permanent valueof any International Convention, however skilfully framed, unless it is backedby the sanction  either of self-interest or the reprobation of  the civilisedworld.  In the arms traffic the interests of the different Powers, where theydo not directly conflict, are so unequally divided and in the nature of thingsso liable to change with territorial and other  international readjustments, thatalthough it  is doubtless  a wise instinct to enlist the powerful aid of self-interest wherever possible, it seems Utopian to hope to find the final solutionto the problem in any elaborate balancing of interests.   It may seem  moreUtopian still to seek it in the awakening of the  civilised conscience; but ifthis most difficult problem admits of any permanent solution at  all, it is onlyhere that it is to he found.   1. Moreover, the success that attended  the campaign against the abolitionof slavery in the last century encourages the hope that it  is not altogethervisionary to look for success from a  camj)aign for  the abolition of thisiniquitous trafficking in arms among uncivilised peoples.  Never  before,perhaps, has the time been so ripe for such a campaign.   The war is alreadyand increasingly stirring the conscience of the w&apos;orld to its depths :  it is notmerely that the horrors of  Avar are  imprinting themselves on the world  ; the.moral sense of the world  is being kindled by the high  moral issues wrhichthe Allies have proclaimed as their goal;  and in the reaction that will set inwhen peace  is at last declared, not the least powerful or enduring of theemotions dominating the world will be, we cannot but hope, an abhorrence ofany  removable cause calculated to lead to a renewal of bloodshed and apassionate desire to uproot it.   If  this be true, then the impelling need ofthe moment  is to bring the world to a full consciousness of the evils wroughtby this arms traffic among savage and  semi-savage peoples and of the greatclanger to which it  exposes the peace of the world.   We earnestly urge,therefore, that no time should be lost &quot;in inaugurating a widespread campaignagainst it, in an  endeavour to rouse so great a volume of public  opinion inall  civilised  countries as shall render  it  impossible  for any civilisedGovernment to connive at  or tolerate it.

    5. Rut it would be manifestly premature  to rely on this alone, and wecordially endorse  the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation that we  should  inthe first instance seek to secure  a  separate understanding with.France witha  view to  ensuring her  sincere  co-operation  in  any restrictive  measuresarrived at by international agreement.   Like the Sub-Committee, we  recog-nise in Jibouti the chief crux of this aspect of  the problem.   To India thismatter.is clearly of serious importance.  For though it is a far cry from  theNorth-West Frontier  or Afghanistan to Jibouti, Pathan and Afghan  makelight of distances  where  arms are to  be got,  and, baulked  of arms  in thePersian Gulf, both will almost inevitably seek them in Arabia, which inturn will draw them from Jibouti, so long as the Jibouti traffic  exists.   Wetrust, therefore, that it will prove possible to induce France to cede Jibouti toGreat Britain, and we agree with the Sub-Committee that the issues at stakeare so vital that  His Majesty&apos;s Government would be justified in making-heavy sacrifices to secure the desired result.  Indeed so vital  are  they, thatin the not unlikely event of France&apos;s refusal  except on terms  impossible forus to grant,  it seems  to us  worth  considering  whether it would not  bepossible to cede to her a substantial part  of Somaliland,  thus  making adirect appeal to  her self-interest in  the stoppage  of  the  arms - traffic  byproviding  her with a hinterland the security of which she could  not  affordto jeopardise.    G.  Of  the&apos;feasibility of this suggestion, which is put forward with  muchdiffidence and which is  partly prompted  by the  fact that the rendition ofsome part of Somaliland to Itahy has recently been under consideration, weare of course not in a  position to judge.   Were such a solution actual I vfeasible, however,  it would obviously have  the additional merit  of enablingus to pose  in a generous light towards  France and to ask her in  return toabrogate the troublesome Anglo-French Declaration of 18C2 and to withdrawfinally from relations with Maskat, which  amour propre might  otherwisemake  it difficult for her to do.   Once France were eliminated from Maskat,the control of the  arms  traffic in the Persian Gulf would become in name  aswell as in fact the exclusive task of Great Britain,  and  would  thus disappearaltogether  from the  scope of  international conventions.   With  France&apos;selimination from Maskat, moreover, there would be little difficulty, as far ascan  be  foreseen,  in carrying  out the  two  subsidiary  recommendationsregarding  Maskat. put forward  by the  Sub-Committee viz., that the  Sultanshould be induced, first, to place his Customs and arms warehouse  underBritish control, and, secondly, to raise  and  maintain  under British control apermanent armed force.  Both suggestions have long been  mooted, and arenow being considered  afresh  in  connection with a  review of the Maskatsituation just received from the Political Agent.  Such  are the financial andpolitical straits to,which the Sultan is  reduced, that  the only obstacle  (other than of a purely financial character) likely  to be  encountered is that  which would be afforded by French susceptibilities.     7. We share the Sub-Committee&apos;s  misgivings that post-helium  conditions will not be such as to warrant  any considerable relaxation of the preventive measures exercised  in  the  Persian Gulf before the war, and we  agree that the naval patrol  should be re-established, as soon as circumstances permit. and maintained until the efficacy  of any new  agreements or arrangements can  be  properly gauged.   At the   same  time we  are doubtful of  the expediency of  their  recommendation  that a British officer  should he per- manently  stationed at or near Debai.  The presence of a British officer on the Pirate Coast could hardly fail to act  as an  irritant  on the  Trucial Shiekhs and tribesmen  and arouse their suspicions regarding our intentions, and  we should prefer not. to resort to this  measure until the need for it is actually demonstrated.    S. We share the Sub-Committee&apos;s views on the importance of maintain- ing a close and contimious watch over  the routes by which arms have reachedthe North-West Frontier and Afghanistan in the past.   For even though thearms traffic in the Gulf be suppressed and  the potential supply from Jiboutibe cut off,  the war has resulted in so great an influx of arms into Mesopotamia
and Arabia generally tliat a considerable surplus will almost inevitably seekexport along these routes under the pressure of high profits.   In counter-ing  this  difficulty we  shall  doubtless receive  the  co-operation of theMesopotamia!! administration.  Within Persia itself we  shall be able to relyon the South Persia Rifles ;  while if&quot; our recent recommendations regardingthe futirre of Persian Baluchistan, including the Sarhad, eventually materialise,the means at our disposal for the  suppression of  the  arms  traffic throughPersia should be greatly strengthened.   The fact, however,  must be  facedthat  the  more  effectively we  suppress  the traffic  in  our  own  sphere  ofinfluence, the greater  will be  the clanger of  arms draining to the frontierand  Afghanistan from Russia  and  Northern  Persia  where our influencecannot reach..   9. As  regards  China  and  Japan,  we  should  welcome any  diplomaticaction that might tend to minimise  the danger of arms flowing  into Indiafrom  these  quarters.   But we  feel with the  Sub-Committee that the onlysatisfactory solution of  the problem  in  the case of both, and indeed of theFar East generally, will be to rely on our own resources to intercept smugglingand to put it down by  heavy  penalties.   10. The purely Indian aspect of the problem has been engaging ourearnest attention for some time, and a  tightening up  of our  Indian  ArmsRules to provide for a  closer  control over the  possession of firearms, and  ofrevolvers  and  automatic pistols  in   particular,  is under consideration.Regarding the question of the traffic in the French Settlements in India, weare addressing you separately.   11. In the  foregoing remarks,  we  have  not taken  into, account thepossibility of Russian territory  becoming a serious element in the case.  Theconditions there are too chaotic to admit at present of  any useful forecast ofsuch  a possibility or of any suggestions as to the best way of dealing with  it,should it arise.  But His Majestjds Government will doubtless bear thisaspect of  the matter in mind.                                              We have, &amp;c,                                          (Signed)     W.  S. MEYER.                                                      C. 11.  A.
