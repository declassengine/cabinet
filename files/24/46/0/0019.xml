     10 De Havilland 4s., left at 10,35 aftm. to bomb the Badische-Aniline und Soda-Ps.brik at Mannheim,  One machine was forced toreturn almost at once with engine trouble.  The remainder of theformation crossed the lines East of Luneville and flew acrossthe Vosges near Bitche, N.W. of Landau, over Neustadt and bombedthe target from the N,W. at 12,40 p.m.     Bombs were dropped as under from an average height of 13,500feet,             18  112 lb,             10   25 lb,              2   40 lb. (phos.)   TOTAL  2,346 lbs.     As a result bursts were seen as follows :-8 in the Badische-Aniline und Soda-Fabrik, causing a huge cloudof black and white smoke to ascends4 on the Docks,1 on and 1 alongside the Sulzer Factory, and many others roundthe objective.     Over the objective our formations were attacked by twoformations of enemy aircraft, one of 8 machines and one of 6machineso  They were mostly Albatros Scouts, DI &amp; D3 type, someof them being painted red and ethers with green main planes andblue tails; most were &quot;v&quot; strut type,     A combat ensued in which our pilots fired a total of 1940rounds..  As a result 2 enemy aircraft were sent down completelyout of control.  As there was a certain amount of mist and ourpilots were busily engaged fighting, these machines were notactually seen to crash, but they were followed down for 5,000feet and were then still completely out of control, and theImpression of pilots is that there is not much doubt as to theirultimate fate.     All our machines returned safely, the formations recrossingthe lines West of Luneville at 15,500 feet and landing at 2,30 p-nu    . A total of 36 plates were exposed with good results.     Anti-aircraft fire over the objective was slight comparedwith the last visit to Mannheim,  This, however, may have beendue to the presence of enemy machines.  One of our machines wasdamaged in the tail plane by anti-aircraft fire, and was wreckedon landing; personnel, however, being uninjured,     The weather was clear overhead with a certain amount oflight cloud and ground haze,                        (Sd.)
