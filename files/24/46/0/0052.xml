This DocumsrrWs the Property of142His Britannic &amp;fajecty&apos;s Government.)MM lufreffiM^ol1&quot;WDRSRSIand.CIVILIAN T ABIC RATIONS-Memorandum by the  Army  Councilin reply toMemoranda by Sir A. Mond and LordRhonddstT dated&apos; 1st and 20th March,1916, respectively, G.T.3790  andG.T.3905.      The Memoranda submitted by Sir A.Mond and Lord Rhcnddataken together raise five main issues1.  The sufficiency or otherwise of the civilian meat ration.2.  A further reduction in the Home Service Scale of Rations,  on    the ground that it is in excess of the scale allowed to the    civil population.3.  Differentiation in scales between various classes of Troops    at Home.                                                 t4.  A further reduction in the rations of certain Troops in the    Field.5.  The utilization for the civil population of Army Reserves  of    Me at.Taking the points seriatim :-1.  The Army Council have no  remarks beyond observing that Lord    Rhondda does not agree with Sir Alfred Mond.2 and 3.
2. and 3.  Tho proposed reduction of the Eome Service scale, as    well as tho question of differentiation &quot;by classes, has    already &quot;been dealt with comprehensively in the reply of the    Army Council to Mr-Austen ChamberlainTs ifemorandum&apos; G6T.3990r    It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the arguments here.40  About a year ago,  in addition to a series of reductions by    items which had been affected from time to time, it was    decided te differentiate between Troops on tho lines of    Communication and Troops at the Irmt,    Two scales were    adopted involving a material fi.ecrea.se in the ration of the    former class of Troops.          in the representations of the Army Council these two    scales have recently been further considered, and    recommendations have now been received from the Meld Msr&amp;hal    Commanding-in-Chief,          The proposed reductions in meat: and bacon are    considerables but they involve the introduction of substitutes    some ef which it may bo difficult for the Food Ministry to    obtain, eag0, butter and cereals.   The approval of the Army    Council will depend on the possibility of providing the    substitute6.  In their Memoranda Sir A,2 ond and lord Rhonlda advocate the    utilization of the Army Reserves of moat to tide ever what    thoy uonsider the critical period.   The effect of such a    meaaure would merely amount to making the position of the    civil population easier at the expense of the Army, and    making tho p&amp;riod a critical one for the Army instead of for                                                            lord
    lord Rhondda.          Army stocks at the present moment stand at 36,000 tons.    In May they will have dwindled tc 18,000 tons - this figure    makes no allowance whatever for probable losses at sc-a or    delays in shipping.   A Reserve of 18,000 tons for the Army    is a dangerously low one,  and lord Rhondda has in two recent    Memoranda j   1.3049 and G-.T.4000, advocated the principle of    adequate reserves being kopt under Army Control.    Bat that in May the Reserve will stand even at this figure    is solely due to the J&amp;xmy having been ablo to acquire in the    Autumn of 1917  20,000 tons of Home-killed meat.   Had this    not been available Irmy stocks in May would have shewn a    deficit of 2,000ttons, and the Army would have been without    meat for a considerable period.      In view of this position the irmy Council Regard theproposals to utilize the Army Meat Reserve for the civilpopulation with the gravest apprehension as certain to jeopardizethe continuity of supply te tho Troops.25th March, 1910.
