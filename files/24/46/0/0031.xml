HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1 S GQVE^NLONT,,SECRET.&apos;      &apos;                        MR CABINET.5.T.-4050.                  TROOPS AVAILABLE FOR H0M3 DEFENCE.              - Oopy of letter from the Field-Marshal         Commanding-in-Chief, Hone Forces&quot;, to Secretary,                              -&apos;rar Cabinet,                                       General  Headquarters,                                            Home  Forces,                                             Horse  Guards,                                                 London,  S.7r.l.                                                  25th Maroh,1918.Sir,       As  I think  it  right  that  the  \?ar  Cabinet  should  distinctlyunderstand the Military situation which  will exist  in the UnitedKingdom after.the  present demands have been met,  I  have  laid  thematter before the  Secretary of State who directed me  to  submit  thismemorandum for the  information of the  T7ar Cabinet.       I do not mean  to  question these demands although  theypractically denude  the  troops available  for Home Defence of  allfighting personnel, but  as  a  certain risk to the safety  of thisCountry and Empire  is involved,  I wish to make it clear  that  thatrisk will  exist and will have to be  taken into calculation.       My  system of defence for  the  United Kingdom  is based  on  theprinciple  of fighting the enemy  on tho coast and  preventing hislanding, or should he succeed in doing so,  of  holding him as  near tothe coast  as possible,  and  delaying  his  advance  until the variousMobile Formations at  my disposal could be brought up  as  reinforcements       Under present  oincumstances,  those portions  of the EasternCoast of the United Kingdom suitable for hostile  landings are heldby the 7 Mixed Brigades  in  the Eastern Command area,  8 CyclistBattalions and certain  draft finding Reserve formations  in theNorthern Command, 4 Cyclist Battalions and  Reserve  formations inthe Scottish Command.    Behind these there  are available 3 CyclistBrigades in the Eastern  Command  area, 2  Cyclist  Brigades in each ofth^ Northern and Scottish Commands.   In addition to  these, therear*v the Cyclist Division in Kent,  3  Home Service  Divisions in EastAa*glia and the 69th Division in  the  Northern Command,       Finally, there were  at my disposal improvised  formationsfrom troops under training which  were utilised  under various emergencyschemes.       The present total strength of tho 7  Mixed  Brigades is 30,COOfrom whom,  it is now proposed to  take 12,000, replacing these bymen of Category &quot;Bii&quot;.   These will  not  be  fully  trained.  TheCyclist Brigades havo s  present  strength of 26,000, from whori 4,000men of Category &quot;Ai&quot;  are to be taken, and  in addition 7,200 men  ofCategory 31&quot;.
       Of the Cyclist Battalions,, the&quot;&quot;&quot;present strength, is 11,000from whom it is proposed to take 740 men of Category &quot;Ai&quot; and4,500 men of Category &quot;Bi&quot;.   The &quot;Ai&quot; men are to he replaced by&quot;Aiv&quot; boys under 18-1 years who have had four months training.       The &quot;Bi&quot; men in Cyclist units are to bo replaced by &quot;Aiv&quot;boys of less than four months training.       In the case of Cyclist Units, none of this personnel willhave had previous Cyclist training.       The present fighting strength of Home Service divistions is43,000 which will be reduced to 10,000 after the available &quot;Aiv&quot;personnel of 18-^ years with four months training have been withdrawn^       These last cannot at present be replaced and in consequencethe 4 Home Service Divisions practically disappear with the exceptionof the permanent cadre.   In addition, 30,000 &quot;Aiv&quot; personnel isbeing drafted from Regular and T,F. Reserves, which will depletethe improvised formations under emergency schemes upon which I havebeen able to rely in the past,       As regards Ireland, I am strongly of opinion that it will notbe safe to reduce the strength of the present Garrison and I thinkalso that some Reserves should remain on this side of the Channelupon which I could rely in emergency.       The prsernt fighting strength of all troops in Ireland is25,000 men, which will be reduced by 3t834 men of Category &quot;Ai&quot;,1,100 of these will be withdrawn from the 2 Cyclist Brigades and winbe replaced by the &quot;Aiv&quot; boys who will not have had any training asCyclists.       In view of the present situation in Ireland, I thereforerecommend that the present Cyclist Division in England should remainintact.   This will be some small and efficient nucleus towardshelping Homo Defence and will provide a Reserve for despatch toIreland,  if necessary, and justify us in talcing the risk of replacingthe 1,100 highly trained Cyclists in Ireland by &quot;Aiv&quot; youths.                   I have the honour to be,                           Sir,                      Your obedient Servant,                             (Signed)  FRENCH.                 Field Marshal Commending-in-Chief,                                    Home Forces.
