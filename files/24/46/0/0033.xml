Arm,&apos; This Docurnent is the Property of     107H;s  Britannic  Majesty^ Government.)                                                /    MEMORANDUM ON THE GLYCERINE POSITION,  1918, BY THE                        MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS.    1.  Stocks  of glycerine in this country at the 1st January, 1918, amounted to12,800 tons.    2.  Requirements for 1918 amount to a minimum of:       Cordite (1,000 tons per week R.D.B.)...   13,500 tons crude glycerine.      Blasting (home)    ...        ...      ...    1,800      Blasting (South Africa)     ...      ...    5;500        ,&apos;,      Special  Government requirements    ...    1,050   ,,    ,,      ,,      Industrial requirements    ...      ...     190   ,,    ,,Total minimum requirement ...  22,040     In view of the probable shortage, it is suggested that Canada might draw onU.S.A. for the unfilled balance of their requirements, if any.     3.  (a.) Supplies are almost wholly dependent upon the output of the soap andcandle trades, which rely upon imports of oils, seeds,  and fats to keep their plantsemployed, and are, therefore, in direct competition with margarine production.     Other sources of supply are France,  Italy, and Holland,  but  the quantity ofglycerine to be obtained from these countries during 1918 is not likely to amount tomore than  1,200 tons.     The Shipping Controllers  full allocation of 1,400,000 tons  per annum for oils,seeds, and fats represents in oil values 630,000 tons, which allows :        380,000 tons for margarine, including a margin for other trades and cooking                 purposes.       250,000 tons for the soap and candle-makers.     The 250;000  tons are sufficient to keep the glycerine-producing  plants  fullyemployed, and should yield 25,000 tons of glycerine,  or more than ample to meetrequirements this year and  enable us to carry forward several  months&apos; stocks into1919.     (b.) Since the transfer  of responsibility for oils,  seeds,  and  fats from  thisMinistry to the Oils and  Fats Control under the Ministry of Food, imports havedeclined to an alarming extent.   Whereas  the full tonnage  was allotted to  thesematerials during the first half of 1917, only 73 per cent,  of the full allocation maturedduring the third quarter of last year, and only 65 per cent, during the last quarter.     The Ministry of Food have stated definitely that in  the event of a shortagemargarine  would  be given  the  preference over glycerine,  and  latest  indicationssuggest that, so far from obtaining an output of 25,000 tons of glycerine during thecurrent year., it is doubtful whether the soap and candle trades will receive sufficientsupplies to produce 14,000  tons.     4. The position, therefore, may be summarised as follows :-       Stock at Januarv 1. 1918  ...       .........12,800 tons.      Production during 1918 (maximum)    ...  14,000  tons      Imports during 1918 (maximum)      ...   1,200   ,,         1           &amp;                           -  15,200 ,,            Available supplies, 1918    ...       ...           28,000            Requirement during 1918 (minimum)  ...       ...  22,040 ,,Stock at January 1, 1919 (maximum)  ...      ...   5,960    5  The position, however, at the beginning of 1919 will be less satisfactory thanappears from the above figures, as a stock of 5,960 tons is equivalent to only some
eight to nine weeks&apos; consumption on the basis of the probable 1919 programme, whenthe requirement for propulsive explosives is likely to be considerably in excess of the1.918 scale.    This is due to the fact that the propellant demand this year is being partly metfrom stock,  with the result that propellant stocks will be reduced at the end of 1918,and a considerably increased production necessitated during 1919.    A summary of the probable 1919 position gives the following :        Stock at January 1, 1919  ...       ...       ...       ...    5,960 tons.       Maximum output during 1919 of soap and candle trade,           if fully supplied with materials        ...       ...   25,000                                                        30,960Requirement during 1919  ...       ...       ...      say   35,000                   Deficit...       ...       ...       ...    4,040     6. In view of the general position, and in order to economise tonnage, proposals are on foot to establish fat-splitting plants in India, Ceylon, and elsewhere, but none of these are likely to materialise or start producing in time to help the position  in the early months of 1919 materially.     7. It is therefore submitted :      (a.)  That an immediate decision be given to push on with the installation  of the fat-splitting plants referred to above.     (b.)  That the Shipping Controller be asked to state to what extent the shipping space allocated to the Ministry of Food for the current year is likely to materialise.     (c.)  That the Minister of Food be asked to undertake  that, in  the event of any reduction in the tonnage allocated to him, the import of oils, seeds, and fats shall not suffer out of proportion.     (d.)  That, in any  case, sufficient materials be given to the soap  and candle- makers,  even at the expense of margarine, to ensure  a  glycerine output of not less than 14,000 tons during 1918.     (e.)  That even this figure will only suffice to meet the bare requirements of 1918, and that every effort should be made to increase it substantially in view of the serious condition disclosed for 1919 (even assuming that 25,000 tons are obtained, and that is extremely unlikely), and the fact that the weekly requirement will rise immediately from about  430 tons of glycerine a week to about 675 tons  a week,  the latter figure being about 200 tons in excess of the maximum capacity of this  country.     It is, therefore, of  paramount importance to carry substantial stocks into  1919,to guard against failure or delay in output from the proposed  fat-splitting plants abroad.     (/.) That the use in  this country of  oils  which are  capable  of being  de-glycinerated be at once restricted to glycerine-producing  processes;  for  example,there seems  no good reason for continuing supplies of linseed oil to linoleum manu-facture.
