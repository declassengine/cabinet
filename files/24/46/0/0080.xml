[This Document is the Property of His Britannic ltiajesty&apos;s5 Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.  March 1918.SiSECRET.NAVAL  WEEKLY  APPRECIATION-No. 44.Week ended 23rd March, 1918.NAVAL  OPERATIONS.    On 18th March, one of our Large America seaplanes, whilst on patrol 10 miles north North Ses.of Terschelling, chased two enemy seaplanes and continued a running fight for half anhour.   One enemy machine was damaged but was able to continue on its course, and ourseaplane also sustained some damage,  necessitating the breaking off of the action.   Onthe return journey,  when  off the  S.W. end of Terschelling three enemy seaplanes wereencountered, which pursued the Large America as far as Texel.    On 19th March, three of our  Large America seaplanes,  while carrying out a longdistance reconnaissance, engaged two enemy seaplanes between 5 and 10 miles E.N.E. ofBorkum, and one of the latter was driven down in flames.    On 21st March our seaplanes, while carrying out a reconnaissance in Heligoland Bight,attacked enemy minesweepers with machine-gun fire.    Minelaying operations  in the North Sea and the Heligoland Bight have been continued.    On 17th March, during an afternoon patrol, R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk attacked Flandersthree enemy destroyers three miles N.E. of Zeebrugge and bombs were  observed to  fall area&quot;near the enemy vessels.    On 21st March Dunkirk machines dropped four 230 lb. bombs amongst nine enemydestroyers off Ostend, and  a destroyer was also bombed six miles north of Zeebrugge.  butthe results could not be observed, owing to  poor visibility.    R.N.A.S.  machines from Dunkirk have also  carried out several other patrols andreconnaissances,  during which many combats took place, resulting in six enemy machinesbeing destroyed and seven  driven down out of control.  Two of our machines have failedto return.    On 21st March, at 3.55 a.m.,  a force of  German destroyers bombarded Dunkirk forten minutes and retired.   H.M. Ships &quot; Botha &quot; (Flotilla Leader) and &quot; Morris &quot; (T.B.D.),together with the French destroyers &quot; Boucher,&quot; &quot; Capitaine Mehl &quot; and &quot; Magon,&quot; gavechase  and  fell in with another  division  of enemy  destroyers,  which the)&apos;&apos; engaged.&quot; Botha &quot; fired two torpedoes, one of which hit a large German destroyer,  and she thenrammed and cut in two a torpedo boat, but shortly  afterwards  &quot; Botha  &quot; was herselftorpedoed  in  her fore boiler room.  &quot; Morris,&quot; next  astern, claims to  have  torpedoeda large destroyer and to  have seen her sink by the  stern,  and the French destroyer &quot; Capitaine Mehl &quot;  also claims to have torpedoed a large destroyer and to have seen hersink. Another torpedo boat was also sunk by gunfire,  and survivors from the two enemytorpedo boats &quot; A.7 &quot; and &quot; A.19  &quot; were picked up.     In the meantime, Coastal Motor Boat 20 chased the destroyers which had bombarded Dunkirk, and torpedoed one large destroyer and  then  escaped with the aid of a smoke screen, under very heavy  fire from the enemy.    (C 1047) Wt.   55  3/18 H &amp; S
              &quot; Botha &quot; safely readied Dunkirk, where  she was docked.   The British casualties          were : &quot; Botha,&quot; 13 killed and 7 wounded ;  &quot; Morris,&quot; 2 wounded.              The French destroyers were undamaged and suffered no casualties.              On 21st March the monitor &quot; Terror &quot; bombarded Ostend with satisfactory results,          39 rounds being fired, about ten of which exploded  not more than 300 yards from the          Atelier de Marine ; a smoke screen was  used after the first round.  Enemy batteries          returned the  fire but scored no hits, and enemy aircraft attacked our machines while          spotting, with the result that an enemy machine was destroyed.              On 23rd  and 24th March,  the  enemy again bombarded Dunkirk but there was  no          damage of importance, and only one casualty.Casualties.      On 19th  March the armed Merchant Cruiser &quot; Motagua &quot;  and the United States          Destroyer &quot; Manley &quot; collided 145 miles S.W. of,the Scillies.  Depth charges exploded on          both ships, damaging them aft, but they were able to make their way to port.              On 22nd  March the Sloop &quot; Gaillardia &quot; was sunk by a mine about 20 miles  to the          eastward of the Orkney Islands, 2 Officers and 64 men being lost.              On 23rd  March the Destroyers &quot; Hope &quot; and &quot; Arno &quot; collided while on Dardanelles          patrol.  &quot; Arno &quot; was sunk and &quot; Hope  damaged,  one officer and one man being lost.              On 23rd  March the Drifter &quot; New  Dawn &quot; was  sunk by mine whilst sweeping the          entrance to the Needles Channel.                              ATTACK  UPON ENEMY SUBMAEINES.Submarines     The number of large enemy submarines which have been located this week is onlyoperating.   X3, but in spite of the comparatively small number operating, they appear to have been          more active and-successful than usual.   Five were vessels of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot;          type, one of which was homeward bound, working between the African Coast and Madeira,          while the  other four  were operating to the west and north-west of that Island.  The          remaining large submarines have been  operating chiefly  off the coasts  of Ireland and at          the western entrance  to the English Channel;  the  Irish Sea and the English  Channel,          especially the latter, having been the scene of great enemy activity.  Towards the end of          the week at least three submarines appear to have been concentrated on the Southampton -          Havre route, possibly in connection with the enemy offensive in France.Actions        The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, andsubmarines. aiso the number of  submarines destroyed : Nature of Craft.

There is also probability that, as a result  of  offensive action of the Dover Trawlerand Drifter Patrol, a submarine was destroyed in the minefield on the 19th instant, butthis has not yet been verified.    On March 23rd the TIC. 48 put into Ferrol with engine defects and has been interned.MERCANTILE  LOSSES BY ENEMY  ACTION.

The figures for the previousweek  as given in last week&apos;s Appreciation are now increased  by over 22,000  tons, ofwhich more than 17,000 are of foreign shipping.    The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage  of sailings and Losses ofof losses by enemy action, and the percentage  of losses to sailings of  British merchant qfrit*s\-steamships of over 500 tons gross register ;  and the table in Appendix II shows by trades, -m tra(jesas regards such ships, the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to  tomiage sailingto and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.    The British tonnage engaged in Overseas trades this week  was  considerably largerthan usual, but the losses also were heavy and the percentage of losses to sailings worksout at 1-51 as against 1-06 in the previous week.  In coasting  and cross-Channel trafficthe percentage  is -80 as against -40 last week, while as regards all  traffic to and fromthe United Kingdom, the percentage is 1-09 as against -62 last week.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign Areas inas well as British,  sunk, damaged, and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by      jQgtenemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.    The number of attacks recorded this week indicate considerably increased activity onthe part  of the  enemy, particularly in the Channel and the Irish Sea and to a less degreein the Mediterranean.  There were,  however,  fewer attacks in the North Sea and on theOcean routes.   The percentage of successful attacks is also  higher  than  usual thisweek, particularly in the Mediterranean where 15 attacks resulted in the sinking  of 11ships (of which  10 were sailing in convoy), and in 3 others being damaged.?(C 1047)A 2
ENEMY MINES.Minelaying.     Enemy minelaying has this week been experienced in the Lowestoft, Nore, Dover          and Portsmouth areas.   Special arrangements and precautions are now in force in regard          to  traffic using the War Channel between the Thames and Lowestoft, so as to obviate          the holding up of shipping in this vital area longer than is absolutely necessary.Casualties.

                       MOVEMENTS OF  ENEMY SHIPS.    The increase in the number of enemy merchant ships trading between Germany and Merchant-Norwegian ports outside the Oattegat is maintained, 17 having arrived at, and 15 having mm&apos;sailed from,  such ports during the week under review.   No  enemy ships have enteredor left Rotterdam.                      FOREIGN NAVAL  INTELLIGENCE.                                     FRANCE.    The French S./M. &quot; Diane &quot; was lost on patrol about the 12th  March, in similarcircumstances to the &quot; Bernouilli,&quot; which disappeared a few weeks earlier.  The &quot; Diane &quot;was completed in 1914 and had a complement of 30.                                     ITALY.    Changes have recently taken place in nearly all the Flag Appointments in the ItalianNavy.  It is  reported that the late Commander-in-Chief  and the Commander-in-Chief,Battle Squadron, were superseded owing to their having been indirectly responsible forthe loss of the battleship &quot; Leonardo da Vinci,&quot; in Taranto harbour in August, 1916.    The  new  Commander-in-Chief,  Vice - Admiral  Cusani, K.C.M.G., C.B.  (who waspreviously Assistant to the Chief of the Naval Staff)  will remain ashore with his liead-quarters at Brindisi.    The new Commander-in-Chief of the Battle Squadron, Vice-Admiral Solari, previouslycommanded the 1st and 2nd Divisions, and is said to be a clever and able man.                                     RUSSIA.    The authorities at Archangel have been instructed to adopt a friendly attitude towardsthe British and French, but in view  of continual changes in the general situation it isimpossible to conjecture what the local conditions may be on the arrival of the supply ships.    Duibenko, the head of the Naval  College, has been arrested for having declared thatin the event of peace being ratified he  would urge the sailors of the Baltic Fleet to opposethe Bolsheviks.                                     SPAIN.    The new Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Navy is Admiral D. Jose Pidal y Rebollo,who was Chief of the Naval Staff.  Vice-Admiral D. Augusto Miranda y Godoy has beenappointed to the command of  the Instruction  Squadron,  and Vice-Admiral D.  GabrielAnton y Iboleon, formerly Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, has succeeded him as Com-niander-in-Chief at Cadiz.    Three more Spanish ships have been sunk by German submarines during the last week.                                   GERMANY.    The crew of &quot;U.  110,&quot; which was destroyed after sinking the s.s.  &quot;Amazon&quot; onMarch 15th, numbered 43, including 7 supernumerary ratings on board for training.   Tenof these were saved, and their interrogation has elicited some interesting facts.    The most striking feature  immediately apparent was the youth and  inexperience ofthe men.  The Engineer-Lieutenant had only served in training boats; one Engine-RoomP.O. had been in &quot; U. 66 &quot; for 4 weeks, but had not been to sea in her,  and one of thewireless operators had been on board  &quot; U. 30 &quot; for about a year.  None of the other  sur-vivors had had any practical experience other than that gained in &quot; IT. 110.&quot;  Four PettyOfficers, who were lost with the boat,  are stated to have seen from two to four years&apos; sub-toarine service, but the other members of the crew who were lost appear to have been   (C1047)           .                                                     A3  j
as inexperienced as the survivors.  The loss of the submarine is probably in a great measureattributable to the want of experience of her crew.    It was  stated  that there is a  lack of  qualified petty officers  for the submarineservice, and that, although there are  reserve crews for submarines, the men are  nothingmore than untrained recruits.  The recent heavy losses  in submarines are said  to havemade, the crews extremely nervous, and the majority of the survivors of &quot;U. 110&quot; wereglad to have been made prisoners.    Informants stated that since the mutiny in the High Sea Fleet, conditions with regardto food have been considerably improved, and that there is little discontent at present.They no longer believe  in the likelihood of a naval battle  on a large  scale.    The Engineer-Lieutenant stated that he had had access to the operation orders issuedto his Commanding Officer,  which,  contained  very strict injunctions against  sinkinghospital  ships.                                     AUSTRIA.    In order to promote the more direct control by the Emperor of all  the fighting forcesof the Monarchy, a new  appointment has been created in the Austrian Navy with the titleof Inspector-General of the Navy.  He will be a Flag Officer and in personal contact withthe Emperor, and will be responsible for seeing that all orders issued by the Emperor arecarried out.   The Flag  Officer appointed is Vice-Admiral Franz Eitter von Keil.    The  Chief  of the Naval Section of the Ministry of War (as regards administrativequestions) and  the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet (as regards  operations of the Fleet)will,  however, still remain directly responsible to the Emperor.    Rear-Admiral Holub is appointed Head of the Naval Section, Ministry of War, andRear-Admiral Horthy is appointed Commander-in-Chief of  the Fleet.   The latter officerwas in command of the Light Forces in the &quot; Novara &quot; during the engagement in theStraits of Otranto in the summer of 1917,  and he  is said to be strong,  energetic andventuresome.NAVAL STAFF,    28ft March, 1918.[APPENDICES.
