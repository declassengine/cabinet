        PROPOSED MILITARY SERVjOLSSiliA              16?       i^rn^andum oy G^        Stanley.I need hardly say that any well considered measure    K&amp;t will  effectively increase the armed forces of the country%W ^at the  present  junoture will receive my cordial support.             The draft Bill suggested by the Birector-Gener&amp;l of   National Service  proposes        (1)   to get  more men by widening the field for recruiting;        (2)   to get  more men by altering the machinery for                  determining exemptions.             As regards (l)  I do not  desire to make any observations   on the  proposal to  apply conscription to Ireland,  as I have no   means of forming  a  first-hand judgment  as to the degree of   resistance likely to-be encountered in  putting that proposal   into  effect.             I am  in favour cf widening the age limits of com-   pulsion.   &apos;l am disposed&apos; to think  that  no useful military   purpose will be served oy raising  the upper limit to 55,  as the   number  of  men fit for general service between the ages of 50   and 55  who could  be mads available for  general service abroad   is I  beliete very small.    I therefore  think that the upper   limit should not  be higher than 50;  and if it be decided to   lower the  age of  compulsion to 17  I would strongly urge that no   person  should actually be sent abroad for military service   before  the age  of 18-1-.             As regards (2),  I feel much greater doubt about   the very drastic  proposal to cancel ail existing exemptions   and to  abolish  tribunals.    I fear that such a proposal   will give  rise  to serious unrest in labour circles,  and may   not improbably  lead to stoppages of work which will affect the   essential  production of food and munitions.     Moreover,   the uncertainty arising out of the wholesale withdrawal of(This OocumentjBj^e^^per^^cu^His Britannic Jv1afesty?s Gov-ftrnrr                 -1-certificates
certificates is likely cf itself to impair productionat a critical time.   I find it difficult tc understandwhat gain is expected from so drastic a change, and Iwould suggest that before the War Cabinet seriously con-sider a proposal which will be so distasteful to labour,and which will be. criticised as involving the cancellationof a large number of Government pledges, the Director-General of National Service should be asked to supply arough estimate cf the number of men fit for general servicewho he thinks can be obtained through the alteration ofprocedure alone, together with particulars as to the sourcesfrom which these men will be drawn.  Unless the gain isvery much greater than I believe, I see great objectionto the scrapping of all the existing machinery and thewiping out of all the laborious work of adjudication accorn-plished through such machinery during the last two years.     Whatever the defects of some tribunals may have been,the bulk of this work has been well and carefully done,amd it will have to be- re-done by the new Advisory Commit-tees under conditions of pressure of time which make itvery unlikely that it will be done better.  The existingmachinery has corns to be accepted as adequately democratic,while that which is to be substituted will inevitably becriticised as unduly bureaucratic.     Moreover the wholesale cancellation of exemptions willlead to unnecessary and embarrassing complications in thecase of conscientious objectors, men wounded and invalidedout of the Army, &amp;c., to say nothing of those employed insuch vitally essential wo rk as shipbuilding, munition workand food production.
       If the ease for a change is the variation of thestandard adopted by tribunals in different districts,and it is desired that there should be some general powerof revision apart from the revision of particular cases ofappeal, this could surely be secured without the upheavaland disturbance that will result from the present proposals.       Por example:  the Central Appeal Tribunal, or ifpreferred, th? Director-General of National Service inconsultation with that body, might b? armed with the powerof revision apart from any specific appeals.       In considering this matter I naturally begin byexamining the case of the industries controlled by theBoard  of Trade.   To take first the case of coal mines,the T/ar Cabinet are well aware that the difficulty recentlyexperienced of securing adequate recruits from the coalmines has not in any way arisen from defects in themachinery of tribunals, but from the attitude of the iiinero&apos;federation which, to say the least, is unlikely to beimproved by the controversies which would arise out of theproposed Bill.       As regards Railway labour, it is difficult tosee how any gain can result to recruiting from the change,as the recruitinv of railway labour cannot possibly be amatter for local Advisory Committees, so that the Director-General of national Service will be practically compelled toaot  in consultation with the Railway Executive and to accepttheir  advice, which is exactly the situation to-day.       As regards Port labour, I dcubt the possibility,without making the shipping problem mere acute,  of with-drawing a substantially greater number of men than are already                                                     &quot;o e &apos;i n a1
      &quot;being decertif icated-. through the Port Labour Committees.      In any case, the wholesale cancelling cf examptions would      in no way help in this matter, and might easily result      in a transport labour strike.            In the case of Timber, it is no doubt possible      to get a certain number for the Army by depleting the      labour force now employed in the production of home-grown      timber;  but this would be a moot serious blunder, as any      small gain would be m^de at an wholly disproportionate      cost when, it is remembered that the \rery obj3ct of home      timber production is to save tonnag2 and thus incidentally      to set free ships to bring over American troops.            I therefore hope that any Bill will be directed      tc the widening of the age limits of compulsion, tho      extension (if considered politic) of compulsion to Ireland,      and to taking power  of revising in case of necessity      the exemptions granted by tribunals so as to secure uniforn&quot;.ty      of standard.    This will I think give the Director General      of National Service  all the real powers he needs.            In conclusion  I am particularly anxious that      nothinj should be hastily dene, th? offeet of which whether      be reducing home production or impeding the movement of      shipping in our ports, will make -it more difficult to      spare ships to bring from America (the last remaining great      reservoir of man-power) the army now in. training in that      country.                                         (Signed) A.  H.  STANLEY.Board of Trade,       28th March,  1313.
