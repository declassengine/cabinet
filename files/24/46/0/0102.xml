 M PORT OP     W THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received a tele-fpBWB?^ Spaw  from A^10^ in whioh President Wilson stated that           he  would despatch American Infantry to Prance at the rate           of  120,000 per month for the next four months, and if ship-           pin.?  were available this monthly number would be increased.           Mr  LLOYD GEORGE said that, in this connection, co-ordination          &quot; of  control was, in his opinion, essential, and that he had           already experienced the necessity for this in regard to the           despatch of reinforcements to Prance during the recent fight-           ing.                 Mr GRAEME THOMSON agreed with the Prime Minister           that  this was very necessary, and pointed out that, even if           arrangements were made for the necessary shipping, the trans-           port  of troops could not proceed satisfactorily unless the           troops were immediately available for embarkation.  He sug-           gested that he should himself proceed to America as soon-ae           possible.                 LORD DERBY expressed the opinion that a representative           of  the War Office should accompany Mr Graeme Thomson, in           order to assist in ensuring that the American troops were           ready for embarkation,                 GENERAL MCRi&quot;;ADY agreed with Lord Derby, and put for-           ward  the name of General Kutchinson as. a suitable officer.           He  also stated, with regard to equipment, that stores were           available in this country to provide rifles and equipment           for 500,000 American troops, but that, if any of these troops           were  to be used with the French Army, it would be necessary           that  they should be equipped with rifles of the French pat-           tern.  He stated that he was fully of opinion that General           Poch  would naturally expect a number of the American reinforce-           ments to be incorporated into the French Army.                 The Conference agreed that:-                (a) Mr Graeme Thomson and General Hutchinson                   should proceed to America at the  earliest                   opportunity, in order to co-ordinate  the                   work of transporting American troops  across                   the Atlantic:
               (b) The Prime Minister should send a telegram                   to President Wilson,  informing him of this                  -arrangement, and that rifles and equipment                   were available in this oountry for 500,000                   men, but that any of the American troops                   which were to be incorporated into the                   French Army would be equipped, if neces-                   sary, by the French authorities.*L0YMENT OF    (2? THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was very desirable[RICAN TROOPSPRANCE.    that a definite plan should be prepared for the employment          of American reinforcements in France, and that a complete          understanding should be come to with General Perahing on          this subject.  Ke suggested that it might be possible to          increase the strength of the present 3ritish Divisions from          9 Battalions to 10 or 11, in which case the American rein-          forcements would be incorporated into our Divisions by Bat-          talions;  that, where losses in British Divisions had been          very heavy, it would be advisable to reduce the number of          the British Battalions; and that, should there be a surplus          of British officers, these officers should be lent to the          American Battalions for instructional and other purposes.  .                 GENERAL WILSON expressed the view that Mr Baker&apos;s          opinion should be obtained on this question.                 THE PRIME MINISTER deprecated the idea of travelling          to France in order to discuss this question, and suggested          that it vould be advisable if General Pershing, General          Bliss and Mr Baker could come to London.                 The Conference agreed that:-               (a) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff                   should ascertain if General Pershing,                   General Bliss and Mr Baker could come to                   London, and should report to the Prime                   Minister:               (b) The Adjutant-General should immediately                   prepare a scheme for the utilisation of                   American reinforcements arrivirg in France.r^lSf?2L     ^ GENERAL WILSON informed the Conference that  the total^AoUALTIES,          casualties among the British Infantry during the  recent          heavy fighting in France numbered 120,000,  and expressed the          opinion that the Army must be  prepared for further  heavy          casualties.  Without taking into consideration any  American
reinforcements, 100,000 men were being sent immediately toreplace casualties from this oountry;  in addition to thatnumber, the normal replacement of 20,000 men per month wouldcontinue.  He. stated that Oenaany had  00,000 men availablefor reinforcements in field depots, and a further 200,000men in home depots, while the Director of Military Intelli-genoe had reckoned that 100,000 men were still available tobe moved from the Russian Front to the Western Front.  TheDirector of Military Intelligence thought it probable thatthe 100,000 men would oome as drafts and not as reinforcingDivisions.  This.gave a total of possible German reinforee-inents of 500,000.  There were also some 8 or 10 Divisionsof German troops about whose movementa no information hadbeen ascertained.    Questioned as to French reinforcements,GENERAL VflLSOK said that he waa informed that the French Armycwould rely on reinforcements to the extent of 200,000 of allarms, which number, together with reinforcements from Englandand a probable 30,000 men from Dominion troops, would givethe Allied Armies a total reinforcement of 350,000.       TKB PRIMB MINISTER said that by the end of May nextthere should be 200,000 American troops ready to reinforcethe Allied Armies.       GENERAL WILSON agreed,  but pointed out,  however,  thatit was essential that these troops should have gome weeks&apos;training,  especially as Battalions, before it could be con-sidered that they would be fit to take the field.       THES PRIMS MINISTER agreed, but said that,  taking intoconsideration all possible reinforcements, there  should be,on the whole,  an equality of numbers  in May between theAllied troops  and those that could be opposed to  them.       GENERAL WILSON said that  this  would certainly be  ao,but the whole  question really  turned  on the  number  of casual-ties which would occur in the  near future,  as it  waa possiblefor the Germans to put  their immediate reinforcements in thefield more quickly  than the  British could  do  ao.
       WW PMCH feferred to the question of Home Defence,and stated that, if it was decided to aend to Prance the$0,000 B.l. men previously agreed upon, he thought  that itwaB only right that he should point out that, in the eventof &amp; hostile landing, there were not sufficient troops avail-able.  Of the seven mixed Brigades there would be left only.4,000 B,fi. men vho wera trained;  of the three Divisionscomposing the 23rd Army Corps there would be 5,000  trainedInfantry,  all of them A.4, men;  of the Cyclist Brigadesthere would be only 1,000 trained men,   and of the  23 CyclistBattalions there would be 400 trained men.  He did  not putthis forward to the Conference with any idea of not consider-ing  it deairable to send the 3,1. men,  but thought  that theposition as regards -Hoac Defence should be made quite clear.       The Conference agreed that:-         The SO,000 8.1. men should be  sent         as reinforcements to France.hltehall Gardens, S.W.,April 1, 1918.
