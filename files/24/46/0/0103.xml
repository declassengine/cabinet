                     WAR  CABI&amp;ET.               TEE MILITARY SITUATION.(Copy of  telegram from Prime Minister to toe Dominions, 30 March 1918)    Following  from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister.  Thesituation caused by enemy attack has now begun to clear.   We havepassed through  a most  critical time while the enemy was. trying dee-perately to break up our Army.   Thanks to the wonderful tenacity andfighting Power  of our  Army  in tfhieh troops from all the Dominions haveplayed a conspicuous and invaluable part this primary intention of theenemy was frustrated.   We  have nov good hope of being able graduallyto bring his present effort to a standstill, but we may possibly loseA  lens.   The near future will show whether or not he will be able toreach that place.   If he succeeds in doing this the military situa-tion ?/Ill be very grave.    In any ease having undoubtedly proved hiscapacity to break through the Western front on a wide front it is eertairthat his military command,  if it is unable to obtain all that it aimedat in this battle, will immediately begia to refit its army foranother blow at the earliest possible moment.   The whole militaryfuture will depend upon our being able to refit and maintain our armiesin time.   If we do not succeed in doing this it will give him theohanoe of delivering that knock-out blow with which the German leadershope to win the war.    Looking past the immediate battle, therefore,the fundamental problem before us is man-power.     Our losses up to the  present in only a weekl&amp; fighting are about120?000 men and all trained and partially trained reserves in thiscountry will be used up in  making this good.   We are, therefore,taking immediate action to  raise fresh troops by raising the military   to 50, and  taking  boys  of 18,  and by making another large comb-outof industry, which will cause the greatest dislocation and.hardship toour industries,   w$ are qXb0 prepared t&apos;o face trouble in Irelandbecause we feel that it is  vital that we should be able to prove our-selvee stronger than the Germane this&apos;summer.   By this means we hopeto obtain a reinforcement of between 400,000 and 500,000 men for ourway.   Finally, we are asking the American Government to send overimmediately as much of their army as can be transported across theAtlantio in order to keep the Allied armies up to strength during theoritioal mouths of May, June and Vuly before our new forces are suffic-iently trained for use in France,  and when we may oxpeot the e&amp;emy toattempt his second blow,     Wa trust that your Government will do its very utmost to get asjwiy aen to Europe as  they  possibly can in the shortest possible time*o make good the heavy casualties  which the forces of your Dominionm% undoubtedly have  suffered,  and if possible to increase theseinr*i?8*         e Dominions and youro among them have done splendidlyAA this battle, but assuming that  we can stay the enemy1 a present nort the issue of the war will depend on whether the Germans or the ,Jfti* 8 are ths *i*Bt in making good their losses,  The Germans will srtairly not delay an Instant.    They have the man-power with which to2 ^   arid they have the Austriass in reserve.    If we all do our utmost  ^ave no doubt we can make  it impossible for them to succeed.   But weUavd no time to lose.&amp;Pn*?y separate cable  I am  sending a message for publication supple- *^ing the official communique  issued to-night.
