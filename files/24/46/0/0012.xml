SECRET.                   MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.    Report  for  Week  ending  Wednesday,  March  20,  1918.                        PART  I. ACTION  TAKEN.                         Orders and Announcements.    (1) The Flour Mills (Prohibition of Smoking) Order, 1918, dated the 13th March,1918,  forbids smoking in any flour mill or warehouse connected therewith.    (2) The Freshwater Fish (England and Wales) Order, 1918, dated the 14th March,1918,  permits the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to authorise  the use of anymethods or appliances for the puipose of taking freshwater fish at times or in placesor circumstances which would otherwise be unlawful.  Provision is also made for thepossession, sale, or purchase of such fish at times otherwise unlawful.    (3) The Fish (Registration of Dealers) Order, 1918, dated the 14-th March,  1918,provides for the licensing of all wholesale dealers  in  fish, and for the registration  ofretail  dealers and hawkers.    (4) The Prevention of  Corruption Order,  1918, dated  the 15th March,  1918,prohibits persons engaged in the sale, delivery, or distribution of food or drink fromaccepting any gift or consideration as an inducement for giving priority or preferenceto one purchaser over another.   The prohibition does not apply when the sale  is forconsumption on the seller&apos;s premises.    (5) The Live Stock (Restriction of Slaughter) Order, 1918, dated  the 16th March,1918,  prohibits the slaughter of  any beast unless bought or  sold in  a market within14 days previously.  It revokes  the Order made on 9th December, 1917,  and removesthe prohibition against the sale  of  lamb before  the  15th June, 1918.  The object  ofthe prohibition was originally to prevent the use of concentrated feeding stuffs for thefattening of lambs, and there is  reason to believe that on the whole the Order achievedthis aim.  Since, however, feeding stuffs are now to be rationed to farmers under theCattle Feeding Stuffs Rationing  Order the amount of feeding  stuffs available for ewesand lambs will be strictly limited, and it is felt that there  is no  further  necessity forthe prohibition against the sale of fat lamb.    (6) The Fish (Prices) Order, 1918, dated the 14th March, 1918, fixes the maximumprices chargeable by the producer, and the wholesale and retail  dealer.  Provision isalso made to meet the case of  inland wholesale dealers in fish who purchase from thecoast  Avholesale  dealers and  sell to the retailer.  The retail  prices  are for the mostpart identical with those laid down in the original Order and producers&apos; and wholesaleprices have been settled by agreement with a Committee consisting of representativesof the producers as well as  of each section of the trade engaged in distribution.Power is given to local Food Control  Committees to vary retail prices.  The  Orderpermits the sale  of fish otherwise than by weight, although  the seller must weigh thefish when so required by the purchaser, and is held responsible for seeing  that themaximum price  is not exceeded.    (7) The Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order,  1918, dated 19th March,1918,  comes into  operation  on 1st April, 1918.  It allows the  maximum standardbarrelage which a brewer for sale may brew in any quarter to be  the same amount ashe was permitted  to brew in  the quarter  commencing 1st April 1917, namely, hisshare of 10,720,442 standard barrels per annum for the whole of the United Kingdom.The  average  gravity at which  a brewer for sale may in any quarter brew suchstandard  barrelage must not exceed l,045o in Ireland and l,030o in other parts ofthe United Kingdom.  Certificates may not be transferred from Great  Britain toIreland or vice versa.     (8) The Beer (Prices and Description) Order, 1918,  dated the 19th  March, 1918, regulates  the sale of  certain   draught  beer in  a  public bar and provides for themaximum prices which may be  charged.

    Agricultural Advisory Committee. In  pursuance of his intention stated in lastweek&apos;s Report to set up a Committee for the purpose &quot;of giving advice  on agriculturalmatters,  Lord Rhondda  has invited the&quot; following Agricultural Bodies  to nominaterepresentatives as follows : : ,  ..       .  ......-......                                                                     No.      &amp;, The National Farmers&apos; Union   .-   .  .  -      -    - -   yt  -  .4.      &apos;&quot;&apos;  &quot;The Scottish Farmers&apos; Union&apos;   -     &apos;-:&quot;-&quot;*&quot;&apos;&quot; &quot;&apos;&quot; -&quot;&apos;    &quot;&apos;-  &quot;&quot;  &apos;  -  1         The Central Chamber of Agriculture         .......   -       -  3       -  The Scottish Chamber of Agriculture   -      -      -       -  I         The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries -      -      -       -  1         The Scottish Board of Agriculture &apos;    -;  -          -       -  1         The Irish Board of Agriculture -       -      -      -       -  1         The Royal Agricultural  Society&apos;-&apos;&apos;    - &apos;            -       -  3         The Royal Dublin  Society      -     .-      -      -   ,      1with  the addition of three nominated members by  the Food Controller.   LordRhondda will act as Chairman and Mr. Anker Simmons, C.B.E., as Deputy-Chairman.     Consumers  Council. On Wednesday, 21st.  March, after hearing  Col. Weigall,the Council expressed the opinion that an immediate and substantial reduction shouldbe made in the meat ration issued to the 600,000 men in  the Home Army engaged inwork involving no undue  physical strain, and that enquiry should be made into thequestion of a more general reduction affecting all men not actually in or close behind thefrontline, or about to  go into the line.  A  resolution, was /passed in favour of fixingmaximum retail prices for carrots and other roots, Mr.  Carr stating that the decreasein the consumption of vegetables was  mainly due to the decreased consumption ofmeat without  which potatoes or  other  vegetables were not eaten.   A memorandumwas read on the position as regards poultry, and the Council  approved the issue.of abrief statement to Counteract the  impression  that an  immediate  and  extensivereduction of stocks &quot;was desirable.    Rationing of Live Stock. Lord Rhondda is extending to certain other classes oflive stock the existing system&apos; of priority certificates under the Cattle Feeding Stuffs(Priority Supply) Order,  1918,  which are  now granted only to dairy cattle in milk.These additional classes, and  the maximum quantities  of feeding stuffs imder thecertificates, are :--     Calves under six months old, \ lb. per day.     Horses maintained and  used  for agricultural purposes, 10 lbs. per day.   - Breeding sows, 4  lbs. per day.    Store pigs, 1% lbs. per day.    In granting certificates the  amount of feeding stuffs in the possession of theapplicant will be considered, and  in the case of  sows and pigs no guarantee  can  begiven that certificates can be granted for a  supply during  the summer months.     Seamen&apos;s Voluntary Rations. On March 20 a representative delegation of officers,engineers, seamen,  and firemen had a Conference with Lord Rhondda, the  ShippingController, and officials of the Board of Trade/ The representatives of the mercantilemarine unanimously resolved to  accept voluntarily a reduction of their  meat  rationsfor the  &quot;period  of  the war.   A committee,; representing the Board of Trade, theshipowners, and the men, was appointed to draw up a detailed scheme.    Self Suppliers.-Lord Somerleyton&apos;s Committee. has recommended that personsbona fide co-operating to keep animals, whether  as individuals or as members of agroup or club or association, should be treated as actual producers under the rationingscheme for meat and fats.  It is proposed  that the self-supplier should be entitled inso far as he consumes  his own produce to count it towards his ration at the followingrates.;-   &apos;       ^       .  .J:.  ^    t   .          -h   &apos;           Cattle and Sheep.

One-half more than the normal weekly ration.                              SUPPLIES AND PRICES.    Allied Requirements.--&quot;-The Wheat Executive have replied by cable in detail tothe important  cablegram received from Mr. Hoover through Mr. Sheldon, which wasprinted in last week&apos;s Report., While agreeing that the monthly outgo of wheat anddilutants is 750,000 tons, or, more accurately, 750,000 quarters a week in the UnitedKingdom, the  Wheat Executive  point out that this includes damage and  wastage aswell as human, consumption, and  that during the last two months  the outgo has beensubject to exceptional causes.  They urge  that it is extremely  difficult to make areliable estimate of the actual  consumption of breadstuffs in the United Kingdomover*&quot;&apos;any  short period, and  they  express  themselves  unable  to follow  Mr. Hoover&apos;scomparative statement as to: the consumption in this country being 30 percent, higherthan that  of the United States without knowledge of the  basis on which his estimateis framed. While realising that the  United States must retain sufficient  breadstuffsfor their own population^ the Wheat  Executive hope Mr. Hoover will accept the viewthat stock in importing countries cannot be left at the  end of the cereal year at a levelthat would be safe for an exporting country.   They express the strong  hope that theUnited States  will not  be compelled to draw  supplies.from  the  Argentine, and thatany&apos;-impqrtatipn.^hicli,;may..^e needed from America will be drawn so far as possiblefrom  Australia.  They reiterate the hope that all breadstuff cereals which can bespared in the United.States shall be reserved for the Allies.    Lord Rhondda has cabled to Lord Reading, setting forth very  fully the conditionsin the United  Kingdom, which so far have deterred him from  putting into force thecompulsory rationing of bread/and asking Lord Reading and Mr. Hoover to give himthe benefit of their views  as to  the effect on the international situation of a post-ponement of more drastic measures with regard to bread.    . With reference to Mr.  Hoover&apos;s  offer of 450,000 tons,  of  pork  products, theChancellor of  the Exchequer and Mr. Austen Chamberlain, on behalf of  the AmericanBoard, have cabled to Lord Reading, expressing gratitude  for the offer, and statingthat the Ministry of Food would be glad to accept it without reservation, but that theMinistry of Shipping could not lift the whole quantity between the beginning of Marchand end of May, although there is reasonable expectation of  arranging the necessaryshipping  by the end-of June.   They point out that -. while  the  supplies  offered areurgently needed, many difficulties have to be overcome in the way of rapidly adaptingthe transportation and  docking machinery on both sides of the Atlantic to deal withsuch  very large quantities.   With regard to the financial facilities for these purchases,Lord Reading has been asked to arrange the matter in Washington, in conjunctionwith  Mr.  McAdoo and Mr. Hoover.     Bacon, Rams, and Lard. Large supplies are arriving from America  and willcontinue  to arrive,  since Mr. HooverV offer  has been substantially accepted.  -Anincreased distribution  is contemplated  and the  necessary preparations are  beingmade... A Section&apos;has  been  set up  to  arrange the storing of such bacon as. is notimmediately distributed.    &quot; A meeting of the Bacon Advisory Committee was held on the 20th March, 1918,to consider the revised Distribution   Scheme necessitated by  the  adoption of the tieto the retailer for bacon mentioned  in  the previous Report.   The main priniples ofthe Scheme were approved.    -       &apos;     As it has been decided to increase the price of pigs, it will be necessary to revisethe prices&apos;-fixed for home-produced bacon;                                      v   &quot; Butter.- 088 tons of butter have been purchased in the United States of Americaat 4-2 to 47 cents per lb., and 25 tons  have been purchased;in Canada  at 38 to  29^-cents per lb. ;  7,464 tons of butter have arrived in this country, of which 6,566 tonscame from Australia, 247  tons  from New Zealand, 624 tons from the  Argentine, 17tons from Canada,  and 10 tons from the United States of America;  21,171 tons ofbutter are now on the water.     A distribution of butter is being made this  week amounting to one quarter of the amount asked for by each applicant for the month of March,
     Cheese. The quantity of new season New Zealand cheese which  is now arrivingin this country is 1,991 tons,  6,726 tons are on the way, and 25,019 tons are  awaitingshipment.  A further 18 tons of Canadian cheese have been shipped, and If tons  ofDutch cheese has arrived, but no further information has been received from Hollandas to quantities available in the future.     Cocoa. Mr. Owen Smith has reported the purchase of a further 358 tons of cocoapowder lying in New York.     Dried Fruits-The S.S. &quot; Cadagua,&quot; with some 1,400 tons  of Malaga raisins hasleft Spain for a Bristol Channel port.     Plans are being completed to bring into operation as soon as possible the new schemefor the control  of dried  fruits, which has been necessitated by the decision  to repealthe Dried Fruits (Restriction) Order.     Meat.--The supplies of home-killed meat in the large distributing markets  haveproved disappointing, but in spite of this no complaints were  received last week ofshort supplies from London and the Home Counties, since good  supplies of importedmeat have been coming forward and in fact a surplus of  meat remained on SmithfieldMarket at the close of the week.  Considerable progress  is being made in the estab-lishments of  reserve stocks of imported meat in all  parts of the country and it ishoped to accumulate an adequate supply in  all  the  principal centres before thenational rationing scheme  comes into  operation.   In  this  connection DistributionCommittees are being established in each of the live stock areas, and it  is hoped thatby decentralising  in this  way  all  defects  in  supply may be speedily remedied.Extremely heavy supplies of canned meat are expected within the next six weeks, andthese will prove  a valuable  adjunct  at  a time when  the production of home-grownstock is likely to be at its lowest figure.   .  There are good grounds for thinking  that strict supervision will have to  beexercised to  prevent the sale of  meat without coupons and in excess  of prescribedquantities, but not the least  satisfactory feature  of the scheme  is the readiness withwhich it has met with public acquiescence ; in  fact,  the public has given it a morefriendly welcome than the trade-     It is proposed to issue a Pigs (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918,  which will  havethe  effect of raising the prices  of pigs sold for slaughter by live and dead weight,and  it is hoped that this  will  furuish a  valuable stimulus to the production of pigs,and  thus provide an additional reserve for the future.     Milk. At Lord Rhondda&apos;s request, the Joint Committee of  the Ministry of Foodand  the Board of Agriculture on the Production and Distribution of Milk are appointinga sub-committee for the purpose  of settling the  immediate steps necessary for con-trolling  the  collection,  utilisation,  and distribution  of  milk  sold wholesale.  Thesub-committee will consist of representatives of the Ministry of Food, the Departmentsof Agriculture, and Local Government Boards for England and Wales and for Scotland,the Consumers&apos;  Council, and will include the Controller  of  Aircraft Finance; fourMembers  of  Parliament  have  been asked  to join the  Committee, viz., Sir BevilleStanier, Mr. Athelston Rendall, Mr. G. Stewart, and Mr. R. Harcourt.     Oil Seeds. A thousand  tons of linseed have  been purchased in the Argentine forshipment during April, but it has not yet been possible to secure any large quantitiesof this supply.  The price of oils and fats is rising in the United States of America sohigh as to interfere writh our imports, and it may be necessary to arrange writh theUnited States Government to control these prices.     Potatoes. The Food Controller has arranged with the Board of Agriculture thatthe minimum prices for  potatoes of the lowest quality  of the 1918 crop,  shall  beassessed  by a  Joint Committee  appointed from  the  Board of Agriculture  and theMinistry of Food.  As soon as the data as to the yield and quality in each districtare obtainable, the Committee wrill visit  each potato  district and  assess the prices,. after holding a local enquiry at which evidence will be taken from  representativefarmers as to yield, qualitj^, the cost of production, &amp;c, in the district.     Tea. Meetings have beeu held with the Tea Brokers&apos; Classification Committeeto arrange for regularity of supplies in the ballot.     A conference Avill shortly be held with representative China  tea importers  lodiscuss the handling of China tea bought on Government  account.
                                   -    5r    -Vegetable Markets: Lord  Rhondda has appointed  a Departmental  Committeeunder the chairmanship of Mr. P. 0.  Lawrence, K.C. :             &quot; To enquire  into  and  report upon the  conditions of  the  Fruit  and      Vegetable Markets within the  City and Metropolitan Police District of London,      and to recommend any measures that, in the opinion of the  Committee, would      tend to relieve congestion and prevent waste of food in the Markets, and would      conduce to  more rapid  and efficient handling of the Fruit  and  Vegetable      produce marketed in London.&quot;                            ORGANISED  DISTRIBUTION.  .    Diminution of Food Queues. The estimated  number of persons attending foodqueues in the Metropolitan Police area continues to show a satisfactory decline.    The comparative figures are as follows :  -Dates.	Monday.	Tuesday.	Wednesday.	Thursday. &apos; Friday. I	Saturday.18th to 23rd February 25th February to 2nd March 4th March to 9th March -11th March to 16th March	46,316 700 350 150	143,933 1,200 5,160 850	131,809 4,330 4,600 1,050	157,223 ! 317,158 6,900 j 67,335 6,740 j 23,046 3,375 7,700	542,953 110.565 23,972 8,380    The few queues remaining were chiefly in respect of unrationed articles.    Distribution.-A conference was held at Grosvenor House on  the  16th instant,with representatives of the various Food Commissioners to discuss the details of thearrangements for the distribution of margarine.     Many  reports of shortage and  unequal distribution of  margarine have beenreceived from the South-West of England and from South Wales.  A report from theWest of England makes prominent mention of unrest and  possibility  of troubleamong workers, particularly dockers, owing to      (1) Shortage of meat,  which they attribute to  profiteering, and holding up of           supplies.   The suggested remedy is that a definite public statement of the           facts relating to the shortage should be made.     (2) The large amount  of  mone3T raised  in the &quot;Business man&apos;s week&quot; which is           considered to support the general suspicion of profiteering.     It is reported from  the  Eastern  Counties that  the home  production is seriouslyaffected by the large earnings  of labour (at aerodromes,  &amp;c),  which not only attractnumbers of men from the farms, but create discontent among those who continue towork as agriculturists.  In anticipation of the  increased ration for manual workersthere has been a general demand for additional supplies of bacon, and also cheese.     Local  Food Control Committees. Twenty-five  fresh applications w^ere receivedduring  the week for  the enlargement  of  committees to  allow for additional  labourrepresentation.   Fifty-four cases in  all are now under consideration and in 32 casesduring  the week Orders were issued  sanctioning additions to committees, to  giveeffect to the policy of the Ministry.     Rationing. The returns of population rationed for the  several foodstuffs under-mentioned, up to to-day, are as follows :            Butter and Margarine -     -     -     -     -    -  30,948,800           Tea   --------    -  16,304,208           Meat ---------  15,489,607            Cheese     --------   l,89f-022            Lard ---------   1,198,548            Other commodities   -     -     -    -     -    -     228,542     On and after 5th May it is proposed to control the distribution and  sale of bacon.     After 7th April when meat  rationing becomes general the  Food  Controller expects to command  supplies which will  make it possible to supplement the  normal meat ration, by  an additional allowance of meat (other than butcher&apos;s meat or pork) to persons engaged in heavy bodily labour.  About 7,000,000 persons are expected to participate in this supplement.   For the  present it  is intended that  the supplement should be the same for all receiving it;  but to provide for contingencies which may                                                                          a a
arise hereafter, e.g., rationing of cereals, the workers are being divided into  threeclasses very heavy workers (e.(*.,  miners,  navvies, stokers, blast-fumacemen. &amp;c,heavy agricultural workers and  heavy industrial workers.   The necessary applicationforms and ration cards have been distributed to all Food Control Committees.    Transport. The Road  Transport Board have decided  to  create 13 DivisionalBoards whose areas correspond with the areas of the Divisional Food Commissioners.On these  Divisional Boards various  departments interested&quot; in  transport will berepresented.  These Boards, with the assistance of Local Advisory Committees, willdeal with  all questions  of road  transport in their division as well as with theallocation of petrol supplies.    Demands for  large additional  supplies of  petrol for milk collection have beenreceived by this Department.  As these demands are  mainly the outcome of coinpe-tition among varying interests, and  to grant them would not appreciably add  to theavailable supplies of milk,  it has  been  decided to  decline  applications  for recom-mendatiorjs unless  the  circumstances  are shown  to  be  exceptional.   Meantimeco-ordinated  collection by horse-drawn vehicles is being encouraged in view of theshortage of petrol.                            ENFORCEMENT  OF  ORDERS.    The total number of prosecutions reported fer  the week ending March 9th, 1918,in England, Scotland, and - Wales is 828-. (396 of  which were from London and theHome Counties),, and in Ireland  610, making a total  of  1,438,  Of these 1,318&apos;weresuccessful.  There were          164 prosecutions in connection with bacon, ham, and lard (of which 133                                              were in Ireland).                                            meat.                                            butter and margarine.                                            tea (80 of which were in Ireland).                                            potatoes (141 of which were in Ireland).    The average fine for Great Britain was 4Z. 15s. 2d., and for Ireland 12s..Qd.    On Wednesday, March 20, Mr.  Clynes  introduced  a  Bill  for increasing thepenalties against food profiteering.  The Bill provides for the forfeiture of double theamount received from the  sale of goods at prices  in excess  of  those  allowed bythe Food Controller.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.    The most noteworthy features of the following summary and tables are-      1.  The  improvement in  the  position  of cereal imports.  The  present  as          &apos; Compared with past figures are liable to be misleading unless the change           which has taken  place  in the proportions between wheat grain and           wheaten flour is borne in mind.  Flour now forms an increasing part of           the total; during the current week it was greatly in excess of grain.      2.  Foreign meat is more conspicuous in. the meat  supply than was  the case in           some part of last year.  This is relieving the pressure on home-fed stock,           and so diminishing the risk of slaughtering immature beasts.                                   IMPORTS.    There was  an improvement in imports last week due. to  heavier cereal arrivals.The total weight of the principal foods  imported  was .167,200 tons as compared with136,500 tons  the week before.  The corresponding figure,  excluding rice, for theweek ending March 17th, 1917 was 149,600 tons (Table A).    The  arrival of  wheat and flour  was 64,100 tons, an increase of 4,000 tons  onthe previous week.  Owing to the large share in this arrival, which  consists of flour,the amount is even greater than  is shown by  the figures.   Other cereals all showedsubstantial increases  with  the.  exception of maize  (practically  unchanged), theimport of rice having risen greatly.   The&apos; aggregate  of  all cereals,  including wheat,131150 91
                                 CONSUMPTION.    Meat-. Supplies  of home-fed meat at the four principal markets for the weekending March 9th, were 12 per cent, less than in the previous week and only 44 percent, of the- supplies in the corresponding week of 1917 (Table B).  An increase,however, in the supplies of, imported meat, more than made up the deficiency on theweek.  Of the total of meat, 5,132 tons, at these markets, 61 per  cent, was importedas compared with  46 per cent,  a  year ago.
