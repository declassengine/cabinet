,!s Docurnent Is the ProDsrtv ofrIntelligence Bureau,Department of Information,SECRET.IFW/030.WEEKLY  REPORT  OH  ITALY, XXX.(March 21st,  1918) Italy and  the subject-races of Austria-Hungary.    So many  Committees have recently  sprung  into  existence  in  connec- tion with  the Italo-Slav Entente  movement that it  may  be well  to enumerate  and distinguish them.    There is  (1) the General Committee for  the Liberation of the suppressed  Peoples of Austria with headquarters  at Rome composed  of the Senators Scialoja,  Ruffini and Dell- Torre;  the Deputies . Barzilai, Andrea  Torre  and Area,  with Amendola  (Rome editor of the Corriere della  Sera) and Maraviglia  (of the Idea Nazioaale)    (2)  The  international Socialist Committee presided  over by M. Albert  Thomas and having its headquarters  in Paris.  An account of this body  and its objects was given  in  Report on Italy XXVIII.  p.5.    (3)  A Committee recently formed in Italy, having for its special object  the preparation  of an understanding  between Italy and  the Jugoslavs,   The Committee is not  yet complete but  the  following are among its  members - Signora Battisti (widow of the Irredentist victim ox  Austrianvindictiveness);  Gaetano Salveneinini  (Professor  of.;.History at Florence, Editor of L rUnita^ and  opponent of Italian claims to  Dalmatia);   Guglieemo Ferrero  (the historian);   Mario Borsa (Editor of II  Secolo);  Luigi Einaudi (Professor of Economics); the Deputies Agnelli, Se Viti de Marco,  Area, Marchesano,  Celli,  Ciriani, and the ex-Food Commissioner, Canepa.    Signor  Canepa  interviewed by LTEpoca, explained that this  newly formed  Committee  was in no sort of opposition or rivalry with  other Eommittees;  that it^did not adopt as its  aim the  dismemberment of Austria-Hungary(&quot;a dsngerous phrase&quot;) but  the liberation from op- prcssion by Germans, Magyars, and the Habsburg Dynasty of  the  Italian
Slovene,  Rumanian,  etc.  populations;  that it did not assume toitself any plenipotentiary character still less did it feel itselfauthorised to proclaim renunciations on the part of Italy.  It merelyaimed at  co-operating with a corresponding Jugoslav Committee inworking out an understanding ,i   It is  obvious nevertheless that  this new Committee is of predomin-!antly Radical character and comprises all the most prominent opponentsof the claims to Balrnatia;  whereas the Rome Committee is of a mixedcharacter and contains a considerable element of the ParliamentaryRights   Certain journals have  been trying to make the most of thiscontrast  in political complexion between the two Italian Committees.Hence Signor Canepa&apos;s disavowal of any opnosition between them.   On the Jugoslav Committee with which the Italian Committee is toconfer in some Swiss town are the Serbian ex-Ministers Stoianovii,Hare? Tripeovid and Petrovic;  the Serbian Radical Deputies Pavlovic,Jankavle, Georgevic;   the young Radicals Prodanovic and $ulovie;  theProgressist Karincovic and the  Socialists Urosevic and Voia ?zeeovie.   Dr. Andrea Torre (Deputy, Pseaedent of the -?ress Association andformerly Foreign Editor of the  Corriere della Sera) has recently beenin London as representative of  the Rome Committee (11 o.1. in enumera-tion) charged to confer with the principal representatives of theoppressed nationalities and to  establish preliminary agreements withthem in view of a Conference which  is shortly to be heifcd at Rome.  Thesemi-official communique on the subject reported that Dr. Torre hadmet Dr. Ante Trumbic (President of the London Jugoslav Committee) andthat after exhaustive discussion an agreement was reached, based onthe principles recognised by both parties.   Dr. Trumbic, it is under-stood, is shortly to visit Rome on the invitation of the ItalianPremier,  with whom, it will be remembered, he recently had a conver-sation^^The Conference shortly to take place in Rome is to be atten-ded by representatives of the oppressed nationalities of Austria-
                                             s                            - 3 -Hungary, of the Jugoslav Committee, and of Italian Parliamentarycircles;  representatives of the Allied Countries, it is understood,will also take part.   Considerable importance is attached to thismeeting.   What bearing the recent crisis in the Serbian Cabinet mayhave upon the work of the Conference is not yet clear.   The journals which support the anti-Austrian movement give nruohspace to accounts of the persecution to which the Jugoslavs are beingsubjected by Austria, and are urgent in demanding the enrolment dinthe Italian Army of the Czech and Slav prisoners in Italy,  It ap-pears that the Italian Foreign Office is still persisting in its op-position to this step, requested by the Serbian Prime Minister andsupported by both British and French Governments,Military,   The Italian press gives a good deal of prominence to articlesrecently published by the Military critics of the Echo de Parisand Le Matin discussing the probability of an Austro-German offensivecn the western section of the Italian front and describing the dis-tribution of the Austrian forces on the front.   The Corriere della Sera addresses an urgent request to the Govern-ment to take more efficient measures to counteract at the front theinsidious and persistent efforts being made by the enemy to undermineby means of skilfully concocted leaflets and news-sheets the moralof the Italian soldier and to create distitust and dislike of the                                                          ofAllies.   The Austrian propaganda is said to be no longer/the crudekind experienced in the early days of the invasion but exceedinglywell and skilfully organised with co-operation of journalists wellacquainted with internal conditions in Italy,  who mkke a full use ofall &quot;defeatist1 utterances in the Italian andJfAllied press.   Howfar this propaganda is effecting its object it is hard to ascertain.What reports we have of the moral  of the Italian army are re-assuring.
   A movement is being set on foot for organising propaganda amongthe Czechs and Slavs of the A-ggitrian army, its aim being to diffuseamong them the knowledge of Italy&apos;s new oolicy of solidarity withthe subject races of Austria-Hungary.Silk Export.   The silk-export scandal forms &amp;m chief subject of discussion inthe press.   ^SEKSS apoearj to have wide ramifications and furtherarrests are reported at frequent intervals,    There is a dispositionin certain quarters to hold the Government and in particular theMinister of Finance, Signor Meda (Catholic)  responsible,The Vatican,   The Osservatore Romano (March 13th) contradicts the statementmade by he Matin and reproduced in Italian papers that the Vaticanas endeavouring to suggest to the United States a way towards peace,Economic,   Signor Salvatore Orlando has been appointed Commissioner forMercantile Ship-building and representative of Italy in London onthe Inter-Ally Committee for Maritime Transport.
