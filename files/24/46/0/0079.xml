(This  DocurrHis  Britannic^operty  ofGovernment)Confidential.f 11*3)UR  POSITION  IN  MUNITION  INDUSTRIES.               (27th March 1918.)    I circulate the following notes which  have been  prepared in the  Intelligenceand  Statistics Section  of the  Ministry  of  Munitions  on the labour  position inmunition industries.                                                 WINSTON S  CHURCHILL.                              I.-MAN POWER.Mobilisation of Released Soldiers.    Measures  on the lines  described in these Notes for the 27th February for  themobilisation on an emergency of released soldiers at work in munition factories  arenow being taken.   Not  only soldiers who  have been  &quot;released&quot; (retaining theiruniform), but soldiers who, after being  posted  to  a unit, have been transferred asArmy Reserve Munition Workers, are  being  instructed to report  at certain militarycamps for medical examination.  Any man not classified as fit for general service willbe returned at once to civilian employment.  These men are  most of them  highlyskilled, but they have  all had some  military training, and  can,  therefore, be madeavailable for active service more quickly than raw recruits.    Steps are  also being  taken  to accelerate as  much  as  possible the calling up ofcivilians from munitions work.                                II. STRIKES.Statistics for the Week ending the 20th March.    During  the week  ending the 20tli March  36,635 working days or J of  1 percent, of the possible wnrking time were lost through  strikes  on munition work.Twenty-one strikes were settled.  At the end of the week six strikes were in progress,involving 2,628 workers ;  at the end of tlie^previous week the number of workers onstrike was 3,417.    Few new strikes were reported between the  20th and 25th March, and on thelatter day only six strikes were intimated as being in progress.The Threatened Strike of Engineers.    Threats of a strike on the man-power question, which, if carried out, would haveseriously menaced the output of munitions, were made  in  Manchester just as theGerman offensive was beginning.  At first there were indications that members of theA.S.E.  in other centres might support  the  unofficial lead  given  at the Manchestermeeting, which was attended by representatives from many centres throughout thecountry; and  the official attitude of the Society seemed  invertebrate.   As the battleon the  Western front developed, however, not only did the Executive Council of theA.S.E.  repudiate the  unofficial  action  taken, but  the  Arrangements  Committeeappointed by the  Manchester meeting  called the strike  off, and appealed  to allmembers of the A.S.E. &quot; to remain at work and to  use every effort to replace the&quot; losses sustained during the present offensive.&quot;    The reaction against  any suggestion of  a  strike  at the present  time  seemsoverwhelming.   In  the- most influential Labour  newspaper (The  Herald,  30.3.18),Mr. Brailsford writes :-       &quot; The most pacifist among us to-day are the least pro-German.&quot;    The editor, Mr. George Lansbury, says :        &quot; When either Miners or Engineers put  up a  claim that they may be exempt           while others are pushed into the inferno, I cannot help  pointing out that           this is a sort of selfishness which means ruin both for the present and the           future.&quot;    A  (33)5193  Pk 20  125  3/18  E &amp; S
    Mr.  G. D. H. Cole, of the National Guilds League, and Mr. W. H. Hutchinson amember  of the  A.S.E.  Executive,  in  a joint article which  blames the Governmentfreely for labour troubles, declare that:        &quot;There must be no strike  during the present crisis.   Only one, thing could           justify a strike to-day :  a reasoned determination on the part of a majority           of the people  to end the war  at any cost.  That determination, we know           well,  does not exist.&quot;Abandonment of Easter Holidays.    The response to the  Ministers appeal to munition workers to forgo  a holidayat Easter has met with  an&apos; entirely satisfactory response in all  important munitioncentres.  In so  far as  they  are required to  work, they  will  receive the usual ratepaid for holiday work during the war period.  Where no  customary rate for holidaysis recognised, time-and-a-quarter will be paid  for work  done on  Good  Friday  andEaster Monday.                                III. WELFARE.     Nearly a thousand welfare supervisors  are  now  at  work  in  British factories.Many of these have been appointed from the  Ministry&apos;s panel, but the majority havebeen selected by individual firms.     Reactionary views are still expressed by some employers.  The general managerof a  very important engineering establishment in the  North of  England&apos;:i:&apos; is quoted asfollows ::        Some boys must remain uneducated to do the menial work.       Welfare work destroys individuality of character. .       A boy with a smattering of  education is a  dangerous person and becomes an         agitator.       Welfare work may survive so long as the expenditure upon welfare is permitted         to be paid out of excess profits.     Such trade union opposition as exists is based upon the belief that welfare super-visors,  as  paid  officials of the firm,  will tend to side with  the  management in acrisis, will be mainly interested in  increasing  output, and may act as spies on  theworkers.     Summing up the conclusions of quarterly reports  lately received  from all districts,the Director of the Welfare Section writes :      &quot; In every respect substantial improvement is recorded which cannot fail to have         reacted upon the health and vigour  of the operatives, and so upon the quality         and quantity of the output and  upon what is  of considerable importance         at the  present  moment,  that nervous irritability known as Industrial         Unrest.&quot;* The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company, Limited.
