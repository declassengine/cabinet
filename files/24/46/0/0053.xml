i-U4S, J i&apos;RATIONS.OF THE HOME ARMYIT x;o0l            &apos; andXff^guTPLIES FOR n THE NAVY AND ARMY CANTEEN BOARD/ PC?/(J45   Memorandum by the Army Council             onMemorandum by Mr. Austen Chamberlain          G.T. 3990.          Mr. Austen Chamberlain raises three questions in hisMemorandum.1.   That the Home Service Ration  is excessive  in quantity     and variety as compared with the food of the ordinary     eivilian.     2.   That the Army ration should be reduced accordingly by          four ounces of meat or the equivalent in canteen          supplies.     3.   That there should be differentiation in stales  for          various classes of soldiers serving at Home.          At the outset &quot;the Army Council desire to place on recordtheir considered opinion that the proposals contained in Mr.Chamberlain1 s Memorandum in&apos; common with the Memoranda G.T.3790and GfT.3985 by Sir Alfred Mond and Lord Rhondda respectivelyraise grave issues affecting . &quot;the morale of the Army,  theimportance of which can in their view only be correctlyappreciated by those responsible for the state of the MilitaryForces. &apos;          It is therefore the duty of the Army Council to request^  .that they be fully consulted on any projected decision on tktflrproposals in order that its effect on the troops may be fullyappreciated by the War Cabinet before any definite ruling isgiven.          Taking the points raised seriatim:     1.   The comparison instituted by Mr.  Chamberlain betweenthe soldier&apos;s ration and that of the ordinary civilian has  infact no validity?in that the soldier is rationed in every articleof his diet whereas the civilian is only restricted in certaincommodities.          To assert therefore that the oivilian is  limited  to2,700 calories is entirely fallacious,  since  there  is  nothingto prevent the civilian purchasing those articles,which are notrationed by the Food Controller.in any quantities he desires orcan afford.          The soldier is very differently situated.     His  wholemode of life is legislated  for;   his liberty is restricted and.as regards his meals he has to conform to a daily programme whichhe cannot as an individual vary. -His pay is small and he  cannotafford to buy expensive substitutes,  nor ean  he, like the worker,                                                         strike
strike for increase^ of wages.    Fo such restrictions are placedon the ordinary civilian^,  who has no restrictions on hisliberty; he can live how and where he likes:   he can and doesstrike for increase of wages when it suits him;  if he cannotget one form of food he makes it up with another:  and he isonly &quot;rationed&quot; in a few essential articles.          It is therefore clear that Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s comparisonis based on the assumption that interior economy in the HomeArmy is comparable with that obtaining in civil  life whereasin fact no such comparison is possible.     2.   The Army Council are well aware that circumstancesmay arise dictating the necessity of further reduciing the HomeService Scale of Rations,, but they hold very strongly to theview that these circumstances must be shown to be imperativebefore they are justified in disregarding the adviee tenderedby the scientists of the Royal Army Medical Corps.          The whole history of the rations scale during thewar has been one of constant consideration and revision tomeet altered circumstances and resources, and the presentHome Service Scale  has been fixed at a level below which theCouncil&apos;s medical advisers have not heretofore considered itsafe to go.          If the reductions suggested by Mr. Chamberlain or anyportion of them are decided by the War Cabinet to be a necessityin view of the general food position, the question of theprovision of suitable substitutes will have to be a matter ofarrangement between the Army Council and the Food Controller-          The Council.are therefore not in a position to expressany opinion on the feasibility of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s suggestedreduction until the War Cabinet have ruled, as to the degree ofnecessity,and the Council have had an opportunity of consultingtheir medical advisors, and arranging rrith the Pood Controlleras tn the provision of the necessary substitutes.     3.   The difficulties of differentiation of scales forvarious classes of soldiers serving at home are possib\ly notappreciated by those unfamiliar with Army Administration.          In anticipation of the present meat shortage anattempt was recently made by the Army Council to adopt twoscales of rations for troops at Home;differentiating betweenthe following two classes :-    (a)   Troops under training or otherwise in preparation for          service overseas and mobile formations actually          employed in Home Defence.    (b)   All other troops at Home.          Instructions were issued that the ration of class (b)should be reduced as fellows :-          Meat from    12 ozs.  to 8 ozs.          Sugar from    3  &quot;   to 1  w          Bacon from    2  &quot;   to 1  &quot;          Tea from        oa.  to 3/8 oz.          Following upon this order the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Home Forces made representations in the strongestterms to the War Office, that the differentiation not only proved                                                        impossible
 impossible  in  practice but was  also  dangerous in the interests of discipline.   He  stated that he had been rung up by every Command  in  the Kingdom and General Officers had come personally to protest  and represent  their  difficulties.   Briefly these difficulties were  that in almost  every Barrack room in the Kingdom  there  are  different  classes  of men with the result that in every central messing  there  were  men entitled to different scales of food, and  it is quite impossible in practice to serve the meals out  in varying  proportions.          Again in every  barrack  roonithere are men returned from the fighting areas who have  been wounded or are in impaired health.   They are men who came voluntarily forward earlier in the war  and have submitted to all forms of privations, and they naturally resent being now put  on a  lower scale than the last joined recruit dragged into  the Service against his will. Instances of this  kind could be multiplied, but it is enough to say that the   difficulties are  so great that the Pi eld Marshal is not prepared to take the  responsibility of attempting to differentiate  in the manner  proposed.          The  order was accordingly  cancelled and the flat rate of 10 ozs.  of  meat for all Troops at Home (except A.4. boys, who remain  at  12 ozs) was adopted.           A   usual form  of  criticism is that which is directed against  Military Clerks,  but the difficulty of differentiation may be illustrated by the following  example :&apos;-          A Military Office  may contain 20 clerks,  ofjrhom, say, 10  are married and 10 unmarried, 5 of the former are fweessible to  their families  and accordingly live at home,  the other 15 are attached for rations  and accommodation to the nearest Infantry Battalion^ * However much we might wish to took for these men and  serve their food  separately it could never be done, their reduced  ration goes into&apos;  the pool with the other thnusand rations  and the differentiation is lost.   There is in addition the anomaly of two different scales of rations among the 20 clerks serving  in  $he same office,   as well aB a penalty placed on any battalion of Infantry that may have &quot;sedentary&quot;  soldiers attached to  it.          whatever may be the decision of the war Cabinet on the points  raised in Mr.  Chamberlains Memorandum,  the Army Council,  as responsible for the discipline and welfare of the Army consider^ it their  duty to reiterate their opening remarks so  that  there  can be no possibility of the aspect of the question, as  affecting the morale of the Home Army,  being  lost sight of.          It must be remembered that the soldier &amp; compelled by law to serve,   and the  cnrollary of this obligation is equitable treatment by his employer - the State.    The State  hns no  more  right  to take advantage of the soldier&apos;s position than a parent has to take advantage of the helpless position of a child.   Part of the definite understanding   with the  soldier is that he  should be properly fed by the State.   He has in many cases surrendered lucrative  occupations,  and with all  the restrictions on his liberty and pay,  he  cannot live with  or near his  family,  nor contribute towards  theM  maintenance a8  hewould wish.    Apart altogether from considerations  of health, it would seem dangerous  and  gratuitous provocation  to reduce him to  the barest standard of existence,  so  long as  there  is  any choice in the matter, especially while the r,iv:llian can eat asmuch as his  purse allows.   Finally there  are  reasons which need not be mentioned here, which, in the  opinion of  the Army  Council,would make any tampering with the soldier&apos;s  moderate standard of comfort aa\ undertaking  fraught with  danger  to the  stability  of the Home  Army.
