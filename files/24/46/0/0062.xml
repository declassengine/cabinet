166IIS DOCUMENT  IS  TK3  PRQPSBTY OF HIS BBIMIIC ^JBErTS SOVSRHMSKT ).C H 1.  .                WAR   I? A B I K i f.-405$.              PROPOSED MILITARY SERVICE BILL,       Memorandum by the President of the Local GoTernment Beard.      It  is  obvious that in the present emergency men must be obtained, and obtained quickly,  and the House of Commons end the general public will go  far towards giving powers to the Government,  but I ds not think they will be prepared to give the autocratic powers suggested by the  Minister of National Service, especially if men oan be obtained quickly without such extremis  measures.      The proposal of the Minister of National Service is to  abeliaa all exemptions  and all the statutory grounds  for claiming exemption. tiz:- occupation,  hardship,  health, and conscientious objection; also to dia-establish  the Tribunals,  looal, appeal and central.   Is their place to  render  liable to military service all persons within the prescribed  ages with a right to the Minister of national Servioa to gxempt whom  he  will,    IPor his guidance local bodies,  based on the existing Appeal Tribunals are to act in an advisory capacity. These it is presumed will hear claims for exemption,  but the deoisicm of the claims will lie with the representative of the national Service Ministry,,     My alternative proposal is a Bill which  would provide that claims for  exemption should go directly to the Appeal Tribunals thus abolishing  local  tribunals and cutting out one stage  in the  present procedure.    This  would secure that oases are decided promptly. Furthermore,  as the members of the appeal tribunals are appointed by the Crown, this system could also,  if necessary,  be applied to Ireland.      Some modifications of detail to  secure the speeding up  of the machinery (particularly If the age of conscription is extended, and largig numbers of  men are  brought within the soopt of  the  Acts) earn  . be  discussed with the  Minister of National Service.     The soheme of the  Minister of National Service is open  to the following objections I-     1.   It  involve!  at  a time when  expedition is of the greatest     moment,  the  complete alteration  of machinery which is well     understood and is  working satisfactorily,  and the setting up      of new machinery,  new bodies,  new regulations and new prinoi-     plts.     2.   It  means tho  abolition of the principle under which a     clais  fer  exemption is adjudicated on by &amp; representative be&amp;f^&quot;      in favour  of adjudication by a Minister  or a Government      representative *    In the United  States,  ia Canada and in flaw      Zealand, where conscription is in force,  all claims  come before      an independent tribunal - not before a Government offioial.     ^      She change from democracy to bureaucracy or aatecraoy will be      sharpy Criticised.      3*   If the  appeal tribunals oonsent to  act as advisory bodies      they will  in their loss responsible position be  likaly  to be      less strict  than  they havs been  in the past,  leaving the ediun      of refusing  exemption in the harder cases to the Minister.
- a4*   Hitherto Kinistore questioned  as to  the  harshness ofdeoisions in individual cases have  always been able  to reply tfe,all the facts have been before the  tribunal and  if the tribunalwas a local tribunal, that there was an appeal frea  their deeisjfrom the point of riew of the Government  the  buffer  of thetribunal has been of great value.   Under the system proposed,the whole responsibility rests with the Minister and he will itbombarded not only with applications for  exemption but withenquiries why such and such  a man  has not been  exempted whileanother less hard case has received exemption.6*   The abolition of the statutory grounds for  exemption iscertain to meet with much opposition in the House of Commons.and unless I am much mistaken, to a strong demand for theinclusion in the Bill of clauses showing  on what grounds exemptcan under the new scheme be claimed.   This will inevitably leaito much discussion.     It must always be remembered that the vast mass  of  young menwhose exemption causes pretests, and who would be  of  use to  the Arisyare exempted not by the tribunals at all but by Departmental actionthrough being in protected industries.   This, and not the tribunalexemptions, is the crux of the question.   The Minister  of SationalService has power, under Seetion Z of the Military Serrioe Aot, 1918to withdraw certificates ef exemption from any of  these  men.     I am confident that tht plan I suggest while  being  more palatalto the House of Commons and the Country will produce  as  many fit menand as quickly.W.BAYE8 ]?ISHER.
