HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HI3 BRIim*I(besquilles^S S C B 2 T. Copy llo... fO.P.-a202.&apos; 0 A B I It ETiTHIRD INTERIM REPORT,. 1.    The Cabinet Committee on Unemployment havo had under consideration tho stops to be taicen for tho relief of unemployment in those areas whoso needs aro not met by the schemes for the construction of arterial roads and other proposals recommended in tho First and Second interim reports of the Committee (CP. 190? and CP. 2145 respectively)There will be? many districts which the road schemes either do not touch gt all or for which the relief provided will bo wholly inadequate.The Committee are of opinion that *in those areas where unemployment is severe tho Government will ultimately bo compelled to give assistance in some form.2.     There are the following alternatives(1)   To encourage Local Authorities t* undertake works of public utility in their districts:(2)   To rely on the machinery provided by the Unemployed Workmen Act 1905, viz. the establishment in the affected areas of central unemployed bodies and local dis-tress committees, with the function of preparing registers of unemployed and setting up reliof wor,.:s   the cost over the value of the work done being- met by a Parliamentary grant5 with such voluntary contributions as may be obtainable,3.     The maohinery provided lj the Unemployed WorkmenAct 190.5 is unsatisfactory.   Tho relief schemes set upby     Distress Committees under the Act would not be of so useful a character as the urgent public wor&amp;s whicheoulrl
could bo undertaken by Local Authorities if finance wore available.     Moreover, under the Act money raised from the rates cannot be used for the provision of work. 4.,   On the other hand the Ministry of Health have pre-pared, at the su^ostion of the Committee, a - schedule of works of public utility which would be undertaken by Local Authorities throughout the country if money wore available. (Typos of these are shown in Ajpen/lix I. ).     In the present financial conditions some Local Authorities are unable to borrow, but the Committee ore informed that a large number of the Authorities concerned ecu ,d raise the necessary money for these works and are prepared to put some or all ox them in hand if Government financial assistance were forthcoming. 5.     The Committee are of opinion that the Government should contribute, in the form of a Parliamentary Grant, the amount by which any such scheme, if duly ap-roved, exceeds what the same won-: would cost if carried out by ordinary labour instead of unemployed labour -estimated at 30^L.In arriving at this conclusion the Committee are influenced by the precedent set up before the &apos;.&apos;ar in the administration of -Schemes under the Unemployed Workmen Act 1905 under which the excess over the value of the work  done was met out of parliamentary Grant,
6.     The Oommltteo therefore recommend to the Cabinet(1) To authorise grantn to LooalAuthorities for schemes of work in relief of unemployment submitted through the appropriate Government Department to the Cabinet Unemploy-neht Oommitteo and approved by that Oommltteo - to the extent of not more than 30$ on the wages bill for the additional number of men employed by the Local Authority concerned.(S) That the Unemployment Committed before approving any scheme shall consider and compare with it any road Work or other scheme for the - relief of unemployment already being undertaken or about to bo undertaken in the district.(3) (a) That tho unskilled labour employed shall consist of men, recruit ^d through the Labour Exchanges according to priority if registration, that no other unemployed labour should be used so long as ox-service men are available, and that no man should be taken on unless he has been unemployed for at least 7 days.(b) That the names of men sfe employed should be kopt on the live registers at the Labour Exchanges and separato-ly identified so that they may be notified from time to time of suitable vacancies of a more permanent character.(4) That in the case *f works extending &amp;var a period of yfars tho oentribu-tion from the Exohequor being given solely for the purpose of relieving unemployment, should cease as soon as employment is normal.7.     There will no doubt bo districts inwhich no schemes ef tho kind referred to abovare undertaken.     The Committee will be glad to have the guidance of tho Cabinet on the question of policy whether in such areas themaohinery of Distress Oommittooe and Unemployed Bodies provided under the UnemployedWorkmen Act 1905 should bo encouraged.
When thin was done the Government would no doubt find it impossible to resist a demand for a parliamentary grant to finance the relief work undertaken.    A charge on the rates is precluded by the Statute and there is no other way in which thin work can be financed except by voluntary contributions.     If the Committees recommendations (paragraph 6 above) for thfl subsidising of works by Local Authorities is approved by the Cabinet, it will bo possible to make it a condition that no parliamentary grant is given in respect of the Unemployed. Workmen Act 1905 in any district whoro a scheme has been undertaken by the Local Authorities for the relief of the Unemployed, to the cost of which the Government contributes.A decision on the matter is urgently necessary.      As willII /be seen from the attached letter (Appendix /the Ministry of Health are already being pressed by the Central Unemployed Body of London to make an announcement by December 2nd regarding the functions and future work of that body.8o     In making the above recommendations the Committoe desire to draw-attention to the fact that they have only been dealing with the unemployed problem from thR aspect, of relief and wish to record their opinion that the only adequate solution is in the revival of trade, a matter which they understand is engaging the attention of another Committee.(Initialed)     L.W.S.a, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 550th November, 1920.

Sir,

I am directed to advert to your letter of the 27th October, to my letter of the 5th instant, and to the subsequent conference at the Ministry of Health on the afternoon of the 12th November, and to request that the Ministry may be good enough to forward the further promised communication as regards the functions to be undertaken by the Central Body by the 2nd proxime.

I am directed again to remind the Ministry of the long period of time during which the Central Body have anxiously pressed for a decision as to their future work. The Chairman of the Body instructs me to repeat the extreme need of an immediate announcement, - the necessity for which he also impressed upon Sir Arthur Robinson and Mr. Francis on the 12th instant, - inasmuch as in view of the urgent representations made to the Central Body from many sources, it will be necessary in their own interests to take such steps as they think advisable in order that the present position of the Central Body, and the prolonged negotiations that have taken place to induce a definite pronouncement as to their future work, may be clearly made known.
