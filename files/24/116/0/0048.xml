It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919, it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent.in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :  Per cent.To the end of January   ...        ...        ...        ... . v ... 2-9February ...        ...        ...        ... ... ... 1-6March     ...        ...        ...        ... ... ... 1-1April      .................. 0-9May        ...        ...        ...        ... ... ... 11June       ...        ...        ...        ... ... ... 1-2July................ ... 1-4August    ...        ...        ...        ... ... ... 1-6September ...        ...        ...        ... - ... ... 2-2October ... ... ... ... 53NVmbers on Registers of Employment Exchanges.	1920.

The position in the pottery and mining industries is reported to be favourable.II.

Bristol. The lay-out work on the Fishponds and Sea Mills Sites is practically completed. The Council, however, propose to put in hand lay-out work on the Knowle Site, which it is estimated will employ about 150 men. Adjacent to the Housing Sites at Sea Mills and Shirehampton is the Avonmouth low level road.A contract for a further section of this road is to be put in hand shortly. This will employ 300 men, but it is not clear whether these will not be largely the same men at present employed on the road by the Corporation, (about 280).The Council are dubious as to whether they can contemplate further commit-ments on their financial resources, which are within sight. Their application to raise further money by stock has not been favourably entertained.Exeter. The Town Council expect to make an early start with the Buddie Lane lay-out. Possibly in four weeks&apos; time tenders will be in. This work will employ about 120 men, and will last about nine months.Exmoutli. The Council anticipate that their lay-out work will absorb 20 men for ten or twelve weeks, but the commencement of this work depends entirely on the acquisition of the site. The Council are hesitating to make a compulsory purchase order in this case.Glastonbury B. The Council say that a small number of unemployed in the town are likelyto be slightly absorbed with the lay-out, but give no figures.Kingswood (near Bristol). The Council contemplate employing direct labour on the lay-out of Hanham very shortly. This will employ about 50 men for five or six weeks.Paignton. St. Michael&apos;s lay-out will give work for 30 men for six months. It is hoped to commence the work when the contract is signed.Plymouth. The Mount Gold lay-out is practically completed, and a first section of the North Prospect lay-out is in a very advanced state, about 140 men are being employed on this first section and the Council have urged upon the contractors that ex-Service men should, as far as possible, be employed. The second section of the North Prospect lay-out is likely to be put in hand shortly. The tenders are being considered by the Council. The estimated cost is just over  60,000 for roads and sewers.   The third and last section is at present only in plan stage.Pooie. Hamworthy will give work on road widening for 12 men for about a week. The Fernside Site will absorb 20 men on the making of a new road and laying of sewers for three months.- Wimborne Road Site will employ 12 men on new sewers for twelve months.St. Ives T.C. The Town Council hope that the lay-out work on their site will absorb about 20 men for six months, and will be started about the 1st January.Salisbury T.C. The Town Council have a scheme to employ ex-Service men on the erection of concrete houses independently of any lay-out work.Tavistock V.D.C. This iay-out provides for six men for three or four months, but this work is already in hand.Trowbridge U.D.C. The Council state that they have about 30 unemployed ex-Service men in the town, and their Gloucester Road lay-out will absorb about that number for three months.Westbury U.D.C. (Wilts). Lay-out work is practically completed on the Haines Lane Site, but the Council are disposed favourably to consider special construction to absorb the unemployed. They are also likely to look for another site for additional houses, and this will mean lay-out work.   No figures are available.[No particulars of the number of men employed.]
