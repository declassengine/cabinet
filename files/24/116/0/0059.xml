Its. entlretyQ.1\T ever the less the-mission entrusted with the decision in this natter allocated to the Polish Republic a strip of territory 60 metres wide on the right banli of the Vistula.Naturally we have no idea of trespassing in the sphere of poMtiof-j but we are instructed to safeguard on every occasion the interests of the Trades Union movement, and In view of tho fact that - measures of this nature are detrimental to those interests^ we believe that it is our duty to protest against this infringement of the Treaty of Versailles.Tho separation of tho district in question from  astern and Western Prussia and the cession of a part of the province of Posmania allocated to Poland without a plebiscite is manifestly detrimental to the Trades Union movement,, which has developed in the course of years upon this territory and had seourou important advantages to the wording classeSoPersons who have been Members for years now find them-selves separated, from their German Trades Unions and all the sacrifices which they had made with a view to the future have thus resulted iii&apos;.nothing but loss to them0In
In order to assist the members to its utmost power, the German Federation of Trades Unions has resolved to pay sick and unemployment benefit, etc., until December 31st next, as the Polish Trades Unions do not possess sufficient influence, and do not dispose of the necessary resources to enable them to undertake these payments.

The censorship in Poland renders it impossible to correspond with the members of our Unions. Verbal reports which are absolutely reliable prove that these Unions are reduced by at least one half of their former strength.

If this threat to the existence of the Trades Unions&apos; organisation in the districts across the border is to continue, the arbitrary incorporation of a German population with that of Poland, where the labour organisations are considerably loss well developed than in the Central European countries, will create for the latter a situation in which it may be difficult to maintain wages at their present level, in consequence of the influx of Polish workers, who would accept wages below the standard rates, and thus add to the difficulties of the Trades Union movement. For this reason we request you to take the necessary measures to protect the well organised workers of Europe against the disastrous consequences to which we have drawn your attention.

(Translation).Federation Syndic ale Internationale, AmsterdamNovember 3rd, 19HO.7978.$o the Council ofThe League of nations,. Geneva.Gentlemen,Following upon our letter of September 22 in whioh we as.:od you for the reparation of the injustice to Germany committed by the ceding to Poland of the right bank of the Vistula for a length of 45 kilometres and width of 50 metres, we have the honour to bring to your knowledge tho fact that .we have learnt that Earl Curzon of Ke&amp;loston expressed his opinion in London before one of&quot; our representatives that this illegal act was based upon paragraph 97 of the Treaty of Versailles, the wording of this   paragraph convinces us&apos; that this action could not be based upon the Article in question which runs as follows:-&quot;The principal illied and Associated powers will thon fix tho. frontier between East Prussia and Poland in this region leaving in any csee to Poland for the wholo of the section bordering on the Vistula full and complete control of the river including the east bank a8 far east of the river as may be necessary for its regulation and improvement.&apos;&quot;It is clear in feet from this Article that the control of tho river had to bo guaranteed and that the measures; neeossary for the exercise of this control had to be taken , but that there was no oxpressad stipulation that a part of the bank should be ceded to Poland in order to render possible this control.   This cession cannot in consoquence be based upon the article in question.Tho proiont case, therefore, must be regarded as ono of the many illegal interpretations - which, have latterly been given to the Treaty of Peace;   and in view of the fact, which was pointed out in our last letter,, that this action is detrimental to our interests, we request you to be good enough to revoice the decision that was taken.We have tha honour to remain;-, etc. ,(Signed)   J-.Oudogeo.sf.
