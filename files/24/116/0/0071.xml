memorandum by secretary of state for the colonies.cp,the official secrets bill now before the houseofficial secrets bill.of commons appears to have been drafted mainly with an eye to the conditions of the united kingdom.  for instance, clause 5 deals with so purely a domestic matter as the regulation of accommodation addresses.principal act of 1911 and this act was expressed to extend to the whole empire, including the self-governing dominions. consequently we shall, if the bill passes in its present form, be legislating for the self-governing dominions.the act of 1911 being applied to the dominions and which induced the dominions to acquiesce in such application, it is now a well-established rule that parliament does not legislate for the internal affairs of the self-governing dominions. there is nowadays no theme on which ministers and constitu-tional authorities in the dominions express themselves with greater emphasiB than the denial of any constitutional, as apart from a legal, right in the imperial parliament to legislate for the dominions and it may be regarded as certain that dominion governments would not remain passive if the present measure were made applicable to these countries., -following new clause should be inserted after clause 9::-mthe principal act and this act shall not apply to any part of the self-governing dominions, that is to say, the dominion of canada, the commonwealth of australia (which for this purpose shall be deemed to include papua and norfolkbut the bill has to be read as one with thewhatever may have been the reasons which led toin these circumstances i have suggested that the island
Island), tho Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and Newfoundland.&quot;The War Office have urged that it is of the greatest importance from the point of view of Imperial defence that uniform and up-to-date legislation of this kind should be operative throughout the Empire but I am afraid that this would be no answer to the protests of the Dominions.The War Offioe have also suggested that the Bill should be allowed to go through as a measure applicable to the Dominions and that the question&quot; of the Dominions passing their own legislation should be deferred for discussion at the next Imperial Conference.    I do.not regard this as a practicable suggestion.    On the oontrary, it would be deplorable if one of the matters to be disoussed at the forthC-coming Conference was the passing of an enactment of so unconstitutional a character.In these circumstances I trust that my colleagues will authorise the amendment of the Bill in the manner which I have proposed.M.9th December, 1920.
