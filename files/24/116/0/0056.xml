S. C.The War Office,7 th December, 1920.A. Mechanical Transport.1. The following table shows the military mechanical transport in Ireland on the 31st March, 1920, and the subsequent increases which have been made.The policy which has been followed is that demands from the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, are met with the utmost possible speed.As will be seen, already since the 31st March, 1920, the mechanical transport in Ireland has been more than doubled, and in fact additional transport over and above the demands of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, has, at the suggestion of the War Office, been provided : &apos;Military Mechanical Transport in Ireland on 31st March, 1920, and shipped there or in process of being shipped since that date.-	Lorries.

Some of these are now past repair, but roughly 25 are running. Since then 48 armoured cars (Peerless) have been sent. A further six are being sent on the 8th December, while six of the new Rolls-Royce armoured cars due from factory next week will be despatched on receipt. 16 more Peerless armoured lorries (from the 32 retained in England for emergencies) are being sent in the course of December, and 26 new Rolls-Royce armoured cars as delivery can be obtained. A further 16 Peerless will be despatched later if situation in Great Britain permits.(B20/-191)   100   12/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.   8770wo
23. Experiments in armouring Ford cars have shown their unsuitability for military purposes. It is not yet known if the Royal Irish Constabulary will accept this type  the experiments were carried out for the Royal Irish Constabulary as well as for the Army.4. Since the 31st March, 4,000 shipping tons of spare parts for military mechanical transport have been shipped to Ireland.Small outstanding demands exist for certain makes, which there is difficulty in obtaining in sufficient quantities from the manufacturers. Deliveries are already improving and all outstandings will be satisfied by the end of this month.C. Personnel.5. One of the greatest difficulties in Ireland has been driver and more particularly artificer personnel.(a.) Drivers. In January, 1920, the Army was seriously short of mechanical transport drivers.The deficiency was due to demobilization and. dearth of recmits owing to the high rates earned in civilian life.Some idea of the difficulties will be realized from the following figures.Since January, 1920, various theatres have absorbed 3,448 newly enlisted drivers, of which Ireland has had 1,097. Since March, 1920, 9,449 experienced drivers, whose time had expired, have been demobilized.As regards Ireland the problem is being met (i.) By increasing our training.facilities for output of drivers, (ii.) By the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, enlisting ex-soldiers as drivers on 6 months&apos; engagements.(6.) Artificers. The shortage of artificers in the Army in January, 1920, was even greater than the shortage of drivers.This shortage was due partly to the necessity for demobilizing time-expired personnel 2,252 artificers have been demobilized since March, 1920 and partly to Army rates for artificers being so far below civilian rates that recruiting has been almost at a standstill.At the same time, 400 artificers have been sent to various theatres, of which 116 have gone to Ireland.The shortage of military artificers in Ireland is being made good by the employ ment of civilian artificers, engaged in England, to the number of 415 (at rates which are approximately double Army rates).   Of this number some 180 have already reached Ireland, while the balance will be despatched by,17th December, 1920.   All these artificers pass a test befoie being sent.D. Proteotion for Troops.6. (a.) Steel plates for lorries. 160 sets were asked for by Ireland on the 18th August, 1920.Forty sets have been adapted in Woolwich A rsenal and despatched, and the remaining 120 sets are being sent at the rate of 30 a week and will be completed by the 8 th January.(&amp;.) Protective material proof against revolver bullets for lorries and cars.  The War Office suggested to Ireland the provision of protective material for troops and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in Ireland agreed with this proposal. 66 sets for lorry bodies, 121 sets for lorry canopies, and 20 protective cushions for cars have already been despatched to Ireland. 30 sets a week each for lorry bodies and lorry canopies respectively are being sent, up to a total supply of 500 complete sets and 100 car cushions.The above supply depends upon manufacturers keeping their promises as to delivery.General.7. It must be remembered that the coal strike and industrial disturbance consequent upon the strike has interfered with manufacture, and that during the last six months the requirements in other theatres, and particularly in Mesopotamia, have had to be met.
