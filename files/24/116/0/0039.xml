.l..\The Bulgarian nation is not guilty of ttho decisions taken, during; 1914 and 1915, by the ex-King Ferdinand and his Government, who wore only able to drag tho people into war against the Powers of the Entente by means of false promises and by deceiving the army as to the true reason of the mobilisation..2,. Bulgaria, as soon as it had the means of so doing, severed all the ties binding it to the past; at the present hour it has a firm and stable government that has boon able to strengthen the Bulgarian otate and to re pro sn any signs of anarchy in the country. Since the armistice, Bulgaria had given many proofs of the perfect correction of its attitude and of its loyalty towards the Powers of the Entente.Bulgaria will ebserve the   same loyal attitude in regard tothe obligations it has assumed^     It is ready to give effectiveguarantees of its intention of fulfilling its international ob-ligations and of accepting such regulations as may be prescribed by the League, concerning its military, naval and air forces and armaments ,3. Having obliterated all memories of the past, the Bulgaria of to-day will endeavour to realise a state of perfect friendship with its neighbours $. its policy being definitely ducted, towards that of the Powers of the Entente, the Bulgarian Government Is firmly resolved to give them all its assistance, however slight it may.be, so as.to enable them to restore orderP and tranquillity In all countries aIn view of these considerations, Bulgaria hopes that in regard to its admission to the League, it will not be compared to other defeated nations; but that it will be allowed to prove the sin-eerihty of its intentions i \ contributing by its work to the re-establishment of peace in Europe,.Trusting that in this matter of vital importance for my country, I may rely upon the precious support of Your Excellency, I have the honour of requesting Your Excellency to accept the assurance of my very hJL^h-conniderationGA,i STALBOLUSKI, Prime Minister of Bulgaria.Reply of the SecretaryVGeiioral,Gcneta.,10th November, 1$Your Excellency,I have tho honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of November 4th,&apos; by which you ask that Bulgaria mfty be admitted as a Member of the League of Nations, iI did not fail to communicate copies of that explication to all ^e-mhe-rs of the League of Nations without delay.     It will be      for the Assembly itself to.decide whether it is possible for it to add this question to the list of fVip^se to be dtjalt with&apos;at its present meeting,.     In view of the/&apos;Sate at which the applicationof oulr,aria/
1BAof Bulgaria \v\s received, it has not been possible to placo it on the provisional list of agenda which has already boen sub-mitted to the Members of tho Assembly, but it will be included in a supplementary list.Should the Assembly decide to deal with the matter during its present meeting, it is probable that it :.-.ay desire to hear through a ).-epresentatlve of the Bulgarian Government any furth-er explanations or declarations which that Government may wish to make.    Should this be the case, it will be desirable for such a Representative U be available with the least possible &amp;elay*    I would therefore venture to request Your Excellency to inform me at an early dato who you would desire to designate for this purpose, in order that I may if necessary cominunioate with him without dolay.I have the honour to be,,Your Excellencyfs obedient servant,(Signed) ERIC DRmiLOTD.Secretary-General*His excellency the Prime minister of Bulgaria,2, Whitehall Gardens,6th December, 1920.
