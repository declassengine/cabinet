)CABINETDECONTROL OF BACONMemorandum by the Pood Controller*I am much Impressed by Lord Milner&apos;s Memorandum, and fully appreciate the objections of the Canadian Government to the continuance of control.   I am, therefore, prepared    to modify my original proposals to the Cabinet by substituting February 28th for March 31st, as tho date at which the Ministry of Pood should relinquish its control of the importation of bacon. The Ministry has already contracted to purchase the entire exportable surplus of Canadian bacon made from hogs killed up to the end of this month at prices satisfactory to the producers and the Canadian Government.   Ho one proposes this contract.    Under winter oondi-tions It takes approximately two months for Canadian bacon to be cured and to reach this country.    If, therefore, the Ministry relinquish all control of importation on February 28th the Canadians would be free to ship to this country all bacon made from hogs killed in January onwards,   and no further purchases of Canadian bacon will  be necessary.  Prom the Canadian point of view, February 28th would be just as good a date as January 1st, for removing control, since, as already staled, the whole of their killings up to the end of the year, and therefore, all arrivals up to the end of February, have been purchased by the MinistrytI do not anticipate that there would be any difficulty in arranging with the Danes for the purchase of their bacon for the first two months of next year if they know that importation will be free after February 28th.  As Danish bacon is shipped out almost immediately after it has been cured , it will be necessary to purchase ^he output so long as the Ministry controls importation in order to ensure equal treatment to all foreign producers.It is not anticipated that the total expenditure involved will exceed  5,000,000, of which  2,000,000, will be assigned to Denmark, and the bulk of the rest to hams.  The Ministry has. the necessary money in hand.The result of the whole of the Ministry of Food^s trans-actions in bacon will show, In any event, no loss, having regard to the reserves accumulated against losses on liquidation.   But immediate decontrol would mean an unnecessary loss on present stocks   of about  750,000, which might easily be saved, if purchases were not wholly discontinued during the next &quot;two months.CHARLBS A. McCURDY*9./12/2Q.
