344Sir Robert MoAlplne &amp; Son3,Railways, Docks and Public Works Contractors,50, Pall Mall, London, S ,1/1,1, 7th December,1920.PRIVATE &amp; confidential ?J&amp;LCONTRACT        HEAD OFFICE. SUBJECT LABOUR,The Right Hon.Dr, Addison, M.B.,Minister of Health,\ XiJl* i-MlALIi f   S , V? , 1 *Dear Sir,As a result of our meeting on the 2nd inst. we have come&apos;several definite conclusions, t/hich we would now put before you.We believe the present deadlock is largely occasioned by the fact that the Government are dealing with the Trade Unions direct and apart from the Employers,     It is obvious that the Government cannot enforce agreed conditions unless through the Employers while the Trade Unions can insist upon their agreements with the Government being made operative with the Employers.     This has been made clear to us in following up the employment of other tl skilled mechanics..      Agreements exist for employing these in two forms (1) Apprentices (2) Trained disabled Soldiers, but without provision for training ex Soldiers who were not disabled, and with this addition those conditions properly carried out would have magnificent results.    The results, up to the present, have been negligible   which in our opinion is due to the fact that the&apos;two interested parties, Employer and Government, are working separately Without the Employer the Government has no power to enforce its 1 agreements *
345As an instance we would cite the Training..Scheme.     Underthis Scheme hundreds of men have &quot;been trained and are not permitted to work;    .We append instances known to us and which without doubt.by application to the Ministry of Labour you can prove for yourself.clearly shew you the difficulties Trainees are up against:-g,E.Wallis of Maidstone, Bricklayers refused to permit one Trainee to start.Central London Building Go. St. Johnfs Wood Rd. have one Trainee, who is objectyd to by Tradesmen.McEanus Housing Scheme. Hammersmith, only one Trainee who is objected to.100 Trainees at Birmingham cannot be placed due to boycott by Tradesmen,And we would suggest that you have figures put before you as to the total quantity of Trainees and how many of them aro at work, and also the quantity of Apprentices employed, at present.It is beyond discussion that very great benefits would result in,connection with the building of workmens dwellings by the addition of a considerable number of un-employed ex-soldiers working in conjuncture with skilled tradesmenc      Whether these men were apprentices or trainees, it is certain that in a very short period of time they would bo doing really useful work.     On the other hand any attempt to place these ex-soldiers either as trainees or apprentices on House building in large numbers, /without a com-bination of skilled tradesmen, would in our opinion, most certainly result in failure.At the present, time Trade Unions Rules vary considerably in regard to the number of trainees or apprentices allowed, in fact the basis varies from 7 to 1, to 3 to 1, and the proportion we would recommend would be 4 to 1, which is the proportion allowed in the Manchester Area and ue would suggest in negotiating with the Trades Unions that this basis of 4 to 1 be laid down as the minimum.    As a matter of fact, in the Stafford Area the Unions have agreed to the extent of 3 to 1.      At the present time trainees and apprentices
346even to the extent of 8 to 1 are not employed.If the rules which at present restrict the age limit were relaxed to allow the employment of ox-soldiers, and employers were made to employ their full quota, the gain would he a tremendous advance in the present position,  ^^^carried^no^ further^ than^the present -allowance of apprentices *     On this point we do not see how the Unions could face the Public if they refused to agree * If this principle could be extended with the good will cf the Unions to the extent of accepting ex-soldiers to 1 in four, then we think the maximum Yfould have been attained oWe would here point out that the allowance of apprentices is restricted to a maximum of eight apprentices employed by any one employer on any one contract and although this is not insisted on, it vfould be wise to have this altered, as under present con-ditions when so many Builders are dealing with much larger Contracts than in normal times, this restriction would probably be nis.de operative to prevent the influx Into the trade that is now desired to be brought about.    We also believe that this abnormal position is the cause of the unusually small proportion of apprentices at present employed as the employers are not prepared to indenture apprentices and make themselves liable for their employment for several years when they have no safeguard against the liability thus created should they find themselves unable to find remunerative employment for these apprentices.We calculate that with- the 1 to 4 there could be found immediate employment for 40^00 ex-soldiers amongst the trades and that the additional labourers- and unskilled workers who could thus be employed through this addition to the trades employment would bo made for over 80s,000, a total of 120.000, that is taking the application of the 1 - 4 to all building Trades.     If this was restricted te House Building only,, the figures would be reduced by 2/3 on the present position,,
347BONUS ON OUTPUT......*  We believe that if bonus on output could be paid that the workmen could be readily got to work for the increased.wages to the extent of increasing the output from 50 to 50$.    The effect of this would be to enable unskilled workers to be immediately employed to probably the extent of 50,000 men directly on building works apart from the indirect effect on all building supplies, haulage etc., giving increased employment.    We do not think it would be easy, or in fact possible, to make the Unions agree to this, nop do we think it would be advisable to push this matter to the point of insistence Which would mean a strike.    The effect of a strike on this point would be serious as undoubtedly the men would take it as an attempt to break their Union and would fight in a determined and bitter spirit and probably have the moral support at least of all Trade Unions.     If this strike was confined to House Building the chance of a successful issue would be very poor, as the tradesmen would be nearly all absorbed by other building work and the Union would carry the balance for an Indefinite time.To have any chance of success it would require the co^ operation of the Mastor Builders and others  might be difficulty In securing this and even preventing a considerable break away of disloyal members which would Imperil the success of the whole affair.For the foregoing reasons we&apos; would not advise the pressing of this dido of the question to the breaking point in spite of the obvious gains of a complete victory.     The position is wholly different with the question of direct employment of ex-soldiers and wo aro convinced that this could be pressed and in the event of   non-compliance by the Unions, could be supportod by the Masters and brought to a successful issue.Yours faithfully, SIR ROBERT MO ALPINE &amp; SONS,
