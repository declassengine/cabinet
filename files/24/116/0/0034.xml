PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The industrial situation at the close of the week under review, in so far as disputes actually in progress are concerned, is almost as quiet as last week. Two factors, however, taken together, make the outlook for the immediate future uncertain. Firstly, the sharp increase during October in the cost of living, due mainly to the increase in the price of bread and flour on the 17th October, which has now been reflected in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number, may lead to- a series of demands over the whole country for some compensating increase in wages. Secondly, the general state of trade is such that employers are likely to resist to the uttermost any further wages concessions. It is not so much, perhaps, that marked depression is already a feature of the situation in many industries, but rather that pessimism is generally prevalent with regard to the prospect of an early removal of the causes to which the general commercial stagnation is attributed.There is already evidence that these factors may result in immediate trouble in two broad groups of cases. Firstly, in certain industries which have adopted a sliding scale, by which wages vary according to the cost of living, the question of suspending the sliding scale agreement is already being raised. Secondly, the prospect of a peaceful solution&apos; to wages negotiations which have been proceeding, amicably, in some cases, for months is made more doubtful. Particular reference may be made to the engineering and ship-building industries and the tramway industry.The immediate results of the coal strike are still patent in some industries, and, in estimating the further developments of the industrial situation, what may be described as the more permanent effects of the strike, in reducing stocks of coal, and in affecting foreign commerce, must not be overlooked.The special Congress under the auspices of the International Federation of Trade Unions concluded on the 27th November, and an account of the more prominent features of the proceedings appears below. This Congress has been followed by an International Congress of Eailwaymen, which has been notable for a somewhat alarmist speech by Mr. J. H. Thomas, the importance of which should not be over-estimated. The Labour Joint Commission of Inquiry into situation in Ireland arrived in Dublin on the 30th November.The Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill received its third reading and passed in the House of Commons on the 26th November. Accounts of the more important amendments made during its progress through the House of Commons are given in the Appendix to this Report. The Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill was read a third time and passed in the same House on the 30th inst. Important changes were made on the Report stage, an account of which is given below on page 629.FEATURES OF THE WEKK.General Topics.Sliding Scale Wage, Agreements and Increased Cost of Living. The Textile Mercury for the 27th November contains a leading article headed &quot; An Absurdity,&quot; criticising the sliding scale agreement in the woollen and worsted industries, under which, &quot; for every ten points advance&quot; in the Labour Gazette cost-ofdiving index number, &quot;the &apos; cost of living&apos; wages of the operatives, which are separate from the basic wages, are raised ten per cent.&quot; It is stated that under this agreement, as a result of the recent increases in the cost of living, the operatives are now
entitled to an advance of 20 per cent., and it is argued that, although the agreement is valid, &quot; it has led to an absurdity, for its strict observance means that at a time when work available is so limited as to make short-time working necessary, new orders are lacking, and the future is very uncertain, the operatives are entitled to more pay.&quot; The article concludes with the statement that if a further advance is granted* it is likely to lead to an even wider extension of short-time, in consequence of the increase in the cost of &quot;production. The position in this country is compared with that in the United States, where, it is alleged, &quot; textile workers are voluntarily relinquishing percentages of wages in order to encourage actual employment and secure the retention of a real wage.&quot;In this connection it is interesting to note that the Waste Section of the British Wool Federation are reported to be contemplating resignation from that body, with a view to coming under Trade Board Orders, thus evading the sliding scale agreement to which the Federation are pledged : while the employers in the silk and dyeing trades at Macclesfield have notified their employees that they cannot continue the sliding scale agreement under which advances in wages are given to meet increases in the cost of living.Relief of Unemployment (London). The unemployment position is still regarded as very serious, and the Government has been severely criticised with regard to the Unemploy-ment (Relief Works) Bill. At a meeting of the London County Council on the 23rd November, a report dealing with the Bill was presented by the Special Committee on Unemployment.! They maintained that the Bill failed completely to achieve its object, and that unless it was altered radically, it would render nugatory the Council&apos;s efforts to provide work for the unemployed. It was decided that a deputation should he sent to the Prime Minister, and that the whole matter should be laid before him.Accordingly, on the morning of the 24th, the Prime Minister, with other representa-tives of the Government, received a deputation consisting of Sir Cyril Jackson, chairman of the Special Committee, Messrs. J. W. Gilbert, H. Gosling, L. Hayden Guest, and others. Mr. J. W. Gilbert stated that in the opinion of the Council the pledge given on behalf of the Government, more than a month ago, had not been fulfilled, inasmuch as the Bill did not give them effective powers to begin at once upon work in connection with arterial roads. Sir Cyril Jackson argued that the powers given by the Bill would not enable the Council to enter upon land required for arterial roads until at least 28 days after the passing of the Bill. He emphasised his opinion that the making of arterial roads would not relieve to any great extent the problem of unemployment in London, and he asked for assistance to put into operation certain drainage and development schemes. Dr. Scott Lidgett supported Sir Cyril Jackson, and pointed out that the road scheme would have very little effect in such centres as Bermondsey, Whitechapel, or Stepney. Mr. Harry Gosling also drew attention to the fact that the main roads in London, quite apart from the arterial roads, were in an exceptionally had condition, and suggested that extensive schemes of repair should be put into operation. He maintained that as the expenses entailed by such schemes of repair would be too heavy for the poorer boroughs, some assistance from the Government would be necessary.The Prime Minister in reply gave an account of all that had been done for the relief of unemployment and to meet the needs of ex-Service men, and declared that never before had any Government done so much, even when unemployment had been worse than it was now. He emphasised the need of a spirit of co-operation between the great local authorities and the central government. Inquiry should be made into the question of granting more stringent powers for the immediate entry upon land.JWomen, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill-Following upon the report of the Home Office Departmental Committee upon the employment of women and young persons on the system of two day-shifts, the Report stage of this Bill was commenced in the House of Commons on the 26th November. The recommendations of the Departmental Committee had been embodied in a proposed new clause, which was put on the order paper by Mr. Seddon, and the second reading of which was moved by Captain Bowyer. Protests had been made against the clause by the Standing Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Organisations, attached to the Labour Party, and by some trade unions, especially those organising workers in the cotton textile industry.   The English section of the* See p. 638 below.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 505.j For the amendments made in Committee to the Unemployment (Relief Works Bill), see p. 650 below.(B 16697)4L 2
* The authentic text of this Convention was given in the Lcibour Gazette of November, p. 602.International Association for Labour Legislation had also protested against the insertion of this clause, on the ground that such a provision should not be inserted in the Bill, the sole purpose of which should be to put into force the series of Draft Conventions adopted by the General Conference of the international Labour Organisation under the Treaties of Peace, and that the provisions of the clause involved a retrogression from our pre-war factory legislation, and, therefore, were inconsistent with the spirit of the Washington Conventions. In the debate, however, very little notice was taken of the objections of this body. The discussion turned upon the rights and wrongs of the two-shift system itself, and a noticeable feature was the hostility to the clause of many members representing Lancashire and Yorkshire constituencies.The proposed new clause was read a second time, after a division, and added to the Bill on the 29th. The Bill was re-committed to a Committee of the whole House in respect of the new clause, in order that restrictive amendments, to meet the detailed objections to the clause, might be properly discussed. By these proposed amendments the powers of the Secretary of State to make Orders under the clause would be expressly restricted to those cases in which a joint application by the employers and workpeople immediately concerned was made for a special order permitting the two day-shift system; with the further proviso that, on a joint representation being made by organisations representing a majority of employers and workers in an industry against the issue of a special Order, the powers of the Secretary of State under the section should cease to be exercisable as regards that industry.The clause was therefore discussed in Committee on the 30th November, and the pro-posed amendments were made. In the course of the proceedings, amendments yet more restrictive were defeated. It may be noted that the function which the Joint Industrial Councils might perform in the administration of the clause was not overlooked. The Bill was again reported, and passed, its third reading with little further discussionImportant additions to the Bill have passed almost unnoticed in the controversy upon the two day-shift system. The Draft Convention fixing the minimum age for the admission of children to employment on sea,* adopted at Genoa on the 9th July by the second session of the General Conference of the International Labour Organisation, has been added to the three Washington Conventions set out in the schedule to the Bill, and the preamble and operative clauses have been amended, so as to give legislative ratification to this Convention as well as to the three Washington Conventions.Christmas Holidays, 1920. Efforts are being made by the Early Closing Association to secure as long a holiday as possible for the wholesale and retail dry goods trades. The City wholesale textile trade have already agreed to close from the afternoon of the 24th December, to the morning of the 29th. A large number of the Association^ suburban subscribers have stated that their assistants will be allowed the 28th December as a holiday. Communications from a number of provincial towns have also been received by the Association, stating that shops will be closed until the morning of the 29th December.Industrial and Other Organisations.National Federation of Law Clerks. The Council of the Federation, at a meeting held on the 27th November, decided to organise their country membership into branches and to set up machinery for striking. It was also decided to press for the formation of a national &quot; Whitley &quot; Council for the profession.At a national conference of law clerks held on the 18th November, it was agreed that application should be made to the Ministry of Labour for a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act to ascertain what wages solicitors throughout the country could afford to pay.Trade Union Topics.Amalgamated Engineering Union. A ballot has been taken among the West Midland branches of this union on the question of a general reduction of working hours to 35 per week in order to reduce the numbers unemployed. The result showed a majority of 1,700 against the reduction.
National Union of Scottish Mine Workers. Attention was drawn last week to the resentment aroused by the coal settlement among certain sections of the Welsh miners. Similar views are now reported from Scotland. Extremists in the Lanarkshire coalfield, particularly in the Blantyre area, are urging the abolition of the county unions, and the setting up of a national union for Scotland, which is to be run, apparently, on soviet lines, as well as the institution of a 5-day working week for miners throughout the whole of Scotland.National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives. It is announced in the November report of this union that, owing to a difference of opinion in the executive, as to the policy of the union in drawing up the new terms of settlement, a ballot will be taken on the following questions : &quot; (1) Are you in favour of the present system of allowing both piece-work and day-work methods, regulated by quantity statements, to continue under our agreements with the employers, with no limit of output or wages ; or (2) Are you in favour of a day-vvork system of working with quantity statements, with a limited output and wages ? &quot;Mr. T. F. Richards, general president of the union, is in favour of the first proposal and strongly recommends &quot; members in their own interests to stand by the policy which has stood them in good stead for the last quarter of a century.&quot;Ex-Service Men.Unemployment in Birmingham. The Birmingham branch of the National Union of Ex-Service Men have been organising marches of unemployed to factory neighbourhoods, for the purpose of holding meetings on the same lines as at Coventry. It is stated that the attendances dwindled after the first few processions, and that these demonstra-tions have now been abandoned.International Relations of Labour.International Federation of Trade Unions. The special Congress* of this body continued their meetings on the 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26tli and 27th November.The agenda comprised the following subjects : The general policy of the International Federation of Trade Unions; the distribution of raw materials; the rate of exchange problem; nationalisation of the means of production and distribution; the attacks of the Moscow International; and the- situation in the Ruhr district. The subjects under discussion were so large, and the divergencies of opinion so great, that details of the resolutions are of minor importance. Those portions of the resolutions which referred to objectives had been so drawn up as to embrace all points of view, and it was only on the question of methods that differences of opinion arose. The question of co-operation with the International Labour Office for the attainment of the objectives outlined was raised on every resolution by the &quot; Left &quot; elements, notably Norway and Italy. The delegates from these two countries objected to any collaboration with this body or with the League of Nations, on the ground that they were &quot; bourgeois organisations &quot; ; and. on the fifth day of the conference the Italian delegates put forward a proposal, for setting up a &quot; Council of Action to work as a Provisional International Soviet of Trade Unions, and in agreement with the Executive Committee of the Third International.&quot;The debate on the general policy of the Federation was directed upon three resolu-tions which were moved by E. Fimmen (Holland), secretary of the Federation. The first resolution protested against military or commercial war with Russia, approved the use of the general strike and international boycott, and thanked &quot; those workers who have faithfully carried out their international obligations in the struggle against the White Terror in Hungary by stopping the transport of munitions to the Counter-Eevolutionary Armies.&quot; The second resolution dealt with the failure of certain Governments to ratify the Washington Convention for an 8-hour day and a 48-hour week, and threatened to withdraw all trade union support from the International Labour Office if ratification is not effected in all countries within the period stipulated. After some discussion the resolution was carried; Canada, Norway, Italy, and Luxemburg voting against it and the French delegation abstaining. The third resolution dealt with pacificism, and was carried unanimously. It was a somewhat colourless proposal, condemning belligerent measures of any kind, and for any purpose.
The resolution on the distribution of raw materials instructed the secretariat to draft a scheme for setting up an interntional centre for this purpose, and to submit this s cheme to the International Labour Office for immediate execution. The resolution also advocated the admission of all countries into the League of Nations, and pressure by individual trade union organisations on their Governments with a view to the nationalisation of the means of production and distribution of raw material. The resolution was carried, but Italy, Norway and Canada voted against it.The resolution on the rate of exchange problem recommended the &quot; universal and mutual&quot; cancellation of international war debts, and the notation of an international loan by the League of Nations, as well as the restriction of note issues, limitations of armaments, a levy on capital, &amp;c. It is interesting to note that it was specifically stated in the debate on this resolution, as a result of the speeches of the British and Belgian delegates, that &quot;war debts&quot; did not include war indemnities. After considerable discussion, the resolution was first taken without the paragraph on war debts, and was carried against the opposition of Norway, Italy and Canada. The paragraph on war debts was passed separately, Belgium and Canada voting against, and Great Britain abstaining. The entire debate appears to have been pervaded by an atmosphere of unreality, and the only fact of importance which emerged was the Italian refusal to collaborate in any measures to repair the present financial system.The resolution on the nationalisation of the means of production and distribution, which was carried unanimously, followed the usual lines, emphasising the principle of control by workers and consumers, and directing the Bureau of the Federation to &quot; open negotiations with the international trade secretariats of miners, seafarers and other transport workers for the purposes of using every available means to attain the object in view as soon as possible.&quot;The attitude of Moscow to the Congress overshadowed the entire proceedings. This was due largely to unspoken comparisons between the somewhat feeble endeavours of the Congress to find means to enforce their decisions, and the actual power of the Moscow Trade Unions International backed by their Government. The Commission entrusted with the duty of drafting a suitable reply appear to have been sharply divided, as the Italian delegates acknowledged that they had already entered into an agreement with Moscow. The resolution eventually proposed by the Commission, maintained that the Soviet Government&apos;s attacks did not come from the real Russian proletariat, declared that the Federation^ own efforts were directed towards the abolition of capitalist exploita-tion, while taking into account the customs and traditions of every country, and appealed to the workers of Russia to join the Federation.The voting showed a large majority in favour of the resolution, Norway alone voting against it, while Italy abstained. An additional paragraph, maintaining that &quot; to govern a country, and to claim to direct the Workers&apos; International, are two things different and irreconcilable &quot; was proposed by the French delegation and carried without discussion, Czechoslovakia abstaining, and Norway voting against.The report of the Committee appointed by the Federation Secretariat at Amsterdam on the 23rd October, to conduct an inquiry into the situation in the Ruhr district, was presented to the Congress, together with a proposed resolution on the subject. The resolution strongly condemned any Allied occupation of the Ruhr and declared that &quot; the organised workers are prepared to use all and every means to oppose such measures and to prevent a dictatorship over the workers in the Ruhr district.&quot; It also maintained that the German miners have faithfully fulfilled the Spa Agreement, and demanded the carrying out of&quot; those counter-promises made to the miners.&quot; The debate on this question was chiefly remarkable for a long speech by Carl Legien (Germany) explaining the position of German workers with regard to the Peace Treaty. He maintained that the physical deterioration of the German workers was proceeding very rapidly, that, if this continued, the Peace Treaty could not be fulfilled, and that the &quot; down-trodden workers &quot; would demand any change, even Bolshevism. He also deplored the refusal by the French Government of the offer made by the German building trade unions to supply both men and material for the reconstruction of the devastated areas. Mr. J. H. Thomas made a sympathetic reply, advising the German delegates to persuade their French colleagues of the desirability of checking France&apos;s Imperialist policy, which was alone responsible for the present interpretation of the Peace Treaty.   The resolution was carried unanimously.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (Various Areas). In the Yorkshire area and the Liverpool district claims by operatives for wages increases have been countered by proposals for a reduction of wages and an increase in working hours.* , In the former case, the represen-tatives of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives have put forward an application for an advance in wages of Qd. per hour on the present rates. The employers&apos; association have retaliated with a counter claim that craftsmen&apos;s wages should be reduced by id. per hour, and that the labourers&apos; wages should be 25 per cent, lower than the craftsmen. They contend that the present difference of 3d. per hour between the rates payable to mechanics and labourers does not represent a fair margin compared with the difference of 3d. per hour when the rates were, for instance, Sd. and 5d. per hour, respectively. They also propose that the working hours shall be 49j per week daring the summer months, 44 per week during November and February, and 41 \ per week in December and January.In the latter case, the Liverpool, Birkenhead and Wirral Districts Building and Allied Trades Employers&apos; Association have proposed : &quot; (1) That the wages for all branches of the building trade for skilled labour shall be reduced by id. per hour, and that the labourers&apos; wages be reduced by Qd. per hour. &quot; (2) That the joiners&apos; tool allowances be abolished.&quot; (3) That the hours of work as and from the 1st May, 1921, shall be as follows: for the eight summer months, 1st March to 31st October, 46  hours per week ; for November and February, 44 hours per week; for December and January, with hours per week.&quot; (4) That immediately any society or societies, parties to an agreement with this association, make rules cutting across rules already agreed upon between this association and the operatives&apos; societies, the wages of that branch trade or trades shall be immediately reduced 2d. per hour until such rules are withdrawn.&quot;Pattern Makers (Clyde). On the 8th November, a claim was submitted to the North-West Engineering Trades Employers&apos; Association, on behalf of the pattern makers employed in the engineering shops in the Clyde district, that the present minimum should be increased to 2s, %d. an hour, to include all war wages and bonuses, and become a consolidated rate, operative as from the 24th November. The employers have replied that they cannot consider the application. They have further refused to hold any conferences with the United Pattern Makers&apos; Association while the negotiations are in progress on the national claim for a general advance in wages to the engineering trades. At a mass meeting of the men, this reply was deemed unsatisfactory, and the District Committee of the association were instructed to urge the employers to grant a conference within 14 days for the purpose of reaching a settlement. It is understood that the officials of the union contemplate taking a ballot vote of the members of, the Clyde district on the question of a strike policy.   Over 2,000 men are involved.Electrical Workers: London County Council Tramways. In connection with this dispute, on the 25th November, the Metropolitan Municipal Tramways Council, of which the London County Council is a member, received a deputation from the Electrical Trades Union, accompanied by representatives of the United Vehicle Workers. The Council are understood to have made an offer of Is. \ti\d. an hour to the grades concerned, central repairers and light and power attendants. This offer is believed to be considered unsatis-factory by the Electrical Trades Union. A joint meeting of the United Vehicle Workers and the Electrical Trades Union is to be held as soon as possible to consider the position. The Electrical Trades Union are obviously reluctant to take independent action, and are anxious to assure themselves of the support of the United Vehicle Workers, who would be seriously affected by a strike. So much is this the case that the national executives of the two unions have appointed a sub-committee to draft a working agreement for the governance of&quot; working conditions and rates of pay for all grades of electrical repair and maintenance work on tramway undertakings. The first meeting of this committee will take place during the week,* It will be recalled that a Special General Meeting of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers on the 3rd November unanimously approved of the following suggestions referred to them for consideration by the Arbitration Committee, and requested the latter to formulate a scheme to ,give effect to such as they may consider practicable : (1) That the present small margin between craftsmen&apos;s and labourers&apos; rates should be considered at an early date with a view to taking necessary action towards obtaining an alteration in the labourers&apos; rate; and (2)&apos;that a definite policy be decided upon, with a view to securing national action on the question of payment by results and the removal of the present restrictions on employment imposed by certain craft unions. It was announced that the notice to determine the 44-hour agreement had been sent to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives on the 30th October..
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Dyers (Macclesfield). It is reported that the master dyers at Macclesfield are contem-plating a refusal to concede the latest wages advance due under the cost-of-living sliding scale, and are requesting the abolition of the sliding scale.Silk Operatives (Macclesfield). It is understood that the employers in the silk industry at Macclesfield are also approaching their employees on similar lines to those adopted by the master dyers.Tramwaymen (Lancashire and Cheshire). There is evidence of considerable discontent in Lancashire and Cheshire over the delay of the National Joint Council for the Tramways Industry in dealing with the national claim for an advance of 12s. a week. It will be remembered that at a special meeting of the Council held on the 17th November, it was decided that both sides should report the proceedings to their constituents with a view to obtaining their advice on the question of referring the claim to arbitration. The Council are to meet again on the 7th December to receive reports from both sides.A mass meeting of Manchester tramway workers, however, was held at Manchester on the 21st November to protest against the delay of the Council in coming to a decision on their claim. It was decided to revert to the original claim for an advance of  1 a week, and a deputation was appointed to negotiate with the Manchester Tramways Committee on this basis. At Bolton tramwaymen have also made a special local demand for an advance of 4s. a week, supplementary to the national claim. Tramwaymen throughout the Lancashire and Cheshire areas who are members of the United Vehicle Workers are also demanding permission to ballot on a strike to enforce the national claim.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Shipyard Joiners (National).-rOn the 9th April the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federa-tion granted to shipyard joiners a special advance of 12s. a week which was in addition to and independent of the general advances given under the awards of the Industrial Court and its predecessors to all sections of the engineering and shipbuilding industries. Until that date, the shipyard joiners only shared equally with the other shipbuilding trades the general advances conceded to the industry. The bonus was given in reply to an application made on behalf of the men on the 27th November, 1919, for an advance of %d. an hour to raise their standard of living, to meet the increased cost of living, and especially to compensate for the increased cost of tools. It was granted by the employers to counteract the attraction of these men from the shipyards and ship-repairing establishments to the building trade, where higher rates were paid for similar work, and was understood to be &quot; in full settlement of all existing demands.&quot; The joiners, however, have regarded the advance as being in the nature of &quot; tool money.&quot;On the 3rd September, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation gave notice to termin-ate this special advance as from the 4th December, &quot; in the interests of the industry and of all employed in it.&quot; The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners are at present parties to the demand of the engineering and shipbuilding trades for an advance of 6d. an hour, which is still under consideration, and the notice to terminate the payment of the 12s. bonus may have been given as a move in the negotiations which are now proceeding on this demand. The members of the Amalgamated Society, however, have given formal notice of their intention to stop work if and when the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; ^ Federation enforce the reduction. The notices of the men on the Clyde and on the North East Coast expired on the 30th November. It is expected, that the strike will be national and involve 20,000 men by the 4th December.The Emergency Committee of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives met in London, on the 30th November, to consider the position, and conferred with the executive of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners on the 1st December.It is reported that the joiners freely state that they will transfer their men to the build-ing industry. It is understood, however, that there is a combined move on the part of building contractors and other possible employers in various areas to checkmate this intention. For instance, the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers) have come to an understanding whereby members of the latter organisation will not employ joiners withdrawn from the shipyards.
635412.20.Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Seamen (Bristol). A demarcation dispute has arisen at Avonmouth Dock between members of the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union. It appears that a local arrangement was made between these unions some time ago, by which members of the latter might act as &quot; riggers &quot; or &quot; standby crew &quot; to a ship in port that has been paid off, and also act as &quot; runners,&quot; or men who work ships from port to port in the United Kingdom, between the paying-off of the articled crew and the signing on of men for a fresh voyage. Members of the former union contend that this was only a temporary arrangement, and in view of the large numbers of seamen at present unemployed at Bristol, Cardiff and other ports, demand that action should be taken on national lines to secure its rescission. In consequence of the dispute, deep-sea ships are held up at Bristol.At a meeting on the 28th November, members of the Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union at Bristol appointed delegates to call upon the national executive of the union to support them in their attitude. Mr. Robert Williams, as secretary of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, however, has emphatically protested against this inter-union dispute, and stated that the Executive Council of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation have had this problem of demarcation under review practically since the signing of the armistice. On the 30th November, however, the Bristol and Avonmouth seamen rejected a resolution that they should sign on deep-sea vessels pending negotiations between the two unions. They reaffirmed their determination not to sign on until the grievance was removed, and called upon seamen at other Bristol Channel ports to join in the strike.Commercial Road Transport Workers (Bristol, Bath). A mass meeting of commercial road transport workers at Bristol, on the 21st November, rejected the offer of the Bristol Road Transport Association and of the local cartowners&apos; association to go to arbitration, but agreed to accept the offer of those firms conceding an advance of 10s. or over to all sections. A strike took place on the 22nd November of the employees of all the firms who have not met the union&apos;s demand. Negotiations continue, the Dock, Wharf, River-side and General Workers&apos; Union acting on behalf of the men, and it is estimated that as a result of individual settlements, 2,700 out of the total of 4,000 members of the section of the union involved are now working.A number of commercial road transport workers are also on strike at Bath for a similar advance.Settlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (National). A meeting took place on the 25th November of the committee representing the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The question of output was considered, and the following resolution was passed: &quot; To ask the district committees to forward each with the least possible delay to the National Committee statistical information as to the aggregate output of the collieries in their respective areas each calendar week (i.e., from Monday to Saturday), in order to keep that Committee informed as to movement of output; such information to be accompanied by a.report indicating whether or not in their opinion the output is satisfactory, or if not what they consider to be the cause. Such statistical information should set out the weekly output per annum: (a) for getters and fillers; (b) total number of persons employed underground; and (c) total number of persons both under-ground and on the surface of the mine.&quot;Maintenance Engineers (Manchester). A meeting of engineers employed on mainten-ance work in the Manchester area was held at Rusholme on the 22nd November to consider the decision of the Central Conference at York on the 12th November on their demand for a wages increase of 9d. an hour. It will be remembered that at a meeting on the 10th October, the maintenance workers decided, pending the result of the York conference, to lift the embargo on overtime which had been unofficially imposed when the original application was refused.* The meeting on the 22nd November decided to leave the whole question in the hands of a committee consisting of representatives of maintenance workers and shop stewards throughout the district. Until a plan has been formulated by this committee, the present situation will remain unaltered.[Other disputes^iegotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 636 to 640.](b 16697)
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Engineers and Shipbuilders (Bristol Channel Ports). The Industrial Court held that the advances in basic rates provided by agreements between the engineers&apos; and shipbuilders&apos; association and the trade unions concerned, were as favourable as those provided by Awards No. 180 and No. 181 of the Court, and that the claim for the extension of these decisions to the men concerned was not established. The case of a few members of the Electrical Trades Union, whose rates had not been similarly adjusted by local agreement, was referred to a conference between the parties.   (Award No. 541.)Railway Electrical Shopmen (London). An inclusive rate of 2s. 3jd. per hour was granted by the Industrial Court to electrical shopmen, engaged on the installation of new plant and other work ordinarily done by electrical contractors, with a corresponding rate for mates.  (Award No. 542.)BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building Trade Rates on Housing Schemes (Eastern Counties). Sir David Shackleton received a deputation, on the 23rd November from the Eastern Counties District Council of the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, in connection with the new Eastern Counties area scheme, which lays down rates of wages for the several towns in the Eastern Counties, agreed between the employers and the operatives. In most of the principal towns the employers are federated, and the rates are being generally observed. In some towns, however, the most important being Bury St. Edmunds and Thetford, the local master builders&apos; associations are not party to the scheme, and refuse to put the rates into operation.At Bury St. Edmunds a claim for the payment of these rates led to an unsuccessful strike. The operatives are now working at rates fixed by the local employers&apos; association for that town, under the area scheme. A housing scheme is now in-progress. The con-tractor is an outside man, federated in his own district, and it is stated that he wishes to pay the scheme rates, at any rate to skilled men, of whom he has not a sufficient number. He is bound under his contract to pay at Bury neither more nor less than the standard rate for the district.The operatives contend that the district to be considered in applying the Fair Wages Resolution is the Eastern Counties area as a whole, or one of the sub-divisions laid down under the area scheme, and that the scheme rates should apply to Bury on the ground that the majority of the operatives in the area as a whole, or in the sub-division in which Bury is placed under the scheme, are receiving the scheme rates.It was pointed out to the deputation that they were asking for an interpretation of the Fair Wages Resolution of which its terms do not admit, and that, if they desired their interpretation to hold, they should take the proper steps to get the wording amended.The deputation claimed, alternatively, that an investigation would show that a majority of the building trade operatives in Bury St. Edmunds were receiving rates not lower than the area scheme rates, and that consequently the housing contractor should be permitted to pay those rates. Several inquiries have already been made, which do not support the operatives&apos; claim,, but the deputation were informed that another investigation would be made.Demarcation Dispute: Plumbers and Heating Engineers. The negotiations for a settlement of the demarcation questions between plumbers and heating engineers which are constantly arising^ have advanced another stage. Two conferences have already taken place between the plumbers&apos; and the heating engineers&apos; unions at Manchester, under the chairmanship of an officer of the department, primarily in connection with a demarcation
6374.12.2(3.dispute connected with two housing schemes of the Manchester Corporation. No settlement resulted.Sir David Shackleton accordingly held a further meeting with the Executive Council of the United Operative Plumbers and Domestic Engineers&apos; Association, at Montagu House. They expressed very decided views against referring the question to arbitration. It was then proposed that the department should call a further conference of the executive councils of both unions, to consider the possibility of settling the dispute in connection with the Manchester housing schemes, the Manchester branch of the plumbers&apos; union to accept any settlement drawn up between the5two executive councils; the advisability of an amalgamation of the two unions in order to prevent the recurrence of demarcation disputes; or, failing this, the setting up of some machinery by means of which demarcation disputes could be settled by agreement between the two unions. Both unions have accepted this proposal, and the department are arranging for a conference at York, on the 1st December, under the chairmanship of an officer of the department.Overtime : Penistone Housing Scheme. In connection with a complaint that building trade operatives from Barnsley were being attracted to Penistone by special inducements, an investigation was made. It was found that the workmen engaged on the Penistone housing scheme were paid Grade A rates undet the Yorkshire area scheme, namely, 2s. &amp;d. and 2s. Id. per hour for tradesmen and labourers, respectively; that both classes received a subsistence allowance of 12s. per week; and that they were working 53 hours per week, all time worked in excess of 44 hours being paid for at time-and-a-half. It was also proposed to commence working overtime on Saturday afternoon up to 4 p.m. It appeared that overtime was commenced on this work about May, but the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives intervened. Soon afterwards the contractors applied to the Sheffield Master Builders&apos; Association for permission to resume overtime, but their application was refused. About ten weeks ago the contractors decided to take independent action; overtime has been worked on the scheme, and is still in operation.While it is probable that the operatives&apos; federation are not aware that the men are working overtime, the local secretary of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society expresses the view that it is unfair that the bricklayer employed in engineering and other establishments should have, in effect, a guaranteed 47-hour week, and, in some cases, as much overtime as he desires, while the^bricklayer employed on housing is compelled by the union to work 44 hours only, with no overtime. The building site is not far from the engineering establishment of Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., and it is very probable that this argument has influenced men working on the scheme. The scheme was commenced by Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., and about a year ago was taken over by the Urban District Council.   The contractors are Messrs. Laing &amp; Sons, Carlisle.The question of the payment of subsistence allowance on this scheme has been referred to the Ministry of Health for their observations.QUARRYING.Clay-The Disputes Committee of the Interim Industrial Keconstruction Committee met on the 18th November to consider an application for the extension of the agreement of the 15th September, concerning overtime rates, to kilnmen, boilermen and shift-workers. No decision was reached, and the committee will meet again on the 10th December to discuss the question.GLASS.Glass Workers (Liverpool)-In connection with this strike and lock-out the merchants&apos; association remained firm in their determination not to grant any further advance to the union, with the result that the men resumed work on the 27th November on the old terms for three days, in order that wages might be considered during that period. This qualifying clause appears, however, to have been inserted to save the faces of the union officials, as the men have continued at work and there has been no consideration of wages.Employment of Women. Sir John Baird, Under Secretary for Home Affairs, met the chairman, vice-chairman and the secretary of the Joint Industrial Council for the Glass Industry on the 25th November, to discuss the position in the industry as affected by the Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill. He intimated that the Government had accepted the recommendations of the Inskip Report, and had drafted amendments to the Bill on these lines. He stated that it would not be possible to suspend the operation of the Act at any time, or from time to time, as had been requested by the(b 16697) 4 M 2
Council, but the Council could rest assured that the Government would suspend the date of operation as long as possible, provided that the Home Office were convinced that it was necessary to do so.PUBLIC AUTHORITY AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. The National Council met on the 19th November. It was reported that a majority of the District Councils were in favour of a conference of District Councils, and it was agreed to hold such a conference^in January. As a result of the refusal of the employers&apos; side of the District Council for the East Coast Area to accept the schedule of basic rates recommended by their sub-committee, a deputation was received, and the National Council recommended the acceptance of the schedule with a slight modification of wording.Gas. The National Council met on the 24th November. The question of the education of workers was considered. The Council decided to form an advisory committee, to be nominated from the National Joint Industrial Council, the National Gas Council, the British Commercial Gas Association, the Institute of Gas Engineers, and the Board of Education, to formulate a scheme with the object of urging the Government to increase the facilities afforded by polytechnic schools for theoretical studies connected with the industry, and also of inducing the larger undertakings to provide internal lecturers on the practical side. The Council decided to send two representatives, with a watching brief, to the proposed conference of National Joint Industrial Councils.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). The National Council met on the 25th November. A letter from the County Councils Association, notifying the association^ withdrawal from the Council, was considered. Strong objection was taken by both sides of the Council and it was agreed to request the Ministry to use their influence in the matter. Progress was reported respecting the formation, of Provincial Councils in a number of areas. A conference of representatives of local authorities in Lancashire and Cheshire, and representatives&apos; of the staff associations and trade unions concerned, on the 23rd November, agreed that a Provincial Council be formed for the area, consisting of 24 representatives on each side. The allocation of seats as among the several groups of local authorities was determined and the staff associations represented decided to allocate their seats pro rata to their ascertained membership employed in the services concerned in the area.TEXTILES.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. In accordance with the agreement made within the Joint Industrial Council in August, the Emergency Committee on the 26th November resolved that, in consequence of the rise of the cost-of-living index number to 176, the cost-of-living wage of the employees, which now stands at 155 per cent., should be advanced, as from the pay-day in the week ending the 4th December and for the pay week preceding that date, in the proportion of 175 to 155, with proportionate increases to piece-workers. The minimum rates for a 48-hour week in the manufacturing section are, for men 21 years of age, unscheduled, 87s. 9d.; for men 21 years of age, in occupations scheduled in scale, 91s. 5d.; and for women 18 years of age, 53s. 9d.Woollen Trades (West Wales). An agreement has been reached in connection with the strike* at the Cwerchyr Mill and the subsequent lock-out throughout West Wales. Resumption of work took place on the 22nd November. The principal clause of the agreement is the re-instatement of the dismissed workman in his old position, hut at the rate of wages to which his age entitled him, and full consideration of his case at a further joint conference on the 23rd November.MINING.Non-Ferrous Mining.-T)ie Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 25th November. Matters arising out of Award No. 402 of the Industrial Court were settled. The provision of transport facilities in mining districts was again discussed, and Mr. J. Wignall, M.P., undertook to put a question to the President of the Board of Trade asking whether any decision had been arrived at on this point, and on the question of the purchase of Australian concentrates.
SPELTER AND LEAD MANUFACTURE.Hardware Workers (Manchester). After a conference convened by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Manchester, the following advances were conceded to the members of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union employed in the hardware department of Messrs. S. Gratrix, Ltd., Manchester : Male workers, 22 years of age and over, 7s. 6ci per week ; male workers, under 22 years, 4s. per week ; and female workers, 4s. per week.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Admiralty. The Industrial Council met on the 19th November. The possibility of granting smoking facilities in the dockyards was discussed, and the official side intimated that certain facilities might be considered as an experiment, on the understanding that this should not prejudice a reversion if necessary.As a result of a previous discussion on an Admiralty Order discouraging recognition of shop stewards by yard officers, the official side had agreed to supplement the order by directing that elected representatives of the men serving on &quot; Whitley &quot; committees should be recognised by the yard officers as entitled to represent the men. On this matter dissatisfaction was expressed by some members on the trade union side with this qualified recognition, which, it was represented, would intensify the distrust of the &quot;Whitley&quot; movement by certain shop stewards.The trade union side complained that a system of payment by results was being introduced by yard officers among the joiners, against the established practice of the unions concerned, and without previous consultation with any committee set up under the &quot; Whitley &quot; scheme. It was agreed that this was a trade matter, which should he considered by the Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council. Among other items on the agenda also referred to the Shipbuilding Trade Joint Council were an application for increases in the extra remuneration for work in confined spaces and abnormally dirty places, and an application for the revision of the scale of payment for work on steam trials.Among other questions discussed were mulcts for late attendance, which the Admiralty agreed to reduce, and &quot; walking time,&quot; which is being referred to yard committees for specific proposals.Air Ministry. At a meeting of the Industrial Council on the 24th November, a resolution was agreed recommending that the departmental councils should be represented on the Joint Co-ordinating Committee, and that representations to this effect should be made to the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury.PROFESSIONAL.Insurance Committees. The National Council met on the 19th November. Corre-spondence was read from certain insurance committees stating that they were unwilling to abide by the Councils wages agreement; various steps were agreed upon to bring these committees into line. The scheme for the grading of the staffs was agreed, and a portion of the scheme for-minimum salaries for clerks to committees ; the remainder of the latter scheme was deferred. The liaison officer was requested to give further help in setting up district committees. Another matter discussed was the propaganda which is being carried on to persuade employers and employees to join, the constituent associations.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.London Shop Assistants: New Wages Demands. A representative of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks called to discuss the application for an approved scale of wages and conditions made on behalf of the members of the union employed by a number of leading London firms.* In each case the application has been referred to the Retail Distributors&apos; Association, except by the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, Ltd., who have referred their case to the London Employers&apos; Association.A conference between representatives of the last-named association and the union has since been held, and, as the workpeople&apos;s representatives were unable to accept the employers&apos; offer, it was suggested that the claim should be referred to the Industrial Court for decision. From a recent letter received from the London Employers&apos; Association it would appear that the employers agree to this course.
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board (Great Britain). The Carding Sub-Committee, after considering the appropriate minimum rates of wages for female workers employed in the carding of hooks and eyes, or snap fasteners, and the appropriate piece-work basis time-rates for female piece-workers, less than 18 years of age, employed in carding any of the other articles within the scope of the Board, agreed to recommend the Board to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for female workers employed on these operations. The committee also agreed to recommend the Board to propose a piece-work basis time-rate of 1\d. per hour for female workers, of all ages, employed in carding hooks and eyes, or snap fasteners, with the proviso, that, in the case of female workers to whom this rate is applicable, an ordinary worker shall be taken to be a female worker of 17 and under 18 years of age. It was agreed not to make any recommendation regarding the piece-work basis time-rates for female workers, under 18 years of age, employed in carding other articles within the scope of the Board.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board adopted recommendations by the Administrative Committee in respect of the definition of pan work, and of the classification of hard and soft woods, and after considerable discussion, reached agreement in respect of the remuneration of female workers employed on setting only.C&amp;finland Furniture and Cerement-Making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered the proposed variation of the minimum rates for male workers, 21 years of age and over, in the coffin furniture section, as set out in their Notice of Proposal dated the 19th August,* and resolved unanimously to vary the minimum rates accordingly.The question of a proposed variation of the minimum rates for female workers in the cerement-making section was again deferred.The Board agreed to send representatives to a joint conference with the Button-Making Trade Board, the Pin, Hook and Eye and Snap Fastener Trade Board, and the Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board, to consider whether they shall recommend that the four Boards should be amalgamated in one Trade Board,Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board, after consideration of the objections lodged against their Proposals, of the 18th September, to vary general minimum time-rates and overtime rates in respect of certain classes of male workers, agreed to vary the minimum rates as proposed.!The Administrative Committee resolved that the Ministry should be informed that the committee preferred to deal with applications for permits of exemption themselves, but that should cases arise in which the committee feel that the assistance of the Local* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 6, 7th August, p. 223.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 13, 25th September, p. 401.GENERAL.Reduction of Wages Apparently Consequent upon the Expiry of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts. It is reported by the Chief Conciliation Officer, Birmingham, that a fairly definite movement for a reduction of.wages appears to have begun among the smaller firms in the Leicester hosiery trades. The employers concerned argue that they can get orders at reduced rates, but can only take them by reducing wages. Larger firms have, so far, taken no similar action, and in some cases have stated that at the moment reductions of wages would not improve the employment position. About 600 workpeople are now involved in disputes arising from proposed reductions.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 628 to 635, 640 and 641.]
General Department-continued.Employment Committees could suitably be employed, they will at once communicate with the Ministry.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (Scotland). At their first meeting the Board resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix general minimum time rates and overtime rates for all male and female workers, 14 years of age and over, employed in the trade.The Board considered a latter from the Ministry on the subject of the draft Special Order relating to the meat distributive trade, and agreed to inform the Minister of their concurrence in the proposal to modify the Special Order, 1920, for the Grocery and Pro-visions Trade, to the extent only of excluding from that Order any business establishment, branch or department, in which 12 or more grocery articles are exposed for sale, but in which the main business is that described in the appendix to the draft Special Order for the meat distributive trade.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Corset Trade Board. The Minister has made an Order dated the 18th November, confirming minimum rates of wages, as varied for male and female workers, and has specified the 29th November as the date from which these rates shall become effective.The general minimum time-rate for female workers, including home workers, is 9f cZ. per hour ; lower rates are fixed for learners, ranging according to the age of commencement and the period of previous employment in the trade. The piece-work basis time-rate for female workers, including homeworkers, is lOfcZ. per hour.The general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates are Is. 9d. and Is. 10^. per Lour, respectively, for male workers employed as cutters, markers-out (other than process workers), hand pressers, matchers-up and shaders, with not less than five years&apos; experience in these operations after the age of 19 years, and Is. Id. and Is. 8^d. per hour if with less than five years&apos; but not less than three years&apos; experience after that age; ls.5d. and is. &amp;\&amp;., respectively, for male workers employed as folders, hand-fitters, parters, separators and makers-up, with not less than three years&apos; experience in these operations after the age of 19 years; Is. i\d. and Is. Qd., respectively, for male workers employed as warehousemen and packers, 22 years of age and upwards, with not less than two years&apos; experience as such ; and, for male workers other than those specified above, a piece-work basis time-rate of Is. 5d. per hour for male workers of all ages, and general minimum time-rates of Is. Z\d. per hour for workers, 22 years of age and upwards, and Is. \\d. per hour for workers of 21 and under 22 years of age ; with corresponding lower rates for younger workers.The overtime rates for male and female workers, whether employed on time-work or on piece-work, are, for the first two hours of overtime on any day except Saturday, Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, time-and-a-quarter; for overtime after the first two hours on any day except Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, and for all overtime on Saturday, when a worker customarily attends six days a week, time-and-a-half; for all time worked on Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, double time ; and for all hours worked in any week in excess of 48, time-and-a-quarter, except in so far as higher overtime rates are payable. For the purpose of these overtime rates the Trade Board have declared the normal number of hours to be 48 in any week ; 9 on any week-day olher than Saturday ; and 5 on Saturday.Where it is the established practice for a worker to attend only five days a week, the overtime rates shall not apply until the number of hours worked exceeds 9^, and the overtime rates for Saturday shall then be, for the first two hours, time-and-a-quarter, and after the first two hours, time-and-a-half.Linen and. Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and Linen Piece Goods Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 22nd November, to fix general minimum time-rates for female learners, and for female workers under 18 years of age other than learners, according to the age of commencement and the period of previous employment in the trade.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 23rd November, to vary general minimum piece-rates, for male pan-hands who put up and sharpen bits, by the addition of the following extras :-Is. id. per week for bass pan-hands, and Is. per week for other pan-hands ; and also to vary the pro-visions of Part I of the Schedule to the Minister&apos;s Order dated the 15th October, by substituting Is. 8^d. per hour for Is. 5$d. per hour as the basis rate for piece-workers where no general minimum piece-rates are applicable.ESTABLISHMENT AND AMENDMENT OF TRADE BOARDS.New Boards.-Th.q Minister has made Regulations, dated the 24th November, with respect to the constitution and proceedings of the Made-Up Textiles Trade Board (Great Britain).

Reports give no indication.of recovery in industries which for some time past have been suffering from acute depression. There are indications that the resettlement of industry after the coal strike is not as rapid as was at first expected. Abnormal unemployment and extensive under-employment are the rule, rather than the exception, in most industries.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. Shortage of material is still reported from a number of shipbuilding centres in Scotland. Except at Leith, ship repair work is likely to continue an uncertain quantity for some little time to come. Conditions at Airdrie are regarded as normal, and the percentage of unemployed men is exceedingly small. Shortage of material, due to the closing of the iron and steel works- during the coal strike, is reported to be making havoc with shipbuilding firms in the Tyne, Wear, and Hartlepool areas. The steel and iron works are, however, now getting into full swing, and it is hoped that most of the shipbuilding labour will be reabsorbed. The shipbuilding yards at Chepstow are quiet, no new hands having been engaged for some time. In the ship-repairing industry, the only port in South Wales where the position would appear satis-factory is Swansea, where all workers except fitters are fully employed. At Bute Docks, of 700 men notified as unemployed, 400 are boilermakers. The position in the Liverpool and Birkenhead district shows a marked improvement since the settlement of the ship-wrights&apos; strike. Owing to foreign competition, the outlook at Southampton is stated to be far from promising.  At Barnstaple the shipbuilding trade continues brisk.Reports from the cotton centres in the North-Western Division show that most employers are definitely committed to restricted output, owing to an acute scarcity of new orders. The prospects of improvement mentioned in recent reports, based apparently on the placing of incidental orders, do not yet show any signs of maturing. The effect of the decreased manufacture is now being felt in the warehouse and shipping sections in
Manchester. A similar state of affairs obtains in the wholesale clothing, hatting, leather, rubber, soap, linoleum, motor and engineering industries in this division. Exchange registers generally are loaded with unskilled and semi-skilled workmen, for whom it is almost impossible to find suitable vacancies.The majority of the mills engaged in the woollen textile trade are working short time ; and a similar position obtains in the hosiery and lace trades. There is little prospect of any immediate improvement. The boot and shoe industry remains dull. A hope of improvement is entertained, however, as there appears to be a certain amount of inquiry by wholesale buyers in connection with contracts for the spring season. Unemployment in the needle, fish-hook and fishing tackle trades is inconsiderable, but the chain industry is slack owing to a shortage of iron.In. the building trades, the position in London has not varied much, except in the painting trade, which is experiencing severe depression. It is still difficult to obtain brick-layers, plasterers and joiners, but the situation in respect of carpenters is easier. A great number of unskilled labourers are still out of employment, and the position is not expected to improve for some considerable time.In the London area, abnormal unemployment occurs in the unskilled trades ; the types which appear to be particularly affected are porters, carmen and general labourers.Industrial Developments. At Newark, Messrs. Scott &amp; Middleton have secured a contract for a concrete bridge over the Trent, which it is estimated will cost  40,000. The Great Western Railway Co. have made arrangements to start building operations on their new engineering works and engine sheds at Llanelly. Pit-wood imports are heavy in the South Wales district, and, providing railway transport is available, a considerable number of transport workers will be employed on this work during the next few months.Labour Reductions. At Maidstone 430 men, 300 of whom are skilled, are being dis-charged by the Tilling Stevens Motors, Ltd., owing to the cancellation of orders and general depression in the trade. A receiver has been appointed for Messrs. Martinsyde, Ltd., Woking, and it is expected that a large number of men will he discharged during the next week. At Lowestoft, 100 men have been discharged from the food preserving factories of Messrs. C. &amp; E. Morton, Ltd., and Messrs. Maconochie Bros., Ltd., on the conclusion of the fishing season. The Wolverhampton Corrugated Iron Co., Ltd., have stopped upwards of 200 men in their galvanising department owing to a shortage of orders. The Craigola Fuel Co., Clydach, have closed down permanently, and discharged 80 workpeople.Some 100 ship repairers have been paid off by Messrs. Smith&apos;s Dock Co., Ltd., from their Tyne docks, owing to the completion of contracts. They have little prospect at present of absorption locally, and it is stated that some are leaving for Rotterdam, where it is understood that labour is in demand.Shortage of Labour. The shortage of moulders is still pronounced. Messrs. Worthing-ton-Simpson, Ltd., Newark, are having to import large quantities of castings from Belgium owing to the shortage of this type of labour.Shortage of Material. In addition to the shortage of material in the shipbuilding industry, a shortage of steel is reported from Earlstown and Bilston. Difiiculty in obtaining cement is still retarding work on the roads in Camberwell.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Depression continues in all the large staple industries, although minor improvements are noted in certain areas. Generally, however, unemployment and under-employment are both on the increase.Local Reports. In the North-Western Division the volume of short-time employment in the textile industry is still very great; practically all Exchanges in the textile areas report large numbers of part-time workers on the registers. At Burnley the depression in the cotton trade is becoming very marked, half of the looms being now idle, and in the Preston area unemployment is increasing.- At Glossop, in addition to short time in all cotton spinning and manufacturing factories, the calico printing and bleaching trades are in a similar state.At Stockport, general unemployment is increasing in the textile mills, leather mills and hatting establishments. At Crewe, Levenshulme, Wigan and Manchester the clothing trade is very slack. The leather trade is depressed at Hyde; stationery manufacture at Leigh; the shirt making and silk making-up trade at Openshaw; silk and cable work at Liverpool; rubber works at Salford; and waterproof garment making at Warrington.(b 16697) 4N
Local shortages of labour exist at Crewe, for fustian cutters, but only local applicants are accepted; at Farnworth for experienced weavers, but, owing to shortage of housing accommodation, workers cannot be imported; at Liverpool for nurse probationers; at Royton for creelers and card-room workers ; and at Warrington for cardboard box makers.The Yorkshire and East Midlands Division report that under-employment is on the increase. In the textile areas the majority of the mills are on short time, and operatives with 20 years&apos; experience are said to be out of work. There is still an unsatisfied demand for workers in certain processes of the silver and cutlery trade, but, although Sheffield has a live register of nearly 1,000 women, none have the necessary qualifications, and the demand is not sufficiently acute to encourage employers to train unskilled workers.Slackness is again reported in the South Midlands and Eastern Division, notably in the wholesale clothing industry, the boot and shoe trade, the underclothing trade and the hosiery and straw hat trades. The last trade, however, is showing some signs of recovery at St. Albans.The live register at Leicester stands at 400 ; the Wolsey Hosiery Co., have paid off all their married women, affecting nearly 100 workers. With the end of the fishing season nearly 400 women have been discharged from fish preserving and canning firms in Lowestoft.  Silk workers are still on short time at Braintree.General depression is reported from the West Midlands Division. At Coventry the unemployment situation has grown somewhat worse. Several firms have started working short-time three days a week, among them the Daimler Co., Ltd., employing about 4,000 workpeople. At Kidderminster the spinning mills are on short time, and several firms in the carpet trade are now making for stock. At Leek slackness in the silk industry continues. At Smethwick over 1,000 women are on the live register, the majority married, with young children. Local employers prefer to employ single women. Great depression is reported in the leather and tailoring trades at Walsall. At Nuneaton a new hosiery factory is completed, but very few workers have been engaged at present. With its full complement it will absorb 150 women.The pottery trade appears to be returning to the normal, according to reports from Burslem, Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, and Hanley, although at the last town some unsettle-ment is still reported as a result of the coal strike.General unemployment and high live registers are reported from the industrial areas in London. In Bermondsey and Deptford slackness in the tin box trade continues, and this, it is said, in spite of the fact that prices have fallen and that a large consignment of tin is available.  The food-packing factories are also slack.General slackness is reported from the South-Western Division. Unemployment is increasing in the clothing industry at Basingstoke and Bristol; shirt and collar workers are on short time at Taunton, and orders for collars have been cancelled at Barnstaple.In the Northern Division trade depression is increasing at Carlisle, and more girls are willing to adopt domestic service. At Elswick 40 women tracers employed by Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., have been given notice, and it is expected that 30 more will receive notice this week. At Newcastle clothing machinists are unemployed. The ropery workers have resumed full time at Willington Quay.In Scotland workers are on short time in all the textile areas. Wool spinners are on short time at Alloa, and at Galashiels workers are being dismissed from the mills, owing to depression in the woollen trade. At Inverness the tweed mills are suspending workers. The flax mills are working short time at Arbroath and Johnstone. At Dundee, however, most of the jute mills have resumed full time, and the textile workers registered at Dumbarton have, with few exceptions, been re-instated with the Turkey Red Co., Ltd.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. Committees are still endeavouring to move various local authorities to push forward schemes to relieve unemployment. Hackney suggest that, in the event of public relief work being undertaken in the district, only unemployed men registered at the Exchange, and suitable for the work, should be engaged. Reading urge the Minister to make some provision for unemployed men who were not called to the Colours.The Portsmouth Committee report satisfactory progress in regard to the proposed ship-breaking scheme, and state that a deputation are to wait on the Minister to discuss tke^possibility of accelerating progress.
A deputation from the West Somerset Committee to the Taunton Borough Council reported that the Council had approved a recommendation for the construction of a road, by direct labour, at an estimated cost of  4,800.The Sheffield Committee have adopted a recommendation that the Ministry of Health should be urged to employ disabled ex-Service men to deal with the special work in connection with the National Health Insurance Act, in the performance of which, it was understood, the present proposals only contemplated the employment of girls, or of the permanent staff on overtime.Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance. The Stalybridge Committee have asked that, in order to facilitate the work of the Courts of Referees under the Un-employment Insurance Act, the attention of the department be drawn to the functions of the chairman of a Court of Referees, and would be glad if any improvement could be made to lessen, or avoid, friction between the chairmen and the members.Bermondsey point out that, while a workman, who knowingly makes a false statement in order to obtain unemployment benefit or donation is liable to prosecution, an employer who makes a false statement, with intention to deprive his late workman of benefit, is not liable. They have urged that the penal clause be made to apply equally to employers and workpeople.Training. Bermondsey have called attention to the position of youths who joined the army, in some cases at 16 or 17 years of age, and are now unable to obtain employ -ment. They have requested the Minister to provide adequate facilities for training these youths.A conference held at Bristol, between representatives of Local Employment Committees in the South-Western Division, and officers of the Ministry, passed a resolution asking the Training Department to investigate the pencil-making and bulb-growing industries, and such other industries as might be suitable, with a view to providing training and employment for disabled men, under direct Government control. The conference also considered that the training of fit men should be undertaken, more especially in trades not suitable for a disabled man, such as the building trade. They recommended that the National Trade Advisory Committees should at once consider the training of fit men up to the age of 27 years.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION, AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 18th November, show 58,277 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  66,817 13s. 3d.Unemployment Insurance. Payments of unemployment insurance benefit made at local offices, during the week ending the 12th November, involved -an amount of  56,930 18s.The balance standing to the credit of the Unemployment Fund on the 30th October was  21,886,993. During the period from the 25th September to the 30th October,  165,000 was transferred to the National Debt Commissioners for investment, making the total sum transferred  21,875,000.The number of advances made in September was 5,333, divided into 1,394 recover-able advances and 3,939 non-recoverable advances. The total amount of recoverable advances was  1,218, compared with a total for August of  1,224.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 24th November, 22,558 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given cover 246,076 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controllers report that the recent coal strike has, in some instances, seriously retarded the progress of the scheme. In Wales, the civic committees had to suspend their activities during the strike, but are now sitting again and obtaining good results.The Divisional Controller for the West Midlands Division states that the experience obtained in his division tends to show that the personal canvassing of employers produces the best results, particularly in the creation of vacancies for disabled men. He also considers that the publicity recently given to the disabled men who are unemployed has had considerable influence in inducing employers to make special efforts, in spite of trade depression and unrest, to retain disabled men in their service.(b 16697) 4 N 2
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics-During the week ending the 19th November the Appointments Department placed 426 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 45,127. Of these, 6,171 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 832 ex-Service men and 30 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 19th November was 11,846 ex-Service men and 1,421 civilians. At the same date 1,245 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 591 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme-During the week ending the 19th November the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 77 officers and men of similar educational qualifications, of which 41 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,256 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 50,156 for training of the type provided by other Government Departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,478 applications, of which 23,056 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,893 applications, and sanctioned grants in 18,077 cases.At Wolverhampton a man with. 100 per cent, disability has been placed as a chauffeur ; and another man, wounded in the left arm, who has also lost some of his fingers, was placed as a shorthand typist after training.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Employment of Girls in Cotton Mills. The Leigh Juvenile Advisory Committee recently discussed the position of learners in the cotton industry. It was reported that several firms were dispensing with the services of girls in the spinning rooms, as the work there was considered unsuitable for them. The committee decided to recommend the girls from the spinning rooms to learn cotton weaving.Employment of Girls in Domestic Service. The Aberdare, Leeds, Medway, Peter-borough, Shepherds Bush and Shrewsbury Juvenile Employment Committees have now approved standard conditions for the employment of juveniles in resident domestic service. The wages recommended for girls of 14 vary from 4s. to 7s. per week, and for those of 17 years of age from 7s. to 15s. per week. The Shrewsbury Committee have fixed the lowest rate; the highest rate is suggested for Leeds, where the attraction of the mills has to be met. Most of the committees suggest time off in addition to a half-holiday each week, In all cases but one, two weeks&apos; holiday per annum, with pay, is recommended. The Medway Committee suggest one week&apos;s holiday, with pay, as the minimum.Apprentices (Building). In order that new arrangements for technical classes might be fully explained, the Bristol Building Trades Apprenticeship Committee recently convened a meeting of apprentices. Almost all the 80 boys apprenticed, or on trial for apprentice-ship, under the committee&apos;s scheme attended. The Sunderland Building Trades Apprentice-ship Committee have also taken special steps to encourage attendance at technical classes. Apprentices in the trade were invited to attend a special meeting of the committee. The principal of the technical college was present; 34 boys attended, and 19 who were not then attending classes were persuaded to enrol forthwith.[References to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on page 649.]
Business Training Scheme.-During the week ending the 19th November, the Appoint-ments Department received 252 applications for training under this new scheme, and during the same period 76 training vacancies were registered by employers.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant.-The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 920 cases, in 436 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government depart-ments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 234 cases, and abandoned training in 41; 139 are still in training and 22 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 23rd November, 24,993 men were in training, as against 25,047 on the 16th November and 25,024 on the 26th October. The number of men placed in training during the week was 402. There were 16,944 men awaiting training, the corres-ponding totals for the 16th November and the 26th October being 17,075 and 17,829, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 20,979, the totals for the 16th November and the 26th October being 20,523 and 19,030 respectively.The falling off in the number of men placed in training suggests that the practical closure of certain trades is beginning to show its effects, while the very slow rate of reduc-tion in the waiting list may well be due to a continuance of the rise in the number of appli-cants shown last month.During October the number of men in training rose appreciably, and by the end of the month was in excess of-25,000. The number of terminations, nearly 1,900, was also very satisfactory. But the waiting list showed little change. There was a falling off in the number of men accepted for training, and the number of new names added increased considerably.So far as training facilities are concerned, the department seem to be quickly reaching the stage of having made reasonably adequate provision. The difficulties are now mainly external, and very largely due to causes over which the department have no control.Elementary Teachers. A proposal has been made that the premises at Erith should be used as a training college, and the matter is under consideration by the Board of Education.Hostels, Canteens and Welfare. Schemes for starting mess-rooms or small canteens at the Bermondsey and the Blackheath factories, to be managed by the United Services Co-operative Canteens, Ltd., have been approved by the Divisional Director. The work will be carried out when an estimate for equipment has been received from the Office of Works.At the Brighton diamond cutting factory, the question of finding help for men requiring spectacles has been raised by the Divisional Director. It has been decided that this matter can be treated as a welfare question, and that the United Services Fund might be expected to provide assistance.Government Instructional Factories. The Luton Factory, opened at the beginning of the month, has now 79 men in training. A considerable proportion would appear to be suffering from heavy disability. The numbers at Chiswick and Hornsey have risen to 285 and 189 respectively, and at Bristol the number has at last exceeded 200. At Sarisbury Court, the total is rapidly approaching 500.The New Basford Factory was recently visited by the Minister, and the Mayor and the Town Clerk of Nottingham. The work carried on was inspected in detail, and subse-quently the Minister addressed the whole body of men.The quality of the work carried out in the boot and shoe class at the Cardiff Factory seems to be of a particularly high order. The boots ordered by the Minister and by the members of Parliament for Cardiff have been delivered, and their excellence has afforded a text for a brief notice in the local newspapers.National Trade Advisory Committees : Bespoke Tailonng.-A meeting was held on the 17th November, to consider the best methods of supplying material to tailoring training centres, and of disposing of the finished garments.  It was agreed that patterns should be
submitted to the Local Technical Advisory Committee for approval, and purchases made locally by the Divisional Director for three months&apos; stock. When further supplies are required, the committee should change the colour and texture at discretion, in order to vary the work of the trainees.It was also agreed that all trainees in&apos; Government Instructional Factories should be allowed to order, through the manager, suits for their own wear, at the cost of cloth and trimmings, plus 10 per cent.; and that suits sold to others be charged at the cost of material and trimmings, plus the log rate for labour paid in second-class shops in the district.A joint conference is being arranged with the Wholesale Clothing Manufacturers&apos; Federation of Great Britain to consider the question of bulk disposal.The committee also passed a resolution desiring to give evidence before the inter-departmental committee, who are considering the position of badly disabled men.National Trade Advisory Committees: Furniture. A meeting was held on the 17th November. At a previous meeting the committee appointed a deputation to visit the Epsom Convalescent Centre, and the report of the deputation was considered. It was agreed to approve in principle of the training, but it was considered essential that the Ministry of Pensions should clearly point out to the men that training in such centres was no guarantee that they would be permitted to continue training after leaving the centre, and that only such, men as had been passed by Local Technical Advisory Committees would be guaranteed continuance of training. It was agreed that each man, on commencing a course of training in any of the processes of the trade, should sign an. acknowledgment of the position.Notice of motion had been given by a member of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association that the committee consider the percentage of men to be trained to the number of men receiving the full trade rates. The motion was adjourned, and the secretary was instructed to obtain, through the Local Technical Advisory Committees, the number of skilled men in all processes of the trade, drawing the full district rate, and the number of men employed in the trade.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 24th November, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 44,904 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanc-tioned in respect of 42,935 apprentices, employed by 17,047 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 13,877.Applications. In parts, at any rate, of the London and South-Eastern area, the position in regard to &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices appears to be favourable.At Aberdeen and Inverness, there is reported an almost complete cessation of inquiries in regard to applications. At Aberdeen, however, a few recently demobilised men are still applying.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. In the plumbing trade at Edinburgh, some employers are still apparently refusing to carry out Lord Hunter&apos;s award. Most firms, and the associations, seem to be supporting it loyally, but the associations seem to be unable to control their recalcitrant members. As regards cases reserved for special consideration, a committee of employers and workpeople has been established, before which the firms concerned are to be invited to appear.Training in Operation. Great interest in training under the Pottery Scheme is exhibited by the Wages and Conditions Committee of the National Joint Council for the industry, to whom its administration has been entrusted. Difficulties and complaints in regard to training were at one time reported in the case of apprentices on piece-work, and as a result special measures have been taken. The firms concerned send in training reports, which are. investigated by the workpeople&apos;s secretary of the Council, and, when he is satisfied of their accuracy, are forwarded to the chairman of the committee, and eventually to local headquarters.   The results so far appear to have been excellent.Unemployment-Local headquarters for the North-Western area report that com-paratively few apprentices under the Scheme were thrown out of employment in their area by the coal strike. They have secured a promise from an important Liverpool firm of shipbuilders to grant special consideration during periods of slackness to apprentices under the Scheme. In the Northern area, suspended apprentices have been favourably affected by the considerable improvement in the situation since the strike, except in the case of shipbuilding, which is still suffering from the diversion of orders to foreign ports.
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Cost of Living.Colonel Newman asked the Prime Minister whether he is aware that, in spite of the pronounced fall during the past two months in the price of raw and manufactured materials, with the exception of wheat which is controlled by Government, the official statisticians of the Labour Ministry are able to record an advance in the average level of food, clothing, fuel and light; and will he appoint a Select Committee to investigate the methods by which these officials figures are arrived at.Dr. Macnamara: I have been asked to reply. I am aware that the wholesale prices of some commodities, such as textile raw materials and cotton cloth, have shown a decline during the past two or three months, and this decline has already been partly reflected in the Ministry of Labour figures as to clothing prices, which showed a slight fall on average during October. The rise in the index number is due mainly, however, to the recent increase in the price of bread, and partly to increases in the cost of certain items of working-class expenditure, such as milk, eggs, rents and workmen&apos;s fares, which are included in the institutional Training. In the South-Western area, efforts to provide unemployed apprentices with institutional training are hindered by difficulties in regard to the main-tenance allowance, in cases where the apprentices must leave home. Local headquarters urge, therefore, that, without an increase, apprentices in districts which lack facilities will be unable to accept facilities elsewhere.  The matter is being taken up by headquarters.General Training.Apprenticeships (Building). Satisfactory progress in regard to the National Scheme is reported from various districts. In the Northern area local headquarters report that much work has been carried out in preparation for the formation of local Apprenticeship Committees. In Cumberland the master builders have definitely decided to support the scheme and the establishment of committees ; and the Westmoreland employers also seem favourable. The Midland Federation of Building Trade Employers have adopted the wages scale of the scheme, and decided upon the immediate establishment of Apprenticeship Com-mittees. Their council also recommend that apprentices shall receive technical instruction for one day a week.Farriery. A recent inquiry into methods of training, carried out at the request of the employers&apos; and work peoples&apos; associations, has produced interesting results. In Glasgow the number of apprentices appears to be small. In the Northern area, it is held that immediate steps are required to safeguard the industry from dying out. In the case of the Weston branch of the Master Farriers&apos; Association, in the South-Western area, the older employers consider that the trade has no future, and that no apprenticeship scheme is necessary. Many of them assert that they would not allow their sons to enter the industry. The younger men, however, while admitting that few boys can be absorbed by firms engaged solely in shoeing horses, are confident that, with proper attention to recruitment and train-ing, and adequate technical instruction, especially in connection with agricultural machinery, the number of general smiths can be largely increased. One employer, who was being &quot; snowed under &quot; with agricultural repairs, finds the journeymen inadequate owing to their lack of acquaintance with the machines, and suggested improved training of boys as the only remedy.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also he found on pages 638, 644, 645 and 646.]
Appendix- continued.Ministry of Labour index numbers but are not included in some of the well-known whole-sale prices index numbers. I am advised I can add nothing to the answer already given as to a Committee. (25th November.)Disabled Men : Employment.Lord II. Cavendish-Bentinck asked the Minister of Labour if he will state how many men there are in receipt of high disability pensions; and, in view of the fact that a great proportion of these men will be incapable of taking their places in industrial life, whether the Government contemplate affording them facilities for employment under favourable and suitable conditions in which they would be capable of contributing to their own livelihood.&apos;Dr. Macnamara: I am afraid it is the fact that notwithstanding our Training Scheme, and the generally patriotic attitude of employers towards disabled men, there are a number  probably a very large number-of disabled ex-Service men who will probably never be able to obtain permanent employment under the ordinary industrial conditions. On the 22nd September last I appointed an Inter-Departmental Committee, including representa-tives of the Employment and Training Departments, and of the Ministry of Pensions, with my hon. friend, the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry, as President, to consider the problem presented by these men, and examine the-question of what provision it may be necessary to make for them. My hon. friend promises me an early report, and I need not say that it will receive our closest consideration. (24th November.)DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT.Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill.In Standing Committee of the House of Commons, on the 25th November, a new clause was added to the Bill, providing that, if &quot; it appears to the Minister of Labour that im-mediate action is necessary for the purpose of dealing with unemployment, and that land cannot be acquired under the foregoing provisions of this Act with such expedition as the case requires, he may certify accordingly &quot; ; whereupon the Minister of Transport, or any local authority with his approval, shall have power to take possession of land required in connection with the construction of any arterial road; provided that no permanent building is entered on, and that the land in question &quot; could, under some enactment in force at the commencement of this Act, have been authorised to be acquired compulsorily for, or in connection with, the construction or improvement of a road,&quot; and that seven days notice of intention is given to the owner and occupier of the land. Mr. Munro explained that the clause was introduced to meet the views of the London County Council, who held that the procedure of the Bill as it stood was too dilatory to be satisfactory.In the Report stage, on the 26th November, a new clause was added rendering in-applicable to the construction of any new road the provisions of Section 9 (2) of the Develop-ment and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909, where the Minister of Labour certifies that, having regard to the unemployment in any area, it is desirable that the construction of the new road should be proceeded with forthwith. Mr. Munro explained that the sub-section of the Act in question provided for certain consultations with the road authorities before a scheme was entered into, which must have occasioned delay.Mr. Hay day moved that the word &quot; exceptional&quot; be omitted from Clause 1, which provided that the powers conferred for accelerating the compulsory acquisition of, and entry on, land should not be exercised unless the Minister of Labour certified that&quot; having regard to the exceptional amount of unemployment existing in any area &quot; such a course was desirable&quot;. The amendment was accepted. An amendment was made providing that the Minister of Labour shall take into consideration any representations made to him by any local authority to the effect that he should issue a certificate.The Bill was read the third time and passed on the same day. In the course of the Debate, the Minister of Labour gave an account of the main schemes already contemplated in various parts of the country.Women, Young Persons and Children (Employment) Bill.For the proceedings in connection with this Bill, see p. 629 above.
