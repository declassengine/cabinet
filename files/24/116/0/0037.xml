This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government!56SECRET.31I , 1 &apos; imJJ THE CABINET.PAYMENT OF DEBTS BY SOVIET RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a letter which I have received from a lady who has been    0149 deprived by the Bolsheviks of her property in Russia and who protests against the    9333&quot; resumption of trade before Soviet Russia has paid its debts to British subjects.W.S.C.The War Office,Uh December. 1920.To the Right Hon. Winston Churchill, M.P. Dear Sir,I see according to a report in the papers that you, along with two or three others, were opposed to resuming trade with Soviet Russia until they acknowledged, and promised to pay, their debts to this country. I, along with a few hundreds more, hoped you would use your influence to secure that promise; at least, the Soviet Government ought to be made to repay what they have robbed British subjects of. I am a widow, with a lame delicate daughter, and my small fortune was invested in a cotton mill, near Moscow. This was taken over by the Bolsheviks in 1917, and been worked for their benefit since. I have had to give up my home and come to live with relatives, and my daughter is trying to earn her own living. My only son came from Russia, whore he had a good appointment, on the declaration of war. He was wounded in France and after the Armistice he volunteered to join General Denikin&apos;s forces in South Russia, returning and being demobilized this year. Fortunately Messrs. Mather and Platts, engineers, have given him a post, to their honour. Is it too late for anything to be done lor us ? I know there are hundreds of British subjects living now in this country in poverty, who were turned out of Russia with nothing more than they could carry, and only enough money to pay their fares home, the rest of their possessions being appropriated by the Bolsheviks. These are not Tzarist debts but Bolshevik debts, and ought to be paid by them. It is not pleasant to read that &quot; M. Krassin is paying twenty-two guineas per week for his flat,&quot; or that &quot; his family are enjoying their stay in London very much.&quot;Yours truly,(Mrs.) Blanche Lunn.
