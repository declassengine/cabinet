/fill   &apos;i\ &apos; v &apos;! /&quot;-II&apos; V it&apos;&apos;L&apos;t/IBL&amp; LOCUMiiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS LRITAMIC MAJESTY&apos;S QQVWMW)*-fP E c RET. O0 A B 1 il B T.CP.2296. * .....-......&apos; HOtgl      RULE......J&amp;ZZL.PRINCIPAL ..iLTERATIQflS 1143533 BY tb4 HOUSE OF LORDS.Memorandum by Sir Laming Worthington-Evans.Xs   SiiiiJiiTiiiS.Tho Houso of Lords has inserted provisions for a Second Chamber in both Southern and i! or thorn Parliaments,Tho Southern Senate is to bo elected and nominated by.-.-... in accordance with the scheme in the...........schedule.Tho northern Senate is tc havo two ox-officio members and ?A members elected by the House of Commons, as provided in the third schoctulo.Tho Government accepted the principle of the second Charmers in Committee in tho House of Commons, and under-tech to brina: in a scheme.     On report, the Government stated that they could not. fincl any suitable scheme and they inserted powers for the Council of Ireland to proposeschemes for second Chambers in the: Southern and northern Parliaments to be set up by identical acts in the twoHouseri of Commons,,The Senato proposed for the South will give some protection to a Protestant riinorityf but this protection would be greatly strengthened if the&apos;17 senators to be nominated by the Lord Lieutenant were nominated by him on the advice of the British Ministers,   As the Bill now stands the Lord Lieutenant in sc nominating, will act on the advice of his Irish Ministers..   Consequently, thore may be no protection given io minorities- in those nominated senators.As regards the Northern Sonatet&apos;it seems unwise to introduoe the principle of Nomination- merely to secure the presence of the Lord Layer of Belfast &apos;.and the Mayor of
o&quot;***   iZjDerry.    Either there should be a more substantial nomination by the Lord Lieutenant or nomination should be entirely omitted.I suggest.that we accept the two Senates just as thoy are on the ground that they are imposed by tho House of Lords, and as consideration for a bargain to got through the Sus-p enso ry 01au a o (sec pa ra.6.) 2 *     COUNCIL 0^&apos; IRELANDThe constitution of the Council of Ireland has boon amended,,     Instead of each Parliament nominating 20 members, 10 of whom must be members of the House of Commons, the amendments provide that each Parliament shall nominate 20 members, the Commons House nominating fe3 members and the Senate House 7, the election for nomination to take place by proportional representation.If the Ulster representatives will accept this position which,, having; regard to the constitution of the Senate of Northern Ireland,, they may do, I should be disposed to accept it also.There, has been added, to the powers of the Council the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act,.  . I would suggest that.this should be objected to.    There are two Board of Agriculture, and there would be hopeless overlapping with a third body administering one function relating to agriculture 39     SECOND CHAMBER U.....UNIT!.?) PARLIAMENT...An amendment has beon inserted limiting the powers of the Council, and the two Parliaments in the constitution of a united Parliament, but accepting- the principle of two Chambers the United. Parliament.     1 do not propose to object...-
3.   TAKING PRIVATE PROPERTY T GR PUBLIC lUKPOSSS WITHOUT COMPENSATION.An addition has boen made.to tho Clause prohibiting religious di sorimination, whioh provides that private property shall not bo taken for public purposes without a just compensation.      There is an impliod invitation to PTab property for private purposes without compensation, and on tho whole, I think it is worth objecting to the Amendment,4.    SIX Y3AR5 WITHOUT ALTERATION OF ELECTORAL LAWS,The Lords have inserted &quot;six years:l instead of &quot;three years&quot; before the expiration of which no alteration oan be mace In tho electoral laws,     &quot;Ulster representatives objected to proportional representation in Ulster and objected to a Government amendment in the same sense as the House of Lords amendment and the Government left the amendment to the House and the House negatived it,     I propose therefore to object to this amendment0 5.     SUR-TAX,The House of Lords have struck out power to charge sur-tax but have left the power to grant relief against super-tax and Income tax.   There will be considerable support to the amendment In the Commons and I should propose not to disagree with the amendment.   It seems to me probable that the question of privilege will arise and in that case I propose to waive the privilege.   If we agree to this amendment we may get through by consent:     the Suspensory Clause,6*    SUSPENSORY CLAtJSi-ii AND AFPOIKTffD .DAY.The House of Lords have made most material alterations^ They have struck out tho Suspensory Clause and they have struck out the provision that the appointed day cannot be later than 15 months nor earlier than one month, - They have provided, that   /
the appointed day can only bo fixed by R: solution of both Houses when satisfied that His Majesty&apos;s authority and the protection of life and property arc assured.in other anenonont appears to provide that box ore those Resolutions can bo passed, the Speaker of the british House must send notices to tho existing members elected to tho British Parliament for Irish constituencies, inviting them to saj w.hot nor they accept the Dili or not, am- if a majority in either part of Ireland accept the 3ill then tho Resolution nay to proposed.These clauses appear to me to bo wholly unworkable, I propose therefore to object and. to re-insert the SusponsorClause and the Clause relating to the appointee days as passed by the .. ouse of CommentThere is certain to be a conflict on those clauses, I u;. dor stand that they nave boon put in mainly because it is feared that if an election is hole in Southern Ireland now, it would   be an occasion for demonstration in favour of a separate Republic by persons who have no intention of sitting in the Parliament of Southern Ireland, accompanied by violent intimidation of any non-Republican candidates who might stand,I believe the modification of the Suspensory Clause enabling Crev.n Colony Government to be put into operation without the tost of an election would be acceptable to the herdst but I cannot eelievs that it could pass tho Commons without serious criticism.The two bargaining features which appear to remain in order to induce tno house of .jords not to insist on amending the Suspensory Clause would appear to bo  (l) Constitution of the Council. i.e. the introduction
of seven members elected by proportional representationof the Senate*&apos;fli)   The omission ox the sur-taxaIf an agreement can be arrived at with Lord Midloton&quot;no further formidablo opposition need be expected.Authority might be given to me to make a bargain,(Intda), Whitehall Gardens ?
