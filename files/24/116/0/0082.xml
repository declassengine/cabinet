PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The situation at the close of the week under review, so far as disputes actually in progress are concerned, is comparatively quiet. It is distinguished, however, from the previous week by the existence of a strike of shipyard joiners against a reduction in wages, which, with the exception of a few firms and places, extends over the whole of Great Britain, and affects some 20,000 men ; while the position with regard to tramwaymen, electrical power engineers and London shop assistants is threatening. It may, therefore, be said that the industrial situation is worse, and there is no prospect of an immediate improvement.The unemployment position continues to cause grave anxiety, and the failure in many cases of particular industries to recover from the effects of industrial disputes indicates the general state of trade depression. The Labour Joint Commission of Inquiry, who arrived in Dublin on the 30th November, have continued their activities in Ireland during the week. Generally speaking, public opinion is concentrated upon the two questions of Ireland and unemployment. The conference of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation on the 1st December, which endorsed an amalgamation scheme for the unions, affiliated to the Federation, who cater for dock labour, is important, and a feature of considerable interest is the apparently spontaneous development of an active organisation among unemployed ex-Service men in London.The Unemployment (Relief Works) Bill received its second reading in the House of Lords on the 30th November, was considered in Committee on the 1st December, and received its third reading on the following day. The most important amendment made was the limitation of the operation of the Bill to a period of 12 months from its commence-ment. Royal Assent was given to this Bill, and also to the Shops (Early Closing) (No. 2) Bill, on the 3rd December. The Report stage of the Women and Young Persons (Employ -ment in Lead Processes) Bill was taken in the House of Lords on the 30th November; the Bill was read the third time and returned to the Commons on the 6th December. A series of technical amendments have been made in the Bill, in order to meet criticisms by Lord Askwith, and representations from the London Chamber ofCommerce.The Report of the Departmental Committee of Inquiry upon Employment Exchanges has been published, and a summary of the more important conclusions and recommenda-tions of the Committee is given below. Attention may be drawn to the decision of the Friendly Societies to desist from their endeavour to take part in the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Employment Exchanges. In June, the Minister of Labour appointed a Departmental committee of Inquiry &quot; to examine the working and administration of the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain and to advise &quot;as to their future.&quot; The committee,* presided over by the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P., adopted their report on the 10th November, and it has now been published.The committee discuss in considerable detail the work of the Exchanges, and make numerous recommendations which affect all phases of that work. The general conclusion of the committee is that the Employment Exchanges must be retained as a national system, and are a necessary corollary to the State system of unemployment insurance.The committee give a considerable amount of attention to the connection between the Exchanges and unemployment insurance.   It is pointed out that the* The personnel of the committee was given in this Report, No. 21, 19th June, p. 716.
Administration of unemployment insurance was one of the main purposes of the establishment of the Employment Exchange system, and that the Act of 1920 practically completes the insurance scheme&apos; which the Exchanges were established to administer. This fact the committee regard as a special feature of the British system of Exchanges, and to it they attribute the wide distribution of the Exchanges over the whole kingdom, and the resulting heavy establishment charges. It is insisted that account must be taken of the function of the Exchanges in protecting the Unemployment Fund, even when no placing results; and, in this connection, the com-mittee point out that in 43 per cent, of the cases of disallowance of benefit, the decision was given on the ground of refusal of suitable work. The objection urged against the Exchanges by certain witnesses, mainly representing employers in well-organised trades, to the effect that their industries had no use for the Exchanges, is met by the argument that the Exchange system is of use to each industry, unless the industry has a special scheme under Section 18 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, because, without some such machinery, no industry can be insured against unemployment on the basis adopted by Parliament. All industries under the general scheme insure one another, and, therefore, an industry, though it has an adequate scheme of its own for dealing with vacancies, could not be insured unless there were also an adequate system of testing unemployment arising in the other industries with which it is actuarially associated for benefit.The main conclusions of the committee with regard to the work of the Exchanges in finding employment are : (1) The Exchanges have not succeeded in displacing, so far as was expected, other methods of finding work, and they are not generally popular. The Exchanges have not been fully used by and for highly skilled organised labour and the highest grades of unorganised labour. The Exchanges have been of value in the less organised, unorganised and in the unskilled trades generally.(2) Apart from domestic servants, skilled labour, as defined by the Ministry of Labour, predominates in the work of the Exchanges.(3) Organised labour in the insured trades under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1911-19, has made as much use of the Exchanges in obtaining employment as unorganised labour.The committee calculate that, on their present basis, the Exchanges receive during the year about 3,000,000 registrations by the workers, are informed by employers of 1,500,000 vacancies, and fill 1,000,000 vacancies. This last figure, which represents some 3,000 vacancies filled each day, is not regarded as satisfactory. The recommendation of the committee, however, is that the scope of the Exchanges should not be limited to persons compulsorily insured against unemployment and to the employers of such persons. No class of workpeople or employers should be excluded from taking advantage of the Exchanges to which in part they contribute. It is, moreover, the opinion of the committee that it would be anomalous for the Exchanges to abandon &quot; private domestic service,&quot; and that no valid reasons exist why the local offices in rural areas should not continue to deal with agricultural labour.The committee have arrived at the conclusion that the Local Employment Committees formed in connection with the Exchanges in 1917 have done invaluable work, especially during the resettlement period immediately following the war. They observe that there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of the view that these committees have not sufficient responsibility, and that the efficiency of the Exchanges would be increased if, more power were given to them. They recommend that the Local Employment Com-mittees should be consulted with regard to the appointment and promotion of Exchange staff, the choice and adaptation of premises and equipment for Exchanges, and the hours during which Exchanges should be open to the public. They should also be entrusted with the specific duty of giving the work of the Exchanges the necessary local publicity, and should advise the Ministry regarding the prevention of unemployment, for example, by appropriate expenditure upon public contracts in times of trade depression. In view of this latter function, they should be strengthened by the addition of representa-tives of the local administrative authority. A general recommendation is made that &quot; the Ministry of Labour should comply to the utmost with the expressed wishes of Local Employment Committees.&apos;&apos;The committee also are of opinion that, from time to time, questions will arise upon which the Minister of Labour will naturally wish to have the assistance of advisory bodies covering larger areas than do the Local Employment Committees. They recommend, therefore, that each committee should be invited to nominate a representative who will be available for attendance on their behalf at any conference of such representatives as may be found desirable at the headquarters of the divisional areas in which the Exchanges
* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 15, 9th October, p. 434. t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 2&apos;ith November, p. 625.are organised. A further recommendation is that representatives of all the committees in each divisional area should agree among themselves as to a limited number of individuals, perhaps five from each division, who should be available to attend any conference of such representatives which might be summoned in London. The only specific duty, however, which it is recommended to entrust to these divisional and central conferences, is the approval by divisional conferences of wages agreements, in order that the principle by which Employment Exchanges are prohibited from dealing with vacancies which do not offer conditions as good as those prescribed under statute, for example, by a Trade Board or by the Agricultural Wages Boards, may be extended to those industries in which wages and conditions of work are fairly completely governed by voluntary agreements between the organisations of workers and employers.The committee recommend four specific modifications in Exchange procedure. Firstly, the Employment Exchanges should not be available to employers or workpeople during a trade dispute. Secondly, the registration at the Exchanges of workpeople who are in permanent employment should be discouraged. Thirdly, the general practice of canvassing employers should so far as possible be curtailed ; but, on the other hand, it is recommended that &quot; registrars,&quot; namely, those officials who register applicants and submit them for vacancies, should be released once a week for visits to the establishments of employers in their Exchange area. Fourthly, statements of agreed wages&apos; rates notified to the Exchanges should be exhibited in the Exchange building ; and this procedure is apart from, and in addition to, the procedure by which agreements between employers and workpeople may be approved by divisional conferences and through them become binding upon the Exchanges.The committee also make many detailed recommendations with regard to the staff and equipment of the Exchanges, their organisation and routine, and the supervisory and co-ordinating work of the divisional and central headquarters. It should be observed that, in considering their report, they have taken cognisance of those provisions of the Draft Convention concerning Unemployment adopted at Washington. Sir Charles Sykes, in a minority report, records in detail his dissent from the majority report. He states that he cannot &quot; accept the report as it stands, both in respect of its practical proposals, which appear to me to beg the issue, and more particularly of the undue emphasis which it gives to matter? of detail as against the vital principle at issue, viz., public expenditure in relation to value for services rendered.&quot;Unemployment Insurance Act (1920). It will be remembered that at the annual meeting of the National Conference of Friendly Societies held at Coventry on the 23rd and 24th September/^ it was decided to form a central organisation of all friendly and approved societies desirous of administering unemployment insurance, and that the Minister stated in the House of Commons on the 18th November that &quot; provisional approval has been given, subject to the prescribed conditions, to an arrangement under Section 17 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, with the National Association for Unemployment Insurance, which has been constituted by a combination of the National Conference of Friendly Societies, the Association of Approved&apos; Societies, and the Joint Committee of Approved Societies.&quot;f It is now reported, however, that at a meeting held in London on the 26 th November of representatives of the approved societies affiliated to the National Association for Unemployment Insurance, the following resolution was passed, with one dissentient: &quot; That, inasmuch as one of the principal objects of the approved friendly societies in forming the National Association for Unemployment Insurance, was to obviate the necessity for attendance by the public at Labour Exchanges, and as it has now become evident as the result of negotiations with the Ministry of Labour, and from the conditions attaching to the approval of the association, that the Ministry decline to permit the National Association to render unnecessary the connection of its members with such Exchanges (or their attendance thereat) for the purpose of claiming benefit when unemployed a connection which the more thrifty section of the working-class community who constitute the bulk of the members of the association strongly resent it be an instruction to the executive to inform the members that, the association having failed to achieve its purpose in this respect, they propose to return forthwith the whole of the contributions paid, and to dissolve the association.&quot;The general secretary of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows has circularised the lodges of the Order, calling their attention to the resolution, instructing them to cancel all applications for membership of the National Association, and to advise the applicants
(55511.12.20.of the dissolution of the Association and to return in full any contributions paid. Although the official reason for the dissolution of the Association is the compulsory attendance of members claiming benefit at Employment Exchanges, there is ground for believing that the small number of applications for membership received by the Association was also an important factor. This is borne out by a letter from Mr. Cecil Last, secretary of the Bakers and Confectioners&apos; branch of the General Alliance of Friendly Societies, which appeared in the National Association Review for the 3rd December, and in which, after referring to the Employment Exchange difficulty, he admitted that &quot; the number of members the Association had enrolled was unsatisfactory. The Association represented some 31 millions of &apos; health insurers,&apos; and yet only about lj per cent, had enrolled themselves for unemployment insurance.&apos;5Relief of Unemployment (London). The unemployment situation in London continues to attract much attention. During the week bodies of unemployed in various boroughs have seized public buildings and installed themselves in them, pending promises of assistance from the Borough Council. There is now in existence a body called the &quot; London District Council of Unemployed Organisations,&quot; representing, it is stated, over 100,000 men. This organisation was formed at a meeting attended by two delegates from each borough, and it was decided that future policy must be on the lines of &quot; scientific direct action &quot; in order to demonstrate the determination of the men to get relief. The systematic occupation of public buildings is said to be in accordance with the plans of this Council, who are also organising a relief fund, and investigating cases of distress through local committees in the several boroughs.The London members of Parliament met again on the 2nd December at the House of Commons under the chairmanship of Sir William Bull. The Minister attended the meeting, and presented, a statement showing the position of the schemes to provide emergency work which have been approved by the Government. He said that progress was being made with the new arterial road schemes, the schemes of road maintenance and reconditioning, and the acceleration of programmes of work in connection with housing schemes. He also outlined the progress that has been made with relief schemes in the provinces.Cotton Textile Industry: Short Time. It will be remembered that the question of introducing short-time working in spinning mills was discussed by the General Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations last October, and a ballot of members was taken ; but the requisite majority for the adoption of short time was obtained in the Egyptian section only, and not in the American section.^ The question has again been considered with special reference to the American section, and a further ballot has been taken, the result of which was announced at a meeting of the Federation held on 3rd December. As the owners of not.less than 80 per cent, of the spindles concerned have now declared for short-time working, production will be curtailed by 50 per cent., and work will only be done on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in each week; this change dates from the 6th December. In the Egyptian section the stoppage is for 13 hours a week, whereas in the American section t,he stoppage is for 24- hours.With reference to the acute unemployment now existing in this industry, a deputation representing Colne, Burnley, Preston and Nelson met the Minister on the 30th November, and urged the necessity of relaxing the regulations of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, so that the payment of unemployment benefit could begin at once instead of making the applicant produce his book bearing four stamps before he is regarded as entitled to benefit. The Ministers reply was that to accede to the request would be a violation of the Act, but he promised that the question of amending the measure should be brought before the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment.Control of Industry.Railways. The committee appointed by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce to consider the proposals of the Ministry of Transport, as set forth in Command Paper 787, on &quot; the future organisation of transport undertakings in Great Britain and their relation to the State &quot; have recently issued their report. That portion which deals with the question of management is of particular interest at the present time, in view of the speech of Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., at the recent International Congress of Railwaymen, referred to below.
The Ministry proposed that the railways of Great Britain should be formed into a limited number of groups, say, five or six for England and Wales and one for Scotland, and that each group should have a Board of Management composed of representatives (a) of the shareholders, who should form a majority on the Board, and (6) of employees, of whom one-third might be leading administrative officials of the group, to be co-opted by the rest of the Board, and two-thirds members elected from and by the workers on the railways. The committee consider, however, that the management of the railway companies should be vested as at present in Boards of Directors elected by the proprietors, and, in the event of grouping, there should be a Joint Management Committee, elected by and from the Boards of the various railway companies composing the group. The committee are opposed to workers or officials of the railways being placed upon these Boards, unless duly elected by the proprietors in the ordinary way, but consider that it would be advantageous if railway officials and workers on the railways, together with some of the directors, were appointed on Advisory Committees dealing with efficiency and economy in working. They also state that the presence on the Boards of the railway companies of directors other than those elected by the proprietors would increase the difficulties inevitable in raising privately subscribed capital for railway development.As regards railway wages and working conditions, the Ministry proposed the setting up of permanent machinery to deal with these questions on the lines of the existing temporary machinery, namely, a Central Wages Board, consisting of equal numbers of managers and men, with an appeal to a National Wages Board, consisting of four managers, four men, and four users of the railway, with an impartial chairman. The Committee, on the other hand, contend that the establishment of the National Wages Board should be regarded only as a temporary expedient to meet an emergency, and maintain that the economic conditions of the country must ultimately determine the wages and conditions of employment of all workmen. Any permanent machinery which may be provided must not be for the purpose of attempting to circumvent the operation of economic law. They also state that there should be no obligation on either side to refer any dispute to the Tribunal or Wages Board, but when, by agreement, the matter has been so referred, the decision given should be binding on both sides.Industrial and Other Organisations.Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation. Further developments51&apos; in regard to the reconstruction of the Federation are reported. It is now understood that the proposed new Federation, the &quot; General Combination of Ship Constructional and Engineering Workers,&quot; will embrace the Boilermakers and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders&apos; Society, the Constructors and Shipwrights&apos; Association, the Associated Blacksmiths and Ironworkers&apos; Society, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, and two unions ^representing sheet-metal braziers.One of the main objects of the proposed federation is to adjust demarcation disputes. These disputes will, if the local shop stewards are unable to effect a settlement, &quot; be submitted to a committee of three members from both the parties claiming the disputed work.&quot; The chairman is to be chosen from a panel of head teachers or principals of local Technical Colleges, or of draughtsmen, who have no direct concern with the dispute. The chairman or&apos;&quot; referee &quot; will have a casting vote ; and the decision arrived at will be strictly enforced. The governing body of the organisation will be a General Executive Council, consisting of two members from the Executive Committee of each affiliated union &quot; and one additional member for each further 20,000 members or part thereof,&quot; but not more than 5 members from any one union. This body will meet quarterly. A Sub-Executive Council is to be appointed annually from the General Executive Council, consisting of one member from each separate trade affiliated, exclusive of the chairman, vice-chairman and secretary of the Combination.National Federation of Transport Workers. The scheme for the amalgamation of 19 or- more unionsf now affiliated in the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, was fully discussed by a delegate conference of the unions concerned, in London, on the 1st December. At the conclusion, Mr. Bevin issued a statement to the effect that it had been decided to organise area conferences and mass meetings of members in order that the scheme may be thoroughly explained to the rank and file. These meetings were to open at Manchester on the 3rd December. The ballots on the amalgamation scheme will be taken immediately. It is a legal requirement that 50 per cent, of the members of the unions must vote; and* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 21, 20th November, p. 583. t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October, p, 483.
ratification of the scheme depends upon a favourable majority of not less than 20 per cent, of the numbers voting. If any of the unions fail to secure the requisite proportion in favour, they will be obliged to drop out of the scheme, hut the disability will only apply to them individually. In the event of a favourable ballot, another delegate conference will be convened at which the constitution and rules of the new organisation will be adopted. The unions who sent delegates to the conference were the National Union of Dock and Riverside and General Workers, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers, the Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen, the Amalgamated Stevedores&apos; Labour Protection League, the United Order of General Labourers of London, the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union of Great Britain and Ireland, the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry Coal Trimmers&apos; Union, the Mersey River and Canals Watermen&apos;s Association, the North of England Trimmers and Teemers&apos; Association, the Shipping Clerical Staffs Guild, the National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs, the National Union of Ships&apos; Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coal Meters, the United Vehicle Workers, the National Union of Vehicle Workers, the Scottish Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association, and the North of Scotland Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association.A joint conference has been arranged between the Federation and the port employers, to be held on the 8th December, when the scheme for industrial maintenance for dockers which has been put forward by the Federation will be discussed.Trade Union Topics.National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, Machine Ruling and Paper Workers.  The ballot on the amalgamation of the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, and the National Union of Bookbinders and Machine Rulers in this organisation^ has resulted in a heavy vote in favour. The votes of the paper workers were, for amalgamation, 66,077 ; against, 2,104 ; and of the bookbinders, for amalgamation, 16,092 ; against, 2,693. The new union will therefore come into existence on the 1st January, 1921.National Union of Commercial Travellers. Commercial travellers have formed a new union, with an office at St. Bride&apos;s Institute, Bride Lane, E.C. It is understood that the executive council are all members of the United Kingdom Commercial Travellers5 Association.International Relations of Labour.International Congress of Rail/waymen. This Congress was opened at the Memorial Hall, London, on the 29th November, by Mr. Robert Williams in his capacity as president of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, after which Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., took the chair. Great Britain was represented by the full Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen, and delegates were present from Germany, France, Holland, Luxemburg, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Belgium, representing a total of 1,357,000 members.   The Inter-Scandinavian Federation of Enginemen was also represented.It was stated by Mr. Williams that the constitution of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation had been revised since the war, in order to admit of the meeting of sections of the Federation for the discussion of technical conditions, and that the Congress was held as a result of the revised constitution. Mr. J. H. Thomas urged the advantages of international organisation, and stated that the-National Union of Railwaymen intend to hold the Government to their promise that the railwaymen should share in the management of the railways. A resolution was carried affirming the principle of the universal 8-hour day, and deprecating railwaymen undertaking other employment outside working hours.On the second day M. Meltmaker (Holland), put forward a proposal for the appoint-ment of a Commission to inquire into the possibility of international standardisation of railway conditions. The suggestion was deferred at the instance of Mr. J. H. Thomas, who suggested that, in the meanwhile, each country should forward to the Bureau a report on its existing conditions, for tabulation and discussion at the next International Congress.A resolution of protest was passed against the prosecution by the Belgian Government of those of its railwaymen who refused to handle munitions for Poland. The international adoption of a form of automatic coupling was urged by M. Bidegaray (France), but the proposal was stated by Mr. Thomas to be impracticable, on account of the great differences
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Hosiery Operatives (Scotland). The West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association have given notice that &quot; in the interests of the industry, it is absolutely necessary that the advances under the July Award be abolished as from and after the second pay-day in December.&quot; The award referred to is Award No. 422 of the Industrial Court, dated the 30th July, under which advances were granted to time-workers of 8s. a week to men, and 5s. a week to women, and piece-workers received a 15 per cent, increase on prices. The demand for its rescission applies to the whole of the Scottish hosiery trade, excepting that at Ha wick, which is subject to a separate Award, No. 423, of the 30th July. The principal unions affected are the National Union of General Workers, the Workers&apos; Union, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, and the National Federation of Women Workers. A number of firms have posted notices for the termination of contracts of service, on the understanding that re-engagement will follow the terms of any settle-ment which may eventuate.Leather Workers (National). Applications for wage increases were lodged by the National Leather Trades Federation and the National Federation of General Workers on the 3rd December on behalf of their members employed in the tanning and currying trades.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Shipyard Joiners (National).-The strike of shipyard joiners became national in scope by the 4th December. A sub-committee of the executive of the Amalgamated Society to Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners is in continuous session. Members of the General Union of Operative Carpenters and Joiners and of the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association are involved in the dispute. At Manchester, the employers have agreed not to withdraw the 12s. Eight London and twelve Clyde firms are also understood to have agreed to continue present rates of pay. The position in Belfast reflects the politico-economic peculiarities of the situation in Ireland. The recently expelled members of the Belfast district of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners have agreed to accept the proposals for reduction. An understanding, however, is reported with local shipbuilding firms not identified with the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, providing for the postponement of the reduction until Christmas, and the application to Belfast of the terms of any settlement arrived at nationally, that is, in Great Britain.Settlements and Agreements.Boat Builders (Greenock). A dispute between Messrs. Paul Jones, Sons &amp; Co., Greenock, boat builders, and the Boat Builders&apos; Protective Association, over the firm&apos;s proposal for a reduction in piece-prices has been settled, the Association agreeing to accept the firm&apos;s proposal provided that no alteration is made before the present contract is completed, and that the firm conform to any uniform piece-prices which may be established on the Clyde.Commercial Road Transport Workers (London). A weekly bonus of 4s. a week has been granted to commercial road transport workers in the Metropolitan area, consequent upon an agreement between the employers&apos; organisations concerned and the National Union of Vehicle Workers.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department section of the Report, pages 659 to 663.]Features of the Week-Continued.in conditions between the various countries. A resolution was passed, however, urging upon all Governments the necessity of adopting ail possible safety appliances. The General Council of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation were empowered to take &quot; all such measures as may be useful &quot; in helping the railwaymen of Sweden and Norway in their strike. At the conclusion of the proceedings, a telegram was despatched to the Hungarian Government protesting against the sentence of death passed on 10 railwaymen.
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Optical Instruments. The Interim Industrial Eeconstruction Committee met on the 24th November. The report of the Apprenticeship Sub-Committee was adopted, subject to certain reservations. A resolution was passed agreeing to the representation of the National Federation of Women Workers on the Committee. The question of the protec-tion of key industries was discussed, a representative of Messrs. Barr &amp; Stroud, Ltd., addressing the Committee. Two representatives were nominated to attend a conference, to be held on the 8th December, to discuss the possibility of forming an Association of Industrial Councils and Reconstruction Committees.Machine Rivet, Bolt and Nut Trade (Scotland). Advances of 4s. were given by the Industrial Court to male time-workers of 21 years and over, and of 2s. Qd. to female time-workers of 18 years and over. The current percentage advance on piece-prices was increased by 10. Payment of a time-rate to workpeople who are idle as the result of machine breakdowns and similar causes was dealt with. The Court held that the introduction of standard piece-rates is desirable only if work is done under substantially uniform conditions, and, on the evidence submitted, were not satisfied that such uniformity existed.  (Award No. 545.)WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING.Wagon Repairers (Enfield). A proposal that additional wagons should be repaired at the Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfielol, with a view to avoiding further discharges, has been under the consideration of the War Office and the unions concerned. It appeared that although the War Office did not regard the area as suitable for the economic repair of wagons, they were prepared to take steps to carry on the proposed work in order to relieve the serious unemployment in the area. A difficulty arose, however, with the carpenters who were to act as instructors to the semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the factory. An offer made by the War Office that carpenters, acting as charge-hands and instructors, should be given an additional 10s. per week was refused by the All Grades Committee, on the ground that this advance would not bring the rate up to the building trade rate for the. district.By arrangement with the War Office, a representative of the department held a con-ference at the Factory on the 15th November, between representatives of the War Office and representatives of the All Grades Committee, with the result that the following agree-ment was adopted : &quot;The All-Grades Committee, on behalf of the workpeople involved, accept the following provisional agreement: that the payment of the building trade rate for this work is not practicable; that there shall be paid each week to each carpenter 2s. per trainee working under his supervision ; all alterations of rates, outside of those covering engineering establishments, shall be merged into this payment.&quot;It was agreed that not less than five men should be placed under an instructor, and that to take on more than this number would be to the advantage of both parties.Cooperage. A special meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 30th November to consider further the application for wages increases, refused by the employers at the previous meeting. The question was postponed for further discussion at the next meeting, on the 11th January. In order to stabilise the present wages rates, the employers agreed that such rates should remain in. force until the Council meeting in July, 1921, without regard to any reductions in the cost of living within that period. Meanwhile, should any increase take place in the cost of living, beyond the October figure, the Council will be prepared to consider any application for increased wages rates based thereon.
Carpenters and Joiners (Bedford). On a claim for the building trade rate to be paid to carpenters and joiners who had hitherto received the engineering trade advances, the Industrial Court held that the claim., in so far as it related to men wholly or mainly on production, had not been established, but that the district building rate for their trade should be paid to men on maintenance or new constructional work. Engineering trade working conditions should continue to apply.  (Award No. 543.)BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building Trade Rates on Public Works (Cardiff). A strike of labourers engaged on the construction of the Llwyn-on waterworks by the Cardiff Corporation occurred early in November in connection with a demand for the rate of wages applicable to building trade labourers under the South Wales and Monmouthshire area scheme.Considerable difficulty was experienced in inducing the parties to refer the matter to arbitration. The trade union concerned, the National Builders&apos; Labourers, and Con-structional Workers&apos; Society, requested that the matter should be referred to the South Wales and Monmouthshire Building Trade Joint Council, but the Waterworks Committee rejected this proposal on the ground that this body had no jurisdiction as regards the wages payable on public works contracts. The Corporation are affiliated to the Water-works Undertakings Committee, which originated in a conference of local authorities held at Manchester in September. It is understood that this committee has no conciliation machinery, and an arrangement exists whereby disputes can be referred to the Civil Engineering Conciliation Board. The Corporation suggested reference of the matter, through the Waterworks Undertakings Committee, to the Civil Engineering Conciliation Board, but the men refused on the ground that they were not parties to this Board.For some time neither side could be persuaded to move from this position, but the Chief Conciliation Officer suggested the selection of a special panel from each side of the Conciliation Board. The parties agreed that the case should be heard before a panel of seven. When the union representative approached the operatives, however, the men refused to return to work at the old rate pending the settlement. They appear to have been influenced by the fact that two of the strikers&quot; had obtained work as building trade labourers at 2s. Id. per hour. The local branch of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have now intervened in support of the strikers, and have threatened to withdraw their labour from corporation undertakings.FOOD AND DRINK.Employment of Women in Bakeries (Scotland). The main difficulty * which has confronted the Scottish Baking Joint Industrial Council is the definition of pre-war conditions, and on this point an ultimatum has been submitted by the employers&apos; association to the union that, unless the union are willing at once to refer the question to an independent outside authority and are prepared to abide by the decision given, they will withdraw their representatives from the Council.Sugar Refining. On the 30th November, the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee considered a draft Order for welfare provisions throughout the industry, drawn up by the Home Office. It was agreed with a representative of the Home Office that individual employers should send in their objections, if any, and that a representative of the Home Office would discuss such objections after visiting the works in question before the Order was made statutory. A suggestion from the workers that employees throughout the industry should be graded did not find favour with the employers. It was finally left to each employer to talk the matter over with the trade union officials in his own district, and without proceeding on a national basis. An application for an increase of 10s. on all wages was postponed until next January, after a statement had been made by the employers&apos; side showing the very unstable position in which the industry would find itself when control was withdrawn.IRON AND STEEL.Labourers: Iron and Steel Trade (Scotland). The Industrial Court held that a claim that the rates of wages of labourers, other than bricklayers&apos; labourers, should be increased, so as to remove the existent disparity between themselves and the latter class of operatives, had not been established.  (Award No. 544.)
SPELTER AND LEAD MANUFACTURE.Lead Manufacture. The Wages and Hours Sub-Committee of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 30th November. The employers&apos; offer to go to arbitration on the unions&apos; claim for an advance of 15s. per week is still being considered by the executive committees of the unions concerned. A representative of the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union attended to discuss the threatened strike of members of this union in the Manchester area. After discussing the matter with the full Committee, and with the labour side alone, he undertook to recommend his executive to withdraw the strike notices, and to leave the wages question to the Committee. The discussion on the standardisation of wages throughout the industry was carried a farther stage by the employers offering to divide the towns and districts in which the industry is carried on into three grades with minimum rates of Is. 5$d., Is. 4jd and Is. 3%d. for the lowest grade of unskilled labour. The trade union side could not accept this, but undertook to submit counter-proposals, to be discussed on the 13th December. The Women and Young Persons (Employment in Lead Processes) Bill was discussed, and it was decided to send a protest to the Home Office that this Bill had been introduced without any consultation with the Committee.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply Industry. The National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members met on the 4th December to consider further the situation in regard to the threatened withdrawal of the services of the members of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association on the .14th December. It was reported that 101 undertakings had intimated to the Board that they accepted in their entirety the schedules of salaries and conditions of service recommended by the Board, that 69 had given unsatisfactory replies, and that 90 had failed to reply.The Association agreed to suspend, for the present, their notices against the under-takings whose replies were considered satisfactory by the Board, but reserved the right to take whatever action was necessary to ensure a satisfactory settlement, of the whole dispute. It was further agreed that the employers&apos; side should issue immediately a letter to all the other undertakings, urging them to adopt the schedules and conditions in their entirety by the 11th December.  A further meeting of the Board will be held on that date.The position had been complicated by a difficulty which arose at Wimbledon. The Corporation claimed that they had adopted the Board&apos;s schedules and conditions, but they had served notice of dismissal on the members of the technical staff at the generating station because they refused to agree not to carry out the strike instructions of the Association. The Association had passed a resolution that, unless this decision was reversed, they would call out all their members employed in municipal undertakings in Greater London. Representatives of the Corporation and the Association were seen by the Minister on the 1st December, with the result that both parties deferred taking action for the time being.Electricity Supply. Arising out of a threatened strike on the part of employees of the Tretorest Power Company, a special meeting of the South Wales District Council was held on the 30th November. It was agreed that the wages claim, submitted on behalf of the trade union side of the Council in September, be referred to the National Council for determination, both sides, by vote, affirming their willingness to be bound by the decision.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  At a meeting of the District Council for the South Midlands area, on the 3rd December, it was resolved that an increase of one-twelfth upon the wages rates fixed in the grading scheme of the 21st May, 1920, be recommended to all local authorities in the area, and that one forty-eighth of these rates be added to, or deducted from, the actual rate then being paid, for every rise or fall of 5 points, on a three-months&apos; average, in the cost-of-living index number; provided that no automatic reduction be made below the rates agreed on the 21st May. Should the cost-of-living index number fall below 140, these rates will be reconsidered. The immediate increase is payable as from the first pay-day after the 3rd December.The Provincial Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire met on the 3rd December. This meeting followed the withdrawal of the notice of secession from the Council, given by the trade union side at the previous meeting as a result of the refusal of the employers&apos; side either to agree to any advance in wages or to go to arbitration.  Satisfaction at the
resumption of meetings was expressed by both sides, and it was decided to ask the National Council to appoint two members from each side to attend a meeting of the Provincial Council to adjudicate upon the difference.The National Council met on the 3rd December. With regard to the Ministry of Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Council passed a resolution to the effect that, unless written authority could be given by the Ministry of Health to local authorities in respect of their expenses on account of participation in the work of the Joint Industrial Councils, the Council would be unable to continue. The Council amended their previous recommendation as regards overtime, by recommending that double time should continue to be-paid for Sunday and specified public holidays, where work on such days did not form part of the ordinary week&apos;s work, but that such work should be paid for at the rate of time-and-a-half in cases where, although Sunday work was part of the ordinary week&apos;s work, regard had not been paid to this in fixing the rate.The Executive Committee of the Provincial Council for Surrey, Kent and Sussex met on the 30th November, and discussed appeals from Eastbourne, Bexhill, and Ramsgate against the position assigned to them in the grading scheme. It was decided to recommend that Eastbourne should remain in Grade IV, but that Bexhill and Ramsgate should be transferred from Grade Ilia to Grade III.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (Scotland). The Council met on the 30th November. The Municipal Employees&apos; Association were represented for the first time, and their representatives expressed the view that the association should be given more members. The matter was referred to the trade union side. An applica-tion was considered from the National Union of General Workers for an advance of 15s. per week to county roadmen, and for an advance to all employees in the non-trading department of burghs and counties to make the increase over pre-war rates equivalent to the cost-of-living advance granted in the engineering, shipbuilding and other industries. It was decided that the matter should be adjourned until the next meeting, in order that information might be collected as to the rates and amount of advances now being paid.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services ($england and Wales.) At a- conference held on the 26th November, it was resolved that a Provincial Council be formed for the West Riding of Yorkshire, to consist of 24 representatives of local authorities and 24 representatives of staff associations.A conference of representatives of the local authorities in Devon, Dorset and Cornwall and of the staff associations and trade unions concerned, on the 24th November, recom-mended that a Provincial Council be established, and a committee was appointed to draft a constitution.A conference of representatives of the local authorities in Oxfordshire, Buckingham-shire, Berkshire, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight, and of the staff associations and trade unions concerned, was held on the 26th November, to consider the establishment of a Provincial Council for the area. The representatives of the local authorities present decided that they could not come to any decision until the matter had been considered by their respective authorities, and the conference was therefore adjourned.At a conference at Cambridge on the 2nd December, it was resolved to form a District Council for Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedfordshire, Suffolk and the Isle of Ely, consisting of 24 members, 12 on each side. The allocation of seats on the employers&apos; side was determined. For the time being, the whole of the seats on the staff side were allotted to the National Association of Local Government Officers.PROFESSIONAL.Clerks (Scunthorpe). A strike, affecting some 250 clerks, weighmen, and stock-takers, members of the National Union of Clerks, employed at the Frodingham and Appleby Iron and Steel Works, commenced on the 27th November. It is understood that the clerks have been dissatisfied for some months, on account of the delay in dealing with a claim for an advance in wages. It is reported that the employers recently agreed to recognise the National Union of Clerks on the understanding that certain higher grades should not belong to the union, but the clerks refused to accept this qualified recognition. The decision to strike was precipitated by the fact that a clerk had resigned his membership of the union on promotion to be chief wages clerk.Clerks (Hereford).-Th.e Iron, Steel, Tinplate and Kindred Trades Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild have been endeavouring to secure the adoption by the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions of the guild&apos;s scale of salaries in respect of the
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Cigar Committee met to reconsider their previous recommendations with regard to the employment of learners and apprentices in the cigar trade. They adhered to their recommendations with regard to wages for apprentices to hand or mould cigar-making, as well as to the conditions of employment of apprentices to hand or mould cigar-making and cigar sorting and bundling, and agreed* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 611.clerks employed in the Filling Factory and the stores depot at Hereford, and have asked the assistance of the department to obtain a settlement. The department have com-municated informally with the Ministry of Munitions and the War Office, and arranged interviews between an organiser of the guild and the responsible officers concerned.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Insurance Officials. The strike of employees of the General Accident, Fire and Life Corporation continues. On the 30th November, Mr. H. J. Wilson saw the general secretary of the Guild of Insurance Officials, and interviewed him again on the 1st December, with Sir John Gilmour, M.P., who explained to the secretary the lines on which he learned that the Corporation were willing to take part in conversations.Pottery Works Dispute (Barnstaple). The strike at the works of Messrs. OH. Brannan, Ltd.,* has been settled, and work was resumed on the 29th November. The following rates of wages for a 48-hour week have been agreed upon with the union : throwers,  4 11s.; flower pot makers,  3 18s.; slippers,  3 9s. 4d.; labourers,  3 6s.GENERAL.Fair Wages Advisory Committee. The Committee met on the 2nd December to consider a request from the Building Labour Committee for advice as to the course to be adopted relative to the rates of wages paid on housing schemes in rural areas. In the course of the discussion the chairman, Sir David Shackleton, pointed out that, circumstances had altered considerably since the existing Fair Wages Resolution was passed. National organisations of employers and workpeople, through the Conciliation Boards and Joint Industrial Councils, were fixing rates for the whole country under grading schemes, and might grade a particular district at a rate not acceptable to the non-federated employers in the district. The difficulty was not peculiar to the building trade; an example was quoted from the flour milling industry and reference was also made to the printing trade. A further consideration was the fact that the rate paid by small jobbing country firms was often not purely a wages rate, but might include an element of profit owing to the family nature of the business. Moreover, the rate was not sufficient to attract the labour necessary for the Ministry of Health&apos;s housing schemes. It was agreed for the present to leave the Ministry of Health and the Building Labour Committee to determine the rates to be paid, in all the circumstances, in cases such as those indicated in the memorandum.The chairman intimated that he would like to have the views of the contracting departments on this question of the recognition of rates fixed by national machinery, and covering areas where the employers were not affiliated, and stated that he would prepare a memorandum on this matter for consideration.Professor Macdonald referred to the position at Chelmsford, where the local master builders&apos; association had decided that the Chelmsford rates should be paid within a range of 15 miles from Chelmsford, which included rural districts, and also smaller towns for which a different rate had been fixed under the East Anglian grading scheme. The committee were of opinion that the Building Labour Committee ought not to accept a range beyond 5 miles, particularly if the town was graded above the D rates, and that they should at once challenge any such case brought to their notice.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 652 to 658, and 663 to 665.]
General Department-continued.to recommendations with regard to wages to be paid to apprentices to cigar sorting and bundling, and overtime rates for all apprentices. They also made a recommendation that the learnership system at present in operation for learners to hand or mould cigar-making, and the apprenticeship system, should run concurrently for a year.Milk&apos; Distributive Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board resolved to postpone the question whether they should fix special minimum rates for transport workers, or should exclude such workers from the operation of the minimum rates. It was agreed that no action be taken in regard to the re-definition of areas, for the purpose of the application of wages scales, pending a further communication from the Ministry.Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain). The sub-committee on the revision of piece-rates considered further the revision of the general minimum piece-rates fixed, with a view to remedying anomalies which have been revealed.Toy Trade Board (Great Britain). The Special Rates Committee received evidence from five employers and five workers in the branches of the trade engaged in the manu-facture of mechanical, wooden and soft toys. No decision was arrived at in regard to the question of proposing rates for special classes, and it was agreed that, at the chairman&apos;s discretion, no further meeting should be held before the next Board meeting.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board considered the question of varying the existing minimum rates of wages in accordance with a motion, notice of which had been given on behalf of the representatives of workers, and it was agreed that consideration be deferred. A report from the Administrative Committee, dealing with co-operation between Juvenile Advisory Committees and the Board, and with permits of exemption, was received and adopted, and it was agreed that further consideration of the questions of co-operation between Juvenile Advisory Committees and the Board, and of the provision of any special minimum rates of wages for female learners which might be desirable, be referred to the Administrative Committee.The question of the suitable unit of work for out-workers employed in certain branches having been again referred to the Board by the Ministry of Health, it was agreed to adopt the suggestion of the Ministry of Health that the units of work for out-workers employed in the trimming of felt hats be fixed at 25s., and, for out-workers employed in the trimming of straw hats, at 20s.The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Minister on the subject of the granting of permits of exemption for short periods, together with a resolution of the Shoreditch Local Employment Committee. They agreed to recommend that the Board reply to the effect that, while they are fully aware of the desirability of granting permits of exemption for as long as the circumstances warrant, they feel that they must reserve to themselves their rights under the Trade Boards Acts of considering each applica-tion for a permit of exemption on its merits, and of determining the conditions under which such permit shall be granted.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resumed consideration of the minimum rates to be proposed for male and female workers, and resolved to issue a Notice of Proposal to fix minimum rates for female workers, the case of male workers being deferred. The Board again considered a letter from the Ministry on the subject of representatives from metal merchants on the Board, and agreed to ask the Minister to reconsider his decision as to the allocation of one vacancy to an unorganised employer.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 23rd November, confirming minimum rates of wages as varied and fixed for certain classes of male workers, and has specified the 1st December as the date from which these rates shall become effective.For male workers, who have completed four years&apos; apprenticeship or learnership in the trade and who are employed in areas other than those administered by rural district councils or areas, with a population not exceeding 2,000 as returned at the last census, administered by urban district councils or other local authorities, the general minimum time-rate is Is. Id. per hour, and the piece-work basis time-rate 1 s. &amp;\d. per hour.
General Department-continued.The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 30th November, to vary and fix minimum rates of wages for certain classes of male workers.For male workers who have completed four years&apos; apprenticeship or learnership in the trade, and who are employed in areas administered by Rural District Councils, or in areas with a population not exceeding 2,000 as returned at the last census, administered by Urban District Councils or other local authorities, the general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates proposed are Is. 5d. and Is. Q\d. per hour, respectively, to operate for a period of three months, and Is.

Reports for the week mainly reflect a continuance of the state of acute depression in. industry in general, accompanied by widespread unemployment and restricted working hours, which has been marked during the past few weeks, and there is apparently little prospect of any recovery before the end of the year at the earliest.Shipbuilding and Other Industries. In the shipbuilding and allied industries the position has not varied appreciably, but considerable apprehension is felt in shipbuilding districts as to the effect of the joiners&apos; strike. In Scotland the shipbuilding industry is regarded as being in a rather precarious state, with little prospect of immediate improve-ment. Ship-repair work is also in an unfavourable condition, and a similar position is recorded in the reports from the Tyne, Tees and Wear. In the Liverpool district, recovery from the effects of the shipwrights&apos; strike is slow. It is stated that, owing to the pro-longed dispute, many ships which would normally have come to the Mersey for repair have been diverted to the Continent. The position at Swansea and Bute Docks is not regarded as good, but the situation at Barry has slightly improved, more particularly in regard to skilled men. At Newport there is a decided improvement, all yards working at nearly full pressure.From the North-Western Division it is reported that the depression in the cotton trade has extended to the Oldham district, which has hitherto been favourably placed. It is evident that impoverishment now exists among operatives. Although the view is held in some quarters that a revival is not far off, the depression at the moment is very acute. There is an almost total lack of new orders, and manufacturers are apparently experiencing difficulty in keeping their machinery running. The recent fall in the price of raw cotton has still further demoralised the trade in manufactured goods.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, unemployment is stated not to be abnormal in the coal mining, glass-bottle making and earthenware manufacturing
industries at Castleford. Reports from Batley, Dewsbury and Huddersfield indicate that the wool textile trades are experiencing the worst depression known in their history. Though it cannot be said that business is improving in the hosiery trade, it is reported that there is a fair amount of work being done in some of its branches. The position in the boot and shoe trade is becoming very serious. Several firms in the Daventry district have expressed the opinion that they do not consider it possible to continue work much longer, even on a short-time system. A Northampton firm, working on an order for 200,000 pairs of boots for Sweden, are awaiting shipment and financial clearance of the first 10,000 pairs, before proceeding with the remainder.At Sheffield, unemployment in the steel trade is abnormal, owing to the effects of the coal strike, and- the lack of orders. A similar position is reported in regard to the tinplate and steel works in South Wales.In the London area there is practically no demand for unskilled workers, and great depression is particularly noticeable in the house-decorating and the engineering trades, Some 5,000 unskilled workers, however, are being absorbed by the demand of the Post Office for Christmas labour.Industrial Developments. The Tharsis Sulphur &amp; Copper Co., Ltd., Willington Quay, have restarted after twelve months&apos; stoppage.Labour Reductions. The Gramophone Co., Ltd., Hayes, are discharging a large num-ber of workers. At Lowestoft, further discharges have been made by Messrs. Maconochie Bros., Ltd. The Redbourne Hill Iron and Coal Co., Scunthorpe, have discharged over 150 men, owing to the closing down of their coke-oven plant, which they do not expect to restart until after the New Year. At Workington, about 150 men have been thrown out of employment by the closing of a sleeper mill by the United Steel Co., Ltd. Coventry report that the Daimler Co., Ltd., are now discharging men in large numbers. At Bilston, Messrs. John Thompson, Ltd., are dismissing workpeople owing to a shortage of orders.Shortage of Labour. In London the demand for carpenters is easier, but the greatest difficulty is experienced in obtaining bricklayers and plasterers.Shortage of Material. Unemployment is still abnormal in the chain industry at Cradley Heath owing to a shortage of iron.&apos; Engineering employers at Earlestown report that they cannot obtain sufficient iron and steel castings to keep all their machinists in employment. Messrs. Smiths&apos; Dock Co., Ltd., South Bank, in addition to being held up through late deliveries of material, are now experiencing an additional difficulty in regard to obtaining the full electric power supply necessary for their work. At Stoke-on-Trent a shortage of plaster is causing unemployment among mould makers.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation. Reports indicate increasing short time and unemployment, more especially in all the large staple industries. Women&apos;s unemployment insurance books lodged on the 19th November numbered 55,809, compared with 29,703 on the 30th January, 1920. The lowest point in the year was reached on the 25th June, with 20,801 books lodged.Local Reports. The North-Western Division state that the present position and prospects of the textile trade are very bad. The general depression is indicated by the fact that in the Burnley district there are 40,000 looms idle. Throughout the cotton and woollen textile industries, all the main centres report increased under-employment and unemployment. At Dewsbury there is no hope of trade revival before the spring. At Hebden Bridge, unemployment is increasing in the cotton industry. At Liversedge, Morley and Stanningley, all textile workers are on shojt time. At Nottingham the depression is increasing, nearly all factories in the hosiery, lace and making-up trades working short time. The lace trade remains depressed at Beeston, Ilkeston and Long Eaton. At Barnsley, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge, Huddersfield and Todmorden, clothing machinists are on short time.The West Midlands Division report much unemployment, and state that the situation is grave in Birmingham, where many firms are suspending or discharging workers. Increased short time is also reported from Coventry. At Smethwick there are over 1,200 women on the live register, with over 1,000 claims for benefit current.The clothing, hosiery and boot and shoe trades still show marked slackness in the South Midlands and Eastern Division. At Leicester there is no improvement in the hosiery industry, and hosiery workers are unemployed in Loughborough.  At Northampton,Employment and Insurance Department-continued.
depression continues among leather, boot and blouse workers. Boot operatives continue on short time at Wellingborough and Kettering. Messrs. Olivers &amp; Sous, Ltd., jam makers, have discharged nearly 300 girls at Cambridge.Serious unemployment&apos; and heavy registers continue to be reported from London. The Professional Women&apos;s Register draw attention to the number of clerks and adminis-trative workers on their books for whom it is impossible to find employment. In the industrial areas many married women are seeking work owing to the-unemployment of their husbands. The tailoring and needlework trades generally continue slack and all general factory work is depressed. Tottenham, for example, report over 1,000 &quot; live&quot; claims to unemployment insurance benefit.In Scotland considerable short time is reported in the woollen, linen, and hosiery trades.  At Dundee four of the jute mills have adopted a 3-day week.Domestic Service. The industrial depression appears to have had a certain, though not a marked, effect on domestic service, in which the demand for resident domestics still greatly exceeds the supply throughout the country. The majority of applicants are married women with little skill and, owing to their home ties, with limited industrial availability. A large number are seeking to supplement the family income, owing to the unemployment and under-employment of the male members. In the highly industrialised areas the increase in unemployment among women has not led generally to any appreciable increase in the number willing to undertake resident work, nor are private employers showing any great readiness to engage applicants with factory experience only.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Activities of Committees.Employment and Resettlement. Leeds report that, in connection with the Council&apos;s arterial road construction proposals, three schemes involving an expenditure of some  35,000 are to be put in hand, one of which is to be started at an early date and is expected to employ from 300 to 400 men. A similar report, forecasting the early commencement of a special employment scheme, has been received from Rotherham. Newcastle-on-Tyne report that the Council have decided to appoint a special sub-committee to inquire into unemployment in the city. The Lord Mayor thought it desirable that the work of the Employment Committee should be co-ordinated with that of the municipality, and at his request six members of the Committee have been nominated to serve on the sub-committee. Bridgwater have requested the department to impress upon the Minister of Munitions the immediate necessity of an early settlement with regard to a munition dump, which would mean the absorption of some 70 men in brick and tile manufacturing.Ex-Service Men. The Hartlepool Committee are taking up the question of the substitution of discharged men for women employed by the Joint Industrial Dock Com-mittee and the local tramways committee. Rotherham have given consideration to the time-limit for applications for treatment allowance to ex-Service men who developed diseases after discharge from the Forces. Instances were quoted of disabled ex-Service men suffering from tuberculosis who had been refused treatment by medical boards, and had been compelled to seek Poor Law relief. The committee advocate an extension of the time-limit from six months to two years. In view of the prevalent unemplojmient amongst ex-Service men and women, the Dunfermline Committee approached the Town Council and the District Committee, pressing upon -them the urgent necessity of relief work during the winter months. As a result it is expected that in a week or two most of the ex-Service men will be placed in employment. Barry report that no disabled ex-Service men remain on the Exchange register. Peterborough have received a communica-tion from a local firm of brewers stating that, although they have given undertakings under the National Scheme, they are no longer employing the necessary percentage of disabled men; to carry out their obligation they would have to dismiss some of their present staff. The Committee have decided that the firm&apos;s name should be kept on the Roll, in the hope, that at the earliest opportunity, they would engage disabled men to complete their quota. NMiscellaneous. Dumfries have received letters from two of the principal employers in the area intimating that they were highly pleased with the class of applicants sub-mitted by the Employment Exchange, and that all future labour would be engaged through the Exchange. Hackney protest against the establishment of an independent labour bureau by the Borough Council, thus duplicating the work of the Employment Exchange,
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 26th November the Appointments Depart-ment placed 441 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 45,568. Of these, 6,234 have been placed through the agency of the department^ Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 763 ex-Service men and 29 civilians. The number of candidates available for appoint-ments on the 26th November was 11,887 ex-Service men and 1,380 civilians.  At theand suggest that inquiry be made as to whether the cost of such an establishment is a fair charge upon the ratepayers.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to informa-tion received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 25th November, show 291,180 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  228,159 17s. id.Unemployment Insurance Benefit. Payments of unemployment insurance benefit made at local offices during the week ending the .19th November involved an amount of  69,202 4s. 2d.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme.Up to and including the 1st December, 22,753 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 248,445 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller of the South-Western Division reports that, despite the serious effects which the recent miners&apos; strike had upon the work of his division, satis-factory results have been obtained. The live register at the Plymouth Exchange was cleared in an unusual way. The late Mayor of the town, before the expiration of his term of office, had issued a written appeal in connection with the Scheme. Up to the day on which his term of office expired there had been no response to his appeal. He thereupon telephoned the chief employers whom he knew personally in the town, and obtained sufficient vacancies to absorb all the disabled men on the live register.In this division many of the Local Employment Committees have adopted a system wherebv members of the committees &quot; father &quot; certain of the disabled men on the live registers, and interest themselves personally in trying to get them employment. This system produces excellent results.JUVENILE BRANCH.Juvenile Employment Committees.Provision for Unemployed Juveniles. At Camberwell the experiment is being tried of keeping one of the&apos; girls&apos; waiting-rooms specially for girls who have attended regularly at the Exchange. The girls are allowed to bring books or needlework, and to wait from 9 to 12 on the chance of suitable vacancies being notified to the Exchange. By this means it is possible to keep the girls quietly occupied and to ensure that those who have attended regularly have first consideration when vacancies occur. A similar arrangement is being made at the Borough Exchange, where a spare room is being set aside for a special waiting-room for boys. Books and games are provided by members of the Juvenile Advisory Committee, and a member of the Committee is in charge to see that order is maintained.-[References to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 653 to 655, 664 and 671 to 674.]
same date 1,230 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 514 having been registered during the week.Reports from Districts. The Director at Perth reports that there is a marked increase in the number of new applications for employment. A number of applications received by the Officers&apos; Association in Glasgow have been passed to this office to be dealt with. The oldest applicant on the register, a retired Commander, R.N., 65 years of age, has been satisfactorily placed.The Director at Leeds reports that leading employers, particularly in the textile trade, say they have never experienced such complete stagnation for so long a period. Placings for the week ending the 27th November were nearly 100 per cent, higher than those for the previous week, largely owing to propaganda during Obligation Week. The quality of placings is good, several being at salaries over  500 a year and one or two at  800 a year.The Director at Manchester reports thai exceptional interest is being shown in the work in Liverpool by gentlemen not officially connected With the department, and one, an ex-president of the Corn Trade Association, has placed ten candidates in a fortnight. A proposal to develop voluntary help on these lines in the near future has the support of the Lord Mayor.The Controller of the Appointments and Training Branch (Ireland) reports that one trainee, through his association with his training firm, has obtained a position in Colombo at a commencing salary of  900 per annum. Another trainee, in civil engineering, has obtained a good post in India before the completion of his training period.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 26th Novem-ber the Appointments Department received 47 applications for training under this scheme, of which 32 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting can-cellations and withdrawals, 28,249 applications for training of this type have been received in all, and 50,079 for training of the types provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt to date with 27,506 applications, of which 23,077 , have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 21,934 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,106 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 26th November the department received 323 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 575. Of these, 19 have since been cancelled. At the&apos;same date 167 &quot; live &quot; training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 103 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with a total of 927 cases, in 439 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed their training in 234 cases, and abandoned training in 42 ; 140 are still in training, and 23 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 30th November, 24,860 men were in training, as against 24,993 on the 23rd November and 24,943 on the 2nd November. The number of men placed in training during the week was 404. There were 16,751 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 23rd November and the 2nd November being 16,944 and 17,262, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 21,516, the totals for the 23rd November and the 2nd November being 20,979 and 19,486, respectively.An analysis of the most recent complete returns shows that 94 per cent, of the men in training are disabled. The Ministry&apos;s powers of training non-disabled men are limited to the cases of those who, at the time of their joining the Forces, had not, on account of their age, or some similar reason, entered upon an apprenticeship to a skilled trade.   As
n.i2.2a670these men are not at present eligible for training in a special trade, and as disabled men are given a preference in all brades for which they can be trained,- the number of fit men in training remains comparatively small.Of the total number of men in training, 68 per cent., or 17,000, are training for the special trades and under the conditions of the Reports on Openings in Industry. Practically all the fit men are training in the non-special trades and constitute about 16 per cent, of the remaining 8,000.Elementary Teachers.-T\ie Springfield College, Birmingham, will open, early in the New Year, and this will be followed by the opening of another college in the neighbour-hood of Newcastle. In both cases accommodation is proposed for 150 students. Some progress has been made with a fourth scheme, for establishing a training college in one of the Home Counties, with accommodation for 200 men. Men accepted under the Ministry&apos;s schemes will be specially trained to take part in manual instruction and other forms of practical work, and will thus possess qualifications of a particularly valuable order. As the Ministry have now laid plans for training several hundred men, there appears some justification for the idea that these ex-Service teachers may exercise a not inconsiderable influence upon the general trend of educational development.Hostels and Canteens--The Brighton hostels are filling up, and the number of men coming into the diamond works is on the increase. As it seems likely that all the hostels available will very shortly be filled to their utmost capacity, no further steps in the direction of closure will be taken for the present.Government Instructional Factories. Work was started at Shepherds Bush on the 29th November, with 53 men.  A further group of 36 men report on the 6th December.The numbers at Romford have increased from 29 on the 26th October to 110. Other factories in which specially marked progress has been made recently include Bristol, Norwich, Loughborough, Leeds (Whitehall Road), Manchester (City Hall), and Sarisbury Court. In the last-named factory there should shortly be over 500 men in training. This factory has taken over a contract from the Office of Works to build a house for the gas plant; plans for the construction of a bungalow on the estate have been approved, and plans have been submitted for a dairy to he built on the house farm.The Treasury have agreed to sanction the retention of men on the books of the Cardiff Factory for a period beyond the normal course, in order that they may be able to carry out a contract for the erection of six houses for the Cardiff Corporation. The Corporation are to pay  290 in respect of each house, and will provide all the material, plant and supervision, the factory supplying the labour. The work should prove very satisfactory from the point of view of training.National Trade Advisory Committees : Bespoke Tailoring. The Retail Bespoke Tailor-ing Trade Board (Ireland) have decided that they are not prepared for the time being to consider the formation of a training scheme. The Belfast Panel, however, have agreed to train 40 men for the local trade in the Government Instructional Factory, Belfast, in accordance with the scheme for Great Britain ; it is hoped that the Trade Board will issue exemption certificates for the men passed into training, and thus give tacit approval to the scheme.National Trade Advisory Committees : Building. At a meeting of the National Trade Advisory Committee on the 25th November, consideration was given to the general effect of the resolution on the training scheme passed at the annual meeting of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives.* It was pointed out that, in view of the recent decision of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners, to continue with training as soon as the other sections of the trade had absorbed a percentage of trainees equal to that already absorbed by the joiners, it appeared that the primary object of the society in bringing forward the resolution had been defeated, in so far as some of the backward sections had adopted the resolution, and it was therefore impossible for the department to bring up the percentage of trainees in the sections con-cerned. The representative of the Society agreed, and promised that if a communication was sent to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives asking for reconsider a-tion of the resolution, he would endeavour to get it rescinded. The prospect of^ a general re-opening of training in the bricklaying section would therefore appear to be brighter.National Trade Advisory Committees: Engineering.-At a meeting on the 25th November, the Committee considered recommendations made by the engineering* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 9, 28th August, p. 289, ami p. 674 below.
sub-committee in regard to the admission of engineering firms to the King&apos;s National Roll, and the following resolution was passed unanimously : &quot; That the Committee agree that the general percentage of the shipbuilding and engineering trade should be 5 per cent. Many firms, however, owing to the special circumstances of the industry, may be unable to absorb so high a percentage. They therefore desire to urge that Local Employ-men t Committees should be clearly instructed to give careful consideration to each application strictly on its merits, with a view to accepting for the King&apos;s National Roll firms with a lower percentage, where good cause for this can be shown.&quot;The Committee approved of training in engineering at the convalescent centres at Epsom, Blackpool and Birmingham, provided that certain conditions to avoid overlapping were strictly observed.Local Technical Advisory Committees : Vehicle Building. At their inaugural meeting on the 29th November, the Coventry Local Technical Advisory Committee passed a strong resolution in favour of the training scheme, and recommended that the following numbers of men should be trained: bodymakers, 36; coach trimmers, 24; coach painters, 12 ; wheelmakers, 14 ; wood, machinists, 15, to include also the building and furniture workers. The formation of classes in the remaining sections will be dealt with at the next meeting.Women&apos;s Training.Training of Registered Unemployed Women. Interest in training has lately revived, owing chiefly to widespread unemployment. Many women have been out of employ-ment for months, and find that, even for domestic work, training is very desirable. Recommendations on the subject are being received from Women&apos;s Sub-Committees, and it is expected that it will become necessary to set up fresh domestic training classes in some of the large towns.training of War Widows. Notwithstanding the extensive advertisement of the decision that the 15th October was the last date on which war widows might apply for training, applications are being received almost daily. It has been decided that no modifications of the closing date may be permitted, beyond making provision for women who may in the future become widows, as well as for those widows who are ineligible for training until awarded a pension under Articles 11 or 13 of the Royal Warrant. It was considered that it would involve a breach of the State;s obligation if such widows were given no opportunity of applying for training. Application was successfully made to the Treasury for sanction to consider applications, provided they are made within a year of the date of the death of the husband.It has become increasingly difficult to find vacancies for training in home dressmaking in technical institutions. It is proposed, therefore, to set up special classes on a similar basis to those in which registered unemployed women were trained. Treasury sanction has been given for the hiring and equipment of premises, and the appointment of instruc-tors. Wherever possible, the equipment previously supplied for unemployed women&apos;s classes will be used. Sanction has already been given for classes at Blackpool, Ilford, Hammersmith, Bloomsbury and Birmingham. The Ilford class with 16 trainees opened on the 24th November, and the remainder will begin early in 1921. The Bloomsbury class will provide training, not only for the London area, but also for a considerable number of applicants from adjoining areas for whom no local facilities can be arranged.During November decisions have been given in 367 cases. The panel has settled 1,200 cases since its formation in January last. The number of withdrawals still continues heavy. This is partly due to the fact that applications were made with the object of obtaining a money grant rather than training. Requests for grants to buy auto-knitting machines have been particularly numerous, especially from widows in small villages in the Welsh mountains and elsewhere, where there are neither facilities for train-ing nor any prospects of subsequent employment. The Ministry of Pensions have under-taken to give sympathetic consideration to specially deserving cases of this nature, and it is suggested that this department should meet the cost of training in connection with the use of the machines.*Training of Disabled Nurses. During November, .17 applications were received. Only eight of these applicants have been able to state definitely the form of training desired. The physical condition of disabled nurses is usually a determining factor in the choice of career, which is accordingly very limited in scope. The question of health frequently prevents applicants from taking advantage of training vacancies secured with
Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics.--Up to the 1st December, agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 44,962 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,008 apprentices, employed by 17,104 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on the expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 14,233.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance.-An apprentice worked after demobilisation for a few months with Mr. T. Martin, Glasgow, plumber, but was not brought under the scheme, as it had not then been adopted by the master plumbers&apos; association. After the agree-ment of March, 1920, however, the trade union concerned demanded that Mr. Martin should bring the apprentice under the scheme for the period for which he was with him. It is understood, however, that the apprentice was not working at his trade immediately before enlistment, and is therefore ineligible. Further inquiries are being made upon this point. Nevertheless the union insist upon his acceptance, and threaten a strike if the employer refuses. The secretary of the employers&apos; association, and apparently the employer also, seem inclined to give way in order to avoid trouble.&apos; Training in Operation. Local headquarters for the London and South-Eastern area report satisfactory training in all the firms visited recently. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area the hearing of cases by Local Employment Committees is having a favourable influence upon apprentices. Some of them are inclined to act upon the assumption that, as they are under the scheme, their employers must retain them for the currency of their agreements. Proceedings before Local Employment Committees have a salutary influence in counteracting this belief.Unemployment. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands area, the prevailing slackness in most industries has apparently led to an increased interest in the scheme on the part of apprentices. As a result, many inquiries for transfer to other firms and for institutional training are being made by men who have been, or fear that they will be, suspended or dismissed.Institutional Training--In view of the prevailing conditions requests have been put forward for the establishment of special classes for plumbers at Edinburgh and for painters at Aberdeen. The former request came from the employers&apos; association and will be dis-cussed with the operatives. The latter was put forward by the operatives&apos; society. A number of their apprentices have already been suspended; facilities are available for them at the Robert Gordon Technical Institute..General Training.Apprenticeship: Building -Interest in the national scheme is reported to be increasing in the Northern area. A meeting of the master builders/ association, covering Cumberland, Westmorland, and the northern part of Northuraberland, has been con-intervened, and a similar meeting of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives will probably be arranged later. The recent meeting of employers held at Leicester, and attended also by representatives of surrounding towns,.such as Loughborough, proved very favourable to the scheme. Certain features of the scheme are reported to have been anticipated in the locality. The keen interest of employers in technical training is illustrated by large gifts of building materials to the Leicester Technical College. At York some progress has been made, but difficulty is experienced from the employers&apos; strong dislike to any outside interference, and this is shared, to some extent, by the operatives. At Hull, in addition to the wages difficulty, the employers seem somewhat reluctant to admit the operatives to any joint control of appprentices.Apprenticeship : Electrical Contracting (South-West Wales).-The South Wales district of the Electrical Trades Union have recently considered the establishment of schemes of training for their industry, using the national scheme for the building industry as agreat difficulty. Several such cases of this nature have arisen during the month, and training has been postponed indefinitely. Even after commencing training, a considerable proportion break down; in three such cases during the month the nurses have been obliged to withdraw temporarily from training.One nurse has satisfactorily completed a two-months&apos; refresher course in massage, and another, having secured her diploma as dispenser, has obtained a good post.
basis for discussion. On the 8th November a resolution was unanimously passed agreeing the time is opportune for the whole question to be fully considered, and suggesting that the national executive shall take up the matter with the Joint Industrial Council. They further suggested that the Council should secure the co-operation of the Trainini Department. In addition, the district secretary of the union has been instructed to secure a joint conference of the industry in South-West Wales to consider the question and, if possible, to form an Apprenticeship Committee.The representative of the National Federated Electrical Association, who is also president of the District Joint Council of the industry for South Wales, appears desirous that his association shall co-operate in any movement for the regulation of training. He favours a joint conference, and the establishment of Apprenticeship Committees on lines similar to those of the building scheme. It appears, indeed, that the employers are apprehensive of the control of training passing to the workpeople.Apprenticeship : Farriery. Local headquarters - for the West Midlands refer in particular to the attitude of employers towards technical knowledge, and the need for proper treatment of the horse&apos;s foot. Many employers consider that only practical training is necessary. The need even for good practical workmanship is not always realised. It is to be feared, therefore, that many owners do not trust their horses to the farrier with any confidence. The industry as a whole, however, appears to be alive to the importance of training, in the West Midlands as in other areas.The supply, both of apprentices and skilled labour, appears to be falling short even of the decreasing demand of the industry. As regards apprentices, the industry suffers, not only from a shortage of entrants, but from much wastage among those who are appren-ticed. It requires boys of special physique and qualities, with no fear of animals; its conditions are often unpleasant and, in some districts at any rate, accidents are common, while the wages both of boys and journeymen are often low. In country districts, where there are no competing industries, the dearth is nothing like so great. On the other hand, some large towns depend almost entirely upon the rural areas for their skilled labour.Welfare Work (Wales). A large scheme has been initiated by the Tredegar Coal and Iron Co.; another scheme is about to be launched by a Llanidloes firm; and a welfare supervisor has been appointed in an important copper works at Swansea. At Cross Hands a welfare council has been formed, both the local colliery company and the miners being anxious to inaugurate a scheme; the Llanelly tinplate firms are considering pro-posals for a joint educational and recreation scheme; and developments are also in progress at Briton Ferry.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 668 and 674.]
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested.Ex-Service Men : Unemployment.Mr. Mills asked the Minister of Labour the number of wholly disabled, partially disabled, or fit ex-Service men now unemployed; and whether the possibility of poultry farming on a territorial basis has been considered as a partial solution of this problem, having regard to the large number of eggs of doubtful quality now on sale.Sir M. Barlow: The total number of able-bodied ex-Service men in Great Britain, registered as unemployed on the 12th November, 1920, was 20.3,479. Including Ireland, the figure was 220,935.The total number of wholly disabled or partially disabled ex-Service men registered as unemployed in Great Britain on the same date was 15,384. Including Ireland the figure was 18,881.These figures all relate to men on the live registers of the Employment Exchanges, but I realise that a margin must be added for men unemployed but not registered.It is not clear what is meant by the expression &quot; territorial basis.&quot; I would refer my hon. friend to the Ministry of Agriculture regarding this point. (29th November.)Ex Service Men : Training.Captain Terrell asked the Minister of Labour if he will state the trades in which difficulties have still not yet been surmounted to permit of the adequate training of ex-Service men ; and if he will in each case specify the reasons for such difficulties.Sir M. Barlow: As regards the training of disabled ex-Service men, the various Local Technical Advisory Committees have naturally, in consequence of the industrial depression, recently exercised a greater reluctance than hitherto in agreeing the numbers to be admitted to training. This is based upon ultimate prospects of employment. The Building Trades Federation, indeed, have informed us that, so far as they are concerned, they cannot agree that any further disabled men can be admitted to training as from the 30th September last. In view, however, of the serious shortage of skilled labour in these trades and the urgent need for a greatly expanded building effort, we cannot accept this, and negotiations with a view to removing the embargo are now in progress. As regards the training of fit men, in pursuance of a decision of the Cabinet, we are approaching employers and employed in connection with three industries foundry trades, iron puddlers, and railway wagon building. Further, negotiations are in progress, as my hon. and gallant friend is aware, in connection with proposals very largely to augment the number of men engaged in housing operations, and, as my right hon. friend the Minister of Labour told the House last week, those negotiations will be brought to a conclusion at the earliest date.  (29$ November.)Captain 0&apos;Grady asked the Minister of Labour whether his attention has been drawn to the case of Private Inman Phillips, No. 235,455,8th Yorkshire Regiment, now residing in Leeds, who has received notice to leave the Leeds technical schools instructional work-shops without being found work ; whether, in view of the promise made by the Minister to a deputation of Members of Parliament that the Ministry had power to increase the period of training.by 25 per cent., and that this power would be used fully; and that the Ministry would, if necessary, get powers for a further period of training so long as the existing depression in trade continued, which made it difficult for them to place men, he will say what steps, if any, have been taken to ensure its fulfilment.Dr. Mucnamara: I will inquire into the case to which my hon. and gallant friend refers, and inform him of the result. I would add, however, that instructions have been issued dining the past few days that no men, for whom improvership vacancies cannot be found, shall be discharged from any training centre for the time being. (1st December.)
