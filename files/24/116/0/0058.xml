IATiorsiw3^^^I pnAL KE mtp. fiRGAyiSAT IOK^ Mote by the British Delegation on Assembly Dccument 14, (previous paper ]*o. b.p.D. -52*.)COWaSSlON JfoReference to Assembly Document 14 (Health Organisation) . also 2.0/43/D9 (itOlations between the Technical Organisationand the League ., circulated by the British Delegation for the information ofMembers c,f No. 2 Commission. ,1.   There is at present an international Health Body represent-ing a large number of countries and having a definite official standing under the Rome Convention of 1907, with offices ana staff im paris.2.   &quot;when the Treaty of Versailles was framed, and international health questions were brought within the responsibility of the League of Nations, the -wise course was taken of providing for the retention of the Office international, acting under the League as part of its new organisation..   This arrangement has been the basis of all the discussions and resolutions whi^h have since taken place, and is embodied in the official documents at every stage. The scheme as adopted by the council at san Sebastian,, and Assembly Document uo* 14, gives full recognition to the .^reat importance of preserving the existing Office international, retaining its paris premises and doing nothing to nrejudioe its present staff. The principles     of conservation have rightly been applied to the fullest possible extent.3,   what is thus conserved, however, is only a portion of what the T,eajue requires.   The Assembly of Public Health Officials and experts, meeting for one or two weekt) twice a year, the issue of monthly bulletin, and other work done by the Paris office, are all most valuable.   The League also requires., however, -active day-to-day work, including intelligence work en epidemics, and international prevention of disease *111 needs active o-ommunication with the Health Departments of different countries, on tbe measures taken to give effect to international agreements on health, matters, and to collect and present public health information, disease statistics,  etc., in comparable form.   It.needs on the spot a competent public health adviser and staff, not only for the above purposes but for daily communication with the Health section of the Labour Crganisatien, with the League of Red cross Societies, and to advise the Council and the secretariat on the many questions relating to Health which oome before them.
4,   if the office international d&apos;Hygiene publique were aa/.ed to undertake these additional functions, it would have to revolutionise its practice, its offices, its staff and its statutes.   These are matters in v/hich it has no traditions, no experience and a quite insufficient personnel.   In fact the parin organisation is not contrived and worked for the purposes of an executive tody.5.   The effice spends at the present time a very small sum, and the amount to be levied is strictly limited by the Convention of Rome.   For the purposes of the league a muoh l-r*er expen&amp;i-ture would   be wan tea, ana if the Leo- %e is finding the money for work essentially outside the experience of the Office inter-national, it is entitled to demand efficiency ana to require a measure of control.6.   The necessity of a Geneva office on the oxouno of efficiency can hardly &quot;be questioned-.   The Paris office consists of a lar.?e meeting room, with a library, rooms for Director and Assistant Director and for the rditor of the Bulletin.   It is merely rented and there is no room for extension.   The pireotor, it is under-stood, was formerly an official in the Ten oh Ffcrei ?n office, and is now approaching th*  a&apos;-:e of retire-, ent; the Medical, id rector, while of Tea: distinction as an epidemic-legist, is also a verfber of the -leno.te, devoting a lar ;e part of his ti..e, with the assent of the office international, to political wont.7.   if, therefore, the office international were to be entrusted with the new duties, it would have to be-in by creatin;; a new staff, as well as a new office - a process which would hopelessly dislocate the vf ry valuable wor .;e and. traditions which it has in its present sphere.The Lea ue requires its new health organisation to deal&apos; efisctively and rapidly with international health questions.At the moment, for example, the following practical questions are ripe for settl ernent: -(1) international notification of epidemic diseases;(2) International a^reem/-nt to treat venereal disease among sailors gratuitously and by modern methoas at all the ohief ports.(3) international agreement as to the form and terms in which deaths should be certified; and(4) international a.*rei me-nt to secure that rats are examined for plague at the principal ports ant the results publisher ; also that ever&quot;&apos; ship should have its rats killed every six months or less9,  questions of still wider scope- will soon arise.   The Offioe-international oa   at most give.an expression of opinion on., such matters,   it has no other means of influencing Govern-ments.   It is not the business of anyone to press these opinions on the consideration of the Governments.   The delegates may or may not do so,   frequently they have no instructions from their Governments on the subject and this position has to.be accepted.
10. To meet thia the scheme provices a permanent Committee which will meet frequently, organise the wor.. ana. hrinjj it to fruition, give direction to the j edioal Secretary and head-quarters staff, ana deoiae on a definite programme of work for the General committee, i.e,, the Office International.   This procedure is taken from the league itself (with seme mcidifioa-tiens in favour of the office Internationa,!) and there are obvious) advantages in its conferring to the general model anc being subject to the general rules laid down for technical organisations.Soth&quot; Hovember. 192Q.Whitehall Qar.ens, S.w. 8th Deoember, 1.: 2f) .
