Hio L;&quot;ib.u: r: i&apos; : jT\,&apos;/&apos;;; C      mm; it. * Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.-SECgET.a g      telegram from Viceroy, Bonne Department, to Secretary of State,dated 5th December 1920.Following is weekly telegram :-&apos;; -Interest centres mainly in (1) attitude of students to non-co-operation; and (2) elections. Details of (1) sent in Education Department telegram, and we only cite Leaders estimate of effect of Gandhi&apos;s visit to Benares : &quot; Visit, not produced cataclysm. According to present information not many students are prepared to follow him into wilderness. We would be surprised if even 5 or 6 per cent, leave it. None,&apos; so far, actually left it.&quot; Paper congratulates Maiaviya, professors, and especially students, on resisting Gandhi&apos;s appeals. A strike amongst students of Engineering College, Benares, lias also collapsed, the students recognising their mistake and apologising to Principal. At Allahabad, where 2,000 students were addressed by Gandhi, Professor Jevons made speech on other side, and (? only) 30 or 40 students signified adherence to non-co-operation in response to Gandhi&apos;s invitation. t2. Elections.-Much attention has been devoted in Press to elections, numbers recording votes varying greatly from some 8 per cent, in Bombay to 60 per cent, in Lucknow, where contest very keen reported to be brisk in Allahabad, fair in Benares, and varying from 52 to 48 per cent, in Madras. In Central Provinces, Chief Commissioner called for fresh nominations for seven non-Mohamedan constituencies owing to absence of candidates. Dadabhoy and Khaparcle (? reported omitted) to be elected by large majorities to Council oc State. Extremists have made great * efforts to frustrate elections by putting up men of straw in some places, by threatening social boycott, and by rowdyism and hooliganism at polls. In Lahore difficulties of candidates are (? represented as serious owing to determined efforts of extremists, but reports of the polling, so far as seen, indicate fair proportion voted. Jhansi (United Provinces), where Ghintamivni elected to United Provinces Council, been scene of feverish activity on the part of non-co-operators, who gave out that Gandhi instructed his followers to oppose Ohintamani and vote for his opponent. Gandhi, to whom Chintamani wired, denied this. Later, at Benares, he urged excommunication of those who took part in the elections.In Madras reported bonds of students with non-co-operation posters paraded streets, attempted to offer organised resistance, but not apparently with much success. Mrs. Besant issued manifesto calling on all national Home Rule Leagues and Liberals and.moderates to vote for each other&apos;s candidates in all elections, as being parties standing for reform against revolution, co-operation against non-co-operation, for freedom against tyranny, for congresses 1885 to 1918 (Bombay) against new congresses of (Delhi) to 1920.3. Gandhi has been touring United Provinces, and Wedgewoocl has issued manifesto. Former at Allahabad declared Government established in India to be satanic, urged boycott of schools and colleges, and admitted his non-success with students, denouncing their failure to keep their promises - of withdrawal from institutes ; from Bombay reports of his recent tour in that Presidency indicate his disappointment at the poor success attending his schools campaign, in spite of establishment in various places of national Schools and Colleges, Wedgewood&apos;s -manifesto encourages movement for Swarij, but expresses disapproval of non-co-operation, especially refusal to seek election to Councils, though attaching blame for movement rather to &quot; 0&apos;Dwyer &quot; school and extremists of bureaucracy than to Indian extremists. Points out risks and dangers of non-co-operation, which is campaign of hate, and involves coersion of Indians who co-operate ; urges definite time limit for Home Rule, formation of territorial army, and with companionship based on these conditions, co-operation with Government, and asks Nagpur Congress to put forward suggestion for conference on these lines under Presidentship of Prince of Wales.4. Lajpat Rai is taking an increasingly prominent part in public agitation. To-day&apos;s Press telegrams announce that he will preside over All-India College Students&apos; Conference at Nagpur in Christmas week, also that he will preside over All-India Railwaymen&apos;s Conference ,at Bombay on 14th January to 16th January, which will be inauguration of central organisation to improve condition of railwaymen all over India.-2890     100  12.20 ......
5. Punjab. Apart from schools and elections, emphasis laid on establishment of Panchayats to take place of ordinary courts and boycott of recruitment for Army service in Mesopotamia and foreign goods. Rural population appears little affected, but in parts Jullundur Division, where number of returned emigrants of doubtful loyalty, situation regarded with some anxiety. Application of Seditious Meetings Act reported to have had markedly good effect in districts where applied, steps being taken to serve notices under Defence of India Rules against two prominent Sikh, agitators, and to prosecute another. Lieutenant-Governor has toured through Mohamedandistricts of Attock, Mianwali, Dera Ghazi kharre and MuzzaiTargarh, and was received everywhere with spontaneous expressions of loyalty and no dissentient note. Sardar Mangal Singh, editor of the Akali, convicted yesterday at Lahore, under sections 124(a) and 153, Indian Penal Code, for series of seditious articles on non-co-operation, and sentenced to three years&apos; rigorous imprisonment, and fine of Rs. 1,000.United Provinces. Politicians active, but Gandhi, as stated above, unsuccessful at Benares, and no action now to be taken till, meeting of Court, about middle of December. Attempts being made to spread non-co-operation among villages, but, in opinion of officers touring in districts, shallow and unreal, and people know nothing about it and do not care. General feeling that Gandhi and party have lost influence through campaigns against schools. Racial feeling is still strong, and non-co-operation is ardently pushed by independent newspaper, Allahabad, which is effectively countered by Leader. At Aligarh meeting, attended by 125 gentlemen from different parts of Province, under presidency of Nawab Muzammilullah. unanimously passed resolution establishing reform league with view., to co-operation with Government in political and educational matters and to start propaganda immediately. Raza Ali, long time member of United Provinces Legislative Council, congratulates trustees Aligarh in long letter. Says Ali Brothers will soon realise blunder of enlisting narrow-minded Moulvis, and asks students to have nothing to do with pretentious impostors and humbug.Bengal. Signs of friction between Bengal agitators. Movement for boycott of schools, though spreading to Ohittagong and Tipperah, appears to be spent, and situation improving. Strikes continue, most serious being strike at iron works at Kulti, which, first reported to be of political significance, has just been settled, and strike in liowrah mills, at Avhich looting reported and some Europeans stoned. European Association again offending Indian sentiment by announcing intention of having memorial to General Dyer, suitably (? word omitted) and forwarded to him.Bihar and Orissa. Agitation in schools and colleges to persuade&apos;&apos; -students withdraw, vigorous, but movement has received very little support from parents and guardians. Gandhi now making extensive tour in province, wdiere he has consider-able personal influence on account of Champaran connection.Delhi. Reported to be none the worse for fortnight of almost ceaseless oratory. Ulema&apos;s conference not much of success, but resolution enjoining non-co-operation, especially in military matters, to issue as fatwa, signed by all Ulema present. These, however, are mainly local men, whose names do not carry any great weight. Political conference, presided over by Mahomed Ali, admitted failure. At Zenana meeting British Government characterised by Gandhi, Shaukat Ali and Kitchlew as devilish and fiendish, and contributions raised in shape of ornaments. National schools make little headway, and other schools unaffected. Khilafat receipts, bearing partial resemblance to rupee notes, sold in Delhi to face value over four thousand rupees. Dr. Ansari elected president of forthcoming session of &quot; All-India Moslem League &quot; at Nagpur. Maulana Mahmud at Hasan of Deeband died on 30th November at Delhi, ,where he came to preside over Ulema&apos;s conference. Late news from North-West Frontier Province that political situation, which deteriorated owing to Wedgewood&apos;s visit, is now quiet again.Burma. Swami Shradanand touring and preaching non-co-operation, with probable result of strengthening anti-Government feeling among Indians.Two Burman newspapers warned, under section 153(a), Indian Penal Code, for publishing seditious articles. Newspaper reports as to fate of &quot; Burma Reforms Scheme &quot; led to the accentuated expression of impatience. One paper suggests it will not be enough even if Burma gets Indian scheme. Khilafat rupee receipts in wide circulation may lead to ignorant people being deceived, but Law Officers advise no case for prosecution under auy section of Penal Code.General. Political situation continues to be easier, and outlook generally improved.
