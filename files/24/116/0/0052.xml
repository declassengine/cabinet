INTERPRETATION OP ARTICLE 405 OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES.MEMORANDUM BY SIR MALCOLM DELEVINGNE,The question raised by the Minister of Labour in his memorandum to the Cabinet of 17th November (0tP.2115) as to thfl interpretation of Article 405 in Part XIII (Labour) of the Treaty of Versailles is a very serious one.The question, shortly, is whether, in the case of a draft convention adopted by an International Labour Oonferenoe which the Government do not wish to ratify,, they are required by Article 405 to submit the draft Convention to Parliament for its decision, or whothor they may reject it on their own authority.This is the first time I believe that any doubt has been raised as to the obligation of the Government under the Treaty to submit such a    . Convention to Parliament. . The Treaty has been universally understood as imposing an obligation on tho Executive Government of any country to consult its legislative body (exoept possibly in cases where effect could be given to a convention by administrative action without amendment of the law*); and there is no doubt this was the intention of the Labour Commission of the Peace Conference in Paris whioh prepared the.scheme, and of the British Delegation to the Conference who put forward the scheme in the first instance in the Commission,The Scheme as originally put forward by the British Delegation went indeed considerably further,,   It provided that &quot;Bach of the High   -Contracting Parties undertakes that it will within the period of one year from the meeting of the Conference communicate its formal ratification of the Convention to&apos; the Director, and will forthwith take all steps necessary to put the Convention into operation, unless such convention is disapproved by its legislature&quot;.Commenting on this proposal, the Commission in their report to thei iPeace Conference Bay that it - &quot;implied an obligation on every State to submit any draft convention approved by the Conference to its national legislature within one year, whether its own Government representatives had voted in favour of its, adoption or not.&apos;  This provision was inspired by the belief that, although the time had not yet come when anything in tho nature of an international legislature whose decisions should bo binding on the different States was possible, yet it was essential for tho progress of inter national labour legislation to require the Governments to give their national legislatures tho opportunity of expressing their opinion on the measures favoured by a two-thirds majority of the Labour conference&quot;,The provision underwent considerable modification in the Commission with a view to meeting the difficulties caused by the Constitution of the United States, including the substitution of the phrase &quot;authority or*Even in these 0u3es.it seems better to submit the Convention to Parlinnent as onoe ratified tho Convention binds the country for tho period stated in the Convention and Parliament may wish to be consulted before the Government undertakes suoh an obligation.
authorities&apos;, within whose oorapetenoe the matter lies&quot; for &quot;legislature&quot; -but the Committee certainly had no intention of weakening generally the obligation on the Governments to consult their Parliaments,   This was ihe via media adopted by the Commission between the old method of concluding international conventions by diplomatic negotiation, Bubjeot to ratifioa-tion by the Exeoutive Government, and the extreme proposal urged by the advanoed members of the Labour Commission for making the International Labour Oonferenoe a Super-Parliament whose resolutions wore to be binding on all the States which were members.   Under the British proposals as aooepted by the Labour Commission; the final decision whether a convention was to be adopted or not was to rest with the individual State, but it was to be the decision of Parliament or whatever other national authority possessed the powers of dealing with the subject matter of the Convention. This procedure was always regarded as one of the most important features of the scheme for the International Labour Organisation,,   It was hoped that by obliging the Governments to bring the matter before their representative assemblies for public discussion&apos;the pressure of public opinion could be brought to bear on reactionary or backward Governments to adopt the Conventions.It is clear that if a Government can, under the Treaty, itself reject a draft convention we are really back at the old state of things and the pro-visions of,-Article. 405 are rendered, futile *In his Supplementary Report of 7th February last to the Cabinet on the Washington Conference (CAP, 595), Mr. Barnes who was the Senior British Delegate in the Labour Commission, makes it quite clear that in his view the Treaty requires the submission of Conventions, where the matters dealt with are such as would require legislation, to Parliament.The matter is one which raises very- grave issues.   If the British Government which was so largely responsible for the adoption of the scheme in Part XIII were now to question its obligations under Artisle 405, we should expose ourselves to extremely hostile criticism both at home and abroad, and we should be dealing a blow to the Labour Organisation which might have disastrous results.   Other Governments would not be slow in following our example? the authority of the Organisation would crumble away and the moderate elements of labour which are now supporting the Organisation would be driven over to the extremer seotions.&apos; I suggest that it is most important both for our own credit arid in the interests of the work of the International Labour Organisation that the Maternity Convention should be&apos; submitted to Parliament before the end of the present&apos; session.:--(SIGNED) MALCOLM DELEBIBGNE,
