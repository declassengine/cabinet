1[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet-   December 11)20.SECRET. C.P.-2214.pi -CABINET.OUR AMERICAN DEBT. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.WE have just received through a1 private, but authoritative, source an account of the attitude of the American Government on the subject of the British debt. It is am insistent restatement, without modification, of the position always taken by the United&apos; States Treasury.Shortly stated, that position is 1. That, under the law as it stands, the United States Government has no power to remit debt without Congressional sanction, and that neither Congress nor American public opinion will give that sanction now. or are ever likely to give it.2. That the United States Government, has no power to postpone interest on the debt, except as part of an arrangement for the conversion of our demands obligations into obligations having a fixed date of maturity.3. That the long delay in funding our demand obligations &quot; is already embarrassing the [United States] Treasury, which will find itself compelled to begin to collect back and current interest if speedy progress is not made with the funding.&quot;4. That if the funding is done at once, it &quot;will do more to strengthen the friendly relations between America and Great Britain than any other course of dealing, with the same &quot;;, that if, on the other hand, it, is not done at once, then &quot; in the present state of opinion here, there is likely to&apos;- develop an unfortunate misunderstanding.&quot;The statement concludes with an eminently characteristic paragraph which may be intended to convey a threat and is carefully worded so as, to. convey no shadow of a promise.I have twice brought this question of our debt to America before the Cabinet, and they know the anxiety with which I view our position.The American Government is entitled to call for payment of the whole debt at any moment if it chooses, just as we are entitled to call upon France or Italy. But to do this would be both clearly contrary to the understanding on both sides when the debt was contracted and an absurdity of which I think the United States Government incapable, and, since it would be universally recognised as an absurdity and incapable of fulfilment, uon-cpmpliaiice would do us no harm.But the case in regard to interest is different. The United States Treasury is bound by law to demand interest unless we fund our obligations or Congress releases us from them. I believe that President Wilson is right in saying that neither Congress nor public opinion will allow of such a releaseWe, on the other hand, are bound by our own undertaking, printed on the face of the certificates of our debt, to convert these certificates into 5 per cent, gold bonds &quot; if requested by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America.&quot;4What, then, is to happen? If we do nothing, the United States Treasury will be obliged for its own protection, in face of a hostile Congress, to call upon us to pay* The words on the certificate are : &quot; This certificate will be converted by the Government of the United Kingdom, if requested by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America, at par, with an adjustment of interest into an equal par amount of 5 per cent, convertible gold bonds,&quot; &amp;c.[5037]
up back interest from the 31st May, 1919. Such a demand, unlike a demand for the repayment of the capital of the debt, is not a manifest impossibility. On the contrary, it is a demand with which it is possible for us to comply. Moreover, it is a demand which will not have been made until we have refuse!) or failed to carry out the much less onerous obligation to convert which we undertook when contracting the debt.To refuse in such conditions would seem to me not only most damaging to our credit but scarcely compatible with our honour.But although it would be possible to pay the interest due amounting on the lf)th November to 314,583,000 dollars* the payment of so large a sum would seriously cripple our resources. We should be obliged to ship gold in large quantities, and as a consequence publicly to notify the suspension of specie payments and the inconvertibility of our currency. It is difficult, and perhaps impossible, to say what the effect on our internal and external credit positions would be. 1 believe myself that it would be little short of disastrous, for it would still remain the fact that we had failed to redeem our promise to convert when  requested by the United States Treasury.1 cannot contemplate such a position Math equanimity, either in its effects on Anglo-American relations or on our financial credit I am unwilling to repeat proposals which President Wilson again refuses in language which I find it difficult to stomach. The American Government and people are living in a different continent I mi^ht say in a different world. It is useless and worse than useless to criticise their insularity, blindness and selfishness, and it is not compatible with our dignity to appear as suitors pressing for a consideration which is not willingly given.America insists that we should fund or pay. In my opinion, confirmed and strengthened by all that has passed since I first brought the matter before the Cabinet, there is only one thing for us to do. Since America will be no party to any general scheme for the remission, total or partial, of inter-Allied&apos; debt, I recommend that we inform the American Government through Sir Auckland Geddes that the British Government is prepared to resume the negotiations for the funding of the British obligations and will send a representative to Washington for the purpose.I further recommend that we should accept an arrangement on the general lines proposed by Mr. Ilathbone on behalf of the United States Treasury, but that it be an essential condition of any arrangement by which we give bonds that these bonds continue to be held by the United States Treasury during their currency. This condition may be refused, for Mr. Harding is reported to have spoken of marketing our bonds to pay off United States internal debt. In that case the Cabinet must roconsider the position. It would, I think, be premature to decide now what our action should be in that contingency.(Initialled) A. C.Treasury, S.W.,November 30, 1920.* At 8&quot;fi0 to tiie   =  89,881,000.
