iPQOUMENT IS THIS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABIHBT.THE ELECTRICAL POV/BR ENGINEERS1 DISPUTE * Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. 19.I think my colleagues ought to know the present position of the dispute between the Bleotrioity Supply Under-takings and the Eleotrioal Power Engineers1 Association.   There is a National Joint Board, whioh is a form of Whitley Council, dealing with (mainly) the wages and conditions of servioe of power engineers employed by Bleotrioity Supply undertakings.   In May last, after very lengthy negotiations, this Board agreed a schedule of salaries and conditions of servioe for power engineers. Copies of the schedule were sent to the various Undertakings throughout the country with the reoommendation that it should be put into operation.   Some few of the Undertakings oomplled, but the great majority have not dono so.   Further meetings of the Joint Board have recently taken place but without much result.   The E.P*E.A. then on November 12th sent out notices to all Undertakings that unless the schedule was oompliod with by November 87th they would withdraw the servioes of tho whole of their members by November 30th.   They wore enpowored to take this action by a ballot of their Association in whioh 84 per cent, of their members voted in favour of this oourbd.   As a result of a special meeting of the Joint Board held on November 13th, these dates have been altered to 11th and 14th Deoember respectively. The joint Board has addressed a letter to eaoh of the Undertakings recommending that the schedule be adopted in its entirety and asking for tt reply before Deoembor 4th when a joint mooting of the Joint Board is being held.   On the result of this meeting deponds the/attitude
attitude of the E.P.E.A.. in striking or continuing work.I do not think that there is now any possibility of a stoppage before Deoember 14th.   The Wimbledon Corporation had given notice of discharge to their power engineers in view of the letter of November 12th, at whioh they were incensed since they had oomplied with the eoheduie.   I have, however, secured that neither they nor the E.P.3UA. will take any action at Wimbledon until after the meeting of the Joint Board on Deoember 4th.The Electrical trades Union have discussed their position with the E.P.E.A., and it may be that, should the E.P.E.A. deoide to strike, the B.T.$. will not only not &quot;blackleg&quot; them but may strike in sympathy,Needless to say, the Ministry of Labour will do all in its power to avert a stoppage in the event of a failure on the part of the joint Board at its meeting on December 4th, but I am anxious that my colleagues should know the exact position at this date.(Jntld.) T.J.M.Ministry of Labour, December 2nd, 1920.
