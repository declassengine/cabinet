EXPENDITURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE.

MEMORANDUM BY SIR M. DELEVINGNE.

I submit the following observations on the points raised in the memorandum which has been circulated to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer C.P.2170 so far as regards the expenditure of the International Labour Office.

1. Though the Council of the League of Nations has no control over the Budget of the Labour Office, the Assembly of the members of the League can in the last resort exercise a check on extravagance by refusing to vote the funds and as the Assembly is to meet yearly and will have the budget of the Labour Office before it, this should in practice be a very effective check. The whole question of the expenditure of the League is now being considered at Geneva by one of the Commissions of the Assembly and the Director of the Labour Office has appeared before the Commission and given evidence. The Commission are making a keen investigation - and whatever decision the Assembly arrives at, the Labour Organisation will have to comply with. It does not seem however that an individual Government has the power under the Treaty of saying that in the event of any action being taken by the Labour Organisation of which it disapproves it will not be responsible for any part of the expense, as suggested in (f) of the Chancellor&apos;s proposals. The signatories to the Treaty have undertaken by Article 6 to bear the expenses of the League in certain proportions. It may perhaps be pointed out that the British share of an expenditure for the Labour Office of £350,000 would amount to less than £20,000.

The Governments are also in a position to exercise an influence in the direction of economy through their representatives (who number one-half of the total representatives) at the Annual Labour Conference by voting against impracticable and extravagant schemes.

2. The functions of the Labour 0ffice are determined in the main by express provisions in the Treaty of Peace(Article 396), and the bulk of the expenditure will be incurred in connection with the duties specifically mentioned in that Article viz :- the preparation for the Annual Labour Conferences; the collection and distribution of information, and the publication of a periodical paper dealing with problems of industry and employment of international interest.

The personality of the Director has not affected the expenditure so far in more than an inconsiderable degree. M. Thomas is an energetic man and has large views of the functions of the Office - but it cannot fairly be said that he had been responsible for any extravagant schemes. Of the three biggest inquiries which the Office has so far undertaken, one, the inquiry into industrial conditions in Soviet Russia, was proposed by the representative of the Polish Government, and was approved by the Council of the League and by our own Government; the second, the Emigration inquiry was directed by the First Labour Conference on the
Initiation of the Italian- delegationi   the third;, the inquiry into Production, (referred to.in the Chancellor&apos;b memorandum), was proposed by the employers&apos; group on the Governing Body.   The DireotorfB Boheme for the last inquiry is a very comprehensive one. but the expenditure has not yet been passed by the Governing Body (it will come up for consideration in January),, and in the mean-time the scheme is being considered by the Government Departments&apos; concerned.  The object in view however is not to institute fresh investigations, but to collect and collate existing material.&apos;7 Where the National Governments are doing this or are willing to do it, the Labour Offioe will not duplicate the work.v, ... - .3.    The expenditure of the Offioe must be judged with reference&apos; to the importance of the work,   If the Offioe is successful in the objeot for which the Labour Organisation was Created last year&apos;at Paris, viz- of allaying labour unrest and stemming the progress of the extreme communist movement, the sum mentioned seems a very small price for the several States to pay.    I would refer to the remarks on pp. 4 and 9 of the report which X submitted to&apos; the Cabinet in October last.    The following is another instance of the valuable part whioh the Organisation is&apos; Capable of playing.    At the Genoa &apos; Labour Conference last June, the different parties were unable to come to an agreement on the limitation of the hours of work on board ship&apos;.  Subsequently, the International Federation of the Seamen&apos;b Unions met, and&apos;discussed the action to be taken.  A strong&quot;movement declared itself in favour of an international strike, but it Was decided in the first instance to ask the Director of the Labour Offioe to intervene. &apos; AS a result of his intervention a Conference has now been arranged to consider the subject further, over which, at the request of both parties, the Director will preside.   If these negotiations are successful, the value of the service whioh the   , . Office will have rendered can hardly be overestimated.4.    I can say from close personal acquaintance that the Office Is : not, being, run on extravagant lines.   The salaries necessarily had to approximate to the scales sanctioned for the officials ,of the League,, but  even so they are not excessiye having regard to the expatriation involved    and the very high cost of living at Geneva. - Ab a matter of fact the, scales have not been sufficient in a number of oases to attract men of. the calibre, desired.    It has to be remembered, that the Office only came into existenoe at the beginning of,,the. year and has had to be built up hurriedly in order to cooperate with the work whioh -immediately devolved upon it under the Treaty of Peace. &apos; Some &apos; ** mistakes have been made as was inevitable in the oirbu^stances but they are hot many.&apos;   The Budget for 1931 is now being very minutely examined by the members &apos;cf the Finance Committee with a view to&apos;: framing it on the moai eooriomio&amp;l lines possible5*   ,1 do not think there, is much.risk, of an unhtply alliance betweenu\
the Director and M.. Fontaine in regard to schemes of extravagant expenditure.    When I saw the latter the other day, I found him taking a very conservative view on the subject of expenditure, and other Government representatives on the Governing Body are doing the same.6.    The question of the direotion and control of the work arising in connection with the International Labour Organisation, to whioh the Chanoellor refers at the commencement of Part II of his note, has been dealt with in another memorandum.(Signed) MALCOLM DELEVINGNE.TlU 43-46
