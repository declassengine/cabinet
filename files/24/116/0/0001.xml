R A L I A.&apos;Tli 8 Secretary of SA.ate for fixe Colonies received a telegram on 16th November from the Governor-General of Australia In regard to the proposed meetings o&quot; the Admirals of the China, East Indies and Australian stations.   The Commonwealth government-ment, it said, surest or?, that the first meeting should be held about .larch nest in Melbourne, and invited the Conoanders-in-Chief of the East Indies and China stations to be the guests of the Co. nonwealth for that meeting.   It was considered that the business to bo discussed would deal largely with the resources o;&quot; Australia, and it would be better if first-hand particulars&quot;were obtained in Australia; further, during the last Tev/ years much information regarding the Pacific, which would be of great use to the conference, had been collected by the Navy Office at Melbourne.FINLANDThe Finnish Ministry of war- has drawn&apos;up a Naval Prpgra:i&apos;.ia for defence purposes.   Proposals are to build4 destroyers of 1,500 tons each.8 torpedo boats of 800 tons each.4 submarines, displacement 600 tons each and parertship o:? 700 tons. 6 gunboats of 600 tons each. 13 motor boats of 13/2 tons each. 1 fuel transport of 700 tons.For the defence of the shores of Lake Ladoga, Paijanne and Saimaa to build 6 gunboats of 340 tons each.The estimated cost of fie above projrra me is 560 million ftriks.   The programme is to be spread ever 6 years split up into two periods of 3 years&apos; each.   It has been proposed to include 65 million fmks. in the extraordinary expenses for 1920. This expenditure has not yet been approved by the Diet,- of whom 40/3 of the members are Socialists and determined to oppose any expenditure that aims at strengthening the military power of the country.The Council of the League of Nations at Brussels approved of the following maximum composition of the Finnish Navy.6 Torpedo boats4 Police gunboats on about 1,000 tons. 1 4 Submarines of not more than 400 tons.A request has been received from the Finnish Government through the Foreign Office to purchase the following war vessels.1 Destroyer of 1,500 tons. 1 Torpedo boat of 800 tons. 1 Submarine of   750/900 tons.This request is now under consideration.SOVIET   BUSSIA.The British Baltic Force is about to be reduced to one I -At Cruiser and two destroyers.

IIGERMANY.In the opinion of the President of the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control the rate of progress in the carrying out of the terms of the naval clauses of the Treaty &quot;by the German authorities is generally satisfactory. Large stocks of naval v/ar material have been concealed and oontinue to be discovered.       Constant pressure has to be maintained to enable progress to be made.   Paxticular reluctance is shown in the delivery of plans and documents relating to naval war material under Article 209 of the Treaty.POLAND.Four Polish Naval Officers are Joining the Navigation School at Portsmouth on the 30th November.   They will be drafted to ships shortly for instruction.RUHANI A.Negotiations betv/een the British and Rumanian Governments for the re-organisation of the Rumanian Navy by the purchase of certain of E.&apos;l*Ships and the despatch of a  , British Naval $fission have broken down awing to the inability of Rumania to meet the expense involved.   Negotiations, however, are now in progress aimed at an agreement based on a reduced mission without sale of ships.   This agreement will also probably include the reception of a limited number of Rumanian naval officers for instruction in our training establishments.F R A N 0 H*Rear-Admiral A. F. C. Laugier, lately in command of the Atlantic School Division, has been appointed Oomnander-in-Chief , Algeria.    Rear-Admiral C L.

india the Column operating against the V/ana Waziris have reached Sarwakai, they encountered no opposition, except slifliit sniping, and have suffered no casualties.EGYPT.In the absence of any declaration of British policy Egyptians in the Sudan are actively engaged in secret pro-paganda amongst the Sudanese.MESOPOTAMIA.The general situation is satisfactory and the rebellious movement of the Arabs is everywhere collapsing.P S R S I A,North West Persia.   Our troops are reported to be advancing&quot; towards ftesht and are in a position eleven miles south of that place.   Slight opposition on the part of the Bolsheviks *ras encountered but they have been driven back by our advanced patrols.   Bolshevik casualties included Russians amongst the killed.Our ItLnister in Teheran reports that the recent air attack on Enzeli and the present operations being con-ducted by General Ironside, will go far to restore confidence in our power and will help to defend Persia against invasion.SOVIET   RUSSIA.Repatriated British Officers and Men, (military), arrived at Harwich on November 22nd.   one party of civilians will leave Helsingfors on November 27th and a second party on December 4th.Russia, Internal Conditions.   Reports of the downfall of the Soviet Government being imminent are now reported to be inaccurate and also that mutinies in the Red Army are much exaggerated.   Riots have broken out in the Red Army due to bad food., lack of clothing and especially to the incredibly severe discipline, but all were quelled by most severe methods. Disturbances amongst the peasant population of 15 districts are reported but these were promptly suppressed.   The Govern-ment dreads the coming winter and are endeavouring to find some remedy for lack of food and fuel, especially in Moscow and Petrograd.      Reliable Reports from Norway, state the Soviet Government is preparing for war on a considerable scale, and a renewed attack, on Poland and also towards India, is anticipated.Lithuania.   Lithuanians and Zeligovski agreed to a cessation of hostilities on November 21st.PART   II.     GENERAL   INTELLIGENCE.
G E R MANYThe German Government has in the main carried out the military clauses of the Peace Treaty.The only real violations of the military clauses of the Treaty are1.      The failure to disband and disarm the Orgesch and the &quot;Bavarian and Y/u&amp;temberg Einwohnerwehr on.2.      The failure to disarm the civil population.3.      The export of war material.In case of (1 and 2) the German Government is not strong enou$i to carry them out, thou^ the disarmament of the civil population secured surprisingly good results. ... As regards    ; only minor German officials are implicated. -I Jj A L Y.A military convention was concluded at Rapallo between Italy and Jugo-Slavia directed against Austria or Hungary in the event of the return of a Hapsburg to the throne of either of those two countries.The President of the Council has stated, however, that this agreement was limited to a declaration that the two Governments would refuse diplomatic or moral support to any proposal involving the return of the Hapsburgs to Vienna or Budapest.It is reported that the Rapallo negotiations have caused very bitter feeling among Italian Naval officers.JUGQ   SLAVIA.The Jugo^-Slav Government has ratified the Treaty of Rapallo.   When the exchange of ratifications has taken place it is understood that the Jugo-Slav Government will expect the Italian Government to execute the Treaty immediately, and if d!Annunzio!s troops do not evacuate the &quot;territory assigned to Jugo-Slavia it is possible that the latter may use force to eject them.SOUTH   RUSSIA.British Hi $1&apos; Corani s si oner, Constantinople, reports that more than *120,000 refugees from the Crimea have now-arrived at Constantinople, and some 15,000 more are still expected from Kertoh.   These have &quot;been living since the evacuation in unspeakable conditions, from which it is feared grave epidemics may at any time result.The French are endeavouring to the best of their means to transport as many refugoes as possible to Lemnos, Gadlipoli, Bulgaria and Serbia.   30,0.00 have already been shipped to various destinations.The French have applied to take over from the British the refugee Camp at Lemnos, and this proposal has been approved by H..vl.Government.
JUGO   island VIA     (Contd.)The Italian Ambassador in Paris has asked the French Government to delay the evacuation of Cattaro until the Treaty of Rapallo is ratified, and this request has been conceded.G R g g 0 5.- The plebiscite to determine the succession to the Greek throne has been postponed to the 5th December.lie Princes Andrew and Christopher, brothers of the ex-King Constantine, arrived in Athens on 24th November, and were received with much enthusiasm.M.Venizelos says that the Treaty of Sevres must be saved at all costs. He would prefer the abdication of King Constantine and the accession of Prince George, but if this is impossible he hopes that the Allies will recognise King Constantine on the condition that he binds himself to carry out the treaty.Reports from the Smyrna area are not good, and show much unsteadiness among the Greek troops.Gen. Papoulas has sent the following telegram to King Constantine: &quot;The Smyrna army under my ooitmand expresses to you its loyalty and devotion and under your command waits to win further victories&quot;.   He states that he has received orders from the provisional government to continue Asia Minor operations.TURKEY.Sir Horace Rumbold, the new Hi$i Commissioner for Turkey calls further attention to Italian pro-Kemalist intrigue.   He instances the preferential treatment to Italian ships trading in Black Sea ports.Lieutenant General Sir Charles Harrington, K.C.B., D.S.O. has succeeded General Sir george P. 2&amp;Llne, G.C.M*G., K.C.B., D.S.O. qs General Officer Co:mnanding-in-Chief Army of Black Sea.The Allied Hinh Commissioners have insisted on the early ratification of the Peace Treaty.Mustapha Kemal has expressed his willingness to receive a mission from the Constantinople government, and it is expected that the latter government vail make use of this fact to postpone ratification.&apos; A R M S N I. A.  -A second armistice was concluded on November 18th between the Armenians and the Nationalist Turks.The Armenians are faced with the necessity of accepting peace with either the Bolsheviks or the Kemalists, and have asked the British Government which of these two alternatives would be the more acceptable to the latter., and if H.M.Govern-ment will agree to being represented officially at the negotia-tions.   H.m.Goverament has replied that it cannot be a party
PORTUGALThe coalition Cabinet formed by Sena or Alvardo de Castro has been compelled to resign owing to a hostile vote in the Chamber by Combined Liberal and Democratic Parties,-SPAINSpanish Operations at Sheshouan.      It is becoming Increasingly evTSeHTthat&apos; the&quot; Spanish operations, which had as their object the encirclement of the mountain-ous district to the N.W. of Sheshouan by converging columns from Tetuan and Larache, have been far from successful It has been officially announced from Madrid that operations have bean terminated for this year and although Sheshouan is now occupied by Spanish troops from Tetuan, the Larache column, now falling back on its base, is by no means in an enviable position; snow is falling in the mountains and the communications of both Spanish columns are constantly &quot; being attacked.CHINA.The following factors are rendering a continuation of a strict embargo on the supply of Arms to China increas-ingly difficult -(a) I ..ly is lukewarm, and in effect does not restrain her subjects from supplying arms.(b) Chang Tso Lin has seized most of the Vickers . ,   &quot;      aeroplanes at Peking supplied to the ChineseGovernment under contract.   Although Chang cannot use them, his action has weakened the British contention that they are for &quot;commercial&quot; purposes only.(o)      American aeroplanes have been supplied to theSouth, and American machinery for the Canton Arsenal. America inclines to cease restraining her subjects from supplying aircraft for 11 commercial1&apos; use*(d)      Japan states that if other nations supply armsshe cannot continue to restrain her own people from doing the same.   Japan&apos;s objections appear principally to be caused by Italian action.   She is not in the least dec&amp;ved by the 11 commercial11 nature of the Vickers Contract, but she is not&apos;a competitor in the aeroplane trade.A R M 5 N I A      (Contd.)to any treaty with the Nationalists, &quot;but realise that the Armenians have no option but to make peace with the Turks as being preferable to an agreement with the Bolsheviks.
