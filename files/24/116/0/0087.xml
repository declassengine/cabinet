V   V    &quot;     * this Doc!......r&apos;&quot;v&quot;V&apos;i Pv^fifty ofCABINETANCILLARY POOD SERVICES.Memorandum by the Food Controller.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;  The advancement to the close of the current financialyear of the date at which the Ministry of Pood as such will come to an   end makes it important to come to an early decision regarding the functions to be continued after thatdate, so that a consistent policy of administration may befollowed in the next few months.   The question is renderedstill more acute by the necessity of submitting forthwith to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury some sort of estimate for the next financial year, and I have been asked to obtainthe decision of the Cabinet as to the maintenance of certainancillary services which have been undertaken either by theirdirection or at the request of other Departments of State.These are, briefly, as follows(1) The maintenance of an Emergency and Road Transport Organisation in skeleton form throughout the country, controlled by a nucleus headquarters staff in touch with food supplies. -(2) The Returns of the principal stocks of foodstuffs in the country,.which I understand are required by the Committee of Imperial Defence; and the Returns v   , relating to Supplies of Home-killed Meat (Slaughter House Returns) which are furnished to the Ministry of Agriculture.*(3) The administration of the Las Palmas Agreement, if this is continued, and the provision of Refrigerated Tonnage for       output from the factory.(4) The retention of the Orders affecting Liquor Prices and Description, and of an organisation for Enforce-ment,(5) A Catering Service for the Royal Parks during the summer season,(6) The Licensing of Slaughterhouses and the Registra-tion of Retailers in cases where such registration is required by the Ministry of Health,3213
322I will deal with each point - in more detailEMERGENCY ORGANISATION.The Supply and Transport Committee considered last week aMemorandum, of the 1st December, in which reference was made tothe forthcoming end of the Ministry (then contemplated forAugust 31st 1921) and to my desire to have Emergency machinery in good working order if it were to be maintained for whatever Govern-ment Department might have to administer it.   I mentioned that thecost of such an organisation would, be about  85,000 a year, whichwould cover the cost of both headquarters and provincial staffs.Thia figure represents an insurance premium of  2 per annum forevery thousand of the population.   The Committee agreednthat if the Government decided that it was desirable to retain an organisation for supplying the necessities of life to the country, it was essential that a nucleus organisation such    as that described by the Pood Con-troller should be continued In existence, either under the Pood Controller or whatever Minister might here-after be placed in control of the Ministry of FoocU&quot;1 would only add this:-&apos;(l) The obligation of the Government to maintain food supplies in time of emergency, previously implied,has, under the Emergency Powers Act, become almostan express undertaking,(2) The Divisional and Road Transport Organisations are the &quot;king pin&quot; of any emergency food supply, and it would be wholly impossible to improvise an effect-ive organisation.(3) Provincial Organisations^however   complete, are in themselves useless unless they are controlled by a headquarters staff in close touch with the food supply and distribution tradeSv   It cannot be too clearly emphasised that in the making of emergency arrangements the problem to be met is that of working out (in conjunction with the trades) a supply programme which emergency transport can fulfil .
323 I(4) The existing organisation is not resented by Labour, During the railway strike it received active assistance, The moderate Labour Leaders keenly desire its contin-continuance, and I was impressed by a remark of Mss dynes&apos;, the other day, to the effect that the known Government preparations for an emergency service were mainly instrumental in preventing the coal strike from becoming a general strike and possibly developing into something worse,   In my view future conflicts will be prevented only in so far as the organisation of the Government is stronger than that of its opponents,STATISTICAL RETURNS* The maintenance of theso Returns, even If extended, as in my opinion, they should be expended, so as to embrace.a continuous survey of tho food supplies of the United-Kingdom from all sources would only require a staff of 15 subordinate and 2 responsible officers, The lack of any accurate information as to the food position was acutely I felt at the outbreak of war* and it is for this reason that the Committee of Imperial Defence desire a continuance of this work,LAS PALMAS AGREEMENT,    . The Las Palmas Works of the British and Argentine. Meat Company^ (Limited, have been operated,on behalf of the British Government, since-the Autumn of 1915,   The Agreement expired at tho end of 1919, but operations have continued upon terms provisionally agreed with the company which it is proposed to incorporate, in a formal Agreement,   This kroemont will involve participation by the Government for.a period of pars in the South American Meat Trade.   The work at present devolving bon the Ministry of Pood under the Agreement consists in allocating the luantity of meat required by the fighting services? the remainder of the leat, constituting the bulk of the output, is sold by the British and argentine Meat Company, on account of the Government,   Tho administrative fork involved is the supervision of the works and disposal:of accounts, lie main difficulty however, in connection with the extension of this fgreement if the Government no longer exercise control over Refrigerated jonnage will be the provision by the Government of refrigerated ships to ping home the meat.
LIQUOR PRICES AND DESCRIPTION. 324The considerable volume of administration which has devolved on my Department resulted from the necessity in 1917 of concerted measures for the ooonomic use of grain.   The enforcement of these Orders is responsible for two-thirds of the inspection and prosecution work of my Department, and would naturally absorb a greater proportion after the 31st March, when I propose to revoke all Orders except such as relate to the sale of foodstuffs by weight, the misdescription of goods, the regulation of quality, and possibly the Order regulating the price of imported meat. The total cost of enforcement for the month of November was  4,950, and the amount recovered in fines was  2,950,   I am advised that the Beer (Prices and Description) Order/could be safely revoked if gravity restrictions were abolished.   So far as Spirits are concerned, the difficulty lies in the fact that the holders of stock are able to get 40s Od, a proof gallon for export, whereas they can only sell to the home trade at 16s, 8d,   Conversely, the export demand at so high a price Is limited, and the stocks of mature and immature spirits are more considerable than can be retained for an indefinite period.     At some time in 1921 the Spirits (Prices and Description) Order can be withdrawn, but It is difficult at the present moment to specify the precise date.PARKS   CATERING   SERVICE,At the request of the Office of Works, the National Kitchens Branch of this Department arranged last year to undertake catering for the Royal Parka, and an expenditure of  10,000 on plant and equipment was effected.   Their net profits last year and this amounted to two-thirds of the capital expenditure, and it is de-sired that the service should be continued next year, so that at the end of three years the plant and equipment could be handed back, to the Office of Works wholly free from debt,LICENSING OP SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND REGISTRATION OF RETAILERS.The system of licensing slaughter houses forms the basis for obtaining returns of the consumption of home-killed meat. Moreover we have promised not to dispense with slaughter-house licensing without consulting the Ministry of Health.   I under-
325Mrarxl that thfi same JDepartjme-rrt -is considering- the hygienic and sanitary- conditions tinder which meat is handled and sold.   In so far as meat is concerned, the retailers are themselves desirous of maintaining a system of registration,.   There is much to be said for the continued registration of both wholesale and retail milk dealers until the Ministry of Health obtain the necessary statutory powers; other-wise I do not propose to continue the registration of retailers in respect of other commodities.   As the registers for meat and milk are actually in being, there is only the nominal cost of maintenance and re-vision, the work of inspection being performed by local author-, ities.   If the registers were abolished it would be a costly process to revive them.I desire the direction of the Cabinet as to which of the services outlined above should be maintained.   In so far as it is decided to continue them, I am anxious that the staff required for their performance should be transferred to the same Department of State as will be responsible for the final liquidation of the Ministry.   This is necessary on grounds both of efficiency and economy, the former because my liquidation work involves constant reference to persons with administrative knowledge, the latter because the staff engaged in liauidation could, in times of emergency, be transferred, as it has been transferred before, to emergency work.   In short, I think it essential to transfer the machine as a whole, and I ask the Cabinet to give this decision, and further to intimate   what Minister shall become responsible for concluding the liquidation of my Department.(signed) Charles A,mcCurdy,14.12,20.
