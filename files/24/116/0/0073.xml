It is far from having touched the bottom, and, if we may judge by the present temper of the men, serious disturbances are only a matter of time.   A small proportion of the unemployed are unemployable, but the great majority are men who will not accept charity and are drifting from despair to desperation.   As conditions become worse&apos; they listen more readily to the doctrines of class war and compare-their lot with that of the employers. -The seizure of the buildings in London is an evil example       \ which can scarcely fail to spread to tho Provinces,   Agitators are straining every nerve to exploit the discontent and are even advocating open robbery whenever they can do so with impunity. On the other hand, the recent prosecutions for seditious speeches have had a good effeot.a Communist &quot;Unity11 Conference will be held in Manchester on December 11th.   To judge from present appearanoes, it will be an exhibition of disunion.   Lenin has again given instructions regarding the tactics to be adopted by British Communists.So far, there has been no settlement of the electricians and tramwiy disputes, and the railwaymen are said to be growing restive about the scheme for oontrol of &quot;the railways.There have boon no further Sinn Pein outrages in England or Scotland during tho week; in Scotland an important capture of explosives has be on made.There has be on no improvement in Ireland.   In fact, the numberof recorded outrages has increased by 20 per cent, but there is a growing won-riuetw of outrage ami murder, due more to economic than to moral cause3,   Tho Economic; situation i&apos;&amp; deplorable,   Though the papers have been full of overtures for a settlement, it is clear that these are individual efforts which bind nobody but the person who makes them.
uTOffLOYMSNTThe gravest matter at the moment is unemployment, which is rapidly increasing.   The latest available figures*show that 520,151 are drawing benefits, while the grand total of unemployment is between 750,000 and 800,000; 18,782 disabled and 227,5^1 non-disabled ex-Service mon are included in these figures.   Besides those, tens of thousands of work-people are on short time, the cotton, hosiery and boot and shoe trades being principally affected.   In the American section of ttie cotton industry it is proposed to close the mills on Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays and to work only eight hours on the remaining days.   This will mean a total reduction of about 50 per cent, and with all this the bottom-has not been reached, for notice has, been given to some 27,000 Welsh tin plate workers to cease work at the end of the month owing to slack trade.   In business circles it is believed that the slump is only beginning and that Luring the winter very large numbers of work people wili have to be discharged.My correspondents report that the temper of the men is becoming increasingly bitter and in Manchester a repetition of the London seizures is anticipated.   There is much muttering about the ostentation and luxury of the &quot;idle rich&quot; and agitators have seized upon the real discontent and distress to carry on a ceaseless propaganda of class war. Peace with Russia as a panacea for unemployment is their constant theme.The problem is even more serious in London, for here something akin to mob law has already begun.   The following is a list of the big buildings seized, as given in a recent issue of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;:
Battersea - House in Meyrick RoadCamberwe11 - Public BathsCamberwell - Public LibraryCamberwell - Three housesLalston - House, later taken by police.East Earn - Three houses.Edmonton -  own HallFinsbury - Public LibraryFulham - Public LibraryHackney - Houso in Richmond RoadHackney..- Territorials&apos; Drill HallHigh Wycombe    BarracksIslington - Public LibraryLewisham - House in High RoadManor Park - HousePeokham - House attached to breweryPoplar - Town HallReigato - Reigato HouseSouthwark - Y/ansey Street HallTottenham - Town HallWalthamstow - Public BathsWalthamstow - Public LibraryThe driving forces behind these seizures, infaioh are apparently worked on a definite plan, are believed to be the Communist Parties and the Herald League, for the latter has a very close liaison with the National Union of Ex-Service Men. A certain group of Islington extremists is going from district &quot;to district, inciting ex-Service men and unemployed to seise halls and houses.   Arthur Siffleet told my correspondent that the unemployment question was to he the means of bringing about the revolution, and the first steps were to obtain arms and ammunition.   It is doubtful, however, whether the men have any quantity of serviceable arms, although the men who have seized the Lecture Hall of the Fulham Library were reported to have both arms and ammunition.   This building was vacated on Decombor 4th owing to the lights having been cut off. Steps are being taken to safeguard arms and ammunition stored in Territorial and other drill halls. *The real danger of the position is that the unemployedmay be induced, as they were in Germany, to act upon the maxim&quot;Nothing will be done for you until you unite and seise all the food shops,, clothing shops, factories and warehouses and convert the contents to your own uses.&quot;it/    f
It must bo rememborod,that as a result of the War the   j working classes generally have become accustomed to better conditions of life than in former times when unemployment has been acute, and consequently they resent it more*   They are, moreover, accustomed to act under discipline.The problem is, unfortunately, insoluble, for it is brought about by world-wide conditions over which we have no control, but naturally to the mind of the unemployed this fact is unknown, and the Government alone is to blame.UHITY AMONG COMMUNISTSThe negotiations for a united Communist Party are notrunning smoothly.   On November 28th the Welsh Communist groupheld a secret meeting at Cory Hall, Cardiff, and afterdiscussing the question at great length decided that&quot;This conference, representing South WalesT revolutionary element, can only,attain unity by having local autonomy in given local area.&quot;   and&quot;That the Secretary write both Communist parties asking why the South Wales Comrades &quot;have not been invited to sit on the unity executive at Manchester.&quot;,   The ^districts represented at,this Conference were Merthyr,Dow lalev Cardiff,. Tonyrefail,. Porth and District, Peuriweaber,Hardy,- Femdale, Ogmore Yale, Port Talbot, Ahercynon, endBarry;-A..B. Cook, J. Warren and Chappel were present asfraternal delegates froco the Communist&apos;Party of Great Britain:- &apos; ... * &apos;      14   i- 1 i i.iS ,     *   i - &apos;. f       i &apos;* &apos; r *&quot;\ &apos;*   &apos;      *l&apos; lT* &apos;      - H &apos;    -       . -f   *     *   . i   t   r&apos;   *(*--.* &apos;* it **&quot; 1**1Sden Paul and B.B..Offell represented the Pankhurst group, the treasurer of which, ,T.J* Catkins., was nominated to the chair.In the Midlands prospects of unity do not appear to be any brighter; even in Coventry, where special efforts have been made, relations cannot be described as amicable; on December-2nd. the communists were ,all owed the&apos; use of the: &apos;\ r&apos;    - Socialist/
Socialist labour Party rooms, &quot;but had to stop their meetingat the end of the first half hour owing to the cold andwere informed that if they came again they must- bTing* their -own--coal.In Glasgow the struggle has degenerated into an open fight to make a livelihood out of the workers1 contributions. The Communist Labour Party, the Scottish Communist League, the Glasgow Communist Group and the Communist Party of Great Britain are all in the arena and their followers are beginning to suspect that something is wrong. \[John McLean, whose ambition at the moment is to.becomechief of a United Communist Party of Scotland as a first stepto the Presidency of the Scottish Soviet Republic, insists,in the current issue of &quot;The Vanguard&quot; that &quot;we in Scotlandmust not let ourselves play second fiddle to any organisation with headquarters in London.&quot;  He does not mince his words:&quot;William Gallacher is going the rounds ridiculing the idea of a Scottish&apos; Communist Party because he has been to Russia and poses as the gramophone of Lenin. Nothing in point 17 precludes the formation of a Scottish Party as Scotland is a definite country.   The exercise of a little honest thinking will demonstrate that.   Now, Soottish Marxians are surely not going to accept as an authority on Marxism a man such as Gallacher who never was a Marxian, but an openly avowed Anarchist.   Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviki were and are very rigid Marxians.   Because of their faithful adherence to principles they have won through and are holding out with amazing success.&quot;A real revolutionary party can only be established here on Marx, not on Bakunin, by fully avowed Marxians of long years of standing.   If Lenin tells us to unite with elements who are Anarchist, we must reply by asking the Bolsheviks to unite with the Uensheviks or the Social Eeyolutionariesc   We stand for the Marxian method applied to British conditions.   The less Russians interfere in the internal affairs of other countries at this juncture, the better for the cause of Revolution in those countries.&quot;To ask me to work with Malone for revolution is a joke.   A man like that ought not to be allowed in a Revolutionary Marxian Party.   Whatever may be contended against Turati, Eautsky, Hilferding, Hilouit, Longuet and Macdonald ought surely to apply with greater force to  I men such as Malone.   To allow a Maione to lead a revolutions party after a record such as his is high treason to CommunisHe/
He has convened a Conference for December 25th to consider the famous twenty-one points of the Third International.   To judge from former Conferences of the kind, this Conference will expend itself in:recrimination.LBNIN AND COMMIST TACTICS IN GREAT BRITAINWilliam Paul, who is at present in Russia as a &quot;delegate: of the Communist Party of Great Britain to the International&quot;, has had &quot;a long and interesting interview&quot; with Lenin, on the &quot;growth and progress of Communism in Britain&quot;.   Stripped of the syoophanfs verbiage, his account of the interview is not uninteresting, in that it shows Lenin to have a-better grasp of the revolutionary movement in Great Britain than was the case a few months ag$.   Lenin is apparently chiefly concerned with the relations between the Labour Party and the Communist groups.   He is of opinion that the next general election will be.of paramount importance and the communists ought to play a most important part -in it. Lenin advises the communists to help the Labour Party to get a majority at the next election in order to facilitate the general decadence of the Parliamentary system.   The masses, who had neither the time&quot;nor the inclination to examine social theories, always learn their political lessons by concrete experience.   The revolutionary communist must prove his theories correct by compelling his opponents to act in such a way that they provide the practical lessons which enable the communist to test his theories before the eyes of the masses. At the forthcoming elections the Communist Party ought to contest as many seats as possible, but when it pould not put up a candidate it should issue a manifesto urging the workers to vote for the Labour candidate &quot;in order that Henderson MacDonald &amp; Co., may demonstrate to the masses their sheer helplessness.&quot;Lenin/
Lenin concluded the interview with the followinginstructive remarks:&quot;Here in Kussia we have been forced by circumstances to discuss and make arrangements with elements which would hang us if they got the chance. Have we not even entered into alliances and compacts with Governments whose very hands reeked with the blood of our murdered Communist comrades?   Why   have we entered into such contracts and adopted sucn a policy? It is because we are realists and not Utopians.   It is because, at present, international capitalism is more powerful than we are.   Every move, each Treaty and all our negotiations with capitalist States, are but one side of the Russian Soviet Government&apos;s policy to conserve its strength in order to consolidate its power.   Learn to meet yo*r enemies and be not afraid.&quot;&quot;THE ALL-INCLUSIVE INTERNATIONAL&quot;The die-hards of the Independent Labour Party have submitted proposals for a &quot;Reconstructed International&quot; to the Berne Conference which is now sitting.   The conference, which is the outcome of a resolution passed at the annual meeting of the Independent Labour Party in Glasgow this year, is merely consultative and it is extremely unlikely that it will elicit anything but abuse from Moscow.   The statement admits that the International of 1914 was &quot;ineffective&quot; but insists that national parties must be allowed to adopt their own tactics as long as they are consistent with the declared policy of the world socialist movement, and that &quot;there must be no attempt to impose conditions or insist that the methods of one country must be adopted in another.&quot; The aims of this International will be &quot;the ending of the present capitalist system and exploitation of labour, as well as all forms of economic and hereditary privilege, and the establishment of a system by which the community will own,      ! organise and control its resources for the benefit of all.&quot; 4: ITh e/ &apos;&apos;1 !
The Independent labour Party suggests that the International should be composed of National Socialist Parties, which by their national policy show that they are genuinely Socialist and in their activities are independent of all bourgeois  parties and aim at Socialist ends, and further that the International shall appoint an Sxeeutive, whioh will between conferences act as a Court of Appeal,&apos; and advise should the tactics of any national party be called in question.Delegates at the conference represent the German Bight Independent Socialists, end the socialist parties of France, Africa, Austria, Switzerland, ktvit. and Czecho-Slovakia; Wellhead, Johnson and Shinwell represent the Independent labour Party.The left Wing or Communist Section of the Independent labour Party has issued a strongly worded &quot;alternative policy&quot;for the party, which it proposes to describe as a oommuniet organisation, whose aim is to destroy the present system of capitalism and to establish &quot;communal control through an industrial and social administrative organisation of the working class.&quot;  Transition to the soviet form of administration is to be achieved by means of &apos; the dictatorship of the proletariat, whioh is interpreted as the organisation of the workers &quot;as a ruling class to crush all resistance on the part of the exploiters to the work of Socialist reconstruction.&quot;SOUTH WALES miners in the December issue of &quot;The Workers&apos; Bomb&quot;, the new organ of the Rhondda unofficial movement, A. J. Coek draws ,a picture of the future policy of tbe South Wales &quot;ginger ^group.&quot;  He claims that the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation must be centralised with rank and file control.   Every member must have eo.ual treatment and benefits and the Executive must consistof/
of rank and file members only.   Wo full time official is to &quot;be on the Executive except in an advisory capacity. The Miners&apos; Federation ^must also be brought under rank and file control and all disputes must he classified under the headings, &quot;Safety, Wages, Hours, Customs.&quot;THE ASSOCIATED SOCIETY OP LOCOMOTIVE &amp;NGINEMSN AND FIREMENDuring 1920, this society is reported to have increased its membership by over 17,000, making a total of about 72,000.   Contributions from Branches amounted to  83,000 as against  44,000 last year.   It is interesting to note that the society, whioh is one of the most pugnacious, has spent  22,000 in legal assistance-to members. Many members of the National Union of Railwayraen have seceded to the Associated Society of Locomotive ling in e men and Firemen and a section of supervisors io .also considering the possibility of transferring.C* E. MALONE. M.P.On behalf of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, MaoManue, Watts and Inkpin ask in this week&apos;s &quot;Communist&quot; for contributions towards the expenses of Malone, who &quot;acting on our advice&quot; is appealing againet his sentence.In connection with the appeal, Harold Grehfell hasmade the following interesting suggestion:&quot;As regards Counsel for the appeal:   If you regard the appeal merely from its so-called 1 legal&apos; aspect, then have counsel.   If you are thinking of it at all as a &quot;political platform1 then you will be your own   \ best advocate.   If, in the first case. Barrington Ward will.undertake not to be unduly moderate^   I recommendyou to hafre him again, otherwise Percy Bandcock can make a good shew.&quot;Malone has lately written a letter to Hease on Bouse of Commons notepaper, enclosing a cutting from the&quot;Westminster/
&quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;. &quot;A doughty fighter.   Commander Kenworthy honoured by his friends&quot;, and under this he writes:&quot;For Christ&apos;b sake keep him in the Party and donftlet him g.a Rod.&quot;TBS &quot;DAILY BSRffl&quot;According to a circular issued by liarnest Bevin, the premises secured in Manchester for the Northern Edition of the &quot;Daily Rerald&quot; have been taken for twenty years at the rate of  600 a year.   It is estimated that 450,000 copies will be printed.   Recently, he says, the paper was losing  3,000 a week, but since the price has been raised to 2d. a profit of  1,000 a week has been made.   These figures are believed to be quite at variance with the facts.The much advertised &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Push is believed to be a campaign to conceal the use of Russian money.   The demands made by the paper upon its readers are considerable. &apos; The 300,000 alleged readers are to place &quot; a poster in two front windows, one from the top window sill, a streamer hanging from the roof, a showcard from your knocker and a poster&apos; on your chimney pot.&quot;   The reward for complying with this request is a prize of  5 if a photograph of the victimised house is sent to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and incidentally, we may suppose, if the proprietor does not break his leg.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; made a great show at the recent Advertising Exhibition at the White City.SINN FED! W GggAT Britain there has been no further outbreak of Sinn Fein violence in England, although several Officers of the Irish Republican Arrayare/
-  &apos; jj*- 10 -are believed to be in London.   The fact that precautions have been taken and that the Authorities can count on the co-operation of the whole of the public has no doubt damped -the initiative of the violent section, but it is not safe to assume that the danger is past.   If power were taken under the Defence of the Realm Act to send back to Ireland a few persons who are known to be dangerous the movement for violence in England would be broken.   Several large meetings have been held in the London area.   At Canning Town on December 5th Mr. Devlin, M.P., had an enthusiastic reception from about 3,000 people.   Re was supported by Mr. Jack Jones and Mr, Will Thome, the last named moving a resolution in favour of allowing Ireland to form a Republic   On the following day at Barking Mr. Devlin addressed a large meeting, supported by Messrs. Jack Jones, 0&apos;Sullivan and John Scurr.On December 6th Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington addressed a meeting in the Minerva Cafe&quot;.   It was one of a series on &quot;Peace with Ireland&quot;, arranged by the Fellowship of Reconoilia-tion.   Other meetings of the same kind are to be held in Bermondsey, Tottenham and Bow,The number of people who attended the Albert Hall Meeting addressed by Mr. Asquith must have been very disappointing to the promoters, for there were only about 2,000 people present. There was considerable interruption from Sinn Feiners.Liverpool has been quiet, although fully 10,000 people crowded the streets at the funeral of the lad Ward.   The prohibition of Irish meetings and processions has relieved the feelings of the loyalists, which is fortunate, for feeling between the two factions is running very high and a serious riot might very easily take place.   The decision to prevent   gDr./
Dr. Mannix visiting the Meraeyside caused a sensation among his supporters.On Deoember 5th two Irish women were arrested at Seal&apos;or th and detained under the Defence of the Realm Regulations,   On flovember 26tb Thomas Murphy was arrested in Manchester and charged with being in unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition.The houses of several Sinn Feiners in St. Helen&apos;s were raided simultaneously on December 1st and a considerable quantity of Sinn Fein literature and documents relating to the Irish Self-Determination League were found.Glasgow Sinn Feiners are greatly alarmed by police activity and in conaetjttence drilling has practically ceased for the time being.   Successful raids have been made on Sinn Fein haunt8 and it is known that several men have been issued inflammable spirit with whioh to start conflagrations.   One of my correspondents who has made special investigations iaXof opinion that attempts will be made to wreok publio buildings.An important oapture was made by the Alloa police onDecember 5th; two men named Henry Coyle and Charles McGinn,were arrested when in charge of a motor oar, which they haddriven from Covtdenbeath, containing;3 owt. of gelignite and sameonito explosives in loosecakes,,300 detonators strum2 service rifles Z bayonets 3 revolversIt is believed that the explosives were stolen in small quantities from the mines; almost every cake or cartridge bore signs of having been fingered by dirty hands.   The tten arrasted are said to be Irishmen.The Labour Party, backed by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, is trying to work up agitation for an Irish &quot;truce&quot; and Mr. JUthurHenderson/
Henderson has returned from Ireland &quot;with a demand for an armistice.&apos;&apos;   Labour shows, however, little interest in the question, although , there seems to be among all classes a growing feeling that the present conditions have become intolerable. IRELAND &apos; :&apos; .      r;:...... --^i.&apos;--- ;   ,.       p$$gThe state of tho Provinces during the past week has shown no improvement.   There was a considerable increase in the number of outrages recorded, the total number for the period:being 256 as against 209 for the previous weok; of these 116&apos;were directly-attributable to Sinn Fein, 5 had agrarian origin and 157 were outrages to which neither politicalnor agrarian motives could be assigned.   Intimidation by Sinn Fein of civilians still continues and a girl in Limerick had her hair cut off and was otherwise  &apos; brutally assaulted on account of her friendship to the police.Wile on the surface np improvement in the condition of the , provinces apoears the weariness of the general public-of outrage -and murder is beginning to show itself in outward protestations.. There is, however, no denying the fact that this &quot;is due father to economic than to moral causes.The economic position at present is deplorable.&apos; The dislocation-, tion of the railways is increasinr day by day while the restrictio; on motor transport are beginning to cause paralysis of trade inplaces1where motor transport was substituted for rail transport.&quot;      \- &quot;4&apos;&apos; jj n j;* *^ ,4T&apos;&apos;r *st- i-,s     .,The result is that employment is increasing to&quot;ah extent which isj alarming the labour leaders.The &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; appeared as usual.   It contains a very violent article headed. &quot;What is the Portent?   A Christmas message&quot; urging the righteousness of war waged by an oppressed people-for. their existence against a s o ul- d e stir eying &apos; b ody-enslaving paganism.Any compromise, on the part of the Government&apos;&apos; with-sthe foroej of disorder would be extremely prejudicial to the chances of t&apos;complete/&apos;
complete early disruption and overthrow of Sinn Fein.   The majority of people in Ireland are longing for peace.   If they get it as the result of negotiations between Sinn flein and the British Government, Sinn Fein will have gained an enormous victory.   The only safe basis of negotiation is that of unconditional surrender on the part of Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army.
