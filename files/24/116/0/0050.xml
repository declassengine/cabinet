(Thlo n0Cyment It imk&amp;W&apos;^His Britannic Govenffig^2505DECONTROL OF BACON.i i m jnir in n        niiiuinniiiiwimj-  iirri   hi    h      i i     m man j memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Food Controller has brought up again the question of the decontrol of bacon.- Into the merits of the question in its domestic aspect I do not propose to enter.   But I wish to impress upon the Cabinet the seriously prejudicial effect control in peace time has upon inter-Imperial rela-tions.   It is inevitable that in dealing with a Government department at this end the producers in the Dominions should enlist the services of their Governments to back them, with the result that what begins as a commercial transaction rapidly develops into a controversy between two Governments, and, if it reaches Parliament, even between two countries in the Empire.   I do not know any class of question since the Armistice which has given more trouble or caused greater friction.   I understand that the Ministry of Food has con-sistently given some measure of preference to Empire products over those from foreign countries.  But the Dominions are persuaded that this is not so, and since control has been taken off British home produce, they contend that we are frankly discriminating against them,A long and difficult controversy over Canadian bacon was settled on November 17th, to this extent that the Canadian Government accepted as satisfactory the latest proposals of the Ministry of Food.  But how little it was really satisfied appears from the following telegram from the Canadian Prime Minister to the Acting Hinh Commissioner which he showed me a few days ago:We understand British Cabinet discussing question termination of Ministry Food which would includedecontrol
2611decontrol Canadian Bacon.   This question most vital one to an important Canadian industry and this country has suffered heavily because of control.   Can you ascertpin if such measure contemplated and if so Dominion Government would like opportunity to state its case against control of Canadian bacon.  While we recognize that in large measure control is one of internal policy yet the methods adopted have been discriminatory against Canada. Meighen.I repeat, I am not concerned with the merits of the case either as regards the domestic situation, or as regards the actual facts of the past controversy with the Canadian Government over bacon.   The fact remains that the control is regarded as unfriendly to Canada, and, as far as I am concerned, I should be glad if it were removed either as far as the British Empire is concerned, or altogether.The Cabinet will observe that Mr. Meighen is very anxious that the case of his Government against control should be&apos; stated.   If the decision now is in favour of decontrol that will not arise.   But if the Cabinet is generally in favour of maintaining control, I do not think it would be courteous to Mr. Meighen that a decision should actually be taken until after the High,Commissioner has been asked either in writing, or preferably personally, to state the Canadian case.M.7. 12. 20.
