In my memorandum of the 5th August last4I recommend that this proposal should be adopted and that the work should be assigned to the Home Office as the Department whioh has always been responsible for dealing with questions of workmen1s compensation and which is best qualified by its general knowledge and experience cf the working and administration of the Act-In memoranda which have been circulated by the Chancellor of the ExchequerJff^-and the Ministry of Healtn it has, however, been suggested that the work should be assigned to the Ministry of Health.The Home Affairs Committee considered the point at their meeting on the 16th November last and decided to refer the question back to the Cabinet for decision.At this meeting, the Minister of Health expressed the view that while the medical and treatment functions should be assigned to his Department, the judicial and administrative work, apart from that of treatment, should remain in the Home OfficeiThis really ooincides with my own view.      Workmen&apos;s Compensation is not primarily, ar even to any substantial degree, a health matter, and there are in my opinion weighty reasons (to which I refer below) why the general body of the work should not be removed from the Home Office;   but there are some duties involved which come wholly or in part within the scope of the Ministry of Health, and, so far as these are concerned, I am of opinion -that they should be carried out either by the Ministry or in closest co**   -operation with the Ministry.     These duties are connected with -(l) Medical and surgical treatment of the injured workman; (2) Appointment of Medical Referees.As regards (l), the Departmental Committee recommended that further provisions should be made for injured workmen as a benefit&apos;under the Act (see page 7 of my previous memorandum).   In my opinion this provision should be made, not by special scheme, but as part of the general arrangements made by the Ministry of Health for the treatment of sick and injured persons, and the whole responsibility for it should rest with the Ministry.     The only duty which the Home Office should undertake in this connexion would be to settle, in consultation with the representatives of insurance companies and employers, the arrangements for the collection from employers of the monies necessary to defray the expense (in the. case of insured employers the money
would be oolleoted as part of the premium).As regards (2), the Medical Referees appointed by the Home Office under the Act are attached to particular County Courts and are substantially in the position of Officers of the Court, their chief duty being to advise the County Court Judge on medical questions, either by sitting with him as assessor or by furnishing a written report.    They must accordingly possess not only high professional qualifications but must also command the esteem and confidence both of the judges themselves and of the public, and they are invariably appointed on the personal recommendation or with the concurrence of the Judge.     In these oircumstances I do not think that the Home Office could diveBt itself of all responsibility in regard to these Officers, but I; am con-confident - and feel sure that the Minister of Health will agree - that. a scheme could be worked out between the two Departments which would fully safeguard the interests of the Ministry in this matter.A further matter in whioh the Ministry of Health is concerned is the proposal made by the Departmental Committee in connexion with  their scheme of compulsory insurance that the National Health Inspectors when inspecting works under the Health Insurance Scheme should at the same time ascertain whether the employer was insured for workmen&apos;s compensation.    The Ministry have signified their willingness to fall in with this proposal and I can see no reason why this arrangement should not work satisfactorily.    It is a question merely of proper co-operation between the two Departments.Apart from the consideration that workmen1 s compensation lies generally outside the sphere of the Ministry of Health, there are several strong reasons for keeping the work in the Home Office.A* ULTIMATE EFFECT OK THE, PRESENT SYSTEM. OF WORKMEN 3 COMPENSATION.The Departmental Committee recommended that workmen&apos;a compensation should not be amalgamated with sickness insurance or otherwise &quot;nationalized&quot;, but should, subject to supervision on the part of the State in certain directions, be allowed to continue on present lines.     The transfer of workmen&apos;s compensation to the Health Insurance Department would however encourage the idea that workmen&apos;s compensation and sickness insurance are on the same footing and would lead on the one side to a demand that the sickness benefits should be commensurate with the aocident benefits, and on the other side to a demand for nationalization of workmen&apos;s compensation with a State&apos; contribution.     Separate administration of sickness and accident insurance is important in order to secure that the two systems continue to develope on separate lines.For this reason, I anticipate that insurance oompanies and employers would be strongly opposed to the transfer of the work to the Ministry of Health.B. WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION AND PREVENTION OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS.There is a close relation between workmen&apos;s compensation and the work of the Factory Department of the Home Office which is responsible for the investi-gation and prevention of   industrial accidents and diseases.     If they were in
the hands of different Departments, the results would bo serious for both. Some of the workmen1b compensation duties can only be done with the expert advice and assistance of the Factory Inspectors.     These duties involve almost daily consultation with the Factory Department, and Factory Inspectors are constantly employed on speoial investigations in connection therewith.Again, while acoident prevention has not hitherto been linked up with compensation, insuranoe companies have now recognised that it is their interest and duty to assist in the reduotion of industrial accidents and have promised to give the Factory Department their willing co-operation. This co-operation, which has proved so useful in Amerioa in reducing industrial aocidents, might have excellent results also in this country.&apos; It could be most unfortunate if this opportunity should be lost.0* RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTY COURTS.The Department administrating workmen&apos;s compensation has in the past been brought into close touoh with the Judges and Registrars of the Oounty Courts and will be brought in the future into still closer relation. Under the Committee^ proposals it will have to exercise a oertain degree of direct supervision over the Registrars, and the Home Office seems clearly the more suitable Department for this purpose.E.S.8.12.20.7R64-66.
