This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,SECRET.CP. 2224.THE CABINET.THE NAVY AND ARMY CANTEEN BOARD AND PRIVATETRADING.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to the suggestion, made by the First Lord of the Admiralty in his Memorandum, of 30th September (C. P. 1910), that retail shops of the Navy and Army Gen Canteen Board should be opened in naval garrison towns, I circulate a memorandum 2  pointing out certain difficulties which would arise from the adoption of the First Lord&apos;s proposal and drawing attention to certain pledges which have been made in Parliament on ihe subject of competition by the Navy and Army Canteen Board with the private trader.w. s. c.the war office,3rd December, 1920.1. Generally speaking, the trading of the Navy and Army Canteen Board is confined to shops situated on War Department property. During the war, however, as a temporary measure, retail stores were set up by the Board in certain towns on land other than that belonging to the War Department. These, however, have now all been closed.2. The privilege of making purchases at Navy and Army Canteen Board shops was enjoyed by all those entitled under &quot;Kings Regulations&quot; to buy from regimental institutes, namely, officers and soldiers, with their families and servants, together with certain civilians, who were permanently employed on military services on War Department land, and who received written permission from a General Officer Commanding. By an Army Order of July, 1917, however, families of soldiers in receipt of separation or dependants allowance were excluded irom this privilege, which was restored to them by a subsequent Army Order of June, 1919.3. Ever since the Armistice strong protests have been made by a large number of Chambers of Commerce, Traders&apos; Associations, &amp;c, against these retail shops which were situated off War Department land, and which, it was alleged, constituted a form of State competition with the private trader. Several questions were asked in Parliament on the subject during last Session, and on 3rd June the Financial Secretary to the War Office, on behalf of the Secretary of State, received a deputation, introduced by Lord Wolmer, M.P., and representing over 70 Chambers of Commerce, municipalities, and local authorities.Assurances were given both in Parliament^ and to this deputation that there was no intention that the Navy and Army Canteen Board should compete with private traders for the custom of the general public. It has also been made quite clear that the only civilians allowed to make purchases at Navy and Army Canteen Board&apos;s establishments on War Department land are those referred to in paragraph 2 above; moreover, such civilians must be provided with a pass signed by the Secretary of the Navy and Army Canteen Board.* Extract from Hansard, 22nd June, 1920, column 1983 :-Colonel Ashley: &quot; Is not the Government going into competition with &apos; private traders&apos; ? &quot;Sir A. Williamson: &quot; Yes, so far as the forces are concerned there is competition with private trade, but there is no competition in regard to supplying civilians outside those people I have mentioned connected with the forces.......&quot;(B20/431)   100  12/20  h&amp;S,Ltd  8658wo
24. The deputation also protested against the present scope of trading of the Navy and Army Canteen Board, which, it was pointed out, sold such articles as women&apos;s outfitting, furniture, cutlery, drugs, &amp;c., such articles, it was contended, being quite outside the scope of the trading of the organization when it was first started.The Financial Secretary invited the deputation to give evidence and make recommendations on. the scope of trading-to the Inter-Departmental Committee, which consists of representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry, and which is at present considering the future of the ,Navy and Army Canteen Board, and they accordingly attended the War Office again on 23rd August for this purpose.The main recommendation of the deputation was that the Navy and Army Canteen Board should restrict its trading to the provision of actual foodstuffs and commodities -usually found in a soldier&apos;s club or philanthropic institution which caters for the soldier. The other points chiefly deal with the non-payment of rent, income tax, rates, &amp;c, by &apos; the Navy and Army Canteen Board, and the strict limitation of the privilege of purchase at the Navy and Army Canteen Board&apos;s establishments to officers and men and their families.The Financial Secretary promised that the points raised by the deputation would receive the earnest attention of the Inter-Departmental Committee which has not yet completed its work. He pointed out, however, that the limitations suggested by the deputation would not cover the needs of the sailor and soldier at home, and much less os abroad.5. The Inter-Departmental Committee has not yet issued its report, but, in view of the closing down of all the retail Navy and Army Canteen Board shops not bn War Department land, following upon definite assurances made in Parliament, the opening of fresh establishments, as proposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, would certainly lead to very strong protests from the trading community and it would be desirable to avoid any extensions until the policy to be pursued has been comprehensively considered and decided.
