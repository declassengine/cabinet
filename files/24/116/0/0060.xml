Stipulations which are mutatis mutandis identical to th?se of Article 14 of the Czecho-Slovak Treaty are also contained in Article 12 of the Treaty between the Principal Allied and Associated Powers and Poland, signed at Versailles 28th June 1919. By a resolution of the Council of the League of Nations of February 13th, 1920, it was decided that the stipulations in Articles I &amp; II of the Polish Treaty should be placed under the guarantee of the League of Nations so far as they affect persons belonging to racial, religious or linguistic minorities.

Similar decisions were taken by the Council during its last session at Bruxelles, with regard to the Minorities clauses of the Treaties of Peace with Austria and Bulgaria.

Chapter I., Articles 1- 3 of the Czecho-Slovak Treaty can clearly be accepted by the League of Nations.

The same applies to Chapter II, Articles 10-13, of the Treaty. Under Article 10 Czecho-Slovakia undertakes to constitute the Ruthene territory south of the Carpathians within frontiers delimited by the Principal Allied and Associated powers, as an autonomous unit within the Czecho-Slovak state and to accord to it the fullest degree of safe-government compatible with the unity of the Czecho-Slovak, State. Articles 11-13 define certain aspects of the future relations between Czecho-Slovakia and the Ruthene territory.

The Czecho-Slovak Government will doubtless give the League of Nations all the information which may be required cencerning the actual constitution of this territory as an autonomous unit. It may also be assumed that the Principal Allies and Associated Governments will keep the League informed with regard to the delimitation of the territory.

A copy of the Treaty is attached for convenience of reference.
