(U-iic DOCUMENT 12 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BKlTAjmX JjLA,TESTY*S QOTERW&amp;A.jCOPY NO.SECRET. &apos;  &apos;C /, E I N E T.CP. 2214A. ---, OUR AMERICAN DEBT.Supplementary Note by the Chancel lor of the Exc ]^qiior^(of. CP,2214.)I call the attention of the Cabinet to Sir A. geddes telegram No, 818 of December 2nd from which I extract all that is relevant to Anglo-American Debt. &quot;British debt to America. Colonel House believes that America will - ultimately be driven by economical pressure to cancel debts owed her by Chancellor of the Exchequer and coun-sels continuation by His MajestyJs Government of their policy of inactivity in this matter.   He thinks distress in cities and on farms which will follow hard: on heels of stagnation now developing in American export trade, . will lead to.appointment of.a Federal Commission of Enquiry which, in his opinion, will inevitably discover main obstacle to export trade is existence of huge international debts and that thereafter Congress will cancel them in whole or in part. .This may be a correct view but I venture to think that Colonel House&apos;s forecast is not likely to be justifiedjby events.   It appears to me much more likely that if distress develops clamour to compel England to pay its debts- will drown all sensible voices and that, failing direct payment, United States Government will demand right to sell bonds to amount of our&quot;debt to individual purchasers and further, that every official British act involving expenditure will be dragged up and discussed in Congress and Press
as Britain&quot;s use of America&apos;s money while Americans are in financial difficulties.   Personally I regret this mutter was not settled&apos;&apos; on best terms that could have been obtained as I believe worse terms will, in all pro-bability, be accepted later.   I agree, however, it is a difficult question to decide and that final decision turns upon a correct appreciation of American mass psychology; for this is a matter which will be decided by feelings of American people and not by United States GovernmentI do not,presume to question the good faith of Colonel House, hut Colonel House is a party man though perhaps no longer a convinced Wilsonian, and I believe that--in this matter our   mbassador had a surer hold and is a better adviser than Colonel House himself.This telegram strengthens my conviction that we must try at once to come to a definite arrangement with the United States as proposed in the paper (CP,2214) wM&apos;ch I have just circulatedn   But it does more,.   The argument used by Colonel House against this course leads me to ask the Cabinet to reconsider their refusal to accept the policy in regard to Inter-Ally Debt which-I proposed to them in a paper dated. May-,12th, 1920; (CP.1259)*Europe cannot buy for want of credit0   We are suffer-ing because Europe cannot buy.   It is sometimes suggested that the British Government should place further credits at the disposition of.foreign countries ,   This would be contrary to the Declaration of the Supreme Council on the Economic Condition,of the World at their London meeting, and equally contrary to the recommendations of the BrusselsEconomic Conference.   Apart from this we cannot afford to do it... No one can continue indefinitely to pay in cashand to sell on credit,:.: %M ;! W^-:f&apos;Mfl I This.   -2-
This, therefore-, we cannot do.    But wo can free the credit of our Allies by remitting nor the debt incurred by thorn to us in tho cordon prosecution of the &quot;:ar on condition that each of oufc debtors does the same to those who are indebted to h3iuI regard the obligations of Prance, Italy, Serbia and Greece held by the brltish Government as of little worthy In the state of exhaustion to which Europe has been reduced these debts cannot be paid*    Even interest on them cannot be collected for some time and then only, at the cost of a permanently debased exchange9 lessened purchasing power and increased commercial competition wherever the products of our Allies compete with m*rs*    9?o maintain the shadow with little or no prospect of receiving the substance or any part of it within a reasonable time seems to mo bad business-.Surely it is even worse policy*     Our relations with our Allies are sufficiently difficult in any case.    If over every future French and Italian budget is to hang the shadow of a debt to Great Britain? if every French and Italian tax-payer is to be told by the Opposition (and perhaps by the Government) of the day that tho reason why his taxes are so high Is because England demands her pound of flesh, then I do not envy the task of our Foreign Secretary    There cannot be good relations in the world when the first and principal connection of those who should be moat closely united is that of debtor and creditor.I plead again and most earnestly for a beau goste,, and that without delay.Since the United States cannot comprehend it and will not make it, lei us face up to our obligations to them.    But let us at the same time do toe right and the wise thing to-wards our Continental Allies *    If there is any foundation for the view expressed by Colonel House that America will ultimately be forced to cancel the debts owing to her by thediscove
discovery that these debts are the main obstacle to their export trade, mx action will hasten that discovery. President Wilson cannot now take this course, but tho policy of the incoming President is not yet defined. Surely this Is the moment when the example set by us may be decisive for the policy of the new Administration. But be that as it iaay and whether those hopes are realised or not, I hold strongly that we ought to act; and in spite of the immense burdens which our people are called upon to bear, I believe that such action would have their hearty approval.    For whatever be our national faults, our people are not fools and they are not ungenerous to old friends and comrades.(Intld).   AoCTreasury S.??c3rd December, 1920.P.S.   To prevent misconception, I add that though the treatment of Ruasia (eventually) and of Greece (now) should not necessarily be different, I recognise that they require special and separate consideration at the present time.
