TH1 ASSOCIATION FOR MORAL AITD SOCIAL HTGIBMEOrchard House, . 2 &amp; 4 Great Smith St.S3. 1.7th October.,. 1920 .The Rt. Hon. sir pric nrummona, K.C.K.G.,. C.B.Dear sir,we desire through yru to address the League of nations in regard to a subject which ought to be considered when defining the renditions on which mandates are to be given for the tutelage of certain territories.The cencitiono, aocorcing to article XXII in the covenant of the league;, include &quot;the maintenance of publii order and morals and &quot;the.prohibition of abuses such a3 the slave trade&apos;.   We respectfully ur^e that in order to carry out both the letter and the spirit of these conditions in the mandatory territories it will be necessary, owing to the often peculiarly helpless position of women in these areas, to expressly prohibit any approach to the system knewn as Reflation (or Reglementation), cf prostitu-tion.Under Article XXIII the Lea/^ue is entrusted with super-vision over the execution of the international agreements for the suppression of traffic in women.   rTe would point out that there is abundant evidence that the system of Regulation, which gives official tolerance or/recognition to houses of prostitution (bordells), is eiosciy connected with the traffic in women, and that the evils of this system are likely to-be intensified in areas such as the mandatory territories,   &apos; ;e therefore ask(1) That all mandatory territories shall adhere to&apos; the international agreements for the suppression of traffic in women,(2) That, as the regulation of prostitution is one    &apos; of the most important oontributery causes of the traffic, in women, the mandates given &quot;by the &apos; League of Rations for the administration of undeveloped countries shall all be subject to the condition that the re.gula.tion of prosti-tution&apos; in all its forms shall be forbidden within themandatory territories.
&quot;&quot;e believe that these conditions, if insisted upon, will raise the status of all women, and will make the &quot;traffic in women&quot; difficult, if not impossible.Vfc are aware that these conditions would prevent theintroduction of.any special sanitary control of women believed to be prostitutes, but we submit that this will be a benefitrather than a detriment to the public health.   In support ofthis assertion we would refer to the foil awing;-The French 7xtra-parliamentary Commission which reported&quot; In *l9o6&apos; unanimously condemned&quot; the whole system of &quot; e^ulatio;-.The international   edical Con.gress held in London 1913 was practically unanimous&quot; in&quot; admitting that the policy of Regulation is an hygienic failure and ou,^ht to be abandoned.The British Royal C oiarois si on on^ ye nor e al Jpi &amp; eases which repented in&quot; 1916&quot;unanimouily&quot;*dccjared&quot;aft&quot;e&apos;r&quot;hearin,? expert continentalcana other witnesses that no advantage would accrue. from a return to the Requisition system.&quot;ve ask that you will place this letter before the council when it is consider! ig questions relating to the terms ofmandates.On behalf of the Association for   oral and Soaial Hygiene, *&apos;e are,Yours faithfully,(Signed)   0.0&quot;.
