Id. continuation of our telegram No. 1334 S., dated 19th November, the following is a further telegram No. 285, dated 13th November, from Consul-General at Kashgar: &quot; In continuation of my telegram No. 279, dated 7th November. My representa-tive lias returned and gist of his interview with Bokhara Mission is as follows :  Bokhara is in hands of Bolshevik Mussulman renegades and (? young) Bokhara party. Amir of Bokhara is at Hissar, 1.15, miles (? south) east of Samarcand with 4,000 persons. Mission was sent by Amir with letters requesting help from British Government, and it left Hissar 21st October., and arrived at Chinese frontier 4th November.  Mission is sending me letters, which I will forward you at once.&quot; Afghan intervention in Bokhara was not successful, as only a few tooops were employed and Afghans seem unwilling to (? word omitted) Bokhara. Afghan Amir aims at bringing Pamirs, (? Fer)ghana, Transcaspia and Bokhara under his influence and contemplates the seizure of Russian Pamirs. Bokhara, on the other hand, wishes autonomy (? under) British (? auspices) (corrupt group); Mussulmans throughout Central Asia wish, to end Bolshevik regime. Sher Mahomed of Ferghana, as I previously reported, sent missions to Kabul, Bokhara and Constantinople requesting help and urged Mussulmans should unite against Bolsheviks. There is apparently no idea of Pan-Islamic Confederation for formation of Moslem States, only aim being to it (sic) rid Central Asia of Bolsheviks. Full details of political situation follow by post.&quot; As laid down in your telegram No. 483, dated 24th April 1919, there can be no question of British intervention, and I propose to inform Mission accordingly, but at the same time you may wish me to convey message from Government of India to Amir, in which case please wireless me.&quot;We are informing- Consul-General that no message should be sent until letter reaches us.
