CONFIDENTIAL.No. 19.Second Congress of the Third International-July-August 1920.INTRODUCTION.This report gives a short summary of the proceedings of the second congress of the Third International, held at Moscow between the 18th of July and the 7th of August this year, and sets out the decisions which were arrived at to forward the communist revolutionary movement throughout the world.In order, however, to understand clearly the new developments in Bolshevik policy, which may be anticipated as a result of this second international conference, it seems advisable in the first instance to explain briefly the principles for which the Third International stands. They were laid down at the first International Communist Congress which was held at Moscow from the 2nd to the 6th of March 1919.*The Third International.The object for which the Bolsheviks called together their first inter-national Congress was to lay down a definite policy for the immediate establishment of the universal dictatorship of the proletariat.In their invitations to the Congress the Moscow leaders declared that this dictatorship must be achieved by the mass action of the proletariat, which implied : (1) The seizure of the powers of government by the proletariat; (2) the disarmament of the bourgeoisie and the general arming of the proletariat; (3) the suppression of private property and its transfer to &quot; the proletarian State under the socialistic ministration of the working classes.&quot; They also clearly stated that the policy of the extremists in the radical parties in all countries must be to separate themselves from the moderates, to dissociate themselves from the Second or Berne International, &quot;to rally all the working class groups and &quot; organizations which, without having openly joined the revolutionary &quot; movements, nevertheless show a tendency towards the left in their &quot; development,&quot; to &quot;subordinate the interests of the movement in each &quot; country to the general interest of the international revolution as a &quot; whole.&quot;The first Congress was in no sense a full or representative inter-national gathering, as many of the delegates failed to put in an* Thirty-nine organizations or groups professing revolutionary aims more or less in accord with the communist aims were invited by wireless from Moscow to send delegates to this congress. Thus, invitations were addressed to the communist parties in Russia, German-Austria, Hungary, Holland, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, White Russia, the Ukraine, and Poland, and also to the spartioist union in Germany, the &quot;class struggle group&quot; in Denmark, the socialist parties in Italy, Roumaniaj Bulgaria, Siberia, and Norway, the left socialist party in Sweden, the British socialist party and the socialist labour party in Great Britain, the socialist labour party in the United States of America, and the Japanese socialists represented by Katayana, the left sections of the socialist parties in France, Switzerland, Spain, Czeeho-Slovakia, Portugal, and the United States of America, and of the labour parties in Belgium and Ireland. Representatives from revolutionary industrial organizations, such as the American industrial workers of the world, the British shop stewards, and the revolutionary branch of the French trade union movement were also asked to be present.0  (33) AS8537 Wtl7270-C439  150  12/20 B&amp;S A
appearance, but a provisional constitution was drawn up which was subsequently ratified, and contains tho accepted principles of the Third Internationa].   They may be briefly summarised as follows :  (1) The overthrow of capitalism.(2) The substitution of tho soviet system for parliamentary and local government.(3) The dictatorship of the proletariat during the period of transition*     from capitalism to communism. (4) The socialisation of hind and industries.(5) The enforcement of labour from every member of the community as a guarantee of food. (6) The equal remuneration of all workers and the free education andmaintenance of all students. (7) The self-determination of peoples. (8) The abolition of all racial distinctions.(9) The disarming of the bourgeoisie in all countries and the arming of the proletariat until the complete suppression of capitalism should do away with the necessity for the employment of arms.(10) The establishment of a world federation of communist republics.Having drawn up this inspiring programme, the delegates dispersed to their respective countries full of renewed energy and revolutionary zeal.In November 1919, Rutgers, a Dutch communist, appeared in Amsterdam with a mandate from the Executive of the Third Inter-national to establish a sub-bureau of the International in that city. The members of this sub-bureau were Rutgers, Henrietta Roland-Hoist, and Wynkoop. A secret conference was soon afterwards summoned by this bureau. It sat from the 3rd to the 8th of February this year, and various resolutions were passed designed to promote the interests of the Third International. It is not quite clear what exactly were the functions of the bureau, but it seems to have occupied itself mainly with propaganda. Its claim, however, to be Lenin&apos;s sole representative in Western Europe was disputed almost from its first establishment by Reich, a Bolshevik agent in Germany. This difference of opinion led to considerable trouble, the respective comrades not displaying the brotherly love and correct internationalism which might have been expected; indeed, so great became the tension between the two factions that in May the Moscow authorities were compelled to take action, and apparently decided against the claims of the Amsterdam Committee to represent their views at any rate, in that month the bureau was closed down, and its personnel is reported to have been removed to Berlin.Invitations to the Second Congress of the Third International.It is possible that the divergence of opinion with regard to policy and the mutual jealousies among their adherents which were disclosed in the dispute with regard to the Amsterdam bureau decided the Soviet Government to call together another International Congress without delay. The Bolshevik leaders probably have sufficient experience of their foreign supporters to realise the importance of reminding them from time to time that without complete unity within the ranks of the extremists the universal revolution for which they are working cannot be effected, while the foreign communists are naturally only too ready to go to Russia where they are hospitably entertained and enjoy a feeling of security to which they are unaccustomed in their own bourgeois
countries, and where they can extract, or endeavour to extract, pecuniary assistance from the Bolshevik money chest.Invitations to a second Congress in Moscow were accordingly issued in which it was stated that the object for calling together the conference was to discuss, and, if possible, to fix upon a common basis for agree-ment among the revolutionaries throughout tho world who were iu favour of the programme of the Third International. The main points which it was considered desirable to settle once for all were (I) tho attitude to be adopted in the future by tho international communists towards the moderate socialists/ and (2) the action to be taken by the communists in any country in the event of the development of a revolutionary movement within their country.Opening Proceedings of the Second Congress.The Congress opened at Petrograd on the 18th July 1920, and, after the session of inauguration, was transferred to Moscow, where the sittings were resumed on the 21st July. The closing meeting was held on the 7th August.tThe agenda for the Congress included : An introductory speech by Lenin ; a report upon Russia by Bucharin ; a speech by Trotsky on the economic reconstruction of Russia ; reports on agriculture, coal mining, social questions, child welfare and culture and Communism by Larin, Baschauow, Winizinow, Semashko, and Lunacharski respectively ; a report by Kerschenzew on revolutionary propaganda in foreign countries ; a report by Strumikiu on the subsidised press iu foreign countries ; a report by Pryanischuikow on Bolshevik foreign propaganda bureau ; a report on trade union questions by Losowsky ; and a report upon politics in England by Radek.In addition to the above agenda it was decided by the Moscow authorities that reports should be laid before the Congress by the various foreign representatives with regard to the revolutionary progress made in their respective countries, and that reports should be presented by Lenin on the prospects of a communist world revolution, by BalabanofF on the social democratic international, and by Pokrowski on immigration.Reports by Russian Bolsheviks.In his introductory address.&apos;]: Lenin began by explaining that it was a mistake to reproach the Soviet Government for the condition of disorder which still existed in Russia, and he admitted that progress in Russia was greatly hampered owing to the fact that the revolution in the West was so slow in coming. In this connection he explained that, although in Germany there were three parties. iu sympathy with the Russian Soviet Government, the party of reaction was very strong, and that &quot; Noske had been forced to quit the helm &quot; when he was unable to act as the lackey of the Entente and to make war on Russia on their behalf.* Men of the type of Ramsay Macdonald in Great Britain, Branting in Sweden, Scheidermann in Germany, Renaudel in France, and Turati in Italy, who are designated by the Bolsheviks as opportunists or renegades.t See Appendix (A) for a list of the delegates attending the Congress.j An enthusiastic lady admirer, Kata Dalstrom, one of the Swedish delegates at the Congress, states that Lenin was greeted with the greatest enthusiasm. &quot;His appearance,&quot; she writes, &quot; was insignificant, but this fact only made his wonderful &quot; personality the more overpowering. There is nothing vain or domineering to be &quot; seen in him, but when in his presence one feels instinctively that he is one of the &quot; &apos; super-men&apos; of the workVs history. ... He delivered a magnificent speech, &quot; which, however, being in Russian, was unfortunately understood by but few of the &quot; foreign representatives.&quot;a 2
He then went on to make clear to the delegates that at the present time the revolution had not made sufficient progress to enable the Bolsheviks to allow any independence within their ranks, and that it was for that reason that the Amsterdam bureau could not be tolerated. &quot;Any day &quot; may see alarming reports of the fall of the Soviet Government, and, if &quot; the proletariat in the very birth of the movement indulges in divergent &quot; action, then the day may soon come when the death of Bolshevism &quot; might in truth be reported.&quot;After thus making the delegates&apos; hair creep, he concluded his speech in a more optimistic vein and assured them that, although tho revolution in the West was so long delayed, economic conditions were such in all countries tliat sooner or later a social upheaval was everywhere inevit-able ; that capitalism was passing through a crisis which it could not survive ; that the proletariat was determined to enjoy the fruits of its labour and that it would strike its enemies from behind and establish Soviets in all countries.Bucharin in his report on Russia was at considerable pains to explain that the failure of the Bolsheviks to restore the economic life of the country was due to the havoc of war, to the misdeeds of the former imperialistic government, and to the evil machinations of the Entente. He maintained that the Bolsheviks had succeeded in their aims. They had educated the Russian people to believe in communism. They had successfully defended their country against her enemies. They had spread revolutionary propaganda throughout the world. Trotsky, in his speech on economic reconstruction, admitted that it was undemocratic to militarize labour, and then went on to explain to the delegates that this policy had been adopted in Russia merely in order to assist in the further development of communism. He maintained that existing economic conditions in Russia were better than in other countries and stated that business men were not, oppressed by the Bolsheviks. &quot; They &quot; work as the leaders of their employees and live just as well as the &quot; workmen themselves.&quot;Larin, in his report upon agriculture, after asserting that agriculture in Russia was now entirely organized by the State, he informed his audience that agriculturists were becoming enthusiastic supporters of Bolshevism. He somewhat naively attributed this state of feeling to the fact that 84 per cent, of the agriculture population in Russia did not pay taxes. In spite, however, of the alleged enthusiasm of the peasants for Bolshevism, it was decided to establish a special fund for propaganda among the agricultural population.Baschanow, in his report upon the coal question, dreAV a favourable picture of the situation and maintained that there were ample supplies of coal for the needs of the country.Winizurow, in his speech on social welfare, was far less optimistic, but said that conditions were gradually improving, while Semashko, who spoke on the subject of child welfare, assured the Congress that the most satisfactory results had been achieved by the policy of nationalizing the care and education of children. He stated that all children were being treated alike, irrespective of the class to which they happened to belong.Lunacharski, in his report upon culture and Bolshevism, explained that teachers, craftsmen, and writers were supported by the State, and that exhibitions were being held and lectures delivered even in the smallest villages. He mentioned the fact that instructors were now sent into the country districts to teach adults how to read and write, but seems to have omitted to state what success was crowning their efforts. The Congress was so much impressed by his glowing description of the intellectual renaissance in Russia that it resolved to send agents abroad
* See Appendix B in which a list is given of the foreign newspapers financed from Moscow, and Appendix 0 in which there is a list of the Bolshevik propaganda bureaux in foreign countries.f This point was subsequently developed at some length by Radek in his report upon English politics. The Bolsheviks, he said, bad brought the Eastern question to the fore not with any of the old imperialistic notions of territorial aggrandizement, but in order to demonstrate their vulnerable point to the British people. Thus their main aim was to help the Eastern races to free themselves from the tyranny of Great Britain. He considered that the success of this policy was now clearly proved, inasmuch as British statesmen realised the danger in the East and had consequently, in spite of all the inducements of the French, tried to avoid meddling in the internal affairs of Soviet Russia.to lecture on tlie new Russian culture. It then settled, down again to listen to Kerschenzow&apos;s report upon re voluntary propaganda abroad. This report is described as having been particularly interesting. It has certainly supplied valuable evidence as to the aims and working methods adopted by the Bolsheviks in foreign countries.* It is worth rioting that Kerscbenzow laid great emphasis upon the importance attached by the Bolsheviks to their propaganda in the East, especially in India, as in this way the Soviet Government was best able to bring pressure to bear upon Great Britain,fLosowsky in his report upon trade union questions upbraided the professional unions and complained that their leaders to-day only occupied themselves with matters of minor importance. He contended that communists must seek admittance to unions in order that every union might become a revolutionary factor in the class Avar. The Congress appointed a committee with a branch in every country to deal with the subject and Losowsky was empowered to devote his energies to the task of infusing Bolshevism into the trade union movement.Reports on the Progress of Bolshevism in Foreign Countries.Radek&apos;s report upon English politics does not appear to have con-tained any particularly sensational information. He made the usual charges of hypocrisy and treachery against the British Government. He suggested that while negotiating with the Soviet Government Great Britain was being influenced by France to give assistance to the Poles. He assured the Congress, however, that no direct action against Russia was to be expected from Great Britain as the British trade unions and working classes had determined that no such war should take place. The British Government realised that intervention on the side of the Poles would mean a revolution at home.Levai, in his report upon Hungary, explained that the communist republic had failed in Hungary because the cause was betrayed by the social democrats. He informed the Congress that all the Hungarian reactionaries could be bought at a price, but that so far the communists had not cared to expend the necessary money. His one hope was that the Hungarian army might be sent to help the Poles, because theu the Hungarian soldiers would come under the direct influence of the Russians. The Congress decided to spend large sums in fostering Bolshevism in Hungary ; to establish communist groups throughout the country ; to set up a secret printing press ; to do everything possible to intensify the prevailing hatred against the Hungarians ; to incite the population of Jugo-Slavia against the Hungarians.Paul Levi and Crispien both submitted reports upon the political situation in Germany. The former abused every political party in turn. He said that the Kapp putsch was not brought about by fear of Bolshevism and that, whilst it was in progress, the German national
party held &quot;ardent celebrations of victory.&quot; He maintained that the national parly ruled Germany. It had bought up all the leading news-papers and openly stood for the restoration of the monarchy. In Bavaria, immediately after the overthrow of the Uateregierung, attempts had been made to unite all the conservative parties. The centrum party was the stronghold of the counter-revolutionaries. The independent socialists were no better than the bourgeois parties, and in the revolution had meekly allowed themselves to be pushod aside instead of seizing the reins of government in conjunction with their communist comrades. He concluded his report by asserting that Crispieirs past was too shady to allow him to lead the revolution of the proletariat. Crispicn&apos;s report consisted of an apology for the action of the independent socialist party. The failure of the German revolution was due to the Entente, which threatened to strengthen the blockade and to starve the country unless order were restored. In exoneration of the somewhat pusillanimous policy which he admitted that the independents had adopted, he took the opportunity of reminding his Russian comrades that they had signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. He argued that, in spite of all the counter-revolutionary movements, the independent socialists had remained true to their revolutionary ideals and had resisted all the blandishments of the German people&apos;s party and of the social democrats to join forces with them. He then told the Congress that the German communists took matters very easily and left all the revolutionary spade work to the independent socialists. He concluded with a violent attack on the social democrats in general and upon Scheidermann in particular.After a long discussion upon the general situation in Germany, the Congress decided not to recognise the independent socialists, although it expressed its sympathetic feelings towards them.Frossard, in his report upon France, explained that the French socialists were still enthusiastic patriots and the servants of imperialism. In France the Bolshevik movement sprang not from social democracy, but from the anarchist and syndicalist movements. He said that the recent railway strike in France was not due to economic causes, but was designedly a political threat, and he assured his audience that so powerful and secret, was the organization of the Confederation Generate du Travail that it could effectively prevent the French Government from taking offensive action either against Germany or Russia.MacLean, who reported upon the situation in Great Britain, stated Mat English Bolshevism was carefully organized and that the English proletariat had become very revolutionary during the past few months. He thought it certain that Soviets would be established in Great Britain if they were set up in other countries besides Russia.Serrati, in his report on Italy, told the Congress that Italy was on ihe verge of a revolution ; that in most Italian towns the leaders of the Soviets had already been selected, and that the Italian Soviet Government would be extremely bellicose in favour of war against all non-goviet states,Marschlewski, the Polish reporter, after attacking the Entente for its cynical policy of sacrificing Poland in order to make that country a bulwark against Bolshevism, produced documents to prove that, even if Poland were not conquered by Russia, a Bolshevik revolution within the country was inevitable during the present year. He asserted that Radek would be appointed leader of the Polish Soviet.Toman, who made a report upon the situation in Austria, complained that Frederick Adler had completely betrayed the socialists. He said that in Austria the communist position was so bad that, unless the
country were encircled by other soviet governments, she would never become Bolshevik.Emma Goldman, the American reporter, after informing the Congress that the capitalists of the United States had not taken part in the great Avar in the interests of humanity, and indulging in a few sarcastic remarks at the expense of President Wilson, stated that both in the United States and in South America the Bolshevik movement was groAving.0After Hugo Sonnenschein, the reporter from Czecho-Slovakia, had told the Congress that the Czecho-Slovakians would not co-operate Avith the Entente in defeuce of Poland, and that they Avere only too ready to fight the Hungarians, BalabanoAva spoke on the subject of the social democrat international. She considered that the international social democrats Avere in the first degree responsible for the world war. They Avere patriots who had betrayed the proletariat. They had placed their services at the disposal of imperialist States. They should be attacked more vigorously even than the bourgeoisie. The Congress thereupon resolved to abstain from any intercourse with the international social democrats.Work in Committees of the Congress.The Congress having listened to these reports resolved itself into a series of committees which Avere empowered to draft resolutions upon the main points laid down for discussion on the agenda.f The following are some of the principal matters Avhich were discussed r (1) The part to be played by the communist party in proletarian revolution, both before and after the seizure of power by the proletariat.(2) Parliamentarism.(3) Professional trade unionism.(4) National and colonial questions.(5) Agrarian questions.(6) Conditions for admission to the Third International. (7) Regulations in regard to the organization of young people and women.!(8) The international situation and the Avork of the Communist International.There appears to have been considerable difference of opinion among the delegates as to the necessity for the complete dictatorship of the Moscow authorities over the communist party throughout the world. The British and Spanish representatives demanded that they should be allowed freedom of action in their own countries. Lenin and Trotsky, who Avere both called in to overcome their opposition, urged that it was exactly this local independence which had brought about the downfall* Later on in one of the committees of the Congress the American communist Keed spoke at considerable length on the subject of the negro movement in the United States. He assured hi3 hearers that communist propaganda would have tremendous effect among the negroes ; that the one aim of revolutionaries must be to unite in common union the black and white labouring classes both in the northern and southern states ; that this policy would alone break down the colour prejudice. Praia, who followed Reed, considered that the communist movement in the United States must co-operate in the revolutionary movement in Latin America. The destruction of American imperialism could only be effected by a revolution extending over the whole continent.f See Appendix (D.) for a list of the committees and of the delegates serving on them.\ In spite of the protests of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, the discussion on this subject did not take place.
of the Second International. They argued that a class revolution implied civil war and that for success in war iron discipline was required.* After considerable discussion, the Bolshevik leaders gained their way and a series of resolutions were adopted by the Congress, setting forth in clear and unmistakable terms its conception of the future role of international communism.&quot; The communist party is a party of the labour class. It is the political organization by which  the more awakened part of  the   proletariat directs the proletarian and half proletarian  masses along  the only possible path.   .   .   .   The struggle for proletarian dictatorship has erected a new type of political party, the communist party, and the communist international strongly denies the assertion that the proletariat will be able to carry out its revolution without the aid of its own political party    .   .   .   political power cannot be seized, organized and directed except by some political party   .   .   .   the class struggle renders it necessary that the different forms of tho labour movement (professional unions, co-operative organizations, factory committees, cultural educational institutions) should be united under and directed by a central authority . . . intensive propaganda is required in order that the successive stages of the revolutionary struggle may be made clear to the proletariat from the single point of view, and its attention directed to the common taskst   .   .   .   the labour classes cannot gain the victory over the bourgeoisie by means only of general strikes   .   .   .   they must resort to an armed uprising   .   .   .   the most important task therefore of the real communist party is to keep itself in close touch with the working masses   .   .   .   this implies  that communists  must work in other political organizations besides their ownf   .   .   .   they should even carry on their work through associations of a reactionary character^ .  .  . the old classical division of the labour movement into three distinct branches, political, professional   and  co-operative,  has  outlived   its usefulness and the proletarian revolution in Russia has established in the soviet system the basic principles for a labour dictatorship.   In the immediate future, therefore, the labour movement will be organized in three groups, (1) political, (2) Soviets, and (3) professional unions, but the two latter groups will be permanently and systematically under the direction of the political leaders of the communist party.&quot;Thus the organized advanced guard of the labour class will control the political, the economic and the cultural educational revolutionary forces in the class struggle ... the necessity for a political party will only cease after the complete victory of communism and the total abolition of classes . . . during the struggle the experience of Russia has shown that a complete centralization of power, a strict discipline and a full brotherly confidence on the part of all party organizations in the leaders of the party are essential to success . . . the international communist party must be built up, therefore, on the principle of democratic centralism which implies the choice of the higher command by the subordinate branches and then the strict execution by* The substance of the speeches delivered by Lenin and Trotsky on this occasion were published in an article signed by Ossinsky in &quot; Pravda,&quot; 25th July 1920.i The resolution on the subject of propaganda definitely states that the propaganda of the revolutionary syndicalists and the I.W.W. &quot;in opposition to an independent labour party only pleases and assists the interests of the bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionary social democrats ... all kinds of &apos; yellow labourists &apos; in tingland and America, carrying out the bourgeois policy, spread their propaganda among labourers with a view to the establishment of formless labour unions or- other legal parliamentary unions, instead of a real proletarian political party.&quot;i e.g., &quot; The Hands off Russia&quot; organization in Great Britain.$ e.g., &quot; Yellow unions,&quot; &quot; peasant unions.&quot;
(lie subordinates of the orders given by their leaders ... any propaganda for local autonomy at the present time can only weaken the communist party ... in countries where the bourgeoisie is still in power or in which the counter-revolutionary social democratic party continues to exist the communist party must use every means, legal or illegal, in its revolutionary policy. But communists who are members of the parliamentary or local bodies in such countries must be wholly and absolutely controlled by the communist party, regardless of whether or not the party is supposed to be a legal organization .... the fundamental basis of the communist political programme must be the creation of communist groups in any organization of proletarians, whether in towns or in agricultural districts.&quot;In the discussion on parliamentarism which followed the drafting of those resolutions, the question of whether or not communists should enter the parliaments of bourgeois states was fully debated. Bucbarin seems to have convinced the delegates that the anti-parliamentary policy of the I.W. W. of America and of other extremist organizations was a mistaken one. His contention was that the best way to break down an existing constitution was to attack it from within and con-sequently that revolutionaries should make a point of obtaining seats in parliaments and all other bourgeois assemblies/The important question of extending the influence of communism over trade unions then occupied the attention of the delegates. Iiadek presented a long report on the subject, and the British and American delegates appear to have taken a leading part in the discussion. It is stated by the Bolsheviks that only small differences of opinion arose and that these were due more to matters of detail in the working out of tho particular policy to be adopted than to matters of principle. It is clear, however, that, the resolutions giving directions to communists as to the manner in which propaganda work was to be carried out among members of professional unions were adopted against the wishes of the British and American delegates, who expressed a desire for further discussion on the subject, and that the decision that the communists in Great Britain should enter the labour party was not entirely satisfactory to some of the British extremists.!   The delegates of the I.W.W. even* &quot; That this theory (the policy of boycotting Parliaments) is quite wrong is &quot; illustrated by the fact that in a number of countries the seizure of the power by &quot; Soviets is not yet ready of accomplishment because the conditions preparatory to &quot; such a seizure have not yet quite been brought about. Under such conditions we &quot; must effect our entrance to the parliament in order to disrupt it from the interior.&quot; Extract from the speech delivered by Bucharin, &quot; Pravda,&quot; 3rd of August 1920.f This was made evident at the beginning of the final sitting of the Congress, when there was a spirited debate in which Comrades Sylvia Pankhurst and Gallagher protested strongly against the communists in Great Britain being asked to join the labour party. The former asserted that such a policy was futile because it was impossible to change the bureaucratic aloofness and conservative spirit; of the leaders of organized labour in England, while the latter urged that it was absolutely necessary to have a distinct communist party if the British working man was to be fired with the revolutionary spirit. Comrade McLean, on the other hand,, main-tained that organized trade unionism in Great Britain was steadily moving to the left, and that the infiltration of communists into the labour organization could but hasten this inclination. Lenin, after congratulating Comrades Pankhurst and Gallagher on their revolutionary ardour, rather cruelly pointed out that neither of them had been successful in creating a political party in Great Britain. He strongly advocated the policy of communists entering the labour party. The decision to adopt this policy was carried by 48 to 24 votes, two delegates abstaining from voting.
went further and emphatically announced their refusal to have any dealings with the old trade unions/The debate on colonial and national questions, which seems to have aroused considerable interest, was marked by a long speech by Lenin. He stated that capitalist rule in all colonies would be overcome if only the all-powerful proletariat would carry on its propaganda among the oppressed natives ; but he was unable to state exactly what measures the communists proposed to adopt in order to induce the proletariat to take the necessary action.f However, he assured his audience that time and experience would show them clearly the kind of policy most likely to gain their ends, and that meanwhile the soviet idea must be utilized everywhere and adapted to local conditions. There was an unlimited field for propaganda. A resolution was carried to the effect that the capitalist regime in Europe and in the United States of America would be crushed at once if the various countries were to lose their colonial possessions, in view of the fact that the colonies supplied the home governments with large revenues.The discussion upon agrarian questions, which took place on the 4th August, elicited comparatively little debate ; the importance of propaganda among the agricultural classes had already been agreed upon, and at this sitting the Congress expressed its opinion that special atteu-tion should be given to the organization of Soviets and societies among the middle class peasants. It also decided that the property of wealthy peasants should be expropriated without compensation.The discussion on the conditions for admission to the Third Inter-national were long and apparently somewhat heated. Some of the delegates developed an unexpectedly critical attitude with regard to the Bolshevik proposals, and it took all the eloquence of Zinovieff to induce the Congress to pass the 21 resolutions, the effect of which it is believed will be &quot;the establishment of an international communist party possessed &quot; of an iron discipline, a clear and scientific programme, with strong &quot; revolutionary tactics. One proletariat, one party, in Russia, in &quot; America, in France, and in the East.&quot;The Twenty-one Points.The following is a short summary of these resolutions which set out in more or less detail the conditions necessary for membership of the Third International as well as the aims and policy of the communist party :-(1) All propaganda and agitation must possess a real communist character. It must correspond with the programme and the decisions of the Third International. The press of the party must be edited by reliable communists, men who have given proofs of their allegiance to the cause of the proletariat. The party principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat must be explained in such a way that its necessity will be obvious to* An article published in &quot;Izvestia&quot; on the 5th of August 1920, after these discussions had taken place, announced the establishment of a temporary international soviet of professional trade unions. This body, which will include one representative from each country which belongs and adheres to the Third International, will make all the preparations necessary for the convention of an international congress of professional unions to be held in January 1921.t One of the British delegates, Quelch, told the Congress that the average British labouring man would consider it treasonable to assist in any way the natives of a colony to liberate themselves from the British yoke.
the simplest worker, soldier, and peasant. The entire party press and every publication of the party in any country must be absolutely subject to the party executive. In the press, at public meetings, in trades unions and co-operative societies, wherever followers of the Third International gain entry, not only the bourgeoisie but reformers of all kinds must be ruth-lessly branded.(2) Every organization which wishes to join the Communist Inter-national must remove &quot;reformist&quot; or &quot;centre&quot; followers from all responsible posts in the labour movement (party organisations, editorial staffs, trades unions, parliamentary parties, local unions, communal administrations) and must replace them by proved communists, even if it is necessary to replace &quot;experienced&apos;&apos; opportunists by simple workers from the masses.(3) Almost everywhere in Europe and America the class struggle has reached the stage of civil war. Communists must have no confidence in the legal system of the bourgeoisie. They must create an equally unlawful organization which at the decisive moment will help their party to fulfil its duty towards the revolution. In all countries where the communists, owing to martial laAV or exceptional legislation of any kind, cannot carry on their work legally, they must be ready to make use of illegal means.(4) In every bourgeois country there must be a systematic and energetic communist propaganda in the army. Failure by communists to engage in this work is equivalent to treason to revolutionary duty and the principles of the Third Inter-national.(5) A systematic and regular agitation must be carried on among the agricultural community. The industrial classes cannot win if they are not backed by the country proletariat. Communist work in the country districts must be carried on with the help of the revolutionary communist workmen in the towns who have connections with the peasants. To renounce this duty or to entrust it to the half-reformers is equivalent to a renunciation by the communists of the proletarian revolution.(6) Every party which wishes to belong to the Third International must denounce social patriotism and unmask the shams and hypocrisy of social pacifism. It must strive to make the working classes see that without the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalists no international arbitration courts, no agree-menta for the limitation of armaments, no &quot; democratic&quot; renewals of the League of Nations can safeguard them from fresh imperialist wars.(7) All parties which wish to belong to the Communist International, must break entirely with the policy of the reform and &quot;centre &quot; party. This fact must be known and acknowledged by all members of such parties, for without such unity a logical communist policy is impossible.The Third International demands once and for all that this breach be carried into effect absolutely and in the shortest possible time. It cannot acquiesce in the fact that sucli notorious opportunists as Turati, Kautsky, Hilferding, Hill-guit, Longuet, Macdonald, Modigliani, &amp;c, and others, should have the right to be counted among its members.
(8) Every party which washes to belong to tho Third International must unmask the schemes and machinations of &quot;their&quot; imperialists in the colonies ; must support every movement for liberty in the colonies not only by words but with deeds ; must demand the expulsion of their imperialists who are settled in these colonies ; must cultivate in the hearts of tho workers of their own country a truly brotherly feeling towards the working population of the colonies ; and must propagate among the troops of their country a systematic agitation against every oppression of the colonial peoples.(9) Every party which wishes to belong to the Third International must develop systematically and steadily a communist activity in the trades unions, the workers and factory councils, co-operative societies and other mass organizations of the working class. Little communist circles must be organized within all such bodies which by their persevering and steady work will win the factories, &amp;c, for communism. Such communist circles must be entirely under the orders of the party.(10) Every party belonging to the Third International must carry on a determined war against the Amsterdam International of the &quot; yellow&quot; trade unionists. They must preach the emphatic necessity of a breach with the yellow Amsterdam International among the trade union workers. They must support by every means the nascent international union of the red trade unions which are joining the Third International.(11) Parties which belong to (he Third International must revise their membership ; must expel all untrustworthy members ; and must submit to the authority of the commuuist party. Every individual commuuist member of parliament must give his entire activities to the interests of true revolutionary propaganda and agitation.(12) The parties belonging to the Third International must be formed in accordance with the fundamental principles of democratic centralization. During the present period of intensified civil war the communist parties will only be iu a position to fulfil their duty if their organization is centralized as much as possible, if iron discipline is maintained, and if the central executive of the party is backed by the confidence of all the members and furnished with absolute authority and the widest powers.(13) The communist parties in countries in which the communist party carries on this work legally must from time to time purge the party organization in order to cleanse the party from the petty bourgeois elements which succeed in entering its organization.(14) Every party which -wishes to belong to the Third International must give ruthless assistance to every republic in its Avar against counter-reArolutionary forces. The communist parties must carry on an unequivocal campaign of propaganda to hinder the transport of munitions of war to the enemies of the soviet republic; further, they must by legal or illegal means carry on propaganda among the troops sent to crush work-men^ republics.(15) Parties which so far have held to their old social democratic programme must now at once alter this programme and adopt
a new communist programme in accordance with the spirit of the decisions of the Third International. As a rule the programme of every party belonging to the Third International must be confirmed by the regular congress of the Inter-national or its executive committee. In case of the non-confirmation of the programme of any party by the executive the party concerned has the right to appeal to the congress.(16) All decisions of the congress of the Third International as well as the decisions of its executive committee are binding on all parties belonging to the International. Owing to the fact that it is carrying on its work during intensified civil strife, the Third International must be much more centralized than was the case with the Second International.(17) Every party which wishes to belong to the Third International must style itself the communist party of the country to which it belongs (Section   of the Third International). This matter of title is a political question of the greatest importance. The Third International has declared war upon the whole bourgeois world, and upon all &quot; yellow&quot; social democratic parties, for every simple worker must be made to distinguish clearly between the communist parties and the old official social democratic and socialist parties which have betrayed the banner of the working classes.(18) The press organs of all parties belonging to the Third Inter-national must print all important documents issued by the executive of the International.(19) All parties which belong to the Third International, or which have applied to join it, must, as soon as possible (at latest within four mouths after the Second Congress of the Third International) apply for a special congress to examine all these conditions. In the meantime, the central body of the Inter-national must arrange that all local organizations are made acquainted with the decisions of the Second Congress.(20) Political parties which desire to enter the Third International, but the tactics of which do not conform with the programme of the International, must; before their admission, arrange that not less than two-thirds of the members of their central committee and of all their main directing bodies shall consist of comrades who, before the Second Congress, came forward publicly and unequivocally in favour of the entrance of the party into the Third International. Exceptions to this rule can only be allowed with the permission of the executive of the Third International.(21) Members of any party who definitely refuse the conditions and principles of the Third International must be expelled from any party which decides to belong to the International.Reasons  or, and Probable Effects of, the Moscow Decisions.There can be no doubt that the stringent purge which the Bolshevik leaders have succeeded in inducing their supporters to adopt for the communist party will profoundly affect the fortunes of all the progressive and socialist parties throughout the world.In Russia, Kalinin and other Bolshevik leaders seem anxious to make their foreign adherents believe that the main result of the Congress is that the responsibility for the success of the world revolution has now been taken out of Russian hands and given over to the international communists.   On paper this may appear to be the case, but, so long as
uthe world revolution is financed from Russia and has its headquarters in Moscow, it is tolerably clear that tho political control of the international communist party must remain with the Russian Soviet Government.The adoption of the 21 points by the Congress, therefore, can only mean that Lenin and his political friends have decided that the time has arrived to clear the issues and to rid themselves of doubtful supporters. Although this is a bold policy, it is from the Bolshevik standpoint a perfectly logical one, whilst it is entirely consistent with Leniu&apos;s declared views from the early days of the Russian revolution. He has always insisted that the Soviets of the proletariat must be supreme, that there must be no question of compromise between the communists and the more moderate revolutionaries, that a new international must be organized to sweep away the &quot; unprincipled nebulotrsness and political servility&quot; of the &quot;lower middle class democrats.&quot;*In Russia this policy of &quot; Thorough &quot; has succeeded in establishing and maintaining in power the soviet system of government; it is now proposed to apply the same policy within the communist party throughout the world. The acceptance of the 21 points by any party must imply the absolute surrender of the moderates to the extremists. In the future there can bo only one party professing communist opinions in any country. Willtin that party, in order to prevent any moderate control, there must be no kind of proportional representation, and all the official posts in the party must be filled by proved communists, for it is laid down as a guiding rule that &quot; even workers of small education are to be &quot; chosen as leaders in preference to more educated persons who by birth &quot; belong to the bourgeoisie, and that all existing leaders who belong to &quot; the right wing are to be discarded.&quot;It is not surprising, therefore, that the twenty-one points are now exciting as much discussion among the socialist parties as Mr. Wilson&apos;s 11 points excited among the statesmen of Europe a short time ago.In Germany the independent socialists appear to be evenly divided with regard to the acceptance of the Bolshevik terms. It is reported that two of their four delegates to the congress are in favour and two against accepting them. In France, Cachin, editor of &quot; Humauite,&quot; the official organ of the socialist party, and Froissart, secretary of the party (both of whom went to the congress), are ready to accept the Bolshevik conditions, while Longuet, editor of &quot; Pupulaire,&quot; Paul Faure, and the main body of the Confederation Generale du Travail are reported to be opposed to them.fIn Italy the elder socialists, led by Turati, are against adhesion to the Third International and the executive of the Italian socialist party has decided upon their expulsion from the party4It is too early yet to judge how far the decisions of the Congress will affect the strength and independence of the various revolutionary move-ments now in existence. In view of the financial assistance which so many of these associations obtain directly or indirectly from the Bolsheviks, it seems probable that the majority of them will at any rate declare their acceptance of the 21 points. But it is difficult to understand how any international committee sitting in Moscow can succeed in setting up over the communists of Western Europe and America a political dictatorship such as exists in Soviet Russia.* Tvotsky&apos;s description of the moderates in Russia.f The Bolsheviks now suspect Longuet of being too conservative, and demand his exclusion from the socialist party.I This decision has led to the resignation of Serrati, editor of &quot;Avanti,&quot; not because be was opposed to the decisions of the Congress at Moscow, but because he objected to the expulsion of his friends from the party.
The Bolsheviks attribute that which they consider to be the failure of the Second International to its want of discipline not to any inherent weakness in the conception of internationalism as a political force.They would possibly be nearer the truth if they ascribed the comparative ineffectiveness of the Second International to their own successes. In all revolutionary movements the extremists flourish at the expense of the moderates. Their doctrines make progress owing to the irresolution and uncertainty which too often characterize the policy of their more cautious rivals. Men who are prepared and determined to carry out their political programme in its entirety, and who stick at nothing to gain their ends, almost invariably gain the mastery over men whose views are open to compromise and whose methods are less violent. Thus, as M. Paul Milinkov has clearly pointed out,* the Bolsheviks have multiplied and prospered not so much by their own strength as by the weakness and inconsistency of their socialist antagonists within the sphere of doctrine shared by both. They have gained their power by the simplicity and consistency of their policy. Their opponents, instead of definitely repudiating the extremist doctrines of which they really disapproved have preferred, or thought it expedient, to resort to sophistic explanations which have been cleverly used by the Bolsheviks in their propaganda as convincing proofs of socialist hypocrisy and selfishness intended only to cheat the proletariat. The opening of the present campaign against the adherents of the Second International and the declared determination of Lenin and his adherents to make use of the organization of trade unionism and the political machinery of the labour parties to help them in /setting up a communist dictatorship on the Russian model throughout the world, ought to make the more moderate reformers realize that their very existence is in danger.&quot;)&quot; It is iioav a death struggle between communism as understood in Moscow and social reform as it is generally conceived in Western Europe, the British Dominions and the United States of America. Everywhere the extremist agitation, directed not so much against capitalism (in the first instance at any rate) as against orthodox socialism, is being set in motion, and, although the control which is exercised over their folloAvers by socialist leaders in general, and the leaders of organized trade unionism in particular, may not always be so complete as they may desire, it would yet be doing them an injustice to suppose that they will be willing tamely to surrender their independence to any international coterie of extremists sitting in Moscow and blindly obeying the orders of the Russian Soviet Government.* &quot;Bolshevism: An International Danger,&quot; by Paul Milinkov, L.L.D., London : George Allen and Unwin, Ltd.f In a speech delivered at one of the final meetings of the Congress, Lenin expressed his policy quite clearly. He was trying to persuade certain British dele-gates that the policy of communists entering moderate political parties was advisable : -&quot;One of the arguments against the union of the communist party with the labour &quot; party (in Great Britain) is that one political party cannot enter another, especially &quot; one that belongs to the Second International. But the fact &quot;is that the labour &quot; party whose leaders are the most reactionary social traitors, worse even than the &quot; Scheidermann party with which are linked 4,000,000 members of professional &quot; unions, gives sufficient freedom of criticism and activity to all organizations which &quot; enter its ranks,&quot;
