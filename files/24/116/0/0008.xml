H i p^fe^^y the Secretary of State for India with reference to the telegram ---^-gf the       November which has already been circulated. (CP. 2164.)SECRET.Telegram jrom Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,2nd November 1920.Please refer to secret report from Constantinople dated 12th August 1920, regarding possibility of either Prince Abdul Majid, or Amir of Afghanistan, or Sheikh Senussi, being elected Khalif in place of Sultan, who is considered passive instrument in the hands of Allies ; also to your telegram of 14th October, 2550, repeating unconfirmed report that Mustapha Kemal had addressed King Hussain as Khalif. Subsequent reports have shown that Unionist section of Turkish Nationalists, who under Bolshevik influence are seriously (? considering) election of new Khalif, are gaining ground (? and) possibility of Amir (? being) elected can no longer (? be) neglected. It seems possible that Jemal Pasha, who is about to reach Kabul under wing of Bolsheviks, may be bearer of some message (? on this subject), and we believe that bitterness of Indian Moslem extremists like Shaukat All is such that they would accept Amir&apos;s election. Information regarding foregoing Unionist plans has recently been published in Amritsar Mohammedan news-paper Vakil and has so far elicited no protest in India. We need not point out the grave situation for India which might be brought about by Amir&apos;s election, and it seems desirable to take any steps possible to avert this. Measures most likely to be successful seem to us to be amendment of (? Turkish) treaty before ratification, so as to retain nominal suzerainty of Sultan over whole pre-war (? Turkish) Empire in Asia, or at least over territories containing holy places of Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, Damascus, and Baghdad. (? This would) cut ground from under the feet of Unionists, as they could no longer (? logically) argue that Sultan has no connection with holy places and must be deposed from Caliphate for that reason, while it would greatly sooth moderate Moslem feeling. When we last pressed for this measure, danger of election of Amir as Khalif had not become question of practical politics, nor had Arab races turned against us and begun coquetting with Turkish parties, as they now seem to be doing. While, therefore, necessity for maintaining prestige of Sultan as existing Khalif has become greater, argument based on (? our) pledge of independence to the Arabs has weakened, and in any case nominal suzerainty of Sultan would not really diminish Arab independence. We have emphasised aspect of case as regards possible candidature of Amir, as this is most immediate potential danger to India, and we beg that His Majesty&apos;s Government will consider our proposal again in the light of new circumstances which have arised.2838-1     100 12.20
