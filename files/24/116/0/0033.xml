%\ S. Ac^IS 330CUMENT IS THE PK0PEi2)Y of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVBRJWNO?).CABIBBI .mmmim by the mbiistee o$ i.abouk.5. I need make no apology for reminding the cabinet of the increasing gravity of the Unemployment problem, although muoh has been done, I am bound to say that the present arrangements are inadequate to meet the situation with which we are already confronted, to oay nothing of the situaticn with which we certainly shall be confronted.The cabinet will remember that at the urgent   instance of the Minister of Health and myself, a cabinet committee upen Unemployment was set up in August last under the Chairmanship of Sir laming worthington Evans.    This Committee included, among other members, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Health and the Minister of labour, its constitution thus recognising that the ministerial responsibility for dealing with Unempley-ment is.not vested in any one Minister of the crown-    Muoh ground has been covered by the Committee and I recognise to the .. full tho olose and earnest attention that has been given to the matter by my colleagues on the committee.But in my Judgment the co-ordinating function discharged by this Committee cannot stop at the consideration and approval of the general emergency schemes for dealing with an emergency situation.    Some machinery is required, and required at onoe, to implement the schemes when arproved*/although
Although, as I have said, the ministerial responsibility for dealing with the problem of Unemployment does not rest with the Minister of labour alone, yet in practice he is the Minister to whom the unemployed throughout the country look for assistance and help *    You oannot expeot hungry men to appreciate the nioe division of constitutional functions between one Minister of the Crown and another; and the fact that the Minister of labour Is responsible for the oontrol of the Employment Exchanges throughout tho country, for the administration of the Unemployment Insurance Aots, and for redeeming the pledgc^given by the Government to ex-Service men generally, does in praotioe result in the Minister of labour having placed upon him a public responsibility which is not commensurate with the limited authority which in fact he possesses.What in my judgment is required., and required immediately, is the appointment of a Departmental Unemployment Committee upon which should be represented the appropriate Departments,   She duty of such a Committee should be to follow up day by day the progress made upon tho various emergency schemes approved by the Cabinet, and to relate   day by day the progress of these schemes to the growing volume of Unemployment.In all the circumstances I would suggest that it would be convenient for this committee to meet daily at the Ministry of labour, and I would myself undertake to keep in continuous personal touch with the Committee and to preside at its daily meetings, so long as the emergency remains.In the ordinary way, I should have preferred to put this proposition in the first instanoe to the cabinet Unemployment Committee, but in view of the discussion at next Monday^ meeting of the full Cabinet, I am anxious that my colleagues should have this suggestion in their minds.(Initd,)Ministry of labour,December 4th, 1920,
