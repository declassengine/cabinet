This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.CP. 2217. 0THE CABINET.SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith a letter from Lieut.-General Sir J. A. L. Haldane, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, to the Under Secretary of State for War, on the present position in that country.w. s. aThe War Office,2nd December, 1920.My dear Peel,Thank you for your letter and what you have done and say about the question of pay and allowances.The situation, as will have appeared from my recent telegram, is a good deal easier. The period of negotiations, under all circumstances apt to be lengthy, is approaching. If one tried to hurry on their conclusion or displayed a desire to get our terms accepted at once, the final result would only be retarded. The Arab is cunning, but not as a rule clever, and political officers, whom one might expect to understand the workings of his mind, are constantly at fault in their predictions as to what he may be expected to do. Just as I was starting for Persia on 5th June, the Civil Commissioner, who had been to Hillah the day before and had seen the leading sheikhs, told me that there was no chance of trouble in that area for six months. It broke out three weeks later. Miss Gertrude Bell wrote to,me on 30th June that the horizon was unclouded, and that the country gave every evidence of settling down. On that very date the trouble began at Rumaithah. One of my greatest difficulties here has been to decide whether or not to yield to the very pressing demands from Political Officers for troops to be sent hither and thither in order to save a situation and prevent the further spread of the insurrection. It has been difficult, more especially at first when one did not know the temperament of the men making the demands, to decide rightly. The affair in which the Manchester Regiment had heavy losses was brought about by such pressure, but there were too many obvious military reasons for not giving way to it that I can find no excuse for those concerned. My papers on this subject will be sent home shortly. Yes, I have had an anxious time, far Exceeding anything experienced in France and Belgium, where it was bad enough at times. At one time, and indeed for some weeks, our position was precarious and we might have been within an ace of losing Mesopotamia. The country was unprepared for the military situation created by the rising and it took time to catch up the lost ground. I had seen on my arrival that defences were made at all out-stations, and supplies within reason placed at them, but had the Arabs either at once or during the first weeks of the rising chosen to put themselves, well entrenched, across all the five railways which run into Baghdad, I should not have been able to move troops from outside the points held by them, in sufficient strength, to break down the resistance. I know it is imagined at home that the Tigris and Euphrates are sure lines of communication. The former, when the river is highi is a good enough but lengthy line, but in any and especially this year it is, during low water, overlooked by banks which are 15 to 20 feet above the stream. Thus, to protect vessels, troops would have to be placed on the banks, unless barges, &amp;c, were armed and bullet proof. When I ordered the defence vessels to be mobilized I was not aware that they were not bullet proof, and a little affair we had one day near Baghdad showed that the gun shields were also penetrable! In fact, in low water between Kut and Baghdad, the river for military purposes may be ruled out.   The Euphrates may likewise, at all.(B20/474)   100  12/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8729wo
seasons, be disregarded as a line of communication except for small boats and its palm-grown sides make it very unsafe as they give the enemy such good cover. Until I could get some blockhousing done and had stripped the Baghdad Shergat (extension) line of troops leaving some two companies of infantry only to guard 200 miles of railway, my position was a serious one. The Arabs learned under Lawrence to damage railways and have clone so to good effect here. Moreover, the railways, except the German line from Baghdad to Shergat, which has fort-like stations with wells and strongly made bridges, are merely rails on sleepers laid on the plain and they and the bridges, which are mostly temporary constructions, are easily damaged. I spent a trying ten days when my last reserve was making its way back to Hillah from Diwaniyeh after the relief of Eumaithah. The railway, which they were obliged to follow, in order to get back sick, wounded, and ammunition, was torn up nightly for miles ahead of the column. The value of time is not always appreciated east of Suez and in this case was not, or the Commander of the column would not have had to overcome almost insuperable difficulties. The troops could have moved a few days earlier before the Arabs had realized how they could delay the march.I have come to the conclusion that the distribution of the garrison here might have been better. I do not mean that there could have been any marked or immediate change on my arrival, for the matter required a knowledge of the country and the people which I did not possess. The distribution was, I believe, based on that of the Turks, and was more administrative than strategic. I learned after a time that the question of water for cultivation was a dominant one, and spoke to the Civil Commissioner on the subject, suggesting that certain places, such as the Hindiyeh Barrage, should be held.I realize now that the key to controlling this country is to control the water regulators. These held, and they can be ;*added to a question which my chief engineer is going into I think, it would be possible gradually to disarm the country. The Arabs must be disarmed, whether we or an Arab Army hold it, otherwise we are at their mercy to a great extent. I am avoiding in the terms of submission any definite pronouncement on the subject lest other tribes, who are not hostile, might resent the idea and rise ; and moreover water control must first be secured. There will be difficulties with the Nomad tribes and Khurds, but they can be overcome.You will probably have felt at home that my operations are slow, and that I have had no decisive success. I admit that they are slow, but that was unavoidable for many reasons which 1 will not here enter into. Decisive success means that the enemy stands to fight, or that by stratagem or holding something which is of vital importance to him, you make him fight. The Arabs will not stand, and I have tried to lure them to fight by seizing some water controls and cutting off the main supply to Kerbela. So far this action has had no marked results. As regards stratagem, for that purpose mobility and highly trained troops are essential. I have neither, and I have, moreover, no miniature Hannibals under my command ; indeed I am forced unwillingly to approve of far more use of guns being made than I should like. They are spoil-sports against semi-savages and yet are essential to back up the kind of units I have here; and those now arriving from India will be less reliable.Could I have continued operating in the Hillah area, which from a military point of view, would have been correct, I might have brought the recalcitrant tribes there to their senses. The presence of the married families in Persia, where I was threatened with a rising of Khurds in sympathy with those who had risen within our own borders, compelled me to open the Persian line. My troops in Persia were well supplied and could have carried on for some months. I may mention that the deliberate methods which local conditions and the slow arrival of reinforcements forced upon me, have not been without effect on the Arab mentality. I foresaw that in the case of the brick blockhouses round Baghdad, the inhabitants would quickly realize that there was no thought of a scuttle policy. The extremists, helped from Syria, thought to turn us out by cutting off garrisons as they had done there; and blockhouses on railways and elsewhere showed them that we meant to stay. The main operation I have in view now is to relieve Samawah, and I have sent my best Brigadier to command the actual relief column, and given him the pick of the latest troops from India.To the possible delay of operations near Baghdad, I am keeping three battalions at Basrah in case they might be required. They would form part of the relief force as a reserve brigade in any country where there was plenty of water, but the relief force will have, during part of its march, to be watered animals and all from tanks on a train.
I am afraid that one cannot escape the facts that this country can&apos;t be kept quiet without a strong garrison. Cox will not be able to alter that fact &quot; charm he never so wisely.&quot; The Arabs say so themselves and the townsmen dread a weakening. The Arab, according to one of his proverbs, &quot;has his brains in his eyes&quot; or seeing is believing. It was the speedy demobilization and the fact that we had never shown force north of Samawah, that encouraged him to try a throw with us. Once disarmed he will be much less troublesome and would take a long time to re-arm, but until then and until a reliable local force is started, we must have troops on the ground, Mr. Levy has done well in several instances, and if Arab-speaking British officers can be procured, good progress could quickly be made in augmenting the force. I am strongly in favour of mechanical instruments as a means towards reducing the garrison and have enquired about tanks. I have never faltered in my allegiance to the tank since I saw the wooden model, in secret, near Willesden in 1915. An expert should visit this country as the articles required here would probably be somewhat different from what we had in France.A. HALDANE.25th September, 1920.MMCIffl
