MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.LIMITATION OP GOVEKHMSHT CONTRACTS to cabinet.PIRMS OH mi lilies IJATIOIIAL ROLL.SACHET.IJiXM&amp;S. MEMORANDUM  BY  MINISTER   Qg   LA3QOK.The limitation of Government oontracts to firms on the King1b National Roll has been recommended hy the Ex-Service Men!e Committee, representing Employers, Trade Unionists, ibc-Service Men Organisations and the Ministry of Labour, intheir Report of lath August, 19SO (see Omd 951 paragraph 17), and by the Select Committee on Pensions in their Report of 9th August, 1920 (see Parliamentary Paper Po.185 Paragraphs 14, 18 and 2 ).Thero iB, I believe, a general concensus of opinion infavour of this limitation among those who have the interests of disabled e::-Servioe men at heart, and I think that - subject to certain neoessary exceptions where essential supplies oan only be secured from firms employing a vory small number of employees - such a limitation of Government contracts toast now be adopted.A preference in favour of firms on the Eing^b Roll has been given during the last few months, but as this preference only operates in oases whore tenders are egual or substantially so, it is of little practical importance.It is not a valid objection to say that the cost of Government contracts may he inoreased.   The Fair Wages Clause4Js tmppsed in spite of this obvious tendency to increase.the cost, and it can hardly be said that the obligation of every employer to place his name on the King^s Roll is one to whioh less importance Bhould be attached than that of observing the
m3i1air Wages Clause.    By putting his namo on the Roll the employer definitely shoulders en additional financial obliga-tion for tho benefit of disabled ox-Service men and the Government, which through the Minister of labour urges all employers to assume that obligation, cannot with any consist-ency tako advantage of a lowor price asked for by some other employer who has not assumed tho obligation.In practice tho limitation of Government contracts to firms on the King&apos;s Koll would probably not increase the cost to any appreciable extent, because the effect would be that the great majority of Government contractors would come on the Ho11.There is no reason why any firm employing more than a few workpeople should not cone on the Roll,   The normal condition of qualification is tho employment of at least 5$ of disablod men, &quot;but this percentage may he and is reduoed so far as necessary either for a whole trade or for particular establishments if good reason is shown.The number of firms on tho Roll at present is  2,700 employing altogether 3,800,000 workpeople. A period of (say) one month should be allowed after the announcement of the proposed limitation of oontraots before it comes into aotual effect, and during this interval i have no doubt that all Government oontraotors of any importance will come on the Boll.i am most anxious to secure the early adoption of this proposal in the interests of the disabled mr,n.   It would enormously strengthen the King&apos;a Boll whioh is the chief and almost the only security which the disabled nan has, not only for being taken into employment, but also against being the first to be discharged when staffs have to bp reduoed. If Government oontraots are limited as 1 suggest i propose to*X    2    mi
asx Looal Authorities all over the country.to adopt a similar limitation for their own contracts;   some have clone so already, but until the Government set an example I cannot bring any effective pressure to bear upon thorn,I accordingly reoommend that, from a date one month later than that of tho announcement, Government contracts should bo limited to firms on the King1s Roll, with suoh exceptions (to bo limited as narrowly as possible) as may be essential for the practical working&apos; of the proposal.(Intd)   I. J. M.December 7th 19S0,Ministry of labour.
