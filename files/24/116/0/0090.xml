(P 8761)From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 10th December 1920.(Received 1.1th, 10 a.m.)Clear the Hue.1410 S. Your telegram of 8th December,- 3880.&apos; Afghanistan. We regret we have not secured whole-hearted support of His Majesty&apos;s Government to policy which we have urged, but, after full consideration of arguments advanced in your telegram, we have decided to act on permission which you have given us to accept Amir&apos;s invitation. The risk of humiliation and possibility of danger to Mission were dealt with in our telegram of the 15th October last, 1201 S. Possibility of its being necessary to leave Kabul without Treaty has throughout been contemplated, and Mr. Dobbs will be authorised by us to leave Kabul at any time should he consider that dignity of British Government requires it.   I am addressing Amir as follows : &quot; I.F.O.C.C. 1906. I have received with pleasure your letter of the 24th Aqrab 1299 Shamsi corresponding to 16th November 1920, and am gratified at friendly sentiments contained in it.&quot; I note your assurance that any agreements into which Afghan Government may have entered or may enter with the Soviet Government rest only on such foundation(s) as will in no way disturb lawful rights of the British Government, and also that the matter of Russian Consulates Kandahar, Ghazni, has not yet been formally and finally arranged. .1 was very glad to receive these assurances, since, as 1 wrote to you in my former letter, the conclusion of any agreement with Bolsheviks, designed directly or indirectly against Great Britain, would render conclusion of a friendship treaty between Great Britain and Afghanistan impossible. Although you have not furnished (? me omitted) in specific detail with the full information for which I had asked ; nevertheless, accepting these, your assurance and the friendly terms in.which your letter is worded, I have obtained from His Majesty&apos;s Government their sanction to acceptance of your invitation to send a Mission to Kabul, in the hope that, after -arriving at an understanding, the conclusion of a treaty of friendship may be arranged. With regard to Waziristan, the tribesmen have already professed, submission to lenient terms announced, and 1 hope that they will make their profession,good, and so avoid chastisement, which otherwise they must undergo.&quot;The Mission will consist of Mr. 11. R. C. Dobbs, my Foreign Secretary, as chief representative, Mr. S. E. Pears (who has been recalled from England, and may arrive a little late), Nawab Sir Shams Shah, Lieut.-Col. Muspratt, and Mr. Acheson as members. There will also be a medical officer and personal assistant, with clerks and followers, whose numbers will be kept as low as possible.&quot;In addition to officers mentioned, (corrupt group) approximately 9 clerks and wireless operators, some 30 servants (? and) menials. 1 much regret it is not possible to (? keep) number of the party as low as 20.&quot;It is hoped it will be possible for the Mission to leave Peshawar about 23rd. December, but the precise date of starting will be communicated in good time by telephone from Peshawar.&quot;I trust that despatch of my Mission to your capital may lead to happiest results for both our countries, and may firmly establish the permanent friendship between us which we both so much desire.&quot;Communique which we are issuing follows in separate telegram.End of I.F.O.C.C. 1906.
