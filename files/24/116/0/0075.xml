This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.)(   CP,   5.57 3THE CABINET.THE SITUATION IN MESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB WAR.I circulate the enclosed memorandum on the Situation in Mesopotamia by General Radcliffe, the Director of Military Operations. This memorandum is concurred in by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.I ask that this paper shall receive consideration by the Cabinet, if possible, on Monday. I have to introduce the Supplementary Army Estimates on Wednesday, and it will be necessary to review the entire situation in Mesopotamia.W. S. C.The War Office,10 A December, 1920.1. General Haldanes telegram No. X 767 (Appendix A), of 28th November,     02 reviewing the situation in Mesopotamia and Persia asks for a clear statement of the     35 policy to which his troops are to give effect, and adds a serious warning as to the danger     107 of precipitous and premature reductions in the strength of the British garrison.2. The British forces in Mesopotamia and Persia at the present time amount to 17,000 British and 85,000 Indian troops, the annual cost of which to the British taxpayer is well over 30,000,000/.This force includes the reinforcements approximately equal to two divisions sent from India during the recent emergency, prior to which the garrison comprised 13,000 British and 67,000 Indian troops, costing 24,000,000/. annually.The latter strength has always been considered by the General Staff as the minimum required to control the vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, and to maintain the existing forces in North-West Persia. This view was consistently maintained during the early part of the year when great pressure was being brought to bear on the military authorities to reduce the garrison below this figure, while at the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government was unwilling to relinquish control of any portion of the three vilayets above mentioned, or to withdraw from North-West Persia.3. This conflict of views led to a situation which whatever its aspect from the point of view of the taxpayer was as regards the. Army equivocal and unfair. For in Estimates, 1920-21, only enough money was taken for half the necessary garrison for a whole year or, alternatively, for the whole force for six months&apos;only; the intention being to ask for a Supplementary Estimate in six months time, should the views of the General Staff have proved correct, and it had been found impracticable to reduce the garrison in the interim.That the estimate of the General Staff was not an exaggerated one has been amply proved by the events of this summer and autumn. On the contrary, it is clear that we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided, thanks to the energy, courage and devotion of the British soldier and his Indian comrade.4. This uncertain and questionable policy has resulted in great hardship to the troops, for whom no proper provision has been made in the way of cantonments on the plea that the occupation was only temporary.   They have consequently been exposed m indefinitely to one of the most trying climates in the world, with no better protectionthan tents or the flimsiest of hutments. Separated for long periods from their families, they have lacked all the ordinary amenities of life and that reasonable(B20/5021   100  12/20  H&amp;S, Ltd.  8792wo
2standard of comfort which is necessary for the maintenance of contentment and discipline in the Army. All this, quite apart from the extremely arduous and trying conditions (such as a temperature of 120 degrees) under whioh operations for the suppression of the Arab revolt have been carried out. As to these, which are recognized as inseparable from the necessities of active service, not a word of complaint has been or is likely to be heard. But the General Staff&apos;would be failing in its duty&apos;if it did not insist on adequate provision being made without Further delay for the garrison considered necessary to maintain order in the country, as long as it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to hold it.o. In this connection I wish to point out that, whatever the reasons for our occupation of Mesopotamia and Persia may be and the British taxpayer may be pardoned for wanting to know what he is getting for his 20 or 30 millions a year it is not for any military reason that we are there. From the strategical point of view the only justification for the maintenance of military forces in Mesopotamia is the reason for which our original campaign there was initiated, namely to&quot; keep control of the Persian Gulf&quot; and to protect the Anglo-Persian Oilfields, which were, and are, vital to the Navy. This object would be effectively secured by the occupation of Basrah and the approximate line Ahwaz Kurna Nasirieh, which would require a force of approximately a division, costing some 8,000,000/!. annually.6. The idea of maintaining troops in Mesopotamia or Persia for the defence of India is radically unsound, and has never been contemplated by the General Staff. A mere fraction of the outlay at present involved by our Mesopotamian garrisons would be infinitely more effective in defending India if spent in the improvement of communica-tions on the North-West Frontier, and in the betterment of conditions of service in the Indian Army.On the other hand, our military position on the Tigris and Euphrates, and on the distant Persian plateaux, is thoroughly unsound, and must always be a potential cause of anxiety. Recent events have proved how precarious is the position of our scattered garrisons widely dispersed in response to political necessities at the end of long and vulnerable communications, without adequate reserves ready to strike promptly and quell trouble at the outset.7. And, in the late crisis, be it remembered, we had only to deal with internal risings, though undoubtedly these were partly instigated by external agency. In the future and by no means the remote future we may expect serious aggression from beyond the Northern and North-Eastern borders. With General Haldane&apos;s appreciation of the situation the General Staff is in complete agreement. On 9th February this year (121/3/1543, Appendix B) the General Staff repeated their warning as to the effect of the Governments Turkish policy on our military commitments. These warnings have already been amply justified by events. This same policy, which continues to antagonize the Turks, and with them the whole Mussulman community, is laying up for us fresh trouble in the coming spring, the shadow of which is clearly seen in the intrigues disclosed.by General Haldane&apos;s latest telegrams (No. X 767, Appendix A, of 20th November and No. X 788, Appendix C, of 1st December, 1920).This question has recently been dealt with in the General Staff Memoranda of 19th and 22nd November, 1920 (0152/5737), Appendices D and E, in connection with the Greek political crisis. Apparently, however, His Mcijesty&apos;s Government has decided to disregard the military aspect of the problem, and we must lay our plans on the basis of an irreconcilably hostile Turkey in league and in touch with the Soviet Government of Russia.8. From next May onwards, therefore, we must be prepared as General Haldane p dnts out-for a crisis which will tax the resources of even the present augmented garrison to the utmost. Should the development of Turkish aggression, in combination with the Kurdish tribes to the north of Mosul, synchronize with a Russian advance from Tabriz and Enzeli in North Persia, we shall be hard put to it to maintain our position, even if the tribes in the interior ot Mesopotamia keep quiet. A repetition of the Arab revolt at the same moment would be fraught with the gravest consequences.9. General Haldane is at present under orders to reduce his force by 1st April, 1921, to the same dimensions as it was before the reinforcements arrived from India last summer, and later to carry out still further reductions. We are, therefore, threatened with a recurrence of the unsound and unsatisfactory position with which we have had to contend during this year, and in the interests of the Army I most Jemphatically protest. I do not for one moment presume to criticise the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, either in maintaining troops- in Persia, in occupying
Mesopotamia, or in pursuing their present policy in regard to the Turkish Nationalists, for all of which measures there are doubtless good reasons, but I do maintain that the military liabilities entailed by this policy have got to be faced.10. Thfl British Army is at present undergoing a very critical period, being in the throes of reconstruction on a voluntary basis. It is immature, inexperienced, unseasoned, and has already been subjected to an undue strain in various parts of the world. It is our duty to see that it is not strained to a point at which its spirit may be broken.The situation, then, is this: Failing any modification of the Governments policy, money has got to be found for the existing garrison in Mesopotamia, Persia, &amp;c, up to at least the end of this financial year. If the situation develops unfavourably it may prove impossible to effect any substantial reductions below this total for an indefinite period. Apart from the financial burden thus entailed, a serious political question is involved in the continued retention of so many Indian troops outside India for other than Indian purposes.Under the most favourable circumstances, the minimum garrison required for Mesopotamia during 1921-22 will be the equivalent of three divisions and 6 cavalry regiments, or approximately 15.000 British and 65,500 Indian troops. This is on the assumption that the British forces have been withdrawn from North Persia, but unless the troops now in Persia can be withdrawn and added to the garrison of Mesopotamia, it will not be possible to continue the repatriation of the units now under orders to return to India by the 31st March, 1921. No practical relief can be expected from the local Arab Levies for a considerable time, as many months must elapse before they can materialize in sufficient numbers and mature in organization and efficiency.Conclusions.11. To sum up, the following situation has to be faced : (i.) The forces in North-West Persia must now remain there until the spring because climatic conditions make it impossible to withdraw them during the winter. This entails the occupation of the whole of the Mosul Vilayet as now held in order to safeguard the Persian Line of Communications.. Until the troops from Persia can be withdrawn and added to the Mesopotamian garrison, it will not be safe to send back to India any appreciable portion of the reinforcements recently sent from there.(ii.) In the spring of 1921, unless it is decided to withdraw from the Mosul and Baghdad Vilayets, the equivalent of three divisions and six cavalry regiments will be required to hold the country, exclusive of any troops in Persia. The cost of this garrison will&apos; be in the neighbourhood of 25,000,000?. per annum, to which must be added a considerable sum for necessary railway construction.(iii.) An alternative policy is to withdraw from North Persia, Mosul and Baghdad to a line covering Basrah and the Anglo-Persian Oilfields, for the defence of which about one division would suffice, at a cost not exceeding 8,000,000/. per annum. Whatever alternative is adopted, it cannot be too strongly urged that the provision of reasonably good accommodation and conditions of existence should be provided for the troops entailed. The cost of this is not included in the above estimates, and an early decision is necessary in order that arrangements may be made before the hot weather comes on.P. de B.

APPENDIX A.From General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Mesopotamia, to War Office..    Despatched 1140, 28th November, 1920. (No. X 767, cipher.) (received 29th, 2145.)Part 1. Hitherto, in advancing my views regarding question of reductions of British garrison in Mesopotamia, I have laid stress only on internal factors affecting the numbers requisite : (1.) Now to stamp out insurrection, establish Arab Government authority and effect disarmament and subsequently to maintain internal peace when established (?) later, figure is largely dependent on the efficacy of disarmament policy in practice and on progress in formation of intended Arab army and auxiliary force both of which no less than the reception by the country of the Provisional Arab Government and no doubt permanent successor, must remain uncertain quantities for some time to come.(2.) (?) Movements (?) already reported simultaneously with elimination of Wrangefs Army and over-running of area by the Turks have re(one group undecipherable)ed (two groups undecipherable) (?)new (?) extension of dangers, both on northern boundary of Mesopotamia and in Northern Persia. Lines of communication are opened before Turkish Nationalists and Bolsheviks, whose hands are now freed for eastern enterprises.Part 2. It is possible that as a result of recent elections trend of Greek policy in Asia Minor may change, and cessation of further Greek offensive action in Allied interests would relieve pressure on Nationalists and permit of their consolidation and the resuscitation of active designs for recovery at least of portion of territories which in pre-war days were integral provinces of Turkey.(3.) Turco-Bolshevik alliance is unnatural and by skilful policy and propaganda should be susceptible of disruption. At the same time enmity against Great Britain and Prance, common to Bolshevists and Nationalists, is of sufficient strength to (?) give alliance certain (group undecipherable) life. It, therefore, contains potentialities inimical to Persia, Mesopotamia and Syria which demand precautions.(4.) Persistent report of aggressive intentions against Mosul Vilayet already gives evidence of trend of Nationalist policy on northern border of Mesopotamia.Part 3. (5.) Documents of commission to incite anti-British activities of outlawed leaders in Telafar(? af), from Turkish official military quarters, (?) reported (?) con-spiracies and revelation of embryo plan from tribal raids into Mesopotamia territory with small nucleus of regular troops and artillery, give support to these. Distinct anti-British colour is also shown in recent changes in senior military commanders and civil officials in Jezireh group area. Effectives of units of Jezireh group are still little more than sufficient to maintain order in the area in their occupation ; their numbers have, however, increased appreciably, and intensive recruiting campaign is in progress, which would doubtless meet with some measure of success if backed by Bolshevik money. Raiding warfare under trained direction would be effective and difficult to cope with on the Baghdad Mosul Lines of Communication, and on lines connecting the Mosul with advanced posts, while the stirring up of Kurdish tribes (?) along (group undecipherable) north-eastern border to unrest, which is liable to assume grave proportions, requires only money, organization, and a handful of troops.Part 4. Disappointment of French regarding Mosul, their position on the flank in Cilicia and Syria and their active attempt to attract Assyrian and other Christians of Mosul Vilayet to their area and protection, leads to the supposition in this matter they may seek to protect their own interests without regard to ours.My task and responsibilities would be appreciably lightened if diplomacy can secure effective French co-operation.(6.) Conflicting territorial ambitions in North-West Persia will tend to embroil Turko-Bolshevik relations, but both are likely to initiate enterprises in Persian-Azerbaijan detrimental to interests and integrity to Persia while revolution in capital will be one of Bolshevik main objectives.Although lack of railways and difficulties of road transport will handicap them, possession of sea bases and availability of requisite troops, vehicles and fuel will give them power to concentrate considerable numbers and advance at short notice.
APPENDIX B.Extract from General Staff Memorandum (121/31543), dated 9th February, 1920.-ii. -V&apos; -V- J/. .1,TV YT TT . *fr *T&quot;3. It is considered that at the present time, and for many months to come, any attempt to hold Baghdad and the Line of Communication to Basra with the force . suggested * is to invite disaster.******Part 5. When ice of Northern Caspian breaks up in May this power (?) will be increased and no force that we can maintain in North-West Persia can hope to withstand serious military advance of Kasvin and Teheran in the event of their plan taking form. Bolshevik control of Baku Alexandropol Tabriz railway and branch to Sherifkhapa provides double threat of alternative line of advance on Kasvin and of movement on Mesopotamia via Urmi(? a) and Rowanduz.(7.) Any hostile operations on a large scale will be deferred by severe winter in Anatolia, Trans-Caucasia and North-West Persia until spring, 1921, when possibility of combined action in North-West Persia and on northern border of Mesopotamia must be kept in view. It is (?) also at this time, and not before, after harvest of winter crops, that it will appear whether or not Arab tribal unrest will break out, and minor outbreaks at least must be expected.(8.) May to July, 1921, therefore, may be a period of crisis involving (?) heavy call on troops for northern Mesopotamia front and Lines of Communication thereto.Part 6  It is possible that this may synchronize with hostile activities in Northern Persia on considerable scale, necessitating withdrawal of Norperforce, if withdrawal has not already taken place. In any case, spread of anarchy in,Persia would react on tribes in Mesopotamia and would demand military measures to prevent its penetration in form of organized forces. Even if French prevent trouble from Turkey and Syria (group undecipherable) reaching us via Upper Euphrates, it is inevitable that result of events in Persia and propaganda must stimulate (?) internal unrest in Mesopotamia at a season fertile for its growth.I therefore ask for clear statement of policy to which my troops are to give effect both in Mesopotamia and, perhaps, Persia, and urge in strong terms that precipitous reductions in strength of British garrison prior to July, 1921, would be premature and unwise if I am to be responsible for defence of present Mesopotamian frontiers against external aggression as well as maintain internal peace. I request that when question of reduction of force under my command is being considered these views may be borne in mind.Part 7. (9.) Orders have been issued suspending the repatriation of all Inland Water Transport personnel to India and the declaration of all essential craft as deliverable to the Commissioner of Disposals Board as only river communication exists at present between Basrah and Kut-el-Amara and the reconstruction of the Basrah  Baghdad railway line has not been decided upon by the Arab (?) Governmen t and it may be necessary to maintain (?) troops additional to present numbers north of Baghdad.At present we hold a surplus of both personnel and craft that have been used for operations connected with recent insurrection. Their retention is costly but their collection afresh will entail long delays if personnel are repatriated and craft sold overseas.Part 8. (10.) It would be advisable, if situation should approximate that outlined above, to meet aggression from the people by advance to some distance beyond Mosul, engaging hostile columns, (?) if possible, in detail. Likelihood of tribes rising in opposition to us would be diminished by such action.Mosul is 75 miles from present railhead at Shergat, and proposed advance, which would add considerably to length of road communications, would reduce amount of transport available and affect mobility of our forces. The extension of Baghdad Kifri line would entail long delay, and it would therefore be necessary to extend present Baghdad Shergat (? group omitted) to Mosul, or at least to Qaiyara, whence good .road commences.(?) Material would be required for this.
6 The possibility of an early reduction in the garrison of Mesopotamia is contingent on the attitude of the Mahommedan factions by which it is surrounded. All have their eyes at present fixed on Constantinople, and a reasonable peace with Turkey will in itself go far towards paving the way to a contented Mahommedan world, reducing proportionately our military responsibilities not only in Mesopotamia, but in all other Mahommedan countries.7. In this connection the General Staff have for many months repeatedly pointed out that the policy of antagonizing the Turks and thereby embittering the whole Mussulman world was involving us in unnecessary expense at the present time, and laying up for us untold liabilities in the future.APPENDIX C.From General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, to War Office.Despatched 1920, 2nd December, 1920; (No. X 788, cipher.)

APPENDIX D.GREEK TERRITORIAL CLAIMS IN TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared by the General Staff recording their 0152 ! protests against Greek territorial claims in Turkey. 5737W. S. C.The War Office, December, 1920.From the moment of the arrival of the Military Section of the British Peace Delegation in Paris early in 1919, the General Staff opposed the furtherance of Greek territorial claims at the expense of Turkey.At a preliminary meeting, which was held under the presidency of Lord ITardinge in the Hotel Astoria shortly after the opening of the Peace Conference, the General Staff, supported by the Admiralty, adopted the principle that the Maritza should form the western frontier of Turkey, and that Turkey should not be made to sacrifice territory in Asia otherwise than in Arabia, that is to say Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia and such area as it might be proposed to put in a mandate for Armenia.The same principle was adhered to in a paper entitled &quot; General Staff Desiderata regarding Territorial Adjustments&quot;, which was circulated on 19th February, 1919, in the Hotel Astoria, vide paragraphs (A) (ii.), (hi), (iv.) and (v.), which are printed as an Appendix to this memorandum.The General Staff then continued consistently to resist Greek encroachments upon Turkish territory. They were presented with a fait accompli by the occupation of Smyrna by Greece in May, 1919, which was executed in spite of their repeated protests.When confronted in July, 1919, with Mr. Balfour&apos;s decision to allow General Milne to assume responsibility for the Greek front in the Smyrna zone without reference to the General Staff, the Chief of the Imperial General 6taff protested vigorously in a personal correspondence with Mr. Philip Kerr. He stated that General Milne had been placed, in a most unfair position, that he had no force to enforce his orders, and that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff himself could not be a party to this arrangement, and, although he was compelled to carry out the orders of the Supreme Council, he did so under the most emphatic protest.Again the Army Council successfully opposed proposals that British troops should be employed in the Aid in Vilayet in support of the Greeks. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated on 13th September that unless a direct order came from the Cabinet there were no British troops and never would be any available to form part of an Allied force in Asia Minor.Arguments used by the General Staff were that Great Britain would have to pay the price of Greek gains and that the whole situation in the Near East would re-act unfavourably if Greek acquisitiveness was acquiesed in, more especially when the influence of M. Venizelos became removed. Their advice was, however, consistently ignored.On 1st April, 1920, prior to the Conf3rence at San Remo, where the Turkish Treaty was concluded, a General Staff Memorandum (CP. 1014) was circulated to the Cabinet in which the following words occur in paragraphs 9 and 10 : The General Staff, who are concerned only with British interests, have no desire to labour the Greek question, but desire to record their opinion that there will be no satisfactory settlement of the Turkish question until Greek ambitions are curbed. It follows that the Turks should retain their administrative position in, and access to Adrianople while Smyrna should remain under the Turkish flag
unless the Allied Powers are prepared to make greatly increased forces available and to undertake operations on a scale sufficient to secure the practical elimination of Turkey.To sum up, the General Staff are of the opinion that to persist in the present proposals for peace with Turkey with existing forces at the disposal of the Allies is to risk a great blow to British prestige without any corresponding return, and probably to cause massacres of Christians and Armenians on a scale unprecedented even in Turkey.As soon, however, as the policy had been finally ^settled at San Remo the General Staff naturally did what they could to co-operate with the Greeks, at the same time realizing full well the difficulties that would occur should M. Venizelos die or fall from power. This situation now exists and the General Staff view future developments, with the greatest anxiety.ANNEXURE,General Staff Desiderata regarding Territorial Adjustments.(A.) Former Turkish Empire in Asia.(ii.) Armenia. There is no objection to a mandate being given to another Power,, including America or France, but in the latter case it would be preferable strategically that Russian Armenia should remain independent and autonomous. The same Power should not hold the mandate over both Armenia and Syria. The non-Armenian elements, should be protected against Armenian persecution and exploitation, which would form a constant source of disturbance. A sine qua non of the recognition of any Armenian State should be the liquidation of the pernicious Dashnakzutiun society, part of whose activities is the instigation of outrages. Armenia need not be considered the only set-off against French claims in Syria.(iii.) Syria. The General Staff cannot concur in the establishment of any military Power on interior lines threatening the approaches to India. Syria should be an Arab State under British guidance and virtual control. The future recruiting power of-the Arabs should not be exposed to the influence of any Power other than ourselves. There is no objection to French enclaves at Beirut and Alexandretta, provided that: (a.) no military organizations are set up in them ;(b.) the coast-line between Tripoli and Tarsus (both inclusive) remain within a friendly Arab State as above.(iv.) Palestine. The formation of an independent Jewish State is strategically desirable, but it should be under British influence and must be reconciled with Arab national aspirations. The Jews should, however, be given sufficient territory to render possible the satisfactory economic development of their country. If Great Britain does not secure the mandate for Syria, the northern frontier of Palestine should be prolonged north-eastwards towards the Euphrates in order to cover as adequately as. possible potential railway routes from Palestine to the Euphrates and in order to cut off the Hedjaz Railway at a point north of Deraa.(v.) Mesopotamia. This should include Mosul and should be under as direct a form of British control as is politically practicable. If Syria is not under British influence as in (iii) above, the western boundary of Mesopotamia should follow the left bank of the Euphrates below Samsat and the northern frontier should include the Severek Diarbekr road. From Diarbekr it should follow the left bank of the Tigris to a point north of Midiat and thence follow the watershed to the Persian frontier at a point between Neri and Urumia. If Syria is under British influence the western frontier of Mesopotamia might follow the right bank of the western branch of the Balekh River so as to include Rakka. Both banks of the Euphrates should in either case be in the British sphere below Meskene. On the right bank the depth of the area under British control should be fixed locally so as to provide for protective measures,, without interfering unduly with tribal arrangements.
APPENDIX E. jTHE MILITARY SITUATION CREATED BY RECENT EVENTS IN RUSSIAjCAUCASIA, TURKEY AND GREECE.I. Present Situation in European Russia and Caucasia. l. With the annihilation of General WrangeFs Army in the crimea the Soviet troops have disposed of their roost important adversary in the field, and excluding certain insurgent bands in the Cis-Caucasia, there now only remain General BalahovitclVs forces (11,000) and General Petlura&apos;s Ukrainian levies (30,000), which are now virtually eliminated, on the Russian Western front. There seems no reason to suppose that either of these commanders will be more successful than their predecessors General Miller, General Yudenitch, Admiral Kolchak, General Denikin and General Wrangel,Although the immediate object of the Soviet Government must be to remedy the terrible economic condition, of their country, there are few signs yet that they are prepared to sacrifice their aim of world wide revolution&apos;, which they are seeking to attain by propaganda aided by military pressure where circumstances are favourable.2. On the Russian Western front the recognition by Russia of the independence of Finland, Esthonia and Latvia has left her with a seaboard of but 80 miles in the Gulf of Finland which, moreover, is closed by ice for a great part of the year. Such a situation must be intolerable to a great nation, and although Bussia is too much occupied at present to attack the new States, there can be no doubt that she must eventually burst out to an ice free seaboard on the Baltic, absorbing in so doing the States of Latvia, Estjionia and Lithuania either with or without their concurrence, or the concurrence of anybody else.3. Poland though she has successfully resisted the Bolshevik attack and has imposed a peace on Russia which gives her more territory than the Allies were prepared to grant her, makes no attempt to conceal the fact that she regards the peace as only a truce. Though each State suspects the other and appears to be firmly convinced that the conflict will he renewed, it is more probable that Russia will be the aggressor. There is a ready-made casus belli at any time in the Ukrainian and White Russian movements which notwithstanding official denials Poland has hitherto supported. Coupled with these dangers is the fact that Poland blocks trade between Germany and Russia, which is probably an essential element in the economic reconstruction of Germany.It is the accepted policy of Great Britain and her Allies to maintain the independence of Poland as defined by the Treaty of Versailles, and should Russia attack Poland we must be prepared to receive a new demand for assistance. It must always be remembered that a land-locked Poland with no independent access to the sea is militarily unsupportable and helpless commercially.Ill the Caucasus the Bolshevists, though still hampered ,by risings of the Cossack peoples in their rear and by revolts in Daghestan, have installed a Soviet Government in Azerbaijan which is independent only in name. The Azerbaijan Government has allowed the Bolshevik troops freedom of movement through their country, an opportunity which the Government of Russia has turned to account by combining with the forces of the Turkish leader Kiazim Kara Bekir to enforce the submission of Armenia. The Turkish forces have occupied Kars and Alexandropol, while the Bolshevik troops are at Shusha and Nakhitchevan, so that the territory of Armenia will probably shrink to the small triangle between the south-west shores of Lake Gorcha, a point a few miles south of Erivan Alexandropol, and the Russians and their Turkish allies can make use of the Julfa - Alexandropol Kars Sarikamish railway at discretion.Georgia alone remains, and there can be no doubt but that she will fall into the Russian system on the same terms as the Azerbaijan Republic in default of assistance from the Entente Powers or open support from a reconstructed Turkey.   When this is(8792)B
accomplished, the Tiflis Baku railway and its extension to Alexandropol will be at Russia&apos;s disposal, and she will be free to move troops to the old Turkish frontier as in 1914.5. The situation in Persia and Trans-Caspia has been dealt with inmany papers and it if unnecesasry to do more than repeat that we must anticipate the eventual reinforcement of the Russian forces on the southern shores of the Caspian and a possible advance into Persia, from Enzeli, Tabriz and Astarabad, which it is probable the British force in North-West Persia has momentarily prevented.II. Present Situation in Turkey in Asia.6. The Turkish Government has delayed ratification of the Peace Treaty, and in the meantime three important events have occurred, namely, the defeat of Armenia, the elimination of Wrangel, and the political overthrow of Venizelos. The Turks must now be elated, and are represented by a body of able and persistent adventurers who will not fail to turn to full account any opportunity which is offered. It may be instructive to remember in this connection Enver&apos;s return march to Adrianople in 1913. This he was able to make owing to the outbreak of hostilities between the erstwhile allies Greece and Bulgaria.7. The two militant parties in Turkey which are working for the revision of the Turkish Treaty&apos; are (a.) The Committee of Union and Progress, headed by Enver and Talaat. (6.) Nationalists, headed by Mustafa Kemal.The former have, since they saw that there was no hope of influencing the terms of peace, for the time thrown in their lot definitely with the Bolsheviks, while the evidence in our possession appears to warrant the conclusion that the Nationalists, though anxious to secure Russian arms and ammunition, to intrigue, to obtain assistance from Italy, and to use Russian forces to recover Armenia, are not unanimously in favour of allowing the Bolsheviks to penetrate into Anatolia.8. In dealing with the Turks it will be well to remember that Mustafa Kemal and Enver are rivals, that Enver has already been discredited by the Entente, and that his influence is probably greater in Russia than in Turkey itself. Any arrangement that is made with Turkey will have to be carried through with a representative Government, and this can only be obtained by amalgamating &quot; Young Turks&quot; and &quot; Old Turks.&quot; A new head will be necessary, and it seems probable that this will best be provided by Mustafa Kemal himself, whose recognition should have the effect of driving Enver and Jemal into obscurity or finally into the arms of Russia to carry on their intrigues and personal ambitions in Central Asia, thus eliminating their influence on the Turkish problem proper.III. Existing Military Resources oe  A. Russia.B.-Turkey and Trans-Caucasia. &apos; A. Russia.9. The relative military resources of Russia and her neigh-hours are compared in the following table. Relative strengths are expressed for convenience by numbers representing rifle and sabre fighting strengths as the size of the formations vary, and, therefore, a comparison by formations is apt to be misleading. It should be noted that whereas the fighting strength figure of the Soviet Red Army is 396,000, the feeding strength of military personnel in the Army is about 1,000,000 :

From the above table it appears that so long as the Red Army remains loyal the Russians, profiting from natural jealousies and the war weariness of her neighbours, have sufficient military resources to attack at least any one of their hostile neighbours between the Baltic and the Caspian Sea with a reasonable prospect of success.11. As regards Trans-Caucasia, there are great natural obstacles to be overcome in-military operations, and these are even more important military factors than the actual number of troops which might be available. Generally speaking, it is doubtful whether the Soviet Government could enforce its will on Afghanistan by military operations in the face of real national resistance on the part of the Afghans. It should, however, be quite practicable for it to employ sufficient forces to occupy and control - -he whole of Northern Persia, in view of the fact that the Persian Government has practically no-armed force at its disposal.12. It would appear that the Soviet Government can only maintain itself in power by force of its army. The Red Army, by reason of its nature, must be kept in full employment, otherwise it will re-act on the Government. Hence we may expect to see&apos; that army in perpetual activity until the ambitions of Russia are satiated. In this connection a most important point to be considered with reference to the Russian Army is the want of clothing and boots. This disability during the coming winter, if maintained, will do more to render the forces innocuous in the coming spring than any shortage of arms and ammunition. Every endeavour should consequently be made to prevent stocks purchased by Russia from reaching their destination.B. Turkey and Trans-Caucasia.13. The Nationalist Army in Turkey may be divided into two portions :(1.) The Eastern Army under Kiazim Kara Bekir. (2.) The Western Army under Mustafa Kemal.Mustafa Kemal is nominally Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Armies, but he is believed to have little power over Kiazim Kara Bekir, who appears to represent the faction which is in closest alliance with the Russian Bolsheviks. Kiazim Kara Bekirs Army is tied up in Armenia and presumably could not yet be withdrawn without risk of a fresh rising on the part of the Armenians.14. In the Western Army under Mustafa Kemal there are availableto meet the Greeks or to threaten Lieut.-General Haringtons command on the Ismid(8792) . c
front three Turkish Array Corps or about 28,000 combatants, which might be reinforced from the corps in the Sivas-Samsim and the corps in the Diarbekir area. The state of the communications and the necessity for keeping troops in these latter areas limit the numbers available for reinforcements, and it is believed that the maximum force whioh could be employed by the Nationalists in the west can for the present be put at 30,000 regulars and 10,000 irregulars15. Turkey also has forces operating against the French in Cilicia and concentrating against the British in the neighbourhood of Jezireh on the Tigris. The function of these forces is probably rather to keep alive the Arab hostility to France and Great Britain for the present, than to undertake any direct operations on their own account, but they will inevitably seize any opportunity which may be offered to profit by the situation.IV. Present Situation of the Allies at Constantinople and in turkey in Asia,16, The French and British troops in the neighbourhood of Constanti-nople amount at present to 1.5 battalions, plus one cavalry regiment, and will shortly be decreased by the departure of three battalions, so that the Entente is dependent on the Greek Army in Asia Miuor, which recently amounted to eight divisions or 110,000 rifles and sabres and is holding a line from the Black Sea, north of Ismid, to the southern end of the Smyrna enclave. These formations were in course of reduction . before the Greek election ending in the overthrow of M. Venizelos, a reduction, which although on a scale that would not have endangered the position of the Entente at Constantinople, was inevitable in view of the financial situation of Greece. It is impossible to say what effect the elections may have on the Greek Army or Greek policy, but it is certain that we must reckon with the probability that any formed Government may find itself unable to maintain the Army in anything approaching its present strength or indeed that the Army may disrupt itself automatically from reactionary causes due to aftermath of war.Y. Future Contingencies.17. As regards the Baltic States it has been shown that Russia must eventually absorb these completely or reduce them to the position of provinces of Russia. No vital interests of the British Empire appear to be threatened by such action and it does not appear to be an issue which the Empire should pledge a single company of soldiers to influence.18. As tor Poland., in contrast to the situation in the Baltic States, the British Empire cannot stand aside without making an effort to maintain, its independence which is a vital condition of the Treaty of Versailles. It appears certain that the Soviet Republic will sooner or later attack Poland, and the Allies will be called upon for assistance. The present resources of the British Army are not sufficient to add its quota to Allied armed assistance even if the people of Great Britain would tolerate it. Further, in the opinion of the General Staff the procedure should be confined to influencing the situation by endeavouring to remove the causes which are most likely to induce Russia to attack. The steps recommended to this end are the following :-(a.) Assist Poland to make herself strong by giving her permission to buy such stores and material in Allied countries, or even Germany, as she can pay for(b.) Use every means to prevent Poland from adopting an aggressive and consequently foolish policy.(c.) Discourage Polish assistance to the White Russian and Ukrainian movements.Id.) Prevent or impede the re-equipment of the Bolshevik armies.19. In the Caucasus the Russian Bolshevik Government, if it decided to pursue such a scheme and to diminish its commitments in other directions, is in a position (vide Part 2) to re-establish its previous frontier. Through communication by sea with Trebizond could be prevented by the Entente navies, and land communica-tions west of the Nakhichevan-Kars railway are poor in the winter, aggravated by climatic conditions, there appears to be no reason to think that the Bolsheviks could not then establish themselves even at Erzeroum or on a line west of Erzingan through -the Giaour Dagh to the Black Sea, which they reached in 1917, unless the Turks can he persuaded to oppose them with united forces.
It will be remembered that before the Russian debacle in 1917 the Russians had established and maintained an army of about 250,000 men on this front and though they might not at present spare this number, there is no reason why, given time, the Soviet Government should not reproduce the same result as was accomplished in the Czarist regime. Once established on the above line the Bolsheviks would be in a position to choose their own line of advance either westward in support of the Turkish Unionist and Nationalist forces or southwards into Mesopotamia and Persia, by the routes leading from Erzeroum to Van and Mosul.20. As regards Mesopotamia and Persia, it is outside the scope ofthis paper to discuss in detail this situation, but there is ample evidence to show that the Bolsheviks are pursuing relentlessly their aim of striking at British power in both these countries. This they will continue to do by turning to account the instrument for propaganda placed in their hands by the terms of the present Turkish Treaty. Thus they may increase the likelihood of a recrudescence of the Mesepotamian troubles of this summer, which would force us to despatch large reinforcements if our position is to be maintained, and will vitally affect our position in Persia whether we decide to retain our troops in the country or not.VI.  Conclusion.21. An endeavour has been made to show that in Europe the situation is not such as will necessarily involve British military commitments, but the disappearance of Wrangel, the capitulation of Armenia, the imminent threat to Georgia and the downfall of Venizelos confront us with a situation in the Middle East with which it may be beyond our power to cope without a change of policy.22. In the opinion of the General Staff recent events have shown clearly that whatever may be the outcome of the present crisis in Greece, it is unsafe to rely upon the Greek Army to cover the Allied position in Turkey, in support of which His Majesty&apos;s Government must be prepared either to (a.) Send reinforcements to Constantinople. lb.) Withdraw the existing British troops, or (c.) Re-adjust the Allied policy.The first alternative, owing to the present state of the British military resources, is out of the question as a permanent measure. As regards the second, however * desirable from a military point of view, a question of high policy is involved, and in any case a temporary reinforcement to effect withdrawal would probably be necessary. The General Staff, however, believe that a drastic revision of the territorial terms of the Turkish Treaty in respect of Smyrna, the province of Kars, and possibly of Thrace, would induce the Turkish Nationalists to break with the Russian Soviet Government. In short, the change in the Government of Greece, though it alters the situation of the British and Allied troops temporarily for the worse at Constantinople, gives the opportunity to make gracious concessions to the Turks, and so wean them from their alliance with the Russian Bolsheviks, by this means recreating Turkey as a buffer State between the Entente Powers and Russia, and removing some of the principal underlying causes of unrest throughout the British dominions in Egypt, Mesopotamia and India.
