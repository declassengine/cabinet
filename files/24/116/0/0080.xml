Circulated by the Secretary&apos; of State for India,SECRET./--U   CP.   22 3 0Telegram, from High Commissioner, Baghdad, dated Sth December .1.020.i:)rivate.   Your private telegram, of 2nd December.Parti. 1. Accepting assumptions and provisoes stated in your telegram, and on understanding that necessary shipping facilities will he forthcoming, I anticipate that by 31st March 1921 it should be possible to reduce garrison to strength given in War &apos; Office telegram 86703 D.M.O., dated 1st November 1920, addressed to General Headquarters : Infantry Divisions two, Cavalry Brigade one, and line of communication battalions exclusive of troops in North-West Persia. Further reduction of this force will depend on successful creation of a new Mesopotamian Army, and I hope that gradual recruitment of this army will be as follows: By (? 7t.ii September) 1921, 1,000; by April 1922, 6,500; by October 1922, 10,000; by April .1923, 15,000; provided that always financial provision is forthcoming. These figures are exclusive of existing levies, whose numbers are being raised gradually to sanctioned strength, 5,000. The progressive creation of these forces should enable us to dispense with one brigade in October 1921, and thereafter to make progressive reductions until by April 1923 there would be in the country only one British division. It is conceivable that if things progress very well, that we may find ourselves able to do with less, but 1 do not, think it would be safe at present to contemplate reduction below (? a) division. Mesopotamia (? must) always be &quot; Iraq (&apos;? Irredenta)&quot; to Turk (two corrupt groups), and until Turkish are effectively (V expelled) a national Government, unsupported by foreign troops, would be unlikely to survive.Para. 2.-These figures are designed to give effect to a policy of concentration pursued to a point at which further concentration would invite attack. Thus during coming hot weather there will be no British troops between Nasiriyah and Hillah troops being concentrated at Basrah, Baghdad, Mosul and Kirkuk (? with) garrisons at Amara, Kut and Hillah, and Dhiwhatan and Ramadi Hit only. I hope (? to maintain) order between Nasiriyah and Hillah by a force of Arab local levies, base Samawah, and for other vacant areas to trust to mobile columns maintained at points of concentration. It will not be practicable to reduce still further or to leave areas altogether beyond reach of troops, because, in connection with present Turkish and other menaces, areas abandoned would probably be occupied by actively hostile element.Para. 3. I have net available the figures of cost which would enable me accurately to estimate precise value of these reductions to His Majesty&apos;s Government in pounds sterling. In Mesopotamia!! budget for current (? financial) year, a provision of between forty and fifty lakhs has been made on account of levies. It is hoped to provide 120 lakhs on local military forces including levies in 1921-22, and .150 lakhs in succeeding year.As far as can be estimated at present, these allotments should cover the cost of local forces raised at rate of progression described in para. 1 in addition to 5,000 levies. If recruits are forthcoming at a higher rate than that indicated above, it would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider advisability of advancing funds to enable Mesopotamian Army to be brought to its maximum strength in a shorter time thau that at present contemplated. In this connection, it is obvious that net comparative cost of local forces would be considerably below that of equivalent British troops, as not only wages will be much less, but overseas transport and collateral services will be saved. Unfortunately until the (? present) Government is replaced by a permanent constitution, it may be difficult to fix exact terms of service for National Army, and consequently to calculate man power represented by 150 lakhs.Another difficulty is fact that oven-head charges do not decrease proportionately with reduction in strength. But as against this the scheme outlined above contemplates, according to existing military view, reduction first in outlying districts, so that most expensive units to maintain could be withdrawn first. If present average cost of force be accepted as a basis then, calculates of progress of reduction of expenditure could probably be estimated by War Office.Para. I.  I wish, however, to emphasise following point.   The provision ot funds, which, as explained above, it is hoped to make during ensuing financial vears, 2D01     100   12.20
will curtail desirable expenditure on Civil Departments and on development of the country. Every item brought about will have to be (? greatly) scrutinised. But while it will be within the power of National Government to check any extravagance in civil expenditure, in the case of military expenditure the situation will be entirely different, as National Government will not possess- the same right to scrutinise or criticise it, but they will at any rate be entitled to feel assured that military expenditure is also administered with, views of economy. I assume that union of civil and military control which you foreshadow in your telegram will, connote the appointment of a competent Financial Adviser whose duty it will be to advise me on military expenditure. It&apos; that development is likely to take time, I suggest that a committee should be appointed by General Officer Comrnauder-in-Chief in consultation with me, to which I would depute a representative. In making this suggestion of (sic) I particularly does (sic) not wish it be (? thought) that I am prejudicing the question of military expenditure in Mesopotamia, but I have noticed since my arrival in connection with occasional allusions in newspapers or telegrams to heavy burdens at present laid upon British taxpayer (two corrupt groups) that their (? there) exists in minds of leaders of opinion here both in Council and outside at high cost of present military regime as judged by light of their own standard, and it would be easier to secure co-operation of National Government in making largest possible contribution of military expenditure if I were at all events in a position to assure them that aggregate account was not unduly swollen by avoidable expenditure.
