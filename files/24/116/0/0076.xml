Memerandurn by tho Cha no oliorjof jtho ftrohequer.With ref or once tr my previous cup memoranda (Cr. 2139 and CP, 2157) regarding .tho financial position of Austria, I circulate herewith for the information of the Cabinet the following extract from- a Re -ort addressed to the General Secretariat of the Reparation commissioners si on by Mrf B.A1. Bey den, the American Unofficial Delegate,I have made notes in the margin of the total amount of the&apos; British contributions,(Into.) A.C.Treasury, S.w.10th December. 19EC.7 No trociso figures are avail-able ^ but it is estimated that the amounts raised by Private Char-&apos;!ties in this goun.try and spent on Austrian relief exceeded j.700,000.x U.K. credits  10,295,000 (de-tails sriyen in (CP,2139) .&quot;The Unofficial Delegation has cabled the substance of both reports to its Government,   The official attitude of the United States is well known.   Briefly, it has since the Armistice contributed enormous sums to the general European situation.   Its purely charitable contributions from private sources to the di ;ect relief of Austria may b conservatively estimated at more thai. $110,000,000. r Its frovernmental credits to Austria amount to more than $24,000,000/    Its present outstanding loans to other Governments&quot; for Austrian relief amount to $32,000,000.   Under theso circumstances the United States Crovornment, recognising first its inability to continue outlays of this character and amount, and second
second that rehabilitation of the States concerned inevitably depends upon their own courage, good sense and efficiency and their own resources, has stated definitely its policy not to make further governmental loans.   &apos;l&apos;his formal doolaration of policy and possibly the necessity of further legislation if anything&quot; is to be done - will obviously aifect its present decision upon the proposals of&quot; the Austrian. Section with respect to Austrian relief.But apart from this question and without prejudice to any position whioh its Government may take, the delegation expresses the opinion that tho United States however strongly it may favour the project itselfs is likely to prefer not to participate actively in a conference which should have for its main purpose the recognition and development of the principle of self-help.&quot; -
