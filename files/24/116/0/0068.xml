rty of &apos; /VCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.Telegram from, High Commissioner, Mesopotamia, dated 5th December 1920.Tour telegram of the 12th November last, 13787. I gather from Reuter telegram reports position of Greece in Smyrna is likely to come under review very shortly. His Majesty&apos;s Government are doubtless aware that concessions to Moslem sentiment as regards this area may be expected not only to prove inducement even more satisfactory to success than the proposed recognition of Turkish suzerainty over Azerbaijan, but also to have a very favourable effect on politically minded here.Our treatment of Turkey vis-a-vis Greece inspires distrust among the Moderates, who are unable to reconcile what they consider to be a policy of European exploitation there with our profession of sympathy with the principle of Nationalism here. I should, therefore, be glad to have early intimation any revision which may be(? made).2889-1     100  12.20
