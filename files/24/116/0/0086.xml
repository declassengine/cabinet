[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Jgf)Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.......THE RUSSIAN TRADE AGREEMENT.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN the discussions about the above agreement, I have throughout confined myself to urging that the political assurances given by the Soviet Government and described by us in our note of the 20th June as &quot; the fundamental condition of any trading agreement&quot; should neither be evaded nor whittled away, nor should evaporate in misty generalities, leading to indefinite procrastination and barren disputes: I was afraid that unless we were very much on the alert the Russians might get their Trade Agreement, while we should lose what is, in my view, our sole quid pro quo, viz., the cessation of Soviet hostilities and propaganda, both at home and in the East. From the abundant evidence at our disposal, it looks as though my fears were in danger of being realised even more quickly than I had imagined.At the Cabinet of the 2(ith November I pointed out from the testimony of their own utterances that the Soviet leaders did not mean their political assurances, in so far as they were referred to or repeated in the Trade Agreement, to have any immediate or binding application. . They were to be made the subject of a future political conference, attended by political delegates from Russia and Great Britain, and this conference was to develop into the Peace Conference, wThich is their real aim, and to carry with it the recognition of the Soviet Government by Great Britain.When I asked the Cabinet whether, assuming this to be the Soviet policy, it was one which we were prepared to accept, I was assured that nothing of the kind was in contemplation; that references to the areas to which the Soviet assurances of desistance from propaganda or hostilities were intended more particularly to apply would be inserted in the preamble, and that the meaning which His Majesty&apos;s Government attached to them would further be elucidated in a letter to be handed to M. Krassin at the same time as the agreement was signed.We now know that the exact procedure which I ventured to anticipate has been followed. In repeated telegrams between Chicherin and Krassin the former has laid down, and the latter has acted upon, the contention that our preamble, containing the afore-named references, must be rejected; that all references to particular spheres of political activity must be expunged ; that the commercial clauses &quot; are immediately to come into action, while the political preliminaries are merely the groundwork in principle for ensuing political negotiations.,&quot; (Chicherin to Krassin, the 3rd December, 1920.)The most outspoken of these revelations is probably that contained in another message of the 5th December from Chicherin to Krassin : &quot; We refuse to add even a single letter to the July agreement. Without a political conference we cannot limit our activity in the East, since only at such a conference will the concrete obligations that bind us be compensated by concrete obligations binding England.   Without this we refuse to bind ourselves.&quot;In other words, the political assurances which the Soviet Government accepted as long ago as July are to be worth nothing until they have been explored and certified by a political conference at a later date; at this conference each item of the indictment is to be disputed and met by counter-charges, and nothing is to be conceded unless it is balanced by some corresponding assurance on the part of Great Britain. Such a conference may well last for months, and in the interval (while the Russians are enjoying the, to them, immeasurable advantages of British trade) the propaganda and the hostilities will pursue their career unchecked.That this is the aim of the Soviets is further demonstrated by their alarm at the provisions in the preamble that in case of conspicuous violation of the terms of the378   [5115]l- * - &apos;T&quot;:--,
agreement by either party, it may forthwith be denounced by the other, and by the pressure which they are applying to get the minimum period of notice extended to six months.1 once again plead with my colleagues not to allow ourselves to be cheated by these tactics. There are two alternatives before us. One is to adhere to the preamble which was approved on the 26th November (although some of us would have greatly preferred that it should be made stronger and more specific). The other is to yield to the Soviet plea that the political assurances can only be defined at a subsequent political conference summoned ad hoc in other words, they will remain in abeyance until we succeed in coming to an agreement with the Bolsheviks as to their exact meaning and application,If we adopt the latter policy, it seems to me that we shall have abandoned the greater part of what we have been fighting for, and that we shall be left with only the remotest chance of mitigating or stopping Bolshevik hostilities and propaganda at all.On the former occasion I pleaded that the fulfilment of the political conditions should be anterior to the conclusion of the Trade Agreement^ Ihe Cabinet decided that it should be simultaneous. It is now proposed that it should be indefinitely subsequent. I hope that this stratagem may be defeated, and that our preamble will be retained.C. of K.December 13, 1920.
