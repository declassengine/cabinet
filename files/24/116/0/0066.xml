AMSECBET. 1 oi.............i .JLcp. 2266.THE CABINET.provision of shipping for movement of prisoners in ireland.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Memorandum in regard to the provision of shipping for the movement     120 of prisoners in connection with the Irish emergency.   The matter is one of considerable Gen. No. urgency. ;v&apos; 8947W. S. C.The War Office, 9th December, 1920.1. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, the Forces in Ireland, requests that two vessels, each capable of conveyance of at least 100 prisoners and escort at a time from Southern and Western Irish ports to Belfast for Ballykinlar, may be put at his disposal.He also requests that these two vessels may be based on Queenstown, but that in the first instance one may be sent to Dublin to evacuate 60 convicts from Dublin to Portland, at the request of the Civil Government.He presses for a reply, as in his opinion the matter is urgent.2. The Admiralty inform the War Office that, in their opinion, His Majestys ships are most unsuitable for the conveyance of large detachments of prisoners and escort, and that they are therefore averse from the employment of His Majesty&apos;s ships on this service except as a last resort.The Admiralty suggest that every effort should be made to obtain mercantile transport, and see no reason to think that insuperable trouble will be experienced with the mercantile personnel.3. The Ministry of Shipping inform the War Office that they are satisfied that a certain class of naval sloop can be made suitable for this service ; that though mercantile vessels are obtainable it is not, in their opinion, desirable to charter them while suitable Admiralty-owned sloops are available ; and that the use of sloops is more economical than chartering vessels.They are further strongly of opinion that any attempt to man with mercantile ratings vessels, either naval sloops or mercantile vessels, for the conveyance of Irish prisoners, will result in the refusal of the crews to sail the vessels, and possibly in the calling out of the seamen and firemen, or the whole of the mercantile marine. They therefore decline to provide the vessels required without Cabinet authority.4. The Cabinet are asked to decide as to the method of conveyance of the prisoners, and if mercantile boats are to be used whether naval crews should be provided.(1320/500)   100  12/20  ]J&amp;S,Ltd.  6787wo
