THIS DOOTENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITMNIC MAJESTY&apos;S OOVERIMSNT)&apos;.CONFIDENTIAL *CABINET,LEAOp;, OF   NATIONS.THE AM S31 ON^OF,       MEMBERS TO TO LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Report of committee on the a tods tion of Auatriat(Circulated for Information)*The Fifth ewmmittee. has the honour to submit to the Assembly its- report on the application of the Republic of AUSTRIA for admission to the league of Nations.The committee expresses itself in favour of this admission. December 6th, 192o* . Ohairmane1* Is the application for admission to the League   of Nations in order?1.   The application of Austria for admission to the league was regularly made except that it was not reaeived &quot;by the Secretariat until the ilth November.   By the rules provisionally adopted &quot;by the Assembly,, a month;s notioe must be given of any motion to be made unless the Assenbly otherwise decides.   That rule was j of bourse, not in&apos; fo me at the time of Austria&apos;9 application, and therefore the committee are of opinion that the application must be held to&apos;be regular and in order.2. Is- the Government recognised de jure *r de faoto, and by whioh&apos;states?3. Boss the country possess a stable Government and settled frontiers?   &quot;$hat are its size and its population?4. Is the country, fully self-governing?5. 7,hat ha3 been the conduct of the country including both acts and assurances with regard to :-A* Its international obligations^B. The prescriptions of the League as to armaments,2, 3, 4 and 5.   We&quot; also find that all these questions must be answered in the affirmative.   The Government of Austria has been generally recognised ds jure,,   she has a stable Government and fixed frontiers.   ?he has a considerable area and over 6 million inhabitants *   She is fully self-governing. -As to her intention&quot;to carry out her international obliga-tions, the Austrian representatives deolared that she had shown by her acts and assurances that she. had a sincere intention to do 80y and this view was strongly supported by the serbo-Croato-slovene representative.   Nor was it disputed by any of her other- neighbours, -
340We, therefore, find that she has&apos; shown a sincere intentionto sarry out her international obligations.As for her military force, it has been reduced even &quot;below that which was allowed to her under the Treaty, and we have no doubt that she will carry out all the military prescriptions of the iea,^ue.I, MOTTA, the Swiss ropresentative, ur^ed that, &quot;if Austria were allowed to enter the League, it should be understood that the vorarlberg should have the right freely to dispose of itself if the new Austrian state should in the future undergo any fundamental chancellor ;e**do not think that the consideration of this contention comes within our reference^ nevertheless, out of deference to1C llotta, we listened to his Observations cn the subject, and venture to state, $aifce unofficially, the conclusions at which we arrived in the matter.re cannot recommend the adoption of the proposal put f*r-ward by M* Motta in the resolution itself.   we are, indeed, of opinion that the entry at Austria into the league will in no way prejudge or affect the question so raised.   Ve cannot help adding that the suggestion that the admission to the League should have any euoh effect, could only arise from a misconstrue-ti on of Article ID.   X&apos;&apos;t cannot be too emphatically stated that Article 10 does not guarantee the territorial integrity of any Member of the League *   AH it does i s to condemn external aggression on the territorial integrity and political indepen-dence of any Member of the Lea-axe, and call upon the Council to consider what oan be done to resist such aggression.K. Motta concurred in this opinion which he considered to be correct.Whitehall Gartxns, 14th December, 1920*
