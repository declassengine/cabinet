aThis document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government. 27SECRET.THE CABINET.MESOPOTAMIAN MANDATE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a Memorandum on the Mandate for Mesopotamia in which exception is    0152 taken by the War Office to amendments to Article 5, which were approved by a    5640 Conference of Ministers on 18th October in the absence of any representative of the War Office, and were taken note of at Cabinet 59 (20).    I should be glad if my colleagues would give the question further consideration.w. s. c.The War Office,30th November. 1920.Prior to amendment by the Conference of Ministers of 18th October, Article 5 of the Draft Mandate for Mesopotamia read as follows : &quot; The Mandatory may maintain troops in the territories under its Mandate (for the defence of these territories) until the entry into force of the Organic Law and the re-establishment of public security ; it may organize and employ local forces necessary for the maintenance of order [and for the defence of these territories]. [Such forces may only be recruited from the inhabitants of the territories under the Mandate.]&quot; The said local forces shall subsequently be responsible to the local authorities, subject always to the control to be exercised over these forces by the Mandatory power, whose duty it will be to prevent them being employed for other than the above-mentioned purposes.&quot; [Note. The words in brackets in the above article are to be inserted only if the French consent to insert similar provisions in the corresponding Article of the Draft Mandate for Syria,,]&quot; *A conference of Ministers on 18th October agreed to the Draft Mandate subject to following qualifications, amongst others, viz. : &quot; The insertion of a provision enabling the Mandatory to employ local forces otherwise than for the maintenance of order and the defence of the Mandated territories, with the consent of the local government.&quot;The Foreign Office accordingly conveyed to Lord Derby the sense of this decision in their telegrams Nos. 1112 and 1113 of 18th October, stating in the latter that the new text of the second paragraph of Article 5 of the Mesopotamian Mandate was to be as follows: &quot; The said local forces shall thereafter be responsible to the local authorities, subject always to the control to be exercised over these forces by the Mandatory Power, who shall not employ them for other than the above-mentioned purposes except with the consent of the Mesopotamian Government.&quot;Lord Derby was also informed that otherwise Article 5 would be submitted to the French as it stands, including the portions in brackets, provided the French adopt the same wording for the Syrian Mandate.The Army Council consider it necessary to point out that they were not consulted regarding these amendments, and on 27th October they recorded in an official letter to the Foreign Office their protest against the contents of the telegrams to Lord Derby embodying these amendments.(B20/d63)   100   11/20  H&amp;8, Ltd   8716wo
!As it appears that, in case of its being desired to employ the local forces outside Mesopotamia, the consent of the local Government/ would be necessary, it would, in the opinion of the War Office, be advisable to obtain some assurance from the future Government of Mesopotamia that a request of this nature will not be refused, otherwise the object of the proviso in question may be defeated.The French will undoubtedly require reciprocal freedom for the employment of troops raised in their Mandatory area, and judging from past ^experience tney will he more ready to make use of this freedom than will His Majesty&apos;s Government. Thus a field may be provided for awkward incidents in the future.At the present moment a French column is on the move, to Deir-ez-Zor, and the French administration in Syria is showing indications of interference on the North-Eastern frontier of Palestine in the Ajlun district.It is not clear whether these points were brought to the notice of the Conference of 18th October or the Cabinet (59 (20)) held on 3rd November, but it is considered that they are of such material importance as to warrant further Cabinet consideration.
