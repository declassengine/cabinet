Hl* BriGovernment.From Secretary of State to Viceroy,.ForeigwD&amp;partment,.8th December 1920.Clear the line.3880. Your telegram dated the 25th November, 4360 S. Afghanistan. His Majesty&apos;s Government after giving most careful consideration to your presentation of case still feel serious misgivings in regard to your proposals.They adhere to view, which they understand Your Excellency to share, that no treaty of friendship can be concluded with Afghanistan if it ultimately appears that Afghans have committed themselves definitely to treaty with Bolsheviks including obviously anti-British provisions such as establishment of Consulates in Eastern Afghanistan. They fear that despatch of mission to Kabul in existing circumstances may expose us to risk of misrepresentation and even humiliation at hand of Afghans, and that even if Afghan goodwill be assumed its presence will afford opportunity to Turks and Bolsheviks of stirring up trouble with a view to embroiling Afghans with us. In any case Amir has deliberately avoided replying to our definite requests, and, once our mission is at Kabul, there is risk that our hands will constantly be forced by consideration that almost any concession is preferable to failure to secure agreement at all; His Majesty&apos;s Government would, in all the circumstances, have preferred to insist upon definite answer to our questions from Amir before proceeding further, and they think that this procedure holds out best hope of permanent settlement. But they do not feel justified in overriding deliberate judgment of Government of India on a matter lying so peculiarly within its province, and accordingly if after full considera-tion you adhere to your recommendations, you are authorised to accept Amir&apos;s invitation forthwith without further reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government. . Question of personal risk to members of mission under present condition at Kabul has no doubt suggested itself to you. I presume that you will take any precautions that may be possible.
