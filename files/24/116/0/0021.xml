[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]65-printed for the Cabinet,  December 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.EGYPTIAN COTTON CONTROL SCHEME.&amp;(sc)----AT their meeting on the 11th June last the disposal of the surplus Cotton Control funds was again considered by the Cabinet, r On that occasion the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade offered to surrender to Egypt three-quarters of the profit, which is now estimated at   E. 3,600,000, but it was decided to postpone a decision until matters in Egypb had settled down and a general agreement had been concluded.The Secretary of State for the Colonies considered that in this event it might be possible for His Majestys Government to obtain a full half-share; on the other hand, if no agreement could be negotiated, it might be necessary to surrender the whole amount to the Egyptian Government.From the various memoranda on this subject circulated from time to time to the Cabinet, it is clear that the disposal of the surplus can only be effected &quot; by agreement&quot; between the two Governments, and as the money is in Egypt the Government of that country are in a position of vantage.A telegram has recently been received from Lord Allenby, in which he reports that the Egyptian Government are pressing Sir W. Hayter, the Chairman of the Cotton Control Board, to release the surplus which is required to meet the budgetary needs of the Egyptian Treasury. This development renders an immediate decision necessary, as it would be most improper for the Foreign Office to instruct Sir W. Hayter, a servant of the Egyptian Government, to refuse to comply with the reasonable demands of the Egyptian Council of Ministers. It wo aid likewise be undesirable to urge him only to release a portion of the funds, as the fact that some were being withheld would inevitably leak out and lay Sir Wm. Hayter and His Majesty&apos;s Government open to a charge of dishonesty. In these circumstances it seems essential to deal quite frankly with the Egyptian Government.Lord Allenby has repeatedly urged the view that the entire surplus should go to Egypt, and, primarily on grounds of expediency, the Foreign Office have supported his contention. As, however, the conclusion of a general settlement with the Egyptian Government cannot possibly be reached for a considerable time to come, some compromise reasonably satisfactory to both parties would appear to be the best way out of the immediate difficulty.Before suggesting the terms of such a compromise it is desirable to draw the attention of the Cabinet to another matter to which Lord, Allenby rightly attaches the greatest importance, and which is likely to produce a profound political effect amongst the masses of the Egyptian population. Towards the end of July Lord Allenby informed the Foreign Office of the utterly inadequate nature of the indemnities which were being paid to members of the Egyptian Labour Corps seriously injured on active service with the British Expeditionary Force and to the families of those who lost their lives. Without going into great detail, it may be said that at present widows or orphan children receive an indemnity equivalent to the salary of the wage earner for one year, whilst men who have lost two limbs or both eyes receive a like amount, and those less seriously injured proportionately less. Lord Allenby has learnt that there is a wide-spread feeling of dissatisfaction at the smallness of these indemnities, and he himself feels strongly that the compensation paid has, in the majority of cases, been inadequate in view of the fact- that an average year&apos;s salary would probably be about  25, which cannot be regarded as fair compensation to the widows or children of men whose lives have been lost in the service of Great Britain.It must be remembered that if these men had been seriously incapacited, or had lost their lives whilst serving in the Egyptian Army, they or their widows and369   [5029]
children would, by the terms of the Egyptian Military Pension Law, be entitled to email pensions varying from about 17s. to 38s. a month, which are much more suited to the needs of a somewhat thriftless population than a cash gratuity which is soon spent, leaving the recipients destitute and discontented.Lord Allenby urges corresponding increases in the amount of indemnities for lesser injuries for which a capital&apos;sum of about  100,000 will be required, whilst the liability for pensions is estimated to amount to about  50,000 per annum.Lord Allenby feels strongly that this money should be found from British funds, and the question has indeed been referred to the War Office, though in the present difficult financial situation it is realised that it&quot; will be a matter of grave difficulty to give it favourable consideration.In these circumstances, it is suggested for consideration, whether a possible compromise on the main issue with the Egyptian Government might not be found in an immediate and equal division of the surplus Cotton Control funds on the understanding that His Majesty&apos;s Government would voluntarily surrender to the Egyptian Govern-ment one-half of their share for the relief of injured members of the Labour Corps and the dependents of those who lost their lives.C. of K.December 1, 1920.
