(Reference Cabinet 63(20), Conclusion 8.)The Committee have already furnished an Interim Re ort (C.P.2155) recommending that as from November 2nth, 1:^20 the prioe of sugar should be reduced from l/- to lOd. a lb. retail and the price of flour by 4/- a sack.      The Cabinet have accepted these recommendations.     The present Report makes recommendations as to the future policy of the Government in regard to sugar and wheat.1. General situation.   The Sugar Commission hold a stock of 700,000 tons of su^ar, i.e. 7 months supply.     This stoci was purchased at approximately  106 a ton.     The government are pledged to charge for su^ar prices which are adjusted from time to time &quot;to the ruling world price&quot; or which corres-pond with the &quot;prices ruling In the world1s market&quot;. It has therefore been impossible to avoid reducing the price of. government sugar to 104. a lb - equal to  80 a ton in accordance with the recent fall it the world1y price.     h further reduction may become necessary.   There is probably no ascer-paroels. of &quot;free&quot; sugar are offered in LondonSECRET,Copy Mo.CP.2216.SUGAR.tainable &quot;world&apos;s price&quot; ?t the moment;   small
at  91 a ton, the Committee have, hoard that a considerable quantity (4,000 tons) is being of..&apos;ored at a price or  66 a ton, duty paid, and more is offered from Paris at prices equiva-lont to  64 a ton, duty paid gjc wharf.     On the other h- nd it is believed that the cost of piodjction of subar delivered duty paid is about  73 a ton end it is not improbable that there will be 8 recovery in the world1a price.   The Committee are aware that the ultimate loss on realisation of the su^ar stocks will require a vote to replace advances from the Civil Contingencies fund.    The loss on re-sale may amount to between  12 and  80 millions.   This will involve the non-delivery of  7 millions now owed to the vote of credit and a supplementary vote for the balance.Sugar Refiners are unwilling to resume their normal business without Government assistance -they state that their capital is inadequate;   they claim that 5 times the capital is now required as compared with pre-war conditions and they fear to commence trading on their own account on a falling market and subject to the menace of Government stoc,:s which may be forced for sale.     Before the war raw sugar was imported from the Continent and it was possible to obtain supplies within a weeic;   now the Continental supply is very limited and su^ar has to be obtained from Java and Cuba, necessitating much heavier forward contracts.     Bather than run the risks involved incarrying large stocks th; minors alljg.i that th.!ywould prjf )r to oIob.3 their wor.:s.
 e   Suggested, bergain viitli the  u^ar Refiners.The Committee consider that escape shouldbe made from this position at tho earliest possible moment end along the lines of taking into partner-ship tho refiners end ma :ing them share tho ris.es of tho morfcat with the Government.      The Committee reoommonc     that An agreement should bo mado by the Government with the refiners whereby the former would under-ta^e to sell part of their requirements to tho refiners at market price i.e. the same prioe as the Refiners purchase the balance, of their requirements for the following month, the refiners undertaking to purchase a regularly increasing proportion of their requirements on.the open m*r 8t and not from the Government.   Thus the refiners would begin by talcing say 80 per cent of their supplies from the Sugar Commission and 20 per cent from the ma rice t, with a periodic reduction of purchases from the Government and increase in pur-chases from the market and so on until Government stocks were cleared completely and refiners were once more doing independent business.The Committee thin;: that the proposed negotia-tions with the refiners should be placed in the hands of the Food Controller, who should be authorised to offer, a reasonable credit of from 4 to 6 weei;s to the refiners for tae su6ar sold to them th*   assisting them with wording capital.     Thiii removes any menace from &quot;the forced sale of Government stocks and meets to some extent&apos; the shortage of capital by easing the purchase of
stocks whilo^it limits the risk to. the refiner of aay fall in the market.3*    germination of control.Although the rationing restrictions are being removed, the Committee do not recommend that the re-restrictions on importation, or the voucher system should be abolished until the agreement referred to above has been negotiated.     They consider that these restrictions are necessary for the proper disposal of Government stocks of sugar.$ *     Summary of recommendations in regard to gugar.(l)   rj)hat the Food Controller should be authorised to negotiate with the sugar refiners an agreement on the lines suggested in para-graph S ab ove;.(8)   ffhat when this agreement has been negotiations-ed the Government should announce that the sugar control is in process of liquidation,and that all restrictions on the importation and sale of sugar wholesale are withdrawn;(3)   That for the purpose of liquidation the Food Controller should bo authorised to take control of the operations of the Sugar Commission;(4)   rfhat no further purchases of sugar should be made by the Sugar Commission.
WHEAT.General Position.Tho Government roservos of broad-stuffs including the &quot;emergency&quot; stocks of flour amount to 700,000 tons in terms of flour, or frj- weeks cons imp ti on.    In addition, millers hold 300*000 tons on Government account and bakers 200,000 tons On their own account, the total approximating to 11^ weeks consumption.   Further some 5 weeks consumption of home-grown wheat will be marketed throughout the remainder of the cereal year.Prices have fallen rapidly, and wheat and flour can now be freely brought to this country at a figure well below Wheat Commission selling prioes, which are based on 116/6d. per quarter of wheat, and 86/- per saok of flour.   Tho Royal Commission^ stocks will therefore have to be liquidated at a loss unless an artii &apos;.cial price is maintained by prohibition of imports of wheat and flour vvhich is not thought possible.     The Cabinet has already authorised areduction of 4/- a saok in the sale price of flour.The Committee recommend that authority be given for further reductions when necessary to bring the selling price into relation with the importeI price*There are three main difficulties in carrying out the de-cohtrel of wheat.(a) The agreement with the Millers.(b) The Government stocks at relatively high prices.(e)   The right of the farmer, so long as wheat is controlled, to receive &quot;the equivalent of the .c*i.f. cost of imported wheat not exceeding 95/-t per quarter until the 31st August, 1921.
(a)   The Agreement with the members of tho Incorporated National Association of British and Irish Killers, Ltd., provides, inter alia, that the Food Controller shall give si:: months 1 notice of termination of the period of control; that the Association; if It thinks, it unreasonable or unfair that the period of control should cease, may bring the matter before the Tribunal; the Tribunal, to consist of a High Court Judge, two nominoos of tho Pood Controller and two of the Association, may extend the period of control.Under the agreement the Millers are guaranteed profits oqulvalont to tho mills standard, whioh may be taken roughly to be tho pre-war standard, with adjustments for IncroaaocL capital, special services, etc.There are 582 members of the Association, many of them small up-oountry firms, who fear that after de-control they will suffer from competition from the port millers and foreign imported flour.The millers also fear re-entering trade on thair own account on a falling market; thoy are without stocks of. their own. .      ;.Some of tho larger millers may not object to de-control, but it is felt oertain that substantial advantages will have to be: offered to induce the millers to consent to vary the existing.-agreement.
(b) Although a lose on realisation/the stocks is inevitable, it will not involve a new vote, although the anticipated saving on the Bread, Subsidy may disappear, and an asset nay be realised at less than was anticipated.( c) The-English wheat grower has be&amp;n informed that he isto be entitled to receive the world*s price for his wheat, not exceeding 9?/- a crfc*   If an absolute precaution ie necessary to prevent him receiving more than 95/&quot;? it will be necessary to maintain the control until the 31et -August, 19-21. If, however., the market looks like being under 95/- and what-ever risk of it rising above that price is run, then control need not on this account be maintained.2*        Suggested New Agreement with the rollers.The Committee propose that a policy similar to that suggested above in the case of sugar should be followed in   -regard to wheat,, and that negotiations with the millers should be opened to obtain, if possible a new agreement which will bring to an end control        in the early Spring and which will relieve the Wheat Commission by degrees of the responsibility of making further purchases and enable current stocks and commitments to be liquidated.     The Food Controller should be authorised to conduce negotiations with the millers for this purpose.3-   Emergency stool? of flour^In this connection the Committee desire to $raw the attention of the Cabinet to the fact that the Wheat Commission are at present&apos;carrying an &quot;emergency^ etock of flour to provide against a sudden stoppage of the railways or similar disturbances.     The Commission have 140,000 tone of flour valued at  4-1 million  at strategic points in this country.    This quantity is ten times what would be kept under ordinary circumstances and storage loss &quot;by depreciation, and . other charges are very serious.    They may amount to  li millions- 7 -
per annum.The Committee think that the attention of the Cabinet should he drawn to the position, and that the Cabinet should decide what action should be taken in regard to it.The Cabinet may also consider what, if any, stock of wheat should be held as an insurance against stoppage of supplies due to war*If any precautions are to be taken on either head it might be necessary to make special stipulations in the proposed agreement with the millers.4, Summary of recommendations in regard to &quot;Wheat.(l) That authority be given for further reduction from time to time in the price of flour to bring it into relation with $urrent world prices of imported wheat and flour;(2) That the Pood Controller should be authorised to negotiate with the fillers an agreement on the lines suggested in paragraph 2 above;(3) That when the agreement in question has been negotia-ted the Government should announce that the &quot;Wheat Commission is in liquidation and should take steps to abolish the control as quickly as possible and that on de-control English Wheat should be freed from the limit of 95/- a quarter;(4) That any further purchases of wheat should be made by the Wheat Commission.(5) That for the purpose of liquidation under the agree-ment with the Millers the Wheat Commission should be placed under control of the Pood Controller.( Signe d)   L.
