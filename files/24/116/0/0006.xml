an E CHUT,.P. 2206.CABIHT,UPPER SILESIA.Copy of a letter from the prime Minister to the Polish and German charges d&apos;Affaires in London.(Circulated for information.)10, Downing Street, S.W.Very urgent. ...      ,       ,nnn -----^-                                              3ftth November, 1920.SirI have the honour to inform you that the British, French and Italian Governments, animated &quot;by the desire that the plebls-cite, which is shortly to be held in Upper Silesia in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, shall take place in such a manner as will permit every duly qualified voter to record his or her vote under conditions of oamplete impartiality and. tranquility, have given their most careful consideration to the possibility that the voting may be disturbed and even impeded by a strict and literal interpretation in practice of the terms of section 4 of the annex to article 88 of the treaty, which provides that &quot;every person&quot; shall &quot;vote in the commune where he is domiciled or in which he was born, if he has not retained his domioile in the area&quot;.2. Coneeivin-T: it their duty to forestall in advance any danger of such disturbances as mi^ht prejudice the free exercise of the suffrage by any section of properly qualified voters, the three governments have anxiously examined the facts of the situa-tion as it has been represented to them by the Upper Silesia plebiscite Commission and by the Polish and German Governments,the result of that examination, they have unanimously decided to make to the polish and German Governments the following proposal 3. The last clause of section 4 of the above-mentionedKon. Jan. cieohanowski   &amp;q ., &amp;c., Ffrr, Albert puftur-^eronco, &apos; c -, &amp;c .,annexjkis documffi is m property of his britactc majesty&apos;s g-oyfrmfjpt) .
annoi: ruiio as follov.8: &quot;&apos;x!he result of one vota must be determined by communes according to the majority of votos in oach commune.&quot;   The British, French and Italian governments are&apos; of opinion that, provided that the votes of persons born, but not actually resident, in the sroa, fire eventually, for the purposes of the final resultt distributed emon^&apos; the communes in which those persons were born *nd added to the votes of the residents in those communes, it will not be inconsistent with the spirit of the olsuse cited above, if the actual recording of the votes of the non-residents taces place at some point outside the   rea.   The three Governments desire to draw attention to the fact that, if the Polish ^nd German Governments accept this view, it will   become possible to arrange for the votes of the non-residents to be recorded under conditions which, by removing the credent apprehension of disturbances in Upper Silesia, should give satisfaction both to the Polish and to the German Governments.   The conditions which seem to the throe governments best calculated to satisfy those requirements are as follows. All persons not resident in Upper Silesia, but qualified by their place of birth to ta/:e part in the plebiscite, m%ht b8 concentrated at somo point, such as Cologne or at several points, In the part of Germany at present in the occupation of Allied forces, there to record their votes u:.der the supervision of a sub-commission of the Upper Silesia Plebiscite Commission, which would be appointed by the Allied Governments for the purpose. , The administrative details Involved in this proposal will, ifit
it be accepted, require to be worked out by the Upper Silesia Plebiscite Commission under instructions from the Conference of Ambassadors, and need not be discussed here.,   For the moment the three Governments wish merely to emphasize the fact that the proposal affords a full guarantee that the vote of the non-residents shall be taken freely. Impartially and without disorder..4,   There are. however, two points which it may be convenient to elucidate at this stags05,   In the first place., the reason why the three Governments suggest the occupied territory of Germany as the district where the vote of the non-residents should be recorded is, not merely the safeguard afforded by the presence of an adequate allied military force9 but the fact that the majority of the out-voters are understood- to be actually resident in germany   It is believed also that access to the occupied territory would be not inconvenient for any qualified voters whom it may be desired to transport from overseaso60     In the second place, it will be for the Upper Silesia Plebiscite Commission, in the exercise of their powers under the treaty, to decide whether.or not, If the present proposal be accepted, the out-voters shall vote on the same day or days, as those on which the plebiscite is held in Upper Silesia,, or whether more than one day shall be allowed for the recording of their votes,,   These are questions on which the three Governments do not wish to anticipate the decision of the Commission,.-
It will, however, be perceived from the second sentence of paragraph 3 above that, under tho present proposal, the result of the plobisoito cannot be known, ma oh lose that it can bo published, until the votes of the non-residents have been added, commune by commune, to those of the residents.    ,The Plebiscite Commission would nwt, in the opinion of thethroo Governments have power to make known at different dates the results of the voting   of either body of voters.7. On behalf of the throe Governments I havethe honour to express the hope that; in order that thePolishnoosesary measures nay bo taken without delay, the Gorman Government will give to this proposal their immediate and favourable consideraticn and will inform the Conference tjf Ambassadors of the result at a very early moment.8. A similar note has been addressed to theGermanPolish Charge d&apos;Affalres at this Court.I have the honour to be, with high consideration, Sir,Your most obedienthumble servant,(Pinned)     D. LLOYD GEORGE.
