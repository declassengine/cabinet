31S DOOUIiEMT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS J3RIT ANNI0&apos; MAJESTY1S GOVIOTliENT).&quot;NFIDHNTIA.L.&apos; 0 A B I N E T.,P. 2S61.1* LEAGUE nF NATIONSMANDATES.THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE LEAGUE UNDER ARTICLE 22OF THE COVENANTMemorandum from tho Gorman Government concerning the fate of tho former German Colonies.Note from the Secretary-General:Tnn Secretary-General has the honour to forward herewith to tho Members of tho League the following ifemcrandum which he has received from the Gorman Minister for Foreign Affairs.I.Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which determines the fate of the former German colonies, solemnly affirms that the welfare and development of the races inhabiting these colonies is a sacred duty entrusted to civilisation, and that the best method of putting this principle into practical effect is to entrust&apos; these races to tho protection of nations in an advanced stage of development, who will exercise this protection as mandatories in the name of the League.      It follows from the above that the League of Nations has itself assumed the care of and responsibility for the former German Colonies .Though some particular State, and not the League of Nations, is responsible for the administration of these colonies, the duty of designating such States falls upon the League.-    Any other construction is incompatible with both tho letter and the spirit of the Covenant.  . The States to be selected are Mandatories of the League and fulfil their task under its orders and in its name.    Further, a ilanda&amp;ory of the League can only be appointed by the League itself. Therti is no suggestion in the Covenant that the League can leave the task of nominating Mandatories to&apos; any other authority.-The Covenant further lays down that the nature of the mandate is to vary according to the special conditions prevailing in the territories in question and to the stage cf development roaohod by their inhabitants.      In colonies the mandate is to take tho form of a direct administration. In this respect, the Covenant draws a distinction between two classes of colonies for which it contemplates different administrative arrangements.      Nevertheless, for both classes it lays down certain identical obligations which arebindingm
binding upon ih* Mandatories and from which tho latter may not depart.      In all oasoa tho Mandatory Power must submit to the Leaguo an annual roport upon tho territories entrust-od to It.-     Furthor, the extent to whioh oaoh Mandatory Power shall exercise authority, control or administrative powers is to bo tho subject of special arrangement. Paragraph 8 of article 22 explicitly states the authority omnipotent to determine tho Mandatory conditions.      In tho first place, theso conditions must bo decided by a Qorrv^n-tion between the Members of the League.      As all the Members of tho League, only meet in the Assembly, It is obvious that such a Convention can only take tho form of a resolution passed by the Assembly.       The Council is only called upon to take action if such a resolution in nat passed.      For this reason the Assembly of the League is -now perfectly free to take ouch action as it may think fit.As regards the exercise of the control vootod in the League, an important task falls on the Permanent Commission of the League which is provided for by the Covenant,, As the method of appointment of the uemUers of this Oommis-nion is not provided for by tho Covenant, the Inference is that it is the Assembly of the League which will have to deal with this question in the first instance.      Further, tho responsibility assumed by the League of Nations as a result of the institution of the mandate system implies that the assembly cannot refrain from taking. art in tho control of the Mandatory Powers.      Therefore the arrango-raents by which the Council receives the annual reports of tho Mandatory Powers and takes the opinion of the Permanent Commission cannot be regarded as incompatible with the intervention of the Assembly.II.The German Government was surprised to learn by tne publication in the Official Journal of the League for Septonber,. 1920, of the Minutes of the Eighth Meeting of the Council, that the latter had received a report regarding the obligations placed on the League.Vy Article 22 of the Covenant&quot;, a report which gave a totally different intorpre-tation cf the provisions in question.The report in&apos;question endeavours to make out that the appointment of tho Mandatory Powers and the delimitation of the territories whioh are to be placed under mandates is .exclusively within tho sphere of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers;   it only leaves to the League, that is to say to the Council, the purely formal duty of notifying tho appointments which have been made with regard to this or that State.      V.Tith this objoct the roport has based itself chiefly on Articles 118 and 119 of the Treaty of Versailles, by the terms of which Germany renounces in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all rights, titles and privileges whatsoever in er ooncerning all oversea territories, and by the torms of whioh aho undertakes further to recognise and accept the steps which may bo taken by tho aforomontionod Powers, in agreement, if nocossary, with other Powers, with a view to the settlement of the sit-uation arising from this renunciation.       These provisions are, nevertheless, net of a kind to justify an interpretation of
of Article 22 of the covenant differing from that which had been not forth above. In fact, regarded as a whole, the provisions can only have one meaning, that is that the Principal Allied and Associated Powers should hold the Colonial possessions as trustees, till such time as the Mandatories are appointed. It was necessary to make this provisional arrangement because otherwise those possessions would have been abandoned during a period from the coming into force of the Peace Treaty until the appointment of the Mandatories. In this respect the session of the above mentioned possessions to the Principal Powers may be compared to the cession of the territory of Danzig, as provided by Article 100 of the Treaty of Versailles. Besides, the answer given under date June 16th, 1919, to the observations submitted by the German Peace Delegation, regarding the conditions of peace, explicitly confirms the view that the cession of the colonies to the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in no way implied the right of these Powers to appoint the Mandatories. In fact, in its remarks concerning Section IV of the Treaty of Versailles, this reply states under heading III in regard to Mandatories that the latter "being constituted stewards by the League of Nations will not derive any profit from such steward ship." That opinion bears out the view expressed the report already mentioned, according to which the Principal Powers intended, when they drew up the conditions of peace, to retain for themselves the right to appoint the Mandatories. But even supposing that they had such an intention, this would not in the least affect the legal aspect of the matter. For it is an accepted principle, that in interpreting an international treaty no value can be attached to the intentions of one of the contracting parties, except in so far as these intentions have been expressed either explicitly or by implication in the provisions of the treaty. The result is, therefore, that the Principal Allied Powers cannot escape the duty of taking the necessary stops to ensure a result in conformity with the Covenant in respect of the Mandatory system.

As regards the fixing of the conditions of mandates, it is stated in the report already referred to that by "members" in the sense of paragraph 8 of Article 22 are to be understood not the Assembly of the League,  but the Signatory Powers of the Peace Treaty, so far as they are Members of the League of Nations. Now there are absolutely no grounds for excluding in this way the Members of the League who were not among the belligerents. Furthermore, the Report declares that a convention drawn up with the aid of all the Signatory Powers would hardly be practicable owing to the immense number of the signatories. It is for this reason that the Council of the League, who would be competent if there were no such convention, appear to have refrained from undertaking itself the determination of the conditions itself and to have decided to let them be determined by the Principal Powers. The latter would, therefore, confront the Council with a fait accompli, so much so that its part in the matter would in fact be limited to notifying the arrangement made to the Mandatories. It is clear that by proceeding in this fashion tho Council would be frequently violating the  obligation imposed on it in paragraph 8.

Then, again, the Council proposes to convene the Members of the Mandatory Commission, whereas that task, as has already been explained, should fall to the Assembly of the League. The instructions drawn up by the Council for the composition of the Commission-provide that each Mandatory Power, in its capacity
capacity as a Mandatory, shall be represented by one delegate; and that in addition to these State delegates, a certain number of members shall be appointed from among private individual nationals of other States. It is appropriate to observe that such a system would prejudice the effectiveness of the task allotted to the Commission, seeing that the delegates of the Mandatory Powers would necessarily have to be considered as interested parties, and that the private members would not be able to maintain their opinions with the same authority as the State representatives. The situation would be the same if, as might occur, the Delegate of the State whose mandate is under consideration should find himself precluded from asking part in the voting.

III.

Soon as a whole, the system proposed by the Council of the League amounts to the almost complete elimination of the Assembly, and it reduces the role of the Council to a mere formality, and it thus invalidates the control vested in the League. The Mandatory system would therefore become a mere fiction, and we should find ourselves confronted, in fact, with the annexation of the former German colonial possessions, through a distribution carried out by the Principal Powers. The German Government, for its part, would be bound to consider such a solution of the colonial question as a violation of the Treaty of Versailles, of which the Covenant of the League of Nations forms an integral part.

The German Government has not merely a formal, but a very practical, interest in endeavouring to prevent any such violations. Germany has a right to be considered when in due course the final distribution of mandates is undertaken. Therefore, the German Government cannot be indifferent to the question of knowing who is to allot those mandates and what system is to be adopted in deciding the conditions under which they are to be exercised.

For the above reasons the German Government has the honour to request the Assembly of the League of Nations to be good enough to discuss the question of Colonial Mandates, and to see that the steps taken are in conformity both with the letter and the spirit of Article 22 of the Covenant. If this appeal should be unsuccessful, the German Government desires, at once, to protest solemnly against this violation of the Covenant, and, as regards the future, reserves its rights concerning this question.
