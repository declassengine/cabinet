[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet,   December 1920.SECRET. C.P.-2243.CABINET. O_ . H\ . OLAND SETTLEMENT COMMITTEE. Final Report on the Land Settlement of ex-Service Men in Scotland.(Sir Robert Home and Mr. Montagu have been unable to attend the meetings of the Committee and are not prepared to express any opinion on the recommendations contained in this Final Report.)1. In the Interim Report (CP.-1915) this Committee dealt with the problem of the Land Settlement of fit and disabled ex-service men in England and Wales. The recommendations contained in that report were subsequently approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 52 (20), Conclusion 5), and the Committee understand that steps are now being taken to put those recommendations into force,2. This final report is concerned with the problem of Land Settlement of fit and disabled ex-service men in Scotland. In addition to the relevant Cabinet papers on the subject, the Com-mittee have been supplied with memoranda and other documents by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, and have taken evidence from Sir R. P. Wright, the Chairman of that Board, Sir R. B. Greig, a member of the Board, and Sir A. Rose, the Director of Land Settlement in Scotland, from Colonel J. D. Sutherland, formerly a member of the Board and Commissioner for Small Holdings under the Board, and from Sir-K. Mackenzie, Bart., King&apos;s and Lord Treasurers Remembrancer.3. The history of Land Settlement in Scotland differs entirely from the history of Land Settlement in England. In Scotland land settlement has been a continuing process ever since 1885. The process stopped at the outbreak of war, with the result that the post-war period was started with a large accumulation of applications which would in the ordinary way have been dealt with in the years 1914-1918. This consideration is important, as the civilian demand for holdings, especially in the crofting districts, is one of long standing which cannot be disregarded.Nature of Land Settlement in Scotland.[5065]4. Generally speaking, Land Settlement in Scotland is of two distinct types: (a.) Settlements in the non-crofting parishes (which include the whole of twenty-six counties and portions of three), where the holdings consist mainly, if not entirely, of arable laud:(6.) Settlements in the crofting parishes (which include the whole of four counties and portions of three), where the holdings are for the most part pastoral. In this category are included &quot; enlargements,&quot; or additions to existing small crofts necessary to make the latter capable of yielding a livelihood to the occupiers and their families. These enlargements are, in respect that little or no equipment is required, comparable with the &quot; bare land &quot; settlement in England and Wales.B
2Settlement in non-Orofting Counties.5. In comparing settlements in non-crofting parishes with similar settlements in England, it has been represented to the Committee that there is practically no demand in Scotland for the allotment or market-garden type of holding, and it is said that this absence of demand is due partly to the fact that the English village community does not exist in the Lowlands to anything like the same extent as in England, and partly because the climate, soil, and distance from markets do not permit in most districts of the economic establishment of very small holdings. Accordingly, to satisfy the demand in the non-crofting counties for miniature farms equipped as such, the policy of the Board of Agriculture has been to provide houses and farm buildings in practically every case. The Board have not practised the provision of &quot; bare land &quot; in the Lowlands.Settlement in Crofting Counties.General Financial Arrangements.Nature of the Problem :(1.) Present Cost of Settlement.6. There is nothing in England and Wales at all comparable with the settlements in the crofting parishes which present a problem peculiar to the districts concerned. The result of the war has been to intensify the difficulties in these crofting districts. The inability of the State quickly to provide the very large number of ex-service and civilian applicants with holdings near their homes has led to numerous seizures of and threats to seize land, and the difficulties are accentuated by the absence in most of the crofting parishes of any trades or industries other than agriculture, fishing and, to a minor degree, forestry, while for the time being the abnormally high price of sheep stocks makes pastoral settlement a hazardous and speculative venture.7. Under Section 26 of &quot; The Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919,&quot; a sum of  2,750,000 (representing the Scottish equivalent of the  20,000,000 provided for England and Wales under Section 14 of &quot; The Land Settlement (Facilities; Act, 1919&quot;), may, during the period ending the 23rd December, 1921, be issued by the Treasury to the Public Works Loan Board, which may make loans to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the purposes specified in the section. In accordance with the Ministerial arrangement referred to in paragraph 6 of the Interim Report, this sum of  2,750,000 is reduced to approximately  2,417,000.8. Of this sum of  2,417,000 the amount actually issued by the Public Works Loan Board up to the 21st August last is only  300,850, but the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have up to that date incurred commitments estimated to amount in all to about  2,152,000. The unallocated balance (approximately  264,000) is being held as a reserve to meet urgent cases. The available funds ( 2,417,000) will, it is estimated, provide for approximately 1,284 ex-service applicants, of whom three-fifths will be settled in the crofting and two-fifths in the non-crofting&apos; districts.9. The net average cost of settling small-holders in Scotland on present lines under Part I of the Act of 1919 and under &quot;The Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts, 1886-1919,&quot; has hitherto been as follows: Acts 1886-19111.Settlement in crofting parishes  (a.) New holding (arable) (I.) New holding (pastoral) .. (c.) Enlargement (arable) (d.) Enlargement (pastoral) ..Settlement in non- crofting parishes  New holding (arable)1,417 694 703 347

In England a very large number of applicants can be satisfied by the offer of &quot; bare&quot; land; in Scotland the demand for &quot; bare &quot; land is negligible, and in practically every case the holdings have to be equipped with buildings, &amp;c.(2.) The larger average size of the Scottish arable holding (over all Scottish average 36 acres, as against 15 acres in England).-(3.) In Scotland, on the average, each holder is granted a loan of  200 for stock acquisition, whereas in England stock is provided by means of loans with a State guarantee granted to holders by the banks.(2.) Number of Applicants.11. The total number of ex-service applicants for new holdings and enlargements on the 6th November, 1920, was 5,220. Of these 1,284 have been, or will be, provided for out of funds now available, leaving a balance of 3,936, which for this purpose may be assumed to be a net figure. If a time-limit for applications is imposed a 1,000 additional ex-service applications may be expected, making a total of 6,220 approved ex-service applicants. To this figure should be added 1,000 enlargements, nominally for civilians, but used actually as a means of satisfying a large number of ex-service men or their dependants in the crofting parishes. The total figure is therefore 7,220, of whom 1,284 can be satisfied out of available funds, leaving to be dealt with (say) 6,000 applicants made up as follows : 	For New	For	Holdings.	Enlargements. sApplicants in crofting parishes	3,000	1,000In non-crofting parishes	2,000	Total	5,000	1,000Disabled ex-Service and Civilian Applicants.12. In addition to the above fit ex-service applicants there are approximately 500 disabled ex-service applicants and 3,000 (2,000 in crofting parishes) civilian applicants for new holdings and 3,500 (nearly all in crofting parishes) civilian applicants for enlargements.10. It will be observed that in England the average cost per holding in the past has been  950, and this figure may be corn-pared with the average cost of providing new holdings under the Scottish Act of 1919. The figures indicate that for each  1,000,000 approximately 1,050 holders can be settled in England and &quot;Wales as against the following numbers in Scotland : 
Estimated Cost of Providing for Present and Prospective Demands.Cost of Providing for Disabled ex-Service Men.The total demand (exclusive of future civilian applicants) is therefore: 	Ex-service.

Any estimate of the additional capital cost of providing for the 6,000 fit ex-service applicants referred to above must be taken with great caution, but on the assumption that the men can be provided with holdings at approximately the same average cost ruling hitherto, and that about one-tenth of the arable holdings will be in crofting counties, the additional net cost of settlement under Part I of the 1919 Act and under &quot; The Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts, 1886-1919,&quot; would be approximately as follows: --	No. of; Approved Applicants.

The above figures make no allowance for the 500 disabled men. It is estimated that on the same basis an extra amount of  650,000 will be required to settle these men on suitable small holdings.15. So far, therefore, as the ex-service problem is concerned, the financial position is as follows : Estimated cost of providing for 1,284 fit applicantsout of existing funds Estimated cost of providing for 6,000 further fit appli-cants under Part 1 of 1919 Act Estimated cost of providing for 500 disabled appli-CtintS * a * * * * t a a *Total.. 2,417,000 8,761,400 650,00011,828,40016. If account is taken on the same basis of the civilian appli-cants an additional  6,800,000 would be required or, omitting civilian applicants in the non-crofting parishes, an additional  4,440,000.17. In order, therefore, to dispose of the Scottish ex-service claims and the claims of civilians on the lines hitherto adopted a total capital expenditure of at least  18,000,000 would have to be contemplated.
Annual Losses.18. To complete the survey of the financial position it is necessary to refer to the heavy annual losses involved in the scheme of land settlement now in operation. It is estimated that the present commitments ( 2,152,585) will involve a deficit in the first year of  90,000, and that only after twenty-five years will the annual deficit fall to not less than  40,001) on this basis the initial annual deficit mi the estimated  11,828,400 needed to settle the ex-service problem would amount to  500,000 per annum, or, including the civilians, to about  750,000 per annum.Coat of any Scheme on Present Lines Prohibitive.Economies.19. While the Committee realise that it is quite out of the question for the Exchequer to provide for capital and other expenditure to anything like the extent indicated in the preceding paragraph, they apprehend that it would be difficult to maintain that the pledge to the ex-service man in Scotland was satisfied by the provision of holdings for only 1,500 Scottish applicants  approximately the number which it will be possible to settle on present lines if Scotland is accorded financial treatment on the lines recommended in the case of England and Wales in paragraphs 33 et seq of the Interim Report. In these circumstances the Committee have carefully investigated the possibility of effecting substantial economies within the existing scheme, and make certain recommenda-tions in later paragraphs, which, if adopted, would in the aggregate materially reduce the capital expenditure.Administration.20. In England and Wales the policy has been to carry out the scheme of land settlement mainly through the agency of the county councils under the general supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Agriculture. In Scotland, on the other hand, the administration of both the Small Landholders Act of 1911 and the Land Settlement Act of 1919 is wholly centralised in the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, no powers or duties of any kind being entrusted to the county councils or other local bodies in Scotland. It has been represented to the Committee that the present centralised administra-tion is responsible for the slow progress made and the costly character of the present scheme. On the other hand, it is stated that the slow progress is due (1) to the fact that the Act of 1919 only operated as from December 1919 (or four months later ihan the English Act); (2) to the difficulties of obtaining possession of land owing to the fact that land was, as a rule, held on long lease ; (3) to delays incidental to building operations ; and (i) to the uncertain financial future of the scheme. Alter very careful consideration the Committee have come to the conclusion that the objections to transferring the control and management of Land Settlement in Scotland to the county councils or other representative bodies are insuperable. Further, the Committee are doubtful as to the desirability of giving such bodies advisory or consultative functions so long as the entire financial responsibility rests with the Exchequer. In this connection it may be mentioned that the Committee are satisfied that no financial contribution from the rates can be looked for in Scotland, either now or in the future. Assuming, therefore, the continuation of a centralised administration, the Committee are satisfied that the best results will be attained if measures are taken to secure that Land Settlement in Scotland is in future administered by the Director of Land Settlement, responsible only to the Secretary for Scotland, and witti direct access to that Minister.The Committee recommend : (I..) That in future Land Settlement for the whole of Scotland should be administered by the Director of Land Settle-ment.
(2.) That the Director of Land Settlement should be solely responsible to and should have direct access to the Secretary for Scotland on all matters connected with Land Settlement, and that the members of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland should be relieved of their present duties m these respects.(3.) That the arrangements for the control of the finance of Land Settlement should be reviewed in consultation with the Treasury, with a view to the adoption of some such system of control as now exists in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Possible Economies. 21. The Committee consider that economies can be effectedwithin the existing scheme in the following ways : (1.) By reducing the number of applicants.(2.) By acquiring land in future otherwise than for cash, andby adopting the practice of acquiring individual farmsalready equipped rather than large estates. (3.) By reducing the size of holdings and endeavouring toextend &quot; bare &quot; land settlement. (4.) By instituting a most rigid control over capital and other expenditure per holding. (5.) By limiting the amounts lent to applicants for purchase of 1 stock, &amp;c.Approval of 22. Having regard to the more generous character of the applicants benefits offered to Scottish applicants, the Committee consider thata substantially higher standard of knowledge, experience and capacity can properly be required than in the case of the average English applicant. While the Committee have no reason to suppose that the work of selection has not been carefully performed by the Board of Agriculture and the officials concerned, they have little doubt that the approved list of applicants contains a number of men who for one reason or another are unfitted to be given the care and management of farms of 40 acres and upwards. The Committee&apos;s criticisms con-tained in paragraph 24 of the Interim Beport apply equally to the provision of expensive arable farms in Scotland, which can only be made available at the expense of men willing to take less costly holdings. Generally the Committee think that the conditions of approval of an applicant should be made more exacting, and that it is in the best interests of the men themselves that care should be taken to avoid placing on the land men who will be quite unable to withstand the first period of agricultural depression. The Committee recommend: (1.) That, as in England, a definite time-limit should be imposed within which ex-service men must apply in order to be treated as eligible for the preference provided under the Act. Any ex-service applicants failing to apply within such time-limit to be eligible for the same treatment as ordinary civilian applicants.(2.) That the time-limit should be the 1st February, 1921, and that the Board of Agriculture for Scotland should publish this time-limit as widely as possible.(3.) That the preference for ex-service men be extended by Statute beyond December 1921 (when it will expire) for a further two years.(4.) That the Government pledge should be regarded as satis-fied by the offer to an applicant of suitable land at a reasonable rent, and that an applicant who refuses such an offer should be struck off the approved list.
(5.) That the approved list of applicants should be carefully scrutinised with a view to the removal from the list of all applicants (1) about whose ability and capacity to succeed as small farmers there can he any reasonable doubt; (2) whose^ financial resources are such as to render them unsuitable recipients of State aid, i.e., those who have substantial capital available for farming without State assistance.(6.) That an absolute preference should be given first to any suitable approved applicants willing to take up &quot; bare &quot; land and next to those who will take ancillary holdings. In this connection the Committee understand that at all events in the crofting parishes it is sometimes possible to meet the claim of an ex-service applicant by giving an &quot; enlargement&quot; to his father. The Committee would regard with favour the widest possible application of this practice.(7.) Applicants in the congested districts of the Western Islands should be offered holdings on the mainland, but the refusal of such an offer should not in itself involve the deletion of the applicants name from the approved list.(8.) The list of approved applicants should be sent to the Colonial Office with a view to that Department giving the applicants an opportunity of considering the advantages offered by the Overseas Settlement Com-mittee to suitable ex-service men willing to emigrate to the Dominions. It is estimated that a sum of  250 provided from Imperial funds would suffice to enable a family to emigrate.Provision of Land. 23. In Scotland settlements can be effected by two distinctmethods: (a.) The Board of Agriculture for Scotland may purchase or feu a property, thus taking for all purposes the place of the landlord. In these cases the financial return on the money expended varies considerably, but may be taken over all to average about 2 per cent, over a period of years.(b.) The Board, either by consent or by compulsion, may settle a farm or a property without acquiring the ownership. In such cases the Board has to provide funds for compensa-tion to the landlord and the tenant, loss on taking over sheep stocks, grants for roads, fences, &amp;c, and loans to holders for buildings, &amp;c. Under this heading the return on funds expended is almost negligible (below 1 per cent.) because much of the expenditure is in any case irrecoverable and where recoverable carries only low rates of interest.24. Up to the present the Board have acquired 240,072 acres under (a) and 78,294 acres under (&amp;). Most of the acreage under (a) has been bought outright, very little having been acquired on lease or by feuing. The policy of the Board has been to acquire (under (a) ) suitable estates and break them up for settlement rather than to purchase individual farms, as and when the latter come into the market. As a consequence of this policy the Board had, prior to Martinmas 1920, only obtained entry to about 68,000 acres out of the 240,072 acres, of which only 8,000 acres had been settled and about 60,000 acres were in hand. A further 2,300 acres came into the board&apos;s hands on the lltli November, 1920, making 62,300 acres in hand, of which, however,v54,400 acres were said to be on that date in process of settlement, leaving about 7,900 acres actually in hand at the present time
Size and Cost of Holdings. Arable Holdings.Cost of Holdings: Arable.25. In view of the imperative necessity of restricting capital expenditure, the Committee recommend (l.) That all settlements be carried out in future under Part II of the Act of 1919 or on lands acquired by lease or by feuing, or by any other method of annual payment,(2.) That the Treasury should be consulted with a view to seeing whether that Department would give a State guarantee to owners willing to feu their land, or in the alternative, whether owners could not be offered State annuities similar to the English county annuities.(3.) That the recommendations contained in paragraphs 20, 21 and 22 of the Interim Report respecting land owned by the Crown, the service departments and corporate bodies should be applied to Scotland.(4.) That the policy hitherto adopted of acquiring whole estates or large blocks of land should be definitely abandoned, and that every effort should be made to acquire single farms, with buildings adaptable for the purpose of small holdings, coming into the market, especially those of which vacant possession can be at once obtained.(5.) That the breaking up for settlement of central farms now being conducted by the Board of Agriculture should be expedited.(6.) That every effort should be made to increase the number of ancillary holdings and to extend &quot; bare &quot; land settlement.26. The average size of arable holdings in the Lowlands of Scotland is about 34 acres; in England and Wales the average size of a holding is 15 acres, which is now to be reduced to 13  acres (paragraph 23, Interim Report). The Committee, while appreciating the reasons which have led the Board of Agriculture to provide holdings of this size, see no sufficient justification for treating the arable applicants in Scotland very differently in this respect from the English applicants. At the same time, a slightly larger average holding may be warranted by the special conditions in Scotland, but the Committee think that it should be possible in future to reduce the average size of the arable holding.27. It is imperative that every effort should be made to persuade applicants to take &quot;bare&quot; arable laud or pastoral enlarge-ments, and that so far as possible land should only be acquired in those parts of Scotland where possibilities of work exist within a reasonable distance, so that small holdings with sufficient land for one or two cows (3 to 9 acres) may be provided as ancillary to the applicants livelihood. These holdings may with advantage be grouped with a few of larger size occupied by men with sufficient capital to keep a pair of horses for the use pf the community. Parts of Scotland, where there is no prospect of employment, should, so far as possible, be avoided for this class of holding. In this connection the Committee understand that the Forestry Commission may, in the next few years, be in a position to take over suitable approved applicants for forestry work. Those men might with advantage be provided with ancillary small holdings in the neighbourhood of their work, and the exact method by which this can best be done should be considered by the Departments concerned, in consultation, if necessary, with-the Treasury. 128. The capital cost per acre of arable holdings on land acquired for cash under Part I of the 1919 Act is  61, made up of land  22, equipment, &amp;c,  38, tenants&apos; valuations, &amp;c.,  1, the average gross and net cost per holding is  2,671&apos;* and  2,359** Non-crofting county figures.
respectively. The attention of the Committee has been drawn to certain typical holdings of which the following arable examples may be given : (a.) Holding, 43 acres : rent,  43 per annum; capital cost, 3,865 ; annual deficit for 23 years,  120 per annum;no annual surplus shown until after 58 years. (&amp;.) Holding, 13J acres: rent,  10 10s. per annum; capital cost (land feued),  978 ; annual deficit, 25 years,  53 perannum.The Committee recommend : &apos; (1.) That in the case of arable holdings a scale of maximum average capital cost per holding and maximum average annual loss per holding be drawn up by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, in collaboration with the Treasury, on the general lines of the scale contained in the Ministry of Agriculture^ circular of the 31st July, 1920, as recently modified to meet the situation arising out of the increase from 6 to 6j per cent, of the rate of interest on loans, and that, speaking generally, no arable holding should henceforth be created, the cost of which, exclusive of loans for stock, but inclusive of the capitalised value of the feu or annuity, exceeds  2,500. (2.) That only the absolute minimum of housing and steading accommodation be provided, and that expenditure on fencing, water supply and roads be reduced to the lowest level.Cost of Holdings: 29. The average cost per acre of holdings mainly pastoral onPastoral. the same basis is  3*11, made up of land,   &quot;76 ; sheep stocks,   &apos;74 ;equipment, &amp;c,   &apos;66 ; tenants&apos; valuations, stocking, &amp;c,   &quot;95. The average gross and net cost per holding is  1,317 and  1,184 respectively. As indicated above, the Committee feel considerable doubt as to the desirability of proceeding with the larger crofting settlements, and recommend : (1.) That the Board of Agriculture should, in collaboration with the Treasury, draw up and observe suitable scales of maximum average capital cost per holding, maximum average annual loss per holding, and maximum average expenditure on adaptation or equipment appropriate to pastoral holdings, and that, generally speaking, no pastoral holding should henceforth be created the cost of which, exclusive of loans for stock, but inclusive of the capitalised value of the feu or annuity, exceeds a limit to be fixed by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland and the Treasury in consultation.(2.) That only the absolute minimum of housing and steading accommodation should be provided, and that every effort should be made to induce the applicant to build his own house, &amp;c, with materials supplied by or through the Board.Gifts for Fencing, 30. Under section 7 (7) of &quot; The Small Landholders (Scotland)Act, 1911,&quot; the Board of Agriculture for Scotland may provide assis-tance by way of gift for fencing, roads, water supply and drainage. In present circumstances, the Committee see no sufficient reason why the cost of those items should not be borne by the small-holders, and accordingly recommend That no further gifts for these purposes be made, but that any necessary expenditure should be provided for by loans to small-holders at a low rate of interest, repayable by sinking fund.
Loans for Purchase of Stock.31. The Committee understand that it is not unusual for the Board to assist small-holders to purchase their stock by advancing as much as 75 per cent, of the value on loan, and that in some cases loans of even higher percentage have been granted. In England loans for this purpose are discouraged, but in any case no English applicant is ever granted a loan on more favourable terms than  1 for each  1 produced by himself. The Committee consider that it is mistaken kindness to lend substantial amounts to men who have neither cash nor credit; moreover, the very low rate of interest charged by the Board on these loans is a direct inducement to an unscrupulous applicant to understate his means.The Committee recommend (I.) That loans for purchase of stock should only be granted in future after a most careful investigation into the means of the applicant, and that in no case should the loan exceed 50 per cent, of the value of the stock to be purchased, and that loans of that proportion should only be granted in exceptional circumstances.(2.) That the Board of Agriculture for Scotland should not, as at present, be obliged to return to the Public Works Loan Commissioners moneys recovered from holders in respect of short-term stock, &amp;c, loans, but should be authorised to retain such moneys and utilise them as working capital.Estimate of Savings if Economies are-adopted.32. It is most difficult to estimate the capital sum which might be saved by the adoption of the economies indicated above, but on the assumption that the land can be acquired otherwise than for cash and that only the most economical kind of equipment is provided, it would seem that the claims of 6,000 fit ex-service applicants could be satisfied for approximately the following expendi-ture : [Holders.	Average Cost.	Total.	 	fPastoral, 3,000..	800	2,400,000Arable, 2,000	1,800	2,600,000Special enlargements, 1 ,000	500	500,000Total	* *	5,500,00033. To this sum of  5,500,000 would have to be added about  1,500,000 for the acquisition of sheep stocks, management, and landlords&apos; and tenants&apos; compensation, and loans for live-stock, implements, seeds, &amp;c. The gross provision would accordingly be about  7,000,000, of which about  1,200,000 would fall to be recovered within seventeen years in respect of the  1,500,000 acquisition of sheep stocks, &amp;c, leaving  5,800,000, which latter sum would be subject to gradual repayment by long-term annuities in respect of the building loans. If this expenditure was spread over a period of five years it would be necessary to find  1,600,000 in the first year, and a smaller sum in subsequent years, ending with  1,285,000 in the fifth year. A further capital sum of at least  500,000 would be required for the settlement of the disabled men. On the same basis the outstanding civilian applicants could be satisfied for about  5,000,000, so that the aggregate figures comparable with those given in paragraphs 14-17 above are : 
Estimated cost of providing for 1,284 fit applicants outof existing funds         ..         ..         ..         .. 2,417,000Estimated cost of providing for 6,000 further fit appliqants 5,800,000Estimated cost of providing for 500 disabled applicants,. 500,000Total ex-service        ..        .. 8,717,000Add estimated cost of providing for (a.) Civilian applicants in crofting districts   ..        .. 3,600,000(b.) Civilian applicants in non-crofting districts        .. 1,400,000Grand total...... 13,717,00034. It would thus appear that the result of enforcing all possible economies might be to reduce capital expenditure by about  4,000,000, and that the least additional capital amount necessary to dispose of existing demand from the ex-service men and civilians for Land Settlement in Scotland is about  11,000,000.35. The Committee realise that the advance to Scotland of a further capital sum of  333,000, bringing the total provision for Land Settlement in Scotland up to the sum of  2,750,000 allowed by section 26 of the Act of 1919, will not materially affect the position. It has been represented to them that Scotland might fairly be allowed the arrears of grant withheld during the war from the Agriculture (Scotland) Fund. The Committee have taken note of this suggestion, but they fully appreciate the serious objections which could be raised by the Treasury to giving Scotland exceptional and preferential financial assistance in this particular way.36. The Committee think, however, that the following considera-tions may be held to justify the grant to Scotland of special financial treatment: (1) The greater need as evidenced by the larger number of approved applicants in prop6rtion to the population. In this connection the Committee point out that the argument that Scotland should only be given the usual fraction of the money provided for England and Wales, disregards the important fact that the pledges to the ex-service men were given individually and not territorially; (2) the peculiar and pressing difficulties of Land Settlement in the crofting districts; and (3) the climatic and other conditions which inevitably render Land Settlement in Scotland more costly than in England.&apos;37. With a view to relieving the more pressing aspects of the problem and reducing the latter to more manageable proportions, the Committee recommend (1.) That a further sum of  333,000 (or a maximum of  2,750,000 in all) should be issued by the Treasury to the Public Works Loan Commissioners for the purpose of making loans to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.(2.) That statutory powers should be obtained to enable the Treasury to issue to the Public Works Loan Commis-sioners a further sum of  750,000 during the financial year 1921-22 for the purpose of making loans to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland.(3.) That the sums mentioned in (1) and (2) above ( 1,083,000 in all) should, during the financial year 1921-22, be devoted to Land Settlement in Scotland on the lines and subject to the conditions indicated in this report, the bulk of the money being allocated to the crofting districts.(4.) That in twelve months&apos; time the position of Land Settle-ment in Scotland should be again reviewed in the light
of the then general financial situation, and of the progress made with Land Settlement in Scotland in the twelve months.(Signed)     L. WORTHINGTON EVANS (Chairman). LEE.li. MUNRO. * CLINTON.

I have signed the Report of the Committee on Land Settlement, subject to the following reservations: I. Administration.I am unable to concur with, the recommendations with regard to the future administration of Land Settlement in Scotland contained in paragraph 20 of the Report. The proposals of the Committee would involve the creation of a new department charged with the administration of Land Settlement. This department would be divorced from the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, to which I look for advice on all agricultural matters, and would be attached to the Scottish Office, a Department which possesses no expert knowledge of agricultural questions. The objections to the creation of a new department at the present time, involving, as it would necessarily do, a considerable increase in the expenses of administration, are obvious, even if there were considerations of administrative efficiency in support of such a step. In my judgment administrative efficiency w&amp;uld not gain by the action proposed. The course recommended in the Report is not based upon any evidence which was laid before the Committee, and, indeed, is directly contrary to the evidence of the Director of Land Settlement, who stated that his association with the Board was a help to him and not a hindrance.Land Settlement in England proceeds under the supervision of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and I am not aware of any grounds on which a proposal to exclude the Board of Agriculture for Scotland from any part in the supervision of Land Settlement in that country could be justified.I must accordingly record my emphatic dissent from the recommendations above referred to.II. Loans for Purchase of Stock.I am unable to assent to the first recommendation in paragraph 31 of the Report in the form in which it stands. I am advised that, while it might be possible rigorously to apply the limitation on loans contained in the recommendation in the case of arable holdings, to apply it in the case of pastoral holdings would impose a very serious, if not insuperable, obstacle to the settlement of many ex-service men who are not possessed of, and could not find, 50 per cent, of the value of sheep stocks, which must be provided in the case of a pastoral holding. The Governments pledge to these men was not qualified by the requirement of any specified amount of capital, and I should view with much misgiving the imposition of a rule with regard to capital which would make it impossible for them to obtain holdings. The loans for sheep stocks are usually granted over club stocks, in the management of which the Board retain a share until the loan is paid off, and the system furnishes a reasonably good security for the loan.For these reasons I think it desirable that the recommendation should be expressed in less absolute terms, so as to leave the Board a discretion to advance, in cases where they think it expedient so to do, a higher proportion of the stock value than 50 per cent.ROBERT MUNRO.Scottish Office, December 2, 1920.RESERVATIONS BY LORD FORTEVIOT.I am sorry I am not able to agree entirely with the Report as approved by the Committee, and I should like the following notes inserted. It will be observed that my objections are mainly raised in regard to the crofting areas: Paragraph 20.-While I am not satisfied with the manner in which the Scottish Board of Agriculture has dealt with small holdings in the past, now that the staff of the Board has been reorganised and increased, and in view of the recent appointment of a&quot;RESERVATIONS BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.
Director of Land Settlement, I am in favour of the present arrangement being continued in the meantime. I do not think that the new proposals in paragraph 20 would add materially either to efficiency or economy.Paragraph 21, sub-section 2. I do&apos; not think there should be absolute restriction in purchasing whole estates, and in regard to sub-section 3, I am very strongly of opinion that any reduction in the size of holdings in the crofting counties would have the most disastrous results. Much of the misery in the congested districts is caused by so many of the present holdings being too small, and any movement which would continue this evil is not to be encouraged. So far as the crofting area is concerned, I am of opinion that it would be better to give no holding at all than to give one which is too small.Paragraph 25, sub-section 4, deals with the same question as paragraph 21, sub-section 2. In regard to this I have only to say the Board should not be absolutely prevented from acquiring large tracts of land if it is proved to be the most economical method.If paragraph 27 means that there should be any slackening in the efforts to get small holdings for men in the crofting area, where there is not much prospect of outside employment, I do not agree.9With the foregoing exceptions, I entirely agree with the Report.FORTE VIOT.o
