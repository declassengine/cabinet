That the infection of Typhus is Widely distributed in Russia and other countries adjoining Poland and opportunities for its distribution are constant and continually Increasing.4* That urgent necessity exists for an immediate and ade-quate effort, participated in by the nations of the-world, to successfully combat a menace which is international and. world-wide.Already two appeals have beon issued by the Council of the League and 42 States have been communicated with in an urgent request for a fund to a minimum of  2,000,000, with which, to undertake the limitation and possible extermination of the epidemic.   In answer to this appeal, tho 1&apos;ollovdng Nations havo promised to contribute, as shown hereunder; but that up to date nothing has been actually paid in owing to the conditional nature of the contributions offered,   as a consequence, no funds from this source have been available for use.
