It is to be attributed mainly to the supply of Home Grown meat avail-able at this period of the year.   There is no difficulty, however, in making deliveries keep pace with arrivals, and stocks have shown a steady reduction.FORWARD SALES,   No further forward salas have been made but a tonnage programme lias been framed by Messrs, Vestey Brothers, Limited, which provides for the whole of the New Zealand beef purchased by them being lifted by the end of February.TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS.   The last of the contracts, that with Queensland,&apos; terminated on 30th -November, and the next statement of the stock position will define the liability of the Ministry for meat to be lifted.TONNAGE.   The programme for shipments provides for all Ministry meat to be shipped by the middle of February, and even allowing for all the inevitable delays which arise in connection with shipping, it should all be afloat by the end of March.At the same time provision has been made for the shipment of free meat. In the case of New Zealand it commences with 10$ of the space in December, rising to 40% in-February, and in the case of Australia beginning with 53$ in December, rising to 50$ in January.   This is in addition to refrigerated space provided for Cheese and Butter, and is expected to be the minimum. Probably the actual allowance will exceed these figures, and it is possible that the whole of the March loading may be available for private shippers.DAMAGE IN AUSTRALASIAN STORES.   Sir Thomas Robinson is leaving for Australia and New Zealand early in December and has been given auth-ority to obtain settlement of the claims the Government has against certain Freezing Works in respect of meat which sustained damage while in the Works.(SGD) CHARLES A.
