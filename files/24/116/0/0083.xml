DOCUMENT IS THE PROTERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S 00V3RnAB6 ;ET,2283. C   ABIDE T\- .....&quot;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; &apos;-1   &apos;!&apos; f; /-MEMORANDUM ON AGRICULTURE BILL BY THE SECRETARY   FOR SCOTLAND.1* I have read with groat concern  the Memorandum(CP .2247) by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer on the agriculture Bill,2, I am vitally interested in the question he raises,as Scotland is largely an oats producing country.3, I desire to protest against the proposal at thisstage to alter the guaranteed prices in the Agriculture Bill,     It is true that the proposed guaranteed price for oata is  higher in proportion to wheat than the price in the Corn Production Act.4* But it must be remembered that the price in theBill is based on definite evidence placed before the Royal Commission..&apos;    To alter the price because it is not in proper relation to wheat is to ignore the facts of costs of production^ fcpon which the prices in the Bill are fixed,5. To fix without said   evidence an arbitrary figureat this stage would be regarded aw3 a breach of faithu Apart from Its political effect, it would have the worst possible effect on british farming.     I earnestly trust that the Jiill will remain unaltered.(SGD)     ROBERT MUNRO,Scottish Office, Whitehall, S,W*13th December, 1920,
