Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.The Debate in the House of Lords on the Irish Bill.I share to.the full the congratulations to Lord Gurzon on his personal success in the House of Lords, recorded in the Cabinet Minutes of last Friday&apos;s meeting.   But I desire to put on record one difficulty that i feel.In a previous memorandum on the Irish question, .1. said that I had great difficulty in agreeing with&apos; the view put forward by the Government in the House of Commons when a motion for giving to the Irish Parliaments a fiscal, autonomy was rejected on the invitation of the Government. I understood, and understand, that the views of the Government were, and are, that concession or amendment of this kind is only feasible if we are thereby to procure peace, and it is no use giving away everything you have to give unless there is somebody ready to accept it and to promise you the peace that you seek. Although 1 must, confess to a leaning towards Lord Grey&apos;s argument in the opposite direction, this argument is intelligible and reasonable. It is the argument repeated incautious language by the Lord Chancellor on the 23rd November&quot; Nobody is really so unreasonable as to suppose that we should put forward in our Dili financial proposals in the face of wdiich we see a very great financial difficulty. Equally, I hope, no one is so thoughtless as to imagine that if pence were offered to us by any body which was plainly qualified to speak for Irish opinion we should not examine and re-examine the whole field with the object of discovering any way of satisfying those with whom it is our primary and paramount object to deal.&quot;I have never been, able to convince myself that there was any &quot; insuperable financial difficulty,&quot; and .1 have always hoped that it was along these lines that peace would ultimately be obtained.I am, therefore, much dismayed to find in Lord Curzons speech on the 25th November a statement that fiscal autonomy for the two Irish Parliaments is &quot; altogether unthinkable,&quot; and later on there is a statement which amounts in effect to this, that customs, excise and income tax could only be given to a united Ireland with a single Parliament. That, of course, is the Bill as it is now, but it seems to me that to stand in all circum-stances to this, is out of harmony with what I understood was the view of the Government, and out of harmony with what the Lord Chancellor stated.E. S. M.29th November 1920.2838-2100+100  12.20
