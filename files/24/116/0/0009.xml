Circttlate4-^y-4he,Secretary of State for India.r3The Turkish Peace. - -*/I have circulated to the Cabinet two telegrams from the Viceroy, yIt seems to me fair that, so far as India is concerned, and Afghanistan, and, I think, Asia generally,,the most important modification of the Treaty which could be suggested would be to admit the nominal suzerainty of the Kaliph over the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, and, query, Jerusalem.I think, at any rate, that the Allies should state that they would offer no opposition to the restoration of this nominal suzerainty if arranged between the Turks and the Sheriff of Mecca. The fact remains that as time goes on, King Hussein has shown himself incapable of maintaining the dignity of the custodianship of the Holy Places without the authority of the Kaliph, from whom he used to derive his authority, and that the arrangements for the pilgrimage were so bad as to have still further estranged India from his claims.Of course, this modification would not in itself cure the situation.Smyrna and a proper frontier for Armenia agreed between Armenia andthe Turks, are all-important.   It does seem to me worthy of consideration as to whether we should not take the opportunity that has presented itselfto obtain peace in the East and a large reduction of expenditure by some means such as these, ,.-, E.
