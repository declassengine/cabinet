SECRET.:Circulated by tfre^pecretary. of State for India.......liSH    0.P,  2Telegram from Viceroy, Education Department, to Secretary of Slate for India,dated 2nd December 1920.Students&apos; non-co-operation. Please see our telegram oi&apos; the 20th ultimo. Aligarh. In accord with expressed wishes of leading Moslems and proposal of Local Government, we have brought University Act into operation, with effect from 1st December, with Raja of Mahmndabad as Vice-Chancellor.Benares. -Though we have no official report, it is clear from Press telegrams that intensive campaign against University has failed. Gandhi appears temporarily to have abandoned attempt.Lahore. After outbreak indicated in last telegram, which was engineered by Kichlen, with help of Bazaar roughs and resulted in some violence, situation has improved, and large number of students are organising themselves as anti-non-co-operatists.Amritsar. Khalsa College reopened on 22nd November with small attendance, some professors handing in resignations.Madras. Nothing to report save news given in Press telegrams of meetings intended to spread disaffection among students, and disorderly behaviour of students during polling for Couucils.Bengal. Official report states College of Madrassah reopened on 6th November, and working since then without interruption. Insignificant (number of ?) boys left Anglo-Persian Department, but substantial number have left Arabic Department, and attendance there is below normal. Impertinent attempt made to open National School for Anglo-Persian department of pupils, but Arabic department of pupils are offered instruction in National Madrassah, at Zachariah Mosque, and scholarships, This National Madrassah (? is) attracting no additional students and no instruction given. No further trouble in Calcutta schools or colleges. Attempt being made by agitators to stir up trouble in Chittagong, with result that majority of students of Government Moslem High School are (? absent) and smaller number in Madrassah. Attendance also fell off at Chittagong College, but is now improving and no further trouble anticipated. Inspector of schools, Dacca, reports that National Madrassah started there with 40 boys who, it is alleged, will be sent about to spread non-co-operation. Local Governments consider position, on the whole, is mending and generally satisfactory, though further pressure from outside may have bad effect, especially in view of excitable nature of Bengal students. ,General. No other matters to report save meetings of agitators organised for students, and opening of some national institutions, such as the so-called National University at Surat, opened by Gandhi. These institutions appear to be schools for propagandism rather than instruction. But, where instruction is given, it appears largely to follow lines of Government schools and University curricula, a peculiarity which was observed in movement for national education in Bengal in 1.907, and is significant of anticipated ephemeral nature of effort.2S74     100  12.20
