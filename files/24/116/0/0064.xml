THIS P0OM5HT IS THIS PKOPKRIY OP HIS BBITAMIO MAJESTY&apos;S OOVERJIMM?.CABIflEg. 3Proposed jmendment of Fair ffagea Resolution. flote by Minister of labour *RET7*^*264. 2)he objection to the proposed amendment of the FairV/ages Resolution raised by the Army Council in their memorandum to the Cabinet dated 85th November (doPa 168) re-states the arguments advanced when, after repeated representations from the parliamentary Committee., of the Trades Union Congress, the original proposal was made by the Minister of labour in 1918*    At that time, the proposal was referred to the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet who &quot;generally agreed that, while the proposal of the Ministry of labour was in itself desirable, nothing ought to be done at present which might tend to send up the cost of Government Contracts,    Ihe Minister of Labour undertook to consider the matter further in the light of the discussion which had taken place, and to rai3e the matter again*!TSince the proposal was first made in 1918, there has been a material alteration of oiroumstanoes and tho representatives of the Contracting Departments on the pair T.wages Advisory Oommittee, inoluding the representative of the Department then responsible for Army Contraot business, unanimously agreed at a meeting in January last that they oould no longer.substantiate their former objection.During the war period, the military requirements of the Government were suoh that Contracting Departments were eager to augment the number of firms capable Of supplying their needs; at the present time, and especially with the/recent
recent falling off in trade, the position is altered and firms are now seeking Government contracts.    i\irther, Trade Union organisation has advanced enormously during recent years and the view of the Ministry of Labour is that firms of any standing at all would, In fact, pay &quot;fair&quot; rates on their civil as well as on their Government contracts*    iProm the financial point of view, therefore% the effect of the amendment would he negligible.    On tha other hand it is olearly in accord with the spirit of the tfair Wages Resolution, that a firm should be a &quot;fair&quot; firm throughout, The war Office Memorandum appears to the ministry of Labour to exaggerate the offoot which the adoption of the proposed amendment would have upon the Contracting Departments.    The proposed amendment in effect does littlo more than extond; to all the Contracting Departments a policy which acme Departments have already adopted without giving rise to any administrative difficulty.The Departments are not called upon themselves to take the initiativo to a greater extent than at present in securing that firms pay &quot;fair&quot; rates upon their private work. The amendment merely provides that the Departments shall exclude from the list of private contractors, firms Yho &quot;have been shown to the satisfaction of the Departments concerned&quot; not to observe the principles of the Kesolution.With regard to paragraph 6 of lord kilne^s memorandum the advantage of the word &quot;principles&quot; in the proposed amendment is that that term leaves to the Government Departments concerned as much latitude as ie possible consistently with the object of the ^amendment.    Tho term &quot;obligation&quot; (the word which is used in the present j*&apos;air Wages Resolution) cannot vory well be used in regard to the private work since there can be no obligations except under cpecifio contracts./The
The question raised at the end of Lord kiln ex&apos;s memorandum as to whether awards made by tho committee on production and wages fixed by Orders made by the Ministry of Munitions would automatically bo made payable upon the private work as well as upon Government work, has now loot its point, The Wages (Temporary Kegulation) Act passed in November, 1910., with the eonourxence both of the employers&apos; organisations and of the irade Unions, praotioally placed this requirement on employers, and from the faot that organised employers and workpeople oonourred In the extension of the prinoiple of tho lot till September 20th, 1920, it is clear that the requirement did   not have the adverse results anticipated by tho V/ar Office.With regard to the War Office request for a special Committee to examine the proposal, I would remind my colleagues that the question has already received the most careful consideration of the **air r/ages advisory committee and that it was also considered at a conference of ministers on 4th November..    If, notwithstanding these discussions, the War Office desire to prens their request for yet a further discussion, I see no objection to that course.s Jlnitd.) I.J.1A.7th Deoember, 1920.
