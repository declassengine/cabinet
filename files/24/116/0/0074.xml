[Tliis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1920.CONFIDENTIAL. C.P.-2274.CABINET.General.RESOLUTIONS ON ECONOMY.(As announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer during the debate on National Expenditure, on Thursday, December 9, 1920.)(Reference Hansard, vol. 135, No. 156 columns 2506-2509.)IN pursuance of the policy of reducing national expenditure the Cabinet are acting upon the following principles in preparing the Budget for the financial year 1921-22 : 1. Whilst recognising that there are many reforms that are in themselves desirable in order to improve conditions in the United Kingdom, the Cabinet, having regard to the exceptionally heavy taxation which is the inevitable consequence of the war, the high oost of material, ihe trade reaction that has set in and the emergency measures required to mitigate, the hardships of unemployment, consider that to the extent that such reforms involve further burdens upon the Exchequer or the rates the time is not opportune for initiating them or putting them into operation. It is an instruction, therefore, to all spending Departments that, except with fresh Cabinet authority, schemes involving expenditure not yet in operation are to remain in abeyance. This general principle applies to all spending Departments, but exception must be made for such temporary measures as are necessary for dealing with the special problem of the unemployed.The sums which can be saved by the above means would not, in the aggregate, amount to a very substantial figure, even if all these reforms were completely arrested, and the only method of effecting savings on a considerable scale is in the war departments.2. The Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Shipping-will be wound up this financial year and any outstanding functions will be discharged by other Alinisters in other Departments. Legislation may be required for the purpose.The liquidation of the Food Ministry has already made great progressThe Ministry Estimates, which twelve months ago were  2,500,000 and six months ago were  1,500,000, are now reduced to  750,000. By the end of this month the Live Stock Organisation and the Regional Organisation will both have been wound up.Four-fifths of our commitments in respect of imported meat have been liquidated successfully without disturbance of trade.It is doubtful whether it will be possible to complete the decontrol of both sugar and wheat within the financial year, but the Ministry of Food, as a separate Government Department, will cease to exist at the close of the year, and such powers as may still be found necessary will be transferred to another Department in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of Food Continuance Act.3. The Cabinet are convinced of the necessity of curtailing military expenditure to the utmost extent compatible with the fulfilment of our Imperial obligations and national safety. The principal field for economy is in the Near and Middle East, and theWinding up of certain Depart-inents created during the War.Military Expendi-ture.
2position in these regions is being fully explored with a view to further and drastic reductions of expenditure the moment the situation permits.The Government of Persia has already been notified of our intention to withdraw the last of the British forces from that country in the coming spring. The force in Palestine is already in course of reduction.In Mesopotamia, the aim of the British Government has always been to develop the resources of this region, to set up an Arab Government and to replace the Imperial forces by an Arab army In accordance with this policy the forces there had already been reduced from 222,000 men, at the time of the armistice, to 79,000 men by June, 1920, and were in process of further rapid reduction, when the outbreak of a serious rebellion not indigenous, hut fomented from outside Mesopotamia, necessitated their reinforce-ment. Even if the Government had decided to withdraw from Mesopotamia and leave the country to its fate it is by no means certain that this course was possible as a military operation, certainly it was not possible without heavy losses in life and stores. There was therefore no choice but to reinforce the garrison and to suppress the rebellion. This task has been almost accomplished. Simultaneously with the suppression of the remnants of the rebellion, Sir Percy Cox, the High Commis-sioner, is actively engaged in the creation of an Arab State, and the Provisional Government is pressing forward the creation of an Arab army, which will provide a substitute for the British forces. We hope that within a reasonable time an Arab Government will have taken over the administration and defence, the Imperial forces will have been reduced to a small nucleus garrison, and Mesopotamia, a country with great potential resources, will be self-supporting.Naval Expenditure. 4. While determined to maintain the Navy at a standard of strength which shall adequately secure the safety of the Empire and its maritime communications, the Cabinet, before sanctioning a programme of new construction, are bound to satisfy themselves that the lessous of the war have been definitely ascertained, more particularly as regards the place and usefulness of the capital ship in future naval operations.They have, therefore, decided-and the Admiralty -welcome the decision that the Committee of Imperial Defence shall institute at once an exhaustive investigation into the whole question of naval strength as affected by the latest developments of naval warfare. They will present no programme for capital ship construction to Parliament until the results of this enquiry have been considered.Air Expenditure. 5. The utmost economy will be enforced in the administrationof the air programme, and the position and functions of the Royal Air Force will be examined in relation to the Navy and Army.*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., December 10, 1920.o* As a result of a discussion between the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Sea Lord, the lerms of the resolutions as approved provisionally by the Cabinet on the 8th December were subsequently modified to read as set forth above.
