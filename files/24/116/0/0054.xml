(Home Office)Special Report ITo. 20.Scotland House, S.W.1.7th December, 1920,(Circulated by the Home Secretary)TK3 CO-OHiKATIVE HOVBMSNIThe oo-operative movement comprised, until reoent years, two distinct divisions, industrial and agricultural, each with its own organisation.    The former may besub-divided into associations of producers and associations of consumers; of the last named there are three groups; retail distributive societies, national federations of wholesale. Society Ltd., and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.) and smaller local organisations carrying on suoh business as laundering and baking.    A further overlapping of members and societies has resulted from the formation, in more recent years, of Co-operative Guilds, the Co-operative Party, the Co-operative Union Limited, the Co-opea&amp;tive Productive federation Limited, the Co-operative Insurance society Limited, the Co-operative Wholesale Society Health Insurance Seotion, and theAmalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Smployees and Allied Workers.The agricultural seotion of the Co-operative movement, which does not come within the scope of this paper, isknown as the Agricultural Organisation Sooiety Limited.The/retail distributive sooieties (e.g. the Co-operative
The Irish organisation is stronger than the English and Soottish.groups, and in 1918, numbered among its 938 affiliated societies 350 creameries, with a turnover of over  5,000,000.The Industrial Co-operative Societies may be dividedinto:, Distributive -Societies production&apos;jive SocietiesEnglish Wholesale Society (Productive endDistributive) Scottish      M H &quot;Irish &quot; &quot; &quot;RSTAIL INDUSTH1&amp;L CO-OPSii&amp;TlVlB 3QCIJTISS,f The retail co-operative movement, in its modern form, may be said to date from the establishment of the iioohdale : Honears&apos; Society in 1844, on which model all subsequent societies have been based. The primary object of a retai co-operative Bociety is distribution and it aims at saving for the members shopkeepers&apos; and, if possible, the wholesalers&apos; profits. There is no limit to membership; each person wishing to join must take up at least one  1 share, paying, if he choose, 1/- on entrance and the remainder out of his accumulating-dividends. The maximua share of capital which one person may hold is  200. Goo( are sold at the ordinary retail prices, each purchaser receiving vouchers corresponding to the amount paid; half yearly or quarterly these vouchers are returned to the store and the surplus of receipts over cost is divided am the members at the rate of So much per  1; this is the re or as it is generally called, the dividend. Saeh store is managed by a committee elected by the members, one mem having one vote.    The distributive societies in some oas9carry on productive departments, such as baking, oom-mill, cabinet making, bootmaking, tailoring and dress-making.At,
At the end of 1948 j there were in the United Kingdom, excluding agricultural societies end credit b&amp;nlis, 1468 retail co-operative societies, with an&apos;aggregate membership of 3,392,221; a total trade, distributive and productive, of  293.109,430, end a total share, loan, and reserve capital of  93,190.411.&apos;   the employees of the societies numbered at this date 158,751.The majority of oo-operatora are ooncerned, as co-operators,, almost exclusively with their dividends and pay little attention to other aspects of th3ir society.    This apathy, as in the case of the Trades Union Movement, has enabled the extremists in some instances to seise control of the machinery.    U&amp;s best example of minority influence occurred in August, 1920, at Nottingham, .where there are about 18,000 oo-operators.    At the request of any 50 members a special members&apos; meeting can be convened and this number of socialists accordingly summoned a meeting to discuss affiliation with the Labour movement.     Tho meeting was announced by means ot notices posted in the local co-operative stores and 70 members attended, including the 50 conveners. A resolution was passed and the 18,000 members of the Nottingham Co-operative Society are now pledged to support the fusion of the Labour and Co-operative movements.&quot;Hie co-operative societies were responsible for supplying the needs of many of the moulders   in their prolonged stride of 1919 and it was reported that the Co-operative VJb.olesa.le Society Bank placed  100,000 at the disposal of the National Union of i&amp;ilwaymen during the railway strike of the isame year.    A. London Joint Advisory Council of Co-operators and trade unionists was formed and on September 30th passed thefollowing/
following resolution:-&quot;That in view of the present industrial crisis created by the railway dispute, and the probable extension of the dispute to other seotions of industry, the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators are of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken to operate Clause 5 oontained in the statement of objeots issued as a baBis of joint action between the trades union and oo-operative movements by the National Advisory Counoil of Trades Unionists and Co-operators,&quot;We are strongly of opinion that the National Advisory Counoil should take action immediately and prepare to meet present and future emergencies by making, if possible, the following arrangements:-1.      To secure an immediate national agreement with the trade unions representing the workers engaged in the production and distribution of food, making provision for a continuation of Co-operative employment and the utilisation of the co-operative movement as the food distributive agency to members of txude unions and oo-operative societies.2,     To make provision for the setting up of trade union and co-operative emergenoy committees to act jointly in giving effect to the above proposal.&quot;Clause 5 reatfe as followsj-&quot;The consideration of how far it is desirable and possible to ensure the unrestricted distribution of food supplies, or the payment of benefit during the important trade disputes by issuing through the various branches of the co-operative movement, food coupons or loans from the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s bank on the security of Trade Union assets.&quot;The principles underlying this resolution have since undergone considerable looal ramifidation.    The South WalesMiners&apos; Federation, for instance, has invested  175,711. 19. 2. or muoh more than one third of its total oapital in theCo-operative Viholesaie Society Bank and plans for the distribution of food to strikers have been drawn up.    National arrangements are also said to have been made by the Miners&apos; Federation cf Great Britain and by the Soottish county unions.Efforts to promote mutual assistance received further stimulus vhen the local councils of action were formed in Augus and the succeeding months.    The most definite example was reported from London, where it was stated, at a secret meeting,by/
by the president, that the General Committee of the StratfordCo-operative Sooiety was prepared to plaoe the whole resourcesof the Society at the disposal of the local councils of aotion,immediately a general strike occurred.&quot;There has of late been a tendenoy towards the amalgamation of retail societies; the most important is that of Edmonton*(25,000 members) and Stratford (50,000 members); this body is well to the Left, politically.    Ike ten societies in and around London have a membership of 230,000. . .THS CO-OJFSflATIV^ WH0LS3AL3 SOCIflTY LIMITS1;. Balloon St., Manchester..

tilUntil 1920 the Cooperative Wholesale Society pursued a strictly business policy, and a majority of directors would still prefer to follow that line.    The various efforts made since the conclusion of the war to increase the capital of the Society, including the issue of -&quot;Development Bonds&quot; and the activities of the financial Propaganda Department and the Publicity Department, may be considered- frae from political bias.    Tne Oo-operative Wholesale. Society Limited is at present making great efforts to increase its capital; at the beginning of 1920, &quot;Development Bonds&quot; were issued to the value of  5,000,000, in denominations .of  20 -  1,000, open to the public and to societies.    By November only  3,000,000 had been taken up and during the eecond half of that month a series of meetings were held, at the instigation of the Co-operative Wholesale Society financial Propaganda Committee to induce trade unionists to invest in the Co-operative Wholesale Bank, in preference to the Post Office Savings Bank.Co-operators are for one most part, drawn from the ranks of manual labourers or lower middle olass, and attempts to bring about at least mutual support between the Co-operative and Labour movements were therefore inevitable sooner or later.   1913-1914, ;the period of the Dublin strike, marked the first steps, when the Co-operative V/wholesale Society delivered to the Irish capital the1supplies of food ordered in Manchester by the Parliamentary Committee of the&apos; Trade Union Congress to save the strike from collapse.   In I9I2, however, the Chairiaan of the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society had already proposed the formation 0,: a joint Co-operative and Labour Board, consisting of the Co-operative Union, Trades Union Congress, the Wholesale Societies and the Labour tarty.   The Board was to further the investment :.  tWm&amp; &apos; U IS&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos; T Mim&apos; &apos;   &apos;   \ Still II . Wi

In so far as they affect the Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety it is sufficient to ohroniole the resolution placed on the agenda of the eight divisional meetings of the Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety in Ootober 1920 by 52 retail societies; this is known as the &quot;Stratford resolution&quot;, and the text is as follows:&quot;This meeting instructs the Oo-operative Wholesale Society directors to consult with the National Committee of the co-operative party as to the best way in which the Co-operative   wholesale Society . can render assistance to secure the practical Japplication of the policy of the Co-operative party as laid down by Congress, and present their report and proposals to the quarterly meetings in January 1920.&quot;The total voting on this resolution was 1,209 forand/i&apos;,;S0,of Trade Union oapital in co-operative enterprise, to secure co-operative assistance in industrial disputes and topromote common propaganda and educational work.    The Annual Co-operative Congress in 1913, however, condemned this proposal, on the grounds that it impaired the political neutrality of the Co-operative movement.   The Dublin congress in 1914 resulted in the following interesting v,oting on thethree resolutions:1.    Favouring a Joint Co-operative and Labour Board, 2,    Approving a Board minus the Labour- Party. 3.    Kegativing the entire question.Summary of Voting

The various affiliated societies pay an annual subscription to the Union and the income is augmented by-the&apos; sale of literature.Although the Union is responsible; for most of the co-operative activities in the direction of education and propaganda the centre of its existence may be said to be the annual Congress.    For the purpose of this paper the last four Congresses only *tre of importance.    At the Swansea conference in 1917 it was decided, in the&apos; terms of the&apos;. - 1 following/
to/following resolution, to form &amp; co-operative party:&quot;That this National Conference of Co-operators of the United Kingdom desires to mark the entrance of the Co-op era tive Movement into the political arena with a definite expression of it:- general policy of industrial, social, ;nd eoonomic reform, and hereby declares its adherence to the following aims:-&quot;(1)   To safeguard effectually the interests of voluntary co-operation, and to resist any legislative or administrative inequality which would hamper its progress,&quot;(2)   That eventually the processes of production, distribution, and exchange (including the land) shall be organised on co-operative lines in the interests of the whole community&quot;(3)   Skat the profiteering ox private speculators anci the trading community generally shall be eliminated by legislative or administrative action.&quot;(4)   The scientific development of agriculture, and the provision of light railways for transport of produce, together with adequate housing ano wages for the agricultural labourer.&quot;(5)   The abolition of all taxes upon foodstuffs to be replaced by the taxation of land values and the further increase of income tax and death duties upon large incomes and estates.M(6)   That in order to facilitate the development of trade, commerce, and manufacture after the war, the Government shall establish a National Credit Bank to assist local authorities, Co-operative Societies, ano others to finance their new undertakings as required.&quot;(7)   That adequate housing of the people, financed by the National Exchequer, shall be coiapulsorily provided on lines which will seouie healthy, decent, and suitable accommodation for the whole community.&quot;(8)   That the present education system should be recast on national lines which will afford equal opportunity of the highest education to all, unhampered by the oaste system now prevailing, whioh arbitrarily and unjustly liaits the resources of the State in utilising the best capacities of the nation.&quot;(9)   The effective Parliamentary control of foreign policy and national services by Co-amittees composed of representatives of all parties in the House of Commons.&quot;(10) The gradual demobilisation of the soldiers and sailors from our Army and Navy to correspond with the needs of industry in order to avoid unemployment.&quot;(11)   The breaking down of the caste and class systems, and the democratising of State services -civil, commercial and diplomatic.&quot;In the following year, at Liverpool, it was decided
to secure direct representation in Parliament and on looal Government bodies.  Last year the Carlisle Congress went further and instructed its ^presentation Committee to take steps to federate with the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, with the ultimate object of forming a United Democratic or People&apos;s Party.kt the Bristol Congress this year a resolution was moved recommending the establishment of a definite Labour and co-operative Politioal Alliance, but the leaders contrived to avoid the direct issue of federation with the Labour Party ana the Trades Union Congress.    The president rulec the resolution out of order, as the plans had not been discussed by the district conferences in accordance with the decision of the Carlisle Congress.    The suggested Alliance woulc; have taken the form of a Joint Committee of 9 members, 3 being appointed respectively by the Co-operative Union, the Labour Party and the Perliamentary - Committee of the Trades Union Congress. . This matter will come up for decision at the annual Congress in 1921.
