It is probable that the Liverpool fires were part of the plans for destroying Liverpool Docks; considerable damage was done, one man was shot and several arrests were ixvde in Liverpool, but the difficulty is that while in most oases there is a certainty that the arrested men are implicated, there is not sufficient evidence to convince a Court. As in the war, internment appears to be the only solution.There was one unsuccessful attempt to bum a warehouse in London, and a seizure of time fuses probably connected with this attempt has been made at Brirbon.   An explosion that took place is believed not to have been due to Sinn Fein.Public opinion in all classes is very strong against Sinn Fein.Unemployment is very acute and tsere are rumours of another march of ex-soldiers to Downing Street to demand work.   Agitators continue to incite the unemployed to robbery and&apos; seizure of the means of production.   At Hackney last night there waB a flracas between the Police and ex-soldiers who had seized an empty house; Peckham Public Library, Walthamstow Baths and Edmonton Town Hall have also been seized by the unemployed.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is conducting a most mischievous campaign against the employers, who are alleged to have joined forces for an all-round reduction of wages; Communist orators are preaching the same thing, as if there were a common understanding with the paper.The strike of wood-workers in the shipbuilding industry began yesterday.A/
A Conference of Communist Parties.is to be held on instructions from Moscow at Manchester, probably on December 11th.Ivjr,. Robert Williams has gone to Germany as delegate of the Communist Parcy -of Creat Britain.   He will there be joined by J- T. Lfurphy, who l-as be oh abroad since the beginning of the year.
TH5 OGMMUMISTSAs a result of an informal meeting in London at which instructions from Moscow were considered, the various Communist Parties have decided to hold a National Conference in Manchester, probably cn December 11th. Invitations have gone out to the Communist Party of Great Britain, the Communist Labour party, the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International), the Socialist Labour Party, the National Shop Stewards&apos; Committee and the Soottish Workers&apos; Committee.     In a oircular letter it is stated that &quot;for reasons which are laiown, the Chairman appointed by the Moscow Executive is unable to enter this country&quot;.     It is clear that this refers to Theodore Rothstein.Groat efforts are boing made by the Communist Party to carry out the orders from Mosco?/ for feer, no doubt, that disobedience would entail financial disaster.     In &quot;The Communist&quot; there is an article entitled &quot;Thoughts cn Unity&quot;, and the writer regards &quot;unity&quot; as acceptance of the Third International programme.     The writer1s text is that &quot;Discipline is the key to victory1 and he appeals to all sections to sacrifice their self-love and obey the instructions of the International&quot;.The Communist Party of Great Britain is urging the formation of &quot;groups&quot; within local branches, no doubt with a view to greater efficiency in the event of an industrial upheaval.   This &quot;emergency system for communist action&quot; consists ef groups of ten communists, with a group leader, duly entered in the group register; the group leaders will be responsible to the local :   secretary, who will thus be able to affect &quot;mobilisation&quot;. &quot;The machine can be kept up to scratch by practice ralliesor/
or falso alarms.&quot;    Members of the executive and branch officials will form a group of their own.There is much dissension in Sylvia Pankhursfs Communist Party of which the income from home sources is stated to be, on an average, not more than  7 per week. For the week ending October 9th only five branches sent remittances, totalling  3.10.4d. and the secretary received only  3.14.2d. on account of his salary of  5.     The negro Claude McKay wished to take Sylvia PankhursVs place as editor of the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&apos;&apos; but this was   , considered too dangerous.   He has since been dismissed as Sylvia Pankhurst considered that he was to blame for putting the naval article in the paper.    He intends shortly to leave the country.    Watkins, the Welsh miner, who is also treasurer of the party, then wanted to take control of the Agenda Press and of the paper.Miss Gilbertson, who has been accused of causing the arrest of Veltheim by having sent him a letter, is in turn accusing several of her &quot;comrades&quot; of having spoken indiscreetly of him.    Meanwhile the&apos; Communist Party of Great Britain wishes to absorb the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; in &quot;The Communist&quot;.It is said that Maiden lane has received some Russian money intended for Sylvia Pankhurst and that the expenses incurred at the Albert Hall meeting were defrayed from this.Sylvia Pankhurst, when in Moscow, protested against the amount of money given to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; but was told to attend to her own affairs, as the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; though not communist was obviously &quot;a danger to,the Government&quot;.    She is1 now working on propaganda in a room at the top of the $oy Factory and is believed to receive communications from abroad by courier only.An/
An embrpanio Red Army is believed to be in existence in London; Tanner and Hease are two of the moving spirits but the organisation is not, as yet, dangerous.The seventh annual conference of the London Labour Party has reaffirmed its decision not to accept the affiliation of local communist parties.On November 88th, the Communist Labour Party held a meeting of some 400 people in the Sooialist Hall, Glasgow, leckie, who was the chief speaker, worked himself up   into such a passion that he discarded his jacket, tie and collar, in order to denounce the Government with greater freedom. He said that the working classes should openly declare war on the capitalists; the workers must combine into one solid organisation, prooure arms and proper leaders and proceed to gain control by forcible action.    The only salvation of Ireland v/as a revolution in this country; that revolution must be accomplished very shortly.    The Government would do to the people of Scotland what they had done to the people of Ireland; he was aware that numbers of &quot;Black and Tans&quot; came from Glasgow, he therefore asked that their home addresses should be obtained and sent to Sinn Fein headquarters, in order that suitable measures might be adopted.INTSRNATIONAL CONFftKINCSSThe International Federation of Trade Unions jnet in Congress in London from November 22nd - 27th.    Some 100 delegates represented approximately 26,000,000 organised workers and 18 nationalities.    Following the resignation of Mr. Appleton, Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P., was elected president. The withdrawal of the -American federation of Labour was due to the faot that it has always stood for the limitation of the work of the Federation to purely industrial matters.    Russia was not represented but sent an open letter signed by Zinovieff, Lenin, Bukharin, Radek, Quelch, Bela Kun,Rudniansky/
Rudniansky and others, for the Third&apos; International; andTomsky, Losovsky, Rosmer, Milkitch, and Shablin for theInternational Federation of Trade and Industrial Unions.This document is typical of most Moscow messages and contaiilluminating passages:&quot;CITI2EH3:   You call your Congress the International Congress of Trade Unions.     In reality it is a congress of yellow leaders who continually betray the fundamental interests of the Labour movement in general, and of the trade unions in particular.&quot;You will exclaim that by this letter we insult tens of millions of organised workers.    You can shout as much as you like.    -We do not even think of insulting the organised workers.     It is not the fault of the workers, but their misfortune, that you, the yellow leaders, can still speak on behalf of Labour organisations.&quot;We know well that among the millions of workers whom you Represent1 there are many honest and conscious workers who, however, are not sufficiently-organised to be able to turn   you out. You may rest  assured that the moment for that will soon arrive.&quot;You have somewhat altered your methods of betraying the workers at the end of the slaughter, but betrayal remains, as heretofore, your main profession.     You have helped the bandit League of fiations to found a &quot;Labour1 Bureau, at the head of which there is such an experienced scoundrel as the &quot;Socialist1, Albert Thomas, who attempts to hoodwink the workers of all countries, making them believe that the bourgeoisie is caring about the protection of Labour.    At heart every one of you knows well that the International Labour Bureau is a capitalist organisation - only a red herring on the path of the international working class.&quot;You declare war upon the Communist International and war you shall have.     In this fight the workers have nothing to lose except deadweight - you ...&quot;Many of you gentlemen once belonged to the workers.   Many of you received your education on meagre pennies earned by hard work.   Many of you have come up from our midst.   Many of you were trusted by the workers until now.&quot;You now collect around yourselves a handful of the Labour aristocracy and place it at the service of capital.   The best that the worker possesses, his knowledge of life, his energy, and perseverance, you are placing at the disposal of capital.   You know well the strong ana weak points of the working class and avail yourselves of it in order to save the capitalists in a difficult moment.   You have     ^ become !gentlemen&apos;.   Two fingers stretched out to you
by a king of tho Stock Sxohange is dearer and pleasariter. to you than the confidence of the working class.&quot;The Congress discussed,at length the situation of Labour in the various countries represented and a resolution moved by Edo Fimmen, the secretary of the Federation, was passed by 21,906,000 to 2,710,000 votes on November 23rd, protesting against all open and covert attempts df the dominant olass to suppress the freedom of the workers, against military and commercial war against Russia, and celling on the International to fight the world reaction which threatens the life of the Trade Union movement.   It declared that above all things Militarism must be oombated in every form, and called upon the Trade Unionists of all countries to resort to the general strike and to international boycott as a stern and effectual weapon in the fight against reaction.On November 24th the Congress resolved itself into five commissions, which were to sit privately and consider resolutions on pacifism, the eight-hour day, socialisation of the means; of production, the exchange problem and the reply to be made to the Moscow International.   With regard to raw material, it was resolved that a just and fair distribution was essential to economic restoration. Monsieur Jouhaux moved a resolution, recommending repudiation pf international war debts,, and Oudegeest, of Holland, moveid that an increase of production could only be secured by the socialisation of land and other means of production.   The open letter from Moscow produced a feeling of resentment, but the reply contained an assurance of sympathy with the sufferings end revolutionary efforts* * 1 - - &quot; ,*-    1     &apos;.....-&apos;-- -&quot; I;.....- &apos; *r &apos;   &apos;&apos;v *of the Russian people, whcm(it invited to join this International.The/
The voting on this resolution was;For 22,122,000igainst 150,000Neutral       2,300,000Norway voted against and Italy remained neutral.The firsi international conference of railwaymen met at the Memorial Hall on November 29th.   The National Union of Railwaymen was represented by itB entire Execute Committee except Mr. Cramp and the agenda contained resolutions dealing with the eight hours day, moved by the French railwaymen; standardisation of working conditions for all grades of railwaymen, moved by the Netherlands; safety devices and the internationalisation of railways.Thirty-five delegates ere taking part in the conference and represent railway workers in Great Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark and Russia,Mr. J. H. Thomas apparently considered the occasion suitable for a blustering statement regarding the future policy of the National Union of Railwaymen, both in regard to management and hours; in relation to the latter, he is reported to have said:   &quot;We have obtained and will maintain the eight hours day, not at the will of the Government, but by the power and strength of our right hand.&quot;Yet another international labour conference of some interest took place at Milan on October 31st and three following days, that of the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International.    The Italian delegates were strongly in favour of affiliation with the Red Trade Union International, but the debate and the vote went heavily against this proposition.All these conferences have been hampered by languages! difficulties and in some cases six different translations of the same speech had to be made.RSVOLUTIONAEY/
i. 7 -REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING IN SOUTH WALESIt is reported that the Labour College classes in the South Wales coalfield are beginning to prove a drag upon the finances of the federation.    The students pay 1/ for each session but these fees do not defray the cost of the classes; those   run by:the Bhondda No.l. district last session resulted in a deficiency of  40, which has to be met from the district funds.    The saner miners are complaining in consequence and it has been decided to curtail printing.There is information to the effect that teachers in various parts of the Rhondda Valley, are giving their scholars impromptu revolutionary lectures.    Certain schools in the Tonypandy area seem to be centres of this propaganda;   the parents have difficulty in getting at the subjeot of these lectures, however, as the children are cowed by their instructors.W.G. Cove, of Ton Penire, a member of the executive o;f the National Union of Teachers, is mentioned as having given revolutionary TTtalksvV at Broullwyn Schools, Gelli, Ystrad Rhondda.    The Gelli Council Schools are also said to have been used for this purpose.THE. PROPOSED &quot;TRANSPORT AMD GENERAL WORKERS&apos; UNION&quot;The scheme to amalgamate all the trade unions connected with dock, waterside and road transport and various sections of general workers is probably the most ambitious yet entertained by British Labour.    The unions affected are:National Union of Dock, Riverside and&quot; General Vforkers in Great Britain and Ireland.Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union of Great Britain and Ireland.Scottish Union of Dock Labourers.Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen.Amalgamated Stevedores&apos; Labour Protection League.

The regulation of wages, hours of work, general conditions of employment; provision of strike, lookout, and victimisation pay; legal protection and other benefits; promotion and support of Parliamentary action through the Labour Party and labour representation on local authorities, etc.; educational work, publicity, etc.&quot;The suggested constitution is:(a) The General Sxecutive Council.

Sub-divisions in each group where desirable for trade purposes.The local organisation will take the form of area committees, trade committees.and branches and the British Isles will be divided into eleven geographical areas. .Officials holding posts in the existing unions will he either retained or compensated, according to their wiBhes.   All funds, assets and properties of the amalgamating unions will become the property of the new union and will be under the control of the General ExecutiveCouncil./

The proposed contributions for men are 6d. per week plus 6d. quarterage, in all  1. 8. 0. per annum end the pay suggested for strike, iock-out and victimisation benefit is  1 per week. The new union will be empowered to administer Part II of the National Insurance Act,The suggested strike and industrial policy is as follows:-The new Union shall, for the promotion of wage applications, working rules, etc, relegate the consideration and preparation of programmes, conduct of negotiations, etc, to the national trade and group committaBs, but the power to sanction strike action, authorise lock-out pay, and decide policy of the organisation shall be vested in the General Executive Council.Tho new Union shall undertake responsibility for and administration of all existing wage agreements and conditions, and shall honour same.This scheme, subject to certain amendments, is reportedto have been adopted yesterday at a conference where some500,000 workers were represented.M ECHO OF TBS &quot;HQ-EM?&quot; STHIgjOn November 25th the action brought against Smanuel Shinwell, the organiser of the &quot;No-rent strike&quot;, was concluded The Sheriff found that the house agent was entitled to have Shinwell ejected and granted a decree for his removal in a week,   Efforts are now being made to organise a defence force to prevent Shinwellrs ejectment, but there has hitherto been very little response from the unemployed,     Shinwell, who has to pay costs, is much perturbed by the turn of events. convictions on November 26th R. V. Harvey and J. Staele, who have been mentioned in these reports, were each sentenced to four months&apos; hard labour for acts calculated or,likely to causesedition/
sedition among the civilian population in Birmingham. SIM IE IN IN GREAT BRITAIN &apos;The week-end saw the beginning of what is apparently an attempt to carry out the Sinn Fein campaig of arson and murder in this country.   On the night of November 27th-28th, some 18 fires occurred in Liverpool and Bootle, within an area of four miles a^ong the docks 10 of these being in Liverpool; the buildings were warehouses and timber yards and the fires started almost simultaneously.   Hint ranee to the buildings was effected means of bolt-cutters and paraffin and petrol were used, The only victim of these outrages was a lad named Ward, who was shot dead after giving information to,.a policema:The National Irish Convention, which was to have been held in Manchester on November 27th,and the demonstration and procession arranged for the following day were proocribed by the local authorities, much to the satisfaction of the general public&quot;in Lancashire, who have been incensed by recent events in Ireland.   Arrange ments had been made by local ex-Service men to break up these meetings and there is little doubt that had they been allowed serious trouble and possible bloodshed would have resulted.   Dr. Mannix is, however, expected to address a very large meeting at Seaforth or Bootle on December 5th and local Sinn Feiners anticipate an enormous gathering.On November 26th the Executive Committee of the Irish Self-Determination League held a meeting in Manchester to consider their position and issued the following remarkable statement:&quot;We/
5 11 IwWe came to the conclusion .tjhat the 1 Manchester Blot1 was especially invented so1 as to give the Government an excuse to proclaim ,t,he Conference in Manchester, just &apos;as the famous&apos; plot was invented to produce the wholesale arrest.of Irishmen, including De Valera and Arthur Griffith in 1918 and that this was evidently the forerunner of the arrest of the leaders in Great britain and the Executive Committee will not submit to this unwarrantable interference with-freedom of speech and&apos;will proceed to hold its Conference and meetings.. &quot;:: - - -   (Signed)   P.J. KellySean Macoraith.&quot;An attempt to hold the convention at the Coal Exchange,Manchester, oh November  7th* was frustrated by the policeend the delegates met privately-at the Hibernian Hall,Salford, under the presidency of P. J. Kelly; some 300delegates were present.   There has been a great influx ofIrishmen to Manchester during the week-end.- Dr. Mannix addressed about 3,000 people at Blackburn on November 22nd, and about 4,000 at Rochdale on November 24th. A procession in the latter town was prohibited by the police. His speeches differed, little from that detailed in:my last report; he also addressed a mass meeting of about 1,000 Sinn Seiners atrWigan on -November&quot;g8tfi&apos;f&quot;&apos; in the same strain.... ,. .... ,v :/j      gottsm, ,Charles Diamond, editor of thf &quot;Catholic Her alii&quot;, and S.

Sheohy Skoffington addressed an audience of about 2,500 at Middlesbrough;&quot;she said that the Government had got together two or three plots worthy of the Cinema, plots about glanders in horses, the blowing up of Town Balls; plots that could only be produced by the brains of adipsomaniacf/
. dipsomaniac.   The Government had got together a Guy Fawkee plot of horrible dimensions, and Mr. Lloyd George and others were trembling behind the barrioados of Downing Street.Mrs. Annan Bryoe addressed a meeting of from 500-600 at Llwyny^ifi on November 28th but.said little of interest. Greenspon and Eanna are still active in the South Wales area.Sinn Fein activity in Glasgow appears to have been chiefly underground but it is reported that Thomas J. Murray, Commandant of &quot;3&quot; Company, Irish Volunteers, ma engaged in drilling South Side Companies in St. Francis1 Hall, Srrol Street, South Side, on November 27th.   Other offioers present included John Ryan and F. J. Duffy.   Bayonet practice and the usual military drill with wooden guns was indulged in for about 2 hours.IRELANDtThere was no material change in the state of the Provinces during the week.   In all 209 outrages were reported, this represanting an increase of 26 over the preceding week.   112 of these crimes were directly attributable to Sinn Fein, 7 were due to agrarian motives and 90 were miscellaneous out-rages with no apparent political object, but due to the state of lawlessness prevailing. :Threatening letters directed against the police are becoming rather prevalent in Ulster.   Information has been received that Sinn Fein intends to inaugurate a campaign of murder and outrage in Ulster with a view to making it appear that that Province is as bad as the rest of the country and if possible to draw off troops from other places in the south and west so that depleted forces may be attacked.Raids/
- 14 VRaids on the mails have become less frequent but there are -good grounds for believing that the /$ails are now being. jpilfered by sorters and others and-it- is impossible to \use-the post in Ireland for correspondence of any importance. I The lower ranks in the postal service are. quite untrustworthy. INo police barracks were attacked during, the period.   One   [ vacated barrack was burned, but other incendiary fires and cases of malicious injury due to, personal motives and revenge   I were rather numerous.:&apos;j IA considerable number of useful arrests, searches and seizures were effected during the. week and,, the Sinn Fein organisation in many parts of the, country is being cons id erablyB hampered. ;. . IThere are indications of a tendency to give information     j rather more freely, though the general population dare do nothinjl openly to assist the forces of the Crown and terrorism is still I rampant.   A brutal murder of an ex-soldier, wrongly suspected of giving information which led to :the,search of a house,   . occurred during the week in Westmeath..^     .    -;t [The Sinn. Fein papers of the week^ contain nothing of , I importance. , Ho, reference -is.* made-, to f ,th e;.murders of Sunday, 21st I November, but &quot;Old Ireland&quot; and &quot;Young Ireland&quot; both contain I lists of thirty persons alleged to have been murdered by the I Government forces during the week. This-is presumably intended I as a palliative for tho other dastardly murders which were,. \ almost certainly intended as resrivals.for.. the execution of. I Kevin Barry. , . 1Both papers are also uneasy at the reported intention of I the Government to publish the evidence of the German plot.
