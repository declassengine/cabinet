Property of &quot;9750/20125Central Control- Board (Liquor Traffic),134, Piccadilly, W. 1.223 1i - DEC 1020I am directed by tho Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) to refer to your letter of the 26th November and to say that the Board on.the same day issued an Order which gave immediate effect to the Cabinet1s wishes, fThe Board felt that in the circumstances they had no option;   but the incident has placed them in a position which emphasises and gives new point to the representations -which they have more than once made to the Government with regard tothe preservation of the principle of liquor control pending permanent legislation on the subject.   more than 18 months ago the Board urged that, as they were essentially a war emergency body, it was desirable that a transfer of powers to a new authority suitable to peace conditions should not be unduly delayed.    Again, early last Summer when the Board, in deference to a suggestion made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons, fixed for the period of Summer time the hours which they have now been requested to fix for winter time also, the Board urged on the Government the necessity for regularis-ing the situation in regard to liquor control.The present members of the Board, oannot but observe the agitation against licuor control in almost any shape */hich is now being organised both in and out of Parliament, and they feel bound to call the attention of the Government to the fact that in present circumstances they have not sufficient authority to deal properly with the situation,   not only are the existing uncertainties undermining the future ox liquor control generally, but they are also jeopardising the DirectQontrol/Ihe Secretary ofThe Cabinet,8, Whitehall Gardens,
Control-Undertakings at Garllsle and elsewhere, and unsettling the local administrations in those areas.It is further submitted with great respect, as the goneral feeling of the Board, that its members cannot con-tinue to act thereon if, in addition to the foregoing difficulties, thoy arc liable to bo called upon to exercise their powers so as to give effect to Cabinet decisions taken without previous consultation with the Board.The Board have recently forwarded to the Cabinet the Report of a Committee of the non-official members of their body on the question of Liquor Control, and they now feel it their duty to urge that the continued postponement of permanent legislation increases tho imperative necessity of securing from parliament an immediate understanding with regard to the nature and degree of tho control to be exorcised during the remainder of the interim period.I am, Sir,. Your obodient Servant, (Signed) J.C;Gr.Sykes. Secretary.
