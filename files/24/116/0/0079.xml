&quot;The Commission, therefore, decides to forward General&quot;Olive&apos;a letter to the Council of the league^ and to ask the&quot;Council, should it consider it possible to do *of to further&quot;the realisation of the projosal contained therein$*The following is the text of General Clivers letter:-. WI desin to bring the following matter, whioh touches &quot;our work in connection with Article 8 of the Covenant, tc the &quot;notice of the commissiont&quot;The task which has been given us by the Council if not one &quot;which affects our position as representatives of ovr respective wGovernments, in any case in its earlier stages.   Whether in &quot;seeking 4 &quot;basis on jhith some future reduction ef armaments &quot;may be grounded, or in devising a questionnaire $hieh will &quot;enable the council to compare existing armaments, we are &quot;engaged on a theoretical task, the results of whldh cannot &quot;applied until such time as the council thinks fit-   We are, &quot;so to speak, engaged on an exercise such as might haw b$en &quot;given to a group of officers at one of our Staff C llleges9 wThis should give us considerable latitude as to our methods &quot;of procedure, ehoice of rapporteurs, formation of committees; &quot;and I would draw the attention of the Committee to one point &quot;in connection with this*&quot;In studying the two widest problems faced &quot;by the league &quot;of Rations, i,e. the organisation of the permanent Court of &quot;jTastice, and the Financial commission in Brussels^ the * Government, of the united states was invited to send a member&quot; &quot;to the committee ftf study, and in each case this Invitation &quot;was accepted,   This acceptance shows that the United States &quot;Government takes an interest in the activities of the league &quot;in matters of Justice and economics; and if this interest &quot;extends to our efforts in the direction of a reduction of warmsaJsntSp we can only welcome the assistance of her repre-sentative in this matter.   1 need hardly point out the added &quot;wei-,ht that would attach to the work of the league in this ttrespect in the eyes of the world generally, if it were felt &quot;that ths  sited states ?;as co-operating in it.&quot;1 would therefore propose that we suggest to the Council &quot;that a letter of invitation be sent.&quot;I am,&quot;Sir,&quot;Your obedient servant,(Sgd.)   g.5.

TO tip, crowdy^R!::&apos;&quot;^ 0? th^l UaITTRj stat^ \The Council of the Lca^uo of Nations., act inn; on a unanimous re commendation cf the Permanent Militnry, Naval and Air Commission of the League passed at its meeting in Geneva on November 25th, invitee the Government of the. United States to name repr Bent at i v ^ s to sit on that Commission in a con-suitative capacity, during th? study by the Commission of&apos; the.. Question of th&apos;- reduction of armaments, a study :&quot;:uoh th^ ^cuneil has requested the Commission to un--iert-?.l:e forthwith.Tho P.rman-nt Advisory Commission was constituted hy the Council of the League at its mooting in Rome last May, and held its first session at 3a n Sebastian in August.. The Commission is at  ore sent composed, of military, naval and aerial officers of States represented on the Council of the League.     Its decisions are purely advisory md not in any sense binding, but th?y represent the common technical judg-ment of the experts of many countries.It would of course be perfectly understood that the presence of the representatives of tho United States would in no way commit the American Government to whatever opinions may be finally put forward in the Report of tho Commission, or indeed can that Report itself be more than a basis for the consideration by the Members of the League of the measures of re duct ien in armaments which united action may enable them to achieve-.     Nevertheless, just as, in the case of the Financial Conference at Brussels, the presence of an American Representative whose function was only that of giving and receiving information was an important factor in the success of the wor1: of the Conference, so it cannot be doubted that the general consideration of the subject of the reduction of armaments will be greatly facilitated if tho Government of the United States can see its way to be represented in a similar manner at the meetings of the Permanent Advisory commission n.
The pro &quot;fa! on is one to which public opinion in all countries attaches the highest impcrtanco,It is unnecessary to point out that the reduction of armaments is essential for tho well-toning of the world, and that unless nom^ no a sure of relief can be found by international co-operation for the &quot;Xce^sive luxation due to armaments, the general economic- situation,must become increasingly worse.The Council in extending this invitation cannot but hope that the (rover nment of the Un it e d St at e s, parties particularly in view of the past attitude of Atnerioa towards the question of the competition in arrcnmonts ^ill not refuse to associate itself with the Governments of the Members cf the^League in beginning the preliminary worh necessary for ultimate success, and to lend to the present effort an as si stan oc which can in no &quot;ray encroach upon its own perfect liberty of s ct.ion,,2 Whitehall Gardens, 3.7,1, December 13th, 1920.
