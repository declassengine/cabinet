Circulated by the Secretary of State for India, SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 6th December 1920.tersia. We have for some months deliberately refrained from tendering our views on Persian affairs, as we felt they would serve no useful purpose while policy with which we were unable to associate was on its trial. We only venture to intervene now because of note of despair struck by Minister in recent telegrams, amazing suggestion that we should connive at bribery of Majlis into acceptance of Anglo-Persian agreement, and the financial burden which, despite our protest, are still put on Indian taxpayer. These burdens are already a source of great political resentment in India, and are likely to be even more severely criticised in our new Councils.Position as we understand it is this : (a) If Majlis ratify agreement by end of the year &quot; we shall do our best to help them through.&quot; (6) If not, we are to withdraw our support from Persia in toto forthwith.As regards (a) we would point out (1) if bribery is resorted to, it will become open secret; (2) Ave shall not escape scandal that will, attach to it; (3) we shall be as far as ever from practical acceptance of agreement in country at large ; (4) its enforcement will arouse renewed passive, and probably active, resistance ; (5) it will afford fresh excuse and stimulus for Bolshevik aggression; and (C) in view of very strong current of Indian opinion and of our financial stringency, we ourselves must resist more resolutely than ever the saddling on India of any share in any financial commitments under or consequent on agreement.As regards (b) Persian finances and affairs generally seem now in such confusion that, if we abruptly withdraw from Persia, she will almost inevitably either (1) drift into chaos, into which Bolshevism will rapidly enter, or (2) seek financial and other support elsewhere, eg., from Soviet Russia or America. Can His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment contemplate either contingency ?Three conclusions seem now forced on us: (I) that Anglo-Persian agreement will never be genuinely accepted as it stands ; (2) that Persia will not be able, in our lifetime, to raise an Army lit to oppose external enemy; and (3) that any policy involving direct financial or military assistance on our part must inevitably prevent growth of that nationalist spirit, which, is, in the long run, our real defence against incursion of Bolshevism. If these are facts, then time has come to face them resolutely and to re-adjust policy to suit them.Our constructive proposals are these. We should forestall rejection of agreement by whittling it down to limit which would be acceptable to Persia and meet her imperative need, which is a sufficient flow of revenue to carry on her miserable administration, and keep up some force for internal law and order. Sinister experi-ment seems to show that expert foreign control of finance would not only be welcomed by Persia, but may be expected to bring about large increase of State revenues. His Majesty&apos;s Government are in a position to secure (? first hand) evidence of present Financial Adviser on both points under existing conditions. If it is favourable, and if the British personnel would be still acceptable to Persia and not likely to provoke Bolshevik aggression, then we advocate concentrating on British Financial Adviser, whose presence would ensure us real but unostentatious influence in Persian affairs.Cossack Brigade and South Persian Rifles should be handed over to Persia to be officered by her as she likes. If she chooses to bring in foreign element we should not object, though we shall endeavour to guide her choice into unobjectionable channel. In any case sharp drop in efficiency is inevitable. But while neither the (? word omitted) nor any other Persian force will ever be fit for use against external enemy, they will be as good for internal law and order as anything Persia has ever had.As regards external enemies, as soon as Persia realises that she must look after her external defence herself, she will make shift with her own Oriental methods of .^)lO       diplomacy.   Our own disappearance into the background will rob Bolshevism of her one valid excuse, and possibly remove temptation for open aggression. 2SS9-2      100  12.20
These proposals are devoid of attractiveness of elaborate proposals under the Anglo-Persian Agreement. But they have at least this to commend them. They are designed to square with the facts. To tis, at any rate, it seems that we have failed because we have tried to do too much. Realising that nothing Persian can be ever efficient we sought efficiency in the only possible way; the infiltration of Persian administration by British officers. Persian nationalism, however, has proved too strong for Persia to accept this willingly, and Ave are unable to face military and financial commitments (? involved in) forcing matters through. We should reconcile ourselves, therefore, to a (? continuance of the) inefficiency and corruption that are endemic in Persia, and simply try to avoid (? reproach) (which also constitutes the greatest danger to ourselves) that where we found gross maladministration we left chaos. In short, we should leave Persia to work out her own salvation, simply providing her with assistance which she needs most, and which, is the only assistance she is likely, of her own free will, to accept from us, viz., a Financial Adviser.We have not thought fit to repeat this to Minister.
