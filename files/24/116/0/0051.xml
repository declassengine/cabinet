A.!:&quot;&quot; TY&apos;S 00Vv,,-&apos;.Wir TT).I.P.2251.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICP ORGANISATION.Note by the Home Secretary covering a Memorandum by Sir Malcolm Delevingne.I circulate for the information of my colleaguea a Memorandum submitted by Sir Malcolm Delevingne.(Initialled)   3, S.Home Office, S.&quot;.December 7th 1920,
INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFJOE ORGANISATION&quot;.MEMORANDUM      SIR MALCOLM DEkEVINaftiS.The nwmorandum o*P*3067 circulated to the Cabinet by Sir Montagu Barlow and Mr. Hipwood, jmts forward a proposal that all the work in connection with the International Labour Conference and the International Labour Office (established under the Treaty of Peace) should be centred at the Ministry of Labour?   that an interdepartmental Committee should be oreated at the Ministry, to be presided over by the Minister of Labour or the Parliamentary Seoretary of the Ministry;   and that a special branch should be oreated at the Ministry which would be responsible for this international work. .....This proposal would apparently have the effect of placing the general cuitrol of all the work in the hands of the Ministry of Labour and of subordinating the official representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office   to the Ministry of Labour.&apos; It seems to me wreng that this work Bhould be regarded as the special business of any one department.   The work of the International Labour Organisation covers a wide field and many Government departments; are concerned besides the Ministry of Labour - the Home Office in regard to its industrial&quot; work, restrictions on alien workers eto.j   the Board of Trade in regard to mines, and employment at sea;   the Ministry of Transport in regard to employment on railways and in other transport industries;   the Board of Agriculture in regard,to agricultural employ-ment;   the.Ministry of Health;   the Board of Education in regard to technical and vocational education;   the Scottish Office;   the Colonial Office in regard to the colonies etc.    I imagine these Departments would not be satisfied that their special business should all be filtered through the&apos;Ministry of Labour, or that the.Ministry of Labour should be the medium of submitting it to the Cabinet.In the second place, the work has important international aspects, and will also be closely related with the work of the League of Nations (of which the International Labour Organisation forms a part), and of the other International Organisations which will be attached to the League, (Health, Economics, Statistics etc).    The arrangements made ought to be such as to ensure adequate consideration for the international, as well as the national, aspects of the work.   This oan only be done, I think; by associating it in some way with the other international work of the Government,&apos; :&apos; &apos;,.&apos;.--** -.. v..- tvjIn the third place, I doubt if any departmental organisation of the kind proposed would carry enough weight.   In connection with the agenda of the annual Conference,1 and other matters, questions &quot;of policy arise from time to time&apos; which require the deoision of the Cabinet.   Pressure-may have to be*brought to bear on particular Departments.  Whatever
-2-organisation therefore is set up for dealing with the International Labour Office work should be made as strong and as authoritative as possible *On the other.&apos;terid there is np doubt that sproe^,organisation for dealing with the International Labour Office work is urgently needed. (I disoussed the question with the Secretary of the Cabinet earlier in the year and I referred to the natter in the report&quot;t recently made on the work of the International Labour Organisation-see especially pp&apos;.16-17).  The work is growing rapidly,- numerous; questions are arising whioh ought not to be dealt with in an isoljated 1 or haphazard way, - and we ought to take a definite and consistent&quot; line in.regard to them and generally in regard to the work of the organisation..At present the position iB rather chaotic.  As the,British effioial representative on the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, i submit any important proposals made or questions raised by the International Labour Office, and make any reports that are neoessary. to the Cabinet Office.    At first the Cabinet Office circulated these to the Departments interested for consideration and aotion. jointly; or separately as might-be ^necessary    Lately Sir. Mi Hankey: (as a provisional arrangement, so- he tells oev pending, a definite settlement on the question of organisation)r has taken.to referring, any international labour questions which are sent to him by, me to1 the Ministry of Labour to deal with&apos; and thet Ministry of - Labour    j aiay either &quot;summon a oonferenoe of the: departments interested 4o ,, cfonsider the &quot;matter or may deal with it rby correspondence with the -.. Departments; &apos; The prooedure is slow and. not. effective..     . ?Two things are essential (1) a permanent interdepartmental Committee or Council (2) a&apos;secretariat..,&quot;?-!! The Comm&apos;it.tpds.iJB wanted for: consultation- on, questions of ,policy.^-evgr-the line to be taken by the, Government in regard tp tfte. items on the agenda of ant International Labour Conference, or .t,he -au;J . action to. be taken on the conventions and recommendations adopted by a Conference.   It should be as strong as possible and noi large, and it should not, in my opinion, be attaohed to any particular Department/ It should be appointed by the Cabinet and should report to the Cabinet. through the Cabinet Office.   It should also be&quot; in close touch with the section in the Cabinet which deals with the League of Nations&apos; work,-.    Suoh a Committee need only oont a in representatives of^-thg. j Departments chiefly interested (say Home. Office, rMinis.try .of:Lab,our:, Board of Trade and Ministry of Transport) and the Cabinet, Of  doe..... Other Departments would have the right to be represented when any question specially affecting their Department Was under considernation.;-. The selection 6f the Chairman of the Committee, would be. imjbdrtant. He should   . if possible be someone ;in touch f ith ;international affairs*; and also,someone, who would carry weight with the Cabinet. -The .,--...;
j - &apos; 203representative of Great Britain on the Council of the League  for the time being would seem the natural person to appoint, but if that is not possible at the present moment, it is worth considering whether Mr* Barnes might not be invited to aot as Chairman.Given a satisfactory constitution of *  and independent position for, the Committee, it does not matter very muoh perhaps where the Secretariat is located.  I should prefer it to be either in the Cabinet Office or to be separate from any Department (as Ib the secretariat which the Italian Government has established for the work) but if the Ministry of Labour are very anxious to haVe the secretariat at the Ministry, and provided its relations with the Committee are properly defined and guaranteed, we might agree.   It ought to be quite small, a Seoretary and one or two clerical and typist staff.(Signed)    MalCOLN DELEVIME.7R.40-42.
