Last week we gave Press criticisms on resolution on non-co-operation. We now give summary of impressions formed by correspondents regarding reception. In many quarters educated Indians recognise that resolution should be welcomed as an attempt to rally sober, intelligent, Indian opinion against non-co-operation, and approve decision of Government not to adopt repressive measures, as arrests would embarrass moderate Indians. At the same time, in some quarters, felt that great harm done to prestige and authority of Government, that mischief makers should be suppressed, and that present policy of non-intervention is likely to endanger safety of Government if carried on indefinitely. Race hatre&apos;d is increasiug which is calculated to lead to an explosion. Other Indians adopt a via media. They think that policy of conciliation not yet had full trial and should be continued. At the same time they recognise that seditious activities are most harmful but are not peculiar to India and can be handled better by patience than by repression. High prices have given agitator weapon he has been quick to use. Extremists thrive on anti-Government agitation and would welcome repression. They do not fear it as it will mean a further agitation for their release. Gandhi and Shaukat Ali have been touring Southern India exhorting Brahmins and non-Brahmins to forego their differences while task of attaining Swaraj before them. Gandhi has opened new National University and 70 students enrolled at Ahmedabad with himself as Chancellor. Two lakhs collected for purpose mainly subscribed by cloth merchants. Mahomed Ali has visited Benares and Allahabad during week with a view to push non-co-operation movement amongst students, but reported little effect produced in either place. Students awaiting arrival of Gandhi at Benares before finally deciding action. Opinion among them sharply divided. Malaviya exerting all his influence to keep situation in hand. At Aligarh, corre-spondence been published demanding from Ali Brothers accounts of collections made by them during the last 12 years. Trustees fortified by their success in first round and determined to pursue struggle, have decided to embark on propaganda against non-co-operation.As to withdrawal of boys from schools and colleges, non-co-operation work receding somewhat into background, non-co-operators finding work difficult and calculated to elicit opposition. Shafi writes from Bombay that non-co-operation movement having practically no effect in Bombay except in Ahmedabad, and one place in Gujrat. Even in these two places only small seciion of student population affected. On the other hand, Students&apos; Convention of United Provinces, held at Agra, adopted non-co-operation resolution, afte prolonged discussion, by large majority, and expressed sympathy with students of Aligarh and other colleges. Students in Islamia College, Lahore, have struck, and building is now under police protection. On whole,-however, sober opinion of trustees of educational institutions and parents generally is strongly opposed to movement as directed against education of school children and students.As to elections reported from Bombay that some 80 per cent, of voters abstained from polling one day but no absence of candidates in any province, and for some part of elections keenly contested. In very few places have extremists been able to carry out their threat of putting up men of straw to oppose bond-fide candidates.In public, however, non-co-operators, owing to superior organisation and careful propaganda, have advantage. There is always difficulty in carrying resolutions against non-co-operation ; for example, a meeting held at Broach for this purpose was captured by non-co-operators, due to careless organisers, and actual resolution adopting non-co-operation was passed. Gandhi seems to desire to try conclusions openly with Government, his latest effusion being an article entitled &quot; If I were arrested,&quot; stating what he would expect his followers to do in that eventuality. The Amrita Bazar Patrika has recanted on non-co-operation as preached and practised by Gandhi, and New India continues to combat the movement.Bombay. Elections passed off peaceably. Our posters regarding intimidation to voters probably induced Gandhi to issue his appeal to effect that non-co-operationists should cease from persuasion on the 15th and should confine their activities to the 16th instant to meeting away from poll booths. He spent a fortnight touring in 2833     100  11.20
Gujerat and in the Deccan, and on the eve of his departure from Alimedabad announced that untouchables have a right to be admitted to national schools. As a result, a local national school declined to act on this ruling, orthodox circles have been offended ; and in addition, the announcement has failed to fulfil its main object, the capture of non-Brahmin adherence in the Deccan to his campaign. Indications, that small results achieved to date making him despondent. Percentage of those who voted was very small. A central Khilafat committee meeting at Aligarh has been fixed for the 21st instant to consider national education, and it is asserted that the National Moslem University scheme will be launched, though there are practically no funds either for University or for non-co-operation movement as a whole.Bengal.-Calcutta and. whole of Bengal observed second anniversary of Armistice Day on 11th November, normal business work and locomotion being suspended. Non-co-operation movement not made much headway. In most districts general public unaffected, one Pauchayat only having resigned in 2-4 Parganas. Well-&apos; attended meetings held, but with no appreciable result. Bengal Khilafat Committee, more concerned at present with collecting funds than pushing propaganda, 30 lakhs of rupees being required. Latest device, issue of one-rupee receipts, resembling one-rupee note in size and shape but superscribed in Urdu with quotation from Qoran. Though purporting to be a receipt, some private people will be deceived. For example, a litigant offered his pleader fees in these receipts. They were, of course, promptly returned. Press reports indicate these receipts have reached Rangoon, also at Madras. Legal, opinion is being taken as to means of stopping them. National School started in Calcutta, but likely to collapse. Some trouble among students in Chittagong, but elsewhere waiting a lead from more important institutions. No indication that this feature of non-co-operation will gain, much support in Bengal. Opinion freely expressed by educated Mohamedans that Hindus have engineered movement against Government Schools with a view to retarding Mohamedan develop-ment. Attempt to boycott new Councils not met with much success. No instance of seat for which no candidate forthcoming. For five seats Council of State 11 candi-dates, and Bengal Chamber of Commerce seat only one uncontested. For 17 seats in Legislative Assembly 38 candidates nominated and contests everywhere except (?) in two constituencies. For Provincial Council 327 candidates to 113 seats. No contest in 19 constituencies out of 94. Strike fever continues, but so far its manifestations confined mainly to Calcutta and has no political significance.United Provinces. First resuTts of Aligarh incident been set back to propaganda of non-co-operators, but anti-European feeling very strong and students thoroughly excited. Independent continues to advertise non-co-operation and Leader to denounce it. Vernacular papers have condemned interference with educational institutions, and whole-hearted supporters of this aspect of movement in vernacular Press appear to be few.Punjab.--Conferences held during week at Hoshiarpur and Rohtak. Speeches violently anti-Government. At Rohtak a speaker opposing non-co-operation howled down, fracus ensuing, and meeting being broken up. Considerable excitement amongst student class and demonstrations, and, in many cases, absence without leave, but movement regarded with disfavour by people at large as promised national schools do not seem likely to materialise. Amritsar-Klialsa College and one or two other schools, however, still temporarily closed. Pressure being brought to bear on title holders to surrender titles, and in the event of refusal threatened with social boycott. But nominations for elections to new Councils not appreciably affected. Adoption of non-co-operation by Central Sikh League at Lahore has led to increase in agitation in Jullundur and Hoshiarpur districts and Lieutenant-Governor anxious to apply Seditious Meetings Act. In deference, however, to our wishes he has taken action under section 3(C) of Defence of India Rules restricting a few of the more violent speakers from these places from attending or making speeches at public meetings for a year. This policy been pursued with some success and without undue comment in (?) Bengal. At Amritsar District Magistrate issued order prohibiting holding of Khilafat Conference, 19th, 20th, and 21st, and presenting address to Colonel Wedgwood in Jallianwala Bagh on 19th. Gandhi sent telegram to reception Committee to obey Magistrate^ order and Conference postponed under protest and presentation of address to Colonel Wedgwood cancelled. Amritsar municipality at special meeting resolved to ask for cancellation of indemnity levied on city, and also to relieve the Committee of collections on motion of Satya Pal.Delhi. Expiry of application of Seditious Meetings Act immediately taken1 advantage of by extremists for holding frequent meetings at which seditious language-
used, and particularly at mosques by certain preachers. A fatwa signed by Ahmed Said justifying not only non-co-operation but forcible resistance examined to see if prosecution would lie, but legal opinion against this as document is interspersed with quotations from Qoran. Meetings suddenly discontinued as promoters feared intro-duction of Seditious Meetings Act with a view to stoppage of Conference of Ulemas on 21st, but we have decided to allow Conference to take place. Gandhi arrives here to-day and will attend Provincial Congress on 23rd, over which Mahomed Ali will preside. In practice Gandhi&apos;s policy not meeting with much success. Anglo-Arabic School Committee reopened?school after live clays&apos; holiday. All masters except one at work and two-thirds of the boys attending. National School which Asif Ali started has no funds and no provisional staff, and fewer students than any recently started school in a similar stage of development. National Arbitration Court at a standstill. Six candidates for Delhi seat in Legislative Assembly. Four candidates of good standing, two men of straw, petty traders, put up by non-co-operators to throw ridicule on. elections.Bihar and Orissa. Non-co-operation movement not made much progress, but efforts will be made to stimulate it during Gandhi&apos;s visits towards the end of the month. Agitation more vigorous in Patna Division than elsewhere, where Maghar-ul-Huq is taking lead. Movement, however, said to be killing itself, and consciousness of this fact partly accounts for violent speeches. For 68 constituencies Legislative Council, 184 candidates nominated, 17 candidates returned unopposed ; no nomina-tions for two non-Mahomedan rural constituencies, Shahabad and Darbhanga. For 12 constituencies Legislative Council, 25 candidates nominated; no candidates for Bhagalpur Mahomedan constituencies. For Council of State, three candidates for non-Mahomedan constituencies and two for Mahomedans. New Legislative Council of Bihar and Orissa will be entirely in the hands of landlord party, pleaders experiencing utmost difficulty in securing election to any constituency in Bihar unless representing landed interests and supported by landowners. Efforts being made to stir up unrest among school teachers and colliery employees on ground of inadequacy of wages.Central Provinces. There has been somewhat of a lull in non-co-operation propaganda. Prosecution of Tajuddin, Editor of the take , under sections 153 (A) and 505, Indian Penal Code, reported to have shown effect at Jubbulpore. Khaparde refuses to resign candidature for Council of State in spite of pressure and social boycott. No sign of trouble among college students at Nagpur. Volunteer organisa--tions of Sewa Samaj and Khilafat volunteers showing increased activity in few districts, but not of nature to give any ground for alarm. Proposals in regard to export of wheat continue to excite angry comment, and extremist Press devotes considerable space to death of McSwiney.North-West Frontier Province. Example of Aligarh followed to some extent at Islamia College, Peshawar, and certain students announced intention of joining-National University to be established by Mohamed Ali at Aligarh. This proposal, however, not&apos; yet translated into practice. Zafar Ali&apos;s conviction received without excitement. Partial hartal started in Peshawar city, but shops opened by 10 o&apos;clock same morning. President, Bannu Khilafat Committee, has withdrawn and asked for reinstatement as honorary magistrate, which he had previously resigned in pursuance of non-co-operation programme. Wedgwood&apos;s visit to Peshawar has again aroused undesirable political excitement, particularly in school and college.- Closed as precautionary measure. Complete hartal on 18th, owing to imprisonment of three leading agitators in default of furnishing security under section 40, Frontier Crimes Piegulations.Assam. Viceroy&apos;s visit successful in spite of attempts of non-co-operation, and when they had succeeded in preventing presentation of address to Viceroy, welcomed by representative gatherings including most of Hindu and Mahomedan leaders. Candidates, one or more for every seat, and nearly all prominent politicians except Chanda offering themselves for election. He too allows it to be understood that he will welcome a Government nomination if Provincial Congress reverses resolutions of Calcutta Special Congress on non-co-operation. Students of Sylhet Madrassa some-what affected by non-co-operation movement.Net result is that non-co-operation has not made much progress in regard to elections or in schools, &amp;c, but it has made students restless, but this anti-Govern-ment feeling promoted by speakers and the extremist Press is spreading, and-among Mahomedans in some quarters social boycott is being used to intimidate those who do not sympathise. Feeling is more acute and situation more disturbing in Punjab and Bombay than elsewhere.
