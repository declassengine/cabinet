it [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1920.SECRET.C.P.-2223.CABINET.CONCENTRATION OF GOVERNMENT LAND VALUATION. memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.1. I HAVE carefully considered the Memorandum (C.P.-2128) presented to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War and Air and the Minister of Munitions on the above subject, and I wish to make the following observations.2. The authors of the Memorandum are in agreement with my view that it is desirable to concentrate all the Government valuation work in one Department, which would be responsible for all purchases, sales and valuations on behalf of all other Government Departments. They state, however, that there are the following grave objections to the employment or the Inland Revenue Valuation Office for that purpose: &quot;(a.) The Inland Revenue Valuation Department, as at present organised, would be quite incapable of carrying out the work, because they have little or no experience of the extremely difficult and complicated negotiations involved in transactions of the magnitude of many of those which are being dealt with by the Lands Directorate;&quot;(6.) It would be impossible to carry out satisfactorily much of the work on which the Lands Directorate is engaged unless the services of the present staff, or the better part of it, can be retained, a result which we are satisfied, after careful enquiry, could not be attained if the work is to be transferred to the Inland Revenue Valuation Department.&quot; (c.) Whilst appreciating the work which the Inland Revenue Valuation Department have carried out in the past, we feel bound to point out that their work has been almost entirely connected with the valuation of property. The work of the Lands Directorate, however, both on behalf of the ^Departments it represents and for the Disposal Board, is of an administrative kind, and includes negotiating the purchase and sale of every class of property, as well as the disposal and valuation of machinery, camps, aerodromes, huts and buildings of every description.&quot;3. I will deal with objections (a) and (c) together, and in doing so I wish to make it clear that I have in mind the permanent work which normally falls to be performed on behalf of the Departments for which the Lands Directorate now acts as well as for other Departments, and not the aftermath of the war which the Lands Directorate is. at present engaged in clearing up.4. These objections amount in substance to a statement that the Inland Revenue Valuation Office as at present organised is quite incapable of carrying out the work which would fall upon it. I am amazed that such a suggestion should have been made. Throughout the war the Inland Revenue Valuation Office acted and still acts on behalf of the Admiralty in precisely the same capacity as the Lands Directorate acts on behalf of the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Munitions, and since the war it has acted on behalf of the Ministry of Health and the Board of Agriculture in the purchase by local authorities of sites for housing and Jand settlement purposes respectively.The evidence that they have successfully performed the task imposed upon them is overwhelming. My colleagues who are at the head of the Departments concerned have testified in complimentary terms to the value of the work which has been performed on their behalf by the Inland Revenue Valuation Department.But I do not rely alone on expressions of opinion which, it might be alleged, were mere departmental courtesies. Evidence of the most pertinent&apos; character has been given on behalf of the Departments who have received assistance from the Inland[5041]
Revenue Valuation Department before at any rate one tribunal which might be expected to be hostile to any extension of the activities of the Inland Revenue Valuation Department, namely, the Select Committee on National Expenditure.I desire to call the attention of the Cabinet to the following extracts ,fj&apos;om the. report of that Committee : Paragraph 20. &quot;The Ministry of Health, Admiralty and Post Office consider that the services received have been invaluable and have been carried out with conspicuous zeal and efficiency, and have tended to economy on a large scale. By utilising the Valuation Department, its records, and the services of its specialised staff, they have saved vast expansions of their own Departments which would have involved substantial charges on public funds. Reports handed in to the Committee from these Departments form appendices to this report.&quot;Paragraph 26 (v), Conclusions. &quot;Where the practice has been followed by Government Departments of utilising the machinery of the Valuation Office to assist them in their duties, it has been established to&apos; the satisfaction of the Committee that the work has been done in a satisfactory manner and has resulted . ,in considerable saving to the State. The decentralised organisation&apos; of the Valuation Office; with offices throughout the- kingdom, renders it suitable to act in this&apos;capacity on behalf of Government Departments generally.&quot;The conclusions of that Committee-are considerably reinforced by paragraph 67 of the third report from the Committee of Public Accounts, which runs as follows :     . &apos;. Paragraph 67. &quot; We are glad to learn that in connection with the provisions of new Admiralty establishments, involving the purchase of lands and.1 buildings on an extensive scale, the Admiralty employed with satisfactory results the Chief Valuer&apos; of the Inland Revenue. We should like to- be informed what is the present policy with regard to the&apos; utilisation of Inland Revenue Valuers by Public Depart-ments generally, and whether that process could with advantage be extended.&quot;5. As regards&apos; the second objection (&amp;) in my colleagues&apos; Memorandum, I have already stated that the policy of&quot; concentration is: primarily directed to- the normal permanent work which falls to be performed on behalf of Government Departments generally, and not to the abnormal temporary work arising out of the war which the Lands Directorate is *now engaged in clearing up. The difficulties of transferring that work to other hands is.sufficiently obvious, audit will probably be found advisable to maintain the Lands Directorate as a separate entity for the purposes of completing the work in hand.6. I trust i have said&apos;enough to dispose of the suggestion that the Inland Revenue Valuation Office is not competent to undertake the permanent tasks of a unified Department dealing-with and responsible for all Government valuation work. Indeed, so far from this being the case, there is at the present time no other Department equipped with an organisation capable of dealing with Government valuation work. The Inland Revenue has a network of Valuation Offices throughout the country; its Valuation Department has in recent years valued practically every hereditament in the country;. and, in close association with other Departments of the Inland Revenue, it has assembled,, and continues day by day to receive, a mass of information, constituting an entirely unique record of values and ownerships of land, which for revenue purposes must be: automatically kept up to date.7. The issue is thus narrowed down to the question whether the Valuation. Office, strengthened by the absorption of such additional staff as is necessary to enable it to cope with its additional functions, should remain with the Inland Revenue or be transferred to another Department.8. In favour of transfer there is nothing but a nebulous allegation of hostility, due to its: association with the Land Value Duties, which have now been repealed.There is little doubt that in the period succeeding the passing of &quot; The Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910,&quot; an atmosphere of hostility engendered by political considera-tions existed in regard to the Valuation Office. This feeling has gradually subsided; indeed, at the outbreak of war it had already practically disappeared. Hostility on anything but a negligible scale is now non-existent, and, indeed, I am somewhat embarrassed by the demands for its services from, local authorities and even private individuals, and I have found it necessary to limit the assistance to be given to local authorities to such assistance as can be given within the limits of the existing staff.On the other hand, the arguments in favour of the retention of the Valuation Office as a branch of the Inland Revenue are overwhelming.
I need hardly remind my colleagues that the efficient control and management of a large and wide-flung technical machine requires great administrative experience as well as ability, and in the nature of things the Inland Revenue Department has had to acquire such experience as a necessary element in the administration of the duties under their charge. But, apart from this, it is,- in my opinion, essential that the Inland Revenue authorities should have under their control and direction an expert valuation staff capable of advising them on the numerous valuation problems which arise in the day-to-day administration of the revenue.It is obvious that the main work of any organisation established to deal with Government Valuation work would be work directly connected with the Inland Revenue Department. It seems to me equally obvious that in these circumstances the Commissioners of Tnland Revenue are the proper authority to control an organisation which will in the main be concerned with matters for which they are directly and solely responsible. Incidentally, I may mention that some of the functions which they perform are statutory e.g., the functions imposed upon them by &quot; The Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910,&quot; andThe Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919  and legislation would be necessary to transfer those functions to another authority. Such legislation might be difficult to pass : it will be remembered that during the passage of &quot; The Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919,&quot; a considerable body of opinion expressed itself in favour of correlating compensation with taxation, and the functions allotted to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under that Act were allotted to them in virtue of their being a taxing authority. To relieve them of these functions would in my view be regarded as a retrograde step.10. Again, it has been common ground for many years that the system of rating valuation in this country must be drastically reformed, and the almost unanimous opinion is that there should be a valuation list binding both for rating and taxing purposes. Indeed, I am at the present time in consultation with the Minister iof Health with a view to the framing of proposals on these lines. Whether or not this Bill passes into law in the near future, it is certain that legislation on similar lines cannot be very long delayed. When that time arrives it is clear that, in view of the very large amount of national revenue involved (some 50,000,000^.), the Inland Revenue authorities must be endowed with very considerable powers of criticism and control, and these powers can only be effectively exercised through the medium of a decentralised body of expert valuers working in the closest co-operation with the other main branches of the Inland Revenue service.11. So far I have written only of the conditions of the moment and of the immediate future. If at any time the scheme of taxation of this country embraced a general tax on the value of all land, such a tax, as experience shows, could not be effectively levied under a system of dual control, and the severance of the Valuation Office from the Board of Inland Revenue would in that contingency produce an impossible situation.12. I now come to the question of estate management of properties vested in the Government. On this subject I have a perfectly open mind, and as at present advised I have no reason to challenge the views expressed in the Memorandum under review. But I think the question of estate management should be further explored by a Committee appointed for that purpose, and that its terms of reference should comprise the wider question as to how far it is expedient that a change should be made in Government policy as to holding investments in land, and whether Departments such as the Office of Woods and Forests should exchange their holdings in land for other forms of investment. This, however, is a distinct question. The decision upon it, whatever it may be, will not alter my view upon the main issue which my colleagues have raised.(Initialled)     A. C.Treasury, S.W.,December 1, 1920.P.S. Whilst this Memorandum was being prepared, Sir Frederick Banbury informed me that the Committee on National Expenditure had received further communications from the Army Council and Sir Howard Frank. He wished me to understand that the Committee were clearly in favour of the concentration of valuation work in one Department, that they were equally clear that that Department should be the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue, and that they were definitely and decisively opposed to the creation of a new Department for the purpose.(Initialled)     A.
