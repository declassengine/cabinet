\2lh December 1020. (Received 1.3th, 10 a.in.)(Hear the line.1420 S. Now that it has been decided to send Mission to Kabul, there are various matters requiring urgent consideration.Firstly. Question of recognition&apos;of Amir&apos;s title of His Majesty. In our telegram No. 1201 S., dated 15th October .1920, we draw your attention to vital importance of this point.. Our Mission will be hopelessly handicapped if they are not authorised to address Amir by title which he has assumed, and it is more than likely that the whole negotiations may break down upon this petty matter, in which Amir&apos;s amour propre is obviously involved. Moreover, if negotiations reach, pitch at which Amir is ready to sign treaty to our liking, it is inconceivable that lie would do so without use in it of title which lie claims. We cannot believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government can desire deliberately to impose this grave embarrassment upon our Mission, and to weaken its position from the start, and we trust we may receive very early orders permitting recognition of title in question.Secondly. Publication of any agreement which &quot;may be signed with Amir, It seems clear that under Article No. 18 of League of Nations Covenant, we shall be bound to publish agreement, and it seems necessary to inform Amir of this obligation at outset. Do -you agree? This may incidentally strengthen our hand in demanding details of Aniir&apos;s agreement with Bolsheviks.Thirdly. Question of Afghan representative in London. Under para. No. 6 B. of Mussoorie Aide-Memoire point was specifically reserved for further discussion at the time of negotiating a treaty of friendship. It was brought forward by the Afghan Delegates at Mussoorie, and pressed by them with considerable persistence, and it is clear that they attach much importance to it as a test of British sincerity, in giving to Afghanistan independent status in foreign affairs. After renewed and anxious-consideration, we are of opinion that the claim of Afghanistan to representation in London cannot longer be logically withstood. Afghanistan may rightly expect equality in this matter with such States as Persia and Si am, which are much less powerful than she. Our release from control of her foreign relations clearly gave her status of all other independent nations, and to refuse her request can only fill her with suspicion of our real intentions. We fully realise the embarrassment which may be caused, both to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to Government of India by change which we now advocate. Tendency of Afghans will be possibly to try to play off His Majesty&apos;s Government, against Government of India, and there may be other inconveniences, but these must, we fear, be faced.Fourthly.-Question of rectification of the frontier at, Torkham. This is explained in note enclosed by Foreign Secretary to Political Secretary in secret demi-official letter 259 F., dated 14th October 1920, and we should be glad to be able to authorise Dobbs to make .capital out of suggested concession, ii this appears -advantageous, and would help negotiations.From Viceroy, Foreign, and Political Department,
