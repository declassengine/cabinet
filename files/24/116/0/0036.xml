THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNHSECRET.-IRISH   RAiLWIS.\Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Ministry of Transport.2238    ), ]]f ^ IPossession was not taken of the Irish Railways in August 1914 when it was taken of most of the railways in Great Britain, as it was not considered necessary for military reasons that this should be done.In December 1916 a strike was threatened by the loco-motive men on the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway, the war bonus which they were receiving being considerably legs than that which was being paid to the men employed by the British Companies.    The Irish Companies claimed that they   could not pay an increase unless they had assistance from the Government as in Great Britain, and some of them were not prepared to discuss the question of an increase with their men.    There was serious risk that the strike if it took place would spread and the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Mr. Duke, urged on the President of the Board of Trade, Lord Ashfield, that possession should be taken of the Irish Companies to enable them to pay the war bonus which otherwise they said they were not able to do.The matter was referred to the Cabinet who agreed. Meetings were held in Dublin with the Companies and with the men.   The former were quite willing that their lines should be taken over and if this were done the men were willing to withdraw their notices to leave work which had been lodged, possession was taken of the undertakings of the Irish Railway Companies under the provisions of Section 16 of the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, as from 1st January, 1917, and an increase was made in the war bonus the men were receiving, though not quite up to the level of Great Britain and assistance was promised to the Irish Companies to pay the increased war bonus for the last two weeks of December 1916.The Companies1 duties as common carriers remained the same as they were before under the Railway and Canal
2Traffic Act.     That Is to say, they remained under the obligation to give reasonable facilities for receivings for- .... warding and delivering of traffic, and to give no undue preference to any particular traffic.Under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, the Directors, Officers and Servants of the Company came under the obligation to obey the directions of the Government as to the user of the railways for H,M. Services.    There is, however, nothing in the Agreement or in the negotiations referred to above to show that the objection in taking possession of the Railways was to secure the carriage of Government stores, although they were taken over under the Regulation of the Forces Act of 1871.Following the lines of the agreement made with the English Companies, an arrangement as regards the compensation to be paid to the Irish Companies was settled, the basis being a guarantee of the aggregate net receipts far the year of account ended next before January 1st, 1914.   The agreement, after placing an obligation upon each Irish Company to furnish a monthly statement of the estimated revenue receipts and expenditure as compared with the corresponding period in 1913, places an obligation upon the Irish Rai&amp;riiy Executive Committee to make claims from month to month upon the Government for compensation upon the basis of the aggregate of such monthly returns, and states specifically that such claims shall be paid by the Government subject to audit.Section 5 (1) (a) of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, provides that where possession has been taken of any railroad Undertaking, in pursuance of Section 16 of the Act of 1871 possession shall be retained without any renewal of the warrant granted by the Secretary of State and that possession shall be retained upon the same terms as to com-pensation as those heretofore in force.     This provision remains operative for a period of two years after the passing of the Ministry of Transport, that is until August 15th, 1921.
Section 5 (1) (c) (iii) of the Ministry of Transport Act empowers the Minister-to--give directions as to the working or discontinuance of the working of any railroad undertaking or any part thereof, including directions as to the keeping open or closing of any stations, which directions the Directors, Officers and Servants of any Railway Company are to obey.Section 8 of the Ministry of Transport Act provides that if by reason of a Direction of the Minister the value of an Undertaking on a revenue earning basis has been reduced the Railway Company shall be entitled to be recouped the amount of such reduction.No trouble arose with regard to the carriage of Government stores until May, 1920, when following a general declaration by the National Union of Railwaymen that they would not handle munitions of war destined for Poland employees of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway Company refuse to move certain wagons stated to be loaded with munitions.   A-few days later the London &amp; North Western employees in Dublin refused to unload munitions from the Holyhead and Dublin steamer.    The Prime Minister saw a deputation of Trade Union leaders in London and made it clear that the Government mast insist on all traffic being carried.   The movement, however, spread rapidly and resulted in a general refusal on all railways, except some lines in Ulster, to carry certain forms of military traffic when tendered.   No disciplinary action was taken by the Companies until I addressed a letter to them on June 10th pointing out that &quot;discrimination againUS Government traffic cannot possibly be justified in view tf the fact that a-large subsidy is being paid by the Government to the Irish Railways,and the Railways at the present time are under Government
control.   If therefore, the men or a section of them persist in their present attitude the Companies should in the view of the Government deal with their employees in accordance with their Regulations relating to disobedience of Orders&quot;.As a result, most of the Railway Companies commenced to dismiss staff, and those servants who attempted to carry the traffic in the affected areas were subjected to serious intimidation.In July the principal Company affected (The Great Southern &amp; Vie stern) wrote with reference to a particular consignment&apos;&apos;&quot;we do not feel that it is just for my board to order men to do work that endangers their lives and unless &quot;*e have a distinct order from the Ministry or the Government we do not propose making further attempts to deal with these consignments under armed escort&quot;.The Irish Command at the same time intimated to the companies that they did not propose to use the railways for the transport of arms, munitions, explosives or motor spirit, but this intimation was cancelled after a few days.On 28th of July, I addressed a letter to the railway companies informing them t^at they must take all possible steps to ensure that traffic of every description was despatched. The railway companies, however, pressed for a ;. specific direction under the Act, and I therefore brought the matter before the Cabinet who on August 11th agreed in Conclusion 8 of Cabinet 47 (20)&quot;that providing the Irish Law Officers saw no objection, steps should now be taken to order the Irish Railways to give absolute priority to Government traffic, and that failure to give such priority should entail the loss of money payable under the Guarantee&quot;.
A direction was accordingly given to all Irish Railway Companies that equal facilities for tho roooiving, forwarding and delivering of all traffio, irrespective of whether it was Government traffic or otherwise, should he given and tho opinion of the English Attorney General was immediately sought as to whether, in the event of tho failure of any Irish Company to obey this direction, it would be open to the Government to treat the Compensation Agreement as being at an end and to withhold payment of the moneys provided Ity that Agreement to bo paid monthly.   !Eho Attorney General advised that if the servants of an Irish Company continued In spite of the direotion to rofuso to handle Government traffic and stoppage of the traffic generally resulted as a consequence, he did not think that that would be any justification in Law for a refusal by the Government to pay compensation undor the terms of the Agreement and that it did not appear to him that there was any means of escape from the pecuniary liability.On tho 14th october last, the Cabinet again had the matter before them, and I wish to refor to Conclusion 8 of Cabinet 65(20).   It is there noted that the views held by the Irish Secretary and myself were that whilst it would be a mistake to close down the Railways entirely, it was advisable to close down those lines on the south and west which wore not paying their out of pocket expenses? that at the same time, the lines which remained open and had Govornment traffio tendered to them should be directed to dismiss or suspend without payment, any railwaymen who refused to deal with such traffioj that in the event cf tho Railways failing to carry out those arrangements the Irish Government should be granted power by Order in Council to shut down such Railways;   further, that in due course
.* 6 mParliament should be asked to grant the Ministry of Transport power to cancel any particular Railway Agreements so that the shareholders of any Railways closed down in Ireland would have their dividends stopped.   The Cabinet agreed to accept these recommendations.Immediately prior to the Cabinet meeting on tho 14th October, I had met the principal Irish Railway Companies who gave mo an undertaking to oonour formally in any directions given to close lines or sections of lines subject to a proviso that their rights under the Agreements with the Government were not prejudiced.   In accepting this undertaking I made it clear that the Government must reserve to itself the right of dealing with the Railway situation in Iroland and the future application of such rights which the Irish Companies at present possessed in any way which thoy, or Parliament, might doom necessary or fitting, having regard to the circumstances existing from time to time.On November 12th a now regulation by Order in Council under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, 1920, was mado empowering the competent Haval or Military Authority, where it appeared to him to be necossary so to do with a view to the restoration or maintenance of Order in Ireland, to make orders rogulating, requiring, restricting or prohibiting the carriage of passengers and articles on Railways in Ireland.   Such an Order may be made applicable in relation to all Railways or to any part of a railway, and either generally as respects the carriage of all passengers and articles or as respects the carriage of passengers and articles of any class or description.   For the purpose of enforcing or securing compliance with the provisions of such an Order the competent Naval or Military Authority may tako possession of any Railway Undertaking or
any part thereof and may take such further or other stops as may in his opinion be necessary or expedient ]f or such purpose.Presont Position.ui i mm  i    i in hi mm   mm m*m* m* --wwwThe total mileage of lino which has beon olosed in Ireland up to the prosont timo amounts to 454 miles and a statement is attaohed (Appendix A.) giving details of such lines and also tho lines which remain open but upon irhioh tho aorvioos have been modified to some extent.A statement of the present financial position in. regard to the Irish Railways is given in Appendix B.It is not possible - owing to Joint and Trustee holdings - to say what proportion of Irish Railway Stock is hold by or for the benofit of Irish residents, but the enquiry whioh has beon made indicates that a very large proportion is so held. .- .The conclusions to bo drawn from the circumstances above narrated seem to be(1)   That if military traffic is extensively tendered the Railway services of the, South and West will be brought to a standstill in a few weeks.( )   lb at the liability of the Government to pay compensation under tho torms of the Quarahtoo Agreement cannot be got rid of prior to the 15th August next except by an Act of Farliamont.
(3)   !Hhat the Military Authorities oan, adter makingtho necessary orders requiring Govornmont traffic to be carried, take possession of any railway in Ireland for the purpose of securing compliance with such an order, hut that in such an event tho Government liability under the Guarantee would still continue.(4)   That if tho Government liability under thoGuarantee were cancelled by Act of Parliament the Irish Railways might close   down in a very short time of their own accord, but it is possible that thoy might re-engage their staff and restore full services.(5)   If by enactment the Government Guarantee Agreement is cancelled, there la nothing to prevent the Competent Military  Authority giving any directions thoy wish to any railway Company without any special pecuniary liability to the State.ERIC GE1DES.4th December, 1923.

Another 450 (approximately) -are on strike, and the services of another 750 (approximately) have been dispensed with in consequence of the lines havingbeen/
been closed.   This gives- -a-total ?f irpproxima-taly 2,J200 men out of employment.The under-mentioned lines are not (it has been proved by the number of refusals) in a position to carry all military traffic;Cavan and Leltrim RailwayCork and Muskerry Light RailwayCork and Macroom Railway, and Donoughmore ExtensionRai railway.Cork, Bandon &amp; South Coast Railway Dublin and Blessington SteanTramway Dublin and Lucen Electric Railway Dublin and South Eastern Railway Great Southern &amp; Western Railway Midland Great Western Railway Tralee and Dingle Light Railway West Clare Railway.The position on the under-mentioned lines is not known, but it is believed that no difficulty has arisen or would arise in respect of ensuring conveyance of all Government traffic:Ballyoastle RailwayBelfast and County Down Railway&quot;Bessbrook and Newry TramwayGi ant1s C ause w ay TramwayMidland Northern Counties RailwayCarrick fergus Harbour Junction Railway.The Great Northern (Ireland.) Railway have had con-siderable trouble with their staffs arid because of intimidation have closed certain sections of branch line, but where military traffic offers on their principal lines the Company appear .to be able to provide conveyance.The position on the following lines is uncertain:Castlederg and Victoria Bridge Railway Clogher Valley Railway . Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway qligo, Leitrim &amp; Northern Counties Railway ,    Dundalk, Newry and Greenore Railway,It is not known that there has been tender of military traffic on the undermentioned l$ es but it is improbable that conveyance of munitions and armed forces&apos;could/
could be effected:Cork, Elackrock and Passage RailwayListowel and Ballybunion Railway&quot;ohull and -kibbereen Tramway and Light Railway^aterford and Trar-more RailwayCork City Railways.The Timoleague and Courtmasherry line is closed by the direction of the  ..inister in consequence of the connecting line of the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway Company between. Clonakilty aid Clonkilty Junction being closed for traffic.   It is not known that there was any tender of military traffic on the Timoleague Railway but had there been it is feirly certain that it would have been refused conveyance.
