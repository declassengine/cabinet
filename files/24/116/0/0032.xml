Memorandum of the Secretary of State relating to the Army Supplementary Estimate for 1920-1921.A further sum of  29,750,000 is required for expenditure falling within the scope of the Army Estimates during the current financial year. The original Estimates submitted by the War Office to the Cabinet on the 7th February last amounted to a total of  134,000,000. Of this sum (leaving out for the moment the ordinary cost of British troops wherever employed)  42,000,000 was required to maintain British control in Constantinople, Palestine, Egypt, Mesopotamia and Persia. It was hoped that the garrisons in these theatres (consisting mainly of Indian troops) might be reduced in the course of the year to half the strength at which they then stood. In this hope I reduced my Estimates by  9,000,000, and presented them to Parliament at a net total of  125,000,000 I informed Parliament of these circumstances on introducing the Estimates, and I indicated that there was at least a possibility that this reduction would not be realized. *In respect of Constantinople, Egypt and Palestine, substantial savings on the original Estimate for Indian troops (though not on the Estimate as presented to Parliament) have in fact been effected, aggregating in all  2,750,000. But these are far more than offset by the expense due to the rebellion in Mesopotamia and the serious state of war which has been proceeding in that country without intermission since June, and by the long delay in procuring the withdrawal of the Indian troops from East Persia and of the Anglo-Indian force which is still in North-West Persia covering Teheran.In July the spread of the revolt in Mesopotamia rendered it imperative for the safety of our forces in that theatre to bring large reinforcements from India, and the equivalent of nearly two divisions of troops were despatched from India at War Office charge. The back of the rebellion has been broken, but all prospects of diminishing the garrison of Mesopotamia during the year have been destroyed, and instead we have at the present time 26,000 more troops in the country than in June. The return of these reinforcements to India is now under consideration, but their withdrawal from the country obviously depends upon its re-pacification and the setting up of an Arab Government capable of maintaining peace. It would be imprudent to look for any substantial relief before the end of the financial year.The force in North-West Persia has been detained by the disturbed conditions in those regions, which were threatened with invasion successively by Turkish and Bolshevik armies and by the delays in creating a Persian Army capable of affording protection to Teheran and preventing the collapse of government in that country. If this force is not molested by the enemy, it is intended to withdraw it as soon as the mountain passes become practicable. Should it be molested, however, further exertions may become necessary.The force in East Persia, which was stationed at Meshed during the Great War, has now been withdrawn. The operations of this force were wholly under the control of the Government of India. I had taken authority, before presenting the Estimates to order its immediate withdrawal, which would in any case have been a lengthy operation extending over 4 or 5 months. It was, however, found impossible for political, military and other reasons to begin disentangling the force until July, and the process is now only just completed. As a consequence the  2,000,000 which I took in the Army Estimates to provide for this withdrawal has been greatly exceeded, and the Government of India have notified me that their operations have involved an additional liability of over  3,000,000.* :&quot;. . . All these factors of uncertainty make it impossible t&apos;t estimate the men and money required for the discharge of these new liabilities in the Middle East with any approach to accuracy. But we have decided to take an optimistic view, and we have therefore made provision in the Estimates which involves during the new financial year, that is ro say, up to the .11st March, 1921 13 months from the present time  a reduction of these garrisons in the Middle likst to half their present strength within the time, and the termination of our financial burden in regard to Constantinople about half-way through the financial year.&quot; That is the provision which we have made. If events take a different and leas&apos; favourable turn, these -arrangements will have to be altered, and it will be necessary for me to come back to the House, lay the new situation before it, and ask the provision of the necessary additional credit.&quot; (Parliamentary Debates, 23rd February, 1920.)
In short, in all the theatres of the Middle East we estimated originally for an. expenditure of  42,000,000.   in the hope and intention of effecting reductions, I asked Parliament for . 33,000,000.    And in the upshot the cost is now estimated at , 49,000,000 for the financial year.   An addition of  16,000,000 over and above the money previously voted by Parliament is therefore required on this account.The second moft noteworthy cause of increase in expenditure arises from the dis-disturbed conditions in Ireland. Owing to the Irish situation and other dangers in other parts of the Empire, I have found it necessary to continue recruiting for the British Army, and we now have upon our strength 246,000 British troops as against 214,000 British troops which we expected to have at this period of the year. These numbers are fully covered by the Parliamentary sanction given to Vote A, but they involve an increased money provision. Additional expense has also been caused, by motor lorries, armoured cars and special measures to increase the well-being of the troops in the exceptional conditions of service in Ireland. Apart from the general increase in the total numbers of British troops which results from the disturbed state of the world, the extra cost of these special items attributable to Irish disturbances may be estimated at  1,500,000.As regards British troops generally, extra expense has been caused, not only by the increase in numbers, but also by a rise in prices since the Estimates were prepared, by additional railway charges and by increased expenditure on pensions and other non-effective services, due partly to the Pensions (Increases in) Act, 1920. The larger numbers, together with these other causes of variation, account for an increase of  10,750,000.There is an additional sum of  2,000,000 chargeable to Army Estimates in consequence of the decision to transfer to the War Office, as part of the process of winding up the Ministry of Munitions, certain National Factories which were created during the war, together with certain Inspection Departments.Everything else in the Supplementary Estimate now presented is due to charges arising out of the late war. As the various Departments concerned settle up the complicated accounts of the war period, large sums are charged to Army Estimates in payment for services rendered by those Departments during the war and during demobilization. For instance,  9,500,000 is charged by the Ministry of Shipping in respect of transports used in the war. This is  3,-750,000 more than I had been advised of by that Ministry when the Estimates were prepared. A charge -of  750,000 has fallen on Army Estimates in respect of a balance of pay of German prisoners of war employed in France ; I had hoped that this might have been set against our claims on Germany, but I am advised that according to the interpretation of the Treaty of Peace, this is not possible. A sum of  1,600,000 is claimed by India in respect of the locomotives which were taken from India during the war for service in East Africa and in Mesopotamia An arrear charge of about  700,000 from the East African Protectorate is expected to fall on the current years Army Estimates in respect of the expense of maintaining additional African troops ia the field during the war. The Assyrian and Chaldean refugees who have been encamped at Baqubah and in the Mosul Vilayet, since they were driven out of their country, and the Armenian refugees who are now gathered at Basra, have not yet been persuaded to return home, and many difficulties have obstructed their departure. In consequence, an additional charge ot  1,200,000 is expecti d to fall upon Army Votes. It has been arranged that any further charges which may arise from this cause after 31st March next shall be borne by Civil Votes.All the above charges taken together amount to a total of  .381- millions. Against this there are considerable savings on the ordinary administration of the British Army. The Territorial Army is now estimated to reach only half the figure that we hoped for during the present year, saving  1,650,000. In order not to interfere with the recruiting of this force, which is steadily going forward, I have postponed the special recruitment of the Army Reserve up to the figure shown in Army Estimates, saving  1,000,000. I have also postponed the formation of the Special Reserve or Militia, saving  2,000,000. These great diminutions of our pre-war reserve -strength make it all the more necessary that we should maintain an adequate number of soldiers serving with the Colours.An important windfall has also come to hand in the shape of an additional credit of  3,850,000 in respect of the difference, as now finally determined, between the actual cost of Government wool used fur Army purposes during the war and the price at which it is put into consumption by the Trade. Further, the increased cost of the garrisons in the Middle East would have been substantially higher but for the fall in the exchange value of the rupee.
In presenting a total net Supplementary Estimate of  29,750,000,1 have not taken any margin for unforeseen contingencies. I have already warned the House, however, that it is very difficult to estimate with certainty in times like these so long hefore the end of the financial year. Several important items enumerated above are, however, still in dispute and in suspense, and after careful consideration of the whole position I feel justified in balancing the prospects of reduction against the apprehension of future increase.I defer further exposition until the Supplementary Estimate is presented,WINSTON S.
