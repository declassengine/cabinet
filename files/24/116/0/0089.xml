This document is the property of HisJBritannic Majestys Government.   336SECRET. - ,    2CP. 2289. -THE CABINET.SUPPLY OP STORES TO POLAND AND GREECE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a memorandum prepared 0145 in the War Office on the supply of stores to Poland and Greece. 1071w. s. c.The&apos; War Office,-   Uth December, 1920.With reference to Cabinet 63 (20), at which it was decided that &apos;&quot; The Polish Government should be permitted to purchase spare British stores from- the British Government on the distinct understanding that the transaction is carried out on purely commercial lines, and that they pay cash . . . .&quot;The position is briefly as follows : The War Office are holding on Army charge the stores detailed in Appendix A, provisionally allocated as shown in that Appendix as between the Greeks and the Poles, which would otherwise have been thrown up as surplus. In addition, the Disposal Board were instructed to withhold from sale the stores shown in Appendix B already thrown up as surplus to them. The War Office are naturally anxious to get rid of the surplus stores now held by them, and so save the expense of storage. &amp;c. The Disposal Board are equally anxious to dispose of by sale as opportunity occurs the stores shown in Appendix B.The retention of these stores as earmarked for the Greeks and Poles has already involved the country in considerable expense, and cannot continue indefinitely.If Poland were alone affected, it would appear that the obvious solution, following the lines of the Cabinet decision quoted above, would be for the War Office to throw up all stores now held on account of Poland, to the Disposal Board, notifying them that so far as the War Office is concerned there is no objection to their disposing of either these stores, or those stores detailed in Appendix B, at the same time informing the Polish Government of the action taken, and suggesting to them that if they require any of these stores that they should negotiate with the Disposal Board for their purchase on an ordinary commercial basis. This would resolve the difficulty were it not that these stores are also affected by the requirements of the Greek Government, should the Cabinet decide that in the light of recent events there is any necessity to reserve stores for the requirements of the Greek Government,It is, therefore, suggested that (a.) In the event of the Cabinet deciding that there is no longer any necessity to reserve stores to meet the contingent requirements of the Greek Government, all the stores in question should be treated as proposed above, relatively to Poland, viz., thrown up for disposal, and both the Greeks and Poles allowed to negotiate for their * purchase on an ordinary commercial basis.(b.) In the event of the Cabinet deciding that stores should still be withheld from disposal on account of Greece, it is for decision whether (1.) Only those stores hitherto provisionally allocated to Greece, as shown inAppendix A, should be withheld from disposal; or, (2.) All the stores detailed in Appendices A and B should be so withheld.
