*   This Document is thn Property of ^t-v ^H^tcv-^f !    j/ljani)-3 r/]:i:        Cover, ::ont. ..sCirculated by the Secretary of State for India,   -&amp;S^^tl. (   0.P,   22 04 V ))I have read Mr. Hughes&apos; contribution to the study of the Egyptian question, fI most sincerely trust that the question will not be delayed until next year&apos;s Imperial Cabinet. I do not gather from Mr. Hughes&apos; telegram that lie proposes to make any real contribution to its study. I have, moreover, a lively recollection of Mr. Hughes&apos; contributions to the Treaty of Versailles, which, in that they delayed the conclusion of peace and the fixation of reparation at a reasonable figure, have been largely responsible for the present condition of Europe and the present uncertainties of British trade.But my excuse for intervention is Mr. Hughes&apos; characteristically iguorant remarks about India. Perhaps the Colonial Secretary will take some opportunity of pointing out to him that even the most convinced enemy of our policy with regard to India would admit that the very limited measure (noj^yetjn force) of association with the Government which we have given to Indians, and our conditional promise of self-government in the future, have ameliorated and not worsened the condition of that country,, where such disquieting features that exist are due entirely to the Treaty of Sevres and the regrettable extravagances as an outcome of shocking murders which occurred in the Punjab. Perhaps self-government is dangerous. I suppose that some time or other in history our Government gave it to Australia ; I suppose that the activities of her Prime Minister in European politics may be an unfortunate consequence of self-government. But we have not tried it yet in India; and when it.comes I do not suppose that the economic arguments of Indian leaders will be worse, or their carelessness as to facts more egregious, than in Australia.E.
