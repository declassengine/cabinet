Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State, dated27th November 1920.Following is weekly telegram.There is little to report, the situation is quieter and there is an improvement as regards schools, normal work expected to commence shortly in Islamia College, Lahore, and Khalsa College, Amritsar. Government decision to withdraw Government control from the latter having been well received. Malaviya has contradicted statement published in the Independent (Allahabad) of 21st, that Maharaja of Mysore, Chancellor of Hindu University, invited to come to Benares to handle the situation arising out of non-co-operation, he being in favour of it himself. States that he definitely wishes non-co-operation were at an end. C. R. Das, B. C. Pal, Lajpat Rai conferring with Malaviya at Benares. Great efforts made by non-co-operators to win over Benares students, Muhammad Ali asks for complete abandonment by them of studies in such institutions, and Moti Lai Nehru, addressing students, characterised non-co-operation movement as spiritual war, in which cause able bodied soldiers, and mentally equipped persons like students were required. National institutions established, meeting with little success. National College at Aligarh consists (? of) two bungalows, for which Khilafat Committee pays Rs. 600 a month. Admissions were 100, but only 50 students present, and only one lecture given so far. College at Ahmadabad similarly without sinews, but principles of its working announced with flourishing of trumpets. Patel has performed opening ceremony of National College at Surat. It is reported that College students from all over India intend to meet at.Nagpur just before National Congress to define their attitude towards questions of day.Course of non-co-operation continues same lines meetings adopting it, but few instances giving practical effect. Condemned by public meeting of Hindus and Mohamedans, Ghazipur, United Provinces, especially as regards students. Moslem Club, Ludhiana, unanimously and strongly condemned non-co-operation propaganda and resolved to issue pamphlet on subject to counteract mischief.Sastri has been lecturing in Madras on fallacies of non-co-operation, and his patient and steady work is calculated to diffuse common sense and reasonable attitude. At Allahabad deputation of non-co-operators pressed Chairman of Municipal Board to withdraw from candidature of Legislative Council. He stated he did not believe in movement and declined to withdraw. Gandhi had very poor reception at Jhansi where he was only able to collect less than Rs. 300.All-India Ulema conference held at Delhi 19th to 21st. First two, days of meeting not open to public, but 375 delegates present third day and many visitors. Gandhi and Ali brothers present. Resolutions adopted urging revival of Moslem fashion and dress, approving non-co-operation, condemning action of Trustees of Aligarh and other institutions, thanking students for embarking on non-co-operation, urging Hindu-Moslem unity, condemning repressive measures taken by authorities against Ulema and Khilafat workers, and advocating immediate establishment of Moslem treasury. We have received reports that meetings were not a success, and the intention to convert the conference into an all-India one failed. There was much acrimonious discussion as to co-operation with Hindus and as to attitude of Moslem element&apos; towards Gandhi. Resolutions were passed en bloc on the last day of conference chiefly for Press consumption. Delhi, Ajmer-Merwara Provincial Con-ference held 24th to 26th. Resolutions adopting non-co-operation, boycott of Municipal Commissioners of Delhi, who voted for address to His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught and those seeking election to Councils. Gandhi&apos;s reception was poor, and his efforts to influence Delhi students reported unsuccessful.Punjab Government issued communique that a few clerks and minor officials who resigned service to perform Hi j rat, should, as far as possible, be allowed to return to old posts, as far as this can be done without interfering with those who had received permanent promotion in their places. Absence may be condoned provided return within six months and satisfy Head of Office of repentance.Bombay have sanctioned prosecution of printer and publisher Al Wahid newspaper of Karachi under section 124a, Indian Penal Code, in respect of three articles, (1) conditions of Moslems and their fate, (2) protection of Khilafat, (3) question of Councils and titles to Mohamedans, in issues of 14th September, I8th September and 6th October last.Private information has been received that non-co-operation making no headway in Bengal. Generally speaking, it may be said that situation is easier and outlook improved, but much will depend on the decision reached at Nagpur Congress Meeting next month.2845     100  12.20
