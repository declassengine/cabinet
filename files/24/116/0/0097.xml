I. NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN UNITED KINGDOM ONDECEMBER 10, 1920.The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unem-ployment figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in .1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919, it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :  Per cent.To the end of January   ... ... ... ... ... ... 2-9February ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-6March     ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-1April       ... ... ... ... ... ... 0-9May        ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-1June        ... ... ...      ..... ... ... 12July        ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-4,   August    ... ... ... ... ... ... 1-6September ... ... ... ... ... ... 2-2October    ... ... ... ... ... 5-3Numbers on Registers of Employment Exchanges.	1920.								27th Aug.	24th Sept.	8th Oct.	15th Oct. -		12t,h Nov.	19th Nov.	26th Nov.Men  Civilians Ex-service Boys Women Girls	86, p6 142,600 17,608 58,982 17,480	73,644 178,488 16,226 61,149 17,135	82,609 186,711 17,004 68,922 18,034	85,451 190,136 17,135 74,416 18,216	-n -p w % o o	134,868 239,816 21,872 97,964 22,287	129,222 246,323 21,579 100,437 22,590	126,877 251,407 20,754 103,420 21,950Totals	818,096	346,642	373,280	385,354		516,757	520,151	524,408GENERAL.Unemployment is still increasing in London and in the industrial areas throughout the country generally. The position appears to be growing worse both in the cotton and woollen textile industries. Practically all woollen and worsted firms are now on short time varying from six hours to a maximum of three days per week. In the cotton industry all users of American cotton are reducing production by 50 per cent. The boot and shoe industry has reached a critical stage, and work-people hitherto on short time are now being dismissed and factories closed indefinitely. Depression continues in the hosiery, lace, and wholesale clothing industries. No improvement is reported in either the engineering or shipbuilding industries, and the strike of the ships&apos; joiners continues. In the iron and steel trades the position is slightly worse, and considerable slackness is reported in the Welsh tinplate industry. In coal-mining and pottery the situation is satisfactory.
II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for arterial roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.
