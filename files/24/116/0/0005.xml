IRAFT INSTRUCTIONS TO SIR JOHN BHAPHTBY. ^In accordance with the instructions of        Government a formal communication has already been addressed tc you inviting you to act as their representative at tho forthcoming Conference which is to be held at Brussels on the question of Reparation.In inviting you to undertake this work H,11.Government desire to recall to your mind the circumstances to which this Conference  *owes its origin and the general purpose for which it is summoned.It will be within your recollection that at the Conference of Ministers which was held at Boulogne in June last a scheme was adopted, the main feature of which was that the Reparation to be paid by the German Government should take the form of annuities spread over a specified number of years,, power being reserved t.Q the German Government to discount them at specified rates and to the   Reparation Commission to postpone but not to remit the pay-ment of part of them.    It was also agreed by the Ministers of the Allied Powers at that Conference that this scheme should.be the basis of a reply to the German Government in the event of the l,atl&apos;m.\. failing to submit to the Allies satisfactory proposals for the fu.1- . fulfilment of their obligations in the matter of reparation.It will also- be within your memory that it was not found possible to adopt this course at the subsequent Conference which was held at Spa in July,    It wrs in these circumstances that H. Delacroix, the Chairman of the Conference, proposed at the meeting on the l6th July that the question of reparation should be consider--ed in the first instance by a special Commission which should be composed of two delegates from each delegation and should meet at an early date in order to exchange views and explore the whole position with a view to presenting a report to the Spa Conference. The proposal put forward by M. Delacroix was accepted by the representatives both of the allied Powers and the German Government and it is in order that effect may be -*iven to the intentions of the Spa Conference in this matter &quot;that it has now been decided
