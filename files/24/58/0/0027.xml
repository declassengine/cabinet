SECRETl&apos;,S.K,43^ cab//v(This Document Is the Property 01 HIS Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Oovermrient)Till. 171-&apos; F0* I:.R SITU/TIOK&apos; S1.C0KD H/LF OF 1918 eiiiorrndum by the &apos; lnister oi ]\!.;tlonrl Service.Tho incr-erc-in-- difficulties of the &quot;Vn Power situr-tion compel me r-rin to ask the   ar Cabinet for decisions on matters vitally affectin&quot; the war effort.Since 1st January 1916 the &quot; inistry of Frtional Servir has raised over 450,000 men for the /rmed Forces (see /ppendix 1 The vast majority of the recruits ore younj? men of excellent physique.   Notwithstanding the substantial measure of success which has attended the recruitinr effort nervy unsatisfied demands remain;&apos;The /dmiralty is owed 37,500 men to complete its original demand for 1918.The /rmy Council hove asked.for 551,000 recruits in the two months. 1st July-31st /ugust.     Further demands for the later months of the year are foreshadowed.The ;ir   inistry ask for 196,000 men (including /viation Candidates) in the period 1st July, 1918-31st Fay,1919.(For details of demands see /ppendix 2* )-These demands cannot be met in full.     i estimate that the total recruitment for 1918 cannot much exceed 700,000 men in all without shattering industry and severely crippling our whole war effort   (For details of recruiting forecast 1st July-31st December, 1918 see /ppendix 3).     I believe that with the cooperation of the Supply Departments it will be possible to approach, possibly to reach, that firrure without creating such disturbance in industry as will seriously diminish essen-tial production. &apos; It will not however remain possible to expand output in any direction without arranging for an equivalent contraction in another without checking recruiting.In these circumstances I surest that the &apos;&quot;ar Cabinet decide1.     That the Ministry of National Service, should work to a total recruitment in 1918 of approximately 700,000 men,2.     That all Departments of State be forbidden to arrange for increased output in any direction without arranging for an equivalent contraction in another pert of their own or some other Department^ programme.If 1. be not approved, at what figure is the Ministry of National Service t* aim?If 2. be not approved, what prlcedure is to be adopted for preventing an increase in the total output aimed at?Finally with regard to the distribution of recruits between the Forces, is the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Kan Power that &quot;the fightinp: personnel requlre-ments of the Royal Navy and of the /ir Services should have absolute priority ever all other Services&quot; to continue in force and to be applied in meeting the requirements of the Navy, and the Pir Force as set out in /ppendix 2?16/7/18p, Cc GEDDES.
