tyM I. Mlj Joes.     12gIffIB DOCUMENT IS THE? BKOffERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC, MAJESTY1a . qOVBB3j0jaBMg&apos;l i.SecretWAR OABHOBT. Allowances to the Parents... of Unmarried Apprentices, Students, and Youths on progressive wages.,Note by the Minister of Pensions,(See G. 217 &amp; G. 217a)The basis on. which the present claim on behalf of parents of unmarried sons is founded is that the State, in granting separ-atJon allowance to dependantSj takes no account of the circumstances of the family but issues allowances automatically in any case where it is shown that the amount, contributed by the son to the home before his enlistment is in excess of the cost of his keep.This naturally creates a grievance in two classes of cases : * - - - - -(a) $he parents who have made sacrifices to provide training or apprenticeship for their son(b) The parents whose son enlisted early in the war before he had reached his full, earning capacity or had obtained the benefit of the increase in wages.In (a) the sonf whilst training, ja unable to contribute and no separation allowance is, therefore, paidtIn (b) the contribution and consequently the separation allowance is less than it would have been if enlistment had been delayed.Tfte State having admitted the right of a parent to sep-aration allowance on what is frequently only a theoretical depen-denee it is impossible to meet the complaint that the parents who havfi made sacrifices for the future of their son, or whose son has pattiotically joined the Forces before receiving full wages, is unfairly treated.., This complaint has for a long time been pressed in the House of Commons and was raised recently both on the Vote of Credit and the Ministry of Pensions Vote.    Although no pledge was made the promise of &quot;consideration^ gave rise to the impression that the grievance would be remedied.In my view the general complaint can only be met by a flat-rate provision,, firstly because the claim is for automatic allowances administered in the same way as the existing separation allowance to dependants, that is, without any condition that the allowance must be shown to be necessary for the upkeep of the home as is. the base.under the Special $rants Committee^ Regulations, and secondly.because the /
machinery of the Local War Pensions Committees was nerer intended for wholesale payments and is entirely inadequate for the purpose.I agree that esses which would not be met by the flat rate should be dealt with by the Special Grants Committee under this regulation extended so as to include the ^progressive wage earner as well as apprentices and students.The objeotions to the proposed flat-rate of 3/6 are:-1.   That it is too low as compared with the average dependants&apos; separation allowance.which is now etated to be approximately 8/- a week, and consequently will not satisfy either the parents themselves or the members of Parliament who are fighting for their cause.The payment of a sum of 6d a day to the dependants of men in the Forces has been held up to derision in the House in connection with pensions.2.   That from the point of view of machinery, it has the double disadvantage Of placing upon the Pay.Offices the strain of a new flat rate, and overwhelming the Special Grants Committeo and Local War Pensions Committees with demands for supplementary allowances under the proposed extension of thej,r powers, many of which would not arise were the flat rate fixed at a more adequate figure.In my opinion a flat rate of 5/- together with supplementary allowances in exceptional cases, would be an infinitely better solution.My reasons for suggesting 5/-, and not tho average amount, which is 8/- are:-(a) where the family circumstances are such that a contribution would not be essential, it is right to assume that the son would not do more than pay  1 a week into the household, of which 5/- may be regarded as profit under the present conditions.(b) that in view of the impossibility of administ&amp;JJt^ discretionary allowances on a general scale, the flat rate should be fixed at a figure which will satisfy the majority of claims.(InteU)   J.H.Ministry of Pensions. 18th July, 1918.
