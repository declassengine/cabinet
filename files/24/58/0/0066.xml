Dear Mr.. Lloyd George, ;    tI. understand that Mr. Barnes has been speaking to you regarding our request for the appointment of a Royal Commission on Finance, and that my previous letter has been lost sight of&quot;.See On the 16th January I wrote as follows:- ^r.3392. . ,  -.; &quot;The Labour Party at its -meeting this afternD.cn deoided to put forward a request for the appointment of a Royal Commission for the purpose of securing reliable iriforma-tion of a detailed character as to the national wealth and also as to the liabilities of the nation,&quot;.&quot;The Party is strongly of opinion that such an Inquiry-is very necessary at the present time and that a Royal Corn-mission would be the best body to conduct it.   At the same time, however, in suggesting a Royal Commission the Party, does not wish to imply that the Inquiry would be very protracted; indeed it feels that the Inquiry should be carried out as expeditiously as possible, and the Report presented without delay in order that the.Government may, if it is considered desirable, take prompt, action upon it.&quot;I believe there is some doubt as to the-form we think the Inquiry should, take^ and I would suggest some such -    terms of reference as the following:-To inquire into the present financial position of . the country and the international financial position created by the war debts of the belligerent nations&apos;, to consider and report upon the methods adopted for financing the War; the methods to be adopted for dealing with the :i     -liquidation of the National .Debt; the system and incidence of taxation for liquidating the Debt and for making the annual charge thereon;, the/National Wealth available for such purposes; and. to consider the Banking system.of the &apos;        country in connection with the promotion of State Loans.T shall &quot;fee glad if you will give the matter as early ^onsideration  as your, heavy duties will permit,&apos; &apos; . Yours sincerely,(Sd.)
