/i this ix?cmT rs to property of his brit aitoq majesty:^ goymmt)yAR   CABINETIV( SEE, fit, let&amp;gr from ^J^a^i^Q^h^ Prime Minister)(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister)Ministry of Shipping,St. James&apos;5 Park, S     1.15th July 1918.Dear Prime Minister,I hear it reported that the Pood people are purposing to improve the quality of bread now biing used in this country. I Would like to suggest to you that further consideration be given to this before any decision is taken as it will mean increased import.   I just have the fear that the heavy imports and large stocks are encouraging the Food Department to think that there is ample material and that this can safely be done.. I would like to remind you that the lately increased imports have been done at great cost to the country.   It has been necessary to practically starve the Colonies arid a number of trades in the way of tonnage, and what I suggest is that we want to give greater consideration to imports for manufacturing purposes as it is to be feared we shall be left with no export trades when the war is over if the present position continues,America is working hard to take up many of our trades and so also is Japan.This brings up also the question of manufacturing material such as clothing and blankets for the American Army.It seems to me a Most questionable policy to stop our export trade even for the sake of exchange, in favour of helping the Americans, while the Americans use their material to a greater extent for export purposes, which they send to markets from which our merchants are being driven.Further, I would remind you that the bread in France is not to compare with our bread in England today, and if the French find that we are using better bread, we shall have another cry for additional imports for France.I know the argument about feeding stuffs but investigation is required from a tonnage point of view.Yours faithfully,(aigned)   J , MACLAY.
