Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 17th, July, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week In furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

COMPULSORY TILLAGE - LAND INSPECTION.

The full staff of Inspectors are now engaged on the work of inspecting holdings throughout the country for the purpose of determining the arable acreage, etc., and of reporting cases of default in complying with the Tillage Orders.

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

One hundred and fifty five applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£50,260.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

The ?ong spell of dry parching weather came to an end at the beginning of the week, since which time a good deal of rain has fallen. This change, although unfavourable from the point of view of those engaged in hay-making has been most welcome in other respects and has already exercised a very beneficial effect on growing crops. The benefit resulting from these rains has been particularly noticeable in the case of root crops, cereals and grass.  It is a long time since pastures in all parts of the country have been so bare as they were just before this change came, and already the improvement in the condition of grass lands is very striking. Atmospheric conditions, marked as they were in many districts by thunder storms and the close, damp weather incidental thereto, were favourable to the development of potato blight, but so far this disease has not spread to any serious extent, Spraying is in progress everywhere, and reports regarding the condition of the potato crop indicate a much better promise than was expected a few weeks ago.

HARVESTING OF CROPS.

In connection with the increased amount of machinery coming into use, the Department have arranged to provide a series of demonstrations in the working of binders, ? and other machinery for their Agricultural Instructors and Overseers, in order that they may be in a better position to assist farmers during the pressure of 17/7/18
the harvest. The first batch of Instructors will attend for these demonstrations at one of the Department&apos;s Agricultural Stations on the 29th instant.

FLAX.

Compulsory Saving of Flaxseed.

Thirty seven temporary Inspectors have, to date, been offered appointments for the purpose of assisting in the promulgation and enforcement of the Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918, and 26 have accepted appointment.

The Inspector General, Royal Irish Constabulary, at the request of the Department, has had instructions issued to the Constabulary to take energetic steps to see that the Order is complied with.

TRANSIT OF FARMING REQUISITES.

The Department&apos;s Transit Branch dealt, during the week, with representations regarding the conveyance of consignments of agricultural requirements, such as, plough parts, mowers, hay machines, corn drills, and milling machinery. Inquiries were again made at a number of centres throughout the country relative to the transit of farming requisites.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 9th to 15th instant, inclusive, 297 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding sows were received and 276 licences were issued. During the same period 78 applications for licences to export milch cows, 134 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers and 32 applications for licences to export store heifers and strippers, were received. Twenty-six applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were also received.

An Order has been issued removing, from the 15th instant, the restrictions on the shipment of cows giving milk, except as regards ? in-calf animals. This decision was taken in view of the fact that the supplies of milk in the country appear to be adequate at present, and that the main necessity is to see that farmers are afforded adequate inducements to keep up the stocks of in-calf heifers and cows.
