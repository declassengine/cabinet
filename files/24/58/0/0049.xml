MOBILIZATION OF GREECE.  . (Memorandum &quot;by Secretary of State for War.)I wish to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the need Of expediting the procedure by which the fulfilment of our undertaking to equip the Greek Army is being carried out.The situation with regard to this matter is as follows.     The general promise to furnish the assistance required to enable the Greek Army to mobilise was supplemented by a definite ruling by General Smuts on behalf of the War Cabinet on 29th April (G.T.4362) and this ruling with some further slight modifications was embodied in a convention between the Governments concerned which was finally signed on 1st June.   The terms of the Convention were, of course, carefully scrutinised by the Treasury as well as by the War Office.   The actual Greek demands are moreover checked and approved of by the British Representative on the Inter-Allied Commission at Athens (General Reade) before any action is taken by the War Office,   Under the present procedure, however, before any of the equipment in question can be actually sent out the War Office has again to apply with regard to each specific item for prior sanction from the Treasury through the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, and this leads to further questioning and serious delays.A considerable portion of the goods required has already been despatched, in some cases under emergency certificates issued by General Callwell, the War Office representative on these questions, the issue of which has since been questioned by tho Treasury.   But the autumn is rapidly approaching, and it is essential that the still outstanding balance of the articles promised to greece, including more particularly some 475,000 yards of thick cloth for overcoats, with which the Greek troops are at present wholly unprovided, should be despatched by the middle of August.Under the circiostances I should be glad to have a general ruling from the War Cabinet directing the War Office, the Treasury and the C.I.R.. to meet without&apos; question all demands for equipment from this country that may   be put forward by General Reade, provided that the material is available, and more particularly a ruling that, till the Greek mobilisation ha3 been completed, prior Treasury sanction should be waived, all issues for this purpose regarded as emergency issues, and the C.I.R., instructed to take immediate action on receipt of a certificate from the War Office.18th July, 1918.mil2co.
