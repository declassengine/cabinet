Several visits have been paid to Liverpool by the Directed of Movements,   A Brigadier-General is in charge of the entraining arrangements after the reception of the troops by American Officers, and although there have been a great many difficulties to overcome in consequence of the large numbers arriving by convoy,the Officer Commanding the American troops has expressed his great satisfaction at the working out of the details as settled with him.Some time ago steps were taken by the War Office to provide bands both at Southampton and at Liverpool, and the information received particularly from Southampton goes to show that the American Authorities and soldiers greatly appreciate the efforts made to give them a hearty reception.    The Civic Authorities have also been approached and have been rendering most useful service in this direction.   But at Liverpool particularly it is often difficult to notify the Civil Authorities of the arrival of American troops, and even when they are so notified circumstances may make it impossible for them to give such a Civic reception as they might desire to give.   The details of a convoy of U.S.A. troops disembarked at Liverpool on the 23rd -28tii June will illustrate this.   After disembarkation and before entraining the men are paraded and a copy of the King&apos;s letter of welcome is presented to each man.Convoy arrived.........   23rd/24th June, 1918,No. of vessels .........14Ho. of Troops carried,. ..   25,000 all ranks.The troops were disembarked at the following points:-Landing Stage Canada Dock Huskieson Dock Sandon Dock Queen &apos;s Dock Brocklebank DockHarrington Dock. \The following stations were used for the entrainment of the troops:-Central
Central Station Riverside Station Huskiseon Station Bankfieldi JStation Exchange Station Langdon Station Walton-on-the-Hi 11 Bootle -Stanley Knotty-&apos; Ash,In all 52 trains were employed to convey the troops to their destinations.On this day three hands were in attendance and were u&amp;ed at as many entraining stations as possible to play the troops in,Mr. Ben Tillett who sent a telegram to the Prime. Minister, complaining of the reception given to U,S.A* troops a.t Liverpool, has been seen by the Under Secretary of State for War.     When he sent this telegram he happened to be in Liverpool when this particular Convoy arrived.     The difficulties of the situation were explained to hin and he was satisfied that the Government has every intention to give the troops as hearty a welcome as possible.     Sir Watson Rutherford, M.P. one of the oldest Members for Liverpool, has also been seen by the Under Secretary of State,     Sir Watson agreed that everything that was ipossible was being done at Liverpool, but he has promised to find out what possibly can be done further there.    Here two things might be suggested:-Firstly:   Arrangements ,,might be made to supply refreshments to the troops at some point on their railway journey.     The difficulty here of course is that they may arrive at that point at odd times or in the dead of night; but it could be I think arranged to forewarn say the local Y.M.CA. people or the Civic Authorities, who Would I have no doubt be delighted to prepare and to serve refreshments to -them.Secondly:    It might be possible to grant the same facilities for railway travel on leave to American troops as are given to our own soldiers. . This would have to be considered by the President of the Board of Trade, who might feel that an undue strain might thus be placed upon an attenuated railway service.The Minister of Information has appointed Colonel Sir Randolph Baker, M.P, as Chairman of the American Entertainments Committee;   he is in close touch with the War Office and with .the Americar. Authorities.   Excellent work is being done by the provision of concerts and othe$. entertainments.     Every Sunday evening for example at the -Palace Theatre an entertainment is given by the best-known s Music Hall Artistes and a Member of the Government delivers&apos; an address of welcome.    General Biddell was there last Sunday evening and he expressed to the Under Secretary of State his great appreciation of the efforts which were put forward to welcome his troops.20th July, 1918,MILNER.
