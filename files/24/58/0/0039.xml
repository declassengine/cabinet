Germany/009.MEMORANDUMONTHE SITUATION IN GERMANY.THE best account of the political situation since Herr von Kuhlmann&apos;s speeches of the 24th and 25th June is contained in a leading article in the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung &quot; of the 27th June (No. 176, evening edition). As the article has nowhere been adequately reproduced it may be worth while to give the following account of it with extracts: The article begins by saying that the debate in which the speeches of Kiihlmann and of the Imperial Chancellor were delivered in no wise cleared up the situation. The Conservative leader, Count Westarp, drew from the debate the conclusion : &quot; the Imperial Chancellor cannot and will not pursue the policy of the Peace Resolution (of July 1917) as we understand it.&quot; The Social Democrat, Noske, on the contrary, gathered from what the Chancellor said that he advocated a peace by understanding. In a word, the whole situation continues as it was; the Chancellor remains in an atmosphere of semi-obscurity ; and his statements equally permit the Majority and the Minority to regard him as an advocate of the objects which they have in view. This situation cannot be regarded as favourable for Germanys foreign policy ; a policy, the outlines of which are so undetermined, is bound to be regarded as either weak or as intentionally ambiguous, or as both ; and, as a matter of fact, this view of Germany&apos;s policy has been assiduously disseminated abroad.Dealing with what it calls the &quot; Kuhlmann crisis,&quot; the &quot; Frankfurter &quot; goes on to point out that the explanations of Kuhlmann&apos;s speech of the 24th June, which the Chancellor and the Secretary ol State gave on the 25th June, did not indeed withdraw Kuhlmann&apos;s pronouncement in favour of peace by understanding, but they nevertheless left the impression that the Government had a sense of weakness in confronting the influences which are behind the attacks of the annexationist spokesmen (the Conservative leader, Westarp, and the National Liberal leader, Stresemann) and a. desire to placate them.Here follows an amazing disclosure with regard to the action of the Military Censorship : &quot;The (Socialist) deputy, Noske, established the fact that the Military Censor-ship had likewise interfered with the discussion of the speech of the Secretary of State and had forbidden the interpretation of it to be disseminated, that a military decision would not end the war. &apos; The Chief Command of the Army believes in victory and any other interpretation is forbidden.&apos; The fact that the Military Censorship in agreement with the Chief Command of the Army embraces in its activity the speeches and declarations of responsible statesmen, and prescribes how this or that turn of expression is to be interpreted, really represents the &apos; limit&apos; (&apos; hbchste Steigerung &apos;) in this sphere. So far as we know, things have never gone so far as that the representatives of the military authorities should issue verdicts upon the utterances of those whose business it is to conduct the government of the country, and that they should try to prevent the public from adopting particular views of responsible statesmen. This is going pretty far, but it is characteristic of the situation. The question is whether this situation has Under-gone any change as the result of the Reichstag debates and with respect to the issue of the crisis. We do not think that it has. True, the Majority parties have ranged themselves with welcome unanimity behind the Secretary of State, who was attacked, and the Government also appears .... to have identified itself with Herr von Kuhlmann. If it was the intention of the Pan-German Minority to overthrow the Secretary of State, it may be that they have not on this occasion attained their object; in so far as they are the exponents of influences outside Parliament, their defeat would likewise affect these influences. But does this really amount to a victory of the Reichstag Majority, and is it not, on the contrary, a great mistake to believe that that Majority can celebrate a triumph ? The fact remains that the Chancellor and also the Secretary of State himself hastened to[367-26]
weaken, so far as they could, the impression made by Kuhlmann&apos;s speech; and is this not a success scored by those factors outside Parliament, a success compared with which Kuhlmann&apos;s departure or his continuance in office is a matter of secondary importance 1 If these factors, the most important of which is the Chief Command of the Army, as was shown by previous crises and has again been demonstrated by these debates, are at all times able to transform those views of the leading statesmen which are disagreeable to them; if they eati forbid the public to give their assent to such views and can make those who express them ; pologise, then it does not really much matter who the persons are who conduct public business and who figure as the representatives of German policy before the Reichstag. Political government is then, in fact, a mere show; in reality it is the minority of the representatives of the people who rule, because that minority is able to point to its agreement with those who are in command of the army.&quot;The article goes on to deal with the dissension between the military and the political influences, its nature and its consequences.&quot; The real centre of the storm, which perhaps for the present is over, but which may break out afresh in the near future, lies outside the Reichstag. The dualism of the political and military control of affairs which is making itself powerfully felt is nothing new. We have had it for more than a century. Frederick the Great was Commander and statesman in one. But as far back as the Wars of Liberation we find a keen jealousy between the leaders of the Army and the statesmen; and in the wars which were fought to secure the unification of Germany these frictions and obstructions became still more marked. If in that period the influence of the soldiers was reduced to its proper limits though there was no lack of attempts to extend it the reason was that the conduct of policy was in the hands of a statesman of the size of Bismarck and that he knew himself to be in absolute possession of the confidence of King William I.* The circumstances to-day are in many respects different, and it is intelligible that, since there is a want of strong personalities in politics and since our Armies have accomplished such mighty achievements, the military leaders should now play a more prominent part than was the case in former times. The relationship between the political chiefs and the military has taken such a form in the world-war that Clausewitz&apos;s principle, according to which the Army should be the instrument of policy, can hardly now be maintained in its original sense. The relations have now become such that the partner who directs and decides is the Chief Command of the. Army. It shows our war policy the paths in which it is to go, fixes its objects and lays down limits which may not be exceeded. This has repeatedly been pointed out in the Reichstag and it has just been pointed out once more, but we cannot say that anything has been done to place the relationship upon its former footing. Perhaps that is not possible. In that case we should think it better to draw the inferences from the facts and not to be content with appearances which involve a great self-deception.&quot; There are two possible courses which would replace the present uncertainty by a real solution. Either the Chancellor should once more formally declare in the name of the Government that the Government is still prepared to put an end to the war by an understanding which would meet our vital necessities; or else the representative of those influences, the exponents of which in the Reichstag assert that the Government will not and cannot pursue the policy of understanding, should themselves assume responsibility for Germany&apos;s policy. If it is the case that the Chief Command of the army determines the course of our policy, then the natural solution is that the conduct of this&apos;policy should quite frankly be taken over by someone who belongs to that school of thought. A state of things in which quite contradictory conceptions of the Governments political aims are entertained on the Right and the Left of the House.must in the long run prove intolerable. The majority of the Reichstag must most emphatically insist upon the situation being cleared up. If neither the one thing nor the other is done, and if the present misconception continues, we shall perhaps in a very short time be confronted with fresh crises. Preparations for peace cannot be promoted, they can only be rendered more difficult by such half-measures.&quot;* As a matter of fact Bismarck had constantly great difficulties in retaining the confidence of William I against the efforts of the Generals and others to influence the Sovereign.
