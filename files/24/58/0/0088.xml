A perusal of the article will show that it contained no suggestion that the British Infantry in France only numbered 350,000 or that any statement of figures should be published as regards the infantry alone or that the German Intelligence Department should be provided with inform-ation as to the total number of our troops In franco.    The statement as to rifle strength was expressly quoted as a &quot;silly&quot; Gorman statement put about by German agents in France for the purpose of making bad blood between Britain end France; and the article specifically said, as to this and other mischievous rumours, that they could be rationally answered, and that they had been an3wored &quot;so far as the Military necessity for secrecy permitted&quot;.The article was writien expressly for the propaganda purposes of this Ministry,     It was signed solely because Lir. Arnold Bennett1s namg is one of the most influential names in journalism today.    It has had a very great success, both in England and in francs; and many evidences have been reoeived from officials and citizens of both countries ae to its perfect effectiveness.     In America the article was given the widest possible publicity.The article has my complete approval, and I have expressed that approval without any reserve to ilr. Arnold Bennett, who, in my opinion has been guilty of no indiscretion whatsoever.Yours faithfully,(Signed). BEAVERBROOIC.he Secretary, v/ar Cabinet,2, *%itohall Gardens,
