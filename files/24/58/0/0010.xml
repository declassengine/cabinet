CHURCHILL,I-STRIKES.Statistics of Strikes in June.The following table shows for the month of June the number of persons involved in strikes in each district, the total number of days lost, and the average duration of the strikes : Tlistri ot	Number of Work-	Number of Days	Average Duration of	people involved.	lost.

The reduction in time worked during June owing to strikes was 0&apos;19 per cent.-1 day in 526 as compared with 0&apos;09 per cent. 1 day in 1,112 in May.Causes of Strikes in June. *Out of 47 stoppages during the month, 21 were occasioned by disputes as to wages including demands for an advance or bonus, questions of piece-work, the terms of arbitration awards, and methods of payment. Six stoppages were due to dismissals, three to grievances against superintendents and foremen, and seven to the employment of aliens, non-unionists or diluted labour. In three cases the disputes were over questions of demarcation, in one case shortage of material was alleged, and in one the stoppage was a protest against recruiting. Two strikes took place for the recognition of shop committees, and one for the recognition of a union. One stoppage was for reduction in hours of labour, and one because the firm refused to give workpeople a break of 10 minutes in the morning for tea.Statistics of Strikes for six Months [January to June 1918).The following table shows the number of clays lost in each of the last six months (January to June), together with the percentage of possible working time* This figure does not include time lost through stoppage of overtime by the ironnloulders in Scotland,, and by employees of the Patent Shaft and Axletree Co., Ltd., Wednesbury. u  (33)G1G0  Pk 20  125  7/18   E &amp; S!

The most important stoppages were at No. 1 Aircraft Factory, -Whaddon, where 2,000 workpeople were on strike for one and a half days, and at the works of the Alliance Aeroplane Co., Ltd., Hammersmith, where 3,500 days were lost.Time lost and regained.A calculation has been made comparing the time lost in a year through strikes with the time gained by the sacrifice of holidays at Easter.In the twelve months ending June 1918, the number of working days lost through strikes on Ministry of Munitions work was 1,610,000. The number of persons engaged on Ministry of Munitions work is roughly 2,600,000. If, therefore, only one-third of them responded to the special appeal to wrork through the Easter holidays, they not only made good the whole of the time lost during the year, but were a million days to the good.London Aircraft Workers.The aircraft dispute which originated in the Alliance Aeroplane Company&apos;s works and, spreading, eventually involved practically all the aircraft workers in London, was brought to an end on the 10th inst. The parties had arrived at a deadlock. The men refused to resume work unless Hock, the shop steward whose dismissal was one of the casus belli, was reinstated pending an inquiry. The firm on their side refused to entertain this proposal. In order to terminate a situation which was disastrous to output and had become incapable of a normal solution, the Minister decided to take over the factory in which the dispute began, Rock&apos;s continued, employment to depend upon the result of an [inquiry to be instituted by the Ministy of Labour. The principal grievance alleged by the original strikers was the non-recognition by the firm of a shop committee. The dispute therefore had much in common with the prolonged struggle which took place last year in the engineering trades and which in December resulted in an agreement regulating, so far as the engineering trades were concerned, the appointment and functions of shop steward.Coke Oven and Bye-product Workers.As the result of a series of conferences, this dispute, particulars of which were given in last week&apos;s Report, has now been settled in accordance with the decision of the &quot;War Cabinet on the following terms : 1. The men are to be paid time and a half instead of time and a quarter-their present rate for the three Sunday shifts.2. The Coal Controllers war wage is to be paid per shift instead of per day.II.-RECKUITING AND DILUTION.The flow of skilled men into the army increases and is causing many anxious reflections on the subject of output. It is not only due to general recruiting and the comb-out; by a sort of irony the very production of aeroplanes, guns and weapons of precision, makes for reduced numbers in those engaged on their manufacture, since
&apos;% tf26their multiplication-enlarges the&quot;need&apos; of tlie army itself for1 skilled&apos;&apos;mieJn&apos;.&apos;vtte&apos; demand for skilled labour on important munition work is not much less than twice what it was eight or nine months ago. It is questionable whether it will be possible to maintain output at the level desired by the army and at the same time to maintain the army at its full strength, if to that end any further large contribution of men from munition works is necessary.The only factors compensating for loss by recruiting are dilution and training; the number of skilled men, even of low categories, who are being released from the colours to munition firms is now negligible. The training centres of the Ministry are doing much good and useful work, but they turn out a few hundreds where many . thousands of workers are needed, and the trainees, about 75 per cent, of whom are women, are of widely varying quality, ranging from a small minority useful in the tool-room to those of service in turning out ribs for aeroplanes. The main compensation is dilution, and theoretically, the limit of dilution has not been reached. Whether it ever can be reached is problematical. It is not only that difficulties increase as the process attains its later stages. The stubborn opposition of a strong trade union is in itself sufficient, in the area in which it is active, to prevent dilution almost entirely. In the wiredrawing industry, for example, trade union resistance in union factories has practically sterilised opportunity. This case is exceptional, but in most industries labour opinion is roused against further dilution at a point well below that which is possible in theory, and there is no doubt that opposition is being strengthened by the fear of recruiting.It is worthy of note that the emphasis laid in speeches and articles on the rapidity with which American troops are pouring into France renders it constantly more difficult to convince employers as well as workmen that any need exists for drastic recruiting and consequent dilution. It is known, for example, that compara-tively few men enrolled themselves as War Munition Volunteers under the recent scheme, but, as Mr. Barnes pointed out to the Trade Union Advisory Committee, the enrolments considered in the light of the rapid growth of American forces in Europe, were sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the suspension, at any rate temporarily, of the more unpopular portions of the Governments policy. From such facts as these, inferences are being drawn in the country which constitute a substantial addition to the difficulties in the way of more perfect dilution.
