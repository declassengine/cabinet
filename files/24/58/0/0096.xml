General Belfield states that certain important points arise whioh should be carefully considered by the War Office and Admiralty before the Agreement is discussed by the Imperial V/ar Cabinet. The full text of the Agreement is being printed for the Prisoners of Y.ar Department at the Foreign Office and it is hoped that copies will be available for circulation in two or three days1 time.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. 24th July. 1918.SUM&amp;aRY Off THE AGREEMENT SIGNED AT THE HAGUE onTthe 14th JULY; 1918.The main provisions of the above agreement are the followingCombatants.All non-commissioned officers and men who have been prisoners of war for over 18 months, with the exception of submarine crews, who are to be interned in Holland, are re-pat riated head for head.All officers now in the power of the enemy who have been prisoners of war for over 18 months are interned in either Holland or Switzerland.Combatants of all ranks, as well as civilians, now interned in Holland and Switzerland, are repatriated.Invalid combatants remain eligible for repatriation or for internment in a neutral oountry as hitherto.Civilians.All civilians, regardless of age or sex, who nro in the(Signed).

- 2power of the other party in any territory are repatriated, if they so desii-e, each Government reserving the right to detain&apos;a limited number of persons.Officers and men of the British Mercantile IJSarino are classed as civilians.The discrepancy between the number of valid male British and German civilians is dealt with as followsIt is estimated that about  0,000 male German civilians will desire to bo repatriated, and the German Government undertake,; in exchange for that, or for a less number, to repatriate 10,820 valid British males, consisting of 6,000 civilians and 4,-880 combatants of all ranks..    The latter figure represents the surplus of British officers now in Holland (320): the surplus of non-commissioned officers also interned there (2,200) and 2,300 combatants of all ranks, including those interned at Groningen.     Should the British civilians not roach a total of 6;000, the number will be made up by valid combatants,, and if the German civilians repatriated exceed 20,000,. one British combatant will be exchanged for every three Germans over that number..Repatriated combatants cannot be employed on naval or military service outside the territories of the British and &quot;German Empires respectively,,.Repatriated civilians cannot be employed in any naval or military service.Combatants and civilians will be conveyed to and from Great Britain in the same manner as hitherto.Germans in the Oversea Dominions will be repatriated by means of four German steamers whi^hare to be sold to the Motherland Government for tho period of the war.    These steamers will be commanded and mannod by the Dutch, will be distinctively marked, and will follow courses prescribed by the British Admiralty,    They will be examined on each outward and homeward voyage at British ports,     A proportion of places on each boat will be reserved for British civilians who desire to avail themselves of them.    Details concerning tbe voyages of these ships will be settled by a Commission at The Hague, consisting of one British, one Gorman and one Dutch representative.In view of the request of the Netherland Government combatants and civilians now interned in Holland will be repatriated first.METHODS   OF   TRANSPORT.ORDER   Og   REPATRIATION,Secondly
