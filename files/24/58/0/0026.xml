( JVtolTERBANEAN DISTRICT )OF--April , 1318 *ROYAL AIR FORGE HEADQUARTERS, (Mediterranean District), MALTA.
MEDITERRANEAN DISTRICT.GENERAL.The weather conditions during the periods covered by this report have on the whole been unfavourable for flying, the actual number of days, however, on which flying has not taken place is comparatively small, and usual anti-submarine patrols have been carried out. The importance of patrols at dusk and dawn has been fully established, and as far as possible such patrols are carried out by all groups.Two enemy submarines and two mines have been detected, and two submarines attacked. Detailed accounts of. these incidents appear in the reports on the Air Force Groups concerned.Statistical tables of anti-submarine patrol and escort work carried out are shewn at the end of Section 1.Very successful reconnaissance flights have been carried out from the /Egean and Adriatic Groups, reports of which will be found in Section 2 of this report.An abnormal number of Short Seaplanes in the various groups have been out of action through engine trouble with the 320 and 260 H.P. Sunbeam engines, principally the latter. This has to a great extent curtailed the amount of patrol work possible.SEAPLANE CARRIERS.A general re-distribution of the Seaplane Carriers attached to the Mediterranean Force is now under consideration, and final decisions will be promulgated in the Report for May.IT.M.S. &quot; Riviera &quot; arrived at Gibraltar on 24th April with aircraft for iEgean and Adriatic Groups.KITE BALLOONS.Up to the&apos; present no Kite Balloon operations have taken place. The work of completing the stations, and fitting ships for carrying these aircraft has progressed as far as the rate of delivery of important stores from England has allowed, and it is hoped that the stations at Brindisi and Malta will very shortly be in good working order.The value and uses of Kite Balloons have been the subject of discussion recently, and it is proposed to employ them for offensive patrols on the Otranto Barrage, as well as for convoy work throughout the Mediterranean.H.N.P. 494.   775.   5/18,
SECTION I.ANTI-SUBMARINE REPORT AND STATISTICAL TABLES.AEGEAN GROUP.  (9th March-16th April, 1918).General.Submarine activity in the vicinity of the Skopelos Islands has shewn a marked increase of late, and aerial reconnaissance in this region is considered to. be of great importance The best time for submarine searching in this area appears to be at dusk and dawn, but except for periods of bright moon, this patrol is impossible from Lemnos, and for this reason the establishment of a small advance Base at Khelidromi Island is under consideration.Mines have been detected by aircraft in the JEgean on two occasions.Seaplane Carrier &quot; Ark Royal &quot; moved from Mudros to Syra on 16th April.  .Marsh, Lemnos.On 21st March, Short Seaplane No. N. 1668 Flight) Lieutenant Davies, Observer Sub. Lieutenant Wishaw) on patrol North of Lemnos sighted an enemy floating mine one mile S.E. of Sideriti Island just before dark. An unsuccessful attempt was made to explode it, and the machine returned on account of approaching darkness to report position.ADRIATIC GROUP.  (9th March-2nd April).Routine anti-submarine patrols have been carried out. No enemy submarines or mines have been reported during this period. *A system of moonlight patrols from Otranto has been arranged, but weather conditions have been unfavourable during the month of March.MALTA GROUP.  (1st to 30th April).Regular anti-submarine patrols have been carried out, and two attacks on enemy submarines have been made during this period. Convoy escort work has been carried out whenever weather and times of arrival or departure of convoys have permitted.Seaplane Carrier &quot; Manxman &quot; arrived at Malta, 13th April, to be docked in order to ship a new propeller. On 24th April she proceeded to Marsa Seirocco to embark machines and carry out exercises.Details of attacks carried out.On April 4th, at 1145, Short Seaplane No. N. 1821 (Pilot Flight Sub-Lieutenant Bentley, Observer L. A. C. Chapman) left on patrol in response to an &quot; Allo &quot; 350 50&apos; N., 15&quot; 22&apos;E., 1010.The pilot steered a course of 110c as submarine was reported steering South. After flying for 30 minutes on this bearing, submarine was sighted eight miles ahead on the surface, steering South.The pilot manceuvered so that the sun was behind him and proceeded to attack.One 651b. bomb was dropped from 800 feet while submarine was still on surface, and fell 30 feet astern. A second run was made over the submarine, which was preparing to dive, but the sights could not be got on the target and no bomb was dropped. A third run was made and the remaining 651b. bomb was dropped which fell 50 feet ahead and slightly to the left.The submarine by this time was half submerged and diving steeply.A search was.made in the vicinity for 30 minutes, but no further trace of the submarine was seen.   All bombs being expended, the machine returned to base.The submarine was painted green and white on the sides and green on the deck. She carried one gun forward, which was up when submarine was first passed over, but turned down when diving. Three men were seen on the conning tower. The number on the conning tower appeared to be U.23, to both the pilot and observer. No attempt at anti-aircraft fire was made by the submarine, although the machine was only at 800 feet.The wind at the time of attack was E.N.E., 5 knots^  Sea, smooth.   Visibility, 20-30 miles.Upon receiving signal from Short Seaplane No. N. 1821, giving position of submarine when last seen, Short Seaplaues Nos. N. 1493 and N. 1504 left to continue investigation, but after a prolonged search, returned with nothing to report.Unfortunately on the occasion of this attack, owing to the unfavourable weather conditions, which were such as to render it difficult for machines of this type to rise when carrying heavy bombs, 651b. bombs only were carried.
On 21st April, whilst on escort patrol, Short Seaplane No. N. 1502 (Pilot Captain Rischbeith, Observer Private Clarke) hombed a hostile submarine, Lat. 360 2&apos; N, Long. 140 E. at 1218 G.M.T.A convoy consisting of two merchant steamships and two trawlers was sighted at 1110 G.M.T. and escorted. At 1215, a swirl was noticed on the surface about 4 miles astern of the convoy, and on -flying over this a submarine was observed about GO feet under the surface. A calcium flare was dropped and the machine circled and again flow over position dropping a 230 lb. bomb on the estimated position of the submarine, which at this time could not be seen. The. wind was South 15 knots and the machine was travelling upwind at 1,000 feet when the bomb was dropped.The machine circled round the position, but nothing except the brown stain from the bomb could be seen. A second flare was dropped and four Verys&apos; lights fired to warn the convoy, and both trawlers were called up and signalled &quot; Take care, submarine astern of you, steering South,, position marked by flares&quot; : no answer was received.A further search was made round the position bombed, but nothing further could be seen. Visibility became bad owing to the low clouds drifting over the position, so machine returned to base.EGYPT GROUP.  (1st to 31st March).Anti-submarine patrols from Port Said and Alexandria have necessarily been curtailed during the month of March owing to the absence of Seaplane Carrier &quot; City of Oxford&quot; from the base, and the shortage of pilots.   The latter has now been remedied.Night patrols have been carried out from Port Said wheii possible.Continuous convoy escort work r has been carried out by this Group during the month of March.Seaplane carrier &quot; Empress&quot; left Port Said for Malta, 25th April, preparatory to proceeding to Gibraltar where she will be employed on anti-submarine operations.SHIPS SUNK IN THE MEDITERRANEAN DURING THE MONTH OF APRIL.Date	Name of Ship		Distance from nearest Air Station.

SECTION II.ENEMY COAST AND LAND RECONNAISSANCE,uEGEAN GROUP.Blockade of Turkish Coast.-A reconnaissance of the Asiatic coast was carried out the 28th February, from the Gulf of Adramyti by Aivali to Mityleni Channel as far south as Dikili.Photographs were taken of Krommido Islands and Tuz Burnu, but the visibility was moderate and the photographs were not a success.   Ten tents, in two rows of five, were observedat Islamlah.        .. ... ...      ...      ... .A reconnaissance was made on the 4th March, from the Gulf of Chandarli to Drepano Island and good photographs were taken at Chandarli, Utch Keucheh Burnu, Aslam Burnu (Cape Hydra), and Drepano.Dardanelles Blockade.Reconnaissances of the Straits were carried out on 3rd, 4th, and 7th March, though on the latter occasion the Gliki Aerodrome was too soft for any machine heavier than the &quot;Camel&quot; to rise.   The straits&apos; were reported clear on each occasion.Two D.H. 4 machines, especially prepared with extra petrol tanks (Flight Sub-Lieutenant John W. B. Grigson and Observer Sub-Lieutenant Oswald R. Gayford; Flight Lieutenant Sidney H. Gaskell and Observer SuKLieutenant Edward W. Unmack) left Mudros at 0515, 3rd March to locate and photograph the &quot; Goeben.&quot;The Bulair lines were crossed at 0620, but no anti-aircraft fire or hostile aircraft were observed. Twenty-five to thirty caiques were seen in Rodosto Harbour, only two of which, however, were under way. A large number of railway trucks were seen in the sidings of Chatalja railway station, but no engines were observed. . .Both machines passed over &quot; Goeben &quot; at 0745 and photographs were taken. The &quot; Goeben &quot; was still alongside the jetty on the other side of Istenieh Bay in the same position as when previously photographed, and offered an ideal target for a long distance bombing machine such as the Handley Page. No damage could be observed, although one of the observers states that the &quot;GoebenV decks were conspicuously white, and it is possible that repairs had but recently been executed.Very slight smoke was visible from the after funnel of &quot; Goeben.&quot; A small supply ship of about 500 tons was alongside the starboard side of &quot;Goeben,&quot; abreast the forebridge. No activity could be seen on the jetty, nor were there any signs of work on board the supply ship.Four rounds of high explosive ammunition were fired from the &quot; Goeben &quot; at the second machine, and after leaving the vicinity ten bursts of shrapnel were seen astern.A hostile machine (type unknown) was seen about 500 yards astern. It pursued our machines for about seven miles, and then turned off towards the southward.At Sparta Kule a passenger train of twelve coaches was seen proceeding in a north-westerly direction. No other traffic was moving on the line here, but sixty trucks were stationary in the sidings.One machine was forced to land at Imbros owing to engine trouble, the other landing at Mudros at 1015.From intercepted wireless signals it would appear that a general warning of hostile aircraft had been issued from the &quot; General,&quot; and smoke warning signals were observed at intervals of about twenty miles on the whole course to Constantinople.A further reconnaisance of the Straits was carried out on the 11th March, and again on the morning of the 13th.   None but the usual small shipping was observed.Two D.H.4 machines (Flight Sub-Lieutenant Sidney S. Flook and Observer Lieutenant William R. Abbott.; Flight Sub-Lieutenant Thomas H. Blair and Observer Sub-Lieutenant James R. S. Young) left Repair Base, Mudros, at 0436 14th, to carry out a long-distance reconnaisance to Constantinople to locate and photograph the &quot; Goeben.&quot;Proceeding via Imbros and the Gulf of Xeros, they crossed the coast to Dorkhan, where anti-aircraft fire was experienced. Stenia Bay was reached at 0735, and photographs were taken, of &quot; Goeben,&quot; the Golden Horn, and Haidar Pasha.
Tho &quot;Goebon&quot; was still alongside the jetty on the southern side of the hay.   TheHamidieh &quot; and five destroyers and a torpedo boat were also observed, and no anti-aircraft firefrom &quot; Goeben &quot; was experienced. The supply ship which was previously reported to be alongside had been moved,No smoke was observed from &quot; Gooben&apos;s&quot; funnels.It is interesting to note that S.S. &quot;General&quot; issued the hostile aircraft warning at 0750, from which it would appear that the enemy were taken by surprise.ADRIATIC GROUP.A very successful reconnaissance was carried out on the 5th of April, from No. 66 Wing, &apos; Otranto (Fit. Comdr. Morrison, R.N., Observer Lt. Redfem, R.N., Fit. Sub-Lt. Jeakes and L.A.C. G\ L. Thrift) in two D.H. 4&apos;s left at 0959 arriving over Durazzo at 1193. Three hangars were observed near the shore and one big steamer and five small ones were observed in the harbour. There was some anti-aircraft fire, white and black shells, height correct. A group of huts was noticed ten miles east of Durazzo on the eastern side of the ridge. At Tirana on the road leading from Durazzo there were six or eight white hangars. Rashtbul showed no signs of a seaplane shed. A large camp was seen at Bzrul, containing ten large and ten small sheds for troops and stores. Nothing to report at El Basan or Bulkiz. On the south side of the river Skumbi at Broshka a large camp was seen, possibly a cavalry camp. At Kuchi Bridge there was one large long shed running parallel to the road just north of the Bridge, probably a cavalry camp. South of the Bridge in Kuchi were five large store sheds, No aerodrome was observed at Fieri, but a number of store sheds were spread about the town. There seems to be a standard size store shed or barracks, as they were of a similar shape at Bzrul, Broshka, Kuchi Bridge and Fieri, The machines kept company very well and experienced no difficulty whatever. Very good photographs were taken. It is quite clear that there are no Zeppelin sheds within the area covered by the reconnaissance.Two D.H.4&apos;s from No. 66 Wing, Otranto (Flight Commander Morrison, Observer Lieutenant Redfern, Flight SubLieutenant Jeakes and Observer Sub-Lieutenant Hodgson) left at about 10.0 a.m. on 12th April to reconnoitre the Gulf of Cattaro and Antivari. Excellent photographs of the coast line and shore from Igalo to a point east of Gjenovic and of Teodo Harbour and Dockyard were obtained. At Igalo an aerodrome was seen between the road and the railway. On the northern side of the aerodrome are four camouflaged hangars, and on the eastern side a red brick shed. This aerodrome appears to be from 400 to 500 yards square. No signs of any airship sheds were seen throughout the reconnaissance.Between Porto Rosa and Castle Nuovo there were four vessels anchored in line abreast, possibly torpedo boats, but it is probable they were part of the boom.Thirteen ships were anchored off Zelenika and Kumbor, four of them were lying near the entrance to the port; these were painted a dark colour and it was difficult to ascertain what they were.   The remainder appear to have been merchant vessels.Between Kumbor and Pristinje, four or five ships of various sizes were anchored, apparently store ships.Four hundred yards South of Gjenovic, six torpedo boats were moored together and 200 yards East of these were four submarines. 200 yards South East of the submarines a four-funnelled cruiser of the &quot; Novara &quot; type was lying at Anchor.A hospital ship was seen about 1  miles East of Gjenovic.One large merchant vessel was seen in Durazzo harbour and one in Antivari harbour.One three-funnelled man-of-war was anchored outside Teodo harbour. Inside the dockyard were four ships, probably merchant vessels.SECTION III.FIGHTING AND FIGHTER ESCORT WORK.  BOMB RAIDSON LAND OBJECTIVES.ADRIATIC GROUP.A raid on Durazzo was carried out from Otranto on the morning of 23rd April. Only one gunboat was seen in harbour. Merchant vessels and seaplane base were attacked. Two 230 lb. bombs and sixteen 100 lb. bombs were dropped with apparently successful results.All machines returned safely.Full details of the attack have not yet been received.EGYPT GROUP.Seaplane Carrier &quot; City of Oxford &quot; has been employed under the orders of the Senior Air Officer, Red Sea Patrol, during the month of March assisting the Idrissi troops in their action against the enemy.   Her presence there is reported to have been most useful.
