CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,[July 11, 1918.] Foreign Office,Moslem Countries /004.MEMORANDUMONGERMAN! AND CENTRAL ASIAN COTTON.THE RE have been reports lately that the Germans are endeavouring to control the Central Asian cotton crop. On the 3rd April last there was a statement in the Petrograd press that German firms were petitioning the German Government to secure a monopoly of Turkestan cotton for forty-eight years.1 It has since been stated that a German-Austrian organisation has been formed for this purpose ;2 and the activities of such an organisation may appear in a report in the Eussian official &quot;Izvestiya&quot; (quoted by the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; 24th April, 1918) that German agents (mostly nationals of neutral States) are buying up not only existing stocks of cotton, but future harvests in Khiva, Ferghana, Trans-Caspia, and other Central Asian districts, as well as in Trans-Caucasia. The agents are said to be paying large advances -the advance system being an established feature of the Central Asian cotton trade.3No doubt the Germans will do their utmost to obtain from the spheres opened to them overland in the East such raw material as cotton, from which they are cut off by the Allies&apos; blockade of the seas. But a closer examination of the cotton situation in Central Asia points to the conclusion that at any rate in the case of this particular commodity there is little possibility of obtaining, from &quot; Middle Europe-and-Asia,&quot; supplies in sufficient quantity, or at an early enough date, to compensate to any practical degree for the loss of the pre-war import into Germany from overseas.This view is supported by several considerations   -1. Quantity and Quality of the Central Asian Cotton Crop.4&quot;Since the incorporation of Central Asia in the Russian Empire (1863-85) both the Moscow cotton industry and the Russian Government have aimed at supplying the demand for raw cotton in Russian factories from cotton grown in Russian territory. This object was promoted by high tariffs and immense railway construction; yet in&apos; 1912 only 51 per cent, of the Russian consumption5 was met by the crop from Central Asia and Trans-Caucasia.Since German industry consumed about 1*25 times as much cotton as Russian industry in the years immediately preceding the war, it will be seen that, even if the whole of this crop were to be at Germany&apos;s sole disposal, it would count for little in comparison with the loss of the import from overseas.Central Asian cotton, moreover, is of poor quality. Attempts have been made to introduce American seed and methods of cultivation ; but technical progress was retarded by the fact that the crop was grown, not on large plantations, but by native peasant proprietors. The material was only good enough for manufacturing rough goods, which were mostly reimported for the Central Asian market.The immediate result of the war was to increase the Central Asian supply, since Moscow was largely deprived of the import from overseas. The cotton area was extended at the expense of other crops, and the cotton harvest of 1915, which was exceptionally fine, totalled 20,519,000 puds, or something like 85 per cent, of the normal demand of the Russian cotton industry.0 But this was a maximum. In 1916 the crop dropped to 14,901,000 puds, a decrease of 27&apos;8 per cent, on the crop of the previous year ;0 and in 1917, again, the area in Central Asia under cotton cultivation decreased 37&apos;45 per cent, as compared with 1916.   The crop for 1917 is estimated1 &quot; Watergate House Daily,&quot; April 5,1918.* &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; III, 2.s &quot; Watergate House Economic,&quot; May 28,1918.4 Statistics in an article by H. Koch : &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; III, 3.6 Or just under 60 per cent, if the crop of Northern Persia and Chinese Turkestan is reckoned in. 6 &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; I, 6.[367-27]
to have amounted to 10,000,000 puds only, including the preceding years surplus.7 After three seasons of war the Central Asian cotton crop has thus sunk to an inconsiderable quantity, and the bulk of what is still produced is said to be of inferior grades.2. Russian and German Competition,In the second place, Germany will not have undisputed access to the Central Asian supplies, for in spite of the war and the revolution, the Russian textile industry is still in being and even shows symptoms of recovery.8 It has already displayed serious concern at the setback in the Central Asian cotton production, and is most unlikely to admit any German claim to share in the diminished output. The Moscow textile industry is one of the most important economic concerns in Russia, both as regards the amount of its capital and the number of its workmen. Its interests and its point of view are therefore bound to influence the policy of any Russian Government of whatever political creed; and any rights over the Central Asian crop which Germany may extort from a Russian Government temporarily at her mercy will be subject to determined efforts on the part of this important interest to obtain their repudiation. Moreover, the only means by which the urban centres in Russia are at present able to obtain food-stuffs from the peasants is by offering manufactured goods in exchange, and cotton goods are the manufacture of which the peasants are chiefly in need, since during the war the normal supply to the civil population has been largely diverted to the army. The maintenance of the supply of raw cotton from Central Asia is thus a wide-spread national interest of Russia.In the autumn of 1917, a few weeks before the Bolshevik Revolution, a conference of the various branches of the cotton trade and of several Government departments met at Moscow, apparently on the initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture, to consider how the cotton shortage should be met.9 The only practical suggestion seems to have been an increase in the import from overseas (a programme which it has, of course, been impossible to carry out). The restoration of the Central Asian output to the 1915 level does not seem to have been contemplated as possible. The break-down of the banking system and the increase in the rouble value of raw cotton have combined with the actual shortage of the crop to bring the trade virtually to a standstill.10The Bolsheviks, however, dealt drastically with the cotton question as soon as they had established their power in Central Asia (February-March 1918) as well as in European Russia. The Bolshevik Commissariat at Tashkend simply &quot;nationalised&quot; all stocks of raw cotton in Central Asia, including the crop of 1917 and the surplus from the previous year, reckoned at 10.000,000 puds together.11On the 6th April the president of the Cotton Committee of the Bolshevik Government at Moscow sent a wireless message to the Commissaries at Tashkend urging them to &quot; organise immediately a more active transport of cotton to Moscow,&quot; and promising manufactured goods in return.13 A similar message, in greater detail, was sent on the 28th June. And in the Petrograd &quot;Izvestiya&quot; of the 11th April it was announced that the Government had allocated 502,000,000 (?) roubles for the purchase of cotton in Turkestan and its transport to European Russia.13Moscow and Berlin are thus in clear competition, and Moscow has the advantages of past and present possession on its side. There are, of course, other factors that tell in Germany&apos;s favour. The increasing dependence of the Bolsheviks on Germany may compel them to give the competition up, or, worse, pretend to continue it while really transporting the cotton westwards on Germany&apos;s behalf. The wireless of the 28th June, which is couched in mysterious language, may actually cover some deal of the kind. But if the Bolsheviks have really been driven to&apos;this, it will set the whole Moscow cotton interest against them, and so in the end precipitate their fall.Germany may also gain from the reaction against Russia which the violence of the Bolshevik coup d&apos;etat in Central Asia has provoked among the native Moslem population and even among the local Russian bourgeoisie.On the 4th March a meeting of the Tashkend Branch of the Russian Association of Cotton Growers and Manufacturers protested formally, against the loss of life andI &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; II, 1.8 &quot; Novaya Zhizn,&quot; April 13, 1918. &quot; &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; I, 11/12; II, 2, 4, io &quot;Neuer Orient,&quot; II, 6/7, 8.II Moscow &quot; Izvestiya,&quot; quoted by &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,&quot; April 24, 1918. 12 &quot; Watergate House Daily,&quot; April 9, 1918.13 &quot; Watergate House Neutral,&quot; June 28,1918.  It is not clear how this squares with &quot;nationalisation.&quot;
property caused by the destruction of Kokand during the fighting in February between the. Bolsheviks and the Moslem Provisional Government.14&apos; And &quot;nationalisation &quot; at Kokand, in the instance of one important firm, took the form of the seizure of 181,000 roubles cash intended for the workmen&apos;* wages.15 These facts lend credibility to a more recent report that the growers and dealers in Turkestan are holding back both the old stock and the 1917 crop from tin Bolsheviks, in order to sell them to German buyers and to a Finnish purchasing agency.But whatever party gains the advantage in the competition for the Central Asian cotton crop, the crop itself, as shown above, has been vastly diminished and that in a permanent way by the restoration of cotton land to cereal cultivation.3. Return of Cotton-land to Cereal Cultivation.Cultivation in Central Asia depends on irrigation, and the total cultivable area at any given moment is therefore strictly limited by the amount of water made available by the existing canals and storages.Before the Russian conquest there was an irrigation system in Central Asia, maintained from very early times; and in the absence of security and of good commu-nications, each oasis apportioned its water to the cultivation of all the crops both textile materials (cotton and silkj and foodstuffs (cereals) necessary for the supply of its own local needs.After the conquest the Russians set out to increase the production of cotion; but instead of increasing the irrigable area in proportion, they simply induced the native peasant, by high prices and advances, to extend the area under cotton cultivation at the expense of his other crops. The deficit in foodstuffs was made good by transport, via, the new railways, from European Russia, and the year before the war the annual import of cereals into Central Asia had reached the volume of 18,000,000 puds.16 The food supply of Central Asia thus became very precarious, since the railway connection was not with the nearer grain-producing districts such as Syeriiiryetch, the Steppe Governments, or Western Siberia but with the Northern Caucasus and the Middle Volga; and when, about the time of the revolution, transport began to break down, Central Asia was faced with starvation, especially the densely-populated province of Ferghana, in which the conversion of corn-land into cotton-land had chiefly taken place.This increased the unrest already produced among the Central Asian peasantry by the decree of the Provisional Government forbidding the conveyance of land pending its nationalisation.17 And on the 18th September, 1917, there was a congress of Central Asian cotton-growers, which censured the Government for failing to prevent the famine, and recommended the reconversion of cotton-land into corn-land. Resolutions in the same sense were passed by a general congress of Central Asian associations which met at Tashkend on the 12th September.18This policy was not only essential in the interests of the Central Asian consumer, it was actually profitable to the agrarian producers themselves. For though the price of cotton had risen and that sufficiently to paralyse the financing of the cotton trade  the price of flour had risen out of all proportion: from 2 or 2*50 roubles per pud in the autumn of 1916 to 30 or 40 roubles in June 1917 ! This represents a rise of from 1,500 to J ,600* per cent., and by the autumn of 1917 wheat had actually become a more profitable crop than cotton in Central Asia.This tendency has been greatly accentuated since the Bolshevik revolution by the cutting of the Tashkend-Moscow Railway. This was done by the Orenburg Cossacks, and traffic on this route does not seem to have been restored. In Central Asia, and especially in Ferghana, the famine has become so bad that recent reports speak of a number of deaths daily from starvation in the principal towns.The diminution of cotton in favour of cereal cultivation is thus dictated by an over-mastering necessity, which it will take months, and perhaps years, of reconstruction to remove. Meanwhile, the area under cereals is said to have increased already since 1916 by something, between 15 and 50 per cent.19w &quot; Watergate House Neutral,&apos;&quot; May 14, 1918. 16 &quot; Watergate House Neutral,&quot; June 14, 1918. 16 &quot; Neuer Orient,&quot; II, 1.17 &quot; Neuer Orient, I, 9.

o4. Conclusions.&apos; The facts considered above seem to support the conclusion that Central Asian cotton cannot replace for Germany her pre-war import from overseas.For a far-sighted investor in easy circumstances, with plenty of liquid capital, and S content with distant returns, it might be an exceedingly profitable transaction to buy up Central Asia cheap in its present disorganised condition and put it into working order again. But none of the belligerent Powers, and least of all Germany, will find themselves in that position at the end of the war. All will need an immediate replenishment of their stocks and an immediate turnover on their outlay. At the same time the world, considered from the economic point of view, is falling more and more into two categories-the zone, steadily increasing, which is being devastated by the war and which will be a liability and not an asset during the period of reconstruction; and the zone, steadily diminishing, which remains intact and from which immediate economic advantages will be obtainable during the same period. The character of the Avar-a struggle between a single Power with a military ascendancy on land against a coalition of nearly all the other Powers in both hemispheres naturally tends to place Germany in physical position of the devastated zone, and to leave the intact zone in the hands of the Entente.In the case of cotton, at any rate, the situation will be this : the war-map will have placed Germany in possession of the important Central Asian area of production, but will at the same time have drawn this area into the zone of devastation. And this will mean tha*t Germany, in order to realise her potential resources here, will have first to restore political order, under her own hegemony, in Central Asia and all countries lying between it and the German frontier ; then to rebuild the railways and replenish their rolling-stock; then to carry out great engineering works to increase the total area under cultivation; and, finally, to restore credit, starting from the present exchange in kind to which commerce has sunk in Asiatic Russia. AH this she will have to do before she can import a single bale of cotton from Central Asia to a German mill..The Allies, on the other hand, will be able simply to continue the import of raw cotton from Egypt and the cotton belt of the United States which they have organised and reserved for themselves during the war. And they will be able to increase the volume of this import with every new ship they launch, without having to undertake any of the great social, political, financial, and engineering operations which must be performed by Germany before she can import any cotton at all.Thus a post-war distribution of raw cotton on the basis of the war-map would be ruinous to Germany. Or, in other words, the economic war-map in respect of cotton offers an exceedingly favourable basis for bargaining from the Allied point of view. In fact, if the question is regarded in strictly economic terms,&apos; it would be a positive disadvantage to Germany to be saddled with the reconstruction of the cotton cultivation, of Central Asia, while the Central Asian cotton-growers would obtain a corresponding economic advantage by inducing Germany to undertake the task.That is to put the case in economic terms; but, of course, the fact that the Central Asian cotton-growers need the economic intervention of some outside party to set them, on their feet again means that Germany, as the nearest available agent of recon-struction, has a political leverage upon Central Asia. And the party a*t present in power in Germany might conceivably be prepared to face the economic loss in order to reap the political advantage.Germany, called in to reconstruct Central Asia by a population weary of Bolshevik . domination, would be a formidable menace to the British Empire in the Middle East, and she will no doubt be tempted to pursue this political objective. On the other hand,, our best way of bargaining her out of it is to emphasise the economic ruin, in respect of the cotton industry, which it involves for her, and to hold out to her the prospect of obtaining a share in the immediate cotton production of Egypt and America if she will renounce the political ascendancy in. Central Asia (and with it, of course, the ultimate economic monopoly) which the war map has placed in her hands.
