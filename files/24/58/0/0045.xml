The Admiralty are directing the Commander in Chief.

The Commander in Chief, East Indies, has al30 been   directed to send a Naval Officer to Enseli in order to   obtain first hand information as regards the ships, their fitting out and their personnel.I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   AIEX FLINT, The Under Secretary of State, for Secretary.Foreign Office.ENSLOSURE TO ADMIRALTY LETTER No. M.0215571.   There are practically no prospects, or at any rate very few, of obtaining control of the ships in tha Caspian Sea.There are at present 50 British soldiers at Enzell together with 300 Red Guards.   The latter at present profess to be friendly but they may turn hostile at any moment.   The British force at Enzell cannot be increased until the situation as regards supplies is improved.   Inhere is only one road for supplies from Mesopotamia, and dumps are now being made as far forward as possible.   There are supports at Kazvin.Officers have been despatched to Krasnovdsk which is con3i&amp;-ered to be an important place, being situated on the; Caspian Sea opposite to Baku.Tho Russian Bicharekov with 1200 Russians has gone to Baku from Enzell by water, but it is not known in M.I. in what nature of vessels they ombarked.   These Russians are at present Anti-Turk and Anti-German, but they can do nothing and may go over to the enemy when they find themselves outnumbered.   The Turco-Ge^man forces are about 20 miles from Baku.
Copy of Telegram, from    G.H.Q. Mesopotamia.To       War Office, Repeated to C-iu-C East Indies.Despatched at 1.15 p.m. 3/7/18. Received    at 8.30 a..m.       4/7/13.1,9965. July 3rd.tYour 610 7 cipher M.0.2. June 26th.Fo*jlowing report from Dunsterville:-Emeli would make excellent base fox seaplanes. Murd&amp;b is a large stretch of open: water which is always calm. Russian fisheries have good workshops.   Oil and petroleum could be obtained from Baku.   Plenty of timber for hangars.2.   If ships can be obtained they will require personnel to officer and man thorn, or at any rate to control the present crews.   The ships will also require arming with euitable guns.*3.   Enzeli is said to be a good place for seaplanes (vide copy of telegram below).4.   Our forces on tho Caspian Sea are under the G.O.C. Mesopotamia, who is sending up supplies and reinfercements. -5.   In order to obtain command of the Caspian Sea, it will be necessary to ana some of the merchant ships with guns of   * &apos; at least   4.7&quot; calibre.Even if the two gunboats (armament   2-4.7&quot;, 4-1 prs, 4- machine guns) can be secured, it is not considered that they will suffice, for active operations, as it will be feasible for the enemy to arm any of the merchant ships that he may find at Baku.6.   The War Office are urging the War Cabinet to make the Government of India adopt a constructive policy with regard to the Amir, with a view to his taking action in Merv and Bokhara, and so checking the German and Turk designs in the direction of India;
