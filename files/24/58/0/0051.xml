SECRET.

BATTLE SITUATION - EVENING - 18th JULY, 1918.

1. (a) FRENCH FRONT. Between CHATEAU THIERRY and the ARGONNE the situation remains unchanged.

Between CHATEAU THIERRY and the AISNE the French attacked on a 35 kilometre front this morning.

Between TROESNES and the AISNE the attack was launched at 4.35 a.m. without artillery preparation, whilst the attack between BELLEAU and TROESNES was launched at 6 a.m. after 90 minutes artillery preparation. Tanks supported both attacks.

Reports timed at 1 p.m. showed that excellent progress is being made, especially in the North where the assaulting troops have advanced to an average depth of 6 miles, and now hold the Western side of the CRISE VALLEY. In this part of the front alone 4,000 prisoners and 30 guns have been captured.

The line runs approximately as follows :- Southern bank of the AISNE to the MONTAGNE DE PARIS (French) - BERZY LE SEC (French) - between BUZANCY and VILLEVLAIN - Hill 190 (North of BLANZY) - 300 yards west of CHOUY - West of NEUILLY-ST-FRONT  - HILL 167 (East of MONNES) - COURCHAMPS (French) - LICY CLIGNON - TORCY BELLEAU.

Considerable resistance has apparently been encountered astride the Valley of the OURCQ and large bodies of the enemy have been observed moving North and West in this neighbourhood.

(b) BRITISH FRONT. The situation is unchanged.

2. ITALIAN AND MACEDONIAN FRONTS. There is nothing of interest to report.
