REPORT BY MR. FRANK BAINB3.To r- The Field Marshal Comraanding-in-Chief British Armies in Prance.Sir,At your request I visited certain areas in Prance with a view to ascertaining whether the utmost possible efficiency is being secured under the existing&quot; administration and control of labour.    The two essent-ial factors which governed my inspection were (l) The economic utilisation of labour and (2) the method of controlling works and labour services.    To this end, labour employed upon works and services of diverse character was inspected, and enquiry was directed into schemes and the design of works and lay-outs as appreved in progress or completed, from the point of view of economy and of their necessity under known conditions. No attempt was made to effect a comparison in economy and efficiency between civil and military works and labour services, as the system of costing and checking which obtains in civil affairs is inapplicable to services carried out under varying degrees of urgency and military necessity.:The labour employed is of two main   categories (a) unskilled, (b) skilled.    Some of the former could certainly be classed as skilled or semi-skilled, while a certain proportion of it may be said to be in process of training as skilled labour.    This was noticeable under good direction, and it was observed that the efficiency of the labour and the extent of its skill were definitely increased by the training. As to (b), the Units in this category, at least in certain instances, could not be said to consist entirely of fully skilled or even partly skilled work-ers, while Units which were known to be skilled as the result of previous civilian training, were not always found to be employed solely upon work calling for the exercise of that skill.    Instances could be given, if required, where highly trained Units were partly engaged upon work of a purely unskilled character,Division of labour. (3).
- 2 -Divi si on       (3)       it would appear that the practioal economio&quot; of &quot;&quot;&quot; sub-division of labour into these two main categories., labour. which operates automatically in civil employment^ has .broken down in France, if, indeed,.such a division was ever fully recognised or followed.      In fact, the method of decentralised control of skilled, units renders the employment of such skilled Units: upon&apos;work of lower grade almost inevitable.     Such s prsctiec3, if followed to any considerable extent, must result in a very material wastage o$ labour, for not only is there the loss, occasioned by the character of the employment, but the efficiency of the labour so employed is reduced - partly no doubt owing to the dissatisfaction with the nature of the work upon which the skilled Units are engaged.Clashes (4).      The unskilled labour consists of the followingof main classes:-UnsHlledLabour. (a).        23Q British Labour Companies.Nominal strength, 500 each.(NOTB:   The total strength is approximately 22,000 short at the present time).(b) Canadian labour Battalions.These battalions are designed to work solely with the Canadian Corps.(g).    ,   British ?ost Indian Battalion.These are allotted by the A.6. to the Armies for ammunition work.&apos; During the winter the labour Section allots work for this Unit.- .(d).        7 Companies of Ron-Combatant Corps.There are roughly 100 men in each Company, the men being used for timber felling, roads, etc     Their use is precluded within the fighting area, or upon work in connection with munitions, etc.(e),       One Oar)e Coloured Battalion, (f),        15 Companies of Douth African Nativeswho have to be put into compounds and are not employed within shelled areas.(g).       Alien Labour Companies.nominal strength, 500.These should be good workers, being mostly ,TAn men, but they cannot be   employed near the front lines or on ammunition work, and ,    &apos;they can only be worked with the concurrence of the Intelligence Section, and further they cannot be employed at base ports.
(h)   185 Chinese Companies,Is,.nt - etc.tek on Fur.These men have to be compounded and utilised in areas outside 30 kilometres of the front line.to be suffering from Trachoma, to bo confined within agroedSome ore found and these have Trachoma areas.( i)   124 Companies, of Prisoners of gaj*.   1 &apos; -Approximately A-6% in a Company.&apos; These men are not allowed to be worked on Munitions of 17ar or Within 30 kilometres of the front line.   This labour, in all, totals roughly 305,000 men, inclusive of Area Employment Companies&apos;, or approximately 262,500 raen exclusive of about 130 Area 3mploy.^ent Companies.     The utilisation of this largo number in works and services appears to be mainly upon a military basis, no attempt apparently having been made to adopt the civiDian method of direct control on the work or site through working gangers, leading hands, setters out, working sub-foremen, foremen,- etc.     Even where labour was noted to be working consistently well, trained working control was apparently non-existent, supervision being obtained through Comtossioned and Ion-Commissioned Officers, acting in part from a ,purely disciplinary point of view, and in part as task-setters,     A considerable increase in efficiency might Well be anticipated if some sort of working control were instituted to lay down the method of execution of the work, and to: see that the programme of labour to be carried out was efficiently planned. ...(5).        In certain cases,, the proper hand tools were not being utilised.     This point is of importance where labour is engaged on simple repetitive operations where a small percentage of loss would materially decrease outputx.     Indifference to the use of mechanical&apos; labour-saving methods and appliances appeared to be general, both with the skilled and unskilled unitsx the utilisation of the labour being on a basis diametrically opposed to civilian contractual methods of employment, where every effort.has to be directed to exclude waste and increase efficiency in order that capital cost may be reduced to a minimum and prospective profit increased. . . -(6) Further, inapplicable as it may be to the Army services&apos;in France, the complete absence of-any costing system and the . lack of comparative efficiency records prepared under centralised control, militates against the setting of practical and economic standards of work.     The efficiency graphs and charts seen were prepared &quot;by the officers in control of the specific works and labour services.     They may, or may not, have been correct, but in cases they appeared to present the best aspect by charting work done in/Instances can be given if required.

It was noted that General order No. &apos;35o2 on the organi-sation and administration of unskilled labour gives power to the &quot;Controller of Labour&quot; to keep &quot;the necessary &quot;statistics and records&quot;; but owing, no doubt, to laok fit Staff, this would not appear to be done bo far as independent efficiency charts arc concerned.(7).   Generally the standard&apos;of working of labour inspected was.low in all the instances seen, with one exoeption, to be noted later.   In certain cases the labour was not giving within 60$ of its estimated normal efficiency, while in a few instances the stan-dard was lower than this.   In one case, the efficiency oould not have approached within 15$ to ZOfa of the normal, and may well have been below this.   The oir-oumstances, though admittedly exceptional, exhibited as bad a case- tf ineffective labour as could veil be imagined-.   The labour was drawn from reinforcements liable to be sent to employed, urgency.supervised by Officers drawn from various Units, apparently made no effort even to appear to be working, and as their number amounted to several hundreds the effect of their example on the non-military labour units working in the vicinity must have been highly detri-imental.(8).   Chinese labour as inspected was found to be very Unequal, due partly to the method of supervision and partly to the character of the work undertaken.   The opinion was formed that the use of this labour was not being fully exploited,   ^flaere Chinese labour is used on simple and even skilled repetitive operations it is found to be good, but where the organisation ia not olearly laid down and unsatisfactory conditions of working prevail, its efficiency would appear to have dropped considerably.   The whole of the Chinese labour is supplied on a contractual basis, as between Go^ern-ments, and it is not understood why some simple method Of bonusing such labour has not been instituted in order to get a full return for the hours of working. It is understood that there are certain objections to this, but the. point is of such importance that they should, if possible, be overcome.   The system of &quot;tasking&quot; Chinese labour to increase its efficiency has apparently had good results, but has only proved effective when the hours of labour have been reduced to as little, in certain instances, as 6 hours to 6^ hours a day.   when the shortness of this working day was commented upon, the answer was that even on&apos;such an hourly day under task work more work was done than under the system of full time work on the same class of work.   This, however, would appear to be conclusive evidence that the labour is not being effectively employed.(9)   - The prisoner of iar labour seen was, in many cases, working far below efficiency.   Considerable laxity on the part of the supervisors existed, largely owing to the difficulty of dealing //  Instances can be given if required.
with this class of labour;     in certain oases it was not working to within       of what night he considered its normal&quot;efficiency.The Prisoner of War labour working at certain quarries, where operations are of such a very simple character as can be readily supervised and tasked, was &apos;  the best seen.    Even here, however, it was considered that the output could be increased.Task work has been introduced in connection with this class of labour in tho effort to increase its efficiency by introducing the spur of self-interest. In most cases, however, this was only rene^votl, effective by making the tasks such as would allow the men to be relieved from work after a very short day, such as from 6 to 6% hours.     Such conditions of working cannot be considered satisfactory.en Labour. (10).      Alien LaboUr Companies, ail of Class &quot;A&quot; men apparently, were hot working up to their maximum efficiency.     These Companies should be specially organised for heavy work and be severely tasked, as the work they were doing in certain instances was careless . and slack, and showed an entire lack of energy*     This labour co^ld be materially speeded up by being properly organised .itur. at        (ll).      The Labour which presents the most serious Its and      difficulties is the labour engaged on largo Depots and WqbI   r     Stores,     In certain cases the gravest waste of labour wasAobserved .     The organisation bf such labour at the Depots requires very special consideration.dard of    (12).      Generally, the failure to moke full demands upon : and Task the energy and output of the pool of unskilled labour is &quot;materially reducing the free offer-of work on the part of such labour.     It is reducing the standard of work in the minds of the men employed, and unless a very considerable increase in the standard reauired from such labour generally is demanded, the depreciation will undoubtedly continue.The Supervisors and Controllers appeared to be alive to the problem, but the method of control is not such as to allow&apos; of any very complete and definite scheme being put into operation.     The variation in standard is great everywhere, and no attempt appears to have been made to get an exceptional Unit in goodtrim as a show unit, to spur up &quot;Employers&quot; of Labour by its example.     Throughout tho employment of labour, the only consistent effort to increase its efficiency is based on the idea of task work, which, in many of the most wasteful employments is in-applicable, and in others has merely resulted in a very limited working day,Task work is undoubtedly beneficial in some ways, but owing to the fact that the task has generally been fixed too low, the time workers not engaged upon task work are still further withholding  heir effective labour. Apparently little power exists to enforce adequate task work or to base the standard working day on a reasonable hourly basic

(13).        Tho labour which was found to bo working withthe greatest willingness mid efficiency was tho labour employed on the defence lines in the &quot;ocond -iorps area of tho Second Army beyond  operinghe.      This labour was drawn from the British Labour Companies and no sign whatever of slacking was noticed&apos;on this work. iSyon this, labour, however, was working without any very skilled direction in the way of Navvy $eager8., who, with ouch good material, could still further increase its output;pooled UnsEiTledLabour.SkilledLabour.(14).       The whole of this unskilled labour is supposed to bo included in a general   pool drawn upon for all w works re-&apos;Uirod, and is administered and allocated by the Controller of Labour, acting under tho Quartermaster General, for works, the priority of which has boonsettled by theChiefof ;taff.     In reality, however.the pool is not as fluid as it might be, for rrhon thelabour is definitely allocated not for specific work it would sometimes difficult to draw it to its employment upon work of rsforsnoo to specific needs, certain way definitely acting as a pool, as the diagrams, prepared by the Labour &quot;action showing the disposal of labour, would appear to prove.to a particular area and appear that it is from such areas owing all classes without It is, however, in a(15).        An attempt was made to gain some idea of tho character, skill and totel numbers of men included in skilled or specialiseg&quot; Units, but no information on this point was found to be readily available.   The skilled Units generally wore found to work best in workshop practice, but to work ineffectively and badly when engaged upon unskilled and low grade work.In&apos;certain instances,. Units of the unskilled labour pool were found to bo working as skilled men beside the skilled Units., illustrating the possibility of increasing the efficiency of tho unskilled Units in some cases.Ho idea was gained as to how the relative numbers of skilled and unskilled men were fixed as adequate for specific work to be undertaken.,    In some cases the numbers were   found to be admittedly wrong, with the resultant loss of efficiencyItwes gathered that, in: certain cases, demands for allocation of unskilled labour are mo.de without any reference to the number -jf skilled Units who are also to be employed on the specific work or service, while when demands for allotment of unskilled labour ere presented no information appears to be conveyed as to the character or extent of thespecificf  See footnote page 4.

In such olroumstances it is difficult to ascor r.ain, how eny adequate and scientific allotment of unskilled labour can be made.fooled       (16).&apos;    It would appear, therefore, that the demands ^H^led     of the various services and directorates are.balanced gbourT     and that those arc met which have the highest priority under the orders of the Chief of Staff.The skilled and specialised labour Units do not appear to be organised under any so-called pool, but to be organised under individual Directorates, such as the D.G.!.?., Directors of Services, and Departments, etc. Such Directorates organise and control, within their own areas of work, the specialised Units;   although in practice, under a system of individual liaison, Officers wore observed to loan specialised; Units to Officers in other Directorates.    This helpful action would appear to be apart from the system organised and is apparently due. to direct liaison between Officers in charge of specific works and services.      Instances such as.this would appear to make it clear that the necessity for pooling the skilled labour has been observed;   the action taken, however, may have been quite unofficial and certainly did not apply to Units of any considerable number.The fact that the skilled labour Units remain unpooled under the direct supervision :of Directorates and even under Sub-Directorates, each with complete individual control, would appear to render this labour liable to be employed on services other than those for which it was specially recruited, when not urgently reeuired for specific skilled services.      Such action would retain the labour rather than allow it to be transferred to : another Directorate where skilled labour may at the moment &apos; be urgently required.     To shut up this labour (by its nature and training the most effective of its kind in France) in water-tight compartments, certainly appears to be lacking in economy, while the evidence seen of the utilisation of skilled Units in work of lower grade would also support this view.Priority 0.7).    ^s a comparison with the general labour question lor in connection with the iirraies in Franco, the positionlaoour.      in England to-day might prove of interest.    Practically - the whole of the work undertaken in England at this time . is undertaken under an. order of priority;, definitely settled by the. War Cabinet priorities Committee.    The works are then groded, both for material and labour., in aocordancQ with the opinion of that Committee as to its urgency.   , &apos;$orthis purpose, the following particulars are given to the Committee:(a)    The number of skilled and unskilled men required for the work:
The time required to. complete the work:The quant it lea of material-roquir-ed-. to complete the work in steel, timber, cement, bricks, &amp;o., &amp;c.The availability of such material and means of transit;Tho reasons for the urgenoy of the work supported by notes from the Department interested in the work.This, in effect, pools the whole of the labour available in -England, together with the whole of the material so far as it is controlled, and the effect is th&amp;t only those works which have been given a specific priority are enabled to obtain the necessary labour and msterial and ary consequently allowed to proceed before works of lower priority and grade, which may also have been passed.      The necessity for such priority and grading in France is known to be even greater than that in England, owing to military exigencies and changes in the military situation from time to time.   The reoog-nition, however, of the need for meeting the new situation with regard to demands for labour, etc, hs they arise, hns not, apparently, gone so far as to acknowledge the urgency of pooling the whole of the labour available for all the works in Prance.Under thy present system in France, certain forceful Directorates might conceivably be able to obt&amp;in greater numbers of men in their skilled labour Units than other Directorates,   hile their work, at cortain periods, might not justify the numbers obtained.      Only by pooling the totality of this labour for the whole of the sor-vices required, under specific priority in Pranoe, csn the labour&apos; be continuously and efficiently employed.Tho fact that the necessities of the work in Prance have imdo it advisable to attempt some sort of pool with regard to unskilled labour is sufficient evidence of the necessity for continuing that principle still further so that all the labour can be freely-directed to any specific service requiring it under order of urgency.The attempt to pool skilled labour is thought to present many difficulties with exisitng organisa-tions;   in effect, however, it should h&amp;ve few serious objections for the following reasons:-(a).   The pooling would merely give thopower to withdraw skilled labour from bad &quot;^inployers&quot; not adequately utilising same:(b). Good Directorates with first rate supervision would have nothing to fear from tho pooling:(c).   The present specialisation of skilled labour for special work would not bo disturbed by pooling, because such * specialisation increases efficiencyand output - inceed, the policy of Buoh speoial &quot;$ronping&quot; of labour &apos;-ould be continued farther if possible.(b). (o).(a).(e).
(d) In &quot;pooling&quot;&apos; fckllleoVlabour, no Directorate would be denuded^ of its-full^ trained Units engaged on its Vpe*ilai, work nor would such Units be removed for other work in other Directorates of an entirely different character.(e) Under the power to pool, one Directorate would often be &quot;found to be of material assistance to ethers, without IoSb ofv-   efficiency,(f) It is conceivable that the effect of pooling on a very good Directorate would be nil, fcwing to its excellent management and control which would   -eliminate all waste of labour.(g) In any case, action taken under a possi-ble pooling of skilled labour would, of necessity, be slow and would probably only be after some improvement had been attempted with the unskilled labour, and after some relation between the two classes had been determined.   Relation betweenthe two classes of labour is actual, though it be not recognised, and it must imply the necessity of centralised control over bith skilled and unskilled.Controller   (.18).   The control of labour is centralised at G .H.Q.e,f Labour,   for unskilled labour only.   In General Order Ho. 3502 it is laid down that under a Controller of labour at G.H.Q,., specially appointed to act under the decisions - of the Quartermaster General as to allocation, the unskilled labour shall be supervised and controlled in certain definite terms.   No real control, however, appears to have been given or exercised, and certainly no control is implied such as would be instituted over civil workmen.   The main functions of the Controller of  abour appear to rest upon &quot;direct liaison&quot; - a phrase which is emphasised in the General order referred to.The Controller acts under the quarter-Master General, who has pawer to allot labour after priority has been settled by the chief of staff.With regard to the release of labour allocated, forecast of requirements, criticism as to efficiency of labour employed, etc., the Controller of labour acts after consultation with H.Q. Armies and L. of C., D.G.T.. and Directorates, &amp;c, who obviously can enforce their views, as they are, in effect, in contiel of the labour while employed by them.The work of control is really liaison, and as such carries with it no   power of enforcing decisions or suggested methods of economy with regard to the utili-sation of labour.   The Controller has no power to re-trganise the labour upon specific work with his own Staff. His power consists of criticism, which, owing to diffi-culties which are obvious, is only tentatively exercised. The status of his administration absolutely precludes the possibility of enforcing his wishes, should they be in direct opposition to the opinions and wishes of the Directorates.    He is given &quot;facilities&quot; /
to visit constructional and maintenance workfl /vVprlcsJobtB stores and depots, where unskilled labour xrom tno general pool is employed, but he is expressly precluded from inter-iereneeof any kind with the labour of skilled or specialism!. Units,It is impossible to see how a Controller with suoh limited powers can postulate a criticism of any work, when his power of criticism can only apply to the unskilled labour upon such work, particularly when such labour when allotted is in reality actually withdrawn from his control and is under the supreme direction of Headquarters Armies or Headquarters Linos of Communication, D.G.T. and Directorates.The Controller&apos; of Labour has further to- consult tho Advisor Indian Labour, the Advisor Alien Labour, and Staff Officer S.A.I.L.C.     In order actually to control the labour, which is apparently his suggested function, these Officers should be under him and act as members of Iris Staff whom ho could consult when he thought it necessary to attempt to increase the efficiency of the labour for which they acted as Advisors. * &quot;The Army Labour Commandants, the. Corps Labour Commandants Deputy Controllers of Labour Headquarters L. of C Areas, Area Commandants, and Assistant Controllers of Labour, are all under Army Headquarters, and Headquarters Lines of Communication, and are not in any way under the Controller of Labour.    Hisfunction with these Officers can merely bo called &quot;direct liaison&quot; and one wherein he can simply make suggestions as to any alterations which he may deem desirable and necessary to increase the efficient and economical use of the labour.The functions of the Controller, limited as they are, have doubtless exercised a beneficial influence, more perhaps as a result of liaison work than by the exercise of any power directly delegated to him by G.H.He has no power whatever to criticise, reflect upon,.: or advise as to the scheme of works, or the expense of the same as labour-soaks, or what he may.consider unnecessary cost owing to excessive v/ork included in the design. .  He can enter Army and Corps areas, and&apos; Lines of Oonmiuni cation arose-, not as a Controller, but as an Inspection  Authority, with permission to make suoh criticisms as he deems desirable. He apparently does not.exercise this function in Divisional areas unless some of the unskilled labour pool is allocated by Army Headquarters to such aroas.It is obvious from this rou&quot;-;h summary that his powors as Controller of Labour are very definitely limited, nor is it thought that it would bo- possible,&apos; under such authority as he may have, to increase materially the efficiency   of the-labour in the unskilled 1, hour pool.1vision - to bo mainly drawn from fighting forces..   This labour-apparently works very unsatisfactorily, largely owin;T to the fact that:it resents the necessity for undertaking work when it considers its functions to be those of lighting.
Further, tho work dotio by such labour is often wasted by the shifting of Divisions, the incoming new Division starting new works which frequently include the scrapping -of.what was.previously done by the old division.    This difficulty might be overcome it it were possible to form Works Pi one or &quot;Companies for work in the Division areas; the Pioneer--Companies being left to complete cay work for the -incoming Division in that area when the Division is shifted.Worksr (20),    The scheme of el 1 works, etc., and the adminis-&quot;jjjffieiae    tration,of works services, stores and depots, remain &apos;&apos;of.^ &apos;u&apos;    under the Directorates, D.c.T., etc.    Ko independent cen-tralised control for these is exercised by the Chiefof Staff, or controller of labour.    As a result of this lack of centralised control, costly and unnecessary works, at times, must undoubtedly be undertaken.    One instance of this which might be quoted was seen near Poporinghe, where a bridge and incline causeways, together with the switch ; approaches thereto, had been built over a railway to save delay at the level crossing.     it is understood that approxt mately  1,000 men were engaged upon this work for a month, but no evidence exists that the bridge, etc., have been of any,use whatever.    Bxeessive and unreasonable demands upon labour caused by such works cannot be controlled under the present system unless there exists a centralised control at G.H.q,What the (81).    Apparently the view taken in France is that,jtotjcig the Unit for works of any size is a Unit of unskilledlabour;   tho view suggested, however, ;is thcfc the   Unit is larger than this, and is, in effeot, the specific work or service required, which would include the provision of unskilled and skilled labours its supervision^ record of efficiency, control ox material and means of transport for the full and economical use of same,by that labour, and some control of. the character of the work upon which the labour is engaged.    control is entirely illusory unless the factors essential-to the successful prosecution of tho work are focussed in one central authority.    The difficulty of giving such centralised control for works ,;nd services in the Army gones in france is realised, but no civilian organ!-%er could be expected to attempt to deal with the various questions without a revision of the organisation somewhat upon the above lines.Insuf- (22)    So   far as the information obtained and^eficiency above observations go, it would ,appear that, in any oa^e^ the,;labour,, ever if efficiently employed throughout,, is&apos; still insufficient for the.needs of the Armies&quot;in,France. There is,- at the moment, apparently little chance of increasing the number 01 Labour Units from England, while, it is understood that the Gerge Colony Labour and tho Indian and South African Native Labour is to be repatriate^-.    In view of this serious contemplated reduction in the ^mpply of labour for the urgent, works of the future, the necessity for.increase of efficiency in the labour available wou3$ appear to be vital.    Even-a. smsl 1:increase with such    , numbers would be of material benefit to the works beihfe -carried out  or the Armies.  - *
The quality of the labour in the unskilled labour pool generally is bo low, and its conscious action in withholding a pro-portion of its normal labour service eo definite, owing to the system of management and control prevailing over a period of years, that immediate increase of efficiency and output may not be anticipated.     An organisation, however, directed solely to that, end, should, without question, materially increase its morale and efficiency in a period of some months.It might be possible to increase the effective numbers of unskilled labour by rigidly combing out the Area Employment Companies.    A number of men who would increase the effective pool of unskilled labour might thereby be obtained.ervisinff Unit.(23).      The most important necessity, however, would appear to be the recruitment of special Companies of working labour supervisors, sueh as gangers and foremen, thoroughly familiar with the practical control and organisation of labour ** men who have come from the labour ranks themselves, and. who by energy and individual initiative have been enabled to rise to positions of authority.If such Superior or Foremen Labour Companies could be recruited and held under the practical control of the Authority dealing with labour, they could be moved about upon specific works-as required., arid given definite instructions to plan out and increase the efficiency of labour in every possible way.     Their civilian experience, gained by working under Contractors who would not have employed them unless they had shown marked efficiency as tradesmen, and a capacity for control of men, would, it is thought, be invaluable to the Controlling Authority.ommendations.(24).      (l)     That in order to render effective thecontrol oflabour, complete independence of Directorates, &quot;Employers&quot; bf Labour, etc., should be granted to the Officer charged with such control.(2).   That authority for exercising the functions of complete control should proceed direct from the Chief of. Staff, upon whose instructions as to priority and urgnncy all work is undertaken.(3)     7hat there should be full control of all skilled and unskilled labour, of all categories.   Some concessions might, perhaps, be granted in regard to the minimum maintenance staff on certain works and the minimum staff for special works where the labour employed is constant and highly trained.    Even here, the Controller or Director of Labour should, under- the Chief of Staff, have full right of veto.(4)    That there should be the power of criticise and, if necessary, the right of veto on design of works and lay-outs, and on the management of Stores and Depots and of workshop methods where doubtful economy in design or uneconomical use of labour has been noted,(J?)     That direct liaison with the officials of the Admiralty should be effected in regard to the use of labour at the base norts.
&apos; Mm2134(6),    That there) should he provided an adequate and efficient Administrative, Executive and Supervising Staff,: recruited from trained men, so far as is possible, and employed at Headquarters, which should he placed in the position best suited to the Supervision of all works, etc.(7).     The or Controller.,t adequate rank be granted to, the DirectorConclus-Icn.(25). . How far military organisation, and the necessities caused by the repeatedly changing situation in France&apos;,, would allow of the acceptance of these recommendations, has not been considered.     The question has been looked at solely from the point of view of suggesting such a re-r organisation as shall, if possible, meet the serious deficiency in the quality of labour by a sound utilisation and distribution of the labour actually available and by using methods accepted in sound practice by Civil Engineers and organisers of labour on a large scale*The difficulties in the.way of such a reorganisation are realised; but in view of the immensity of the problem it would seem of the highest importance that&apos; such a vital . question, upon which comment has already been passed in. this Country, should be dealt with on the broadest lines, and on the,basis of the experience and of the methods which have.stood the test of practice.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, .(Signed), BAIIJES.,.
