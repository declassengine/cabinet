,.-./&apos;7     , Printed for the use of the War Cabinet.   July 1918. SKOKKT.GOAL    IRON ORE.THIS matter requires a decision. The choice lies between using BOO coal-miners to get 150,000 tons of coal in a year or transferring them to the Cumberland and Cleveland iron-ore mines to get approximately 400,000 tons of iron ore. I consider that the transfer is highly profitable from the point of view of war-power. Considering the cost and risk of bringing ore by sea, everything that can develop the home supply and reduce the demands on shipping is of the greatest value. We cannot do anything without iron and steel. On the other hand, I am well aware of the labour stringency on the coal-lields.If the War Cabinet do not wish to go into the pros and cons themselves, 1 suggest that the matter should be relegated to the War Cabinet Priorities Committee, which is very well equipped and informed to balance and decide upon the arguments.The matter is urgent.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.July 14, 1918.Thfi position arising in the Cumberland and Cleveland iron-ore mines as a result of the calling-up to the Colours of men born in the years 1898 and 1899, is submitted for the attention of the War Cabinet: 1. The number of men of the above ages called-up under the &quot;clean cut &quot;is approximately 260 in the Cumberland mines, and 250 in the Cleveland mines.2.. It is estimated that the total loss of output will be from 2,000 to 2,500 tons per week of hematite ore in the Cumberland district, and 6,000 tons per week in the Cleveland district. This is equivalent, to a total annual loss of 104,000 to 130,000 tons in Cumberland, and 312,000 tons in Cleveland, in all 416,000 to 442,000 tons.3. The experience of the past year has shown that it is. only from the coal-fields that suitable labour can be found to fill the gaps in the iron-ore mines. Recently provision was made by the Minister of National Service for transferring a number of colliers from the Scotch coal-fields to Cumberland. Of the total number so transferred approximately one-half went back to the coal-fields ; but there was a clear gain of approximately 250 men.4. It would appear that the position in the coal-fields is less favourable to the transfer of labour to the iron-ore mines than at the time when the Scotch miners were recruited for Cumberland, inasmuch as the coal-mines themselves have been heavily depleted by the calling-up of miners to the Colours, while the demands upon the output of coal for munition purposes are steadily increasing.5. It would seem that the loss of this large quantity of iron-ore is unavoidable unless provision can be made for the transfer of approximately 600 men from the coal-fields to iron-ore mines. Taking the average output per annum of the collier at 246 tons per man, the figure given for the year 1917, this would involve a to^al loss of 147,600 tons of coal per annum. It is assumed that the number of colliers required would, owing to their unfamiliarity with the conditions of work, be somewhat in excess of the number of iron-ore miners to be replaced.6. The question resolves itself into a decision between the relative importance of the loss of approximately 400,000 tons of iron ore or approximately 150,000 tons of coal.7.. It is suggested that the loss of output of iron ore is far more serious than the comparatively trivial loss of coal, and that the Minister of National Service and the Coal Controller should negotiate with the Miners&apos; Federation and the coal-owners for the transfer from the Durham coal-fields of a sufficient number of coal-miners to compensate for the loss of the iron-ore miners who have recently been called to the Colours.o617 i[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]
