BATTLE SITUATION - NOON - 21st JULY, 1918.

1. WESTERN FRONT.

Between REIMS and CHATEAU THIERRY the French now hold the line of the MARNE as far as REUIL-SUR-MARNE. From REUIL to BOUILLY fierce fighting is taking place and strong enemy counter-attacks appear to have regained some of the ground taken yesterday by British troops.
