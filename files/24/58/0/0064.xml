, a - 166SUMMARY Qg BLOCKADE IlfffORMATIQI July 12th - 18th, 1918.jffiMARJC.   The German Government still deoline to approve the oession to the Allies of more than 400,000 tons of Danish shipping, and the Associated Governments will not accept less than 465,000 tons.    The present deadlock accordingly seems likely to oontinue indefinitely. Danish vessels sailing between neutral ports are at present allowed German safe-conducts provided they oarry no enemy passengers and give no undertaking that none of the oargo carried will be re-export-ed from the country of destination.The Germans in their negotiations for a renewal of the German Danish Eoonomio Agreement are pressing for (a) Danish fats in oom-pensation for German drugs and chemicals and (b) Danish horses in compensation for German raw materials required by the Danish Indus-tries, such as coal, iron, potash and soda.    BUM. Government are prepared to offer Denmark reasonable ouantities of the drugs and ohemicals which she is trying to obtain from Germany, and are en-quiring what supplies are likely to be needed.The Danes have already agreed to continue their exports of cattle to Germany at the old prices.     Germany, however, has agreed to pay increased prices for Danish butter;   namely, 400 crowns per cask up to September, 425 orowns in October, and 450 crowns in November.MAY. Government have concluded a contract with the NorwegianGovernment for the purchase by the Allies of the lorwegian surplus out-put of pyrites up to t e end of1919.The Norwegian factories working for the Allies fear that the lorwegian Authorities in distributing the raw materials imported into Norway under the Hew Agreement may neglect or postpone their applications and they are asking for special facilities to receive supplies outside the rations to which Norway is entitled.    Under
1672.the Agreement the Norwegian Government should assign to these fai-tories definite proportions of the raw materials imported in order that work for the Allies may not be impeded.     The United States War Trade Board propose to take the matter into their own hands and to issue special export licences for goods required by the Allied , firms and to charge these exports against the respective Norwegian rations.     The Norwegian Associations, however, are not bound to accept delivery of such materials and the Norwegian Government may refuse facilities for their diseharge.     Sir M. Findlay anticipates some difficulty in settling this question with the Norwegian Gov-ernment.    He will probably find it necessary to warn them that any obstruction in the delivery of supplies to the Allied factories will be regarded by the Associated Governments as a breach of the Agreement,- SWITZERLAND.     Owing to the criticisms of the S.S.S. in Italy andvarious difficulties which have arisen between the S.S.S. and the Allied Governments M. Grobet has formally enquired vshether H.M. Government desire the S.S.S. to continue their work and whether he should himself resign his activities as a director.   M. Grobet has been assured that h.M. Government would regard his withdrawl and the dissolution of the Society as a disaster.M. Grobet greatly resents the serious charges brought against the S.S.S. in Italy, especially as these charges have not yet been officially denied or substantiated by the Italian Government.   He is prepared to investigate any definite complaints brought against theagjents of the Society in Italy, but refuses to fidsmiss them on a general charge.     The S.S.S. are under the impression that 1heii      sampa^gn agfcinst them in Italy is designed to screen the ineffioien-ey off Italian control at the frontiers. ,&apos; The Italian Government are at present reorganising their blockade machinery.    We are urging them to direct their efforts chiefly towards formulating and administering a strong and consist-
ent blookade polioy as regards Switzerland.   Hitherto oonsiderable latitude has &quot;been left to the looal Italian Customs Offioers in the lioensing of Italian goods for Switzerland.    It is desirable that some central authority in Rome should be responsible for all Italian export lioenoes and should be independent of the other Italian Departments.     It should also work in olose fcouoh with the Allied organisations in Paris and Berne in oharge of Swiss questions.JAPAI.    The United States Government recently invited the Japanese Government to cooperate with the Allies in drawing up a Statutory List for Far Eastern countries.    The Japanese Government, who for a long time were reluctant to adopt the Statutory List polioy, have now accepted the invitation and have asked the United States Government to discuss the matter with H.M. Government.   Japanese participation in Statutory list Questions would presumably involve the attendance of Japanese representatives at the periodical Allied Statutory List Conferences at Vifashington, London and Paris9 and the Japanese Government may press for a special Conference at Tokio to compile and administer the lists for China and Slam.    The Dutch Bast Indies would be expressly excluded from any such arrange-ment as being a colony of Holland.EBBP.   The Peruvian Government are becoming anxious regarding the disposal of the Peruvian surplus of native cotton and sugar.    I.M. Government recently suggested that the remedy lay in their own hands and urged them in this connection to requisition the enemy ships in Peru.    The Peruvian Government now propose that H.M. Government should purchase the Peruvian surplus produce for ship-ment in the enemy vessels to the United Kingdom.    They are pre-pared to aooept part payment in cash or in Peruvian securities negotiated in London and to receive the balance after a period toI be agreed upon*
, BRAZIL.    Hitherto the Brazilian Enemy Trading Law has not applied to Gorman firms resident in Brazil and German property in Brazil is still untouched.    The Brazilian Government are anxious that we should with-draw the various Allied Statutory Lists for Brazil, hut we have had to inform them that the Lists oannot he withdrawn until they are themsel-ves prepared to take effective aotion for the suppression of German trade.    The Brazilian Ministers for Foreign Affairs and for Finanoe are &quot;both in favour of closing the German &quot;banks in Brazil and winding up firms with head offices in Germany, hut the President is unwilling to act without the concurrence of his successor, Dr. Rodrigues Alvez, who will &quot;become President on Ifovember 15th.    The Brazilian Government have recently complained that the embargoes and restrictions imposed by the United States Government on American trade with Brazil are hindering Brazil from contributing as much as she might to the Allied cause.    The United States Government have taken this opportunity to raise the whole question of the Brazilian economic policy.    They have invited the Brazilian Government to appoint representatives to discuss with the Allies at Washington how Brazilian interests may best be reconciled with the desire of the Brazilian Government to assist her Allies in prosecuting the war.1ERMAI SUBMARIIE BLOCKADE.
