London, S.W. 1.31st Hay, 1918.Sir,The Officer Commn&amp;in;;, 15th (Transport Workers1) Battalion South Lancashire Regiment reports to-day that he was informed &quot;by the Headquarters, Western Command on the 29th instant that a War office message had been received by that Command stating that men of the Transport Workers1 Battalions were not to be used to replace strikers without the sanction of the War Office.It will be within your recollection that the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions in regard to civilian employment have been placed by the Army Council under the control of this Committee.   Upon this Committee labour is very fully represented.The principle upon which this Committee is working is that help can only be obtained from the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions if the Committee, upon which organised labour is represented, certify that there is in fact a shortage of oivilian labour.   The circumstances under which such shortage arises is not under the; control of the Local Committee, as their duty is merely to provide such help as is needed to maintain the flow of traffic throu/^h the port.
Whenev^r^-there are stribes or the ahoTta^erlias arisen owing to labour di-spurtes-every-^tjare is taken by this Co-minittee not to prejudice the rights of eithfrmaixle by supplying help from the Transport workers&apos; Battalions, but it would be impo.ss.i*-ble for this Committee to discharge the duties imposed upon it if it were precluded from providing help mfiwely on the .   ground that the.flow of traffic throuijh a port was impeded by reason of a strike.In the circumstances the Committee trust that the arrange-ments that have hitherto been in operation as to this Committee having full control over the   Battalions upon all points relating to their civilian employment will not be disturbed, and that the Command may be advised accordingly.I amSir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)   ......Secretary.The Secretary,War Office, S.W. 1.(ii)Copy of letter from Secretary, War Office to Secretary, Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee.War Office,London, S.W. 1.120/General No./8302.(A.G.3.) . ,19th June, 1918.Sir,In reply to your communication of the 31st ultimo, 1 am commanded by the Army Council to.inform you that the instruct tions to which reference is made in the first paragraph.of your letter under reply were issued in conformity with the general rules regarding the employment of troops to replace civilian employees on strike^    These instructions require that before any soldiers are so.employed, reference must be made by the Military Authorities of the Command&apos;to the Commander-in-Chief, the Forces in Great Britain, who will take the directions Cf the Army Council on the matter, such directions being issued under the approval of the Prime Minister.Under the circumstances the Army Council regret that, they are unable to take any action in the matter.I amSir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)

(til).illCopy of letter from Chariman, port fc Transit Executive Committee to^Sccretary,&apos; War Cabinet.Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee Ministry of Shipping, St. James&apos;s park, S.W. 1.21st June, 1918.Dear Colonel Hankey,I am sorry to. trouble you, but the enclosed correspon-dence with the War Office raises a point of vital importance to the work of this Committee.The question is whether the general prohibition that, I gather, has been&apos;, Issued against the employment of soldiers in the case of a strike applies to the men of the Transport workers&apos; Battalions., It is one thing to employ soldiers as strike breakers, and the men of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions ha-ve never been &quot;used for that purpose.It is another&apos;thing to use the Battalions to maintain the flow of traffic, through .a port, altho&apos; sections of the dock workers in that port, for reasons which appear to themselves &apos;to be valid, withhold their work.   The men of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions have again and again been used for that purpose, and in my judgment this Committee must have authority to so use them if it is &apos;to discharge the duties imposed upon- it.    : ;......:1We have now six Labour representatives on this Committee, namely, Mr. Harry Gosling, Mr. Ben Tillett, Ir. J.H. Thomas, Mr. E. Bevin, Mr. James Sexton, and Mr. Robert Williams.Eor each port and for each railway centre we have a Local Committee, and upon each of those Local Committees we have a representative of organised Labour. -No man .jf the Battalions is employed without the pre-vious consent of the Local Committee for the district, and we, , here, on the. Central Committee, review week by week the work upon which the men are employed.The men of the Battalions have now put in upwards of : 3,000,000 days work, and we have not had one single dispute with organised Labour.Our work becomes more and more difficult as the Convoy system is developed, and as more men are taken into the Army.The Army Council, under the arrangement approved by the Cabinet in January, 1916, placed the men of the Battalions, so far as concerned their civil employment, at the disposal of the Committee.I would submit that we have justified the confidence shown to us and that the general institution to which I have referred should not be extendod to tho men of thotransport Workers1 Battalions.v -. &quot;lours faithfully,.       - (Signed)* NORMAN HILL.Chairman,Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, E.C.B, Secretary,War Cabinet, S,W,1.

The Civilian labour ceased work because they were not satisifed with the Award made by the Committee of production.The Labour Leaders on this Committee are quite clear that any questions arising on the National Award must be referred back to ^the Committee of production, and that in the meantime, the men must keep at work, it having been clearly established that the rulings of the Committee of Production will date back to the original Avard.The aotion of the War Office weakens the authoruty of a&amp;l concerned in maintaining the flow of essential traffic through the ports.Yours sincerely,(signed)   N03HAN HILLColonel Sir Maurioe Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary, War Cabinet,2,.

corespondence. .The difficulties will he remtrved ,if the prime Minister will&apos;1 approve of its &quot;being left to this Committee, acting on the advice of its Looal committees (upon all of which the laheur. Unions are represented), to determine whether there is such a deficiency of civilian labour as to justify the calling in of assistance from the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions in order that the flow of essential traffic may be maintained, but always cn the understanding that the Battalions will not be employed by-the Committee for thepurpose of &quot;strike   breaking&quot;.Thesye are the lines upon which we have worked from the start with the full support of the Labour Leaders on the Committee.On these lines the officers Commanding the Battalions will continue to act on the instructions of our Local Committees, upon whom (subject to the control of thi3 Committee) will remain the responsibility for carrying out our policy as above defined.Yours sincerely, &apos; (signed)   NORMAN HILLColonel Sir Maurice Hankey, K.C.B., Seoretary,FAB CABINET,2, Whitehall Gardens..(Tl)(Copy of letter from-Mr. creedy, to Secretary,, War Cabinet.)War Office, Whitehall... , ... S.W. 115th July, 1918.My dear Hankey,,you sent me on the 24th June some correspondence from Sir Norman Hill on the subject of the employment of soldiers in the case of a strike.     The A.G., L.P.S. and Lord Stanhope have discussed the matter with Sir Norman Hill. It seemdd clear to us that these men have not and will not be used under circumstances where a strike, as we  understand it in the proper sense of the torn, is in progress.   Sir Norman explained t.a us that what he really deals with is the purely temporary, sporadic, and unauthorised individual and collective abstention from, work which occurs from time to time in the docks. He also mentioned that he woftld not think of using the men as black-legs in:the&apos;event of an authorised strike where the proper procedure by strikers has been followed, e.g. tendering of notices, etc,, eto.,     The Adjutant General suggested to Sir Norman that if the prime Minister agreed to his proposals we should be quite content and would-withdraw the restrictions
hitherto issued by the War Office and it was arranged that I should write to you in this sense.

Yours ever,
