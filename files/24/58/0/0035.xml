^   -war cabinet.   &apos; \ 2.----------- 94t 1 &apos;prisoners op war.^V&apos;      MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY OK MISS -dm    , t      - VULLIAMY S STATEMENT (G.T.5083).The statements by Mies Vulliamy, whoso admirable work in Holland among our prisoners of war is well known, oarry great weight;   and they are oonfirmed by the report of Mr. Justioe Younger&apos;s Committee and by what I heard at the Hague.The British Delegates at the Hague lodged formal complaints as to the treatment of British prisoners of war in some of the camps, in the mines (especially salt mines) and behind the lines;   and these oomplaints will form part of the records of the Conference and will be available for future reference. The German Delegates while deolining to admit the facts promised enquiry.With regard to Miss Vulliamyfs&quot;suggestions&quot; I add the following remarks:-1. It was agreed before I left the Hague that 15,000 privates on each side, as well as some of the older prisoners, should be exchanged before any officer or non-oommissioned officer was repatriated.    I have no doubt that this pro-vision, although not mentioned in the telegram from the Delegates, is included in the agreement.    This will have the effeot whioh Miss Vulliamy desires.2, 3 and 4. The agreement provides for all these matters.5. This may be right; but it should be remembered (l) that the agreement has not yet been ratified and (2) that retaliation on German officers will lead to oounter retaliation on the British prisoners of war in Germany.6* This appears to be right.7. This will certainly be necessary if the prisoners are to remain in Holland.8. Unless arrangements oan be made for leave, I strongly urge that women should be sent to Holland in greater numbers.    The present arrangement involves great hardship on the married officers and non-oommissioned officers who are . there.i   /16th July, 1918. Vj.
