REINFORCEMENT OF RESERVES BEHIND BRITISH FRONT BY AMERICAN TROOPS.

Copy of letter dated 13th July, 1918, from the Prime Minister to M. Clemenceau, (See Imperial War Cabinet Minute 2).

(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister).

The Imperial War Cabinet have been examining the military situation on the Western front on reports which have been received from our Military Chiefs in France and our Military advisers here. They have brought to our notice a good deal of evidence pointing to the probability of an early and very heavy attack on this sector.

Among these indications I may mention the concentration on the British Front of 88 out of a total of 100 German batteries which have been traced during the last six weeks on their way to the Western front from the East; a recent reinforcement of heavy artillery in the region of Kemmel; a very considerable increase in the number of telegraph and telephone and other engineer units opposite the British front; the passage of a large number of trains crowded with men returning from furlough, whereas the trains returning to Germany are reported to be empty; intensive training particularly of the German machine gun units and other signs similar to those which preceded the attack of March 21st.

In view of indications on other sectors of the Western Front, this evidence is possibly not conclusive as to the certainty of the brunt of the attack falling on our sector, but some of the evidence - more particularly the concentration of artillery  - points clearly to a very great enemy effort on the British front and those responsible for the government of the autonomous states composing the British Empire feel bound to satisfy themselves that no precaution has been neglected to provide for this eventuality.

We are further advised that if the Germans were to concentrate the whole of their strength on the British front they could in the immediate future assemble 100 to 110 divisions (including the divisions normally holding the line on the front of attack) with which they might attack on a front of from 80 to 100 kilometres the calculations allowing for two separate waves of attack. To meet such an attack the British Army with the five American divisions now training behind our front could muster on the same front a total of 45 divisions including of course the divisions holding the line opposite the front of attack. After the exhaustion of the reserve of 20 divisions, included in the figure of 45 divisions, General-in-Chief f? would be dependent on the French and American divisions, all of which (with the exception of the 5 American divisions training with us) since the withdrawal of the D.A.N. are south of the Somme.

An
An examination of the position has caused the gravest anxiety in the minds of all the members of the Imperial War Cabinet and they have formed the strong opinion that the reserves behind the British sector of the front ought to be  immediately reinforced by a much larger proportion of the American troops brought to France during the last two or three months

We have accordingly instructed General Sir Henry Wilson to make strong representations to the Allied General-in-Chief on the subject and my colleagues have asked no to write to you in order to invite your support to this proposal. We have scraped every available man from the United Kingdom and the Dominions are sending across all the drafts they can dispose of. There is therefore nothing more that can be done here until the new crop, called up from April onwards, is ready; that is a matter of at least six weeks as far as any substantial numbers are concerned.

The Imperia1 War Cabinet have not lost sight of the political importance to the Allies as a whole, and to the French nation in particular, of averting all danger to Paris. For this reason we make no criticism of the withdrawal of the D.A.N. from the Northern part of the line nor of the other measures taken by General Foch to reinforce the armies covering Paris. At the same time we feel that there are very special reasons for strengthening the Northern sector of the front in the manner I have suggested particularly in view of the indications of a probable attack already referred to. No one has more fully realised than General Foch that as General-in-Chief he is responsible not only for French interests but for these of the whole of the Allies fighting on the Western Front.

I need hardly recall to you such considerations as we have so often discussed together -: the importance of the Northern ports both as the pivot of our anti-submarine system of defence and as bases of supply, for the overseas portion of the Allied armies; the narrow manoeuvring space available between the enemy lines and the sea which renders it dangerous to cede ground at any point in the Northern sector; the danger lost the communications between the British and French armies should be severed; most vital of all, the importance of not creating an impression in the British Empire that their armies have been let down by the united command.  To these considerations must be added the unknown factor as to whether the Belgian Army can be relied upon to sustain a serious attack. General Foch himself, has always been anxious about this and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig has recently told me that in his opinion one or two thoroughly reliable divisions ought always to be available in reserve in the region of Dunkirk to reinforce the Belgian Army in case of emergency.

Apart from the above considerations, however, the Imperial War Cabinet feel that we have special claim to urge that additional American divisions should be trained behind our lines owing to the fact that the bulk of the American effectives transported to France in the last few months have been brought in British tonnage. The enormous number of American troops that have reached France would not be there but for the special effort made by the British Minister of Shipping. The figures are as follows :-

See copy of letter attached.
Honth                       Numbers brought in Total in all pita sh Binjpptnp;. Shipping.Hay                                 147,780 244,34-5June                              1^6,940 276,372July (estimated)              200,000 320,000504,720 840,717The total carried since March 1st in British ships is 582,531.    Yet only 100,000 are now training behind the British lines, that is about one-sixth of the numbers carried in British ships alone since March 1st, the rest being in the main behind the French lines.These figures speak for themselves.    This feat of transportation has only been accomplished by means of an anprecedented effort and great sacrifice on the part not only of the United Kingdom but of tho whole of the British Empire. The Imperial War Cabinet feel strongly that it entitlos us to &apos; a very special consideration in tho allotment of the American reserves.    By the end of tho month I am informed the Infantry and Machine Gunners of not less than 30 American divisions should be in France.    Of these, if the present distribution is maintained, there will be 25 behind the French lines and only 5 incomplete behind our Unas.    This is indefensible.As you are aware* the German reserves aro so placed that they could concentrate the bulk of them at very short notice in ah attack on the British front.Should the British forces be overwhelmed by superior -numbers there would be a feeling here which I should find difficult to resist that the Ganoral-in-Chief in his distribution of the American forces has leaned much too heavily in favour of support for the French armies.    Having regard to the difficulties which I encountered here in      , securing unity of command and placing the British Army.under a French General-in-Chief (in fact, as you know, I placed the life of the Government &quot;in considerable jeopardy in my efforts to secure unity of command) I know that you will agree with me  hat this would.be very unfortunate.     It would undoubtedly be fatal to the continuance of the arrangement.For these reasons the Imperial Cabinet have  ... requested me to represent that in their judgment a very much larger proportion of the masses of American troops that have been brought to France should be placed &quot;behind the British line so as to toe available to be thrown in in the event of a great German attack succeeding in temporarily breaking the line.     I invite you to associate with me in urging this upon General Foch and General Pershing.I have not written to General Perehing direct on the subject nor have I communicated with the American authorities as I do not wish to interfere with the funotione of the General-in-Chief.    I am, however, sending a copy of this fetter to General Foch.
ENCLOSURE TO G.T. 5116.Copy of a letter dated 18th July, 1916, from the Chief. of the Imperial General Staff to Generaisin-Chief Foch.My dear Friend,With the withdrawal of the D.A.N. the 2nd Army has obviously &quot;become much weaker.   It ia true that wo have three American divisions getting ready to take the place of your six divisions but these divisions have no artillery, either field or heavy, and therefore the loas of the -artillery of the D.A.N. is a serious source of weakness even though wo have strengthened the 2nd Army by gunB of the IX Corps.   All this of course you know, and no doubt are taking steps to meet, but the War Cabinet desire me to write and bring the matter promin-cntly to your notice, as in view of thfc preparations made by the enemy on the British front they are naturally anxious that no pt3sible steps should be overlooked which might add to tho security of our front.   Our calculations here - and theso I think in the main agree with yours - show that the Bochcs had, en March 21st, 82 fresh divisions outride the line, available for attack.   To-day, July 11th, our estimate is that there are only 63 fresh Bocho divisions available but we calculate that, by July 3oth, if there is no heavy fighting in the meantime, the enemy will have 85 fre3h divisions available.   Those 85 added to the divisions on tho front of attack would allow of an attaok being made on an 80 kilometre front.   Thi3 is a serious affair especially if the whole of this attack were to fall on the British front, and it sooms to me that our (British) position would be greatly strengthened if another rive American divisions were training behind our lines, as was originally intended, instead of training behind tho Vosges and in the peace camps of Mailly etc.   It sooms to the War Cabinet that no troops or guns should bo allowed to lie idle in any part of our theatre and I know well how you agree in this sentiment.   The Field-Marshal told me this morning that General Pershing proposed to send him the ^un3 and personnel (except a few batteries) of four divisions during the month of August.   This is ;.:ood but in view of the fact that if the Boches attack at all they aro sure to attack before wo are much older could not this movement of guns and personnel be made now?   And in addition could not General porshing send up to our area the personnel to man some heavy artillery batteries ?   These men could carry out their practice and training against live Bocheo instead of against inanimate targets at Mailly and other camps and could then rejoin General Porshing^ Command when the 2nd Army is, in his opinion, trained and ripe for movement.The Fit. Id-Marshal ha 3 still got some heavy gunn 6M and upward for whioh he haa no personnel and which could be put in the line if he could obtain the American gunners.It seems a terrible waoto of power to have these guns behind our lines without any nun to servo them and on tho other hand to have American personnel practising on ranges within 400 kilometres of them.
The War Cabinet is proud to think and to know that you are as much their Commander-in-Chief as the Commandor-in-Chief of the French and of the Americans and it is in that capacity that I write you this loiter.Bvor your Friend.(Sgd.)   HMRI. .8* - At the Prime Minister&apos;s request I enclose a copy of a letter which he has sent to-day to K* Clfcucnoeau.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 15th July, 1918.
