north sea.operations (other than anti-submarine) carried out by aircraft duringapril, 1918.yarmouth, april 13th.-Large America Seaplane No. 4233, (Capt. Livock and Capt. Leckie) proceeded at 0528 on an Anti-Zeppelin patrol. At 0655 a Zeppelin was sighted about 10 miles on the starboard bow flying at a height of 6000 ft. steering East. On sighting the Large America the Zeppelin imme-diately descended into a thick bank of cloud and all efforts again to locate her failed. She was travelling at a normal rate of speed and did not show any signs of distress. The Large America returned to base at 0950.felixstowe, april 25th.-Large America Seaplane No. 4284 (Pilots Capt. Young and Capt. Tees) went on patrol at 1550 in company with Large America 8677. At 1653 seven enemy seaplanes were seen approaching on the port bow. The Large Americas were at approximately 800 ft. and both machines simul-taneously turned left and dived to attack the enemy machines at very close range, No. 8677 passed over No. 4284 on the turn when the latter observed that the former had dived to within 100 ft. of the water and was a short distance ahead steering West at full speed. No. 4284 opened her engines full out and gradually drew abreast and on the starboard side of 8677. The two machines kept abreast and very close together fighting the enemy machines with their rear guns. After flying very low in this formation for about four minutes, at approximately 75 knots, No. 8677 dropped a little astern and No. 4284 throttled down to 70 knots to enable her to get abreast. As she did not catch up No. 4284 still further throttled down and also reduced ground speed by climbing. At 1703 No. 8677, which was about 90 to 100 yards on the port quarter of 4284, was observed to turn to port and immediately burst into flames and completely disappear under water.The enemy machines continued to attack, and being faster than No. 4284 the latter opened full out, dropped her bombs, and descended to 50 feet.  At 1708 when by Outer Gabbard Buoy the enemy turned East and No. 4284 returned to Felixstowe. No signals were received from or sent to No. 8677 after : sighting the enemy.The enemy machines were fast single and two-seaters, the total number of which could not be ascertained until they were all attacking the Large \ Americas in the rear.   It is not considered that their number was decreased when the Large Americas made their initial diving attack, although the enemy machine on which the fire of the Large Americas&apos; forward guns was I concentrated at very close range, banked steeply away and was lost to view.felixstowe, april 26th. Large America 8683 (1st Pilot Act. Capt. C. j MacLaurin, 2nd Pilot Hon. Capt. R. F. L. Dickey) at 2000 proceeded, as \ ordered, to the North Hinder Light Vessel to search the area in the direction of Zeebrugge for German Destroyers and to attack same if encountered.The weather conditions were good, clear sky, moonlight, calm sea and a very slight breeze from the N.E.The North Hinder was reached at 2105 when a course of 1350 was steered-Schouen Bank Light being sighted at 2140. After circling the latter a fewr times course was changed to 280o which was kept for 25 minutes.At 2205 course was again changed to the direction of Zeebrugge. At 2230 firing was observed ahead. The Seaplane was then flying at 800 ft. just; clear of a thin layer of mist which seriously interrupted observation. The course was continued until 2240 when it was considered that the Seaplane was! directly over Zeebrugge where a heavy barrage of &quot; flaming onions &quot; was put: up. The Seaplane fired several Very&apos;s lights without effect, circled, andl climbed to 1600 ft. 1 iThe barrage continued very effectively, the Seaplane therefore steered! west and at 2248 got clear of the fire zone, a course of 3100 being then taken.;
is&apos;!oiI a :d8IjAti uswas put anceredken.At 2335 a light was sighted on the port quarter. This was investigated and found to be a lightship which owing to very poor visibility and the disposition of ships lying in the vicinity was taken to be the Ship wash. A course of 270&quot; was then steered. Fog was now very thick and it was impossible to distinguish land from water at a height of 400 ft. About half-an-hour later the seaplane was heavily engaged by anti-aircraft defences. The remaining recognition Very light was fired and the recognition signal flashed on the Aldis lamp but fire continued uninterruptedly. Course was changed to the Eastward and shortly after leaving the fire zone a ship was sighted. The seaplane circled the ship once, flashing the recognition signal, then landed. Aldis lamp communica-tion was established and the seaplane finding that she was at the mouth of the river &quot; Crouch &quot; got off and proceeded N.E. at a height of 200 ft. A few minutes later the seaplane flew very close to a ship. Recognition signals were flashed to same but it immediately opened fire on the seaplane. Shortly afterwards the coast was picked up at Clacton and followed to within a few miles of Harwich where the seaplane was caught in the beam of two searchlights, to avoid which the seaplane turned East and being unsuccessful in again picking up the coast landed in Dovercourt Bay at 0135 and taxied towards the seaplane station, where the seaplane was taken in tow by a Motor Boat.ROYAL AIR FORCE,No. 5 Group, Dover Patrol, April 1st to 30th, inclusive.WEATHER.On many days during this period the weather has been unfavourable for flyings. A fair amount of flying has, nevertheless, been carried out.RECONNAISSANCE.A number of W/T Coastal reconnaissances were carried out during the month of April.On April 24th, No. 202 Squadron, over Ostende at 1820, reported a dense smoke screen S.W. of Pare de Leopold and two cruisers beached, three-quarters to one mile E. of Piers, one facing N. and S. and the other E. and W. about r 50 yards apart. On April 25th, two large vessels were reported broadside on e in entrance to Chenal d&apos;Acces, Zeebrugge, and the position of beached ships d    off Ostende, reported on April 24th, was confirmed.c A reconnaissance of the enemy&apos;s lines from Westende to Dixmude wascarried out on April 19th by No. 202 Squadron. &apos;PHOTOGRAPHIC RECONNAISSANCE. ,No. 202 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 1st. One photographic reconnaissance was carried out, but no plates were exposed.April 3rd. One photographic reconnaissance was carried out, and two plates exposed over tip of Mole.April 7th. Two special photographic reconnaissances were carried out over Zeebrugge Mole. Seven plates were exposed over tip of Mole, at 13,000 feet, with very satisfactory results.April 20th. During a photographic reconnaissance, fourteen plates were exposed over Zeebrugge Mole and vicinity,  tyj       April 21st. A photographic reconnaissance of Blankenberghe and Bruges was attempted, but heavy clouds prevented exposures.April 22nd. A photographic reconnaissance was carried out over &quot; Floods&quot; on the Dunkirk side of the lines, and thirty-six plates were exposed. An attempted reconnaissance over the lines was unsuccessful owing to heavy clouds,A2
April 33rd. Sixteen plates were exposed over Zeebrugge Mole and vicinity, in spite of unfavourable weather conditions.April &apos;25th. Four photographic reconnaissances were carried out. Thirty-six plates were exposed over Ostende Harbour and Dock, and vessels beached outside, Turkijen, Jacobynessen, Hindenburg, Tirpitz, Aachen, Antwerpen, Baescher and St. Cecilie Batteries and Ostende Seaplane Base, with good results. Sixteen plates were exposed over Bruges Docks, Zeebrugge Lock Gates, Harbour and Base of Mole, with good results. Thirty-five plates were exposed over floods on North side of Bergues-St. Omer Canal.Very heavy and accurate A.A, fire was experienced over Bruges. One of our machines was badly hit, but the pilot carried on and returned safely.ATTACKS ON ENEMY DESTROYERS, SHIPPING, AIRCRAFT, AND OTHER OBJECTIVES.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 1st. A D.H. 4 aeroplane (Capt. Lusk and Lieut. Picken) on special mission attacked a flotilla leader and three destroyers 10 miles N.E. of Ostende. Two 230-lb. bombs were dropped on the leader, the second of which fell on the deck amidships and a large amount of smoke observed at once to issue from the vessel. When last seen-the vessel was smoking heavily.A second machine dropped two 230-lb. bombs close to some T.B.D.S. A.A. fire from the destroyers was heavy.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 1st. A formation of three Camels sighted three enemy destroyers five miles N.W. of Zeebrugge, and immediately above them two single-seater seaplanes and one two-seater seaplane at 1000 feet. The enemy aircraft were allowed to proceed seawards and were then engaged. Lieut. Cooper drove the two-seater down in flames. Lieuts. Greene and Mackay both drove their adversaries into the sea, where they crashed and disappeared.No. 202 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 2nd. During a W/T reconnaissance by two D.H. 4 aeroplanes, two formations of five Albatross scouts were encountered. Capt. Vaughan and Lieut. McClure attacked one of these machines, and the observer (Lieut. McClure) shot it down out of control. Both of our machines were shot about but returned safely.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 2nd. Four 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to a trawler off Ostende.Camels dropped one 16-lb. bomb near T.B.D.S and three 16-lb. bombs on Mole, but the effect was not observed.Four 230-lb. bombs were dropped on three hostile destroyers 10 miles N.E. of Zeebrugge. The bombs fell very close, but the actual effect could not be observed.April 7th,-D.H. 4 aeroplanes on patrol at 1125 dropped four 230-lb. bombs from 1000 feet on three enemy destroyers, three miles N.E. of Ostende, which fell near the target, Heavy machine-gun fire was put up by the ships, which was replied to by our machines.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 11th. Seven Sopwith Camels each dropped one 50-lb. bomb on Zeebrugge Mole. Three bombs fell near two large ships alongside, two close to a large railway seaplane shed, one near base of Mole, and one direct hit on harbour offices.One machine, unable to reach objective, dropped its bomb near hangar of Bassin de Chasse, Ostende.
&apos; 5 . 144No. 202 Squadron,&apos;61 st Wing.April 12th. During a reconnaissance two machines were attacked off Ostende by 10 enemy scouts. About 800 rounds were fired, one E.A. being driven down, but result could not be observed owing to engagements with other E.A. The enemy used explosive bullets.No. 217 Squadron) 61st Wing.April 12th. Fourteen 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge Mole, Two direct hits were observed close to seaplane shed, one direct hit E. side of Mole on electric power-station, and one alongside building at end of Mole. Columns of smoke were seen to rise from these targets. Pilots of No. 202 Squadron confirm these hits.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 17th. A raid by 10 machines attempted on Utykerke Aerodrome was abandoned owing to fog.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 19th.

An aeroplane of this squadron whilst ort patrol near Furnes engaged an E.A. at 15,000 feet, which was last seen in a spin.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 20th. During a patrol of machines of this squadron four 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to an enemy trawler off Zeebrugge. Four 230-lb. bombs were also dropped on enemy billets S.E. of Nieuport and on roads behind enemy lines. Direct hits were observed.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 21st. During a patrol by machines of this squadron four 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to an enemy trawler N. of Zeebrugge, two of which burst about two feet away on port side amidships, causing vessel to roll violently.Two 230-lb. bombs were also dropped at 1205 on main road near Westende. A direct hit was observed.No. 204 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 21st. Lieut. Hickey attacked and brought down an enemy two-seater machine this side of the lines between Furnes and Wulpen. Both occupants of the enemy machine were made prisoners. Lieut. Hickey landed with machine undamaged, but was burnt about face and hands by explosion of the enemy machine.Lieut. Hill attacked a hostile kite balloon over Leffinghe, and forced it to be hauled down.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 21st.

Sixteen 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to Westende batteries and enemy shipping.  Results unknown.
No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 23rd. Several E.A. were sighted over Zeebrugge and Ostende, and a number of indecisive engagements took place.Lieut. Shaw and G/L Talboys were attacked by five Albatross scouts off Ostende, one of which was shot down and probably destroyed. Other piiots report having seen the E.A. going down.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 23rd. An enemy scout was attacked by a machine from this squadron and driven down in a steep glide, probably damaged.No. 204 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 25th. During a patrol by machines of this squadron 200 rounds were fired into enemy trenches behind Nieuport.No. 213 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 27th.-A raid by machines of this squadron was attempted on Zeebrugge, but owing to bad visibility the machines proceeded overland, and bombs were dropped on the following targets : Three 112-lb. bombs on Aircraft Stores Depot, Lisseweghe. One building destroyed and others damaged.One 112-lb. bomb on hangar at Hauttave, which was probably damaged.Two 112-lb. bombs on sheds at Uytkerke Aerodrome.

Results unknown.300 rounds were fired into huts at Lisseweghe.No. 217 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 27th.-Six 230-lb. bombs were dropped from 200-500 ft. on A.A. battery near Westende. All bombs burst on or close to target. One hundred rounds were also fired.During a raid on Uytkerke Aerodrome, one of our machines was attacked by four E.A., one of which was driven down in a vertical nose-dive and probably destroyed.No. 217, Squadron, 61st Wing.April 30th. A bomb raid by machines of this squadron was carried out on the electric power house at Ostende. Eleven 230-lb. bombs were dropped on this target, but owing to heavy detached clouds no results could be observed.SPECIAL OPERATIONS.During the night of the 22nd-23rd April, No. 5 Group co-operated with the Navy in important blocking operations against Zeebrugge and Ostende. Endeavours were made to obtain reliable information as to results early on the morning of the 23rd April.A W/T reconnaissance of No. 202 Squadron reported, from 50 ft. altitude, a clean break in the Mole about 15-20 yards where the Mole widens out on the landward side. A large party of men was working there. Later patrols confirmed the damage to, and debris in the water alongside, the Mole.Special bombing raids were carried out on the 23rd April by Nos. 213 and 217 Squadrons. , Eight 112-lb., four 20-lb., and ten 230-lb. bombs were dropped on and near Zeebrugge Mole, and direct hits were observed.Two 230-lb. bombs were also dropped on the Main road between Lombartzyde and Ostende, causing a large hole in the road.Between 1700 and 1719 No. 213 Squadron dropped seven 112-lb. bombs on and near Zeebrugge Mole, and two direct hits were observed. A working party on the Mole was fired on from 200-4000 ft.
No. 217 Squadron carried out special bombing raids, and eight 230-lb. bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge Mole between 0705 and 0915, three direct hits being claimed. At 1855 a further eight 230-lb. bombs were dropped on the same objective, and two 230-lb. bombs on Atelier de la Marine, Ostende. Owing to bad visibility no results were observed.Three hundred rounds were fired at A.A. Batteries at Westende.The success of these operations has produced a concentration of shipping at Bruges, ,which has greatly increased the bombing and reconnaissance work required, and of which every advantage is being taken.SPOTTING.No. 202 Squadron, 61st Wing.April 7th.-Machines of this squadron attempted to spot for R.M.A. siege guns, but were unsuccessful owing to smoke screens put up by the enemy.Spotting for two further shoots was carried out, but much difficulty was experienced through high power W/T jambing by the enemy. One shoot was partially and one quite successful.April 20th. W/T spotting for registration shoot on Mariakerke was carried out. Considerable difficulty was experienced in sending and receiving signals owing to W/T jambing by the enemy.BOMBING RAIDS CARRIED OUT ON NAVAL OBJECTIVES BY OTHER UNITS.April 1st. Nos. 207 and 217 Squadrons carried out a raid on Bruges Docks and Thourout Railway Junction, between 0330 and 0430. Over seven tons of bombs were dropped, many being seen to burst in the Bassins at Bruges.One large fire was started South of Darse No. 1.April 12th. Nos. 214 and 215 Squadrons carried out raids as follows : Batteries at Ostende   .....      ..      ..        14    112-lb. Bombs.Zeebrugge Mole and Batteries, East of      .. 250-lbCoastal Batteries between Ostende Blankenberghe 14    112-lb.    ,, The weather was not good when the machines started, and later became worse ; very low clouds, rain storms and thick ground mists being encountered.April 19th. One machine of No. 49 Squadron, unable to locate Thourout Railway Junction, dropped two 112-lb. bombs on Bruges Docks at 1600.April 23rd-At 0810 No. 49 Squadron dropped twelve 112-lb. bombs on Ostende Harbour, and at 1630 fifteen 112-lb. bombs on Quay of Bassin de Commerce on a large red building, which burst into flames, railway junction and line. Altogether 14 bursts were seen, three direct hits, and two fires started.At 0645 No. 211 Squadron dropped ten 25-lb. bombs on Ostende Harbour. Two bursts were seen in the Entrance Channel.At 1830 No. 211 Squadron dropped sixty-five 25-lb. bombs.  Firty-three bursts were seen and some direct hits on quays and houses in the vicinity. Two 112-lb. bombs were also dropped by No. 49 Squadron on Westende. No. 214 Squadron dropped three 550-lb. bombs on Zeebrugge.   One burst was observed on Darse No. 1, one direct hit on Solway works, and one close to Mole alongside Seaplane Base,
DOVER (AIRSHIPS, SEAPLANES AND AEROPLANES).The usual patrols were carried out by Airships and Seaplanes during the month of April. Special vigilance was kept on April 12th and 13th, and although the weather-was very bad a large number of patrols were carried out, and a total of 50 hours flying put in by Airships on one day.Fifty-two machines were received at the aerodrome during the month, and 48 despatched overseas.Seven machines were received from overseas and transferred to No. 218 Squadron forming at the Aerodrome.Summary of bombs dropped by R.A.F. units attached to 5th Group, R.A.F, from April 1st to 30th, 1918, inclusive :-Target.Hostile ShippingZeebrugge and Mole..OstendeLisseweghe Stores Depot  ..

ANTI-SUBMARINE OPERATION?. General Remarks.Statistics for the month of April are based on figures for the four weeks ending April 27th, 1918.During this period aircraft (excluding Kite Balloons) engaged on anti-submarine work in Home Waters have carried out 2301 patrols covering a distance of 327,059 miles. Of this distance 215,832 miles have been flown by Seaplanes and Aeroplanes, and 111,227 miles by Airships. The total time in air for &quot;Seaplanes, Aeroplanes and Airships is approximately 7,788 hours.Particulars of the work carried out in the Mediterranean will be issued under separate cover.Submarines have been sighted and attacked on the following occasions : SubmarinesDate.

Ashington      (      ,,      ). Slindon    (Mooring out Station) (Airships). Upton     (    ,, ,,)(,,).NEW DEVICE USED BY ENEMY SUBMARINES FOR AVOIDING ATTACK.(C. B. 01435.)It is stated that the enemy have invented a new device for submarines, which consists of a kind of torpedo without an explosive charge. This apparatus is fired from the torpedo tubes and proceeds at about the same rate as the submarine, leaving traces of oil. The object is to mislead hostile vessels into dropping depth charges on its trail, while the submarine escapes in another Idirection.MOONLIGHT PATROLS.Fishguard. Four moonlight patrols were carried out during the month by :he Commanding Officer and Senior Flying Officer with encouraging results, ;hips and other objects on the water being fairly easily discernible, and with the lelp of an Aldis Lamp, unmistakeable. In addition several test flights were nade by moonlight, and two extra Pilots trained for this purpose. Wing ip flares have been demanded for future use, and if approved it is hoped to arry out a considerable number of moonlight patrols in the future.LONG PATROL BY N.S. TYPE AIRSHIP.A patrol of 55 hours&apos; duration was carried out by Airship N.S.3 (Capt. . S. Wheelwright) from April 20th-22nd, 1918. The Airship carried a crew f 11, together with petrol, oil and water ballast, totalling 910 gallons; bombs, amera and plates, food, bedding and drinking water, totalling 975 lbs&apos;;.. 3 Lewis
guns, and 18 trays of ammunition. The average speed was 28 knots and the maximum speed 551 knots. Average distance covered (excluding zigzagging over convoys) 790 miles. The consumption of petrol, oil, etc., during the patrol was as follows : Total Petrol consumed      ..      ..   650 gallons.Average ,, Total oil Average oil Water ballast12 ,,    per hour.28 ,,5 ,,    per hour.20 ,,Gas consumed..      ..      ..        92,300 cubic ft.No defects became apparent during the patrol except that on subsequent inspection the rigging, controls, etc., were found to be chafed or worn.The engines ran excellently throughout, and were in perfect condition at the conclusion of the flight.No undue fatigue was experienced by the crew, and cooking was satis-factorily carried out.During the patrol, 35 hours 20 minutes were occupied on escort work. The trip constitutes a record for British aircraft.kite balloon experiments.On April 12th, Observers were sent up in a Kite Balloon in order to test the theory that tracks of vessels might be followed from the Phosphorescence of their &quot; wakes.&quot; This was found to be practicable and worthy of further attention and experiment, especially as it is known that submarines run on the surface during the dark hours.utility of kite balloons for preventing attacks onconvoys.A Kite Balloon (A.M.K. 11-10) in tow of H.M.S. &quot; P.C. 55 &quot; proceeded to .meet and escort a convoy on April 15th. Owing to a high wind and heavy seas Observers were able to be in the basket for only 4  hours out of 32. It is interesting to note, however, that a ship was sunk by torpedo at a point exactly on the track of the convoy which had passed 8 hours previously. It is probable the original objective of the submarine was the convoy and that it withheld its attack owing to the presence of the balloon.seaplanes and aeroplanes.Statistics of the work carried out by seaplanes and aeroplanes are given in Table A, page 13.Total number of patrols      ..      .,      ..      1,702Total distance flown......      ..   215,832 miles.Total number of hours flying over sea      ..      3,498Submarines sighted.......      .. 10Submarines attacked........ 8Total number of escorts      ..      ..      ..        176The details of attacks carried out are as follows :-dunkirk (no. 217 sq. 61 wing), april 3rd. An attack was carried out on an enemy submarine by D.H.4 aeroplanes No. A. 7867 (Pilot, Capt. Gonyon; Observer, Lieut. Reid) and A. 7846 (Pilot, Lieut Brown; Observer, A. C. Harper G/L) eight miles North East of Dunkirk. Two 230-lb. bombs were dropped from one machine at 1610 from heights of 700 and 400 feet respectively. The first bomb burst directly over the partially submerged submarine, and the second about 10 feet ahead of the first; after which a quantity of oil and air bubbles came to the surface.At 1611 the second machine dropped two 230-lb. bombs from 600 and 400 feet respectively, and both bombs fell in close proximity to those of the first machine.
iL tAt 1615 a third D.H. 4 machine (Pilot, Capt. Barnato) dropped two 230-lb. bombs from 1000 feet in the vicinity in which the bombs of the first two machines had been dropped.      ,In the meantime Capt. Gonyon, having obtained more bombs from the Jacrodromc, returned to the scene of the attack and dropped two 230-lb. bombs, [from 300 feet, into the middle of the patch on the water where the submarine fwas last seen. This machine with two others in company reported a white &quot;spar floating on the surface, and two large patches of oil, after the attack.Seaton Carew, April 6th.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2110 (Pilot, F. S. Lt. Addis) left at 1240 in search of an enemy submarine,-reported off Seaham, distance 75 sea miles, and at 1315 the periscope of a submarine was sighted five miles East of Sunderland. One 65-lb. bomb was dropped from 800 feet, and oil instantly appeared on the surface. Destroyer 96, which was in the vicinity came up and dropped three depth charges, after which more oil Nothing more was seen of the submarine.  Seaplane returned tocame up.  x^w....^ ... Base owing to thick mist and rain.Cattewater, April 10th.-Short Seaplane 1796 (Pilot Lt. J. L. Stocks, Observer Lt. E. R. Owen) left on patrol to search an area 10 miles east of Eddy-stone Lighthouse at 1400 (B.S.T.) and at 1535 when in position 50o N., 4&apos; W, sighted an enemy submarine of large type with mast in front of conning tower, stationary upon the surface about 10 degrees on the starboard bow and pointing North West. The seaplane immediately headed towards the submarine, which appeared unaware of its approach, until within f of a mile when the submarine [immediately commenced to submerge.  About 30 seconds after the submarine I was sighted two 100-lb. bombs were dropped, the first falling a few feet to the right and about 100 feet in front of the swirl, and the second, which failed to detonate, a few feet on the left and slightly further ahead.The explosion created an unusually large disturbance and the water surface was covered with a bright red substance extending outside the brownish residue ,. of the bomb explosion. Two calcium flares were dropped on the position. I After the attack the seaplane circled round the position twice, and it was I observed that the wake of the propeller had ceased. While returning to Base, a jj destroyer was sighted at 1545 and informed of the attack by signal lamp, which I was acknowledged, and the Destroyer proceeded to the position at high speed. I A W/T signal was sent to Base and all ships.Houton Bay, April 20th. Short Seaplane 1645 (Pilot Capt. Pipon, Observer 2nd Lieut. White) left on patrol, and at 1546 sighted a submarine on the surface steering West, in position 590 33&apos; N., 20 10&apos; W. The submarine dived before the seaplane could get into position to attack. The seaplane continued \ on patrol and at 1737 the periscope of the submarine was again sighted 590 33&apos; N., 20 42&apos; W.   The submarine dived before the seaplane could get : directly over it, and bombs were dropped on the swirl.  The seaplane searched I the vicinity until 1820, but nothing further was observed.Cattewater, April 22rid.-Whilst on patrol Short Seaplane N. 2832 (Pilot 1 Lt. Graham, Observer Lt. Allen) sighted an enemy submarine at 1544 on the j surface steering N.W. in position approximately 50o 03&apos; N., 30 15&apos; W. The sub-p marine, which had two masts ahead of the conning tower and a smaller one astern, I altered course two points to starboard then back again to N.W. The seaplane got into position and dropped one 230-lb. bomb which fell 50 feet on the star-board bow, and exploded about 10 seconds after the submarine had totally submerged.   One 100-lb. bomb was dropped which fell 50 feet directly ahead of the spot where the submarine disappeared.  The area was searched for two hours but nothing further was observed.Dunkirk (217 Sq. 61st Wing) April 23rd. DTI. 4 Aeroplanes Nos. A. 7773 and A. 8059 whilst on patrol sighted an enemy submarine within a radius of five miles, from a point 12 miles North of Zeebrugge. The aeroplanes proceeded
to attack and dropped four 230 lb. bombs, two of which burst directly on the submarine. Oil was observed on the surface before and after the attack ; no further details are given.Portland, April .25th.-Seaplane 9856 (Pilot Lt. F. D. Silwood, Observer Lt. Sawyer) left at 1240 to cover the Western patrol along the traffic route and at 1339 when in position 39 Y the feather of a periscope proceeding in a South Westerly direction was sighted about a quarter of a mile away on the port 4 bow. The seaplane turned immediately and proceeded to attack, dropping &quot; two 100-lb. bombs (2\ sees, delay), the first falling a few feet ahead of the disturbance, caused presumably by the conning tower, the submarine by this time having entirely submerged. The second bomb fell about 50-60 feet ahead of the wash but no results were observed. The seaplane turned again, and two more 100-lb. bombs (2  sees, delay) were dropped, which fell about 200 yards ahead of the first two. Two motor launches in the vicinity were then informed ; they immediately proceeded to the spot, and dropped five depth charges but without any apparent result. The seaplane circled round the position for some time ; then returned to Base.Seaton Carew, April 26th.-Aeroplane F.E.2 B. 5542 (Pilot Lt. MacDonald, Observer Lt. McMillan) sighted and bombed the periscope of a submarine at 1214 immediately after she had sunk a vessel in the War Channel one mile South of Seaham. A quantity of oil was observed on the surface where the bomb fell, but nothing further was seen.AIRSHIPS.Statistics of the work carried out by Airships are given in Table B, page 14.

(Pilot Capt. N. Grabowsky) left on patrol and at 1059 B.S.T. in position 50o 45&apos; N., I0 06&apos; E. the conning tower of a submarine was sighted about two miles distant steering West at an estimated speed of eleven knots. The Airship immediately opened out to full speed and proceeded to attack. The submarine dived on the approach of the airship and, two minutes afterward, two bombs were dropped about 200 to 300 yards ahead of where the wake ceased. Three minutes after the bombs had been dropped oil appeared on the surface and gradually increased, close to where the first bomb had exploded. The airship then sent a W/T to Base and returned for more bombs, and upon returning to the scene of the attack observed that the oil patch had increased considerably in size. A third bomb was dropped on the spot but no further results were observed, and after patrolling in the vicinity for several hours, the airship was recalled to Base.On April 10th and 11th, the Airship proceeded to the position of the oil patch, which was estimated to be eight to nine miles from Dungeness, and observed that oil was still rising. On April 12th, oil was still observed to be rising, the oil patch then being about one mile in length, and the following day a photograph of the oil patch was taken.KITE BALLOONS.Statistics of the work carried out by Kite Balloons are given in Table C, page 14.Total number of patrols     ...... 17Total distance covered      ...... 7829 miles.Total number of hours in air       ..      .. 767Submarines sighted......      ..
