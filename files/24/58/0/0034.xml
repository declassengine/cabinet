I am convinced that a very bitter feeling will be aroused if the representations of the Bishops are disregarded.I am sorry to add to your cares, I know how many and pressing they must be.Believe me,Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.) P. CARD. BOURNE, To the Right Honourable Abp. of Westminster.David Lloyd George.MEMORANDUM.The Catholic Bishops of England and Wales have watched with sympathetic interest, but with some anxiety, the efforts of the Government to give an extended organisation to the national system of education; and have, moreover, looked confidently to the MiniBtaj of Education to carry out his pledge, repeated in many places throughout the country, not to depart from the settlement of 1902.Now that the Bill has passed through the Committee stage it seems neoessary to the Bishops to call attention to the following points,1.   Hitherto, whenever education has been made compulsory, a statutory place has been given to non-provided sohoole affording education of the type which children are oompelleA by law to reoeivi Under certain definite conditions euoh non-provided schools have a statutory right to receive recognition and maintenance from the Educational Authorities.   This is a right enshrined in the Act of 1902,2,   The Government has now determined to extend the area of compulsion to the education to be given in the new continuation schools.
3.   It seems,, therefore, a matter of elementary Justice that non-provided continuation schools should receive a statutory place with -guarantees for due recognition and maintenance at the hands of the Educational Authorities equivalent ta those already belonging to non-provided  elementary schools.!Che 3ishops consider that it would be a grate breach of the party truce, imposed and accepted as a consequence of tha war, were the Government to males use of an expiring Parliament to pass the present Bill without embodying la it those statutory safeguards for non-provided continuation schools which are still lacking. It should be remembers c) that several prominent Catholics, who have gladly given their services to the Government solely on account of the war, are, neverfcholjs^, thereby debarred from that effective criticism of the Bill which they would loudly utter in other circumstances: that thousands of men are absent in the fighting line whose voices would otherwise he heard in defence of tho dual system of education; and that the women voters have so far had no means of making their influence felt in a question which closely regards them.The Bishops, in a spirit of loyal consideration for the War Cabinet, and with a sincere desire for the educational progress of the nation, have so far discountenanced any public agitation against the Bill notwithstanding the inadequacy of the considers-tion shown until new for the jast claims of the upholders of the non-provided system-   While reserving their full right to take public action, tho Bishops prefer to make this private appeal to the War Cabinet and to the President of the Board of Education in the confident hope that more public action will not be needed.They base their appeal on grounds both of religious freedom and educational efficiency, for there can be no complete educational progress in the nation if any of the competent educational forces of the country are to be set aside or in any way dfcB^auragad on grounds which are purely political and in no sense educational.Archbishop4a House, Westminster, S.W.
