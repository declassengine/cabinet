WAR    0 A B I 31 E T.\[/ T,HpB FUTURES- of HOMS HUUB.Mr, G.I-I.BAMES.I venture to address my colleagues on the question of Homo Rulo for Ireland, being induced to do oo by the reading of the memoranda transmitted through the Ambassadors Office at Washington, dated 27th, June, No, 559,(120681),The &quot;firm and fearless&quot; administration of the country is, so far as we know, already creating a better atmosphere, and the time is, I think, coming, if it has not already ar-rived, when another attempt might be made to improve it still more by settling the question of Home Rule,      I was not at the time of our recent controversy, inclined to agree to the Bill, which gave double safeguards to ulstar, but having re-gard to Mr, Asquith&apos;s pledges in 1914, and to the strong and justifiable feeling in Ulster against anything being forced upon them during the war, I should be inclined now to agree to that Bill being introduced, and both sections being pres-sed for assent.     Or alternatively, if the exclusion of cer-tain counties in the North 3ast were a better basis for ac-oommodation, I should be quite willing to agree to that, providing that it was a settlement by a time l2,mit basis, and would be, if not agreed to, at all events, not too vio-lently opposed by either of the sections in Ireland.I think events proved that we made a mistake in trying conscription,   I donrt attempt to justify t&amp;e subsequent of the anti-conscriptionists and thethreat whifa, they made.    But I think that, from the prac-tical point of view, it was a mistake to have called forth such a storm as met the conscription proposal.    It is not easy to admit mistakes but when, as in this case, it is so clear, I have no hesitation in doing so.
-2*Tho trying of conscription led to a condition of mind not favorable to any -ac comaeaction, and has, I m afraid, in its results, led also to a stiffening of the position in Ulster,     The&apos; granting of Hcnia Rule now,, however, would prepare the way for the adoption of conscription, if or when voluntary recruiting i*s proved to fail.   If wo do nothing, and let tho period of voluntary recruiting ex-piro without the measure of success which we have siipu-latod for, it will be just as difficult, (and I think impossible) to apply conscription then as it was three months ago, and we shall be faced with a very difficult situation,   If we take some initial steps now, our action would come&apos;as an act of grace, ^/heroas later on, if forced by circumstances to take them, they would not produce the same good rasult.   The Prime Minister&apos;s letter of last year has had wide publicity, and failure on our part to give effect to it will, I feel suro, produce a very bad effeot abroad,I had hoped some time ago that Federalism would ripen qickly in this country, and enable us to extricate our-selves from a difficult position, but it is quite evident that federalism is a lonr^ way off, and is not likely to mature in time to count.   The leaders of both sections in Ireland might;-be approached and induced to come together with a view of some agreement on the basis of the Bill which was prepared, with such modifications as might be agreed upon if necessary* and a Bill intwducsd before the &apos;Recess,   Or alternatively, the other proposal should be discussed with the some Objsct in view.    The Cabinet migli remit the matter to a Kinister to produce a Bill and to report before presenting it to Parliament,.  G.U,B,2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., July 23rd, 1918.
