 e^tioaD.Ixitelliganoe JDe^jartmont,Qonfi dential. July&quot; 15, 1918.Norway /003.FOREIGN OI^ICE.MEMORANDUMj7J/      (/onSITUATION IN NORWAY.Ooigmunloated by an Englishman resident in Norway.The political situation generally is too confused for me to attempt to give a olear statement concerning it, or to prophesy as to the result of the coming October election:   I can only play with the question.    It Is generally believed, however, that the present Government will stand.    The Socialists will probably improve their position - at the last election they polled 198,100 votes, or 22 per cent of the whole - but as there is not proportional representation they will not get a majority of members.    Many middles-class people are considering seriously whether to vote Socialist as a protest against the Government.    Fareical as have been many of the Govern-menfs efforts to deal with domestic war problems, efforts have at any rate been made;   and these are believed to be mostly due te Socialist pressure.    On the other hand, the present Government has one powerful card:   it has &quot;kept Norway out of the War&quot;, so that many Liberals who are very dissatisfied with its domestic policy will continue to support it.    Fof this is the great demand of the masses of the Norwegian people:    eaoe.    Under no circumstances dothey desire war;   and they have felt themselves so often under the shadow of war that they cannot but feel grateful to the &quot;statesmen&quot; who, they imagine, have always warded off the threatening oatas-trophe.    But all parties are in a state of transition - or rather solution.    The Socialists are not yet quite shaken down to a steadylevel after their recent fight on policy, the liberals are busy try-ing to keep together on such questions of &quot;landsmaal&quot; and temperance;/all
all parties are feeling that new polities are needed.    But no party expects to develop a clear polioy for this election.    The times-are out of joint;   and everyone feels that, $ust as they have gone on from day to day for nearly tour years concerned only to keep at peace with both sides, so must they oon-fcinue until the end of the War and then settle down to domestic party politics again.So far as foreign polities is concerned, there is the same leaden apathy.    One might reasonably have hoped that Norwegians would have felt towards the Westeam Powers if not gratitude at any rate enough satisfaction in the signing of the American agreement to have called forth some expression of appreciation.    Both grati-tude and appreciation are lacking.    The fact is that Norway as a whole, whilst strongly pro-BritiBh, is not inclined to thank either side for anything.    It will take all it can get, and ask for more. There has been so much written on the subject of Norwegian shipping services to the Allies that the ordinary Norwegian has a tremendous-ly exaggerated idea as to what the Allies owe to Norway.    He will aever b8 grateful to the Allies because, according to his reckon-Ing, the Allies can never do enough for Norway.    England has just reduced the price of coal by Kr.10 per ton:   the only paper that writes at length on the matter to-day reports from the manager of one of the leading coal firms - the only firm interviewed - that the reduction is disappointing as ho had expected it to be Kr.25! I do not see how we: can expect anything else.    For nearly four years Norway has watched this struggle.    Without an effort it has made what would have seemed a few years ago fabulous wealth out of the War.    Acts which filled it with horror in the early days of tho War are now accepted as commonplaces.    Few people are moved now when a Norwegian ship is reported torpedoed and half of its crew blown to pieoes.    The chief question asked concerns insurance. And it seems to me that this is a natural development.    Peace at/any
any prioo must .inrol^re owpdmcvriaQ -in acts- of violence;   it must leaa to apathy and the gradual sloughing of all those aualitiee that make for sensitiveness where national honour, dignity, and moral are concerned.    Materially Norway has profited Immfthsely from the War;   morally it has lost what this generation oan never retrieve.Note fry the F.I.D.Here we find mentioned the same &quot;apathy&quot; as exists in Sweden and the same desire for peace at any price.The writer is very severe - unduly so it would seem - on the Norwegians.    That they have not shown over much gratitude at the ^signing of the agreement is true and not unnatural.    They have paid for it directly by drastically restricting their exports to Germany and indireotly by further irritating Germany who, they be--lieye, will take revenge if and when occasion arises.    Also the bulk of the nation has suffered great hardships principally owing to our blockade - the &quot;fabulous&quot; \?ealth is confined to a limited elass only.With regard to moral loss, feelings everywhere are blunted. There is no roason to believe that Norway has lost its moral sense to an exceptional degree - certainly not more than any other neutral nation in similar circumstances.
