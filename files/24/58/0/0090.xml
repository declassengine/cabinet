121/France/1022.REPORT ON LABOUR ORGANISATION IN FRANCE.Reference:&quot;To Proceed to France to Undertake an Enquiry into the whole Question of LabourOrganisation and Report,&quot;In the course of the enquiry it was found necessary to take a comprehensive view of what constitutes Labour and of all matters that either directly or indirectly affect it.(1.) INTRODUCTION.In accordance with instructions received, I left for France on Sunday, the 27th January, accompanied by: Mr. David Gilmour, C.B.E., M.I.C.E. Mr. Percy T. Gask, M.I.C;E. Mr. Arthur H. Kingsley, A.M.I.C.E. Captain Arrol Moir, R.E.Messrs. G. TV. Scrivinge and G. F. Marshall,The same day I was fortunate enough to see Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, to whom I explained my mission. He briefly told me the present position as regards Labour, and kindly promised me every assistance.The following morning I had an interview with Lieutenant-General Travers Clarke, Quartermaster-General, and went somewhat fully into the Labour problem with him. Afterwards I proceeded, accompanied by Brigadier-General E. Gibb, Director of Labour, to his headquarters at Hesdin.Before I could fix any programme it was necessary for me to obtain general particulars of the history of Labour in France, the system and conditions under which it was being worked, and the distribution of it, &amp;c. General Gibb kindly placed the whole of his information and statistics at our disposal, and explained in detail the system to which he was working.I was then in a position to lay out an itinerary of the places to be visited, and a programme of the points to be carefully studied, such as would he fairly typical of the whole. During the tour very few departures from the decision then come to were made, and the insight obtained proved to be most comprehensive. General Gibb was, fortunately, able to accompany us during most of the tour,. and was of the greatest assistance. The journeys aggregated some 1,970 kilometres, during which a great number of Labour centres were inspected. These comprised, amongst others, the ports at Rouen, Dunkerque, and Calais, Ammunition, Ordnance, Supplies and R.E. Dumps, Main Defence Works in Corps Areas, Forests, Salvage Collecting and Restoration Centres, Quarries, R.F.C. Maintenance Shops, Tank Repair Depot. Mechanical Transport Repair Shops, Locomotive and Wagon Erection Shops, Laundries, Petrol Depots, and the Headquarters of the Chinese Labour Corps. (For details, see Appendices Nos. 1 and 2.)The different classes of Labour actually&apos; seen at work included skilled and unskilled White Labour Companies, Prisoners of War, Chinese, Aliens, Cape Coloured and South African Native Labour, Indians, Nagas, French and Belgian civilians, Non,-Oombatant Companies, and British military prisoners. Almost every class of Labour was seen at least once, many of them frequently, and all under widely different conditions and on varied, kinds of work.   (See Appendix No. 3:)During the course of my visit to France, I had the opportunity of discussing the Labour, problem with a considerable number of officers, including not only those who are actually handling the Labour or for whom the Labour is employed, but also the senior officers in charge of the different Directorates and those in command of theT Secretaries.
different areas and centres visited. I think without exception they discussed the Labour position very frankly, and the information they gave has been of the greatest assistance.  -It will be gathered from this brief outline of my movements that the conclusions I - have come to are based on facts observed at many representative centres, from personal interviews with officers and &quot;employers&quot; using the Labour and officers actually allocating the Labour, from statistics and explanatory statements supplied by thei heads of Departments, and a careful study and fairly full realisation, even in the short time at my disposal, of the intricacies of inter-departmental relationships, and the many points that have a bearing on the Labour problem.(2.) LABOUR DIRECTORATE.Brief History. I do not think it necessary to more than touch upon the past his-tory as regards Labour. Originally the work that is carried out by the Labour Direc-torate was carried out by the different Services, but it was found some other system would have to be introduced owing to the ever-growing demands for Labour, to the enormous increases in the numbers employed, and the necessity for employing foreign Labour. The Labour Directorate, under Brigadier-General E. Gibb, was therefore formed approximately a year ago. The system which was inaugurated, as far as it went, was in many respects quite good, and their statistics and records were excei-lent, and great credit is due to General Gibb and his Staff for the work they have done, in spite of the difficulties they had to contend with.Duties. The real function of the Labour Directorate was not to employ Labour, but to act in the capacity of a Labour or Unemployment Exchange in other words, upon receiving the demands from the different Directorates acting on the Quarter-master-GeneraTs instructions, it allocated the Labour to them, having regard to the urgency of the work in question and to the supply of Labour available. (See Appendix No. 7.) Further, as the centre of gravity of the Labour demand fluctuates considerably, this Directorate frequently arranged for the drafting of Labour from one centre to another-. In addition, it had to see that Labour was not kept, longer than was absolutely necessary on any one task. It is sometimes extremely difficult to decide this point, but it is one of vast importance, in view of the constant growth of the Armies&apos; demands, both in urgency and quantity.The responsibility of keeping the Labour efficiently occupied really rested with the Directorates employing the Labour. It should be pointed out, however, that in some cases these latter arranged to sub-contract their work out to the Labour Direc-torate, leaving the actual carrying qut of the same to it. This system is quite a good one, and has many advantages, as it saves the risk of dual control, throws the responsibility on to Labour, and tends to make the offices in charge of Labour much keener and more alive as to the outputs. It also has advantages in the distribution of Labour, and is a system that should be introduced wherever possible.It is unfortunate that at the time this mission was undertaken, a revised scheme as regards Labour was in the process of being put into force. It would have been much better, if it had been possible, to have deferred making any changes until after the Report had been received.Labour Organisation. To get the best results out of any Labour organisation it is essential: (a.) That the selection of the personnel should be most carefully done, as every-thing depends upon the men in charge. It must be remembered that it sometimes happens that a man&apos;s record on paper as to what he has done is no criterion as to his suitability for a particular appointment.(&amp;.) That Labour should be fluid and available wherever required, and not defi-niteily allocated to any particular service. As. a consequence, I agree that the system of pool Labour is a most desirable one, and I go further and consider that all Labour in France, whether skilled, unskilled, or specialised, should be made as fluid as possible. On the other hand, of course, it is most desirable that as far as is practicable the men should be kept at the work to which they are accustomed, and not be changed over to other work indiscriminately. This, I think, could readily be clone without altering the pool system. No doubt*in the past considerable difficulty has arisen due to Labour that has been more or less trained for particular work having to be removed elsewhere, owing either to the
influx of a new type of Labour, to the question of climatic conditions, or, further, to the repatriation of certain types of Labour recruited early whose contracts are now expiring. ; - (c.) That the control should be clearly defined, and the responsibility for carrying out the work put on to the officers in charge of Labour. (d.) That a spirit of esprit de corps be infused into the different organisations which would tend to counteract slackness and the &quot;go-as-you-please&quot; methods so often obvious at the present. time. Also that every help be given to the younger officers who are keen, but who lack the encouragement and assistance without which they are apt to lose heart.Numbers Available. The total amount of Labour that is included in the Labour pool amounts to approximately a total of 306,000, but it cannot be pointed out too strongly that this amount of Labour is not available for actual work, owing to men required for camp duties, men on leave, sickness, and also for a proportion of men off for a day&apos;s rest in each week where continuous work is being carried on. The percentage, of course, varies, but it can be taken in round figures that it amounts to at least 27 per cent, to 28 per cent., or reduces the number available to apiproxi-mately 240,000. (See Appendix No. 4.) In addition, it should be pointed out that this number includes some 32,000 men in the area employment compainies. These men are not available for ordinary Work; the duties they undertake are necessary duties, but are more or less of a permanent character, such as; bandsmen, batmen, butchers, cooks, clerks, shoemakers, tailors, traffic controllers, and many other trades.The number of effectives in these companies amounts to 25,000, which should oome off the total available for work, namely, 240,000 in other words, the amount of pooled Labour that can be considered as available for work is consequently reduced to some 215,000.Labour- -General Considerations. Up to the present time Labour has been &quot; nobody&apos;s child.&quot; No one has felt responsible for it, and it has been a ready excuse for deficiencies wThich have occurred. It is essential that the responsibility for its effective and efficient use should be put on to certain individuals, who must be in a position to control the Labour. Under the arrangement that has recently been made there should be a distinct improvement in this respect, as the higher authorities will now have a direct interest in the Labour under them. The risk under the new scheme is, however, that, unless carefully guarded against, it may lose its &quot;fluidity&quot; and get into watertight compartments.In considering the control of Labour, one has to take into account the tempera-ment of Labour. &quot;&quot;Whilst this varies considerably in different nationalities, from my experience the Labour we have to deal with in France can be broadly classed in the same category, so far as temperamental considerations are concerned.No one is quicker than the average labourer, and I include the foreign labourer also, in noticing if there is a lack of organisation, a badly laid out depot run in an unsystematic way, an officer in charge who does not appreciate or know his job or what he can expect from his men. These points have a very great influence on him. He is extremely susceptible to his surroundings, and takes his stroke from the slowest this is especially so in the case of the Chinese. Too great care, therefore, cannot be taken to secure the right atmosphere. He appreciates consideration as regards his welfare, but does not appreciate being pandered to in fact, he resents it. He can be led, but there are few cases when he can be driven. What he requires and desires is for his officer to know his work, be firm, absolutely just, and to keep faith with him. It is then possible to get a good day&apos;s work out of him. I noticed in going round that where the best results are being obtained, the officers in charge had not only been accustomed to handle Labour, but had the above considerations always in view.(3.) POINTS AFFECTING LABOUR.I will now deal in some detail with the different points that I noticed which affect Labour. I have endeavoured to put the essential points as briefly as possible, and have grouped them for more convenient reference. Shortly, however, the result of my enquiry shows clearly that the main prejudicial factors as regards Labour and its efficiency are the want of supervision, the lack of co-ordination between the different Directorates, the need for standardisation, and the want of appreciation as.to relative values, by which I mean the non-realisation of the effect different matters have upon Labour as a whole. These four points are dealt with at some length on pp. 9 to 11. I will now deal with certain details that lead up to these main factors.[633] . c
Task Work. By task work is meant a fixed amount of work which the labourer or a squad of men have to do, and when it is done they have finished their day&apos;s work and are allowed to knock oil work and return to tneir camps. Piecework, on the other hand, is work which is let to the man at an agreed price and they get paid for the work they do in other words, payment by results. Unfortunately, I fear the army system is such as to make piecework impossible, otherwise I would most strongly have advocated it as being the best method to adopt.It is satisfactory to note that endeavours are being made to introduce task work, but it is regretted that it is by no means universal, and some officers we have met do not appear in favour of it, or realise what results can be obtained. It is obvious that the system should be extended as far as possible, as it can only lead to more efficient outputs.Unfortunately, owing to lack of experience amongst the employers and officers, there is an absence of uniformity as to what constitutes a fair day&apos;s work. The fixing of the task is often left to men who have never handled Labour before, with the result that frequently either far too light a task is fixed, or one far too heavy. Consequently, adjustments have to be made, and the labourer at once sees that there is no appreciation as to what is a fair day&apos;s work. The men, thereforCj set their own pace and mislead their officers by taking care not to finish their task too early. At present there appears to be no power to keep the men at work until the task is finished, and it is therefore very desirable that some penalty should be introduced in cases where deliberate attempts are made to refrain from completing a fair day&apos;s work. On the other hand, it is essential that the men should get the full benefit when they finish their task early.Extra Pay. As an incentive extra pay can, I understand, be given to prisoners of war and Chinese tradesmen, but full advantage does not appear to be taken of this. Great uncertainty exists amongst employers as to how far they can go in this direction. I quite agree with the principle, which should be extended considerably. It would be better if it could be made applicable not only to tradesmen in skilled companies, but to tradesmen who may be attached to unskilled companies. In fact, for really good work, I should like to go further and see some system introduced by which a general bonus could be given to single individuals, squads of men, or whole companies, including the men employed at the camps, such as cooks, &amp;c, as they are able to do a great deal to satisfy the men and thus influence their work. Careful discrimination would have to be used, but with proper care I am sure the result would be most beneficial and in the end be a great saving of time, money, and number of men required.The officers who are responsible for the outputs, where tradesmen are receiving extra pay, should be able to deduct this pay, either for a period or altogether, in the event of a man not doing efficient work or becoming slack.In the case of prisoners of war where extra pay is given, facilities for spending their earnings in the canteens should be provided, otherwise they have no induce-ment to earn it, for, as the amount is small, they would probably not think it worth while saving it.Skilled Work. We visited many shops and depots where skilled companies were at work. Many of these have been formed from prisoners of war and Chinese tradesmen, and they are generally doing excellently. The men naturally prefer this class of work as it is more interesting than ordinary labouring, and it also helps to keep their hands in for their ordinary occupations after the war. In some of the shops, however, I noticed that the skilled prisoners of war were not being used to the best advantage.A tendency to overcrowding was noticed, which is not conducive to the best results; also, in places, the different nationalities are too much mixed up.At some of the Ordnance Depots and different Repair Shops the repairing and restoration of salved parts is being undertaken with marked success, and every encouragement and help should be given co this work. Additional accommodation and tools would be of considerable help in extending their usefulness, and in some shops the output could be greatly increased by speeding up the machine tools already existing.It must be remembered that all work of this description helps with the shipping problem, besides having the further advantage of often being able to supply locally things which are urgently required.Loading and Shortage of Wagons. In some cases it struck me that sufficient care was not taken in loading wagons, either as regards stowage, or in seeing that they were carrying their maximum load.  The former affects the Labour and time
required for unloading, the latter is very important from a traffic point of view, and also from a Labour point of view, when the task is based on a certain number of wagons to unload. ...i found that a considerable amount of time was on occasions lost, owing to the shortage of wagons and the uncertainty of the time the trains would arrive, it sometimes happens that a train does not arrive on the day it is expected and for the unloading of which Labour has been requisitioned. Further, I saw cases where unexpected trains had arrived before those in &quot;the sidings had been discharged, and as it is a rule that wagons must not be held up for more than four hours, the con-fusion in the depot at the end of this rushed unloading was appalling, entailing a large amount of double handling and sorting.Shipment and Checking of Goods. I observed that, in certain instances, there was the risk of a considerable amount of confusion and also the necessity for extra Labour, owing to the cases that the goods arrived in from home not being clearly marked, and to different classes or weights of goods being contained in identical cases. . One instance was in connection with ammunition, i.e., Stokes&apos; shells con-signed to the three Allied fronts were all packed in similar cases, the only difference being in the stencilling, which was badly done, and, in some cases, almost undecipher-able; the labels were invariably missing. Another instance was that the same size biscuit cases from the same firm contained either 40 or 50 lbs. weight. As it is necessary that these should be kept in different stacks, it is extremely difficult for this to be done where foreign Labour is employed, who cannot read the markings, and it is made very much worse when night work is carried on. If different coloured bands or markings could be adopted, the foreign labourer would easily be able to notice the difference, and there would be an economy in Labour.There is further a loss of time due to mixed stowage in the cargoes from home, and also due to the weakness of the packages that have recently been sent out, and to the irregularities in the shipment of certain supplies such as hay, the latter necessitating additional handling and transportation from reserve stocks else-where. I certainly think closer touch should be kept between the people at home and the people in France as regards these points, as, whilst in themselves they may not appear of any great moment, they have, as a matter of fact, a considerable influence on the amount of Labour required, more particularly in the case of foreign Labour.Would it not be possible to send out bulky articles, such as stove pipes, in plates instead of rolled? It would save stowage, and they could easily be made up in the different shops.I was informed that, owing to the Regulations in force for audit and accoun-tancy purposes, an appreciable amount of Labour had to be employed over and above what should have been required for the mere handling of the goods. Whilst it is essential to have proper records kept, I would strongly recommend that the existing system be reviewed to see if it would not be possible to achieve the required end, and at the same time considerably reduce the amount of Labour that is at present required.Tonnage Handled and Stack-to-Stack Tonnage. It is very generally found that the different Directorates and officers have adopted the system of putting the unloading or loading into tons per man hour. Whilst this is excellent so far as it goes, it is in some cases very misleading, as it does not take into account all the Labour required. I mean that I came across cases where the figures shown to me only included unloading trucks alongside the siding, and did not take into account the Labour required to stack the goods.A very large proportion of Labour is used for this purpose, and the only real criterion is to take the total Labour employed divided into the total useful tons handled. I emphasise useful tons, as I came to the conclusion there was far too great a tendency to re-handle materials more than once, which could have been avoided in many cases by more foresight and better supervision. The stack-to-stack tonnage amounts to a huge quantity, and whilst there are necessarily cases where this cannot be avoided, it is of the greatest importance, from a LaJDOur point of view, that it should be cut down to a minimum.The Lay Out of Yards and Dumys-Thh has a very considerable bearing on the quantity of Labour required and its efficiency. Some depots we saw were exceedingly well laid out, whereas others were very inferior. Whilst it is obvious that, owmg to the uncertainties that must exist during war, it is often impossible to forecast5with any degree of certainty for how long a dump will be required, or what size it will become, yet I cannot but feel that in some cases sufficient attention
Ghas not been given to the points that so greatly affect Labour. Proper railway and road facilities and plenty of room to expand are essential for economic and rapid handling. The officer in charge should also have a clear programme as to what he is aiming at, and how he proposes to stack the materials, and the system on which the yard should be worked. This was woefully lacking in many cases. Several yards could with advantage be remodelled, and I think it would be possible to combine some of the yards dealing with the same classes of materials in the same areas. I found several cases where the officer in charge had only been at the depot for a very short time, and usually these.cases were found where an unsatisfactory state of things existed; provided an officer is suitable, changes should not be made more frequently than are really necessary. The personnel was far too small in some instances to run the depot efficiently, whilst in others the reverse seemed to be the case.The Use of Mechanical Appliances. There appears to be generally (except in connection with the docks) a want of appreciation of the benefit that would be derived from a more extensive use of labour-saving devices not only mechanical, but the ordinary devices that are generally adopted at the present time, such as raised platforms for unloading, hoppers for stowage, Decauville tracks, stone crushers, &amp;c. In some cases full advantage was not taken of appliances on the ground, whilst in others I was informed that requisitions for plant had been turned down. Those in authority and also the financial people should render every possible assistance when a good case is made out, as the first cost will be insignificant corn-pared with the saving both directly and indirectly that should be made. It is not only a case of saving a man&apos;s wages or the equivalent, but it means more Labour will be available elsewhere alternatively, more men might have to be sent out, necessitating additional camp&apos; accommodation, more supervision, extra equipment and supplies, &amp;c, all of which react back to the shipping.Sunday Work. Wherever possible Sunday work as regard,? Labour should not be undertaken. An endeavour is made to give every man one day&apos;s rest in seven, but this is nothing like as effective as resting the whole Company at one time, as it tends to disorganisation work, usually carried out by men accustomed, to it, having to be done by others. The white personnel, when continuous work is carried out, get very little opportunity for a rest, and there are consequently signs of staleness-which are reacting on efficiency.I understand in some camps there would be a shortage of baths if all the men are off&apos; on one day. The cost of the extra accommodation necessary would more than be repaid by better results in the work.Night Work. This is unsatisfactory, and should be avoided as far as possible, except in urgent cases.Camps. Generally speaking, the camps I saw were in every way suitable, and they show that the officers take an interest in the welfare of their men. This is all-important. On the other hand, I noticed one or two cases where perhaps more Labour had been spent in beautifying a camp than was necessary. If the men do the work in their &quot; off time &quot; nothing can be said against it in fact, it should be encouraged, but Labour that can be usefully employed elsewhere should not be used for this purpose.It is very desirable that ample accommodation should be provided for the men to dry their wet things. The heat from an incinerator could be used for this purpose. Men who can get round a good fire and have dry clothes are much more contented&quot; than they otherwise would be, and a contented man works much better than a man who has a grumble.(4.) DIFFEKENT CLASSES OF LABOUR.The following is a short summary of the various types of Labour met with in the course of my investigations, and in Appendix No. 5 is a graph showing their relative percentage to the whole: (a.) Royal Marine Labour. The &quot;Inboard &quot; Labour on the ships is being clone by the navy, but there are times when it is necessary to supplement this by men from the Pool. The conditions under which the Royal Marine Labour is serving are quite different to those existing on shore. tinder the existing arrange-ment dual control cannot be avoided. I am strongly of opinion that it is advisable that the whole of the Labour employed in connection with unloading of ships should come under the army.   It would save dual control, tend to economise Labour, and do
away with a possible chance of friction. The Docks Directorate should take over from the time the ship is moored alongside, and if they were told the time in which she had to be unloaded, they could make their arrangements, and would be respon-sible if they failed. At the present time the rate of unloading is practically always governed by the rate the goods are taken away from the quay by the Docks Directorate.If it is considered that it is impossible to make the change at one sweep, I would urge that at least a fairly extended trial should be made at one port which, if satisfactory, and I am sure it would be, should subsequently be extended to all(b.) Area Employment Companies.  which they are allotted, and are posted to these companies contain approximately 3 following classes: (1.) Arnly Headquarters Companies ... (2-) Corps(-;&apos;.) Divisional Employment Companies (4.) Army Area Employment Corps  ...(5.) Area Employment Artisan Corn-pan ies. In addition there are-Area Employment Garrison Guard Companies (armed).These companies remain in the area to an existing Labour group. At present 2,000 men, who are divided into theThe Labour Directorate appoint theofficers, but do not control the dutiesthey peform. The Labour Directorate are responsiblefor the proper employment of thesecompanies. Controlled and administered by thechief engineer of the army concerned.Allotted to formations to guard ammu-nition dumps, stores. &amp;c.The establishment of an Area Employment Company consists of 2 officers and 273 N.C.O.&apos;s and men.This class of labour, consisting as it does of bandsmen, batmen, butchers, cooks, clerks, shoemakers, tailors, traffic controllers, and many other trades, can hardly be considered as Labour pure and simple, but being included in the total Pool Labour a wrong impression is given of the numbers available for ordinary work.(cj British Labour Companies. These companies are unarmed, and cannot, therefore, be used in the extreme forward zones. Owing, however, to the restric-tions that exist as to the areas in which foreign Labour can be employed, they have to do the bulk of the forward work. Their officers speak very highly of thein and find them very willing to do all they possibly can, but it cannot be too strongly pointed out that they are all low-category men, and many of them of considerable age in fact, the average age of one company we heard of was 55 years. Being in the forward zone, they have to live under very trying conditions, being very often bombed both day and night. Consequently, the amount of work that can be expected from them is relatively small compared with normal conditions.Although classed as Labour companies, we found amongst them a large number of men who are quite unaccustomed to Labour work and., in fact, had not either the physique or any idea of doing hard manual work. The lack of skilled supervision in many instances added to the reason for the comparatively small amount of work done.There are 230 companies of this class of Labour. It would be as well to point out here that, generally speaking, the different companies controlled by the Labour Directorate have an establishment of 500 all ranks.(d.) Canadian labour Battalions. These men may only be employed in the area of the Canadian Corps, and move with that corps. There are two battalions, both attached to the First Army. Many of these men might with advantage be drawn upon to take positions of supervisors in the forests, on the roads, and other classes of Labour where supervision is so short, as even if they have not been &quot;gangers,&quot; many of them have had experience of every kind of work in Canada. The skilled Canadians, of course, are exceptionally good, and are employed on every branch of railway work, on saw -benches, bridge .work, and many other skilled trades.(e.) Aliens (Middlesex Labour Companies). These companies may not be employed in small detachments, on ammunition depots, or at base ports, nor near prisoners of war. There are four companies of this class of Labour, all attached to the Fourth Army.
(f.) South African Native Labour Companies.-The Kaffirs are divided into two main classes, containing many tribes. Their contracts do not permit of their being used in the danger zone, and the twenty companies are, therefore, all employed on the lines of communication. They appear to have given complete satisfaction from every point of view, both in quality, ability, health, and behaviour j but, in my opinion, their efficiency could have been improved by better supervision, and by their being worked more on the lines that prevail in South Africa. They are being repatriated as their contracts fall in, and will all have left by the autumn.    (See Appendix No. 6.)(g.) Cape Coloured Boys. There is one battalion of these boys employed on the lines of communication, chiefly as drivers and horsemen, for which they are specially suitable.   Their contract is for the period of the war.(h.) Indian Labour Companies. These comprise no less than fifteen tribal units, and may not be employed in the danger zone. The Nagas especially have proved satisfactory, as they are strong and willing; the Chins have also clone very well, but in both cases it is necessary to work them in large gangs under their own N.C.O.&apos;s. There is a lack of European supervision, which is very short, especially for semi-skilled work, and there is also the difficulty of the languages, as some of the tribes speak dialects for which it is almost impossible to obtain interpreters.There are fifty-five companies of Indian Labour employed, all of whom are on a twelve months&apos; contract, including the voyage out and home, except two com-panies, which are engaged for the duration of the war. Repatriation has already commenced&apos; and should be completed by the end of June next. (See Appendix No. 6.)(it) Non-Combatant Companies. These units may not be employed in the danger zone, nor on handling munitions of war. There are approximately 800 of this class of Labour, and though at one time they were considered to be some of the best Labour available, they have gradually deteriorated, and are now unreliable and restless. One of the reasons given for this was that men who had been sent home to serve a sentence inflicted by court-martial were, after a very short period, released to do work of &quot; national importance &apos;&apos; at home. The news of this at once reaches France, causing the men to become unsettled, which reacts on their work. These men require to be dealt with with a very firm hand.(j.) Civilians. There are approximately 12,000 French men and women and Belgian refugees employed under the Labour Directorate. They are engaged with the concurrence of the French Liaison Officers and the local maires. There does not appear, however, to be any uniformity in the rates of pay for this class of Labour in the different areas. I am of opinion that it is very advisable for this matter to be gone into, so that definite rates may be fixed for the different classes of work, which should apply to all cases, except perhaps in the danger zone, where an addi-tional amount per day might be given. It would certainly be desirable that the employer, in consultation with the Labour controller, should be enabled to give a bonus in the case of exceptional work. There is no reason why this class of Labour, especially the women, should not be employed on piece-work if so, rates throughout the country should be on a uniform basis. In the forests especially, the men are doing exceptionally good work, and fall in very readily with the views of the Forest Officers. The women, too, are working well, especially in some of the Ordnance Depots I saw, and their sphere of work might be extended with advantage. There is a tendency, however, to crowd them too much, and sufficient care is not taken to separate them from male Labour, particularly the prisoners of war.It was impressed on me in several places that more women could be employed if permission to do so were granted. I must point out, however, that there is an arrangement with the French Government as to the numbers that can be employed.Female Labour, such as the W.A.A.C., which is doing especially good work, could be efficiently employed with advantage in place of men, as, for instance, in the R.F.C. stores and&apos; similar places.(k.) Chinese Labour Companies. Generally I heard very good accounts of the work these companies were doing. It would appear, however, that there is a ten-dency to underrate the capabilities of these men; it must not be forgotten that they are &quot;A&quot; men, specially selected, of excellent physique, and who at home are accustomed to do a hard day&apos;s work. If properly supervised and handled, their output should be materially increased. Great care, however, must be taken that the work that is expected of them is thoroughly explained to them, and a reasonable time given for them to get into it.   In some cases I gathered this had not been done.
i A large proportion of Chinese suffer from an eye disease called &quot;trachoma.&quot; This is contagious, and the men affected are therefore segregated in special Trachoma Companies, located at selected stations, where special arrangements are1 made for treatment. Men suffering from conjunctivitis are similarly treated in Conjunctivitis Companies.   They should be kept apart from British and other coloured Labour.I heard that one or two companies were particularly restless at the present time, but I was unable to ascertain the real cause for this. I would point out that whilst the Chinese are very amenable if prtopelrly handled, they are extremely awkward to deal with if dissatisfaction once becomes acute amongst them, and they take some con siderable time to settle down again. Great care should be taken, therefore, that any signs of unrest shall be looked into at once and the reasons for them rectified.A certain number are being employed on skilled and semi-skilled work with excellent results, especially where the work is repetition work. In cases where the men are slack, sufficient use is not made of their work ticket, there being evidently a doubt amongst the officers as to the use of these. Wherever possible, task work should be given, but it will be necessary to see that it is carefully set, so as to ensure a full da,y&apos;s output. Better results could, I feel sure, be obtained by using the Chinese N.C.O.&apos;s more than they appear to be used at the present time.In the selection of the Chinese officers, too great a stress is put on the necessity of their speaking Chinese, regardless of other qualifications. This, I think, is a great mistake, and better results would be obtained by having officers who do not necessarily know the language, but who are accustomed to handle men, supplemented by an efficient number of intelligent interpreters. The interpreters should be used -as such, and not for directing the work, and they should also be given a proper status. There is, I understand, a corns!derable amount of dissatisfaction amongst them at present which cannot be beneficial to the work.There are 143 companies engaged under long period agreements, but none of these can be employed in the danger zone. As this is probably the best Labour in France, it would be desirable, should any further general increase be necessary, to augment the supply, and in this respect it is well to remember the repatriation of the South African and Indian companies to the extent of some 33,000 within the next few months.   (See Appendix No. 6.)(1.) Prisoners of War. These companies, of which there are 149, may not be employed within 30 kilometres of the front line, near ammunition dumps, nor in handling munitions of war. The use of them is further curtailed owing to the regulations in force as regards their escort. The quality of this Labour is good, especially so in the case of the skilled tradesmen. There is, however, a distinct lack of supervision, there being only two officers provided for each company, including the escort.Opinions varied as to the value of the German N.C.O.&apos;s; personally, however, I think that these should be used more than they appear to be at the present time, as better work should be obtained if the? men work more directly under their own N.C.O.&apos;s, but in this event it would be necessary to get the latter interested in the work they have to do. The best means to do this, in my opinion, would be to grant them a daily extra bonus, should their gang put in a really good day&apos;s work.This Labour is extremely uneconomical where small parties are required, as, . owing to the lack of supervision and to the shortage of escorts, larger gangs than the work warrants have to be employed. This is a bad principle, as it reacts adversely throughout the whole number. This was particularly noticeable in connection with the maintenance of the roads.Where these men are working alongside.&quot; free Labour,&quot; it is very desirable that they should work the same number of hours, otherwise there is disorganisation and friction.(5.) MAIN CONSIDERATIONS.In the previous paragraphs I have dealt with items which, whilst important in themselves, are, in my opinion, secondary when considering the Labour problem as a whole. The following, to which I have already briefly referred, are the main essentials which have to be considered.Si.q?ervision, The need for supervision was most noticeable throughout, the whole of my trip, and affects all classes of Labour. In dealing with supervision we have to consider both quantity and quality. With regard to quantity, this is in some oases woefully short; establishments have been cut down to such an extent that it is quite impossible to even attempt anything in the way of supervision.   On the
other hand, we came across establishments which were far too large for the work which was being done, and it is necessary that some scheme should be adopted whereby the establishments that affect Labour can be altered one way or the other without undue delay, which takes place at the present time.   In the case of Prisoners of War Companies, only two officers are allowed per company; this being so, it is obviously impossible for them to attempt anything in the form of supervision. Unless Labour is adequately supervised, the loss in efficiency is appalling.   As I have mentioned previously, the responsibility of having the work carried out should be thrown upon the officers of the Labour Companies; this means that the requisite number of officers and N.C.O.&apos;s to adequately look after the men must be available. It is not necessary for these men to have technical skill, but it is necessary for them to know how to handle Labour and what constitutes a fair day&apos;s work.   There appears to be too great a tendency to think that any officer is capable of handling a Labour Company, the result being that often I came across &quot;square pegs in round holes.&quot;   It is most desirable that in the case of foreign companies, and also in the case of Prisoners of War Companies, the actual giving of instructions to the men should be done by their own native N.C.O.&apos;s.   At present, there is a tendency to entirely ignore these, which is wrong, as the men will do better work when they are immediately controlled by their own N.C.O.&apos;s, and, further, the feeling that the men have an interest in their work is all to the good, and where the native N.C.O.&apos;s were used we at once noticed the difference.Dealing with the quality of supervision, it was also noticed that in many cases not only was this short, but also that the men who were supposed to have special qualifications did not possess them. This supervision should take the form more of having inspectors who could watch the work and give the necessary instructions to the Labour Company officers or N.C.O.&apos;s, and leave the actual work to be carried out by them. The selection of these men should be most carefully made, they should not be under the rank of sergeant, and some drastic alterations in the establishments may be necessary, so as to provide for the requisite numbers. I feel quite sure that from the skilled and specialised companies already in France there would be no difficulty in obtaining (the mumbeirs required.. In connection with this class of supervision I was particularly struck by the lack of means which exist to enable men to get about their areas to see that the work is being carried on properly. It is quite useless if the men are unable to get on to their jobs very frequently and at irregular times, especially the senior officers; and I would strongly urge, therefore, that the necessary motor cars and bicycles be at once provided. The cost of these would be nil compared with the effect that would arise by the officers getting round their work constantly.On the other hand, I appreciate the difficulty in supplying motor cars in all cases, and I would therefore suggest that where these cannot be provided the areas should be reduced to such a size as would enable the men to readily cover them. This would of course mean that an additional number of officers would be required, and would also entail an alteration in the establishments.I noticed that some officers, who were supposed to be specialised, whilst no doubt having the necessary qualifications, had had no experience in work of the magnitude of which they were put in charge, the result being that they took a very narrow view, and were afraid to launch out and put forward the recommendations which are necessary for economic work.In connection with supervision, there is one other matter to which I ought to refer, namely, the inadequacy of the guard in the Prisoners of War Companies where small parties of men are required. This was particularly noticeable on the roads, the result being that often 50 to 75 per cent, of the men were not doing use-ful work. This naturally reacts on the few men who are. On road work, except in the case of new roads &quot;or extremely heavy reconstruction work, large gangs can-not Usefully be employed, and therefore it is a waste of manpower to employ prisoners of war, unless some alteration can be made in the guard. In other cases, I heard of prisoners of war having to be kept in camp as they had not sufficient guard to take the men out. In some cases, however, it appears to me that the escort might be pooled to great advantage. Take, for instance, the quarries, where, by placing a ring of sentries round the top of them, the prisoners would be well in. view, and the number of escort greatly reduced in consequence.In conclusion, I may say that supervision is one of the most important items which has to be reconsidered in connection with the Labour problem, and I cannot too strongly urge, therefore, that this matter be taken in hand at once. In doing so, the points to be considered are: 
(a.) That the responsibility of the work be thrown upon the Labour Companies. (b.) To see that a sufficient number of officers and N.C.O.&apos;s be appointed toeach company to superintend the special work to be done, and that theyshoul4 remain constantly with their own company. (c.) That skilled technical knowledge be provided by means of an adequatenumber of inspectors. (d.) That the inspectors, and also where necessary the company officers, shouldhave ready means of getting about their work, frequently and at irregularperiods.(e.) That the escort question be reconsidered, so that the men, where necessary,can be worked in small gangs. (f.) That the number of specialised men should be increased, especially onroads and in the Forestry Department.Co-ordination. I was very much struck by the lack of complete co-ordination between the different departments that is so necessary, especially in connection with Labour. This want of co-ordination means that in case of a failure it is impossible to fix the blame on those who have been responsible for it. The Labour further suffers owing to the numerous cases of dual control which exist. To get the best results it is very necessary that there should be complete unity between everyone, and that ail the services should work together in the closest co-operation. Unless this is done in reviewing Labour, the reaction that takes place can be clearly seen. It often means unnecessary handling of material, misuse of space, and loss of man-power, due to the tendency the different departments have to keep the Labour they may be employing and to their not releasing it as rapidly as they should, owing, perhaps, to some slight disadvantage to which they might be put, which dis-advantage would be small compared to the benefits that might be derived from employing the Labour where most urgently needed.Again there has been a distinct inclination, either through want of knowledge or in view of the risk of demands being cut down, for more men to be requisitioned than could be usefully employed. We came across cases where, in spite of the numbers requisitioned having been considerably reduced, there was an excess of Labour. A lack of co-ordination also noticed was the failure to advise the different Directorates as to what men they would get, for what period, and also to give them ample warning when Labour had to be taken away due to special circumstances.At present the Labour Directorate deals only with the pooled Labour; it would be a distinct advantage if it dealt also with the specialised and semi-skilled Labour, although this may be attached to a particular unit. Closer co-ordinalion should also take place in connection with engineering stores, &amp;c, as this would not only help the circulation of supplies, but also tend to reduce stocks.Another point I would strongly urge is that there should be some ready system by which an exchange of ideas, particularly upon Labour matters, could readily take place between the different branches, and similarly as regards mechanical appliances. I think the loan of these latter from one department to another would at times help and be a means of saving Labour.Standardisation. The introduction of standardisation or uniformity would be of considerable benefit in connection with the many items that have a bearing upon Labour. Take for instance the question of outputs handled per man per hour or set for task work purposes, and also in the cases where extra pay to skilled men may be given.In connection with construction work I noticed a great lack of uniformity between the different buildings and also in the use of materials. Improvements could, I feel sure, be made in this respect, if it Were possible to get the closer co-operation between the different departments previously recommended.In connection with repair work, I noticed that the different Departments were doing, to all intents and purposes, identically the same class of work without there being, as far as I could, gather, any attempt at uniformity or an exchange of ideas and experience, which could only result beneficially.Rates of pay for the various classes of work throughout all army areas should be standardised.Relative Values. Another item which struck me very forcibly was the fact that there appeared to be no one who could take a wide comprehensive view of all matters that may in any form affect Labour, or which refer to more than one Department. Generally, the impression I got was that there was a tendency to take far too narrow an outlook.   Relatively minor alterations in the lay-out of yards, adjustments of

Generally, the impression I got was that there was a tendency to take far too narrow an outlook.  Relatively minor alterations in the lay-out of yards, adjustments of
areas, &amp;c., which might affect more than one Department, would, in some cases that I ^ saw, have been a distinct improvement from the man-power point of view. Similarly, as regards the use of mechanical appliances, whilst the expense of pur-chasing a special piece of machinery for one Department only might not appear reasonable, yet having regard to other work to be done elsewhere, it would be justifiable. It has to be remembered that it is often well worth while to put a Department or a part of the work to some slight disadvantage so as to secure better results elsewhere. The benefit to Labour as a whole has to be considered, and not to a small portion of it only.The relative values of the different types of Labour and nationalities is another point which requires consideration, and this should take the form of classifying all the pool Labour into different grades according to the work for which they are most suitable, and, as far as is practicable, they should always be kept on this class of work.(6.) CONCLUSIONS,It will be seen from the foregoing that I have dealt with the Labour problem on a broad basis, and that I have not attempted to go into isolated or specific cases where undoubtedly minor savings could be made. No doubt the effect of my visit and the discussions and suggestions which took place may already have been pro-ductive of some small improvements at the different places visited, but to get any real and general improvement a wider and more comprehensive view must be taken. So closely are the separate interests interwoven that failure in one place has far-reaching consequences in others. At present there is little hope of tracing quickly to its source the reason for any particular waste of energy, time or materials, or for applying universally the best ideas and most up-to-date methods that have been developed at isolated centres. It may be as well to point out that a saving of only the moderate estimate of, say 10 per cent., having regard to the enormous numbers of men employed, would amount to a large figure, both in men and money; this on the pool Labour alone would mean some 30,000 men, the cost of whom would exceed  5,000,000 per annum.Viewed in the light of a wide and varied business experience, I may state that from what I have seen this question of improved Labour efficiency in the army can be broadly dealt with by the same methods as experience has shown to be successful in the majority of large business undertakings The matter, however, cannot be dealt with satisfactorily piecemeal. I consider that consolidation and co-ordina-tion. between the many Departments, and better supervision, are essential, and also watchfulness over all classes of Labour (whether skilled, semi-skilled, or unskilled, and whether part of any particular branch or unit or not, excluding, of course, the men employed by the Fighting Forces). The relative value of lay-outs, designs, materials, mechanical appliances, and engineering stores, &amp;e, should come under the same category, so that the requirements of the Services can be seen in their true perspective.I recommend, therefore, that some one individual, who has had large and varied experience, should be appointed to undertake this duty, acting under the Quartermaster-General. This would have the further advantage of more closely connecting the Departments dealing with construction work and maintenance, which are large employers of Labour. It is the consolidation of the different Directorates and Departments that is necessary, and not the creation of new ones. It is also desirable that closer touch should be obtained between the War Office, the Treasury, and the numerous Departments in England. I am certain that the above, together with the other recommendations contained in the Report, would go a long way towards achieving the desired end, would simplify difficulties such as arise at the present time, enable responsibility to be readily fixed, produce better and more efficient results, and, in the end, be of benefit to all the Departments concerned, as well as create what is so very necessary, a proper Labour atmosphere.In conclusion, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Commander-in-Chief, the Quartermaster-General, and to everyone whom we met in France for the way in which I and my Staff were received, and for the ready help which was always given to us.I have, &amp;c.E.
