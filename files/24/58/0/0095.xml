COAL v. IRON-ORE

I have given careful consideration to the Minute (G.T.5120) by the Minister of Munitions, dated 14th July, 1918, on the question of Coal v. Iron Ore, and desire to submit to the War Cabinet the following Observations  on it.

Before dealing with the general question involved by the Minute, I should like to make the following remarks on the figures quoted in it:-

(1) The figures given for the output of 600 coal miners, so far as coal is concerned, are erroneous. The basis of 246 tons per man employed below and above ground is incorrect for several reasons, one of which is that the figure is that of output per man during the year 1917. In this year the output per ? fallen, largely owing to lack of shipping causing short time at the collieries in the exporting coalfields. The output per man below ground in coal mines is about 320 tons, taking all the underground labour, but only about 50% of the underground labour is actually composed of coal hewers or getters, so the withdrawal of one such getter would mean an annual loss of output of about 640 tons, or taking 600 men about 385,200 tons.

(2)It would be well to know too upon what date the get of 400,000 tons of Iron Ore per 600 coal miners per annum is based. Is this the output which would be obtained from 600 Iron Ore miners were this work devoted entirely to Iron Ore getting or is it based on the output per man employed below ground? I find that the output of Iron Ore per person employed below ground in Cumberland and Lancashire was 342 tons for 1913, or  205,200 tons for 600 persons. So far as Ironstone in Cleveland is concerned, for the same year the output per person employed below ground was 812 tons, or an average for Cumberland, Lancashire and Cleveland of 577 tons, or for 600 men - 346,200 tons.
(3)     I gatfcar from the last sentence in - paragraph 5 that the output per annum of the colliers working as Iron Ore miners would not he up to the average of the ordinary Iron ore miners, and I am in accord with this surmise.With regard to the whole question, I wish to state quite clearly that I cannot be a party of the transference of more coal miners from the collieries.   The position as regards coal at the present time is e ttost serious one and it is quite impossible at the moment to meet the requirements of our Allies, important munition works and industries generally.I would further point out thf t if at a tiroe when we are urging th^ men to increase their output and to avoid unnecessary absenteeism we at the same time take 600 coal miners to work in another industry, the men will once again get the impression that the   output of ooal is a secondary consideration.I would draw attention to the fact that slate miners, tin, lead, and other metalliferous ore miners make better Iron Ore or Ironstone getters than coal miners, and I would suggest that the Ministry-of i&quot;unitions should arrange for the transfer of miners from these industries or else follow the course we have been obliged to   3dpt to meet the coal question and get the v/ar Office to release from the Colours 600 low category pre-war Iron Ore or Ironstone minors *A.
