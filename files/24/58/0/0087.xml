WAR    CABINET.E, C R E yG.T. 5187 STATE CONTROL OF LIQ.U0R TRAFFICAcquisition of Licensed  Premises,,(Copy of letter from Secretary. Central Control Board,(Liquor Traffic] to &quot; Secretary, war Cabinet.)Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) Latymer House,134 Piccadilly, W. 1.7333/18 18th July, 1918,Sir, :I am directed by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) te forward for the consideration of the War Cabinet the enclosed memorandum setting out the difficulties with which the Board are faced in the prosecution of certain of the duties entrusted to them by Parliament.Not only are the Board hampered in finally completing (except under extravagant financial conditions) their scheme of direct oontrol in the Carlisle area, but they are practically precluded from entertaining any request made by responsible authorities to consider the establishment of direct State control in new areas,.    They have alreatty had to reply in this sense to a request from the Admiralty in regard to Chepstow, while it is rapidly becoming increasingly evident that a demand for similar action may at any moment be pressed upon them in the interests ot the efficiency of the British and American Naval forces in certain districts in the North of Sootland.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(sd)   J,C, SYKES,The Secretary, Secretary.The War Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.MEMORANDUM BY   THE   CENTRAL   CONTROL  BOARD   (LIQUOR   TRACTIC)\It ie necessary to draw the attention of the War Cabinet o the very serious difficultiee which arise as the result of the recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in the oaBe of the Cannon Brewery Co. Ltd., v the Contral Control Board (Liquor Traffic),  hie judgment (confirming Mr. Justice Younger&apos;s judgment deliver ed in July last) paralyses the power of the Central Control Boar to proceed with the acquisition of licensed premises where necessary as a war emergency measure for the purpose of the direct State control of the liquor traffic.
2. While the JDefonce of the Realm (Amendment)(Wo.3)   Act,191$, was pas-sing through Parliament, the necessity of giving &quot;the Board power to undertake the permanent acquisition of licena-ed premises was emphasised in the discussions, and was explained on behalf of the Government, and it was further stated that, while it was the Government&apos;a intention that all questions of compensation should be so tiled by the Duke Commission, it was unnecessary to make express provision in the Bill either for the establishment of the Commission as the compensation tribunal or for the principles tp be followed in assessing compensation.3. The Court of Appeal, however, has now ruled out theDuke Commission as the compensation tribunal, and has held that, as the Act of 1915 is silent on the subject of compensation, the Lands Clauses Acts must be taken to be incorporated.   This has two main results.(l)     In the first place, since the Lands Clauses Acts are incorporated automatically, and consequently, . without any of the usual statutory safeguards and modifications, the prices to be paid by the Central Control Board must be on a scale substantially higher than it has now for many years been customary to allow in the case of property acquired for public purposes, whether under Defence of the Realm or under pre-war legislation.   The Board have never regarded it as part of their function to determine or advise upon the principles or basis upon which compensation should be assessed, but they do not think they would be justi-fied, except with the full knowledge and approval of the liBX Cabinet, in undertaking the purchase of property on Lands Clauses terms,(2)     More serious still, however, from the point of view of the control of the liquor traffic as a war measure, is the doubt which has beon thrown by tne judgment of the Master of the Rolls upon the validity of the Regulations which prescribe the procedure by which the Board obtain possession of property which it is deemed necessary or expedient to acquire.   It was recognised in 1915; and it is in fact necessary for the effective exercise of the Baard&apos;s powers, that they should be able to obtain possession by some rapid and summary procedure such as was prescribed by the Defence of the Realm (Liquor Control] Regulations which were framed and issued in pursuance of the Act of 1915.    But, while the judgment stands, any attempt on the part of the Board to act under these Regulations (except in friendly and agreed cases) would be to risk if not to invite opposition and litigation which would almost certainly be successful to the extent of inde-finitely delaying the Board&apos;s entry upon the premises intended to be taken.   On the other hand, the procedure for obtaining possession prescribed by the Lando Clauses Act is so dilatory that, if thi3 is the only procedure available, the Board&apos;s power of acquisition is useless for the purposes for which it was intended.4. It is intended to appeal against the judgment, but aninterval of several months must elapse before the judgment of the House of Lords can be obtained.   An appeal having been lodged, it is probable that some progress may be made during this interval in the settlement by agreement of cases where the-Board are already in possession and where the question of price is still under negotiation.   But it must not be expected that the judgment of the House of Lords, when given, will reinstate
the Commission as the compensation tribunal, and it is by no means impossible that the Regulations which have formed the basis of the Board18 action may be definitely deolared invalid.5. It followeihat, if the War Cabinet desire the Board tobe in a poetion to obtain prompt possession of licensed premises, the acquisition of which may appear necessary for the proper con-trol of the liquor traffic, they must obtain legislation to rectify the situation resulting from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.   On the &quot;assumption that the basis of compensation for the permanent acquisition of licensed premises should be the same as that recently sanctioned by Parliament for other types of property in the Defence of the Bealm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, the following Draft represents the substance of the legislation which it appears desirable to enact&apos;.Draft,.&quot;The procedure for the compulsory acquisition of any premises or business or any interest therein by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) under the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (Ho.3) Act, 1915, shall be that prescribed by the regulations made un-der that Act (which regulations are hereby declared to have been duly made), but questions of disputed compensation inxelation to such acquisition shall be settled in acoordance with the provisions as to com-penbation in the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, and those provisions shall apply accordingly with the necessary modifications.&quot;Provided that nothing in this section shall affect any oase in which thecompensation payable in respect of any premises, business or interest,so acquired has, before the passing of this Act, been fixed in any other manner.&quot;
