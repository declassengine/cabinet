Copy of letter from the Hon^Stanley^ M.g. to the Prime MinisterJOINT WAR COMMITTEE.BRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETY, and THE ORDER OF ST. JOHN OF JERUSALEM IN ENGLAND, 83, PALL MALL,LONDON, S.W.16th July, 1918.Sir,On the 26th January 1916 I addressed a letter to the Prime Minister on behalf of the Joint Wax Committee of the British Red Cross and tho Order of St. John urging that a Ministry of Prisonors should be set up to look after and co-ordinate all work relating to Prisoners of War, both in enemy countries and in this country.   The Prime Minister at that time did not see fit to appoint a Minister, but now that the question has been mooted again I venture once more to bring the suggestion to your notice.It is quite impossible that questions affecting Prisoners shoull be dealt with satisfactorily under the existing arrangement, and the Joint War Committee feel that the only solution is the appointment of a Minister, of Cabinot rank, who shall be responsible for all Prisoner questions at home and abroad.I amSir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) ARTHUR STANLEY. Chairman.The Rt. Hon. The Prime Minister, 10, Downing Street, S.W.1.
