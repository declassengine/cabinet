ONFH&amp;ENTIAL.i/5(This Document-Ib the Property of GolOIiel W, Dlllj JOMann,c^^^^^      ,   78SfiMM.IS.^II-Q,P     ME   PP AIRS. MINISTRY OP HEALTH BILL.tfiaaVi      -----------------------I -     ZTWr    Memorandum by.....the Home se oretary.Apart from the questions raised by the President of the Local Government Board, ipon which I am in agreement with him, the following points appear to me to deserve jonsideration,1. Tho Bill only proposes to amalgamate the Local Government Board and the Insurance !ommissioners under the title of a Minister of Health, and to transfer to the Minister some unimportant powers of tho Board of Education and the Privy Council.    This change of machinery will not save life, and will disappoint the public who have been led to xpeot great things,    The Minister of Health, if one is set up, should from the beginning be entrusted with larger powers for enforcing the sanitary laws and for other purposes connected with the public health,2, Is it clear that the Insurance Commissioners should be merged in the Ministry of Health, and not retained as a statutory body under the control of the Ministry?3. Clause 2, subsections (2) and (3) provide for the transfer of other unspecified sowers to and from the Minister of Health by Orders in Council,     This mode of legis-lation is open to oriticism, and leaves other departments in uncertainty.    The powers capable of being transferred should be specified in a sohedule, even though the actual transfer may be postponed to a future date.4. Sohedu&amp;e 1, paragraph 1, provides only that, if an Aot is hereinafter passed for revising the poor law, then the poor law powers of the Ministry of Health may be trans-ferred by Order in Counoil.    Such a provision should not be made in advance, but should be contained in the Act revising the poor law.    I think a decision as to the future of the poor law should be taken now and embodied in this Bill.5. Sohedule 1, Paragraphs 2 and 3, provide for still more Orders in Counoil,   Sorely these questions could be dealt with now by substantive legislation,6, The Secretary for Scotland raises important points as to the application of the Bill to Scotland, and advocates a new departure in the administration of Scottish affairs.     I doubt whether this Bill should be used for all the purposes mentioned in his memorandum;   but certainly the position of Scotland and Ireland under the Bill should be considered and determined before the Bill is introduced.Upon the while it appears to me that it would be a mistake to introduce the Bill in its present form.    It should be revised during the Recess, and if agreed should be introduced in the autumn.    Whether a Bill of this importance can be passed in the present Session may be doubtful; but at least it can be put forward for publio criticism frith a view to its being passed next year.G. 0. ;th July, 1918.
