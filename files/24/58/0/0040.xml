July 1.918.SECRET.-     ACG.T.-5140.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending 17th July, 1918.Summary.Tart I: General Remarks.The resolutions of the Miners&apos; Conference at Southport and the settlement of the strike in the aircraft works are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on India, on Russian affairs, on the restriction of aliens, on the Labour Party, on Whitley Councils, and on sundry other matters, is described.Part III.: District Reports.The unrest of the last few weeks has perhaps become less acute, but Yorkshire and East Midlands and the North-Western area are still disturbed.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. With the close of the aircraft strike no serious strike is in progress, though several thousand cotton operatives at Wigan are out on the question of an advance in wages.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The dispute by the National Council of Societies representing Mine Workers other than Miners continues; otherwise no serious dispute is in progress.I.-General Remarks.The Miners&apos; Conference.The Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain was held at. Southport during the past week, and was remarkable for the extreme character of some of the resolutions which were passed. The one recommending nationalisation of the mines is a standing item of the agenda of these conferences. There were, however, several new resolutions of a type which illustrate the existing temper of the members of the Federation. Of these, three which are of the utmost importance deal with wages, and one with hours. As to wages, probably the most important is one which resolved that the machinery for dealing with the general wage should be centralised in the National Federation. The effect of this resolution, if its terms were accepted, would be the abolition of all the local Conciliation Boards and their replacement by a National Wage Board. The resolution, does not suggest as a result that district wages should be equalised in all areas, although this conclusion is accepted by the Labour correspondent of the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; in a somewhat alarmist article dealing with the conference. It seems, however, undoubted that the result of any such change in the machinery of wage determination must tend to equalisation of wages throughout the -country, a policy which could not but result in the closure of many of the less profitable pits.Another resolution demanded the amendment of the Minimum Wage Act in order to provide for a minimum daily wage on time rates of 10s.[1100-38] B
The third resolution of a serious nature, (Sealing -with wages, provided that negotiations should at once commence for six days&apos; wages for a five-day week. Doubtless an agitation, in this sense will now be commenced.A further resolution provided for a special conference, in the first place, of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and afterwards of the Triple Alliance, in order to compel legislation for the introduction of a six-hour day within four weeks of the declaration of peace. The argument alleged in favour of this measure was the impossi-bility that the mines could absorb all the Labour which would be set free at the close of the war if an eight-hour day continued to be the rule.The cumulative impression created by these resolutions is that they are the symptom of a deliberate policy to compel the expropriation of the mine-owner, and this policy was indeed declared by Mr. Hodges in proposing one of the resolutions. He said he was fully aware of the burden which would be thrown on the public by maintenance of the existing rate of wages combined with the reduction of hours to six per day for a five-day-week, but the question was whether the public was always to bear the burden of main-taining the average rate of profit of the mine-owner. He continued : &quot; If we have a six-hours working day and wages and selling prices remain the same, the coal-owner passes automatically out of this industry.&quot;Miners are, of course, in a peculiarly powerful position to compel concessions at the present time, and the experience of successful demands in the past is not likely to prevent them making further demands in the future, however unreasonable those demands may be. It must be anticipated that the policy outlined in these resolutions will be pressed and that times of considerable difficulty in dealing with these questions. are certain to occur in the future. It is, therefore, specially desirable that a definite policy should be adopted and when adopted should be pursued.It is important, also, to realise that the Miners&apos; Federation has no intention of allowing the idiosyncracies of district executives to interfere with the policy of the Federation. Among the resolutions passed was one instructing district authorities to refuse to conclude any wages agreements after the war which would result in a reduction of the rate of wages in the pits, including all special additions due to the rise in prices during the war. The power of the Federation in bargaining is of itself very great and, in the matter of general principles affecting wages and hours such as those laid down in the resolutions of this Conference, there can be little doubt that the support of the other members of the Triple Alliance, if not already secured, is practically certain.Strike in the Aircraft Works.The settlement of the strike among London aircraft works amounted to a complete victory for the unauthorised committee and a corresponding defeat for the constitutional unions. The strikers refused to return to work without Rock, the shop steward, whose dismissal was the cause of the strike, even with the promise of immediate arbitration on the question of that dismissal. The settlement provided that Rock should be reinstated when the Ministry of Munitions was in effective control of the works, and the question of his dismissal decided as a result of enquiry by the Ministry of Labour. Following the Tredegar case, the terms of settlement cannot fail even, further to reduce the waning power of the organised trade unions in the Munitions [ndustry.II. press comments.India.Much interest is taken in the Indian Blue Book, and the advance proposed is welcomed, though details are reserved. The &quot; Clarion &quot; approves of the recognition of the principles of self-determination, and the &quot; Herald &quot; says this is the only criterion by which to judge the proposals. It promises to publish notes by prominent Indians, and does not wish to hear any remarks by Europeans. An article by St. JSihal Singh is printed, which describes the report as a severe defeat to the forces of darkness. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; hopes that Mr. Montagu will take action on a memorial from Bombay textile workers, praying for better conditions of labour.Count Mirbach.The assassination of Count Mirbach is condemned, but its motive is the subjeet of speculation, the &quot; Call,&quot; regarding it as the first stroke of this sort dealt by the
trevolutionary socialists of the Left Wing against the Soviet Government, notes that it has been foiled without difficulty. The crime was due to spies of foreign origin, anxious to embroil Russia with Germany. Writing in the &quot;Herald&quot; Mr. Brailsfbrd interprets the incident as a sign oi uncontrollable exasperation among the Russian opposition. It was presumably intended to provoke German reprisals, and thus cause intervention by the Allies. An-editorial article says that the political results are not likely to justify it. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; agrees with Mr. Brailsford as to the probable action by Germany, and praises the Soviet Government for repudiating and deploring the outrage. &quot;Justice,&quot; while doubtful as to the cause, is certain that the murder will not help the emancipation of Russia from German tyranny.Russia.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; continues his advice to the Allies on the subject of Prussia. &apos; Like the Labour Party, the Allies have been funda-mentally wrong in considering only the military aspect of the war. The Allies should let it be known that the Brest-Litovsk arrangement will be reconsidered at the Peace Conference. All ideas of military intervention should be dropped. If Kerensky asks for support it should be given in material, food, and organising ability, but not by an expeditionary force.The &quot; Call &quot; protests against the reported landing of a British armed detachment at Murmansk, as the Allies cannot afford fresh expeditions.Peace.A number of papers (the &quot;Herald,&quot; &quot;Call,&quot; and the &apos;&apos; Labour Leader&quot;) criticise the Premier^ speech on the 4th July. The comments are directed against Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s delay in finding himself in agreement with President Wilson, against his obstinacy in not taking advantage of peace terms already offered, and his inaccuracy in saying that the Kaiser had never consented to treat.The Internationale.In the &quot; Call&quot; a series of articles has commenced to discuss reconstruction of the Internationale, and expressions of opinion are invited. The failure of the Internationale at the outset of war is admitted, and the meetings at Zimmerwald, Kienthal, and Stockholm are described as inconclusive. A more definite constitution of the Society is suggested with frequent sessions, machinery for enforcing decisions in view of the proposed League of Nations, and a Joint International Exchequer. The aim is to make the Internationale a real proletarian world power.Aliens.No labour paper agrees with the proposals for further restrictions. The &quot; Call&quot; thinks that nothing could be imagined more mean and cruel than the recom-mendations, while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; sums up the result as a fresh submission by Government to the Northcliffe press.Labour.Comment this week is scattered and desultory. In the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; appears an analysis of the Labour muvement in Ireland. The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union is growing, and is attracting both agricultural and town workers. Trade Councils are also extending. Further developments seem to depend on local solidarity of all workers rather than on the unification of workers in a single industry. There is no Labour M.P., and Labour councillors and guardians are few.Waring and Gillows.Dealing with the London aeroplane factory strike the &quot; New Statesman &quot; draws the lesson that employers must realise the change in their own status, and must not dismiss employees unheard. The &quot;Herald&quot; criticises the control of munition works, partly by a Government Department and partly by private firms.Labour Party.&quot;Justice&quot; is agitated by the growing signs of disruption in the Labour Party. Is the new Lansdowne Party only Mr. Snowden&apos;s new democratic party under another
title, and will the Labour Party executive take up the same attitude towards it as towards the Trade Union Labour Party ? Mr. Webb&apos;s appeal to America for funds is challenged as unauthorised, and injurious to the Labour Party.Whitley Councils.The &quot; Shop Assistant,&quot; while agreeing with critics who argue that organised effort will gain more than any other means, is determined to use all machinery available to improve the state of sweated workers.   The Government interdepartmental committee to examine the question of councils does not satisfy the &quot; Postal and , Telegraph Record,&quot; and these misgivings are shared by the &quot; Cotton Factory Times.&quot;Shop Stewards&quot; Solidarity &quot; calls on the rank and file to bestir themselves or the movement will lose its revolutionarv character.Lord Rhondda.Every paper expresses gratitude to the late Lord Rhondda for his services. &quot; Justice &quot; describes him as fighting a desperately uphill fight against Mr. Lloyd George and the War Cabinet. While laying stress on Socialist opposition to Lord Rhondda as a capitalist, Mr. Hyndman praises him for advancing to the half-way stage of bureaucratic Socialism.Food.In the &quot; Call&quot; Britains debt to Ireland for assistance iu food supplies is explained. If the Irish labourer and small farmer have opposed conscription, they have at all events aided British workers by increasing food-stocks. &quot;Justice&quot; welcomes. the success of public kitchens as a sign of the growth of Socialism, and sneers at Government officials for replacing the term Communal by that of National. Mr. Hyndman regrets the increase of 2d. a lb. in margarine, which cannot be avoided unless either quality is reduced or the loss is borne by the State. Naturally he prefers the latter course.   An immediate increase in the price of meat will cause riots.III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.Some improvement is evident in this district, and the trouble&apos; in the aircraft industry seems now to have subsided. Shop stewards at Woolwich claim the settlement as a big victory.The Pro-Ally Labour Demonstration in Trafalgar Square on the 13th June was attended by some thousands of people, and enthusiastic speeches were made in favour of the prosecution of the war.The London Trades Council discussed the question of peace negotiations at a recent meeting, and a resolution was passed demanding that the Government shall negotiate for an armistice with a view to discussing peace terms.A meeting of London railwaymen, at which about 10,000 men were present, passed recently an indignant resolution of protest against the employment of women in signal-boxes, on the ground that women are unsuited by temperament for such work.West Midlands.Conditions in this area continue to be satisfactory. Attempts to bring out aircraft workers in sympathy with the London strike were unsuccessful. It was, however, expected that a half-day strike upon the dilutee question would take place on the 13th, and the employees of several firms had handed in their notices to this effect.J. T. Murphy addressed a meeting of the Birmingham Trades&apos; Council on the 7th upon the work of the shop stewards. The meeting appears to have been well attended, and gave Murphy a cordial reception.
Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation in this area is somewhat disturbed, and various signs of unrest have appeared.   &apos;A movement is spreading among all unions represented on the Bradford Trades&apos; Council to secure a 45-hour working week without any reduction of rates. An agreement for a 50-hour week, which had been arrived at in the engineering trade, is not recognised by various textile associations, and this failure has already led to a strike of mechanics in textile factories at Bradford. The garment wporkers suggest a review of the whole question of wages as a result of the increased cost of foodstuffs.^The demand for an advance of 5s. weekly will probably result in a strike of carmen and motormen in Bradford, though in some cases the employers have already decided to yield to their demands, owing to the importance of the work upon which they are engaged. It is also expected that about 1,500 co-operative employees in the Bradford, Keighley, and Skipton districts will hand in notices to strike for increased wages, though the Union officials are averse to such a course.North-Western.Considerable disturbance still prevails in this area, though the strike of Liverpool tramwaymen has ceased on an agreement to arbitrate.The miners&apos; conference at Southport is dealt with in Part I of this report.The dockers at Bootle are showing signs of unrest, their grievance being that the last award made to them by the Committee on Production is not being paid by some employers.   A strike is threatened in consequence.Some of the juniors of the Mersey Quay and Carters&apos; Union are at present on strike owing to the failure to include them in the last award.The Mersey Reconstruction Committee held a meeting on the 1 Ith. As regards the recent wage application, the chairman pointed out that the men should &quot;have given the Committee on Production at least a fortnight in which to publish their award, and stated that he considered it to be the duty of&apos;the Reconstruction Committee to keep them in hand. A further discussion arose as to the statement of the A.S.E. that any resolutions passed at the Reconstruction Committee&apos;s mass meeting would not be binding upon A.S.E. members. This announcement the chairman considered regrettable, as resolutions were merely the expressed opinion of the rank and file, and the Recon-. struction Committee, which was not a controlling body, could give no orders.- Con-, siderable discontent is expressed at the action of the Cotton Control Board in putting an end to the Rota system. Stoppages would have taken place in Oldham and other districts on Saturday next, but the Board of Trade have decided to continue the system for two weeks, to give time for further consideration.Northern.The situation in this area is in general very calm.A branch of the Newcastle A.S.E. have, however, passed a resolution protesting against the calling up of apprentices for enlistment in the infantry, while the pledge to withdraw all dilutees simultaneously is ignored. .   -The North-Eastern railwaymen at Darlington are discontented with the result of a recent wages application, owing to the fact that the offer of the Railway Company does not include all grades of employees.South Wales.Conditions in this -district remain quiet and satisfactory, and little unrest of any kind is reported.A joint meeting of the South Wales Steel Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Iron and Steel Trades&apos; Confederation at Swansea, on the 12th, agreed upon various advances in the trade.Scotland. \Little unrest is reported from this district, and the Clyde shipyards are closed for the annual holiday from the 11th to the 23rd July. The only signs of discontent are a demand from riveters for an increase of 20 per cent., and dissatisfaction with the Government for closing public houses during the holidays.[1100-38]c
IV......Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The general situation has improve;!, though several important strikes have been in progress recently.The Shipyard Labour Department has seven new stoppages to report, involving 958 men.Strikes have occurred at Messrs. Barclay Carle and A. Stephen and Sons, Govan, at Messrs. Bartram and Sons, Sunderlancl, and at Messrs. Dowson and Co., Tyne Dock, owing to an award of the Committee on Production granting only 10 per cent, advance to &quot;lieu&quot; workers, who had received no advance corresponding to the advances on. price lists during the war.The Ministry of Munitions reports a total of 26,075 men involved in strikes for the week ending the 10th July.The strike in the aircraft industry in London ended on the 10th July upon the Ministry of Munitions taking over control of the works, and on the reinstatement of Rock. The trouble had, however, already spread to Messrs. Waring and Cillow&apos;s aircraft works at Liverpool, where a short strike occurred.A strike of 500 workpeople took place at Messrs. J. S. White and Co., Cowes, on account of the dismissal of a girl by a forewoman. The strikers resumed work upon the reinstatement of the girl.At Messrs. Armstrong and Whitworth&apos;s Works, Gateshead, a strike of 500 employees occurred, owing to the dismissal of a worker for insubordination. The manager consented to reinstate the woman pending an investigation, but the shop stewards mean-while started an agitation for the dismissal of the foreman who had originally discharged her, and the workers came out on the ] oth. The general opinion is that the shop stewards have not acted in consultation with the Union officials, and the majority of the workers disagree with the strike.The War Office Contracts Department has only two new stoppages of work to report.The more important of these is a strike in the nut and bolt trade at Darlaston, where the men are demanding a revision of piecework rates; the matter was previously under discussion, when the men refused to accept the 1\ per cent, in satisfaction of their claims. The present stoppage is unauthorised by the Union.The second is a somewhat unimportant strike of women employees in the underwear industry in the Stewarton district of Scotland, where the workers are demanding a piece-rate of 5s. 9d.The Coal Controller reports eight new stoppages of work, involving in all about 14,133 men.   Work has already been resumed in seven cases.Two small disputes still remain unsettled in Scotland, one of which is upon a question of wages and the other of tonnage rates. In both cases the number of men involved is small.Trouble has arisen among cotton operatives in North-East Lancashire, Manchester and Wigan with regard to the interpretation of the recent increase of 25 per, cent, in wages, and several thousands are now on strike. Many more.are on notice to leave this week-end.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard, Labour Department reports 26 new and 114 old controversial cases ; of these &apos;6l have now been settled.Trouble is reported at Messrs. Cox and Co. in the Bristol area owing to a refusal by the A.S.E. to permit dilution. This firm has been attempting to train unskilled men as fitters and turners, but the A.S.E. refuse to allow tradesmen to instruct such men.The Ministry of Munitions reports that at Messrs. Austin&apos;s works the responsible trade union officials are anxious that similar action should be taken by the Government as has been taken in the case of Messrs. Waring and Gillow. In the meantime an experienced labour manager has been appointed.The system of placing embargoes upon firms against the employment of additional labour without a licence is causing unrest at Coventry, owing to the fear of industrial conscription. The skilled workers have given their leaders forty-eight hours in which to secure the cancellation of the orders, so far as they affect the Daimler Works, the Triumph Cycle Works, the Siddeley-Deasy Motor Works, and Messrs. Hotchkiss and Co., failing which they threaten joint action to enforce their claim. Much excitement over the same matter also prevails in Manchester and Birmingham.
The War Office Contracts Department has no new controversial cases to report.No fresh cases of dispute are reported by the Coal Controller,The National Council of Societies representing Mine Workers other than Minersmet the Prime Minister on the 12th, but refused to accept the small concession whichwas offered.   A further meeting is to be held on the 17th.The Committee on Production has heard thirty-eight cases in London during the past week.Of these the most important were a claim by the&apos; Birmingham Engineering Committee for the revision of the day-work bonus paid to employees in the gun section of the Austin Motor Company, a claim by the dockers of the Port of London Authority for total war wages of 20s. a week and for the 12^ per cent, bonus, and a claim by the Boilermakers&apos; Society and the National Employers&apos; Federation for an advance of 10s. a week to the Society&apos;s members in Staffordshire, Shropshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire.The Chief Industrial Commissioner has had 133 new differences reported to him during the week. A total of ninety-five cases have been referred to arbitration or settled.G. H. ROBERTS.
