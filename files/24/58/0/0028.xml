Whatever Bill the Government elaot to introduce must be the Bill of the Government and they commit themselves to the clauses and to the policy embodied in the clauses.    It is therefors important that the provisions of the Bill should be well considered before they are brought in.    It ia particularly necessary that the present Bill should be agreed upon by all the Departments whose functions it may touoh.    It ia not enough for the Minister of Reconetruction to say that such and suoh a clause is put in to conciliate suoh an such an interest ox is the price at which such an such an opposition oan be withdrawn. Until the Bill is before the House it is speculative to say what la the strength of a particular interest or faction, and it is therefore unwise to admit clauses merely to appease a section of public opinion unless the Government either accept their views or feel that their opposition cannot be withstood.3.    It is also necessary for the Government to have cone to some decision on the scope and purpose of the Bill.    The objeot of the measure aa described in the Report of the Sub-Committee of which Dr. Addison 713.2 the Chairman, was to secure the more efficient working of existing public health services.    By oomaon consent it is agreed that it shall only extend to the powers of the Central Government relating to Health.    The several Depart-mente enumerated in the Report as concerned with tho public health are the Local Government Board, the English and Welsh Insurance Commissions, the Board of Education, the Ministry of Pensions, the Home Office, the Board of Trade, the Board of Agriculture, the Privy Council, the Admiralty and the War Office.    All the arguments currently used in support&apos;of a Ministry of Health are based on the idea of co-ordination.    Though I am in favour of a Ministry of Health, I do not believe that complete co-ordination of the health functions of the Central Government In one water-tight compartment would ever be possible.    But whatever we are to do we must know what we are doing and with what functions under what Departmenta we are proposing to deal.3.    The comments on the Bill that follow are made mainly with two objects, one to anticipate points whioh I feel sure will be raised and will have to be answered if the Bill 13 intro-dueed as it stands, and the other to avoid the inclusion of unnecessary matter.Clause 1.-  It ia not possible to divorce Health from local Government of which it forms 00 large a part and with which it is inextricably intertwined.    Practically all the Local Authorities whether Councils of Counties, Boroughs, Districts or Parishes or Boards of Guardians are concerned in greater or leas decree with health.    And they all are also engaged with questions not related to health.    Similarly the Local Government Board, though largely occupied with health Questions, deals with a variety of topics not specially relating to health.    Thus it sanctions loans for all purposes, approves byelawe on a variety of subjects, authorises alienation of lands, deals with highways, rating, audit, old age pensions, local statistics, looal Aots &amp;e* &amp;e.    I therefore think it would be more appropriate to call the Minister the &quot;Minister of Looal Government and Health&quot;.Clause 3.-  I think this clause should defint with
mxttmmt elearuees th* functions whioa **f te pass txm ether Departments to the new Ministry either at once or aubietfuently, It my be a question whether a time limit should be imposed for the tranefer of the servioes whioh axe not to pass at onoo. Parlieaent and the Departments affected will I think claim to know what are the intentions of the Government.    RemoBbering that the whole of the case for a Centralised Ministry of Health is argutft on the vital necessity of immediately co-ordinating in on,a Department the Health functions of some dogen Departwente, 1 can hardly suppose that questions will not be asked as to the possible teediata transfer to the neT Ministry of the followljg powers?-(a) The powers of the Board of Education with reference to the inspection and treatment of the ailments of school ohildrex.1(b) The powers of the Home Office in relation to the B$&amp;rd Of Control and in relation to infant lifs protectionsIt))  The powers of the Privy Council under the Hedioal Acts ; and the tlidwives Acts:(d) -The powers of the Board of Agriculture in regard to milk and other foo&amp;sj .and as to the probable, transfer within a ehort period of?-(a)  The powers of ths Minister of Pensions in regard to the treatment of sick and disabled men;(bj  The powers of the Board of Trade in regard to the i health of the Mercantile Marine?(o)  The powers of the Home Office relating to tnoee wfca / work in Factories and Mines. &apos;It Is net possible to base the Bill on the need for co-ordination and to leave all these powers uncoordinated and the possibility or prabability of-their co-ordination a nebulous blank.    The proper course as it seems to mi is to indioate (a) the&apos; powers which are to be transferred at once and lb) the powers which are to be transferred within a fixed time, setting each . category of powers out in the Bill.I m not in favour of any transfer, from the Ministry of local Government and Health of powers not strictly oonoented &apos;   with health.    Major Aster attested for. example that audit might ^ be transferred.    This would be a most retrograde step. The malt Of the accounts of local authorities who. are the Public Health Authorities should obviously be under the control of &quot;the Minister ^ who is in charge of the concerns of those Authorities. ,The course which I am disposed to suggest is that, before any Bill is circulated, the Home Affairs Committee should .a communicate with all the Ministers concerned and should invite them to oonfsr on the question of the extent of powers to be transferred.    When this is done there would be no difficulty in- drafting the necessary clauses.    Unless this is done amendments may be sprung on ue for the transfer of powers of -various depart-aents, to which it will be difficult to reply.Clause gr.-    I assume that this is regarded as
necessary if all the powers of the Insurance Commissioners are transferred. I should myself have preferred a leee ambitious eoheme which would have rendered thie olauee unnecessary.Clause 4,-   I have already urged ray objections to this clause on oonetitutional grounds.    I think the olauee should he emitted.    If it be retained, it should be in the following terms:-    ttIt shall be lawful for the Minister to &quot;establish an Advisory Oounoil for advising him oh any matter &quot;which he may think fit to refer to them&quot;.    An Order in Oounoil is unnecessary.    The initiative must lie with the Minister and with no one else, and he must have the right of determining the appointment of any member of the Advisory Council.    To suggest, as appears to be intended, that members of the Council shall be nominated by the Crown for fixed periods independently of tho Minister is to put him into an almost untenable position, could dismiss his permanent officials but could not get rid of members of his Consultative Committee,Clause 5.*    Thie clause is not I conceive necessary to the Bill.    Subject to the consent of the Treasury, and of tat House of Commons in connection with his Vote, the Minister can maintain a branch office away from London if it is necessary. The clause as drafted reads rather as though it jvaa Intended to establish a new office.    I presume all that is really contemplated is the continuance of a National Health Insurance Offioe at Cardiff.*trt    j^?gt( 8chedule.
