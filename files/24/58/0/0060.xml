Tne farming operations for the week consisted &apos; of hay making, steam cultivating seeds leys, mowing thistles on gapass, hosing roots and earthing up potatoes.    The weather broke during the week with thunderstorms and rain, which will do good 80 far as the roots and spring corn &quot;are concerned, but unfortunately it was inopportune as hay-making operations were in progress.   The hay is all in stack with the exception of two fields whioh are ready for loading and partly carried, and one which has not yet been cut but waiting for favourable weather, The crops, produce and stock disposed of during the week included 48$  qrs. wheat, 15 qrs. beans, 24 cwt. 3 qrs. 19 Ibsi wool, 64 lbs. butter, 110 pints milk, 21 duoklings, 1 doz. chicks and 232 eggs.iHeath Hill.    The fins weather ended early in the week and very little further progress was made with the hay harvest, the time was, however, spent in completing mangold hoeing, top dressing both that crop and the potatoes with nitrate of soda, and clearing away from the stations a considerable collection of goods and implements.    All the cattle on the estate are progressing satisfactorily and taken as a whole the crops are looking well, the recent rains being very beneficial.Holbeach*    The horses are busy spraying potatoes.    The cattle are progressing satisfactorily.    Six more pigs have been sold, and the remainder are beins kept for stubbling after harvest.    Mares and foals are doing well.    The settlers continue to make satisfactory progress.Kelhain Estate ,report. excellent hay, when sunshine * resultsow&apos;1Since the last statement there is very little to Generally speaking the hay crop has been carted in&apos; condition with the exception of the first lot of seed Operations w4re severely handicapped by lack of The Estate Manager reports a most satisfactory on the land where sulphate of aranonia or basic slag was&apos; the yield being at least SQ$ higher than on the unmanured land&quot;.    With the exception- of one, or two, the Prisoners of War are working well, and lend themselves admirably to our method of dealing with hay.    The cattle are doing well, especially as&apos; regards the North Country oows, heifers and calves,    A shepherd has now been engaged and the sheep are in good condition in spite of the fact that up till now it has been impossible to find a suitable shepherd.fflax Production Branch.The flax harvest is now in full swing in the Somerset and Peterborough centres.    Bleven camps in Somerset are fully organized and equipped, and, notwithstanding adverse weather conditions, the workers, including &quot;1375 women, are comfortably housed under canvas and their health is excellent.    In the Peterborough centre twenty-on-3 camps, including 3 for women and 15 for boy scouts are now occupied.    Major General Sir Robert Baden Powell, Chief scout, is personally supervising the work and caraps of the boys scouts in this area.    By the end of thismonth
month.tho whole of tho namps accommodating over 10,000 workers will be occupied.    Representatives of the ^staffs of all Flax Centres assembled.last week in the Somerset area for the purpose of, instruction in the various operations of the harvest.    They also visited the factory at Preston, Yeovil, and studied the processes of manufacture from the straw to the finished article. ,ihree hundred gang leaders from Scotland have been sent to t Somerset for instructions in harvest operations.      With regard jjo &apos; the buildings, work is now being concentrated mainly upon tho do-seeding stations, in order that they may be reacfyto handle the crop immediately after the harvest is Completed.    With the exception of three de-seeding stations all the arrangements and plans in connection with the conversion of existing buildings are now completed, the plane are in possession of the Board of Works, and the necessary additions are in progress.    With regar^ to the new buildings the de-seeding portions of the new factories to be erected at Bunford (Yeovil) and at Peterborough have been decided upon and plans have been prepared and approved.    The Office of Works are proceeding with the work immediately and estimate the time for completion at 10 weeks.    The crops are generally looking extremely well in all the areas and a good yield is expeoted.    In Fifeshire the orop will be ready for harvesting nearly a fortnight earlier than had been anticipated, but will be light owing to the protracted drought.Tithe. Copyhold, Commons and Survey Branch.Among the applications received during the past week have been one for Altered Apportionment, six for redemption and seven for the merger 6f tithe rentcharge, and one for the enfranchisement of copyhold land, while three Altered Apportionments five redemptions, one merger and four enfranchisements have been completed.    One of the merger applications affects an impropriate tithe rentcharge of  239. 5. 9. charged on 6,954 acres of land, comprised in Lord Ashburnham&apos;s Pembrey Estate, Carmarthenshire, part of whieh has been purchased by the Board , for a farm colony.Joint Committee of i the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries , and the&apos;Ministry of Food. &apos;    -The proximity of the hay and corn harvests has reduced the number of queries sent in during the past week, and the time thus gained is being utilised in extending and continuing the scheme of organisation adopted by the Joint Committee in order to perfect the machinery requisite for an efficient winter campaign.    Of the enquiries received, two points of interest seem to hold the attention of the farming community, the question of labour and the question of a supply of concentrated feeding stuffs for milking cows.    In certain milk producing areas, dependent normally on outside sources of supply of feeding stuffs for the maintenance of an adequate milk        yield, an early release of cake and meal seems to be desirable if the output of milk is to be maintained.    The labour difficulties caused through the recent call of men to the Army, are further complicated by the fact that the exact scope of the powers and objects of the District Wages Boards as to the fixing of wages seems to be generally misunderstood by farmers and men alike.Ordnance Survey.During the week 47,931 maps were sent Overseas, 13,343 to the Admiralty, 5,035 to the Air Ministry, 3,074 to the War Office and 4,435 to ether Services.

In addition 21,000 copies of Leaflets wore despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.Fisheries Division.Administrative Section.At the&quot;- request of the Hydrographical Department ofthe Admiralty 5 ekman meters for measuring the drifts of ocean current have been obtained by the Board from Denmark.    A supply of wire rope has been obtained by the Board for the use of a Danish Atlantic Scientific fishery expedition.    The Department has also been actively engaged in obtaining supplies for Russian fisheries on the Hurraan Coast and supplies of cutch for the British netting industry.. A Conference with the Ministry of Reconstruction and with manufacturers of fishing nets has been held with a view to securing supplies for pressing work and after demobilization.     The Department has been consulted by the Trade Commissioner, for the Union of South Africa, with regard to processes for curing and smoking of fish;   and by the Fisheries Administration of Cairo with regard to labels for marking fish, An Order under the Board&apos;s new powers has been made authorising the use of seine nets and motor trawlers in certain areas on the North East Coast.     The approximate value of fish purchased, up to date, for the Italian Government through the agency of this Department is  930,773, 9. 11.Fishermen1s Registration and Recruiting Section.Proposals have been made by the Section with the support of the bulk of the inspectorate for enquiries to be held at each port by officers of the Board,    and nominees of the Admiralty jointly, wjfch a view of summarising the fishing position of the port, and giving each man an opportunity of stating in full any reasons he may have for wishing deferment of Naval Service.    The first nominal roil of men in trades ancillary to the fisheries, whose protection is desired by the Board, has gone out to the Inspectorate for discussion.    In one instance the list has been returned and despatched to the Regional Headquarters of the Ministry of National Service.Freshwater Fish Section,The principal work th&apos;3 Committee is at present confined to organising the eel fishery at the various spots selected by it for development.

Several new private trap installations are being dealt with and others are under consideration.Permit Section. 42 Permits were issued during the week and 10 were cancelled.
