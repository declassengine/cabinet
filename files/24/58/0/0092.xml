L..ance/2255,i is Doc dim aWAR   CA3IJCT.HOSTILE AIR FA IDS PIT HOSPITALS AT STAPLES ON THIS NIGHTS 19th - 20th LARCH and 31st FAY - 1st JUNE,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for V/ar.272vtn)aocordance with War Cabinet 417 (10), I circulate a summary &quot;of the reports received.22nd July, 1918.KILMER*Two separate accounts have been received of the hostile raids on the hospitals at ETAPLES on the nights 19th - 20th March and 31st May - 1st June,(a) The first account was prepared by Lieut,General Asser, GiOiC, L* of C Area,   To this account is attached a covering letter recording the opinion of G.H.Q,. as to whether the attacks on the hospitals were intentional or otherwise.(b) The second account deals chiefly with the evidence of the 3 German airmen who were captured during the first raid; but this account also contains evidence regarding the second raid on the night 31st May - 1st June.   This account, which records no evidence as to whether these raids were intentional or otherwise,, is signed by General Fowke, Adjutant General of the British Armies in France.The opinion recorded in the first account is as follows:-(a) There is no evidence to show that the first raid was directed primarily against the hospitals, and(b) That the second raid was carried out with no other object than that of deliberate destruction of one or more hospitalsIn the first account there is no mention as to whether the expert opinion of the G.O.C., Royal Air Force, in France, was consulted before arriving at the conclusions that the raids were deliberate or otherwise.   In the second account, however, there are two letters from General Salmond, Commanding Royal Air Force, expressing the following opinions(a) The first raid.   The evidence does not disclose any intention of bombing hospitals.   The bridge at STAPLES is a military objective of first importance and one of the most likely approaches to it would be from the North almost directly over the hospitals.   Further, the fact that the hospitals were not apparently marked prior to the raid, and that they are situated in the middle of Training and Rest Camps, which^are legitimate bombing targets, would make iW^mpossible to prove intentional, even if it did exist.   General Salmond goe3 on to say that however much pilots may try to avoid so doing, owing to the conditions under which bombs are dropped from aeroplanes, it is impossible to ensure accuracy within a wide margin except from very low altitudes indeed(b) Second - on being asked by the Adjutant-General as to whether he wished to modify his opinions after the second raid had taken place, and in view of the fact that special measures had been taken such as re-painting the red and white crosses marking the hospitals, General Salmond stated that while he could, not say for certain whether such crosses would be visible in the lightof
of the magnesium flare, it was extremely improbable that they would be distinctly visible at the height from which hostile pilots dropped&apos;their bombs, usually 5,000 feet or -over.&apos; On the evidence -as it stands he saw no reason to modify his former   opinion.Sir Douglas, Kaig&apos;s reasons for forming the opinion that the second raid was deliberate are set forth in paragraph 3 of his report.   &quot;Subsequent to the raid on the. 19th - 20th March; special measures were taken for protecting hospitals and red crosses were re-painted so that there could be no possible doubt as to the hospital area.     These crosses are clearly shown on the attached photograph&quot;.   This opinion is therefore contrary to . General Salmond&apos;s opinion.From the above evidence it does not seem possible to arrive at any definite conclusion in the matter.As a matter of policy, where we have so many, cases of calculated brutality as to which there is no possible doubt, such as the destruction of hospital ships, I think it is a pity to attempt to make capital out of a doubtful case.
