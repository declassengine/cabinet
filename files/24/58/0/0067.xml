Major-General Sir G. Aston, K.C.B., of the War Cabinet Secretariat. And Private Secretaries.Imperial Meat Supplies.Mr. MASSEY : Before we go on with to-day&apos;s business, Mr. Long, I want to say that last time we discussed the meat question it was said that another opportunity would be given. I do. not know in what form it will come up, but there is some information I would like to obtain and, if it is in order, I will hand a memorandum to you. &quot;What is wanted is the quantity, the net price, and the landed cost in England of meat imported into the United Kingdom from the United States since the commencement of the present year.CHAIEMAN : That information we will get from the Eood Controller.Mr. MASSEY: I have got to explain the position to my own country, and I should like to know as quickly as possible.Sir JOSEPH WARD: Will it be possible to get a balance sheet of Swiffs for last year ?CHAIEMAN : I have not the least idea.Sir JOSEPH WAED: It would be a very useful thing to have.Mr. COOK: Including the honourable understandings.CHAIEMAN: The Conference could not ask for a thing of that sort.Sir JOSEPH WAED: I thought the Board of Trade would perhaps have it.CHAIEMAN : I do not know : I will ask.Royal Arms.Mr. MASSEY: I want to give notice of a motion I have been asked to lay before the Conference by people who are interesting themselves in the proposal, and I am personally interested in it too. &quot;This Conference supports the proposal that the &quot; Eoyal Arms should be altered so as to include some appropriate representation of &quot; Overseas Dominions and Dependencies and India thereon.&quot; There is a petition being circulated.   It is the easiest thing to alter it.Channels of Communication.Mr. HUGHES: If I may be permitted. I will now address myself to the Eesolution which I propose to move on the subject of channels of communication, and I will do so very shortly. The principle was established before the War that the Imperial Conference is a conference of Governments, of which the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is ex-oflicio President, as primus inter pares, and the Dominion Prime Ministers represent their respective States. It is no longer as it used to be, a Departmental affair of the Colonial Office. But in the intervals between the Conferences, when the Dominion Prime Ministers had returned to their several homes, communications reverted to their traditional channels, through the medium of the Colonial Office, the only recognised medium for the exchange of correspondence between the British Government and the Dominion Governments. Now, to meet the stress and necessities of war, there has emerged the great fact of the Imperial War Cabinet. The Dominions, no longer infant settlements, but grown sister-nations, are taking their full share and their, full responsibility in the waging of. the war; the Prime Minister of the Mother-country is sitting in Council withi the Dominion Prime Ministers, together with, the British and Dominion Ministers, first among his peers.
IS July 1918.] Channels of. Communication. [\Wi Day.Mr. HUGHES-^. .*In the Imperial &quot;War Cabinet, all circumlocutions, all intermediaries have been swept away, and Government meets Government face to face. It is obvious that these outstanding facts represent a growth, a development of the Imperial relation, to which the old formulas of administration and the old methods of correspondence are no longer applicable, and that new formulas and new methods must be developed to bring the machinery of government into harmony with the realities. It is true that something has been done in this direction. At the Imperial Conference in 1907 the question of direct communication was raised by Mr. Dealdn, who suggested (see Proceedings, page 28),* that the business of the self-governing Colonies should be detached from the Colonial Office and transferred to the Prime Minister. It was again raised at the Conference of 1911 by General Botha (see Proceedings, pages 75 and 91).t His proposal was &quot; That it is desirable that all matters relating to self-&quot; governing Dominions as well as permanent secretariat of the Imperial Conference, &quot; be placed directly under the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.&quot; Both times the British Cabinet rejected the suggestion, on the ground that it would overburden the Prime Minister, but the creation, since then, of the Imperial Cabinet is a new factor. The burden which the Prime Minister could not bear he is to bear while the War Cabinet is sitting. The machinery has had to be adapted to meet the new situation, and there appears to be no reason why it should not be made continuous, whether the War Cabinet is, or is not, sitting for the time being. The division of the Colonial Office into Dominion and Crown Colony Branches is good, as far as it goes. But the change must go deeper. Organic recognition must be given to the fact that  apart from Imperial Conferences Imperial relations have reached a stage at which, in the course of daily administration, the Dominion Governments are conferring, negotiating and transacting business with the Imperial Government, not inter-departraentally, but inter-governmentally. Just as, in the War Cabinet, each Dominion Government, represented by its Prime Minister, confers with the British Government represented by its Prime Minister, so in the course of adminis-tration the head of a Dominion Government should be able to confer directly with the head of: the British Government. The fact must be faced that as regards the Dominions, the present method of administration through the Colonial Office, even with the distinction now drawn between the Dominions and Crown Colonies, has, by the unanswerable logic of events, become an anachronism. Let us look at the facts, and at the forms. As a fact the Governor-General of Australia is the King&apos;s Representative in the Commonwealth, and he acts with the advice of his responsible Ministers in Australia, the responsible Ministers of a self-governing Dominion of the Empire. But in form the Governor-General is still an officer of the Colonial Office, a civil servant of the highest class, but still a civil servant, who is responsible to, and reports to, the head of his department. The Prime Minister of a Dominion desiring to communicate with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, writes to the Governor-General. The Governor-General writes to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Secretary of State for the Colonies writes to the Prime Minister. And the Prime Minister replies through the same tortuous channel. This mode of communication is too indirect for the proper conduct of modern business, and it has to be remembered that government now-a-days is largely a matter of business, which permits neither of indirection nor of delay. I am not committed to detail, I am dealing with the great principle, and it is a great principle. In this, we formally recognise the great basis fact that the Dominions are no longer Colonies in the old sense, but self-governing nations, and the existing forms of government should be adapted and brought up to date to fit the facts as we now see them. The present system is archaic. In effect, we are a League of Pree Nations, every one of us, which has, notwithstanding theories of the thing, a sovereign, or a quasi-sovereign in our respective spheres, and our relations should be those which those circumstances suggest. I am going to move a R-esolution which, without committing us to the actual machinery, will carry this out. It has been suggested by me and I think puts the matter in a form of being settled, and that without delay. In the form in which I had given notice of the Besolution, Sir llobert Borclen and others have made some-  *. Gel. 3523.    - f Cel.&apos;5745.  .....A 2
Mr. HTJ&amp;HES-cont.alterations, or suggested some alterations, which do not impair the Resolution at all. I am very pleased to indicate what these amendments are, and to say that I shall accept them. The Resolution will read as follows: That this Conference is of the &quot; opinion that the development which has taken place in the relations between the &quot; United Kingdom and the Dominions has necessitated such a change in the adminis-&quot; trative arrangements and in the Channels of Communication between their &quot; Governments as will bring them more directly in touch with each other.&quot;Sir ROBERT BORDEN: I gave Mr. Long a copy of that.Mr. HUGHES: All right. In the second paragraph, Mr. Burton has suggested  and I see the force of it adding the word &quot; Imperial,&quot; so that the reference will be to the &quot; Imperial War Cabinet,&quot; and we now know to what body we are referring. Without more ado I move the Resolution in this form: &quot; (lj That this Conference &quot; is of the opinion that the development which has taken place in the relations &quot; between the United Kingdom and the Dominions necessitates such a change &quot; in administrative arrangements and channels of communication between their &quot; Governments as will bring them more directly in touch with each other. (2) That &quot; the Imperial War Cabinet be invited to give immediate consideration to the &quot; creation of suitable machinery for this purpose.&quot;Sir ROBERT BORDEN: Mr. Chairman, I am very glad to support the Resolution in its present form, and I think it embodies the idea which is present to the minds of all of us and in which I know you fully concur. It should be said, of course, that the presentation of this Resolution at the present time is not in any way connected with the tenure of this office by you. We all realise the great ability, the strong devotion to duty, and the broad vision which you have always brought to bear upon questions which are submitted to you from time to time in the important office which you hold.Mr. HUGHES : Hear, hear.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: All that goes without saying, and it is hardly necessary to mention it. At the Conference last year a question was raised as to the relations between the Mother-country and the Self-governing Dominions of the Empire, and India as well--a very important portion of the Empire. It was felt at that time that so great a subject ought not to be taken up in the midst of a war, and, accordingly, this Resolution Avas passed : &quot; The Imperial War Conference are of &quot; opinion that the readjustment of the constitutional relations of the component &quot; parts of the Empire is too important and intricate a subject to be dealt with during &quot; the war, and that it should form the subject of a special Imperial Conference, to &quot; be summoned as soon as possible after the cessation of hostilities. They deem it &quot; their duty, however, to place on record their view that any such readjustment, &quot; while thoroughly preserving all existing powers of self-government and complete &quot; control of domestic affairs, should be based upon a full recognition of the Dominions &quot; as autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth, and of India as an &quot; important portion of the same; should recognise the right of the Dominions and &quot; India to an adequate voice in foreign policy and in foreign relations, and should &quot; provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters &quot; of common Imperial concern, and for such necessary concerted action, founded on &quot; consultation, as the several Governments may determine.It does not appear to mo that the Resolution in the terms proposed by Mr. Hughes departs from the principle which we recognised at that time: it merely provides for a&apos; more effective and more appropriate method of communication between the Governments of the Dominions, and of India as well, no doubt, and the Government of the United Kingdom. The initiation of the Imperial War, Cabinet by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in December 1916, Avas a very important development indeed, and it seems to me that the proposal Avhich Mr. Hughes has brought fohvard is quite inevitable from the very fact that that course has been adopted. I have ventured to say, both in Canada and here, that the Imperial War Cabinet is really a cabinet of Governments.  Any executive action, for the most part, must be carried out by the* See pp. 40-61 of Cd. 8566.
Sir ROBERT BORDEN-cont.different Governments of the Empire, and must he sanctioned by the Parliaments of the Empire. But, nevertheless, it is a Cabinet in the true sense of the word, and its creation corresponds to that increasing consciousness of nationhood which is growing up, certainly in Canada, and I believe is equally strong in all the Dominions of the Empire. So far as the status of the Governor-General is concerned, while he is an Imperial officer, i venture the assertion that in Canada he regards his relation to the Government in Canada as of precisely the same character as the relation of the King to the Government of the United Kingdom. That has been my experience during the past seven years in which I have held the office of Prime Minister in Canada.Mr. COOK : That has been ours, too.Mr. MASSEY: It is the proper position.Mr. HUGHES: Yes.Sir ROBERT BORDEN : I am not quite clear as to whether or not the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom can undertake the discharge of the duties which Mr. Hughes has suggested. Of course, Mr. Hughes will be the first to agree with me that it would he most undesirable to have the Prime Minister undertake duties which lie could only nominally discharge. If he is to be connected with the Oversea Dominions in this way, it must be a real connection, and not a mere nominal con-nection. And it was for that reason I suggested to Mr. Hughes and our colleagues generally that the subject, so far as the details are concerned, might very well be taken up and thrashed out in the Imperial War Cabinet. We should have to get his own views, because we could not ask him to undertake burdens which lie could not fairly and reasonably and efficiently discharge. With those observations, I am heartily in support of the Resolution which Mr. Hughes has moved, and I shall he very glad to second his motion.CHAIRMAN: Perhaps I had better read it as altered. This Resolution has been moved by the Prime Minister of Australia, and seconded by the Prime Minister of Canada : &quot; (1) That this Conference is of the opinion that the development which &quot; has taken place in the relations between the United Kingdom and the Dominions &quot; necessitates such a change in administrative arrangements and channels of com-&quot; munication between their Governments as will bring them more directly in touch &quot; with each other. (2) That the Imperial War Cabinet be invited to give immediate consideration to the creation of suitable machinery for this purpose.&quot;Mr. MASSEY: i should have been very pleased, Mr. Long, if the motion could have been rendered more definite, because i am not quite clear what is intended now, except this: that I understand this Resolution refers the whole question to the Imperial War Cabinet. Is it intended to bring it before the War Cabinet during the next few weeks, while the representatives of the Oversea Dominions are here ?Mr. HUGHES : Yes, it must be done while we are here.Mr. MASSEY : Well, i want a definite statement on that point, because, if it is going to be referred at all, it would not be of very much use referring it to them after we had gone.Mr. HUGHES: No.Mr. MASSEY: I am glad to hear, from both speakers, that no reflection is intended on the Colonial Office as at present constituted. My experience of the Colonial Office during the time I have been Prime Minister and I am now in my seventh year-is that they have done their work well, and thoroughly, and enthusiastically, and I have always, personally, met with the greatest courtesy from the Colonial Office, from each and every one of the staff, from Mr. Long downwards&apos;. I do not wish to go into particulars now -J-Mr. HUGHES : I cordially agree with that.Mr. MASSEY: This Resolution of Mr. Hughes contemplates continuing the War Cabinet even when the war has come to an end-under another name, of course, for it will then be the Imperial Cabinet. I do not know whether we can have any definite statement as to what is intended: I do not recollect any on the question. I am certain the Dominions will never be satisfied to go back to the system whichA 3
12th Day.] Channels or Communication. [18 July 1918.Mr. MASSEY-6m/. . ;    .......... /;obtained before the war, in which they had positively no say in Imperial affairs. They will never go back to that system. Nor do I suggest, for one moment, that the British Government desires anything of the kind. My experience is that the citizens of Britain and the members of the British Government are just as anxious to give thorough and. proper representation in connection with Imperial affairs as we are. That is my opinion, and I think it is correct. What I think will be the real solution of the difficulty, and what I think must come in future years, will be a representation of the Dominions at the heart of the Empire by, in each case, a resident Minister. The Dominions will not be satisfied, I feel certain, with their representatives coming along here for a month or six weeks once a year. I do not think they will be satisfied with that. I think they will expect the setting up of a Cabinet which will meet regularly in the heart of the Empire. It may meet monthly, or weekly, or whenever it is required. But I think the members of the Cabinet should be here so that they may be called upon at any time when it is necessary for the Prime Minister to confer with them, or for the whole Cabinet to consider anything of importance to the Empire as a whole. I believe that is what is coming. And even then it will be capable of development. It will develop as time goes on, and the populations of the Oversea Dominions increase, as undoubtedly they will. One cannot think of what the possibilities really are : it is almost impossible to suggest them, they are so immense, and I shall not attempt it. That is my own opinion. I believe the real solution is, a resident Minister in each case. It may come sooner, or it may come later. I am not thinking of New Zealand by itself, I am thinking of the Dominions as a whole, more particularly of the larger Dominions, such as Canada and Australia. I have no doubt that, when the time comes, New Zealand will follow suit. It has been said, and it is a statement with which we must all agree, that we are self-governing nations, but we are self-governing nations within the Empire, under one Sovereign. And that is really the object of the proposal-to keep us as as we are, to prevent the possibility of our drifting apart, or of the painter being cut over, perhaps, some comparatively small matter. We have known such things in the past, and they should be avoided in the future. And one of the best methods to keep the Empire together is to give its self-governing Dominions at the heart of the Empire sufficient representation on the Council-whatever it may be called, Cabinet, or Council, or any other name which may be given to it that they shall have adequate representation. I do not think there will then be the slightest danger of the nations of the Empire drifting apart, and of the Empire coming to grief, as history has shown us that Empires in the past have done. I think the motive of the Resolution is a good one, and T shall look forward, with a great deal of interest, to its coming before the Imperial War Cabinet.Mr. BURTON : Mr. Long, I am in favour of this Resolution, and as far as we are concerned in South Africa it is hardly necessary for me to say that the Resolution is not prompted by any sense of dissatisfaction or of complaint against the adminis-tration of the Colonial Office, whether under your authority, Sir, or indeed that of any of your predecessors. The days have iong gone by when any such complaint could justly be made. The Resolution really seems to me to be only one arising as a consequence of more recent developments, especially during the war, in the relation-ship between the Mother Country and the Dominions. These developments, which we are all aware of, and which I need not specify now in detail, have been undoubtedly of the most important and interesting character. I suppose future historians will point to this period as being, in respect of the growth of the British Empire, one of the most vital periods of our Imperial development. What has been achieved now is recognition of equality of status as between the various States which form the British Commonwealth. Equality of status, we all know perfectly well, does not involve any claim on our part to equality in respect of population, of wealth, or of power. Well, I do not think the time has arrived now when any useful purpose can be served by discussing the details which would be involved in carrying out the spirit of the Resolution. That can only be done, to my mind, by referring the question, as is done in the second part ,of the Resolution, to the Imperial War Cabinet. But I entirely agree with the view taken that incidentally the effect which the changes which are foreshadowed here will have upon the position and the status of the Governor-General of any of the Dominions is an important one, and I think the change will be one. in
18 July 1918.] Channels or Communication. [I2lh Day.Mr. BURTON-caw/.the right direction. The net effect of it, in a word, will be that the Governor-General will become really what he should be in the Dominions, namely, the Viceroy. He will represent the Crown in the Dominions, as the King represents the Crown in the Mother-country. He will represent the King, and not be, as he has largely been hitherto, an official, even though an exalted official, of one of the Government Depart-ments. No doubt, as has been pointed out, there would be great difficulties in detail in carrying it out, and these would have to he discussed and dealt with; but on broad general grounds, I think, Sir, you will agree with us that this Resolution embodies only the natural sequence of events, the logical and natural outcome of the changes which are taking place now, and which are of this most highly interesting character in the growth of the British Empire.   I support the Resolution.Sir S. P. SINHA: Mr. Long, perhaps this Resolution primd facie does not affect India at the present moment, because I recognise that the position of the Secretary of State for India is in many&apos; essential respects different from that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. But we have still the fact that the recent developments include the inclusion of India by a separate representative in the Imperial Cabinet. I was glad to have Sir Robert Borden&apos;s assurance that the Resolution now proposed is in no way intended to be inconsistent with the one we passed last year; and all I want to say at this stage is this-that in developing the administrative arrangements and channels of communication that are referred to in the Resolution we should not lose sight of the peculiar position of India as it exists now in reference to the Imperial War Cabinet, and that, in making these arrange-ments, some modification should be made of the relations now existing between the Government of India and the Government in this country.(Mr. Lloyd here took his seat at ihe Conference^)CHAIRMAN: Mr. Lloyd, would you like to say anything on this Resolution &apos;? Mr. LLOYD : Is there anyone else to speak P   Is the discussion closing ? CHAIRMAN: All the other Prime Ministers have spoken.Mr. ROWELL : I will say a word or two until Dr. Lloyd gets a grip of it and my only reason for doing so is the very great importance of the Resolution now under the consideration of the Conference. Its importance, as has been so fittingly said, lies in the recognition of the equal status of the Dominions with that of the Mother-country. Undoubtedly with us in Canada, and I presume it is true of the other Dominions, there has been a great growth of national sentiment and national spirit during the war. That national sentiment and national spirit, however, is not incom-patible with the idea of the unity of the maintenance of the unity of the Empire. The proposal now under consideration, if given effect to, will be a recognition of that national spirit, and I believe will be accepted as such and appreciated as such, and every recognition which we can give of the national spirit of the Dominions, consistent with maintaining the unity of the Commonwealth as a whole, will, I believe, prove a step in the right direction, will give satisfaction to the Dominions, and in the long run will strengthen the ties which bind the Empire together. This war has shown that the largest liberty is compatible with the greatest, unity in action and in purpose, and I believe the change, when brought about, will have that result. As Sir Robert Borden and Mr. Burton have so well said, it is the logical result of the events of the past few years, and it is probably another step in the natural and logical development of an Imperial constitution which under our very elastic system may be modified from time to time to meet the exigencies of the situation as that situation develops.Mr. LLOYD: Mr. Long, I may say I am in general agreement with the Resolution as now drafted. I was a little hesitant about the original Resolution, as I thought it might have a tendency to make a sub-department of the Prime Minister&apos;s Department, and probably the last state would have been worse than the first. But in the form which it now takes, that something should be done towards considering the general channels of communication, not Only between the Dominions and&apos; the Homeland, but, I take it, between one Dominion and the other, I think it will give some formal shape to the recognition of what Newfoundland Has, even though-it is so small that is, a national sentiment.   1 &quot; &apos; ,/&apos;- &apos;&quot; K 1 /a 4
YMh Day,] Channels of Communication. [18 July 1918.Sir ROBERT BORDEN : Hear, hear.Mr. LLOYD: And so strong is it that we have never been able to convince ourselves that we should even get into a great Dominion. Small as we are, wre still have a national sentiment, and not less so that we respect the great Dominions ; but still we feel that we want to keep in actual, close, and direct contact with the great Mother-country. I do not think I can usefully add anything more. I think this is a step in the right direction.CHAIRMAN : Does any other member of the Conference wish to add anything ?Mr. COOK : I should like to say that I concur absolutely in the proposals which have been submitted to the Conference. It is an incident in the evolution which is constantly going on, in a large and wide view, in our relations and responsibilities. Everybody is agreed that something of this kind is inevitable, and the chief feature of the Resolution is that it proposes a practical step for the solution of the whole question.I should imagine the Prime Minister will find that he is very overburdened at present, and certainly not able to take upon his shoulders all that now devolves upon the shoulders of the Colonial Secretary. What I think will have to be done is that you will have to set yourselves to a definition of the cases about which there shall be consultation and direct communication between the Prime Ministers of the States and the Prime Minister here. Otherwise, you will be making the Prime Minister just that same conduit-pipe which we find in the Colonial Office. A huge section of our correspondence overseas has no specific relation to the Prime Minister o.r his Department, and it &quot;seems to me that as regards such matters the channels might very well remain where they are. But there is no doubt that larger, higher, and more important class of questions as to which there should be the closest possible and the most direct possible inter-relation between the Prime Minister of Britain and the Prime Ministers of the outlying Dominions. There I think will be your task in defining what that class of cases is, and so relieving the Prime Minister here of all the detail inter-Departmental work which is now performed, and on the whole performed well, by the Colonial Office.I should only like to say, with regard to one or two naval matters lately, that after the Naval Board of Australia trying the Navy direct here and getting no result or satisfaction, I got the Prime Minister to send these matters through the Colonial Office, and we had very prompt despatch. And therefore I think that that machinery, though perhaps it could be burnished up a little, would still be necessary for dealing with the detailed administration of the other Dominions, while reserving for the Prime Minister that other class of correspondence on cases which have to do with the policy of the Empire generally. I concur absolutely with the proposition, Mr. Long.Sir JOSEPH WARD: Mr. Long, in listening to the discussion to-day, I am very much struck with the tremendous change which has taken place during the last 11 years. In 1907, when a proposal of this kind w.as up, not quite of the same nature, it did not meet with very much support, although an adjustment was made for the purpose of carrying on the work between the Colonial Office and oversea countries which proved to be very effective, and indeed in many respects a tremendous improvement upon the old system.I want to add my word of recognition to the good work which the Colonial Office throughout, so far as my experience is concerned, has done. That not only applies to the present Secretary of State for the Colonies, but to his predecessors. I think from the point of view of the work of the Colonial Office none of the oversea countries have had any reason for complaint at all; on the contrary, I think they have had a great deal to be satisfied with.In 1911, again, proposals in a similar direction to these were met with practically nothing but opposition, and it all goes to show that what we are doing now is, in my opinion, tentative. I do not believe there is anybody sitting at this table who thinks of the situation in its prospective development who believes for one moment that the present transference of some of the work connected with- the oversea countries to a War Cabinet is going to meet the aspirations and the necessities of the oversea countries in the. years to come.  I for one, do not believe it.  On the contrary, I
18 July 1918.] Channels of Communication. [12M Day.Sir JOSEPH WAlW-cont.believe it is a step forward which is acceptable,- but it is not going to stop there. We have all to learn yet, in the years that are coming very close to us, what the British Government and British people are going to do in connection with their own governmental affairs. I have no hesitation in saying as a public man, without putting my own oar into the boat in connection with the Imperial Government&apos; at all, that the condition of things which exists here can no more go on as at present than we can go on under the system which existed before we came here last year. There are great changes impending through necessity, and those changes, which are perhaps at the moment only in the air, are going to have a material effect upon the construction and upon the system that the Homeland is going to apply to the oversea countries. I think, as one of the representatives from New Zealand, I would be absolutely misleading myself and misleading the people I have the honour to represent if I were to run away with the idea that this system of a War Cabinet is satisfactory. I think it is not. I do not believe it is satisfactory to the people of the oversea countries that representatives who are entitled to go to the War Cabinet, should merely come here after the lapse of 10 months and go to the War Cabinet for six or eight weeks. They are treated with great courtesy and consideration, and are put upon an equality with the statesmen here, which is a fine recognition of what the people in the outstanding parts of the Empire are entitled to, and in that respect it is deserving o&quot;f the very greatest recognition by us as public men. But it is no good to run away with the idea that coming here for six or ten weeks out of the 12 mcnths is giving the people in the oversea countries the position that they ought to have in respect of Imperial matters concerning themselves. It would be mis-leading to our people to tell them that that is the case. You come here after a lapse of 10 months, and it is a question of tilings having been done in the 10 months, and you cannot undo them, and it is useless to run away with the idea that we are taking an active part in the shaping of our destinies in a War Cabinet when we are away from it for 10 months.   The thing answers itself.Mr. HUGHES : This does not profess to cure that disease.Sir ROBERT BORDEN: It is not dealing with that question.Sir JOSEPH WARD: No, but I am quite entitled to refer to it in discussing it, and for a moment or two I propose to do so. Now, it is quite clear to me that, whatever the effect of this is going to be, no Prime Minister who has ever lived, or is living at the present moment, can undertake these duties satisfactorily. It is an impossibility. I agree that the voice of the&apos; Governments in the overseas countries should go direct to the Prime Minister. That, I think, at this juncture, due to war developments generally, is a necessity, and I think the motion is in the right direction. I am not opposing the motion very far from it; but there is no one can make me believe that the Prime Minister of England, with the multitudinous and overriding duties connected with his office, can, from a practical standpoint, undertake the work which the Colonial Office has been doing for years past, on account of the tremendous ramifications from this centre right over the oversea countries. I think it is humanly impossible for any man to be able to undertake those duties, and it is no disrespect to the present holder of the office, who is a gifted man, to say that he will not be able, any more than any other man, to carry out work of that kind. It presupposes-and it is far better to say so -that, if effect is to be given to this Resolution, it should be emphasised that there should be a special Minister detailed to do that work. And when you cc-me to a special Minister, who is to be the special Minister ? My answer is the Secretary of State for the Colonies. If you are to have a special Minister to deal with work which we are all familiar with from our point of view, then who is the man in the British Government most likely to be that special Minister, even though it does not percolate from his office and circulate from his office ? We are blinding ourselves to the real position if we suggest that the Prime Minister can deal with these matters. I say he cannot. It is for the Prime Minister himself to say, when it comes before the War Cabinet, whether he thinks he can do it or not, but I have no hesitation in saying that it is n)t feasible in my opinion.U  5962-Pro 12 - B
12ch Day.] Channels op Communication. [18 July 1918.Sir JOSEPH WKKQ-cont.I shall not take up the time of the Conference further than to say this that in my opinion we are only at the beginning of what requires to be done for the British Empire. Those young nations out there have got their own ideas of the developments which have taken place, in the last few years particularly, and those people, who are going in the future to take their share in the cost of Naval protection, and who are taking upon themselves and properly and rightly so-the cost of the Armies &apos; which have been sent over for the purpose of preserving the British Empire those people, who know we are going to live in a new world from the point of view of trade protection and consolidation, and from the point of view of Empire protection, know that they have got in the future to pay a considerable sum of money every year, apart from local matters, which does not require defence from the autonomous point of view, which is their preserve and their preserve only, and they will allow no one else to interfere with it-those people know that in the future they will have to provide probably millions a year, and they are never going to be content to do that without practical representation of the people themselves, and they are never going to do it without their public men being in a position to discuss matters publicly, in the light of day, and in the Press, giving the people generally throughout the country the knowledge of what is being done. They are never going to be parties, in the years that are to come, to taking up their share of the responsibilities which they are prepared to do under a system which gives them no publicity whatever, and under which they are bound--Mr. HUGHES: This will involve them in no responsibility whatever which does not fall upon them now.   I would not vote for it if it did.Sir JOSEPH WARD: You cannot tell what may happen. I think your Resolution is right, and I am not opposing it. But I am pointing out the fact that it is not going to stop there.Mr. COOK : We shall not stop for about 500 years.Sfr JOSEPH WARD: I hope not.Mr. MASSEY: Perhaps not then.Sir JOSEPH WARD: Progress is a very necessary thing. Now, I will give a typical case of what is in my mind. At the Conference last year I proposed a Resolution asking that we should have the advice of the Navy as to what they believed to be the best system for a Navy for the British Empire.Mr. COOK: It is settled long ago.Sir JOSEPH WARD: It is not settled, pardon me. You may imagine-Australia, I mean that it is, from your point of view; but we are in this position, and I want to call attention to it. This Conference passed a Resolution to get a report for the guidance of the oversea countries, and for the guidance of the people there. And what has happened ? There is a report marked &quot; Confidential,&quot; which has not come to this Conference at all; it has gone to the War Cabinet, and we are in the position, as public men, on a matter of great consequence to those whom we represent, of keeping our mouths shut.CHAIRMAN: What report is that ? I think that report to which you refer has been circulated to the Conference. I am not aware of any report which has not been circulated.Sir JOSEPH WARD: I have not seen it.CHAIRMAN: It has been circulated. In the mass of papers you may have overlooked it.Sir JOSEPH WARD: I may be in the position personally of having overlooked it. I know it has gone to the War Cabinet, because 1 have seen it there. However, I am calling attention to this as one aspect of the development of the Empire as a whole. There is a matter of the greatest importance arid consequence to the Empire as a whole, and it is marked &quot; Confidential,&quot; and no one can make any use of it.Mr. MASSEY: We cannot discuss that in war time.
18 July 1918.] Channels of Communication. [12th Day.Mr. HUGHES: What has this to do with this Resolution ?Sir JOSEPH WARD: Pardon me, Mr. Hughes. I never interrupt you when you are speaking.Mr. HUGHES : I have opinions upon this particular thing.Sir JOSEPH WARD: You have your views and I have mine. We are dis-cussing a certain matter, 1 have opinions upon that matter, and I am entitled to express them, and I do not think it is quite fair for you to suggest how I should state my views.   I am entitled to put them in my own way.Mr. HUGHES: I do not know what particular document you are alluding to.Sir JOSEPH WARD : I am alluding to the Report of the First Sea Lord.Mr. COOK: Which, was circulated to the War Cabinet.Sir JOSEPH WARD: It is a report on a matter of very great importance to the whole British Empire. That is a document which, in my opinion, should go among the records of the Imperial Conference, and as soon as we are in a position to do so the word &quot; Confidential&quot; should be removed from it, in the interests of public men in all parts of the British Empire.Mr. COOK: I understand we are to discuss that on Monday or Tuesday, and we are bound to get it.Sir JOSEPH WARD: Yes, Mr. Cook, but pardon me; I think you will find, and I think it is right, in the meantime -I agree with Mr. Massey there that in war time you cannot discuss any matters that might be of use to the enemy, and I do not suggest that we should do that. But when this war is over, and we are upon the basis of helping to make the Empire stronger, and to alter the machinery so as to give it more effective representation, surely it is desirable that in any matter which affects the whole Empire we should not be barred by &quot;Confidential&quot; remaining upon a paper after the Conference is over and after the war has ceased ? That is the point I make.I do not propose to take up the time of the Conference further than to say that the natural evolution which is going on is bringing right up the necessity for changes. I think Mr. Hughes&apos;s motion is in the right direction, and I want to make it clear that in giving it support, like other gentlemen who have spoken, that does not, directly or indirectly, imply that there is any want of confidence on my part in the Colonial Office, or any want of satisfaction with the work it has done in the years which are past.CHAIRMAN: Before this Resolution is adopted by the Conference, I hope the Conference will allow me to say, very briefly, a word or two on behalf of the Depart-ment over which I have the honour to preside for the time being. Of course this motion is really one for the head of the Government, and not any other member of the Government, to express a definite opinion upon, and therefore all I can say will be connected with my branch of the case as Secretary of State for the Colonies for the moment,First, I should like to say how gratefully I acknowledge the references which have been made to this Department. I am very much obliged for the personal references to myself, but I attach much greater value to the references to the Depart-ment, because I can speak, perhaps with more definite knowledge than anybody else, of the immense labour and trouble that every member of this Department takes to act in conformity with the obvious wishes of the great Dominions, and not only that, but to co-operate with the representatives of the Dominions in strengthening the foundations upon which the Empire as a whole stands. And, therefore, I know it will be a matter of gratification to them to feel that their labours have not been in vain. - - ,As regards this question of what I may call the consequential changes in the form and machinery of Government, the Colonial Office is in entire accord with the views held by the members of the Conference and I think held very generally &apos; that it would be to act entirely in opposition to the spirit of the times, and to the quiet, steady, evolution of the Empire, if we were to think that machinery which was sufficient 10,15, or 20 years ago would be sufficient after the great change in the Empire which has taken place not only since the war but which was taking place
12th Day.] Channels of Communication. [18 July 1918.CHAIRMAN-^.before the war. And in proof of this I may say that we have had this matter under consideration for a very long time. It is full of difficulties. I should have been compelled to point out many difficulties, which do not occur in this Resolution, had it remained in its original form. I do not think it would be possible-and perhaps I may remind the Conference, very respectfully, that I have been a member of the Cabinet since 1895, and I have served under four Prime Ministers, and therefore I speak with some small experience-Mr. COOK : You were here when I first took it up.CHAIRMAN: It is a good many years ago, I am afraid. But I am satisfied that in peace time, quite as much as in war time, it would he impossible for the Prime Minister of this country to do the actual work of representation of the Dominions in the Government here at home. I am convinced of that. His work has been growing of late years immensely. Where he was called upon, when I first joined the Cabinet, to speak once or twice a week, he is now called upon to speak almost daily upon a whole variety of subjects, and he is supposed to have all the strings in his hand, and 10 be able to control and has to control the general administration. And to expect him to undertake the immense volume of work which still attaches to the Colonial Office in connection with the Dominions Avould, I am sure, be impossible.There is one other aspect of the case which I am sure Prime Ministers would wish me to refer to, and that is the Governors-General. Of course, any change of this kind must materially affect them, probably more than anybody else, and I am sure my colleagues here will agree that nothing definite ought to he said or done until we have been able to communicate with them and place the facts before them. I ventured to write to the Governors-General, in accordance with my usual practice  I write to them every week-1 wrote to them some little time ago telling them that I thought there was a desire for a change, and indicating, as far as I was able, .the sort of lines along which I thought those proposals would run, and also what my own views were. Of course, there has not been time to hear from them yet, but, no doubt, I shall have their views before long. I think myself that changes are necessary, and I have already told the Prime Minister indeed I have given him a statement making suggestions of my own and I shall he ready to discuss them whenever the question is raised in the Imperial War Cabinet, or to discuss them at any time with my colleagues on the Conference not in the Conference itself, but privately if they so wish. My sole desire is the same as theirs is that such changes as are necessary shall be made in a way which will tend to strengthen the foundations upon which the Empire as a whole rests.I hope the Conference will forgive me for making these few remarks, and, having made them, I will put the Resolution to the Conference, which, as I under-stand, is prepared to adopt it unanimously.The Resolution was then carried unanimously as follows : &quot; (1) That this Conference is of the opinion that the development which has taken place in the relations between the United Kingdom and the Dominions necessitates such a change in administrative arrangements and in the Channels of Communication between their Governments as will bring them more directly in touch with each other.&quot; (2) That the Imperial War Cabinet be invited to give immediate consideration to the creation of suitable machinery for this purpose.&quot;
