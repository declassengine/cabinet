^ few ^&quot;&quot;^ .....This Document is the Property of .n/DC Afl7^ His Britannic Ma!esty&apos;8 Government   .)DIS0N&apos;S HOTS ON THE 11A1T SITUATION.. -HeaoVandio..by the secretary of State   for   War. p   .   feTr- ....With the general principles underlying Dr. ACdison^s memorandum G.T.4971 there can he no disagreement; they are &quot;being applied daily in the Staff Duties directorate of the General staff anq; in the Adjutant General&apos;s Department both in the War Office and at General Headquarters, France.In judging, however, of the lessons to be drawn from the figures, on which he relies, the following considerations have     to be borne in mind;The figures given for the British and French Armies may be accepted as correct, but it is unsafe to assume that those for the German Amy attain a groat decree of accuracy,  since calculation as to the enemy strengths, while fairly reliable for fighting troops, must become more and more conjectural as it relates to the more rearward services and formations.     The main point, however, I is that, as a general proposition, it is incorrect to assume that the ration strength of a force^represents the whole of the man power h devoted to its maintenance in the country &quot;here it operates. &quot;  while  I the ration strength of the British armies in prance and Italy represents the whole body of man power devoted to its maintenance in those countries, in the German and French armies this is not the case: so that for a just comparison between the three armies a large amount of forced labour and civilian labour should be added to the French and German ration strengths.,    Every British individual, man or woman, employed in the service of the armies in France or Italy, is a portion of those armies and borne on the ration strength. All the military labour, white, coloured and alien, employed by the &quot; J British on the rearward defences has its counterpart on the French side in a large body of miners and other civilian labourers who are not borne on the French ration strength; while the Germans eraploy a great amount of forced civilian labour in occupied territories which! cannot, as a mere examination of Dr. Ao.cison&apos;s figures shows, be included in the German &quot;total.     Further, as regards prisoners of war J of whom some 5^,COO are included in the British ration strength -it is obvious, considering the numbers of prisoners of war in German   j hands, that these are not included in the German figures..     It - may confidently be stated, therefore that, had these considerations been   ; taken into account, there would have been shown a far smaller divergence between the percentages of combatant to ration strength.There is, however, a further consideration..    Partly owing to the fact that the British Armies in France and Italy are operating I in foreign countries where they have no installations(ports, docks, railways etc) of their own, and partly owing to the fact that, since we do not use England as a base, a considerable amount of double-handling of stores and munitions is necessitated, the ration strength of the British armies is swelled by a large amount of labour and a not inconsiderable number of men employed on headquarters staffs at bases.     It is clear that if supplies, munitions, stores etc., could be forwarded direct from shipment centres to railheads, as is possible in the case of the French and German armies, a large amount of double-handling would be eliminated and a considerable economy of labour realized. -   icoreorer,- as pointed out above, a large amount of the labour employed, e.&apos;g, in the docks and on the railways, would not appear in the returns of Army ration strength. If, for instance, one third of the transportation personnel, two-third] of the white, coloured, and alien labour, all prisoners of war and\
Q,*-M.A.A..&quot;C. employed by the British in prance were to be deducted, fron the ration strength, as being equivalent to civil and forced labour in the French and German armies, the difference between the British combatant and ration strength would be re*-duced by 300,000 and the percentage of the one to the other * woulc be brought up to figures almost as high as that gi^en by Dr. Addison for the German Army.The questions involved in war establishments and their amendment in the interest of economy or increased efficiency -factors which are ultimately   identical though at times apparently conflicting - are subjects of almost continuous consideration by branches of the Staff in the War Office, at General Headquarters, abroad, and on all the large formationso These establishments are being daily reviewed with the closest scrutiny.     At this moment, in particular, the size of the Army in France in the future is receiving the most anxious attention.     It is well recognised that the proportion of auxiliary services to fighting troops must change as the size of the force changes, and this subject, in connection with the armies in France, is now being closely investigated by the General Staff assisted by the administrative staff.   It is not the case, as Dr. Acldison^s memorandum seens %0- suggest, that the immense expansion of the British Army in France, haa. not involved great changes in the &quot;divisional organisation&quot; with which we started,   ho account is taken of the very iarge&apos; amount of Corps Troops, Army Troops. g.h,q.j troops and l.of C. troops outside the divisional organisation.     For instance, the proportion of the whole engineering and transportation services employed as divisional troops is comparatively small.     In this matter, in which we do not differ very greatly from the French and Germans, our po.&apos;iicy has always been to make our divisions self-contained mobile units, but we have not hesitated to make modifications as the result of war experience, and at this moment the proportion of certain divisional troops such as artillery and field ambulances is again under review.-As regards the proportion of administrative services generally in the British Army, this is admittedly high   but this is partly due to the fact that public opinion insists on a higher standard of comfort and care for the soldier than is considered necessary in France or Germany.     in view of the importance of maintaining moral and preventing the physical deterioration of the individual, it is probable that the result makes for economy in the long run.The question of the best use of available man-power is one that receives the constant attention of the military authorities&apos; but if it is considered that this is the time to review the framework of our expeditionary forces, it will be necessary to appoint a standing   committee, upon whioh General Headquarters, France, would have to be represented.The personnel of this committee would have to be freed from all other work, and devote their whole time to the enquiry,. Moreover, since our plans for 3.919 are now under consideration and would be vitally affected by any recommendations of such a committee, it would have to be constituted at the earliest possible moment.&apos;ljth July, 1918.1
