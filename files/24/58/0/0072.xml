M.P, to&apos;Wo^rimon nlBtoE Y-- ;    77Dear Mr. Prime Minister..,I haVe just come back from Ireland where I went to apeak on the lEtn July.   May I take the liberty of drawing your attention to one point,   In our stormy ,intercourse with Ireland we have tried  various remedies, both political and spiritual, witfcout ful1 succ ess.May. I venture to suggest that consideration might be given, when a suitable time arrives, to another kind of . remedy: that is, the possibility of constructins a Sunnei ^etweeii Groat Britain and Ireland.   There are, I uniarsta.nl, plans in existence; and a Railway Manager in Ireland yifrmel no -o?u&apos;c it would not be &quot;an.engineering impossibitir,y,   .U would, of course, have to . be undertaken as a national enterprise for it would not;pay as a private commerc ial venture.. I am induced to write this as many of the prejudices&apos; held in. Ireland.against Great Britain are due to ignorance,   The Irish, as a people, tend towards melancholy, whereas the English temperament is touch.more cheerful.I hope *o6 believe that, it would work out to the benefit of both peoples, if all possible points of contact were multiplied.&apos; An&apos;V it would in addition be of great military value as against &quot;Uw Boats * for,    toy nialajng slight railway adjustments,, every port in the West of Ireland would be available for use in case of need,I apologise for troubling ypU; when I know you are fully occupied; but if the idea appeals to you in any way, perhaps one of I)r. Addison1 s Reconstruction Committees  might make further enquiries&apos; into it.Believe me,:  Tory sincerely yours,::. (Sgd.) GSRSEOH ^TSftARI.The Rt. Hon. The Prime Minister.
