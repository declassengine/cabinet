THE VERSAILLES ORGANISATION.note Toy the aooretafry.I attaoh herewith the text of resolution.V of the last session of the supreme .ar Council as agreed to by the  ritish and Ifrenoh Prime Ministers.It will be remembered that this resolution waa temporarily in abeyance pending an interchange of views as to the precise drafting. The text, as agreed in the last few minutes of the session, was subsequently objected to by General Fooht with the result that ifr Clemenoeau and ieneral J&apos;och came to the Villa -vomaine after the Conferenoe to discuss the matter, and remained for two hours.   As the result of this prolonged discussion, it was thought that a text had be^n finally agreed to, and M. Orlando1s  aaseht was obtained to the British text on the same evening.   The English translation was made from a Very much corrected French manuscript, and had been compared by general .,oygand and myself; but when, after our return to England, the final French text was received, it was found to contain words which  were thought to have been erased,and did not appear in the Snglieh text.The-matter has now been adjusted, and the trench text has been agreed to by the prime uinieter on the distinct understanding that the words in sub-paragraph &amp; &quot;in consultation with General ^ooh&apos;* -(which are underlined in the attached copy) - mean that jenoral  och is to be consulted only ae to France and ItalyiIt still remains for Mi Orlando to accept the text, but there ia no reason co think; that he will disagree, aa exoept for the words under-linedt /he has already given hie assent.Pending the receipt of U. Orlando&apos;s agreement, when the Besolutir*n will, nave ieoeived the imprimatur ot* the supreme Jar Council, the Prime Minister has urged that the Versailles organisation shall press on with its studies of the future campaign.j&amp;, Whitehall Gardens, $iy 16, 1918.
