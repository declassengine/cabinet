LOSSES,The losses in June are the lowest in numbers since July 1916, and in tonnage since Sentember 1916. The total number of Merchant vessels of all sizes sunk during the month was 96 aggregating 248,000 tons gross. The losses for August 1916 were 121 vessels aggregating 158,000 gross tons, and for September 127 vessels of 226,000 gross tons.The losses in Home Waters are practically the same as May, the reduction taking place in other areas, even after taking into account the loss of ten vessels off the American Coast,SAILINGS AND LOSSES.Nearly 93/ of the Oversea traffic to an3. from the United Kingdom is now convoyed;   the losses in convoy during the month representing 0,59/ of the convoyed sailings, whilst those sunk before Joining or after dispersal from convoy represent 0.16/ of these callings, making a total of 0,75/ as against 0.97/ in May.   6,2^ of the non-convoyed sailings in Oversea trades were sunk,LIGHT conditions.In spite .of the longer days attacks in daylight show a considerable reduction,       60/ of the total attacks were in daylight, compared with 70/ in May,      Home Waters alone show an even greater reduction, the figures being 55/ of attacks in daylight in June and 79/ in May, This is mainly brought about by the increased number of night attacks on the East Coast.THREE MONTHS ENDED 50TH JUNE.In order to take a longer view of the Submarine operations, the results for&quot; the three months ended 30th June are compared with the preceding quarter.ATTACKS.The total attacks during the three months ended June have decreased by 95  or 18/ as compared with the previous quarter, and the losses by 60 or 20/.There is little change in the nercentage of enemy success   55,3/ and 53.6/ of the attacks resulting in loss in the two quarters.      The percentage damaged is the same in each quarter, namely 13,2/,A comparison of the attacks in the various areas during the two periods shows a marked improvement in the English Channel, the attacks having fallen from 46 per month in the first quarter to 28 per month.in the second quarter.with the preceding month andin the Mediterranean a reduction of 22 or 45/,      On the East Coast, however there is an increase of 14, equal to 82/:   the attacks in this area in June representing nearly 50$ of the ah hacks in Home Waters, compared with 19/ in May,       15 attacks took place of.r &quot;the Coast of America.
3. 101Although the proportion of attacks by daylight show a reduction for June, the number of daylight attacks in each quarter snows little variation either in Hone Waters or outside Home Waters. A large proportion of the reduction in Home Waters is in attacks in moonlight.The proportion of attacks both by day and by night in Home Waters withing10 miles of land remains constant each quarter at 60?!   but beyond    the 50-mile limit the percentage&apos;has increased from 1* j-,o 12$.LOSSES,The numbers and tonnage of Merchant Ships of all sizes sunk during the&apos;&quot;first two quarters of this year are as under:-	Mos.	.....&quot;&quot;&quot;:........................1........
