Although the rain has been heavy there are few oases of the corn being laid except in the Berks, Bucks and Oxon area, where wheat on some of the better land has suffered considerably,.   LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Essex.   The Executive Committee have taken possession of 161 acres of derelict building land at Cold Norton.    The Committee propose to cultivate this land on tho same system as other tracts of building land of which they are in possession.    The greater part of this land is being summer-fallowed during the present season. Worcestershire,   The Executive Committee have decided to cultivate a farm at Churchill, to which reference was made in last week!s , report, through the agency of the Women1 s War Agricultural Committee for the county,   .The soil is light, and although there is much cleaning to be ,done the farm is considered to be suitable for working by women. .Prosecutions.    The occupier of a smatll holding of 18-1 acres at Morwenstow, Cornwall, was fined  15 for non-compliance with an
order to cultivate j an acre with potatoes and 3 acres with corn, t Devon an owner of land has been fined  25 and  10 costs for failure comply with an order to breakup land in his occupation. A farmer Sandhill, Dorset, has been fined  20 for non-compliance with an ord to break up 14 acres of land. He was not short of labour and refused a soldier-labourer who was supplied to him on the ground th he was not a good milker. a farmer in Montgomeryshire was fined  2 for a similar offence.Determination of Tenancies.   During the week four Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 266 acres, and two orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 258 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Provision of land for Allotments. Reports received from 1,180 districts show that 312,614 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No,2), and that 287,471 plots containing 20,705 acres have been provided. During the week four Local Authorities have agreed to acquire, in addition to the above, 33 acres (205 allotments) including 13 acres at Easingwold (Yorks) and 6 additional acres at Coventry.The Abergavenny Elementary schools have taken 37 acres of land for cultivation, and 24 acres of this are now under potatoes. The children hire one or two rows of 100 yards each at 7s. per row, payable at the rate of 3d&apos;per week. This year 1,220 such rows have been let. The land is cultivated by horses, but the children assis with the planting, weeding and harvesting. Last year 210 tons of potatoes were produced by this means.Out of the 900 householders of Portmadoc 852 are either cultivating an allotment of from 4 to 8 poles, or a garden of about 6 poles.   The trustees of the Alexandra Palace have consented to tb cultivation of the 20 acres of land adjoining the Palace building/ and arrangements are being made for the aliens interned in the Palace to cultivate the land.
Fruit Section.   Two hundred and thirty demonstrations In fruit and vegetable preservation have been given during the week, while large exhibitions have been held at Messrs. Self ridgefs in Oxford Street, and at Halifax and &quot;/hitehaven.   Orders have been received by the Ministry of Munitions up to the 6th July for a total of 6,830,340 glass jars and the deliveries up to 30th June amounted to 3,506,100.Marketings   The following statement shows the progress of the scheme for establishing County Marketing Societies throughout the country:-Counties with registered Marketing Societies.....-18&quot;      undertaking marketing but which haveno registered County Society *...................  9Counties which have established Local Markets * * * * 4 Counties co-operating in a Federated Schemeof Marketing....................................  2Counties which are preparing to registerMarketing Societies...........................15Counties now engaged in preliminary organisation    2Blackberry Collection.   The Department have agreed to organise,jointly with the Ministry of Food, the collection of blackberriesthis season, and arrangements are now being made with theHorticultural Sub-Commit tees who will act as the Departmentsagents under this scheme.TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land.(1) A visit was paid to Boys Hall Farm In BastSuffolk, which was taken over by the Executive Committee in thespring of last year-   The farm is about 73 acres in extent, and whentaken over was in a deplorable condition, only 5 acres carrying acrop, and many of the fields having been derelict for years.   35acres are now under wheat, 13 acres under oats, 10 acres underbarley, 2 acres under mangolds, and 8 acres are bare fallow whichshould make a suitable seed bed for autumn wheat,   With theexception of the barley - which has not succeeded well in thedistrict - the grain crops are distinctly above average, the wheatespecially being remarkab?.y good.   The transformation that has beeneffected on thin farm in a short time is very striking and reflectsgreat credit on the Coiwnittee, ^
(2) Two other farms taken over by the East Suffolk... Exeouti Committee were inspected. Both of these holdings which were in very bad state of cultivation prior to occupation by the Commit; are now in excellent condition and carrying satisfactory crops., Anti-rook seed dressings. Investigations are In progress for discovering a dressing that shall make seeds distasteful to b without causing too much injury to germination. Seed Testing Station. About 7.600 samples have been received to date. Samples of crimson clover, cabbage and onion are still being received at the station. On the average the crimson clov samples show very poor gemination.IABOTH DTVISIOM. Agriculture and M5 lit ary 3er\-1 o3,   A return obtained by the Ministry of National Service shows that up to the 6th July, 21,278 men had been posted for military service from agriculture since the 29th April last.Arrangements are being made by the County Agricultural Executive Committees to take a complete census of the labour available for agriculture in the county, and enquiries are being addressed to each farmer as to the labour he has on his holding.    Committees have been Instructed to examine closely the returns received with a view to making the best possible use of the men left on farms by way of dilution etc. Harvest Labour.    During the week 623 men were made available for harvest work from Command depots on a month&apos;s agricultural furlough.    These men are being distributed by the Department in districts where harvest labour is most required.Reports received from the Executive Committees shew that in several counties a number of migratory gangs of prisone of war are already engaged on harvest work. Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on farms is 59,329.
Prisoners of ,War.     12 additional prisoner camps have been openedduring the week, making the total number of prisoners nowemployed on farm or drainage work as follows:-Prom 260 agricultural camps..............   15,284Employed from other camps................     1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms......   _36016,652Released aliens employed on agriculture ..     2,083Total...............   18,755In addition, 89 schemes for which prisoners have beenvoted are now under consideration by the War Office.     Theseprovide for the employment of a further 5,353 prisoners inagriculture.-WOMEN&apos;S BRANCH.Recruiting.   The Department have authorised the formation of a junior section of the Land Army to be composed of girls from 16 to 18 years of age.     Many requests for permission to enrol have been received from such girls.    They will be required to sign on for one year, but will be medically re-examined at the end of six months.    They will be trained only in centres and not on private farms and will afterwards live in Hostels under the supervision of a matron.Owing to the wet weather prevailing in London during the past week, it has not been possible to hold the desired number of recruiting meetings.    Meetings have, however, been held on the steps of the Croydon Town Hall, also at Leyton, and the East Ham Town Hall.    Meetings were held on Saturday In the market squares at Enfield and Bromley and also at Catford. 1   34 women were enrolled at Trafalgar Square on Saturday.     The total number of women enrolled on Saturday afternoon was 126 and for the whole week in London 539.A tour in Birmingham which was started on the 11th, Is producing good results, the average result being 50 recruits per day.
Training - Good reports have been received from one of the Training Centres in East Sussex, where before the centre was started there was great prejudice against women labour.   The farmers training the women have expressed themselves as delighted with their progress. Lectures are held at the centre in the evenings at which women from outside also attend. ,In Buckingham a certain number of women are receiving instruction in the management of binders in preparation for the harvest.&apos;   Arrangements are being made for thatching instruction at one of the Training Centres in Oxford. Employment - Hostels for the maintenance of women during employment have been opened this week in the East Riding of Yorks and in Leicester.

Up to the 13th July, 1,067 of the Fordson tractors which the Department have released to Messrs. HehTy Ford and Son had, been dispatched to farmers.During the week ended July 5th, 7,103 acres were ploughed, 2,169 acres cross ploughed and 10,9,83 acres cultivated.A report having been received from Glamorgan that Fordson tractors .and Oliver ploughs were unsuitable for work in the county, trials were carried out by an expert from headquarters which proved that if certain adjustments were made the tractors and ploughs could be successfully used. The engineer-contractors were instructed as to the adjustments required to ensure successful working of these tractors and ploughs. The Chief Executive Officer was satisfied with the result.Horse Scheme - The following figures show the position with regard tothe provision of horse-drawn implements for the week ended 13th Julyt-No. consigned to    Total No. oon* ootin*,.i/oT&quot;dqrTng      slgnecT to ^eoic&quot;. &quot;Hate.Carts and LorriesCultivators Disc Harrows DrillsHarruws and Drags Ploughs...2,564 1,397 753 1,475 3,16118 5,287Arrangements have been made by the War Office whereby instructions will be given through the Forage Department that, immediately after the requirements of the Army authorities are satisfied, hay will be bought in the stack in convenient localities for the use of each Executive Committee.   This arrangement should not only improve the quality of the hay supplied for the Department^ cj   horses, but shew an immediate saving of nearly  4 per horse in theworking of the existing scheme.   It will also avoid the transporta-1   tion by rail of nearly 10,000 tons of hay.   Arrangement^ whereby the necessary quantity of oats and oat-straw can be dealt with, on somewhat similar lines,are being completed.
Steam Tackle   .-The--*otalracreage. deaI.t&quot;Haritlrduring the past wq^ is as follows:-1,974 acres ploughed, 39,208 cultivated, 1,318 harrowed 166 mole drained, 137 rolled.     Total   &apos;4&amp;,803 acres. Arrangements,fpr l^Jgarvest - 82 Binders were consigned to count! during the week ended July 13th, making a total of 3,948 consigned date.   In addition 48 threshing machines were consigned, making a total of 217 consigned bo date.;A Committee, consisting chiefly of gentlemen connecter&quot;: the threshing trade, has been appointed to advise the Department upon the organisation of threshing during the coming season and tlx supply and training of labour required to man privately-owned and Government threshing tackle.SUPPLIES, DIVISION Sulphate, of Ammonia. Deliveries in June declined to 12,700 tons as compared with 19,500 tons in the preceding month.    There appears, however, to be a considerable demand for small quantities of sulphate of ammonia for top dressing.    Makers are being instructed to give preference to all applications which are stated to be required for immediate application to the soil. Lime.   All the principal lime works have recently been visited by the Supplies Inspectors with a view to considering what steps can be taken tu increase production and improve distribution. Labour is the main difficulty in maintaining or increasing the output, as no general protection has been given to this industry by the Ministry of National Service,, though it has been possible in some cases, to postpone the calling up of individual men. Increase in the price of coal tends to be reflected in the price of lime, and there is also difficulty i.n getting additional coal supplies.     It is hoped that it will be . fts.sible to show an increased production this autumn
1 s nBinderrffwine. Six or eight local depots are now being established for the storage of twine to meet the requirments of the Government binders and of any farmers who may be short of supplies at harvest time.ffart, ftiaeasa of Potatoes.   A further number of districts have been certified as &quot;infected areas&quot; under the Wart Disease of Potatoes Order of 1918, in the counties of Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, and Westmorland.     Other areas are now under observation.incidenceof fflftffht.    During the past week no new areas have been found to be affooted by potato blight, but the disease has spread to some extent both in N.W. Wales and in the Isle of Wight.    With the change in the weather, blight may soon appear in other parts of the country, especially in the southern counties. Horse-drawn Potato Sprayers.   Potato spraying is now in full swing in the South Western counties under the direction of the Agricultural Executive Committees.    the scheme is specially comprehensive in Somerset, where machine, horse, labour and chemicals are being supplied at an inclusive charge.    In Cornwall the maohine sent to Truro sprayed some 70 acres of charlock with most satisfactory results, and the Bodmin machine has sprayed 60 acres of potatoes as well as 50 acres infested with oharlockr    Cambridgeshire has been for this purpose divided into seven districts to prevent loss oif time in travelling from farm to farm.    The Committee provides machine, tubs and a trained woman , worker.Damage of Potato &apos;flrops by Frost.   Careful observations and enquiries have been made in North Wilts, where the frosts of June 16th and 21st caused considerable damage to the crops. Special Terms to enable Allotment Associations to purchase Seeds in Bulk.   As a result of a series of conferences with representatives of the seed trade and of Allotment Associations
an &quot;arrangement has now-been made whereby the United Council, of the Seed Trade Association is recommending its wholesale members] to execute bulked seed orders for associations of allotment holders to the value of  100 and upwards at wholesale catalogue prices.     It is also being suggested that bulked orders of less value should be met by country firms who are partly wholesale and partly retail, at the same price, plus a slight extra charge] to cover cost of handling.    The wholesalers will, however, reserve the right to refuse orders if they are not received earl) in the season.    A discount of 5$ will be allowed for cash payme Importation of Seeds from the U.S.A. Many seed firms have com-plained of the delay caused by the new regulations which requlrf application to be made to the Import Restrictions Department fo a permit before parcels of seeds can be purchased in the U.S.A, These permits are necessary in connection with the consideratloi by the British War Mission at Washington of applications for permission to apply to the United States War Trade Board for licences to export.Arrangements have now been made to obtain from the principal seed firms particulars of the quantities of seeds mil they will probably wish to purchase in the U.S.A. during the nej twelve months.    These particulars will be forwarded to the Im] Restrictions Department, who have agreed to issue, on the recoi mendation of this Department, general permits covering the toll quantities of seeds represented by these proposed purchases.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,ooedienDirector-General.The Rt. Hon. Row land E. Prothero, 84.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
