Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate to my colleagues on the Imperial War Cabinet a note 1 recently received from Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Theodore Mori sou, K..C.SJ,, KXU.lv, formerly a Member of.the Council of India, regarding the future of German East Africa.Sir T. Mori son has lately returned from German East Africa, where ho has lined the following appointments :--August 1916-Apri] 1.917.-.....District Political Officer, Moslii.April 19.17-September 19.17.- Attached to Belgian Headquarters and engaged onmiscellaneous inspection for General Headquarters. October 19.17-April 191.8.-Senior Political Officer.E. S. M.India Office, 10th July 1.91.8.A COLONY FOR INDIA.One of the Imperial questions of which the settlement after the war will be very urgent is that of the migration of Indians within the Commonwealth. Although admit ted to most of the tropical Crown Colonies which are inhibited by coloured people, they are cle facto excluded from the great and prosperous Dominions in Australasia, America and the Union of South Africa. It is possible to argue that the material damage inflicted on India by this exclusion is not really considerable because her people have no desire to emigrate in large numbers. This is perhaps true, but no one familiar with India will maintain that the exclusion is not very bitterly resented, and that it does not tend to chill Indian enthusiasm for the Empire. It seems to me inevitable that Indians should resent the treatment they receive at the -hands of the Dominions. They feel, they have been made to feel, that they are kept out because thoy belong to an inferior race, and no people can be expected to suffer such an affront without being deeply wounded. Such insults, as Mr. Gokhale said, cut more deeply than the slash, of a whip. But, great as is the injury to India, there is not the remotest chance that the Dominions will reconsider their policy in this matter; the reasons which have caused them to adopt it are too serious and too enduring to permit us to cherish such a hope. Each of them has, on domestic grounds, an unanswerable case against Indian immigration. Australia has made great sacrifices for her ideal of a white Australia; the Canadian Provinces on the Pacific would weaken their position with regard to Chinese immigration if they opened their ports to Indians ; South Africa in her coloured native population has already a terrific problem to solve, and may very reasonably refuse further to complicate it by the admission of Indians. These local and special reasons give each individual Dominion, a very strong case, but in their bearing upon India the result of them all. is much the same and the conclusion of the whole matter very unsatisfactory. The Indian finds that he is, in fact, turned away from one port after another, and that the Empire, to which he is asked to contribute his share of blood and treasure, can make room for him only in those petty and unhealthy countries in which the white man cannot make a home.These are the elements of the problem which demands solution. It is encouraging that the most thoughtful men in India now recognise that the case for a wdiite Australia, a wdiite Canada, and for the exclusion of Indians from South Africa is a strong one, and that the policy of the Dominion Parliaments, however unsatisfactory to Indians, is not without reasonable foundation. But has not the time come for the statesmen of the Empire to recognise that the Indian grievance, too, has a reasonable foundation and that an honest attempt should he made to meet it ? With, goodwill a solution can be found. It is a case for an honourable bargain, for a treaty between the nations&apos;of the Commonwealth, The Dominions must reserve unquestioned their right to exclude what classes or races they like ; India must renounce that claim to unrestricted migration within the Empire which she has never been able to enforce. But the magnitude of this renunciation must be recognised, and India must receive compensation by having assigned to her a portion of the&apos; Empire in which, she will have special interests and a privileged position.SS 633  60  7/18 &apos; A
I have heard it suggested that Mesopotamia now affords us an excellent opportunity of meeting India&apos;s claims; that Mesopotamia is potentially a land of enormous wealth, lying close to India, and therefore admirably suited to become Inclia&apos;s Colony. This suggestion may be dismissed at once; India would not listen to it. The forcible inclusion of Mesopotamia in the Indian Empire would be deplored by Hindu and Mulmmadan alike. This is a matter of sentiment; it is no good arguing that the sentiment is unreasonable ; it is there ; any policy which disregards it is doomed to disappointment. You might as well attempt to commend, Home Rule in Ireland to the English elector by suggesting that a Nationalist Government in Dublin would probably offer land in Ulster to English settlers. Mesopotamia can nevei&apos; l.)o India&apos;s Colony.But there is one territory, conquered, not from Turkey but from Germany, which India would he glad to see assigned to her; that territory also lies at her door, and is great and important enough to be adequate compensation for ail that India is asked to renounce. That territory is German East Africa. If the war ends in a victory for the Allies this Colony must never be allowed to return to Germany. Whatever becomes of her other Colonies in Africa, the Commonwealth can never afford to see Germany re-established on the East Coast. The magnificent harbours of Tanga, Dar-es-Salam and Kilwa would in German hands become so many bases from which their submarines would prey upon the shipping of Durban and Lorenzo Marques to the south, and cut off the trade with India and the East by bottling up the lied Sea to the north. As long as it is in our power to refuse it, we should never consent to the restoration of this Colony to Germany, and it is upon this assumption that I urge that it should be assigned to India on the condition that she accepts it in full settlement of her claims to free movement in the Empire. If the claims that India is asked to renounce are great, the compensation offered her is not inadequate. German East Africa is no mean country ; it covers an area of 385,000 square miles; it is almost twice the size of Germany, or, to put the case in Indian dimensions, it covers an area equal to the British Provinces of Bengal, Behar and Orissa, the United Provinces, the Punjab, and the. North-West Frontier Province all together. And this great extent of territory is not like the districts which lie between Peshawar and Calcutta, already so thickly populated as to offer little room to immigrants ; on the contrary, it is a land crying out for population ; by comparison with India it is hardly inhabited at all. All this huge area has as yet but 7^ million inhabitants,1 approximately the population of two districts in Bengal. Even, these figures give no idea of how thinly the people are spread over the greater part of the country. Of this scanty population almost half (3-i- million) are aggregated in the two districts of Euancla and IJrundi, in the extreme north-western corner of the Colony; the rest of the country is almost uninhabited. Here and there along the coast are a few patches of population, but on the Central Railway, which runs from the Indian Ocean to Lake Tanganyika, you may travel for hours without seeing any trace of human life ; far as the eye can reach stretches the interminable bush, only interrupted now and again by an open plain, from, which herds of feeding buck or zebra look up in wonder, and then once more the never-ending bush re-asserts it cheerless supremacy. And yet the land is not sterile ; even to the rough tillage of the natives it yields abundant harvests of mealies, Kaffir corn and. manioc; and it is capable of producing crops whic,h have a high value in the world&apos;s markets. Some of the best coffee in the world is grown on the slopes of Kilimanjaro; sisal, which now-a-days yields an almost fabulous profit, will grow in nearly every district; while cotton, sugar-cane, rubber, cereals, copra, palm oil and groundnuts all do well in different parts of the country. During the campaign I spoke to many Indian soldiers, who for the most part were small farmers at home; they, poor fellows, had little reason to love East Africa, but they were unanimous in their praise of its wonderful fertility. The soil will grow anything, they said, and the rains are better than in India. One of them told me how he had measured a sugar-cane that was 8 inches in girth; another how he had seen a field of wheat, of which one-third was being reaped, another third coming into ear, and the remainder of the crop springing green out of the soil ; so regularly does the earth yield her increase in this unvarying climate. Perhaps the best testimony to the natural wealth of German East Africa-which I heard was from the members of the Council of the Ismailis or Khojas, an Indian community which does almost all the trade of East Africa ; the men with whom -I spoke were themselves substantial merchants who had been settled in Zanzibar for several generations, and1 7,659,898 according to the German Annual Report of 1912-13.
06they, had intimate relations with all the Khoja communities upon the East Coast and the hinterland ; they had, therefore, exceptional opportunities for ganging the commercial value oi&apos; the country. To my surprise they gave it as their unanimous opinion that German Mast Africa was a wealthier colony than British East Africa; they recognised that its.resources wore as yet very inadequately developed, but they asserted that its native products alone, copra, hides, beeswax, ivory, groundnuts, &amp;c., already afforded material for a very valuable trade. &quot; What do you think the country would be worth &quot;I asked, &quot;if it were developed by Indian agriculturists ?&quot; &quot;Oh, then,&quot; they replied, with one voice, &quot; it would be one of the richest.countries in the world.&quot;German East Africa is a country so vast, so suitable for Indian colonization, and potentially so rich that India may be well content to accept it as compensation for her exclusion from the Dominions. But she cannot so accept it unless the statesmen of the Commonwealth assign to her a privileged position, in that part of the world and recognise that it is India&apos;s possession with, whose administration they have no right to interfere. India must have freedom, in directing the policy to be pursued in her colony; she must have the right to control immigration and, consequentially, to exclude from her territory in East Africa immigrants from other parts of the Commonwealth. Let us consider what use India would make of these privileges. One of her first tasks would bo to organise immigration from her own shores. Having decided, with due regard to native interests, what areas were suitable to Indian immigrants, she would bring over Indian agriculturists and settle them on the land. I conceive that this would for the most: part he carried out in the traditional. Indian way. The younger sons of Raises and Zemindars would leave India with a band of adventurous young men from their own neighbourhood, clear the African jungle and build villages, so that, as of old, a living part of India&apos;s social life would be trans-planted and would develop in a new country. They would bring with them their village craftsmen, the carpenter to make their ploughs and carts, the weaver to weave their homespun clothes and the potter to turn their cottage utensils upon his wheel. These men, self-sufficient in their little village communities, would be genuine pioneers and colonists ; they would indeed live hard and simple lives but they would be rich in corn and gld, the two synonyms of wealth in village tradition. As communications developed they would provide a large surplus of food for export overseas. As, from her myriad little farms, India to-day not only feeds her own enormous population but also provides a goodly margin for export, so from the Indian villages dotted about the great wastes of East Africa, a thousand little rills of food-stuffs would trickle down to Dar-es-Salam and form a great stream of export. India would, in fact, by the normal functioning of her industrial organisation, pour into East Africa a flood of small settlers, that very class of IdelnsiedLcr whom the German administration was constantly trying&apos;to attract to the Colony but of whose chronic failure to make good, their own blue books are melancholy testimony. And, para-doxical as it may appear, these Indian villagers would contribute more to the economic strength of the Empire than the wealthy and enterprising white planter. From the very nature of their rural economy they must grow foodstuffs, and as they would find the soil and climate well suited for the crops with which they were familiar at home, they would little by little turn East Africa into one of the great food producing areas of the world. The white planter has failed to develop this side of the country&apos;s possibilities. He has, very naturally, devoted his energies to growing sisal, coffee, rubber and other tropical products which fetch a high price in the European markets and he has been content to import from abroad the corn, rice, &amp;c, which he needed for his own subsistence. At the present moment East Africa, which ought to be feeding our armies in Mesopotamia and Palestine and contributing to the food supplies of the Allies, is actually adding to the strain upon the world&apos;s supplies of wheat and rice and mealie meal. This is fundamentally unsound and no scheme of colonization can bo considered satisfactory which is not broad-based upon the production of the great staples of corn and meat.The Indian immigrant would, as I have said, usually be a small farmer, but I would not exclude the possibility of development by great companies. There are some tropical products, notably sisal, which demand for their successful exploitation considerable expenditure of capital. In -German days the production of sisal was most successful in the hands of big companies like the Deutsch (Estafrikanische Gesellschaft, which owned big plantations and equipped them with trolley lines and costly machinery. Most of these plantations are now in ruins, the bush has swallowed up the younger plants, the older ones have &quot;poled&quot; and only charges of dynamite
can clear a path through the tangled growth. but the production of sisal fibre, even if new ground&apos; lias to be cleared, is a very attractive proposition, and the talas, mnldiarjis arid industrial magnates of western india should have opportunities of carrying on the work of the big german firms&apos;. these wealthy concerns that can afford to sink a good deal of capital undoubtedly contribute a valuable element in the development of the country, but it is an element which 1 rate less highly than a vigorous peasantry., but the cultivation of the waste spaces is not by any means the only advantage which i see from, the association, of the country willi india. government in east africa is still rudimentary; neither in the british nor german possessions has the administration done anything like enough for the country ; the essential functions of government are inadequately discharged and other functions, desirable though not essential, are not discharged at all. how this can be remedied, seems to me one of the very difficult questions awaiting solution in the next decade. will england, bled white by the war, be able to fi rid the men to stall&apos; all her own dependencies? can she take on new liabilities with any reasonable prospect of meeting them adequately ? those who know how difficult it was even before the war to meet the e.mp.ire&apos;s unceasing demand for men will hesitate to answer in the affirmative.but we do know that india&apos;s reservoirs of manhood are almost inexhaustible ; we do know that her scientific and technical colleges are improving yearly and that they are pouring.forth an increasing stream of graduates.   india could find the men. for those technical departments of which the new colony stands in such urgent need. ivurki, sibpnr and the other engineering colleges would provide the men to build her roads, bridges, railways, and public works.    dehra dun would furnish her neglected forests with conservators.   the medical colleges in bombay, calcutta and lucknow would supply the doctors who are so much wanted.   tho medical care of the native population was mostly left by the german government to missionaries; their means and competence are small and they do not cover the whole field.   i should like to see at least one. qualified medical officer in each district with a station hospital at headquarters and out-station dispensaries,  in all the  sub-districts. assistant surgeons and sub-assistant surgeons, trained in india, are quite competent to undertake these duties: they may not be up to the high standard of ifaiiey street, but they would be an immense improvement on the present state of things and an incalculable blessing to the people.   regarding the value of indian help in this matter, i speak from experience as i received most valuable assistance, spontaneously offered and entirely unrenumerated, from captain abdul hakim of rampur.   i well renfember the surprise and gratitude of the native chief and his people whom captain abdul hakim visited during an epidemic.   &quot; the bwana mganga (doctor) not only saw the sick and gave them medicines,&quot; they told me, &quot; but he even went and visited them in their houses.   he used to make a round every day and attended them in their huts!&quot;    so little does the poor african expect even from the most merciful of professions !   besides curative practice there is in east africa an almost unlimited field for preventive medicine and sanitation.   every district should have its sanitation gang and &quot;mosquito brigade &quot; under a trained sanitary officer to fight the countless insects which communicate disease.   india could produce men capable of controlling this district work.   much research in the laboratories is still needed to enable man to obtain control of other diseases which, like sleeping sickness, have hitherto defied science.   i do not know of any indians who have yet made contributions to bacteri-ology, but when once it is realised how deeply india&apos;s reputation is involved in finding a solution of this, the gravest problem in east africa, i have confidence that a school of indian, scientists will concentrate their energies upon this branch of research. indeed the value of a colony to india would not lie so much in offering scope for the known and proved capacity of her sons as in eliciting fresh talents and in stimulating indians to fruitful work towards practical, ends of which they have not yet recognised the urgency.   there are two other departments of government for which india could not find the staff unless her scientific colleges expand in response to this new opportunity : these are the agricultural and veterinary departments.   the opportunities awaiting these two departments in east africa are enormous.   the natives need to be shown new methods of agriculture to replace their wasteful and inefficient tillage ; new crops should be introduced and new varieties of indigenous staples imported. all the manifold activities of pusa are not equal to the demands of african agriculture. for veterinary surgery the scope is unlimited.    an improvement in the breed of cattle is one of the crying needs of the country; the wretched native cow gives no more than a pint of milk a day; the scrawney oxen are good neither for meat nor
draught, and these miserable herds are decimated periodically by rinderpest, east coast fever and other local murrains. no form of administrative activity would so powerfully impress the african native with the beneficence of his new governors as efficient care of his beloved cattle.. those who are familiar with modern india will net, i think, dispute her ability to find the men for the executive and judicial services. the best of her deputy collectors and. tahsildars would make excellent district officers ; among her sub-ordinafe judges are to be found men who could preside with credit over any court in east africa. i go farther than this, and. am prepared to advocate that the military defence of the colony should be put in indian hands. the indian. colony should raise its own african regiments on the model of the existing king&apos;s african rifles battalions. the educated, young men who now become deputy superintendents in the indian police have in them the stuff from which to make good regimental officers with coloured troops. as a further measure of precaution the young indians born and bred. in. the colony, should be liable to compulsory training in a territorial force and so form a military reserve which would&apos; be of great value to the government in the event of a native rising or a foreign invasion.the proposals which i have sketched constitute, i am well aware, a startling departure from, the traditional policy of the commonwealth, but i do not think india can be expected to acquiesce in her exclusion from the dominions unless she receives compensation, upon some such scale as this. to those who may, not unnaturally, hesitate to. sanction so momentous an experiment, i would point out that quite irrespective of the settlement of inclia&apos;s grievance, the commonwealth would gain two solid advantages from india&apos;s connection with east africa.   these advantages are (i.) that the country would become a great food-producing area. (2) that the country would be effectively administered, and each department of the administration would have an ad ecru at 3 staff.this last consideration is one to which i attach great importance. i confess that i am haunted by the fear that after the war there will not be enough englishmen &quot; to go round. &quot; the dependencies, while at the same time i entirely agree with- the disciples of cecil rhodes, who hold that every undeveloped area is a danger to the empire.and what, under this scheme, will, become of the african native ? this is the biggest question of all, and i have left it to the last in order to deal with it fully. the native&apos;s interest is the cardinal consideration on which every policy in east africa should turn. he has an older title to the land that any late comers, german, english, or indian, and iris rights must be safeguarded before the demands of any immigrants can even be considered. that the africans must be under the tutelage of some foreign power needs no demonstration ; though not unintelligent they are as yet ignorant of almost all the arts of civilisation; they have only the rudiments of political organisation and are entirely wanting in cohesion ; they are in consequence totally incapable of offering resistance to any invader. a modern filibuster with a couple of companies of infantry could march from one end of the country to- another and bring it all under subjection. no sort of native autonomy can be seriously considered. but for the very reason that the natives are incapable of defending their own interests, we should be the more scrupulous in safeguarding their rights to the uttermost.now, i believe that the influence of india would be more beneficial to the native than that of europe and that the ultimate justification of the policy here outlined will be found in the civilisation of the negro. the white man, we may confess, has not been very successful in educating the native of east africa. in spite of some 20 or 30 -years&apos; contact with englishmen and germans the native is still ignorant of such primary arts as (1) ploughing, (2) weaving, (3) sinking a well. the reason for this is not far to seek. the white man attains his ends by very complicated processes which are entirely above the native^ comprehension. the white - farmer, very wisely, breaks up his land with, a steam plough or at least with a massive steel plough and a long team of oxen. his clothes are woven by machinery and imported from that unknown &quot;ulaya&quot; from which the white man himself comes. if he wants water, he sinks an artesian well and conjures it from under-ground by contrivances which appear to be magical. these mysterious processes offer no useful lesson to the negro; even if he comprehended them he could not himself command the implements which are necessary to their execution. i think it is a mistake to assert that the native is not shrewd enough to pick up a hint when he can turn it to practical use. he is often laughed at, because, it is asserted, he has in the last 30 years taken from tho white man only the umbrella and the tin mug.SS 633 B
When I met for the first time a naked Masai herding cattle with a black umbrella over his head the effect was&apos;so whimsical that I joined in the laugh against the poor negro.   But a little reflection might have shown me that there are very few things, except the umbrella and the tin mug, which the native could take from our houses and farms that would be of any use to him.   All that the experience of the last 80 years proves is that our highly complicated civilisation affords the native very few useful hints or practical suggestions.    But, on the other hand, the domestic and rural economy of an Indian village is very much more within his grasp, and from contact with an Indian cultivator he could get ideas which he could transplant unchanged into&apos;his own. life.   Ploughing, weaving and well-sinking as performed by an Indian peasant are processes which..he could comprehend and adopt.   The Inclian&apos;s plough is little more than, a sharp stick which any African fund I could cut from the bush himself.   All his other tools are equally simple ; the native would learn how to use them, almost unconsciously ; an Indian farmer would get him to lend a hand in breaking in his bullocks or in driving them while he guided the plough, or employ him to do some of the digging, when, with his friends, he sank a well; and the native-has brains enough to see what tools and what processes he can employ for himself. One illustration came under my own observation.   When I was political officer at lVloshi, I one day told the natives of my office that I. wanted to see how the Wachaga lived and all that they did.   The Wachaga are the tribe that inhabit Kilimanjaro, and were, therefore, my principal preoccupation.   The &quot; boys &quot; of my office wore all. Wachaga and very proud of their tribe ; in great glee they undertook to show me all the glory of Chagalaud, and particularly of their smiths who have a great reputation thereabout.   So we devoted one Sunday to roaming idly among the woods and bananas of the glorious mountain,   A roving Punjabi who bad lived for seven or eight years in those parts attached himself to our train, and displayed, I regret to say, as much racial arrogance as ever an Englishman diet in. India.   In. confidential Hindustani he explained to me that these natives were so ignorant that they made no use of their wonderful soil which would grow anything.   As we drew near the spot where a smith was said to be at work we came upon some charred logs and Xathu pounced upon them with derision.   &quot; This is what these &quot; people call charcoal ; it&apos;s not proper charcoal, only burnt wood ; see, all the &quot; strength has gone out of it.&quot;   He proceeded in voluble Suaheli to. give the aecom-panying &quot;Wachaga a lecture on the proper principles of charcoal, burning.   Being myself totally ignorant of this art, I discouraged the discussion and. moved on to the smith&apos;s wdiom I found squatting beneath a little grass roof held up on four sticks.. Some embers of the inferior charcoal were burning in a little heap which the smith blew up from time to time with, bellows made of a goat skin ; the spear he was fashioning was poked into the embers and. taken out to hammer when red hot.   All the processes were much like what one sees in a village smithy in India, but all the tools, with one exception, were more rude and clumsy.   The heap of embers was not surrounded, as in India, with a little bulwark or, lip, of clay to conserve the heat; the bellows had a wooden nozzle which could not be put in the fire, so the smith had perforated, a stone longitudinally and clapped one end on the nozzle of his bellows and pushed the other into the glowing embers.   The exception, however, which at once caught my eye was the anvil.   It was a neat little iron anvil fixed into the ground by a spike or foot; every farrier in India carries a similar one about with, him.   &quot; Where did you get that ? &quot; I asked.   &quot; Oh,&quot; replied the smith, &quot; when I went to-Voi I saw it in some Indian workshops and bought it.&quot;   &quot;And what did you use before?&quot; I asked.   &quot;Like all. the Wachaga I used these,&quot; he, replied, pointing to some round stones, about the size of a man.&apos;s head, which lay about him.   Unhandy things they were, as I afterwards saw in other places; the smiths would turn them&quot; &quot;over until they found a face reasonably suited to the need of the moment, and hammer at the spear or knife balanced on this unsteady surface. My Wachaga train had never before seen so serviceable an anvil, and they were immensely proud of their fellow-tribesman^ progress in his craft.   Indeed, the simple story was wholly creditable to-the Mchaga smith.   Some chance had taken him a hundred miles from his native mountain; seeing some foreign smiths at work he had, with laudable curiosity,, turned in to watch them. He noticed among their tools one that was a great improve--ment upon anything of the kind he had overseen; at once he invested what must, have been -for him a large sum in the purchase of this better tool, and he carried it. back to his little smithy on the steep slopes of Kilimanjaro.   What would this man have learned had he been taken over the steel and iron works of Sheffield?   He would have gaped in stupefied wonder at all that clanging machinery, but he would.
not have brought away one idea to improve his simple craftsmanship. I used to talk over this question with the Bishop of Kilimanjaro, a thoughtful Alsatian, who was keenly interested in the progress of the African, and he summed up his conclusion in these words, &quot; L&apos;indigene apprenderait beaucoup plus facilenient de lTndien que&apos;de 1&apos;Europeen pareeque 1&apos;Indien est son. semblable.&quot;But Indian immigration would not in itself suffice to produce results beneficial to the native. Left to his own devices the Indian trader or settler is no more a humanitarian than the white trader or settler. I imply no reproach to the one or the other.   The education of the native is not their job.   They emigrate to find a home&apos; in a new country and to make a fortune or at least a competence; it is unreasonable to expect them to be distracted from that end by so alien a consideration as the improvement of the native.   But the welfare and elevation of the indigenous races should be the pre-occupation of the administration, and the question to be answered is whether Indian administrators would recognise this duty and live up to it.   Let me put the relevant questions quite bluntly.    Could a government composed of Indians lie trusted to work disinterestedly for the welfare of the natives ?   Would they be clear of racial prejudice ?   Would they hold the balance true between native and Indian ?   Wrould they check their countrymen from the selfish exploita-tion of a weak and inferior race ?   Would they in good faith educate the native and train him to compete successfully with Indians ?   These are searching questions and few white Governments in Africa could answer them without reserve.   The Indian is not more of an idealist than the Englishman, and I do not pretend to think that the conduct of the Indian official will be such as to put us to shame unless he receives adequate instructions from his own Government.   All will turn upon that.   His Government must declare that the education and elevation of the negro is its object; it must formulate this policy and issue instructions for giving it effect; the officials will carry out these instructions, some with more, others with less, enthusiasm ; but if the policy is clear and the instructions unequivocal, the Civil Service will lie faithful instruments in executing them.   Now the public opinion of India will certainly insist that her policy should be generous to the African native.   Tt is of the very essence of my suggestion that this whole question of an Indian Colony should be put squarely before the Indian public.   They are to be invited to settle an outstanding grievance,, to conclude a treaty with the other nations of the Commonwealth.   They are to be asked to renounce an ancient claim and to undertake new responsibilities. For what they renounce they are to receive large material compensation.   In what they undertake they are offered a splendid opportunity.   They are given a chance of proving their right to a higher status in the Empire ; they are invited to become a colonising power and to play a part in civilising the wild ; if I may use a phrase which they have little reason to love, they are called to share the white man&apos;s burden. I shall be much surprised if India does not value the opportunity far more highly than, the material advantage.    This is what self-respecting Indians have long demanded.   They ask for the chance of showing that in the higher qualities of humanity, they are not inferior to the white man.   I have myself an honest conviction that the Indian can do better things than have yet been asked of him ; but I too say with the Indian : &quot;Let these big iDretensions.be put to the test.&quot;   Here is a chance for them to show what Indians are worth.   East Africa is a big stage, and on it they are called to play a great part, but it is not an easy one ; it will demand all the powers they possess and in the neighbouring British Colonies they will have a critical audience which will not gooclnaturedly condone their shortcomings.   If they accept the test they must abide by the result; if they fail to justify themselves they cannot afterwards claim for India a higher status in the Commonwealth than she enjoys to-day.T.
