SECRETMINISTRY  OF  FOOD.f/o^f--1--Report for Week ending Wednesday, July 10, 1918.The King has been pleased to approve the appointment of the Right Hon. John Robert Clynes, M.P., to be Food Controller in succession to the late Right Hon. the Viscount Rhondda.A memorial service for Viscount Rhondda was held at St. Margaret&apos;s, Westminster, on Tuesday, Julp 9. The King was represented by Lord Annaly, Queen Alexandra by Earl Howe, and the Duke of Connaught by Colonel Sir Malcolm Murray.The members of the Baltic, with which Lord Rhondda was associated for many years, held a memorial service on Monday, July 8, at St. Andrew&apos;s Undershaft. Lord Devonport was among those present.Messages of condolence were sent by the Canada Food Board and by the United States Food Administration. Mr. Hoover said that Lord Rhondda had contributed by his statesmanship and ability to the feeding of the entire allied world and had carried them through a year of such difficulties as would probably never again be confronted.PART I. ACTION TAKEN.On Wednesday, 10th July, in the House of Lords, Lord Crawford, in answer to Lord Chaplin, stated that the amounts expended by the Ministry of Food during the first six months of the present year were as follows : 1918.	Administration.	Purchase of Foodstuffs,	Total.February..... April       -      -June ------	  99,231 193,873 230,142 188,872 137,649 334,490	  16,767,651 23,428,329 30,572,188 36,022,250 39,849,466 37,361,127	  16,866,882 23,622,202 30,802,330 36,211,122 39,987,115 37,695,617	1,184,257	184,001,011	185,185,268The administrative expenditure is larger in March and June than in the other months because the expenses of Local Committees are met by quarterly payments made in those months; and also because in order to meet the convenience of the bankers the payment of monthly salaries, amounting to about 34,000L was made upon June 1 instead of May 31, a practice which will be continued in future months. These figures do not include the payments made by the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies or the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply. The number of the staff employed at June 30 was : at Headquarters, 5,183 ; Local Food Control Committees and Provincial Organisations, 6,750; total, 11,933. The annual amount of their salaries is approxi-mately 1,730,0001., being an average of 1451. per head. The Fourth Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure summarised the policy of the Ministry as follows : &quot; The policy adopted is that of equalising the price of a given commodity, wherever bought by the Ministry, and selling the whole of the resultant product at a flat cost price which includes freight, insurance, and all adminis-trative expenses.&quot;The Food Controller, accompanied by the Director of Meat Supplies, attended a meeting of the London members of the House of Commons, who were considering representations from the Incorporated Society of London Meat Trades, to the effectA  (33)6075-2   Pkl   135  7/18  EfcS
that the imported meat was of inferior quality, and that London gets less than its fair share of home-killed meat.It was explained that each district obtained: its fair share of both imported and home-killed meat, and that whereas formerly the best meat went to the wealthier classes, under rationing, an equal proportion went to rich and poor alike. The hope was-expressed that a much larger quantity of home-killed meat would be consumed than was at present available.The Consumers&apos; Council unanimously expressed their satisfaction at the appoint-ment of Mr. Clynes as Food Controller and assured him of their utmost assistance in the fulfilment of his important task.Sir William Goode outlined the results of the voluntary efforts made by the American people to supply the Allies with food. Between July 1, 1917, and April 1, 1918, 80,000,000 bushels of wheat and wheat products were exported, four times the Official estimate of the amount available. In March of this year the amount of pork and pork products reached 308,000,000 lbs., being 50 per cent, more than in.any previous month of the last seven years ; in the same month 86,000,000 lbs. of beef and beef products were shipped.It is worth noting that the Agenda for the forthcoming Trades Onion Congress contains no reference to food questions, notwithstanding that some seventy resolutions are down for discussion.At the Food Controllers request, Mr. Beveridge attended the Annual Conference of the Grocer&apos;s Federation, at Stoke-on-Trent, and addressed them on the policy of the Ministry.The first meeting of the Central Agricultural Advisory Council will be held at the Surveyors&apos; Institute on the 16th inst., when Mr. Prothero, the President of the Council, will open the proceedings.Control of Supplies.Allied Requirements. Sir Guy Granet and Mr. Charles Dalziel have arrived from New York in order to confer on various matters connected with British purchases in North America.At Mr. Hoover&apos;s suggestion, the Food Controllers of the Allied countries will meet in London on or about 22nd July.Cables have been exchanged on the subject of bad condition, of arrivals of frozen meat, which are causing considerable dissatisfaction. It was urged that packers must be made to deliver meat alongside ships in hard frozen condition ; and that the decision of masters as to rejection of soft-meat should be final. Meat that has had to be re-frozen should be sold at a loss rather than shipped. It was stated in reply that other causes than the shipment of soft beef contributed to bad conditions on arrival. Foi instance, the present system of bringing coal and clay in refrigerated chambers of some steamers as ballast increases the clanger, as cleaning and cooling cannot be done before arrival and in necessary war hurry by steamers being primarily troop carriers and having to sail on schedule it is sometimes difficult for this to be done properly after arrival, also often results in railway cars being kept waiting. Undoubtedly, also, efficiency of refrigerated machinery on some steamers is not up to pre-war times and makes them not suitable for beef. Ministry of Shipping are arranging for their engineers to pick out best boats and as far as possible use the others for bacon only. ^It has been decided that the Assistant Director of Meat Supplies, the Hon. Algernon Borthwick, shall go to New York to examine the situation and take the necessary measures to apply a remedy.Bacon, Earns, and Lard. Representative London importers will in future attend the weekly meetings with the Liverpool importers held at this Ministry. This will keep the Ministry more fully informed of trade difficulties as they arise.Export of bacon and hams from Ireland has ceased for the present, as the Food Control Committee for Ireland does not find any exportable surplus.Butter. On July 8th a distribution of butter and the amount of 25 per cent, of the month&apos;s applications was made, together with a small supplementary distribution in view of the increased ration.On July 6th the stocks in hand amount to 23,500 tons, the arrivals during the week being 2,422 tons.
Coffee, An interdepartmental meeting was held at&apos; the Treasury, at which the Treasury pressed strongly for this Ministry&apos;s agreement to the export; el: 12,000 tons of coffee to Sweden out of the Prize Court stock. In view of the uncertain future of. colfee, the Department was,unable to concur.Dried Fmits. The Dried Fruits programme for the ensuing 12 months was considered at this vveeFs meeting of the Programme Committee. The original demand of the Supply Division was for tonnage and iinance for 110,000 tons. The Committee cut this programme down to 78,000 tons, which is made up as follows : -Tons. - .Basra Dates   -     -     -     -  - -     -  30,000   (Requiring tonnage andfinance).Spain and Portugal (Figs and Raisins)    -    5,000   (Requiring tonnage only).America (Sultanas, Raisins and Evaporated 23,000 (Requiring tonnage and Fruits). i   finance).Greek Currants     -     -     -     -     -  15,000  (No provision was madefor tonnage or finance, the figure being the quantity which Captain Elliot estimated would reach this country in chance freight space, both Greek and British).South Africa (Raisins and Evaporated 5,000 (Requiring tonnage and Fruits). finance).The necessary action is being taken to ascertain whether the Ministry of Shipping, the Treasury, and the American Board will sanction the revised programme.Fish.-The herring fishing at Fraserburgh was exceedingly heavy on Saturday, June 29th, 337 trucks being loaded and despatched, and 77 from Peterhead. These large supplies following upon heavy consignments on the previous Thursday, caused a slump at Billingsgate, salesmen finding difficulty in disposing of some of the fish. The arrival of this traffic at the one depot, Broad Street, caused congestion which retarded deliveries; it is proposed to divide the traffic between the East and West Coast routes during the fishing season.Meat. Dry weather has caused rather larger supplies of live stock to come to market in several areas, and by July 15th, when the meat ration is to be increased, it is hoped to supply a larger proportion of home-grown meat throughout the country.Transport in this country is now taxed to its utmost in handling the quantities of meat which have to be distributed, and it is doubtful if any further increase in the ration, even if available, could be regularly and evenly distributed.The restriction as to the sale of beef sausages to registered customers only has been relaxed. General butchers may, therefore, from July 8, sell beef sausages to customers without coupons, irrespective of whether such customers are or are not registered customers.Dripping may, until further notice, be obtained without coupons. *Tea. The proposal to pay a rebate of a pound to primary wholesalers, on certain conditions, to enable tea to be delivered free to retailers, was considered at a meeting with the Sub-Committee of the Tea Control Committee.Organised Distribution.Rationing. The decision to relax the restrictions on changes of retailers and in particular to grant all applications to return to a retailer with whom the applicant dealt before the introduction of rationing, has been taken full advantage of by the public in certain districts. Co-operative societies have been particularly active in urging those of their members, who have registered elsewhere to return to: them.Represeniations have been received from the Ministry of National Service that German, prisoners engaged on heavy agriculture work need a larger ration. It has been decided that the increased allowance shall be taken in the form of unrationed food to be purchased either by the prisoners at the camp canteen or by the farmer who boards them.

Adams, Brixton, was sentenced to six weeks&apos; imprisonment in the second division under the Sugar Rationing Order. The defendant had not only obtained duplicate sugar tickets, registered at different shops, but had also obtained a sugar rationing paper from the Registration Clearing House. The defendant&apos;s application to be allowed to pay a fine was refused.PART II-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.From the Tables and more detailed account which follow it will be seen that: (1) The decline in cereal imports which manifested itself in the middle of June, still continues. While this in part, at any rate, was anticipated, heavier arrivals during the latter part of July and August must be realised if the stocks at the close of the cereal year are to be fully satisfactory.Supplementary Rationing. At a conference with the railway executive it was agreed to increase the special meat allowance to trainmen doing lodging turns, to reduce the jam and tea allowances, and to make cheese an alternative to meat only when available.District Reports. General satisfaction is expressed by the Commissioners at the concession allowed of a consignment of sugar placed at their disposal for allocation to private fruit growers. They express the hope that it will facilitate a considerable amount of fruit being preserved, which would otherwise have been wasted. The Commissioner for the North Midlands says that the most effective means of using such fruit appears to him to be by establishing jam kitchens, and that this is being done at Spalding and Peterborough, and that a vigorous campaign for bottling and drying fruits is also now being carried on in his division.-Reports in connection with milk are now generally satisfactory, with the exception of that from the North Western Division, where a serious strike has occurred at Oldham, causing depletion of the milk supply to 250,000 persons. The Commissioner reports, further, that strikes are threatened in five large districts in Lancashire ; any attempt made by the Food Control Committees to lower the retail price (which is, he says, in many cases too high) causing trouble.Enforcement of Orders.There are 82 less prosecutions this week than last.&quot; The total is 979, and the number of convictions 934. The percentage of convictions, 94, is the highest since the week ending the 30th April.Seven of the English Divisions record 100 per cent, of convictions, and only one Division (South Midland) had less than 90 per cent, of convictions. The West of Scotland Division, with 99 per cent, for 126 prosecutions, gives, perhaps, the most striking figure in the return, their number of prosecutions having hitherto been almost invariably below 50.The Division sending in the largest number of cases is the Home Counties, with 181; percentage of convictions, 90.Prosecutions were instituted under 66 Orders, of which the principal were : Cases.
(2) Notwithstanding the decrease just noticed, the present position of stocks is good. The wheat stock is high as compared with that held on July 1st in last year, and the same is true of many other articles. The growth of substantial reserves in butter, bacon and lard deserves mention. On the other hand the fall in the stock of cocoa is serious.(3) Signs of an increase in the supply of home-fed meat are evident. There is a probability, however, that the home live stock will not be seriously, encroached upon for some weeks.Imports.For the week ending July Gth imports showed a serious decline (Table A). The total, 114,900 tons, was 47,500 tons below last week&apos;s moderate total, and the smallest since the week ending March 30th, when exceptionally small arrivals of cereals brought down the aggregate below the level of surrounding weeks. In the week under review nearly all the principal foods registered falls. Wheat and flour in equivalent wheat totalled 65,400 tons, a decrease of 16,400 tons on the week before ; for the week ending July 7th, 1917, the total was 204,500 tons. Mainly owing to increased arrivals of rice the aggregate of other cereals was- 4,600 tons higher on the week, but was less than half the total of a year ago.Beef, mutton, and meat uuenumerated were each lower ; taken together they totalled 12,000 tons, against 20,300 tons in the previous week. Bacon and hams declined from 11,500 tons to 8,100 tons, the smallest import received in any week for several months.Widespread as was the fall in imports, it was gravest in sugar/the total being only 5,900 tons against 29,700 tons in the previous week and 35,100 tons in the corresponding week of 1917. Not since the week ending October 27th last has such a small quantity of sugar been received. Imports for 1918 to date are now less than during the corresponding period of 1917.Receipts of butter, though larger than in the previous week, were less than the average for the year.   Cheese at 3,000 tons was 600 tons down on the week.Consumption.Meat. The total quantity of meat, home and foreign, at the four principal markets included in Table B. was 5 per cent, less in the week ending June 29th than in the week before, and 15 per cent, less than in the corresponding week of last year. Imported supplies fell 13 per cent., but were 38 per cent, higher than a year ago. For the first time for several weeks home-fed supplies showed an increase on the week before; the increase amounted to 36 per cent., but in. tons was only half the decrease in foreign meat.For the week ending July 6th there was again an increase in the supply of beef and mutton in the Central London Markets. Foreign supplies remain unchanged. Taking both kinds together, the increase on the previous week was 3 per cent.; compared with the year before, there was a decrease of 17 per cent.Live stock supplies at the markets (Table C.) for the week ending June 29th showed an increase as regards both cattle and sheep. For cattle the increase amounted to 10 per cent, and for sheep to 25 per cent.Fish. Supplies of fish at Billingsgate Market for the week ending June 29th were 1,812 tons against 1,787 tons in the previous week. In the corresponding week of 1917 the total was 2,695 tons.Milh The milk index has fallen for the past fortnight; in the week ending June 22nd II points and in the week ending June 29th another point. All the railways reported decreases.Stocks.Stocks on July 1st were in general at a satisfactory level. The anticipated fall in wheat stocks during June was avoided by larger importations, though the actual increase, 28,000 tons, was but slight as compared with 232,000 tons, that of last June; stocks are now 1,714,000 tons against 1,360,000 tons a year ago. Stocks of rice have again increased and are more than double those on July 1st, 1917. Other principal cereals have fallen and are lower than those of a year ago.A  6075-2 B
The increase in bacon and hams of 14,300 tons to 76,100 tons was expected.   A gratifying feature is the maintenance of meat stocks on the higli level of recent months.   With the exception of beef, all the meats scheduled were higher than a - month ago.An increase of 8,100 tons raised the stocks of butter to the highest figure reached since January 19.16. Margarine fell slightly; taking butter and margarine together stocks were practically the same as a year ago.Heavy arrivals of canned fish have caused stocks to rise to 28,900 tons, the highest ligure for any month since stocks were first collected 1.6 months ago.*Prices.Wholesale. The price of barley has risen from 57s. lOd. to 61s. 7d. per quarter, higher than it has been since August last.   A year ago it was 69s. 5d. per quarter.1 English cheddar cheese has fallen 4s. Qd. to 159s. Qd. per cwt.   The wholesale price&apos; of Government controlled butter has been reduced from 252s. per cwt. to 233s. 4dL per cwt.Retail. Changes in retail prices during June were few (Table H). Milk rose 11 per cent, and eggs nearly 9 per cent. The rise in the price of eggs during the past year has been in all 78 per cent., more than double the percentage rise in any other of the principal foods. The only other movements of note were in butter and potatoes ; the price of the former fell 3 per cent, and that of the latter rose 3 per cent. Potatoes are 36 per cent, cheaper than on July 1st, 1917.
