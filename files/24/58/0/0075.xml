secret.(t!    document is ^-^^^t^^ V/His E$i&apos;iJi.;.i&apos;iMaiesty&apos;s cover nmenl)MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Report for Week ending Wednesday, July 17, 1918,PART I.-ACTION TAKEN.On Saturday, July 13, Mr. dynes received the Canadian editors now visiting this country, and, in the course of a brief statement on the food situation, expressed his gratitude for and appreciation of the great work which had heen done by Canada in the matter of food supplies.On Monday, July 15, Mr. Clynes was sworn in as Food Controller. He was returned unopposed for North-East Manchester on July 16, and took his seat in the House of Commons on the following day.On Monday afternoon, Mr. Prothero called upon Mr. Clynes and discussed the nature and extent of the control proper to be exercised over the wholesale milk trade in order to secure adequate supplies and equitable distribution during the winter months.The first meeting of the new Central Agricultural Advisory Council appointed by the Boards of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food was held at $ie Surveyors&apos; Institute yesterday when Mr. Prothero, as President of the Council, opened the proceedings. The Earl of Selborne, K.G., was.elected Chairman, with Captain Sir Charles Bathurst, M.P., and Dr. Douglas, as Vice-chairmen. Mr. R. S. Langford, of the Board of Agriculture, and Miss Powell, of the Ministry of Food, were appointed joint secretaries .to the Council. There was a large attendance of members repre-senting all the principal agricultural societies in the United Kingdom. The chief question under consideration Avas grain prices for the 1918 crop, and it was arranged that a deputation should lay the views of the Council before the Home Cereals Committee.In the House of&apos;Lords, on July 17, Lord Crawford stated that it was only intended to fix prices for those few varieties of plums of which there is a substantial crop, and which are suitable for manufacture into jam.Mr. Sydney Walton, C.B.E., and Mr. H. S. Syrett have been appointed Private Secretaries to the Food Controller.Control of Supplies.Allied Requirements.-Cables have been exchanged with New York in reference to the British, Italian, and Belgian military requirements for corned and boiled beef for July, August, and September. No progress has been made with these orders even for July, and the position has again become acute owing to the United States Quarter-master^ Department having commandeered packers&apos; total output to 31st December. A special conference with the United States Food Administration has just been held, and representations have been made to them as to the absolute necessity of these military supplies. The United States Food Administration are now conferring with their Quartermasters Department and with the Allied Provisions Export Commission, and according to the latest cables it is hoped to obtain these supplies on a sharing basis as in April last.Bacon, Earns and Lard. The representative London and Liverpool importers who attended the meeting of the Bacon Board on the 16th July, unanimously recommended that bacon and hams should be sold without coupons. The reasons for the recommendation were that the imported bacon was arriving in poor condition and being placed in store in this unsatisfactory condition was steadily deteriorating. Moreover, the rate of consumption has not been quite so high as was anticipated.The proposal is under consideration. It is anticipated that if it is adopted the stocks at the end of the year will still be sufficient.The Claims Committees in London and Liverpool have been enlarged to include representatives of the wholesale trade.A  (33)6075-3  Pkl   135  7/18  e k s A
Butter. During the week ending 13th July, 1,005 tons of butter arrived from the Argentine; on 1.5tli J uly the stocks in hand were 22,300 tons, and the quantity on passage 1,070 tons.In accordance with arrangements made with the United States Food Achninistra-tion no butter is being bought in the United States at present, but 8,000 tons are definitely assured to us between May and October 1918, and it is hoped to recommence shipping in September. The United States Food Administration intend, if necessary, to,requisition butter to&apos; fulfil our requirements and those of the United Stales Army and Navy. Owing to the traders&apos; stocks being very low, no considerable purchases of butter have been made in Canada since 22nd of June, and the market is 1 cent clearer; it is expected to resume purchases shortly. It has now been definitely ascertained that sufficient refrigerated tonnage will be available to tranship during the next few months the hulk of our purchases of butter now in store in Australasia. The principal source of the supply of butter at the present time is Ireland, the quantity received during the week ending July 13th being approximately 1,300 tons.Canadian Supplies. Important conferences have been held between Mr. Clynes and the Canadian Ministers of the Interior, Immigration, and Naval Affairs, regarding purchases of foodstuffs in Canada and the general food situation. Mr. Clynes has conveyed to Sir Robert Borclen a cordial invitation for a member of the Canadian Government to attend the conferences which the Food Controllers of Great Britain, France, and Italy will hold with Mr. Hoover during the coming week.Cereals. The Select Committee on National Expenditure are reconsidering the expenditure involved by the Bread Subsidy, on which they commented in their Third Report. On Wednesday, July 17th, they heard the evidence of Sir John Beale, Mr. W. H. Peat, Mr. II. F. Paul, and Mr. C. F. Spencer.It has been found possible to effect a further improvement in the quality of bread. Hitherto when imported flour was blended in Government Regulation flour, millers were required to obtain one per cent, additional extraction from the wheat milled for each 10 per cent, of imported flour used. In view of the increased stocks of imported flour millers in England and Scotland may now blend up to 30 per cent, of imported flour without the addition of further offals. In Ireland, owing to smaller stocks, the maximum of imported flour so used is 20 per cent. At the same time the quantity of imported flour distributed to bakers has considerably increased.Clieese. An amended schedule to the Bi^itish Cheese Order, 1917, has been issued, making alterations in the maximum first-hand prices of certain cheeses.The Caerphilly Cheese (Eeqiiisition) Order, 1918, dated 13th July, 1918, requires all persons, who manufacture such cheese in Great Britain, to place it at the disposal of the Food Controller on and after 29th July, and to deal with it as the Food Controller may prescribe.Coeoa. The Supply Division has asked for shipment of 7,000 tons of raw cocoa per month, commencing next October. It is desired to obtain raw cocoa in the following proportions :  5.750 tons per month from British West Africa ;1,000 tons per month from the British West Indies ; and250 tons per month from Ceylon.Dried Fruits. Shipment of 4.000 tons of currants has been reported from Greece. 1,600 tons, the balance of this Ministry&apos;s purchase, is being lifted by troopship, and 2,400 tons has been lifted by a Greek vessel under this Ministry&apos;s new scheme of taking over all arrivals of dried fruits. Both vessels left Greece under escort on July 13th.Arrangements have been made with the Greek Government whereby this Ministry, subject to certain safeguards, assumes the insurance of all currants shipped from Greece to the United Kingdom, charging 10 per cent, on the c.i.f. price.Dried Vegetables. It has been arranged that the whole of the plants which are suitable for drying mixed vegetables only are to be shut clown, and that the remaining plants should he taken over for the time being into the Potato Preserving Scheme to produce sliced and dried potatoes. The experimental treatment of sliced and dried potatoes at Victoria Park has been producing lately more satisfactory results.Game. The Petrol Control Department has decided that there can be no alteration of the law with regard to the supply or use of petrol for cars for the purpose of carrying shooting parties.
Margarine. In consequence of the rise in the price of raw materials, and also the necessity of supplying a better grade of margarine during the hot weather, thereby entailing additional cost, it has been decided by the Food Controller that the price of margarine to the consumer shall be raised from Is. to Is. 2d. from the 22nd July. Certain small adjustments have also been made in the allowanco^e to the wholesalers and retailers distributing margarine.Meat. The heavy rains of last week have yet had no appreciable effect upon the quantities of live stock coming to the market, although doubtless this will soon diminish ; at present there is a very fair supply of home-grown meat, especially of mutton ; there has been a corresponding diminution in the demand for frozen meat. It is possible , that this will increase after this week when the meat ration is increased, but on the other hand the people have become so accustomed to the limited supply of meat that they may not purchase the whole of the increased ration which they are now permitted to buy, especially as they are still able to secure ample supplies of bacon, and sausages and offal are free of the coupon.There is no improvement in the condition of the cargoes of meat arriving from North America, and the Hon. Algernon Borthwick has now left this country to investigate the conditions under which the meat is shipped.The repeated complaints of retail butchers as to the payment of uniform price for meat of good and bad quality alike have made it necessary as from next week to reduce the price of Canadian meat by Id. per lb., of Brazilian and South African meat by \d. per lb., and of meat from the United States by \d. per lb. These reductions are regarded by retailers as in the nature of an insurance premium against possible loss arising from the waste involved in trimming meat of inferior quality or in poor condition ; it is intended that this concession shall relieve the Ministry of Food from all claims on this account, except in respect of meat condemned within 24 hours after delivery to the butcher.The Meat Retail Prices (Scotland) Order, 1918, will come into operation on July 21st, 1918, and will.fix a uniform Schedule of Maximum Retail Prices for meat applicable throughout Scotland. Hitherto retail meat prices in Scotland have been fixed by Local Food Committees, whereas in England and Wales a uniform scale has been in operation for some months. In view of the fact that local variations in prices in Scotland gave different values to the meat coupon in different areas it was felt desirable to prescribe a uniform scale for the whole country. The Schedule fixes the prices for the various joints of meat, for three classes of beef sausages and two classes of pork sausages.Milk. There is a shortage of milk in some areas, especially along the South Coast, and difficulty is being experienced in providing the necessary supplies, pending the control of the wholesale distribution of milk.Poultry. The Poultry (Prices) Order has been completed, with some additions relating to the price of game, and now awaits signature.Sugar for Jam.-It has been decided to cancel all permits issued to private fruit-growers under the Sugar (Domestic Preserving) Order, 1918, which have not been used by the holders by Saturday, August 17. Supplies of sugar in the possession of retailers in respect of the permits so cancelled will be held at the disposal of the Food Control Committee for reallocation to private fruit-growers, whose fruit may be wasted if sugar is not made available for its preservation.Tea. The new scheme of distribution based on the registration of consumers and indents on wholesalers came into effect as from the 14th July. No serious shortages have been reported. A small extra quantity was distributed for the first four-weekly period to obviate the risk of shortage, but any surplus so distributed will be carried forward to the second period.Organised Distribution.Local Administration. It has been decided by the Ministry to extend to the 9th of November next the term of office of those members of Food Control Committees whose term of office would otherwise expire before that date, and to determine on that date the term of office of all members, so that all. will go out of office at the same time.Food Supplies.-A form of licence for Red Cross Sales and Sales by Civil Organisations with full instructions has been issued to Food Commissioners.
The licence gives exemption from Orders relating to prices, and leaves discretion to Food Commissioners to allow the sale of rationed foods without production of coupons, on condition that consumers of foods so purchased act in the same way as if they had purchased direct from actual producers, i.e., they must not exceed the ration allowance, and must cancel their coupons at home.Supplementary Rationing. Special arrangements for the rationing of seamen ashore have been sanctioned. Merchant Seamen on Monthly Articles will, on dis-charge, receive for a fortnight the scale allowance to soldiers on leave from the front, and thereafter will drop to the &quot; civilian scale ; Seamen on Weekly Articles will receive Supplementary rations for a fortnight, and will thereafter drop to the civilian scale.District Reports.Northern Division. There are now two centres---at Newcastle and at Durham City, to which surplus supplies of fresh farm butter from rural areas are sent each week. It is reported that the scheme is working well, and that no difficulty is experienced in disposing of the butter received at those depots. Speaking generally, food distribu-tion is working satisfactorily throughout the division, and special arrangements are being made to supply Admiralty shipyard hostels. The Food Committees have also dealt with the question of adequate supplies to meet the needs of soldiers and women Avorkers on the land.N.E. Division. The crops on the whole promise well, and the yield should be above the average. Oats will, however, be a poor crop, especially when sown on newly ploughed land, wireworms having done a great deal of damage.Contentment prevails generally among the working classes, the only real complaint being the high cost of vegetables.Home Counties Division. The reports as to the general condition of the corn crops are good in Kent, Surrey, and Hertfordshire. Inspection of food offices in the munition area of N.W. Kent has shown a remarkable absence of complaint. Progress has also been made with local schemes of retail co-operation.North Wales Division. Harvest prospects all round are good. The corn crop, it is said, will exceed that of last year, and the potato crop promises to be the best for some years.Scotland, North Division. The general reports on the crops are favourable. Oats and wheat promise very well. The potato crop, which has been considerably increased, is believed to be first rate. The turnip crop is, however, said to be poor in some districts, and on the whole disappointing.Sheep and lambs are reported throughout the division to be in good condition.Enforcement of Orders.The total number of prosecutions for the week is 780, of which number 715 resulted in convictions. There were .199 less prosecutions than in the previous week, hut the two Welsh Divisions sent in more than their average number of cases.  -The following Divisions sent in the largest number of cases : 	Division.

In each case there had been failure to comply with the regulation that the total quantity of butter and margarine used should not be more than half of the fats authorised. The Carlton was fined 2101 and the Travellers 1051. with 10 guineas costs in each case.

Arrivals should continue good, though fluctuation in individual weeks is, of course, to be expected.Receipts of butter and lard were the lowest for many weeks. The butter figure, 273 tons, is the smallest for six months. Cheese improved on the week before, but is 1,000 tons less than in the corresponding week of 1917.Imports of oilseeds, nuts and kernels during June showed a great improvement on those of May and on those of a year ago. Total arrivals in the first half of this year were 29,800 tons more than in the first half of 1917. Against this has to be set the practical cessation of imports of oilseed cake, which iu the first six months of last year totalled nearly 120,000 tons.Consumption.Meat-An upward tendency in home-fed supplies is again noticeable. For the week ended July 6th the number of fat cattle stored at markets in Great Britain (Table C) was 29 per cent, higher, and the number of fat sheep 4 per cent, higher than in the previous week. The continued dry weather and the consequent loss of pasturage has led to the number of stock coming forward for slaughter being some-what greater than anticipated.The increase in the number of animals at the markets has been reflected in the supplies of home-fed meat at London, Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool (Table B). The increase in such supplies of 27 per cent, in - the week ended July 6th followed on an increase of 36 per cent, in the previous week. Concurrently. the quantity of foreign meat on sale has diminished.Taking home and foreign meat together, total supplies * fell 4 per cent, on the week. As compared with the week ended July 7th, 1917, the aggregate was 14 per cent, lower, and home-fed meat 51 per cent, lower, while imported meat was 27 per cent, higher.A similar movement iD supplies is observable in the Smithfield Report for the week ended July 13th.    Home-killed beef and mutton totalled 735 tons againstA 6075-3 bPART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Increases in sugar and bacon and hams brought up the aggregate importation of the principal foods for the week ending July 13th to a figure 23,100 tons higher than that in the previous week (Table A). The total, 138,000 tons, however, compares unfavourably with 309,300 tons, the total of a year ago.Cereals, butchers&apos; meat, fats, were all. lower than in the week before. The quantity of wheat and flour received was, in grain, but 52,000 tons, less than one-fifth the import during the week July.7th-l.4th, 1917, and little more than sufficient to meet half a week&apos;s current consumption. Poor arrivals of barley, oats, and maize, caused the total of other cereals to sink below that of last week; as compared with a normal pre-war import the falling off was more than 70 per cent. The progressive decline during the past four weeks is shown in tabular form below.After several weeks of comparatively low imports, bacon and hams rose to 18,800 tons. Other meats were unsatisfactory: the total was the smallest for any week since April, and much below the average for the previous weeks of the year. A comparison of the past four weeks&apos; figures with last year is not unfavourable to 1918:-
483 tons in the week ended July Gth. A decline from 3,052 tons to 2,696 tons in imported supplies brought down the total for this class of meat 3 percent, below that of the previous week. Compared with a year ago, the aggregate was 12 per cent, lower, and home-fed supplies 58 per cent, lower.Provisions.-1:Returns from a large number of co-operative stores and multiple shops for the four weeks ended July 6th, 1918, lead to the index numbers shown in&apos; Table F. Sales of bacon and hams have fallen slightly, but are still considerably higher than in the corresponding period of 1917. For each of the other commodities shown sales are less than a year ago. Compared with the preceding four weeks the consumption of both lard and butter has increased ; that of the former by more than 55 per cent.; that of the latter by nearly 12 per cent.; in each case consumption is higher than since October last. Last month&apos;s movements in cheese and eggs have continued; sales of cheese have increased, sales of eggs have decreased.The actual weights sold, included in the returns, are given in the following table: Provisions.

The total was, however, nearly 33 per cent.-less than that for the week ending July 14th, 1917.Milk. The milk index! has fallen to 107-1 (Table-F). The decrease in the supply of milk is partly seasonal, but in part&quot; is to be attributed to the hot weather and lack of rain1 reducing the milk-feeding qualities of the grass.
