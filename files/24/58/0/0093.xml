/(ggI3 POCUliBBT IS TKS EROPBBTlf OF ET3 BRIMBjHj MAJ23!ff&apos;3 GOVERHHSHI).Lord $ortheliffe has forward set... the attached document for the consideration of the War Cabinet,   Ee suggests that this very remarkable document should be read aloud to all the Members of the War Cabinet.   Ee states that it is the work of Major Stanley Washburn, one of the acutest American brains engaged in the War.    Major Washburn has, he states, been in the &apos;:7ar almost continuously since 1914, except for the period when he was with Senator Roots&apos; Mission to Russia.   If he can obtain authority to distribute propaganda by aeroplane, lord florthcliffe proposes to set up an organisation in Paris or in London to do what Major Washburn suggests, endeavouring to get General Pershing to oooperate.It will be remembered that lord Weir, ?/ho is now in  ranee, has undertaken to go into the question of distributing propaganda leaflets by aeroplane, and a copy of this document ie being forwarded to him.   I am also suggesting to the Secretary of State for War that a copy should be forwarded to the Pield ^larsha^ Commanding-in-Chief as his cooperation would be neees-Ihe Prime Minister has instructed me to raise tho question again on Lord Weir&apos;8 return.(Signed)  M.P.A. Eankey.      *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.\V. July 22, 1918.Mote by the Secretary.sary.
Confidential.   Memorandum &quot;by Major Stanley ^aahburn, CavalryReserre Corps, Headquarters 26th American Division.1* The nature of propaganda is somewhat analagous to thesubject of commercial advertising and its principles are0&apos;almost identical.   In regard to commercial advertising there are certain^ elemental conditions precedent without which it ie a waste of time and money to make arty efforts whatsoever^&apos; The first essential basis of advertising is that there must be a demand for the article advertised;   second that there must be ah audience that is open to conviction ae to merits, and third that the commodity advertised contains definite merit.These factorB being present the objective of the advertis-ing must be determined, second it must be continuous, third it j must be on a large scale, fourth, it must be interesting to read, fifth it must as far as may be diversified so as to reach the varying psychology of varying communities.   Thus general commer-cial advertising goes into innumerable types of magazines,   the ads being written to hit the special psychology of readers of a special type.11* Reducing the abo^se analogy to the concrete.   After havingbeen five weeks on two somewhat active American gegters and having had opportunities to examine numerous German prisoners, I am of the opinion that there is now a demand for propaganda over the German lines, inasmuch f*r there is now a growing question in the minds of the enemj first, as to the justice of their cause, second, their possibility of winning the war, third, what is to be their situation at home after the war.   The moment one finds the minds of the enemy asking questions it is of sound military polioy to be there with suitable replies.   I have now been studying German prisoners since October 1914 on three different fronts.   In this time I have discovered but two really shallow spots in their morale.    1st.   At tho end of 1915 when after six months constant fighting in Russia they found them -solves checked in the interior of Russia with winter coming on, We met this not unsuccessfully with propaganda of the hardships of the Russian winter, quoting Napoleons experience in 1812. Again late in 1916 when the Allies were attacking simultaneously on all fronts.   This was met by news bulletins announcing results on all fronts.   Leas successful because on too small a scale. There now exists the best opportunity for propaganda that I have yet seen because after four years there is no decision in sight and the question of victory etc is now doubtful in every German mind and the apprehension of another winter without a decision is uppermost in every soldier&apos;s mind.111* The subjects which can now be advanced profitably by usfall under two heads.   1st. Material which can be printed in bulk and is available for every part of the German line. 2nd. Material which is aimed at the special psychology of individualU i tfl xThe general subject matter coming under&apos;whe   first heae. of propaganda should show. 1st That after four years of war with the Germans at their zenith they hare not been able to get s decision against Prance and England with America still latent. Then show definitely without exaggeration the numbers of American troops now in Prance and available within the coming months and years. 2nd. A dispassionate and friendly explanation of *flxy the Americans are fighting/pointing out that the merits of the!case of the Germans are so bad that the bulk of the -15,000,000 Germans in America are against the German case and many are actually fighting against them. 3rd. Take up and minimize the failure of the submarine warfare, indicating .just how it has failed. 4th, Daily, or at least frequent news bulletins, minirnizi] German successes /
locally, describing their own loasea and^ makin^*le*Jr Amiwio***a growing strength and fighting capacity.    5th.   Dle^nJ*e,iott of causes of.war and German responsibility for, poison gas, bombing expeditions etc.  None of this In a venomous or vindictive atyie.   The merits of the oase require Americans merely to state dispassionately the facts of the case.   The truth pressed home oonoietently and persistently inevitably percolates even into the dullest mind.    6th.  The misery resulting at home by continuation of the war.  Sxcerpta from German and neutral preee as to such conditions at home. These accompanied by appeals to the German soldiers showing that their continuation in the war does not Increase their chances to win, but serves only to prolong the misery of their families at home and lessen the probability ot Germany being able to recuperate, financially or economically after the war.   Briefly the above heads cover the tough field of what I would term General German propaganda.The second group of propaganda is what I would term local propaganda merely.    This should be aimed at special units all along the front.   In every unit there is some cause of discontent if it can be ascertained from prisoners. Sometimes It is food, again it may be brutal officers. Frequently it is Bavarian ot Saxon troops that are being used at the expense of conserving Prussians,   Often it is special nationalities like the Poles or Alsatians that are being sacrificed to get them out of the way.   These and a dozen causes oreate discontent in speoial sections.    These oases should be handled with speoial propaganda by divisions opposite aimed at   the psychology of the troops affected.In all propaganda whatever I would print at the head some such caption as the following :This sheet when presented to any American outpost, sentinel or patrol will be accepted as a pass through the American lines and provide safe conduct to the rear where the B****r will receive kind treatment for duration of the war, after which he will be returned to his family as speedily as possible.Scale of propaganda proposed.    as soon as possible would begin on the entire front (from Channel to Switzerland dropping or in other ways distributing from one to ten million leaflets a day.    These should not be larger than 8 by 10 inches, should be printed on rod or coloured paper and released from aeroplanes in packages of from 5,000 to 10,000 each, the packages being broken in the air.  My observation has been that packages dropped in bulk at once get into the hands of officers and never reaoh the troops.    A million a day scattered daily all over the country cannot be kept away from the troops.    Every man who reads and is convinced can be relied upon to talk to lit offers . (This is general advertising estimate of a convinced purchaser).   It must be noted that advertising is cumulative and immediate results are rare. Advertising experts tell me that lt takes a million dollars to put a new brand of whisky or tobacco on the market and re-suits are not looked for for months *     The German propaganda has always followed patieatly and painstakingly these principles.   They worked their propaganda in Russia for three years, day in and day out. until the cumulative effect of the same was the collapse of Russia.Method of printing.   Ths general advertising which would run into the millions should be done on a large city cylindrical press.  The context should not run over 300 words in e&amp;eh.    These should be set by linotype machines with theheads *
heads hand set.   Probably from four to eight could be placed in eaoh form ) (corresponding to size of the daily paper printed), then matrixes made, oast and put on cylindrical presses and run out exactly as a daily paper.    The Matin Presses in Paris print 100,000 an hour of a six page paper. One hour on these presses so set and handled, would turn out from 3,000,000 to 0,000,000 sheets, thore bsing six prints on each page&quot;.    These are then put through a cutter and cut down to individual shoots.    This stuff can thus be turned out cheaply and in bulk and daily consignments sent out from Paris by motor lorries for distribution at division headquarters *   The printing of the special propaganda would be on a far smaller scale.   Probably not more than 20,000 copies of eacJh being required.    This can be done on aJrand press at each division, which should handle its local propaganda separately.VI. Method of circulation.    Aeroplanes or some devise that will shoot packages over the line from one to five miles and release at least 1,000 feet above ground to give margin of distribution widely.VII. Personnel of organisation.    Should be under the Intelligence Department of the Army working   with a link with Creels Bureau of Information at Washington &quot;deft he considered as a distinct military function and not as a part of the civilian propaganda that that organisation is now doing in Europe. There should be attached to one or more men (such as Frederick W. wile of the Daily Mail)who under-stands the psychology in detail of the enemy, both as a whole and in view to special localities.    Others who could travel about examining prisoners not strictly for military infoma-tion which is always better done by military man but searching their minds for the speoial psychology of conditions at aome and in their unite.   Material Of this sort frequently  reeaes up in the presence of a uniform.   Personally I have got more information easier as a correspondent than as an officer for the reason that men give up to a civilian certain details whioh one has to extract only after great effort if one isin uniform.   In addition I would recommend an American advertising expert to check scientifically the general methods used from the point of view of scientific advertising.III. As a general oonsideration all propaganda must be true,no promises made or allurements held out which cannot be absolutely guaranteed.   Por instance, all divisions should be instructed that any enemy surrendering and handing in the sheets will be taken immediately to the rear as agreed.IX. This whole programme should be inter-allied and animmediate appropriation of not less than ,55,000,000 each be provided to carry out the seme .Above merely a rough outline. Respectfully submitted,(sd)    Stanley Washburn,Major. C.R.C, H.Q.S.,26th Division.
