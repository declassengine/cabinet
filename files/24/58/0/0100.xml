Political Intelligence Department, C0I1PIDSUTIAL. Foreign Office,July 10th, 1918, &apos; ijpain /004.01h ::o h a !i h uon .TO HE?7 SPAjJSR LAr.&apos; ABOUT S3^I0E4nK A 3D THH Kg3S.The Spanish Government has just passed what is called an Espionage Bill through Parliament,     It aroused great opposition in the Press and among the Republican Left in the Chamber, hut the Ministers pressed it with great urgency andjit went through with little delay and no alteration and is now the law of the land.     The Deputies of the Extreme Left left the Chamber before the Bill was put to the vote and declare that they will carry on their agitation in the country and will not return to their places in Parliament so long as the present Ministry remains in office. Their object is said to be to expose the hollowness of the Liberalism of the Liberals who support the Coalition Government, and if possible corn-pel them to withdraw their support.    Already Alhucemas and Alba, both members of the present Cabinet, are reports d to have stated that they must consider their position in view of the new situation.     But probably nothing will come of this.It may be woirth while to aslc what lec1 to the introduction of the Bill and rfoat results may be expected to follow from its adoption.    And first a word as to its provisions.The preamble declares that the Covernraent has of late had increasing difficulty in maintaining the neutrality of Spain which is more and more threatened by campaigns which however resepotable in intention produce lamentable results.     It is neoessary that both natives and foreigners resident in Spain should be made to respeot this neutrality, and it has become clear that the Penal Code is not strong enough for this purpose. The Bill, therefore, forbids, under severe penalties, (1) &quot;the furnishing to a foreign Power of its agents information relating to the neutrality of Snain or of a nature to injure any other foreign Power.&quot;
(2)   The pulication or circulation of any news v/hich the Government has prohibited as &quot;contrary to the respect due to the neutrality or security of Snain&quot;;   or the &quot;spreading of news of a nature to alarm of seriously disqui^S Spaniards&quot;.(3) The &quot;outraging or holding uo to hatred or contempt the Chief of i Foreign State, or a Nation, Army or diplomatic representative, either by word of mouth or &quot;by print or picture&quot;.The Bill, now an Act, proceeds to give pewer to the Government to establish a censorship of all printed matter or: pictures nwhich oontain news, criticisms or works of any character bearing directly or indirectly inon the war&quot;.     The Censorship will have power to sequestrate the offend: Ing matter &quot;even though no judicial proceedings have   been taken&quot;.It is obvious that these powers are ef the most sweeping character and cauld be made to ctver the prohibition of the publication of all news of the war and of any oomment upon it,&apos;however moderate and reasonable, mat has driven the Government to ask f*r and to insist upon obtaining possession of such a drastic weapon?It is not possible to do m*re than guess wht called for the Bill.    The)abinet appears to have been.unanimous as to its urgent necessity.   Notmly the Prime Minister, who has been suspected of something like pfcO-Jermanism and of a love of authoritarian methods of Government, but theForeign Secretary, Dato and the pro-Ally pro-Ally/ Minister of Justice, Romanones, who will be primarily respoaei-ble for administering it and who is a Liberal and is accused by Conser-ratives of coquetting with the Left, insisted that it was impossible to(0 en any longer without it.   Romanenes added that if the Deputies knewthe motives which compelled the Cabinet to introduce the Bill they wouldigree.     On the other hand the attacks on it came from both sides.   The?ress was naturally enough nearly unanimous in protesting against beingjut into such a very tisyht strait-waistcoat.     The Deputies of the Iistreme Left opposed the Bill violently, and issued a manifesto declar-Ing it unconstitutional and certain to&quot;injure the.nations who in the present war represent the cause of eivilisatien and justice&quot;.   They say
-a-Jeffeot, that while pretending t* prevent espionage it will, in fact,I&apos;Lder it easier by punishing those who denounce espionage in the Press.their newsoapers attack the Billas a &apos;frankly pro-Bosche Bill&apos; and 1heirk of Prince Ratibor, the German Ambassador.    And it is reported that king its passage through the Chamber the dinlomatic Box was filled with Jrmaii and Austrian Secretaries whose presence gave rise to unfavourable [lament in the course of the debate.    On the/other hand two of the ifour Iputies who opposed the Bill were the notorious pro-German ex-Ministers Irrell and Aloala 2amora, the aatter of whom is legal adviser to the IrmanEmbassy.    They declared that it might have been used to prevent the fernings of the Neutral&apos; press whioh had saved Spain from being dragged Ito the war by the friends of the Allies.&apos;    Moreover it is obvious that f the Bill is fairly administered it is the Germans and not we who have ist to fear from its anti-Espionage Clauses.The truth is, probably, that its introduction by a Government not un-illlng to extend its powers over public ooinion is, in fact, due to some ressure from both sides.    The Allies have again and again made complaints f the abominable espionage which facilitates the work of Gorman submarines nfl honeycombs Spaaish commercial and industrial life:   they have pretes-ed against the publication of sailings of  ships which obviously exposes hem to danger:   and they have also had occasion to draw the attention of he authorities to such outrageous slanders as that the August strikes ere organised by Mr. AsQuitJj and M. albert Thomas through the British rnbassador with the object of establishing a- Spanish Republic with Count lomanones as its President.&apos;    Ho re effective, in the same direction, irobafrly, has been Prince Ratibor&apos;s -wrath at the Press revelations which iave led to the arrest ef a Spanish&quot;naval officer, and of a high police ffioial at Barcelona, for giving information about ships to German sub-iarines.    A free press is nowhere an institution regarded by Germans 1th friendly eyes.    And there may have been contributing private causes n the minds of the Ministers themselves;   such for example as Count omanones&apos; reported nervousness about assassination which may have led
-4-which feave been constantly directed against him.But whatever the motives which led to the Bill what will its results be?    And does it call for any particular action on the oart of the Allies.The results will wholly depend on the way on which it is-admini.?rterexU If it is administered so as to repress crime and not to- interfere with the fair expression of reasonable opinion, it will benefit rather   than in-jure us.   Duto has given a public assurance that it will not be used to prevent the expression of sympathies with one side or the other in the war, but only insult and abuse.     And it is to our advantage that it has al-ready led to the issue of an order orohibiting the publication of all news relating to the movements of ships.     So far so good.     But on the other hand, the usefulness of laws depends in Spain, even more than in other countries, on the loyalty, honesty and efficiency of those who should carry them out.     The danger is that the bulk of the official class, both civil and military , is tainted with oro-Oermanismand capable of making the best intentioned law a dead letter, or even a weapon, not against evil doers, but against those who expose them.     It is known that some of our Allies who have intimate and official knowledge of Spain take a grave view of these possibilities.   After all it was the Press who forced open the eyes of the Spanish Government to the infamous doing of Bravo Fortillo, the Barcelona Police Commissioner.     If such action on the part of the Press were to he stooped by pro-German officials under the powers of the new law, would not German espionage and anti-Allied machinations gain much more than they lose by its enactment?    Moreover the cause of the Allies invites discussion and has everything to gain by tt.     If an un-friendly noliee or magistracy interprets all criticism of German crimes as insults to the German nation,&apos; and forbids all publication of German fefeats as liable to occasion &quot;disquiet to Spaniards&quot;, the greatest in-jury may be done to the cause of the Ulies,
2.95ENDProbably tho Cabinet will wish to use its new Dowers cautiously,   And if the military situation imofcoves it will be increasingly inclined to project Spain and tV.e Allies against Herman intrigues and outrages which have just culminated in the torpedoing of a ship which had the Spanish Minister to Greece on board, flew his flag and had notified his presence to the German authorities.   But in any case the Allied Governments will have to watch the administration of the new lav/ very closely and insist In the most resolute manner that it is not twisted by pro-German offi-jlals into a means of muzzling the pro-Ally press and of concealing the machinations of German agents.    We have nothing to fear from the re-pression of crime but everything to lose by the silencing of public ooinion.i
