MUNITIONS AND THE LIMITS OF RECRUITING.I MUST direct the attention of the War Cabinet to the very serious consequences that will arise from the continual drafting of skilled men into the army from the munitions industries.Since the beginning of this year we have released no fewer than 100,000 men, nearly all of whom are skilled men, for military service. We have been deprived of all the Grade I men of 19 and 20 without excepting even draughtsmen, men employed in making gauges, breech mechanisms, optical instruments, and vital pivotal men.It is anticipated inter alia that the withdrawal of these men will reduce the output of iron ore. In the Cleveland iron-ore mines alone the consequent loss of iron ore is estimated at 6,000 tons a week ; the number of youths affected is only 250, but they are practically all underground drivers, a class of young lit men who can only be replaced by young miners working at the face. It is estimated that the Cumberland hematite mines will lose between 250 and 300 youths, with a consequent reduction in output of some 2,000 tons of ore per week. Blast furnaces and steel works will also be seriously affected, for it is considered.probable that not only will it be impossible to start the new extensions which have been constructed during the past years, but that, in addition, it may be necessary in some cases actually to shut down blast furnaces at present in operation and to close some of the existing steel mills.Hitherto J have done everything in my power to support the policy of the War Office and the Ministry of National Service. But I consider the time has now come when that policy requires to be the subject of a general reconsideration. Last autumn it was obvious that Russia would be out before America could come in, and that consequently the most strenuous efforts should be made to enable our Army to meet the attacks which would come upon it in the spring. The disasters of the spring rendered it still more imperative to provide men to carry us through the summer. I consider, therefore, we were right to run very great risks in all other directions in order to maintain the fighting front.We have now to take into consideration a period where the conditions are entirely different from those of last autumn and this spring. The immediate crisis is not over, and, indeed, the worst may have yet to come. But men taken from industry after July will not reach the battle-front in time to influence the decision. So far as man-power is concerned, the die is cast. Secondly, the Americans, who have Jen million men between 20 and 30 on whom to draw, are now arriving in great numbers, more than 270,000 having disembarked in a single month. The main contribution to our manhood next year must be derived from them. If we are to obtain any effective superiority in numbers, it can only be by American aid. No contribution that we can make can substantially alter the situation in a numerical sense. The question for us, therefore, is how to use the last remains of our man-power so as to develop the greatest possible military effort. This will not necessarily be by making the largest possible number of infantry soldiers.Since the subject was last considered, the American forces in Europe have risen to 1,000,000 men. It is stated that more than 2,000,000 Americans have already been enlisted, that 3,000,000 will have been enlisted by the 1st September, and that the War Department is preparing clothing i for 4,000,000 as from the 1st January. It is evident that the solution of the man-power problem lies in the speedy transportation to France of these great numbers, their training and organisation on the battle-front, and, lastly, their equipment and supply. The first 1,000,000 who have come have been almost entirely equipped by Britain and France. But for the fact that we were able to supply therri with artillery, machine-guns, rifles, trench mortars, &amp;c, and to feed them with munitions of all kinds, no use in the present crisis could have been made of this first million. My latest report from America states that the American army in France will be almost entirely dependent
daring the whole of 1918 on British and French artillery production. If we are &apos;to continue to put, as we must do, the most extreme pressure upon the American Govern-ment to pour i&apos;ts men over, we must be in a position to guarantee them thorough and immediate equipment when they arrive, and ample supply thereafter.The limiting factors are perpetually changing. During the rest of .1918 and the first half of 1919 the limiting factor on the employment of American troops will not be men or tonnage or food, but equipment of all kinds. For the time being the American munitions programme, particularly in guns and aeroplanes, is woefully behind their available resources in man-power. Unless we and the French are able to supplement promptly every deficiency in the American munitions programme, the despatch of very large numbers of their troops may be retarded from this cause. On the one hand, there are available in America enormous numbers of men in the prime of life ; on the other, in Great Britain, for the sake of getting comparatively small numbers of men of inferior physique who will not be much use, or of superior skill who cannot be spared, we run the risk of endangering production of munitions on which not only our own Armies, but the rapid importation of American troops, depend. The situation has, in fact, undergone a very marked change, and we shall commit another of the great mistakes of the war if we do not adapt our policy to it in time.When the Army Council are warned, as they have been for some time warned, that we are now reaching the limits of releases of man-power from munitions which can be made without endangering output, and vital output, they are accustomed to reply that they would rather have men than munitions; but at the same time they continually put forward to us, and endorse, the Commander-in-Chiefs requests for new and large increases in the supply of munitions, and great disasters occur at the front which expose us to enormous and unforeseen demands. For instance, we have had in the last few months strenuous demands to increase the range of the artillery, which can only be done by a very considerable programme of rearmament; very large increases of small arms ammunition have been demanded,; largely increased supplies of breech mechanisms; a large increase in the supply of tanks; great extensions of our poison gas plant.American necessities will come on top of all these, and France may at any moment be unable to assist us in meeting them. Already 1 have had fromJVI. Loueheur demands for 6-inch howitzers for the Americans beyond anything that I am able to supply, and a large proportion of the American divisions are not yet provided with artillery.Then come the immense demands of the Air Force. The aeroplame engine programme has in the last two months fallen off very seriously indeed, and the extremely good situation which I was able to report to the Cabinet at the beginning of the year no longer holds good. Last week the production was only 688 against an estimate of 1,132. In one firm making crank shafts for an urgently needed type of aeroplane engine they have already lost seven out of eight highly skilled mechanics engaged on one essential stage of manufacture. The consequent loss of crank shafts involved a loss of twenty-five aeroplanes per week.The case of Messrs. Barr and Stroud is another illustration of the wastefulness of recruiting skilled men. They are about to produce a new anti-aircraft height finder, the merit of which is that it is far more efficient, and also requires a smaller personnel to use it. The withdrawal of some thirty skilled mechanics from this firm will mean the postponement for many months of the commencement of deliveries of an instrument which, if the men had been left at their work, would in a very few months have made possible the release of thirty men many times over from anti-aircraft batteries in the field.Most remarkable of all is the case of the tanks. A programme was approved, at a special meeting of the War Cabinet presided over in February by the Prime Minister, for the urgent construction of tanks. That programme represented what I then considered to be the maximum effort we could make in this field. It is rapidly falling into arrears. Meanwhile, however, the War Office, on the urgent demand of the army in the field, have demanded 400 additional tanks, and if the plans which are favoured by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff are to attain fruition, still larger increases will be required. In spite of all the opposition to tanks, and the mishandling of this policy at every stage, they have now taken a firm root, and&apos;: every week affords further evidence of their immense utility. I have now received a most urgent demand through M. Loucheur, from General Foch for 300 large tanks to be delivered to the French in July, August, and September. The only thing that has been done to assist me in this matter has been to take hundreds
men from the manufacture of tanks, thus dislocating the whole of the Metropolitan orks, with the result that for the sake of getting enough men to make a couple of companies of infantry, the equipment of perhaps four or five battalions of tanks will be lost. Considering that one tank is worth hundreds of men, and, properly used, may conceivably be worth a whole battalion, I must avow myself unable to comprehend the processes of thought which are at work.It seems to me evident that we are now going too far and over-shooting our mark in regard to man-power. Once the emergency of this summer has been surmounted, we ought not to rupture our munitions supply, particularly our supply of vital modern appliances, for the sake of adding 20,000 men more or less to our Army of over 3,00Q,000. We ought, on the contrary, to make sure that our great plants here are kept working at their fullest possible capacity in order that our own Army may be equipped with the most perfect, scientific, and life-saving weapons, and in order that we may be able to place in the field the largest possible number of Americans.I do not by this mean to imply that we shall not be able to find more men from the munitions industries. On the contrary, I earnestly hope to continue, though on a greatly reduced scale, a steady policy of releases which will aggregate many thousands by the end of the year ; but I now ask that - (a.) Pivotal and vital men of 19 and 20 who were called up at the end of Juneshall be returned at my discretion up to a number, not exceeding 1,500; (b.) That in regard to men of 21, 22, and 23 a clean cut should not be proceeded with; and(c.) That future releases of men from the munitions industries should take place as and when efficient substitutes are secured and trained.July 12, 1918.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.
