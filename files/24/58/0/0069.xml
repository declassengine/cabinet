(This Docwnsient is the Property of*Hisiesty&apos;s Government.)Confidential.LABOUR POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(17th July 1918.)I circulate the following notes, which, have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions, on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-DISPUTES.Strike Statistics for the Week ended the 10th July.The London aircraft strike caused a loss of 120,000 working days. Apart from this, the loss of time due to strikes on Ministry of Munitions work was only 14,180 days. The total time lost-134,180 days during the week represents about nine-tenths of 1 per cent, of possible working time.Embargoes.Trouble has arisen out of the plan for rationing labour by placing embargoes upon munitions firms against the employment of additional labour without a licence. In view of the grave shortage of certain kinds of skilled labour, firm adherence to the policy seems to be essential to the maintenance of an adequate output of munitions, but strong exception is being taken to its application, especially in the Manchester and the Birmingham areas. At Coventry, where embargoes have been laid upon four firms, and at Manchester, where embargoes have been laid upon sixteen firms, strikes are threatened and notices have been handed in. The representations of the men are that the scheme is an attempt to introduce &quot; the thin end of the wedge of industrial conscription,&quot; and that it deprives them of all the advantages which they gained by the abolition of leaving certificates. Steps are being taken to explain to them the true scope of the measure and the pressing necessity for it, and considera-tion is being given to the adoption of further measures should the need arise.Victimization.A recent feature of the situation in munition industries has been a substantial increase in the number of trade disputes reported under the head of &quot; alleged victimization.&quot; The disputes, happily, clo not develop with any alarming frequency into strikes, though a not inconsiderable number of strikes have originated from this cause. A psychological explanation is possibly to be found in reaction from the great wave of patriotic exaltation which suddenly swept through the workshops at the time of the German offensive in March. A. more probable explanation is that these essentially are shop questions, and are taken by the shop steward movement as a ready means of asserting their demand for a greater share of control by the workers.II.-RECRUITING.Position of the Quota.It was decided early in 1918 that by the end of June a quota of 108,000 Grade I. men should be released by the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty from the protected firms. The figures which follow show as closely as can be calculated the position on June 30th.   The Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty had on thatu  (33)6195  Pk20   125  7/18   B&amp;S
date released i.e., placed at the disposal of the Ministry of National Service for calling up 118,295 Grade I. men. This is a net figure excluding all men whose cases were suspended for any reason.&apos; The number of men credited as &quot;posted&quot; from Ministry of Munitions and Admiralty firms on June 30th was 78,134. It is probable that a further 6,000 had been posted in fact, but had not yet been credited in the records.The Grade I. men posted from munition firms as part of the quota do not exhaust by any means the recruiting contribution from these firms. During the first half of 1918 the Ministry of Munitions returned to the Army over 4,000 soldiers who had previously been released from the colours. There is also a steady flow of low grade men. A Ministry of National Service return for May 31st showed that up to that date 10,000 such men had been posted from munition firms since November 1917.Men bora in 1895, 1896 and 1897.The Ministry of Munitions have received a total of 12,331 claims for the temporary retention of men born in these years on the ground that they are pivotal or indispensable. The claims were spread over a very considerable number of industries, while the occupational diversity was even more noticeable. The following were the industries in which claims were most numerous: Iron and steel:Committee Firms -        -        -        -        -        -     4,497Other (including some rough engineering)       -        -        -       5255,022Aircraft     -         -         -        - -        -        -     2,418Machine tools, machinery, plant and tools - 914Iron-ore mining 602Guns and components       -        -      &apos; - -        .         .       566Shells and components      -        -        - -        -        -       275Small arms and machine guns      - 253Tanks       -         -         -        -        - -        .         .       23210,282Other industries    -        -        -        -        -        -        -     2,049Grand Total - -        -        -   12,331iii.-housing.As the cost of building continues to rise, the difficulty increases of obtaining an economic rent on 70 per cent, of the cost of permanent houses as required by the Treasury. In the case of isolated factories, as at Glengarnock (Ayrshire), the houses are provided in order to attract labour from other districts, and this object is likely to be defeated if removal is involved from a cottage rented at 6s. to one rented at 13s. In the case of congested areas, such as Coventry or Barrow, the competition of prospective tenants makes it possible to secure the higher rent, but there is obviously a danger that a claim for higher wages will follow, and any such increase could not be restricted to the tenants of the new houses, but might spread through a whole district, or even through a whole industry.
