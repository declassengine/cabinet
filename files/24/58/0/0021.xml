(This Document la the property of His Britannic Majesty18 Government).SECRET. WAR CABINET.G.T.5131,&quot;Re*afforostation.&quot; Memorandum &quot;by the President of tho Board of Agriculture,Cn reading the report of Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes on Re-afforeatation (0.315), I am not&apos;satisfied that my opinion is correctly represented therein,The report states that &quot;Mr. Prothero admitted in the abstract it was the proper course to follow though he feared it might not be found practicable in view of the opposition from certain parts of tho United Kingdom.&quot;    Later I am included among &quot;the remaining authorities are unanimously of opinion that a much bolder solution, involving the creation of a new central authority with control of policy and finance, and with, it- possible, a separate forestry service subordinate to it, should be adopted.&quot;I need not discuss my abstract acceptance of the principle of a central forest authority for the United Kingdom.     It does not appear to me to be in present circum-stanoes, feasible, and is open to the objection that it attempts to separate the administration of agriculture and forestry.     I adhere to my support of the procedure proposed by the Minister of Reconstruction.     This I consider will ensure a central authority controlling the forestry policy of the Unitod Kingdom without introducing divisions in the administrative control of land for both agriculture and forestry.R.E. PROTHERO.July 16th, 1918.
