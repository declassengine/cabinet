The Military Aepresentativea, having considered the report of the Inter-Allied Transportation Council on the subject of the   t i withdrawal from the Belgian Army of skilled- railwaymen (Annexure &quot;A&quot;)j and having taken into consideration the recommendations con-tained in Joint Note No .23 approved by the Supreme v/ar Council on 1st Kay 1918, decided severally to invite the attention of their respective Governments to&apos; the benefits which would accrue from the point of view of the working of the railways, by. the release of the skilled railwaymen still serving in the ranks of the Belgian Army.3c 3  /i. x(this pocu&amp;sarr is the property of his britaknic majesty&apos;s GOVEiaaiSKTj
A g j i x u a E vk*,BELGIAN RAILWAY PERSONNEL..Memorandum by the British  representative, Inter-Allied Transportation Council (No. A/45 d/- 1-3/7/18).In its Report dated 9th April, 1918, the Inter-Allied Transportation Council pointed out that, apart from men serving in Railway Units, a certain number of railway men and especially tf engine crews1 were still mobilised in the Belgian Army.In a Collective Note No-. 23 dated 18th April, 1918, the Military Representatives to the Supreme War Council expressed the opinion that this personnel might be placed at the disposal of the Allied Armies to relieve the transportation situation. These proposals were approved by the Supreme War Council in the course of its 5th Session at ABBEVILLE on the 2nd lay, 1918.The applications made to the Belgian Government have resulted since that date in placing at the disposal ef the French Railways 180 to 200 firemen&quot;(letter No. 2054 from the Belgian Minister of War to the French Minister of Transportation.)This assistance, though appreciable, is nevertheless insufficient having regard to the resources still unused in the Belgian Army.   Belgian railway men a&amp;a stiil mobilised up to the 1906 Class, although French railway men have been returned to the Railways up to the 1912 Class.The argument advanced by Major CUMONt&quot;, . sent by the Belgian Government to give information to the Inter-Allied Transportation Council, that the Belgian Army had exhausted its sources of recruitment, and saw its effectives constantly   -diminishing, is certainly not without weight.   It must be accepted that technical personnel cannot be taken from the Belgian Army without a corresponding reduction of Belgian mili-tary strength.   Nevertheless the necessity for skilled railway personnel is at the moment so urgent that it has already been f*und necessary to withdraw from American fighting units men with railway training.   It is. therefore a question of with-drawing Belgians or Americans.   From the transportation point *f view, the Belgians are of immensely greater value *n account of their knowledge of the French&apos; language and French methods of working.Consequently the Inter-Allied Transportation Council is of opinion that renewed application should be made tp the Belgian Government to place at the disposal of the French Railways all the engine crews and train crews now in the Belgian Army up to the 1912 Class, excluding men serving in Railway Units,(Sgd.)
