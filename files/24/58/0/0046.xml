This Document is the Property ofo pVbX His Britannic Ma eety&apos;8 &apos; overnmem 19 9-lt.    /home affairs committee,i,T.SlUrt &quot;:, kCLiteries ^ *NOTE.The annexed Bill is intended to give effect to the proposal in the memorandum submitted by the Home Secretary to the War Cabinet (G.T.4763).In England, as well as probably in Scotland, a lottery is not only illegal by statute but is also a common law nuisance.     It is therefore necessary to insert in the Bill words to remove liability for the offence at common law0In England the statutory prohibition on lotteries depends on a large number of Acts beginning with the Act of 10. Will*3,c.33.     Some of these Acts extend to Scotland ae well as England, and by s.60 of 21, Geo*38CgI4 the British Acts relating to lotteries were extended to Ireland.    There is no collective title for all these statutes and it seems unnecessary to mention them all specifically.Having regard to the language of existing Acts the words &quot;allot or distribute by way of lot or chance&quot; seems to be the proper way of describing a lottery.It has been assumed in drafting the Bill that it is intended to give a clean exemption to all lotteries promoted by war charities, and, not as. in the lew Zealand Act of 1915, to make the exemption dependent on the obtaining of i licence from the Home Secretary or some other Government Department.The only statute now in force under which lotteries are legalised appears to be the Art Unions Act, 1846, (9 &amp; 10 Viet, c.48), but the form of that Act loes not afford any guidance in the drafting of the present Bill.4U147.
