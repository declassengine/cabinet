! [Thi^ Dpcument isHhe Property,of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.!col Printed for the War Cabinet. July 1918.&apos;&apos;I^gHfidential.I CIRCULATE&apos; the following notes on disputes in existence in the country as indicating the existence of a somewhat serious state of labour unrest in munitions industries.(Signed)        WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.July 17, 1918.I. At Shejjield-The ironmoulders of the Sheffield district struck this morning. One firm in this district (Hadfields) had, prior to the war, reduced its hours to 48 and paid Is. per week more for the shorter hours than is paid by firms working longer hours. Certain other firms in the same district continue to work 53 hours, but the ironmoulders employed in these firms desire the same high hourly rate for the 53 hours week as Hadfields pay for a 48 hours week. The men brought the case before the Committee on Production, who found their claims not established. If granted, this would mean an addition to the weekly earnings of 85. or ds., and must inevitably affect many men in other trades in the district. The masters (who conferred with the men. yesterday) refused the concession. The iron-moulders came out this morning.2. II.M. Factory, Avonmouth (Poison Gas). Here the plumbers have struck on the constructional work of this factory, which is in process of being built. There has been a controversy extending over the last 20 years between the plumbers on the one hand, and the domestic and heating engineers, the A.S.E., and Coppersmiths&apos; Union on the other, the plumbers claiming a monopoly of iron, cast iron and steel pipe work. The plumbers have chosen the present moment to bring this demarca-tion dispute to a head, and struck on Monday morning. No difference has been reported under the Act.Sir G. Askwith has sent a telegram of protest against the men&apos;s action, pointing out the high priority and importance of the work stopped. The work being national and controlled, there is of course no excuse for insisting on demarcation lines, and it would seem on existing data that the strikers should be firmly dealt with.3. Lilacand Gorse Mill, near Oldham. There was a strike here recently, but the men returned on the understanding that certain points would be subjected to enquiry and arbitration, and that the parties would be bound by the award. Last Tuesday and Thursday the men held meetings in working hours to protest against alleged delay in the publication of the arbitrator^ report. For the time thus lost they now wish to be paid. The firms are, however, deducting the time lost on Tuesday from last week&apos;s wages, and intend to deduct the time lost on Thursday from this week&apos;s wages.The men resent this, and intend to strike at 12.30 p.m. to-day.4. Coventry. At Coventry four firms have been made subject, to an embargo on the engagement of additional skilled labour. The embargo is resented by skilled labour working at the four firms, and also generally in Coventry. The Coventry Joint Engineering Trades Committee have now, on behalf of the men concerned, handed to the Coventry Employers&apos; Association a week&apos;s notice to stop work throughout Coventry failing the removal of the embargo.5. Gateshead: Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd. Here a foreman discharged a woman some time ago. for refusing to carry out an order. Victimisation was alleged, and the management reinstated the woman, implicitly admitting that they had been at fault. The men came out on Saturday, because a demand which they subsequently put forward for the foreman&apos;s dismissal had been refused. The Department are in touch with the management, who wished no action taken during the week-end.6. Farnborough: Royal Aircraft Establishments. The strike here arose from the discharge of certain men on police duty. Five men were on duty, three of them discharged soldiers, and two civilians of military age. The former were dismissed as the result of allegations by the latter. A strike resulted, the strikers demanding that this process should be exactly reversed, i.e., the two civilians dismissed and the three ex-soldiers reinstated. An assistant commissioner from the Labour Adviser&apos;s Department has proceeded to the establishments to-day to enquire into the matter.
7. Birmingham: Austin&apos;s, There has for some time been trouble here owing to the revocation of a bonus on output which had been improperly given. The bonus question was referred to arbitration, the result of which is not yet declared. The refusal of the management to recognise the Works Committee was an additional grievance. A mass meeting was held yesterday by the employees, and the following terms claimed: (i.) Sir Herbert Austin be given 24 hours&apos; notice to receive a deputation fromAustin Works Committee to discuss grievances, (ii.) The Ministry of Munitions be notified there must be a change in manage-ment, including Sir Herbert Austin, (iii.) Mr. Lyall, shop superintendent of 8-inch and gun shops to be removed, (iv.) Would not accept any Committee on Production award reducing the bonusin the gun section.Sir Herbert Austin has been interviewed this morning. His difficulty is largely that of dealing with unauthorised shop stewards. Under the shop stewards&apos; agree-ment, such shop stewards as the Union may appoint or authorise are alone entitled to be recognised by the management, and none such had recently been appointed at this firm.There is a very strong feeling amongst the workers against the management in general, and Sir Herbert Austin in particular.8. Manchester; Crossiey Motors-Here an expert rate fixer quarrelled with certain of the men and used obscene language to them. The men insisted on his dis-missal. The firm, who set a great value on the rate fixer&apos;s services, offered an ample apology, which was refused. Nothing short of dismissal would satisfy the men, who threatened to strike. The Ministry advised the firm to suspend the man, and offered to put the issue to the test meanwhile by a prosecution of the offender for his obscene language under shop&apos;s rules. Instead of doing this, the firm yesterday took a ballot of the men on the question of the rate fixer.&apos;s dismissal. If the ballot were favourable to them it was understood that the man should be reinstated, but it was apparently not agreed what line should be taken if it were unfavourable. The ballot, in fact, was adverse to the firm, who are now asking the Ministry to prosecute the man for a breach of works rules, and he is meanwhile suspended.9. Grahavie White&apos;s, Hendon. The firm have received a demand from their shop stewards that certain charge hands and foremen who remained at work during the recent aircraft strike should be discharged or transferred. The Department have advised the firm to refuse this demand, and have informed them that if a strike occurs, as has been threatened, prosecution of the men concerned will be considered.10. Waddon National Aircraft Factory. Here some shop stewards prevented stokers from stoking the furnaces employed in connection with important work on wood ash. The foreman took the stokers&apos; place and the shop stewards prevented him by threats of violence from continuing to work. The furnace ran down and the supply of a large quantity of valuable wood ash was thus jeopardised Legal opinion is now being taken and the facts examined to determine whether a prosecution under D.E.R. 42 would be possible.11. Gainsborough: fa) Marshall&apos;s. Two woodworkers were discharged by this firm, and the Carpenters and Joiners&apos; Society alleged victimisation, The matter was handled by the Ministry of Labour for three weeks, before being referred to this Ministry. Immediately on reference an investigation officer was directed to report on the position. The men had finally decided to strike unless the matter were immediately adjusted.  The investigation officers report is awaited.(&amp;.) Certain electricians at Gainsborough claimed to have been promised the Office of Works London rate when working at Gainsborough, and made certain other demands. The demands were refused, and the men struck. After some negotiation, it was agreed to refer the demands to arbitration. The men, however, claimed pay for two days during which they were out and during which the negotia-tions were continuing. &quot;They allege that during these two days they were locked out. They profess to have received on Tuesday morning a telegram from, a London Office of Works shop steward informing them that all their demands had been conceded, and they state that they offered to resume work on this1 basis, but that their offer was refused. In fact, the telegram they received was inaccurate, and was in substance contradicted by telegram which they received later on the same day from Mr. Webb, the London secretary of their LTnion.   This second telegram
directed them to resume work on the basis of their claim being referred to arbitra-tion. The men now threaten to strike on Thursday, the 18th, unless pay for the two days during which they were out is conceded.12. Birmingham: Daiiaston^A. strike at some seventeen firms occurred in the Darlaston bolt and nut trade, the men complaining of low piece-rates. After failing to secure what they wanted by arbitration, the Unions made an agreement with the employers, the terms being that chartered accountants should examine the books of the firms, and if the average piece-work earnings were shown to be less than 67s, fid., they should be made up to that figure. The average earnings turned out to be 69s. 5d,, and the men were accordingly informed by their trade union officials that they could receive no advance. They thereupon went on strike, and are still out. The chartered accountants report, athough averse to the men, show that while the average earnings are 69s. 5d., at some firms the earnings largely exceed this figure, and at others they largely fall short of it. In the case of the latter firms, the agreement clearly inflicts a certain hardship. The chief obstacle to a settlement.which might otherwise be effected by readjustment of hours, is the not unnatural fear of the National Employers&apos; Federation that such a settlement may affect the tube trade. The Department is trying to find a basis of settlement which will avoid such reactions, and offers to hold a meeting of the parties immediately work is resumed.13./ Newport National Shell Factory.-Herei the unskilled and semi-skilled male labour have for some time been discontented with their basic rates. A demand which they put forward for a 30s. basic rate was refused by the Committee on Production on the 27th June. Discontented with this award the men repudiated certain piece-work prices and a scheme of bonus on output which their representa-tives had accepted on the 8th July, and the whole of the unskilled and semi-skilled workers, men and women, went on strike the next day.A readjustment of machinery is now taking place, which will reduce the number of unskilled and semi-skilled male labour required without reducing output.
