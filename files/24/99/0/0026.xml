T(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)*CONFIDENTIAL. C.P.-726.Copy NoCABINET.HIGH PRICES.(Circulated for information in connection with the decision of the Supreme Council, on February 23rd, 1920.)I.II.III.IV.V.n.The questions that, need answering are the followingTo what extent are high prices due to :-(a) Currency Causes(b) Scarcity generally or exceptional scarcity of particular things.(o) Combination.As regards Currency Causest i)&apos; blow c an &quot;pipe r bo brought to a par with gold? (iii Will gold prices continue above pro-war gold prices?AS regards soaroity, what steps will remove this e.g. tho Restoration of Europe,   How can this be secured?   How can greater output per head be secured?   As regards food, would centralised buying keep prices down?.Are the high prices consequent upon currency oauses and general scarcity adequately passed on to wages, so that the workman suffers, in no greater proportion than anybody else?Hov; can exceptionally high profits be prevented when the cause of high prices is exceptional scarcity of particular things? (It is in this case that profiteering occurs).Is it best(a) to prevent abnormal profits from being made, or(b) to tax or confiscate them when made?If the farmer, how is the fair distribution of tho scarce things to be arranged at home and internationally?Will State interference check enterprise and cause unemploy-mont?%st level of profits as compared with&apos;pro-war will attract capital into industry, bearing in mind (a)   tho fall in purchasing power of dividends, (b) high cost of replacements (o) expectation of a fall of prices in the near future?An attempt is made in this Memorandum to suggest answers to most of these questions, mainly with reference to conditions In the United Kingdom.Far the most important cause of high prices generally is the Currency Cause.   Scarcity comes next, and this has undoubtedly a largo effect, particularly with regard to certain classes of things. Combination plays some part in particular instances but, broadly speaking, over tho field as a whole, it is relatively negligible.
Compared with 1913 wholesale prices have adr^ino-ed^e^^alXtfwjB^ United.Spates    -   120 per cent. Japan -   160   &quot;      &quot;United Kingdom - 170 &quot; &quot; France -   300   &apos;*      &quot;Italy -   300   &quot;      &quot;The ri;.3e has been world-wide and has affoctod in no small degree countries like the United States and Japan who hare not been compelled to depart from the gold basis.Broadly speaking, the general level of prices is an expression of tho ratio between spending power on the one hand end the volume of goods on the other.   It is evident that with the energies of the world devoted to destruction for over four years, the volume of goods is greatly reduced.   Moreover, owing to reduction of hours and other causes, output per head has fallen.But on the other suda of the account there has been an enormous increase in spending power.   In&quot;, order to finance the war each belligerent found it necessary to increase the amount of currency in circulation..     It was not possible to raise sufficient funds by taxation and loans from bona fide savings and Governments were compelled to resort to borrowing from the banks or to the use of the &quot;printing press&quot;.   Borrowing from tho banks in this country involved the oreation of extra deposits, thus placing added spending power in the hands of the public.     The increase of bank deposits necessi-tated enlarged issues of currency notes.There is no noed to pursue a futile disoussion as to whether currency notes were the cause or effect of rising pricos - at least they were the sine qua non.How tho note circulation has grown is indicated by tho following figures:-In tho United Kingdom the number Of notes roso from under  30,000,000.in 1913 to nearly  450.000,000 at the end of 1919 (but about  120,000,000 of the latter figure must bo considered as replacing gold coins in use in 1913). In J&amp;Vance the number rose from  230,000,000 in 1913 to  1491,000,000 in 1919;   in Italy from  110,000,000 to  700,000,000.The. prices ruling at present in European countries are with few exceptions, paper prices.   But it is important to note-2-
S3note that goIdprices have also risen greatly, that is to say gold has depreciated in terras of commodities.   During the war gold flowed into the countries whose currency re-remained convertible into gold, end raised their prices. The rise in the United States of America of 120$ over pre-war prices indicates this. .   A considerable part of tho rise in prices in the United Kingdom is due to this depreciation of gold.   The depreciation of paper measured against gold may be put at, say   20^ for the United Kingdom and 4.5$ for Trance and Italy.It should bo added that particular classes of things are dear in certain countries because they have to bo imported, while freight rates rule high and their exchanges are heavily adverse (owing to their high import require-ments and low exports.)There is no simple remedy for all round high prices. The problem must be attacked from all sides and. the following measures, if carried out thoroughly, would all contribute towards the desired result:-(a) increased production of commodities(b) limitation of consumption(c) curtailment of manufacture of oredit, at least a balancing of Government revenue and expenditure and a gradual comtractionas soon as possible of paper issues.Tho problem of the specially high prices of certain things, out of which abnormally large profits are made, is a particular and not a general problem.The high prices of clothing for inatance are due to exceptional scarcity of the best quslity Iwool and a relatively heavy world demand after the long war.   It is the best grades mainly that are sought and prices are consequently forced to abnormally high levels.In comparison with most wars, the effects on prices in this country are far from being out of the way:-In the Napoleonic Wars English prices rose 75 per cent and took 8 years to become normal again.
In the American Civil Wary American prices rose 100 per cent and took: a dozen years or more.to &quot;become normal.In this war - the moat exhausting of all wars m in which most European nations V/ere absorbed almost to a man directly or indirectly, English wholesale prices rose no more than 170 per cent.Two questions in particular are suggested, which it would be desirable to answer if it were possible. These questions are1. What will the new level of gold prices be when gold payments are resumed again by the belligerent countries?2. By what process and at what time will the gold basis be restored.Broadly speaking, gold prices to-day are 120 per cent above their pre-war level.   Thf s, however, is due to some extent to the fact that the gold Of the World is piled up in the countries whose currency is still definitely based on gold.   When the belligerent countries return to gold payments, these heaps will be dissipated.   Con-sequently, on this account, gold ;prices will tend to come down.But gold prices will not fall to the old level.   The reasons are two-fold.   In the first place hoards have been scattered and will largely remain scattered.   In the second place the necessities of the war enforced the use of a monetary machinery which will undoubtedly be utilised to some extent after the war with the result that there will be a permanent economy in the employment of gold for monetary purposes.    A far greater use is made of cheques than was the case before the war, and gold coins have largely disappeared.     It is improbable that their use will be restored to any large extent.   Notes can be effectively based on gold if gold is.paid out by the bank on demand against notes and, an adequa   reserve is kept.A reduced demand for gold for monetary purposes would mean that more gold was available for other purposes;   and it goes without saying that the more the supply of a thing is increased for any purpose the less becomes it value. The purchasing power of gold, and the notes based on it, will consequently tend to be less than before the war; for the exchange value of gold in terms of other things generally will tend to be less.Hovi much le^s, nobody can say, but the results that have followed from tho redistribution of gold during the war seem to indicate that it will be considerably loss. A futuro level of gold prices some 75 per cent above the pre-war level is not an extreme estimate.
The resumption of Gold payments is impossi hie so long as there is a gar botwooii gold and paper prices.     Its effect now would be an enormous drain on the gold reserve, n collapse of prices (in consequence of the paying In of paper money to get gold for export) and very high bank rates to protect the shrinking reserve.     The first essential is the closing of the gap between gold and paper prices.This gap can be closed either by -(1)   Paper prices falling;   or by (2)   Gold prices rising;   or by (5)   Paper prices coming down and gold prices going up,A further rise of gold prices is not impossible.&apos;    This would make deflation easier, but it will be a delicate operation.     In its conduct a careful watch will have to be kept, lest enterprise be paralysed and unemployment and a slump in wages should result.    The bear-ing of deflation on Government finance, particularly with reference to war debts, need not be disoussed here,-

Scarcity is a potent cause of high, prices. The sovereign remedy for scarcity is hard work. But regular Fork is being prevented in large parts of Europe, by disorganisation and lack of means to obtain raw materials.     Also .coal is short and transport has broken down.One of the most promising means of aiding the recovery of the disorganised parts of Europe is to bo found in the response of Commercial enterprise in other Countries. Schemes are being developed for-supplying raw &apos; materials to be worked up, tho suppliers recei-ving part of the final product as payment,     But even in these lines England can give only limi-ted assistance in view of the immediate need of her exports to pay for imports. -   As regards transport, something is being done by tho Communications Section in removing difficulties by supporting the local administration and super-vising the spending of credits for railway mater-ial.     An attempt Is being made in Central. Europe to organise inter-state wagon exchange the lack of which has been one of the main obstacles to the re-establishment of normal communications.The reduction in hours has nnfortunately meant a serious diminution of output just at the time when greater output is urgently required but Labour is strongly averse from a return to the former hours;   some improvement may be&apos;&apos; expected;   however, from a rise in efficiency.High prices of food are more serious than high prices of other tilings, and it has been maintained that centralised buying effects some material economies.     On the other hand it has to be remembered that the retention of unnecessary Government action retards thercsump-tion of normal conditions and that a time comes&quot;&quot; when, the commercial world being organised as it is, recourse to the ordinary&quot;channels of trade produces the best results.
The re-action on the diatributiori of income of the fall in the value of money is1evident in every stage of economic life. Wages have risen, and money profits have risen.Generally speaking wages have risen in this country by at least as much as the rise in the essential coat of living, which is less than the rise in general prices.    But the workman in spending outside essential costs comes within the range of the higher level of prices.Aq to profits there ia m little confusion in the public mind.     The position may ba put as follows -Suppose prices generally have doubled, that is to 3ay that the purchasing power of money has been reduced to a half, Then, other things being equal, a producing business can pay twice the old dividend, just ac it can pay twice the old wages.   If it previously paid 10 per cent it can now pay SO per cent.   And just as twice the old wages mean no more to the workman in if/ha/t the wages will buy, ao twice the old dividend means no more to shareholders, beoause each pound buys only half as much aa before. But these obvious considerations notwithstanding, there is a prevalent disposition to-day to regard increased dividends, aven if they are no more than sufficient to make up for the rise in prices as a proof of profiteering.Writing up capital 100 per cent restores the old dividend of 10 per cent,,but as it is paid on twice the capital the real position ia the same as it was before.   The doubling of nominal capital is apt to be regarded as an exploitation of the public, but clearly it means no more than bringing the valuation of the capital (?ihich earns only as much as before in real things) into line with the new scale of nominal values.Again, if a man sells his business for twice the old value he gets no more in purchasing power than he would have received if he had sold for the old value when general prices were at the old level.Indeed, as a matter of fact, the owner of plant which is fairly old ia prejudiced by the rise in values because his depreciation fund will be insufficient for complete replacement at the new level of values if he continues paying into it at the old rate.     In the case of plant that needs early replacement tue whole of the earnings of capital in the intervening period wght even prove insufficient to make up the needful sum.The writing up of capital now to the level of present values will necessitate its writing down again after prices have fallen - but it ia unlikely that the same degree of writing dov?n will be needed, as it is most improbable that prices will subside to their old level or anything near the old level.
-8-The fact, of oouwe, rciriaJjas that enoTrriou* pflPotf^s. are being made on share-capital in many cases to-day, and tbatyOO fo.r as they go beyond what is justified by the fall in the vt4.ue - v of money find so far as tho necessity of replacement is not imminent the recipients of these profits are being enriched partly at the expense of ,the community and partly at the expense of those who hold that part of the capital vrhich bears a fixed rate of interest.   Moreover, many are undoubtedly capitalising their good fortune by soiling out.     There is enough in the situation, properly understood to cause labour unrest and unfortunately through misunderstanding and exaggeration public resentment is being intensified.   But any drastic and far-reaching action on the part of the Government (beyond the pruning policy contemplated by the Profiieering Act)would probably do more harm than good and it would prove a mistake in the long run to take steps calculated to- affect future equipment detrimentally.
itThe above considerations exeunt for a large part of the rise in profits, and it must W borne in, mind that when comparing profits in 1914 with those in 1919 regard must also be had to the effect of taxation.   Take as an example a firm which in pre war days made a pro fit, on  100,000 (r-eferr-ed to as-, its pre-war standard) and assume that since the war this HrW has made  ,500,000 profit a year.   The effect of taxation will be somewhat as followsPre-WarPre-War Profit  100,000Less Income Tax atl/- 5,000Profit in 1919 Less Pre-War&apos;StandardLess 40$ Exaess profitsLess Income tax &amp; sup er ta* at 10&apos;/-Balance- 500,000100,000 4007000160,000120,000 120,000Net Profit 95,000Plus Pre-war Standard from which income and super tax at 10/** in   have been deducted   50,000 T707560&quot;In this case, therefore; although  500,000 is shown as profit, the real net profit is  170,000 as compared with  95,000 before the war.   The real value of the 1919 net profits is &quot;less than thatcf the 1914 profits and that at a time when the financing of business calls for large sums of money and when it is necessary to build up reserves against the fall in markets which Is bound to occur.The present wave of prosperity is real,, but it may well not be lasting, and the scale of profits in any&apos; industry can only be fairly assessed after a period In which good years are offset by bad.   The end of the war marked the beginning of a new era; happily the new era has begun with prosperity, but that must not blind us to the possibilities of the near futureeNo absolute answer can be given to the question whether it is best to prevent excessive profits from being made or to tax them heavily when made.   Circumstances alter cases.   Generally speaking the latter course is best in that it has not the Strangling effect on business activities which is the Wofst feature of detailed State regulation of the conduct of business.   But where an essential article in common use is ftn question some regard must be paid to the price paid by the Consumer.   There is, however, the difficulty in many cases in imposing maximum prices that increased export may cause a famine at home; and even in the absence of this difficulty, when the lower price tempts more buyers, rationing may be entailed to ensure equitable distribution^It has to be remembered moreover that for a time the re-covery of Trade being in the balance particularly on account of the uncertainty of future prices, that an extensive reaction to State control might so check enterprise as to cause unemployment and promote depression.   A depression now, through its effects on exports, would again throw heavily against us the balance of trade which is nearing restoration.&apos; A.C.G.President of the Board of Trad25.2.20.
