(initdi)   I,M.February 23rd, 1920,The Vice-president of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland desires to offer the f61lowing observations on the Memorandum of Lord Lee concerning the Government $^garantee of a minimum price for &quot;Wheat,The acreage under Wheat in Ireland during the past four years vras :-1916.....i,....   76,438 acres1917 ........... 124,082     &quot;1918........... 157,326   . w1919..........^   69,727    &quot;There is every reason to anticipate that the decrease which set in last year will be continued in 1920. This must be attributed largely to the fact that the price of Vlheat has been kept down to a fixed figure of 76/- per quarter notwithstanding that there has been a free market and a relatively higher price for Oats and Barley.It is obvious that eo long as the Wheat Commission is the only buyer there cannot be sn open market for Wheat, as there is for Oats and Barley.If the Wheat-area is to be maintained, not to say extended, it will be necessary^ since there cannot be a free market, to increase the prioe paid by the Wheat Commission to a figure which will make the cultivation of &quot;Wheat at least as attractive as that of Gats and Barley.$he Gazette price of Oats in the last week of January of this y!ear was 5S/7&amp;.&apos;per quarter of 312 lbs., equal to  21 per ton, as against 76/- per 480 lbs, for Wheat,-equal only to  17.14.8 per ton,     On the strict parity of the price ruling immediately before the war, Wheat should now be making well over&apos;100/-.      Of course, this is an extreme way of presenting the position, as it is probable that the price of Oats will fall shirply as soon as Atlantic freights adjust themselves. The Department consider that a guaranteed minimum price of 90/-would &apos;probaT*ly offer sufficient inducement and stimulate Wheat sowing considerably.It must always be remembered that the uncertainty of the labour position has been one of the chief factors in bringing about the reduction of tillage.17th Februaryf 1920.
