The International Socialist Movement.The Second and Third Internationals.The decision of the Welsh and North-Western Divisional Councils of the I.L.P. to join the Third (Moscow) International, coming so soon after the similar decision of the Scottish branch of the I.L.P., draws attention to the position of British Labour and Socialist bodies with regard to their affiliation to the two Internationals. The present tendency of the political labour organisations in this country io move to the left appears to be of increasing importance. It is a tendency which is apparently directly due to inter-national and foreign contacts, and it cannot be understood without information with regard to the recent progress of socialist movements abroad. In view of this, it may be useful to give a brief survey of the recent development of international and foreign socialist movements.The dissension in the ranks of the International Socialists became clear as soon as the attempt was made to resuscitate the organisation at the end of the war. In the principal belligerent countries the Socialists were already divided on the question of supporting the war, and subsequently on the question of responsibility for the War. The Russian revolution, resulting in the establishment of a Government based on the dictatorship of the proletariat, was an event which threatened to divide the Socialists(c1971)  150 3/20 h&amp;s q
on a still wider question, namely, whether they should adhere to the traditional methods, of democratic government or to those of the dictatorship of the proletariat. When the national Socialist organisations were summoned to attend the conference at Berne in the beginning of February, 1919, the Italian Majority Socialists and the Swiss Socialists refused to attend on the ground that the policy of the conference was not sufficiently advanced. In spite, however, of the fact that these more revolutionary bodies were absent, a resolution which upheld the traditional democratic principle, and in effect condemned the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat, was not passed unanimously. A minority resolution, proposed by Adler, German Majority Socialist, and Longuet, French Majority Socialist, did not go so far as to support Soviet principles, but warned the working-classes against the stigma which might be applied to the Russian Soviet Republic if they passed a premature judgment on political methods before they were in possession of sufficient material on which to base their conclusions. The supporters of this resolution included the French Majority Socialists, half the German-Austrian delegation, and the Dutch and Norwegians. During the interval between the meeting of the Second International at Berne in February and the meeting at Lucerne in August, the split within the International became wider. The delay in the conclusion of peace tended.to exasperate certain sections of the Socialists, and before the meeting at Lucerne a rival International had been setUP-     .      . .This Third International was inaugurated at a conference held at Moscow at thebeginning of March, 1919.   The programme laid down in the invitation which was issued to 40 Communist groups in West and East Europe is based on the principles adopted bythe Bolshevist Government in Russia.   These principles are :  (1) the overthrow ofCapitalism ; (2) the abolition of the Parliamentary and local government systems, andthe substitution of Soviets ; (3) the dictatorship of the Proletariat; (4) the socialisation of the means of production ; (5) enforced work by every member of the community ;(6) equal remuneration for all workers; (7) self-determination of peoples by referendum \(8) disarmament of the bourgeoisie in all countries and the arming of the working-classes ;(9) the abolition of all racial distinctions.   The Third International condenms the Secondas an opportunist combination of disparate groups ; but it should be noted that the ThirdInternational has not held any meeting of accredited representatives, since only a fewforeign residents in Moscow &quot; represented &quot; their groups on their own responsibility.At the Lucerne Conference of the Second International the left wing parties under the leadership principally of Longuet, French Majority, and Crispien, German Independent, succeeded in re-shaping both the report on Russia and the preamble to the reconstituted statute of the International, so that when adopted these were considerably more revo-revolutionary in tone than they were originally. In the opinion of Adler, both the Second and the Third Internationals were unsatisfactory, and he urged that it was necessary to create a higher authority by the fusion of the two before the Socialists could solve the problems before them. The Second International is no longer representative of Inter-national Socialism, for since the Lucerne conference a considerable number of Socialist bodies have joined the Moscow International. These organisations include the Italian. Official Socialist Party, the Danish Socialist Labour Party, the Norwegian Labour Party, the Swedish Social Democratic Left, two Communist parties in the United States, and in this country the British Socialist Party, the Socialist Labour Party, the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, the British International Workers of the World, the South Wales. Socialist Society, the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee, and the London Workers&apos; Committee.The German Independent Socialists have issued a circular to all Left Wing Parties in Europe stating&apos; that the party has definitely adopted the programme of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and recognises the Soviets as the instruments for establishing a Socialist society, and it has therefore decided to leave the Second. International and invite all European parties standing for the same principles as itself to meet it and the parties of the Third (Moscow) International at some central place with a view to founding an efficient. Labour International. With the issue of this invitation by the German Independents,, the various Socialist parties in Europe are thus faced with three courses of action, viz., to adhere to the Second or Third Internationals or to form a new International. Since the issue of the German Independents&apos; circular several national parties have reached a. decision on the matter. The Spanish and Finnish Socialists have decided, provisionally, at least, to remain in the Second International. The British Socialist Party has decided to adhere to the Third. The French Socialist Congress at Strasburg on the 27th February discussed the whole situation and decided by 4,330 votes to 337 to leave the Second International; and accepted by 3,031 votes against 1,621 a proposal not to adhere im-mediately to the Third International, but to accept the plan of the German Independents, for a conference.
Part II. Departmental.The Trade Board Movement.A steady advance continues in the process of bringing within the operation of the Trade Boards Acts the less highly organised and more poorly, paid trades of the United Kingdom. Since the middle of October, at which, date attention was last drawn in this report to the progress of the movement, 21 new Trade Boards have been established, of which 13 are in operation in Great Britain, four in England and &quot;Wales, one in Scotland and three in Ireland.* The Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain), which covered ready-made and wholesale bespoke tailoring, has been dissolved and two distinct Boards, one for retail bespoke tailoring and one for ready-made and wholesale bespoke tailoring, have been set up in its place, and the Irish Tailoring Board is being reconstituted on the same lines. These new Boards raise the total number in operation in Great Britain (including Boards established for England and Wales and Scotland) to 30, and eight Boards are at work in Ireland.  In addition preparations for the establishment of Trade Boards are* The trades involved are : In Great Britain : button-making ; coffin furniture and cerement-making ; flax and hemp; fur; hair, bass and fibre; jute; perambulator and invalid carriage-making; pin, hook and eye ; twine and net; stamped or dressed metal wares; wholesale mantle and costume ; tailoring (two Boards). In England and Wales: aerated waters; hat, cap and millinery ;. dressmaking and Women&apos;s light clothing; milk distributive trade (separate Boards are to be established for Scotland and Ireland for the last three trades). In Scotland: aerated waters. In Ireland: aerated waters; brush and broom trade ; boot and shoe repairing.The National Council of the I.L.P. will meet at the beginning of April, and it will be interesting to see what decision it will reach. On the one hand, decisions of divisional councils have already, as is mentioned at the beginning of this note, been taken in favour of affiliation to the Third International, but the National Council had previously drafted an explanatory memorandum on its attitude to Bolshevism, in which it expressed its definite opposition to the principle of dictatorship, and maintained that the Soviet form of Govern-ment is not the best for an industrial community. If the I.L.P. adheres to this statement, it is clearly impossible for it to affiliate to the Third, International. On the other hand, the adherents of the Second International have been severely shaken in their loyalty by the decision to postpone the next general meeting from February till August, as this is taken to be a confession of weakness. The chief parties which remain in it are the British Labour Party, the Belgian Labour Party and the German Majority Socialists, and all these are considered particularly reactionary by the Left Wing Parties because of their co-operation with bourgeois governments either during or after the war. Thus the position is that most of the parties which remain in the Second are dissatisfied with it, but on the other hand they do not feel able to accept the doctrines of the Third.Apart from dissatisfaction with the ineffectiveness of the Second International during the war and with the co-operation of its leading men in bourgeois governments, it is obvious that questions of fundamental policy are disturbing all Socialist parties. There are some who take the Russian Soviet Government as a symbol for the new organization of the State which they desire and do not trouble to be too precise as to the applicability of its principles in Great Britain or France. These form a small group round which gather those who are vaguely discontented with their wages or the prevailing prices; but they are not likely to control or direct the great body of organised labour.On the other hand, it is clear that the confidence in the older form of representative government has been shaken; the word &quot; democracy &quot; has lost its magic. The traditional policy of parliamentary socialists is opposed as old-fashioned by great numbers of the rank and file ; and in this matter at least the leaders are thinking less vigorously than their critics. Two general constructive ideas seem to be implied in. the prevailing criticism : one is that the basis of the right of each man to political power, should be the work he does and not either his property or the fact that he is a man. This forms the link between the political socialists and the trade unionists and has forced the I.L.P. to adopt an industrial policy. Secondly, it is conceived that the unit of Government should be the small group, local or occupational, within which the individual can feel his direct power and responsibility. Hence the eagerness for capturing local government and extending its power. These new principles, however, are not yet worked out into any complete policy, although they serve to unsettle the established leaders.
well advanced in a number of other industries, three of which are, however, to be Boards in Scotland and Ireland similar to those already set up in England and Wales ; and three to be Boards in Ireland parallel to those already established in Great Britain. In addition to inquiries which are being made in various sections of the distributive trades with a view to applying the Acts, investigations are proceeding into industrial conditions m food manufacturing, embroidery, lace, ostrich feather and artificial flower making, and catering.In view of the growing demand for the extension of the Trade Board system the Government have made special provision for expediting the necessary work in order that effective machinery may be set up under the Trade Boards Acts to regulate the conditions in all trades in which organisation is not sufficiently advanced for that purpose at present. The success of the Boards in regulating wages in industries in which trade union action was not effective, the improvement in rates fixed by the Boards and the wider range of industries brought within the scope of the Acts have done much to demonstrate to employers and workpeople the value of the Boards. It would be difficult, except by a detailed examination of the conditions in each case, to indicate the value of the work done by the Trade Boards for the workers in the industries for which they have been established. One fact may be given as affording some slight measure of the part taken by the Boards in adjusting, to meet the present difficult situation, the conditions of employment of workers who, for the most part, are not sufficiently well organised to act for themselves. Since the beginning of November, the Minister has made 18 Orders confirming and bringing into statutory operation wage rates fixed for the first time, or varied by Trade Boards to meet the present position of industry. The Trade Boards, which are bound to fix general minimum time-rates, have been increasingly active in the use of their powers to fix general minimum piece-rates, piece-work basis time-rates, guaranteed time-rates and overtime-rates. Increased rates have now been fixed in trades in which Boards were established under the 1909 Act and the rise in wages involved is, in many cases, considerable. In the chain trade, to give only one example, the general minimum time-rate for hand-hammered chain has been raised from 4d. to l\d. an hour for female workers, and for dollied and tommied and hand-hammered chain, from the limits of Q\d. and lOd. to those of Is. 5d. and Is. ll^d. for male workers. The rates proposed by the new Boards run approximately from l\d. to &amp;\d. for women, and from Is. Id. to Is. If d. for men ; in one case that of the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board-Is. k\d. per hour has been fixed. The Boards are also exercising more frequently their power to fix special rates for special types of labour, and certain Boards, as for example the Sugar Confectionery and Food Preserving Board, have determined that men&apos;s rates shall be payable to women engaged in certain processes which are men&apos;s work.The Trade Boards, however, have not restricted themselves simply to settlements of wage questions, though this naturally has formed the most important part of their work, but are also increasingly exercising the powers conferred upon them of making recommenda-tions to Government Departments and of acting as joint consultative bodies for the industry.Most of the Boards have had under consideration rates for learners and apprentices, and in most cases the payment of rates for learners, &amp;c, has been dependent on the issue of a learnership certificate to which the Board has attached -conditions with a view to securing effective instruction in the industry. The Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain) have referred to its administrative committee, on which members of the National Trade Advisory Committee are to be co-opted for that purpose, the administration of the scheme for the training of disabled soldiers and sailors. Several other Boards have also agreed to assist the Employment Department in their work for disabled men by co-operating with Local Employment Committees in the assessment of alternative pensions. Among others the Boot and Shoe Repairing Trade Board (Great Britain), the Tin Box Trade Board (Great Britain), the Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain), are co-operating with the Factory Department of the Home Office with a view to improving the working conditions in factories and workshops. The Boards have also been consulted by Government departments in connection with lists of prohibited imports, as to openings for women in industry, vocational training, apprenticeship interrupted by war service, the Wages Temporary Regulation Act, and other matters. As in the case of the Joint Industrial Councils, the function of these bodies as a source of advice to the Government for the industries which they represent has not been overlooked.The possibility of a further development of policy in connection with Trade Boards has already been indicated in this Report.* Whilst the great majority of Joint Industrial18 See this Report for the 14th January, p. 18.
Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press.The Labour Movement.The result of the Paisley by-election was announced too late in the week to be dealt with by the majority of these papers. The &quot;New Statesman,&quot; however, announces that the Labour Party will not regard the failure of Mr. Biggar as a serious set-back, and is more concerned about Ashton and. Wrekin. This opinion of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; is supported by the scant notice which has been given to these latter results, and by the somewhat slighting remarks that have been made in the I.L.P. press with reference to the Labour candidates in these elections. &quot; Bob Roy,&quot; in &quot; Forward,&quot; trusts that trade union friction was not responsible to any great extent for the failures of Messrs. Robinson and Duncan. If trade union conflicts are to extend to the political field, he points out how adversely the position of the Labour Party will be affected. The &quot; Nation &quot; looks forward to the development of a joint working policy between the Independent Liberals and the Parliamentary Labour Party.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in his weekly article to &quot; Forward &quot; repeats the prophecies made last week by the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; the &quot; Nation &quot; and Mr. Philip Snowden, that the Prime Minister is preparing an electoral attack upon the position of the Labour Party, and that this attack will be based upon the attitude the trade unions are adopting towards discharged and disabled men. Mr. Macdonald believes that the purpose of the Govern-ment is to force the Labour Party into action. He is, therefore, all the more insistent that the Labour Movement should stick to politics, and that the special Trades Union Congress, which is to meet on 11th March to consider the mines nationalisation question, should decide to use all its resources in political propaganda and in support of the. Parliamentary Labour Party. Mr. Macdonald recommends the profiteering cry as having quite as many possibilities as the nationalisation cry.This advocacy of the claims of the political side of the Labour movement, is, however, accompanied by a persistent depreciation of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and the campaign in the I.L.P. press against the Parliamentary Party as at present constituted, which was so marked a feature last session, is being renewed with its old intensity. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; criticises the Labour members for their lack of skill in presenting the trade union case in the debate on the 18th February on Captain Hambro&apos;s motion. Mr. Snowden&apos;s criticism is perhaps more severe than that which appears in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; (the organ of the National Democratic Party) on this subject. The London Letter of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; contains one of its periodical attacks upon Mr. Adamson, who is described as a &quot; third-rate politician.&quot; The writer of this letter fears that Mr. Asquith&apos;s return will mean that the claim of the Labour Party to be the official opposition will be ignored by Parliament, press and public. He gives a catalogue of the questions which have been raised by the Labour Party this session ; in each case he thinks they have utterly failed.Domestic questions however, remain, the principal topics of discussion in the Labour and Socialist Press. The preliminary agends of the I.L.P. annual conference has been issued, and in this connection the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains a leading article recom-mending branches to refrain from sending their delegates to the conference definitely pledged to support any of the resolutions which will be discussed on the relations between the I.L.P. and the various international socialist bodies. It is pointed out that the annual conference provides an opportunity for full and free discussion, and ought not to be just a body to register the previous decisions of branches.  It is obviously feared that aCouncils have no desire that their wages agreements should be given legal force, there are several industries in which, owing to the competition of non-federated firms who refuse to abide by these agreements, the view has been strongly expressed by the Joint Industrial Council that some measure of compulsion should be brought to bear to make effective the wages agreements reached by the Council. The suggestion has been made by the Ministry that in cases in which wages are low in any branches of such trades and organisation is clearly ineffective, a Trade Board should be set up covering, at any rate, some section of the industry represented on the Joint Industrial Council, and that in this way wage rates should be fixed which it will be possible to enforce by law. The possibility of adopting such a course is now under consideration by some of the Councils.
majority of delegates may appear at the conference instructed to vote for immediate affilia-tion to the Third International, and this leading article is interesting in view of the pronounced tendency of all labour and socialist conventions to comprise delegates rather than representatives. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; complains of the indefiniteness of many of the terms used in these resolutions in the agenda which purport to sum up the attitude of the I.L.P. towards political, as opposed to industrial, action, and states that it would regret any pronouncement on the part of the annual conference, that membership of the Party should be contingent upon the full acceptance of the proposition that the chief function of the I.L.P. is the expression of the political method.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and Mr. Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; are devoting much space to reciprocal invective. &quot; The Call&quot; con-tains a long reply to the criticism of the Labour Party which appeared in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; last week. The British Socialist Party knows that its alliance with the Labour Party is not in accordance with Marxian dogma, but it is maintained that this alliance is thoroughly in accordance with the principles which are believed to underlie the Marxian method. The support which has been accorded by the National Labour Party to the Sinn Fein claim for self-determination, and the appearance at the Albert Hall Sinn Fein meeting of Messrs. Griffiths and 0&apos;Shannon on the same platform, result, in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot; Socialist,&quot; in the statement that the Sinn Fein Party is purely a bourgeois patriot party, and in recommendations to the Irish Socialist Party to make clear its attitude towards international socialism. &quot; Justice &quot; warns its readers that the considerable anti-capitalist feeling which is now gathering, has little or no socialist outlook and, therefore, that socialist propaganda is needed more than ever before.The Industrial Situation.There is nothing new in the few references which appear this week in these journals to the mines nationalisation question. The way in which the topic has fallen from grace may be judged from the fact that &quot; The Call &quot; devotes only one paragraph to the special Trades Union Congress, in which it merely registers its opposition to the proposal to continue political propaganda on the matter, and the continued faith of the B.S.P. in &quot; direct revolutionary action.&quot; The trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; discusses the controversy between the National Union of Eailwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos;&apos; Association.* This correspondent records his opinion that the importance of the &quot; industrial union &quot; movement to Socialism must not be exaggerated.! &quot; There must be a return to the revolutionary outlook and an insistence upon the fact that trade unions exist for the overthrow of capitalism.&quot; This diversion of English trade unionism into the paths of revolution, however, he thinks can only be achieved through the &quot; one big union &quot; and its corollary organisations, shop committees and district workers&apos; com-mittees. In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson mourns the revival after the war of the &quot; old social grudges and hostilities.&quot; &quot; The privileged classes show no willingness to surrender any of their advantages ; the Government grows harder and more callous ; the masses are resentful and hostile.&quot; Mr. Thompson asks what has happend to the National Industrial Conference.Prices and Profiteering.A leading article, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; testifies to the fact that this paper regards this question as the &quot; dominant national issue.&quot; The campaign started by the &quot; Daily Herald&quot; for nationalisation of all the profiteering industries, approaching at times a campaign for confiscation, has been the most outstanding feature of the agitation which began with the publication of the February issue of the &quot; Labour Gazette,&quot; synchronising as it did with increased tobacco, sewing cotton and petrol prices, and the publication of the report of the sub-committee of the Standing Committee on Trusts on sewing-cotton manufacture.^ This campaign of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has not, however, been favourably received in the Labour and Socialist Press. The leading article in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; points out that profiteering and high prices arise from many causes, and, in the opinion of this paper, the fundamental cause is the destruction of wealth during the war. &quot; The world cannot escape the ruin which has been brought upon it by the prolongation, of the war to the point of economically exhausting the belligerent nations.&quot;  From the tone of*&apos; Of. this Report, p. 125. . t Of. Report, 11th February, p. 72. . % Of, Report, 25th February, p. 107.
this article it would appear that the object of greatest concern to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is to establish the correctness of its attitude in 1916 and 1917 towards foreign affairs. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; is sarcastic in its references to the &quot; Daily Herald&quot; cam-paign, and suggests that attention should rather be devoted to recent cotton spinning mill sales, which, it thinks, are a more important cause of high prices of all cotton goods, than the activities of the group of sewing cotton manufacturing firms. The &quot; New Age &quot; is equally critical of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and draws its usual deductions from the facts of the situation. The more extreme papers, as was mentioned above, are just at present more concerned with the domestic troubles of their organisations; they have not con-centrated in any notable fashion on this question ; and, in any case, they would be slow to follow the lead of the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; Mr. T. Quelch, one of the more irresponsible writers to &quot;The Call,&quot; refers in an aside to &quot;&apos;&quot;revolutionary profiteering tribunals,&quot; but these papers can hardly be expected to ventilate remedies for a state of affairs which they believe should not be remedied, but rather regarded as welcome symptoms of a social upheaval. In the &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. R. B. Suthers defends the so-called levy on capital, while the &quot; Democrat &quot; approves in principle of the taxation of war fortunes, only to show how difficult and inequitable in practice such taxation might be.   ...       &apos;Wages and the Cost of Living. -The general aspects of this question are incidentally dealt with in the discussions on &apos; Prices and Profiteering. Three specific references may, however, be noticed. Mr. A. J. &quot;Whitlock continues in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; the discussion on the sliding scale clause in the agreement concluded between the N.U.R. and the Ministry of Transport. Mr. Whitlock argues from the fact that the sliding scale provides for a Is. increase or decrease in wages for every five points increase or decrease in the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; cost of living index number. His conclusion from this is that the sliding scale is based upon a pre-war standard railway men&apos;s wage of  1 per week, and he compares this figure unfavourably with the average working class family budget, which is the basis of the &quot;Labour Gazette &quot; index number (&quot; admittedly compiled to the workers&apos; disadvantage &quot;), and with Sir Leo Money&apos;s pre-war standard of  2 5s. Mr. Whitlock, of course, ignores the fact that these increases and decreases operate from a standard which equates a war wage of 38s. with a cost of living index number of 125. The &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; &quot;Woolwich Pioneer &quot; both refer to the Board of Trade figures as showing an increase in the cost of living&apos; since the outbreak of war of 135 per cent. These papers have, of course, confused the retail food prices index number with the cost of living index number properly so called. The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; adds to the gravity of its error by proceeding to complain that this 135 per cent, refers only to food prices. This paper chooses to think, that, were other commodities included, the percentage increase would be greater, and has not observed that the cost of living index number shows that the general increase has only been 130, per cent.Government Policy&quot; Forward &quot; contains a long article of the usual character which endeavours to show, by quoting unemployment statistics for the building trades as a whole, that the complaints of the Minister of Health with regard to the shortage of bricklayers are unfounded. The &quot;Unemployment Insurance Bill is referred to in the &quot;New Statesman,&quot; the &quot;Labour Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; declares that the general tone of labour opinion is hostile to the Bill, and that trouble may be experienced in putting, it into operation. This paper finds some difficulty in reconciling this opinion with the attitude of the Parliamentary Labour Party to the second reading of the Bill. &quot; The Party has virtually committed itself to the universal extension of contributory insurance.&quot; The &quot; London Letter &quot; of. the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; declares the Bill to be fundamentally bad. The principle is enunciated that each industry should bear the cost of its unemployed by levies on profits, but no reference is made to the arguments of the Minister in the second reading debate which went to show the administrative difficulties in the way of trade demarcation. The &quot;Labour Pioneer&quot; deals with the fear entertained by Friendly Societies towards the Bill. It is insisted that there are far too many approved societies concerned already with the administration of health insurance, and that none but trade unions should be allowed to administer benefits under the unemployment insurance scheme.Foreign Affairs.The statement on allied policy towards Russia which appeared in &quot; The Times &quot; of &quot;the 21st February does not receive much notice.  Mr. A. M. Thompson, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot;
the &quot; Nation,&quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; all conclude that the statement may be inter-.preted as a virtual declaration of peace. It is interesting to note that the &quot;Nation&quot; and Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; both regard the Constantinople ques-&apos; tion as a small matter, and see no reason why the Turkish Sultan should not be allowed to remain in Constantinople. The close liaison between the opinions of the &quot;Nation&quot; and certain contributors to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has been noted several times previously in this Report. Mr. W. McLaine and the &quot; New Age &quot; look forward to ever-increasing enmity between this country and the United States as a result of competition in export trade.Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The outstanding feature of the Labour situation is the growing indignation of Labour and the general public with the constantly increasing cost of living. A very large number of new wage demands are being made, mainly on the ground of the increase in the cost of living, but also with a view to obtain a share of the large profits being made in certain industries, and also to secure an improvement in the general standard of life.The problem of nationalisation, although the special Trades Union Congress to decide the form of action to be taken in the matter will be held next week, has receded somewhat into the background. The general trend of Labour opinion continues to set strongly against direct action to attempt to secure nationalisation, and it would appear that, although no doubt a heated debate will take place on the alternatives suggested by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the question is already regarded by Labour as decided.Survey of Industrial Disputes and Negotiations.As was anticipated last week, the Yorkshire painters&apos; dispute has terminated. Representatives of the operatives and the masters, backed in each case by members of their national organisations, met at Leeds on the 24th February and an agreement was reached. The men obtained acceptance of their claim to be paid the building trade, rate of Is. lid. an hour. There is considerable trouble in the Welsh steel trade, where the men have struck unofficially for payment of the 40 per cent, advance on basic rates granted recently to the tinplate workers. Employees at the works belonging to the Siemen&apos;s Steel Association came out on the 28th February, 16,000 men being immediately affected. It is estimated that if the stoppage continues, 20,000 tinplaters will also be involved, but it is understood that the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation is endeavouring to get the men to resume work and to submit the dispute to the Conciliation Board. With regard to threatened disputes, the outstanding cases are the bakers, who await the reply of the employers to their claim for increased wages, the tobacco trade workers, and the railway clerks, among whom considerable dissatisfaction with the recent settlement is being expressed. A serious dispute is threatened in the transport industry in connection with the claim of the commercial road transport workers for a general wage advance of 10s. a week. At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the industry held on the 2nd March the application was refused by the employers, and negotiations broke down. The employees&apos; side of the Council subsequently decided to ask the executives of the Unions affiliated to the National Federation of Transport Workers to authorise the.handing in of notices to strike. The position is rendered less serious, however, by the fact that the employers are not as a whole opposed to granting the increase, but have ref used to consider it at present on the ground that in some districts non-associated employers decline to be bound by decisions of the Industrial Council. Both parties have communicated with the Ministry of Labour, and a further meeting of the Industrial Council will be held early next week. In the meantime the National Executives of the Unions concerned are making arrangements to authorise local branches to hand in notices. The demand of tramway and omnibus men for advances in wages has also been considered by the Joint Industrial Council during the week, and a committee representative of both sides was appointed to investigate the question and report to the resumed Joint Industrial Council meeting, which is to be held on the 11th March. .
:TAe Unemployment Position.There was a total reduction of 17,675 in the number of H.M.F. policies remaining lodged on the 20th February compared with a reduction of 15,821 between the 6th and 13th February. The total number of H.M.F. policies remaining lodged on the 20th February was 306,284 for men and 4,314 for women.Unemployment books remaining lodged on the 20th February show a reduction of -5,319 during the week compared with a reduction of 8,648 during the previous week, books lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 20th February being 73,375 for men and 29,450 for women.At the 13th February 2,070. H.M.F. policies remained lodged by short time workers  chiefly in the engineering and ironfounding trades compared with 3,607 for the week ending the 6th February, 1920.Employment Exchange live registers at the 20th February showed 392,604 men, 53,902 women, and 23,432 juveniles, compared with 416,892 men, 51,791 women, and 24,590 juveniles at week ending the 13th February, and 443,085 men, 51,899 women and 25,497 juveniles at week ending the 6th February.The Nationalisation of the Mines.Although labour feeling generally appears to be against direct action to secure the nationalisation of the mines, very few actual indications of the policy to be adopted by the various unions at the special Trades Union Congress have yet been given. It is already clear, however, that even the miners will not he unanimous in voting for &quot; trade union action in the form of a general strike.&quot; The Northumberland Miners&apos; Council on the &apos;29th February, by 45 votes against 25, decided to instruct their delegates to the T.U.C. to vote in favour of direct action to enforce the nationalisation of the mines. A special council meeting of the Durham Miners&apos; Association will be held on the 6th March to decide upon instructions for their delegates. A circular has been issued to the lodges in which the alternative forms of action suggested by the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. are set out. The executive recommends the lodges that they should support political action in the form of intensive political propaganda in preparation for a general election. It is reported that in Lancashire and Cheshire opposition to a strike policy is steadily growing, and that the local miners&apos; executive would not sanction a strike on the question of nationalisation. And, in view of the recent utterances of Mr. Herbert Smith, president of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Associa-tion, in strong opposition to a policy of direct action, it may be expected that this important member of the Federation will be in favour of political action. The Cleveland Miners&apos; and Quarrymen&apos;s Association has issued a circular in which political action is advocated. The only non-mining union which has so far published its decision is the Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland, which has decided by 1,692 votes to 1,691 against direct action.The policy to be adopted by the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation is more uncertain, and the leading motives in that storm centre are somewhat obscure. It was stated in the -Report some weeks ago that the trend of opinion in South Wales was going against nationalisation and in favour of a demand for increased wages. In making this transition a somewhat acute argument has been developed. According to the contention of the South Wales miners, if the mines are not to be nationalised, they should be freed from control and should be in exactly the same position as any other private industry. In that case the profits of the industry could not be diverted to the National Exchequer, or applied, on behalf of the community, to reduce the cost of living, as the M.F.G.B. suggests. And ,as large profits are being derived from the South Wales area, the local miners claim that they have a right to an increased share in this prosperity.Possibly because of the development of this attitude in South Wales, the executive of the M.F.G.B. has decided to postpone any further decision as to the manner in which it will advocate that the surplus profits of the industry shall be utilised until a conference of the M.F.G.B. to be helcl on the 12th March, i.e., the day after the special Trades Union Congress. In the meantime, however, the executive has issued a statement to the effect that the Federation are now in a position to show that upon the actual ascertained data relating to the financial position of the coal industry there was no economic reason for increasing the price of inland coal by 6s. per ton in July last. They give figures of the present favourable financial position of the industry, and conclude &quot; In spite of this financial position, however, the Government refuse to reduce the price of industrial coal, and to establish the necessary machinery for reducing the cost of living in consequence of :such reduction.&quot;The Railways.With reference to the official support that Mr. J. H. Thomas and the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen are giving to the Bill of the London Electric Railway
Companies for increasing fares, it may be noted that resolutions opposing the decision of the N.U.R. executive to support this Bill have been passed by the Barking and Covent Garden branches of that union.The attribution by the Prime Minister of the delay in house building to the refusal of the building trade unions to accept dilution has produced a considerable amount of protest on the part of the unions. Mr. (x. Hicks, Secretary of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society, has issued a statement in defence of the attitude adopted by the unions in this, matter. He maintains that, in addition to the 55,000 bricklayers at present engaged in. all branches of the trade, there is a sufficient number of additional bricklayers available in the country to cope with the housing demand if only they could be persuaded to return to the trade with the assurance of proper conditions of work, including the guarantee of a full. week&apos;s wage during periods of bad weather. Mr. Hicks quotes figures to the effect that between 1914 and 1919, 25,000 bricklayers left the trade because it could not provide them with a livelihood, and he estimates that 20,000 of these are available at the present time if they can be induced to return to the industry. As to his first point, there is no doubt that a very large number of men left the building trade during the war to enter other trades that Avere at that time in a more prosperous condition. The Scottish Building Trades Wages and Conditions of Service Board has protested against what it names the recent uncalled-for attacks upon the trade by the Prime Minister and other Ministers. The Board declares that the attempt to place responsibility on the building trade for the neglect of discharged sailors and soldiers is an evasion by the employing class and the Government of the promises made to the men that the situations they left would be open to them if and when they returned. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress has called a special conference of building trade unions to discuss the whole, matter.Agriculture and the Hours of Employment Bill.In the Report for the week ending the 18th February (CP. 690), it was stated that, as a result of conferences between the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland,&apos;.&quot; an agreement has been reached as to the conditions under which, with adequate safeguards, agriculture may be included in the&apos; Hours of Employment Bill.&quot; This was a misstatement; the position is that at the conferences in question the Ministers concerned considered the conditions under which the Bill might be applied to agriculture if it were decided that agriculture should be included within the scope of the Bill.Prices and Profiteering.The indignation of labour and the general public at the increasing prices of com-modities continues to grow more intense. A strong protest against the inability of the Government to stop the increase in the cost of living was made by Mr. J. H. Thomas at a mass meeting of railwaymen at Southend on the 29th February. , Labour in general believes that profiteering is rampant, and the Profiteering Act is generally looked upon as a failure. Labour would probably be prepared to admit that the causes assigned by the President of the Board of Trade on the 26th February for the rise in prices sufficiently account for it, but it would alter the relative importance ascribed to these causes.. Labour, unfortunately, does not realise the important bearing on the matter of such factors as the fall in the commodity value of gold, paper inflation, and scarcity values, for these points are not obtruded on its notice; but the newspapers supply it with information about the large dividends of factories, department stores and multiple shops, and it has. some knowledge of the motives underlying stock-watering and over-capitalisation, and the reasons for the present great vogue of shares providing capital appreciation among investors. The result of all this is to deepen the suspicion in the mind of Labour that it is being exploited.Rumours have been current to the effect that a Labour campaign for the reduction in the cost of living is in preparation. Discussions on the matter&apos;have certainly taken place, but it is improbable that any movement will be hastily improvised. The matter may be raised as. an emergency resolution at the special Trades Union Congress on the 11th March, but on the whole it seems more probable that if any detailed scheme is suggested it will be the result of mature deliberation. The superficial and ill-considered miners&apos; memorandum on the subject which was adopted at the last Congress was not regarded,,
even by labour, as a real contribution to the solution of the problem, and if Labour intends to approach the problem again, it will, for the sake of its own reputation, seek to produce a more convincing scheme.Courts of Inquiry.The Court of Inquiry set up under the Industrial Courts Act to inquire into the application of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard minimum wage of 16s. a day and other alterations in the conditions of dock labour continued its sittings on the 25th, 26th and 27th February. On the 25th, Mr. H. K. Bubbear, chief assistant to the traffic manager at Bristol and Avonmouth Docks; Mr. C. H. Cox, a director of the firm of Messrs. 0 J. King &amp; Sons, master stevedores, Bristol; Capt. W. Fitt, marine superintendent for Messrs. Charles Hill k Sons, stevedores, Bristol; and Mr. W. Fenton, chairman of the Humber Employers&apos; Sub-Committee, gave evidence on behalf of the employers. The witnesses stated that the dockers tended to retard output through bad timekeeping, arriving late at the docks and leaving early, and through stoppages during negotiations on disputed questions. Mr. Bubbear, who quoted a few examples of unwarranted stoppages, admitted that there were other cases in which settle-ments were effected without stoppages, and that, in consequence of an arrangement made with the Dockers&apos; Union, the average number of disputes had been reduced. He also conceded that late arrivals of men at Avonmouth were due to unsatisfactory train services. In the opinion of Mr. Cox, a good deal of the bad timekeeping might be avoided, but he could not say that it was &quot; wilful.&quot; Mr. Fenton continued his evidence on the 26th, and further witnesses from the Hull district were Capt. Stonehurst, assistant dock superin-tendent for the Ellerman-Wilson Line, and Mr. Haseltine, managing director of Messrs. Scott, Ltd., wharfingers. On the 27th, Mr. J. S. Spencer, vice-chairman of the Glasgow shipowners and dock labour employers&apos; organisation, gave evidence. Regarding the wages claim, Mr. Spencer considered that if the wages demand was granted,, similar demands would be made in other trades. Mr. J. Macfarlane, treasurer of the Clyde Navigation Trust, gave evidence regarding the efficient and progressive administration of the Trust. Mr. Bevin protested that this evidence was irrelevant, but it was allowed by the Court; Sir Lynden Macassey arguing that such facts were necessary to refute the charges made by Mr. Bevin that all port authorities were reactionary and inefficient.Under the presidency of Mr. J. A. Compston, K.C., a Court of Inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act opened at the Chamber of Commerce Hall, Cardiff, on the 25th February, to investigate the hours and working conditions of coal tippers and trimmers. Statements on behalf of the men were made by Mr. Robert Williams and Mr. Walter Hudson, and evidence was- given.French Bureau of State Mines of the Saar.In consequence of the transference, under the Peace Treaty, of the coal mines of the Saar Basin to the French State, a Bill has been introduced to provide machinery for their administration and management. The provisions of this Bill are of peculiar interest in view of the nationalisation campaign in this country.In Article 2 of the Bill, it is provided that &quot; The Bureau shall be administered by a Board of fifteen Directors including nine representatives of the Ministerial Departments concerned, and six members appointed by the Minister in Control of Mines chosen as follows : Two from among the coal consumers, two among the operators of coal mines, and two from among French workmen or former workmen in coal mines. Deputy members may be appointed under the same conditions.&quot; Interesting features of the constitution of this Bureau are the representation accorded to consumers, the large proportion of Government directors on the Board, and the fact that only French workmen are represented, and thus German workmen have no say in the management of the mines.The introduction to the Bill points out that the duty of the Bureau will be to manage and work directly or indirectly the coal mines of the Saar, including the industries depend-ing on them, such as the works for the transformation of the coal into coke or electric energy. It insists that the Bureau must enjoy the greatest administrative and financial freedom in order to have the advantage of industrial and commercial conditions at least as favourable as those of a private enterprise. The introduction continues : &quot; We must be careful in particular to avoid the mistakes of the Prussian State in the Saar, which entrusted the management of the State mines to State officials, a plan which is fatal to the development and prosperity of an industrial enterprise, especially in the case of the
operation of mines. &quot;We must resolutely adopt industrial methods, especially in the matter of technical and commercial management. The Board of Directors of the Bureau, must, therefore, enjoy great independence and powers very similar to those of the governing, body of a private mining company. Its powers must be limited only in the matter of the issue of loans and the division of dividends. In all other matters it must have entire independence, naturally under the control of the Government, which may, as a penalty,, change the management.&quot; In spite, however, of this insistence on the &quot;business &quot; and independent character of the Bureau, the actual provisions of the Bill do not make it. clear in what respects it will differ from an ordinary Government Department.The French Railway Strike.The French railway strike which began on the 25th February was an expression of long-continued unrest ,precipitated by an otherwise insignificant incident, namely the-suspension for two days by the P.L.M. Eailway of a workman in the repairing shops at Villeneuve for going without leave to attend as a syndicalist delegate a congress at Dijon. The strike began as a sympathetic movement on the part of the railway shopmen, and on. the 24th February a mass meeting of employees of the P.L.M. Railway held at Lyons decided in favour of a general strike to begin at midday on the 25th February.  On the-24th February, the executive committee of the National Federation of Railwaymen con-sidered the situation and had an interview with the Minister of Public Works.  On the 25th February, the stoppage on the P.L.M. Railway was practically complete, but the extension of the strike to other railways was not general.    On the 26th February, M.. Millerand arrived in Paris from London, and received a deputation of the National Federa-tion of Railwaymen.  On the 27th February, a Cabinet Council took place, and the measures taken by the Government to cope with the situation were subsequently announced. These consisted in partial mobilisation to ensure the working of essential services and the&apos; provisioning of the country, and the issuing of various food and other orders.  On the evening of the same day the National Federation of Railwaymen declined to make any decision with regard to the strike, and referred the matter to the Federal Council, which consists of representatives of all the railways.  Late on the 27th February, the Federal Council declared a general railway strike for reasons of &quot; solidarity and dignity.&quot;  The Confederation Generale du Travail continued to deliberate on its attitude to the strike,, but before it reached a definite decision an agreement was reached as a result of negotia-tions with the Government, and on the 1st March the strike was proclaimed at an end. The most important terms of the settlement provide for the definition and recognition of trade union rights, the application of the scale of wages fixed by the Railway Federation,, and the holding of an immediate enquiry into the future management of the railway,, in co-operation with the C.G.T. and in particular its recently created Economic Council. Features of the strike were its unofficial origin, and the disinclination of the railwaymen&apos;s supreme authority to make it official, the hesitation of the C.G.T. to intervene, the general recognition that the strike was primarily the work of syndicalists and other-extremists, the relative apathy of the general public, and, the result, which promises a. general enquiry in which the question of nationalisation will be discussed.Trades Union Congress.. . The agenda of the special Trades Union Congress to be held at the Central Hall,. Westminster, on the 11th March, has been published. The Parliamentary Committee have made no recommendation as to the form of action to be taken, but put the matter in the form of an alternative. The agenda states, &quot; in view of the repeated refusal of the Govern-ment to nationalise the mines in accordance with the majority report of the Coal Corn-mission, and in agreement with the terms of the resolution passed at the Glasgow Conference and the special Congress in December last, the Parliamentary Committee suggest the&apos; following form of action, as a means to compel the Government to adopt the nationalisation of the mines : &quot; (1) Trade Union action in the form of a general strike.&quot; (2) Political action in the form of an intensive political propaganda in preparation for a general election.&quot; &quot; In the event of No. 1 being carried, the necessary steps will be taken to give effect, to it in accordance with the constitution of each union.&quot;Amalgamation.The Preston Weavers, Winders and Warpers Protection Society have decided by a ballot vote to amalgamate with the Preston and District Power Loom Weavers, Winders, and Warpers Association.  This amalgamation closes a dispute which arose when the.
Cotton Operatives&apos; trade unions decided to associate with the Labour Party and take part in political action. A separate association was formed against political action. This association has now joined the older association, which favoured political action. It is announced that an amalgamation between the Amalgamated Society of Pharmacists, Drug and Chemical Workers, and the National Association of Chemists&apos; Assistants is being arranged. The Executives of the Friendly Society of Ironfounders, the Associated Ironmoulders&apos; of Scotland, and the Amalgamated Society of Core Makers have refused to meet the sub-committee which is making arrangements for the amalgamation of the engineering unions; It will be remembered that this sub-committee addressed an invitation to the ironmoulders&apos; societies to join in the amal-gamation scheme for the engineering trades. It is reported that the moulders&apos; unions are considering a scheme of amalgamation between themselves, apart from the other engineering unions. They thus apparently intend to preserve the isolated position in which their action in withdrawing from the 1917 Agreement, and striking against the award of the Court of Arbitration, placsd them.Labour in the Municipalities.The movement of Labour Borough Councils in favour of securing that their employees shall belong to trade unions is increasing. The Camberwell Borough- Council has decided that all its employees shall belong to a trade union, and the Edinburgh City Council has agreed to allow the National Union of Corporation Workers to exhibit notices in all the works under the control of the Corporation inviting workpeople to join the union. In the Bow County Court on the 27th ult., Judge Graham gave judgment in the case brought by Mr. A. Willows against the Poplar Borough Council for wages of which, he alleged, the Corporation had deprived him, owing to the fact that he refused to join a trade union. Judgment was given for the defendants. - &apos;Trade Union Friction.The friction between the N.U.R. and the RCA. is being ventilated at present in their respective organs.  The &quot; Railway Service Journal,&quot; the official organ of the R.C.A., devoted more than four pages of its February issue to an attack on the N.U.R.  The writer in the &quot; Railway Service Journal&quot; is convinced that the N.U.R. is treating the R.C.A. unfairly, and acting in a way which is inimical to &quot; One Unionism.&quot;  In this article a history is given of the instances of friction between the two unions in the last twelve months, and the blame is always laid at the door of the N.U.R.  At great length the &apos;:&apos; Railway Service Journal &quot; maintains that the N.U.R., since the strike, has declared war on the R.C.A.  This war has taken the form of (a) condemning the R.C.A. for its attitude during the strike; (6) seeking to belittle and disparage the R.C.A. generally; and (c) opening for the first time branches for clerks and encouraging them to leave the R.C.A.   The &quot; Journal&quot; gives chapter and verse for its allegations, and makes out a strong-case against the N.U.R.  In the current issue of the &quot; Railway Review,&quot; this attack is vigorously repelled.  The &quot; Railway Review &quot; draws attention to the friction that has occurred between the two unions with regard to the position of supervisors.   It points out that at one time responsible officers of the R.C.A. attended meetings of supervisors and told them that the R.C.A. had an agreement with the N.U.R. to transfer them to the R.C.A.  The &quot; Railway Review &quot; alleges that the R.C.A. &quot; deliberately misled meetings of men and proceeded upon a campaign of wholesale poaching against the N.U.R.&quot;  It also points out that the R.C.A. had previously suggested that it should take over all supervisors and organise their movement, although at the time there were 7,600 super-visory members of the N.U.R. as against 2,500 of the R.C.A.  The &quot; Railway Review &quot; . points out that the N.U.R. is an industrial union, and accordingly accepts those of any grade within the railway service.  It has not made war upon the R.C.A., but if members of that union, who believe that the principle of sectional organisation is wrong, desire of their own free will to join the N.U.R., they can do so.It will be remembered that there was a considerable amount of friction also between the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. with regard to certain differences which arose in Ireland. It is reported in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; for the 27th February, however, that at a joint meeting of the executives of both unions held on the 18th and 19th February, a resolution was passed expressing pleasure that these differences, which were due to a misunder-standing, had been satisfactorily cleared up. Relations between the two unions do not yet, however, appear to be completely harmonious. Mr. J. Bromley, Secretary of the A.S.L.E. &amp; F., stated at Gateshead on the 29th February that his executive were not meeting the executive of the N.U.R. on the subject of a working agreement between the two unions.
With regard to the friction which is taking place in South Wales between the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, it may be noted that in the current issue of the A.S.E. Monthly Journal and Report, the Secretary, Mr. Tom Mann, devotes considerable attention to the question of the relation between the Miners&apos; Federation and the A.S.E. in the coal mining industry. He points out that the miners have been making praiseworthy efforts, in the interests of industrial unionism, to absorb all workmen working in or about the mines. Mr. Mann points out that, however admirable this policy may be, members of the-A.S.E. are employed to supervise the working of engines, dynamos and general electric plants at the mines and men who have originally gone to set up the engines remain on for months or for years, not as miners, but as engineers, and all the time their trade interests in a national sense are not at the mines but in the engineering centres of the country. &quot; If such men,&quot; he continues, &quot; who have ever been loyal to the principles and practices of trade unionism are suddenly called upon by an official of the Miners&apos; Federation to become members of the Miners&apos;Federation and be amenable to their instructions, and thereby to forego co-operation with their fellow engineers as loyal members of the A.S.E., it hardly requires explanation as to why this is not cheerfully complied with.&quot; He also points out that the rules of the society declare that a member must not be other than an honorary member of another union. The object of this, he says, is to secure consistent action, for if a man is a member of more than one union, and therefore liable to be called upon to pursue more than one policy at a time in a given dispute, the complexities are likely to be troublesome. These contro-versies show what difficulties still lie in the path of the development of industrial unionism.Ex-Service Men.Trade Unions and ex-Service Men. The Minister of Labour held an informal con-ference on the 1st inst. with representatives of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, and the Comrades of the Great War, for consideration of the question of the employment of ex-Service men. There was an interchange of views on the position of ex-Service men in relation to trade unions and industrial employment. It was unanimously agreed that the problem was one which required for its solution the full co-operation of the Government, employers, trade unions and ex-Service men, and it was decided to recommend the early formation of a National Committee, representative of these interests, which should have full powers to examine the matter and make recom-mendations.Mr. P. Doig, General Secretary, Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughts-men, has circulated a letter to the Press stating that his Association refused to assist in the Ministry of Labour&apos;s scheme for the training of draughtsmen because of the failure to drovide safeguards against under-payment on the conclusion of training.Comrades of the Great War. At the annual Grand Council Conference of the Comrades of the Great War, the scheme for the registration of the Comrades under the Companies Acts was unanimously approved. A letter was received from the Minister of Labour to the effect that proposals made by the Comrades to the Prime Minister in a. recent interview with the latter had been carefully considered. The Government have decided that a 50 per cent, disabled man should not be required in future to report to the Exchanges more than twice a week. Regular conferences between ex-Service men and Government Departments are to be arranged, and the development of training facilities is being pushed forward with all possible speed. Many of the Comrades&apos; speakers made it clear that they have no hostility to the trade unions, but expressed the wish that the latter would in some cases show a more considerate attitude, and hold out a helping hand to the unskilled ex-Service man.Woolwich ex-Service Men. A large number of ex-Service men marched from Woolwich on the 1st March to appeal to the Prime Minister to stop the discharges from the Royal Arsenal. A deputation of three, consisting of Mr. Fred Gildon (Secretary, the Woolwich Branch, National Union of ex-Service Men), Councillor Howarth (a member of the Branch) and Mr. J. Livingstone (National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers) proceeded to No. 10, Downing Street. The Prime Minister was unable to receive them, and they were seen by Mr. J. T. Davies, who announced on the Prime Ministers behalf that the discharges would be suspended until the 13th March, and that in the meantime, the War Office, Admiralty, and the Ministry of Munitions would set up joint Committees formed of official representatives and ex-Service men, to investigate the whole question and report. The deputation were unable to notify the result of their interview before the procession had come into conflict with the police.
* An account of the objects of the back-pay agitation was given in this Report for the fortnight ending the 31st December, 1919, p. 511.All inquir.es relating to this report should be addressed to: Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1,National Union of ex-Service Men. It is reported that the National Union of ex-Service Men launched a &quot; nation-wide back-pay campaign &quot;* on the 1st March, and has secured the assistance of prominent labour leaders. Midday meetings are to be held at factory gates and Employment Exchanges, and over 156 evening meetings have been arranged. 87 local Labour Parties, 36 Trade Councils and 879 Trade Union branches are stated to be assisting and co-operating in the campaign. Over 180 branches of the National Union are actively participating. In practice, however, the effect is smaller. The influence of this union, which has throughout its history been remarkable for its extravagant claims, is rapidly decreasing.International Union of ex-Service Men. The Annual Conference of this association has passed resolutions demanding the withdrawal of troops from Russia and Ireland, the release of political and military prisoners and the socialisation of industry.R. s.
