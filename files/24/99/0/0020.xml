(P 1438) From Viceroy, 20th February 1920. -(Received 21st, 10.45.jClear the line.202 S.   My telegram of 19th January, No. 80 S.   Letter to Amir.   Reply has now arrived clatetl 10th February:   Summary- is as followsQuestion of frontier tribes, as already mentioned, lies like deep gulf between the friendship of the two Governments, and requires early settlement, as sense of their rights is awakening in them because of feelings which, have affected whole of Islam. Tribes referred to are all those called Afghans, especially those like the Waziristan tribes, who have come under British control&apos; and (? concessions granted to) Indian people have raised great hopes in their hearts. Atnir-s former warning to discontinue hostilities against tribesmen have been justified by bad results in Waziristan. Tribesmen, especially neighbouring Wazirs, are out of sympathy with Mahsucls, starting from various places in Afghanistan with the intention of holy. Avar, but as no final decision has been reached between the two Governments, Amir is trying to restrain them. If war continues, and Mahsuds are subjected to great pressure, it will be impossible to restrain these tribesmen any longer. Early discussion will solve these&apos;difficulties. Regarding negotiations for treaty of friendship, Amir prefers to rely, on clear text of treaty of peace rather than on (? word omitted) and verbal discussions - between Grant and Ali Ahmad Khan. Provided complete independence and full rights of Afghanistan are secured, she is naturally inclined to be friendly with Great Britain and with all the Governments of the world. She specially wishes. to negotiate for permanent treaty of friendship. But of tests of friendship demanded by Grant, while some are fit for consideration, others &quot;are totally contrary to independence of our Royal Government.&quot;(R.) For instance, demand that Afghanistan shall not become focus of Powers hostile to the British. Afghan Government naturally desires its country to be focus of advancement. For this reason it first turned to British^ but fate Drought about misunderstanding. British could not (sic) have made Afghanistan focus of friendship for themselves, but missed their opportunity through not understanding extra- . ordinary kind of exultation of feeling aroused amongst the Afghans, &quot;British Government did not show us warmth of friendship that we should not become focus for others.&quot; iThere is still time, but if (corrupt group) speedy remedies are not considered, probably warmth of friendship will turn into coolness.As to demand for expulsion of Indian seditionists, persons mentioned have either come as guests or taken refuge Afghanistan.. Political refugees for (sic) this sort are found in every country, even in British capital, and their expulsion is not demanded. Why then should their expulsion be demanded from Afghanistan ? Afghan Government will, however, in case of peace prevent these refugees as far as possible from, acts unconnected educational or humanitarian work or from acts which affect British. Regarding Bolsheviks, Afghanistan was for long years in distress between Russia and Great Britain, former of which took Panjoch and Khushk, and latter still more extensive lands to south and east. -Events in Afghanistan after HabibulhVs death brought about war with British, and Afghanistan was naturally forced to turn to Russia, as no other great civilised Power was her neighbour. Afghanistan is now compelled to enter into relations with Russia (Li.) &quot;for purpose of protecting the rights of (?) especially Governments of Bokhara and Khiva.&quot; She wishes to serve Islamic world, and lias no enmity with those not interfering with her, but cannot be friendly with any Government which is enemy of her religion. She will establish friendly relations with any Government from which she expects material advantage and from which there is no danger to Islam. Afghanistan was bound to reciprocate honourable treatment accorded to her envoys by Russian Government. / ^If Aghan Consuls-General have said anything against British Government, it was probably in time of war, and Grant similarly, made statements to which Afghanistan jnight take exception.Finally, Amir says that he shares my desire to remove the difficulties, mis-understandings and preparing *\vay for permanent friendship. Delay is harmful, and early discussions should take place which he strongly hopes will end in permanent treaty of friendship. He has nominated certain representatives and awaits informa-tion from me as to my nominees and time and place of meeting.
(R.) &quot; Naturally, I consider it proper that friendly discussions and conclusion of permanent treaty should take place at capital of Your Excellency&apos;s Government in England, so that no&apos; doubt or misgiving may be left, and swear (corrupt group) finally (? on the spot). In order that I may know (? these) verbal discussions have &quot;been proposed with sincere intentions, Your Excellency might stop in a proper manner hostile movements against frontier of Afghans.&quot;Reverting to question of frontier tribe(s), Amir assures me after enquiry there is no truth in allegation that rations and money were sent to Wana. Afghan officers have never engaged in such instigations. If there have been secret instigations anywhere, these are&apos; clue to the violent national feelings which have affected all Afghan tribes. As to his allowances to representatives of frontier tribes (R) &quot; from time of my grandfather and father (? these) poor tribes have been (? coming to) Kabul, their place of refuge, and Islamic centre (corrupt group) receiving allowances and rewards for coming, to see their Muhammadan King. This time also, during war with Afghanistan, they- expressed their Islamic sympathy and. gave help. In the same hope.they canie to Kabul, the place of their refuge, and having congratulated me on my independence, Ay ere given medals and rewards.&quot;Style of letter apart from contents is temperate and, on the whole, less imperti- . vnent than that of many communications from Kabul.   Regarding penultimate passage in quotation marks Foreign Secretary has ascertained from Afghan envoy that he &apos; reads it as meaning that Amir would like both discussions to clear any misimder-standings and final friendship negotiations to take place in London, and is also urging that hostilities against Waziristan tribes should cease pending discussions but does not mean to put these forward as definite stipulations.   Most notable point in letter is perhaps omission of any assurance that Afghanistan will not be used as focus for Bolshevik (? intrigues) and propaganda against India, whereas assurance is given against such propaganda by Indian seclitionists.   Letter, however, is apparently meant to make it plain that Amir has not yet concluded definite agreement with. Bolsheviks and that it is still open to us to outbid them.   Mention of Amir&apos;s desire &apos;to protect rights of Bokhara and Khiva is very significant in view of recent information from authentic sources that Moscow is against leaving these Governments autonomous, and we might be able later, if thought desirable, to make use of AimVs , aspirations in this quarter.   Other points are that Amir associates himself entirely with general Moslem aspiration and wishes to maintain position that, under doctrine of self-determination, all Pashtu-speaking tribes of the frontier should be allowed to come under his sovereignty.   It seems fairly clear that he is anxious to make friendly agreement if lie can get some concession out of us and save his face with tribes ; but it does not seem likely he can be induced to abandon relations with Bolsheviks. , Algkan envoy says that it is practically certain that Nadir Khan, who is truculent person, will be head of Afghan delegation.   Amir&apos;s letter (? does not seem to) call for detailed reply except on point of proposed conference.   With regard to discussion, I propose Dobbs should be my principal representative, but have not yet decided who should assist him.   As.to place of conference, I consider Lucknow most suitable. Atmosphere of Lucknnw with preponcleratingiy Shiah population and strong influence of loyal talukdars, is calculated to make good impression on Afghan delegates,   I propose, therefore, to reply immediately as follows : &quot; I am glad Amir welcomes idea ; of a conference for the purpose of clearing away misunderstandings and preparing way for a subsequent treaty of friendship, and I am prepared to arrange&apos; for such a conference on such conditions without delay.&quot; Names of my principal representatives will then follow. As to place of meeting, I have come to the conclusion that Lucknow is most commodious and convenient, and as soon as I have heard from the Amir names of his representatives and number of party accompanying them, and probable date of arrival, I will give orders for preparations to be made at Lucknow for their accommodation. I hope that his delegates may be persons who are in fullest enjoyment of his confidence, so that there may be no doubt as to their being able^o convey his real wishes and sentiments of -(? Amir&apos;s) Government.&apos;- Further, as conference now to take place will be for the purpose of (? preliminary) discussions, Amir will no doubt agree with me in view &apos; that all that is necessary is for two or three ^representatives from each side to meet in frank and friendly manner, and that no large delegation seems called for.&quot;I will telegraph after receipt of your reply further comments on the situation in detail.
