I submit the following to the Cabinet and in. view of its urgency I ask for an early decision.J L.W0RTHINGT0N EVANS.19th February 1920.SECOND $PSCIAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON PENSIONS.In July, 1919, the Select Committee submitted a report dealing with the pensions of men and. their widows.   Their recommendations were in the main accepted by the Cabinet and approved^ by the House-&apos; of Commons and hava been embodied in a Royal Warrant. In their Second Report, of which a copy is attachedhe re t o s the Committli b !h1 with the pensions ofthe dependants of men (Pare I) and the pensions of Officers and. their dependants (Part II).It will be convenient to take the proposals of the Committee seriatim aid to indicate the decision I recommend on each.   An estimate of the immediate annual costjle.;,.wherever possible, shown in the margin against each supported recommendation.PART I - DBPKHDANT)S&apos;PENSIONS (MEN)Paragraph 6 (.1) - Parent s&apos; Flat Rat e j?ension (5&apos;/-) * I agree&apos; that the flat-rate pension cannot -be withdrawn, and must be retained, but without increase.Lima ted additional Paragraph 10 - parents &apos; Pre-War Dependence andInual cost Special,Pensions.      I, support the recommendation lire-War Dependency lentoi lT&quot;tliarThe &quot;maximum limit of parents : pre-war 30,000    . dependence and special pensions should be raisedbrents&apos; Special Pensions from 18/- (i.e. 15/&apos;- plus 20 per cent bonus) to 45,000 20/-, but I do not support the recommendation thatItaing eventually to a lower amounts should be raised 33 per cent inch figure, the &apos; proportion.   The cost would amount to  600,000 andfount of which depends the wcrk of reassessing the 300,.000 parents&apos; pensionsIon future conditions now in issue would break the pensions machinery.Old Age Pensions and The present position is t : t the pension is de-ft of living.It &quot;may termined according to pre-war dependence or need,ten  500,000.)l-al 1isent cost  75,000and to the amount so fixed a bonus of, 20. per cent is added.   (Under the Warrant of &quot;6th December 1919 the bonus was made a substantive part of the pension).   I consider that this provision .1s generally sufficient.   It.must be remembered that the support given by the son before the war, which forms the basis of the dependence pension; was extremely insecure, and, apart from other even-tualities such,as loss of employment, would almost certainly have been withdrawn or materially reduced on the scn&apos;s marriage.   To exchange this hazardous support for a permanent Stats-guaranteed pension is, I think, more than sufficient compensation for the depreciation of the purchasing-power of money in excess of the 20 per cent for which pro-vision is already made.j
For the reasons stated above, I do not consider that an automatic increase of the parentss pensions now in payment is justifiable, but, I should be prepared to meet the Select Committee with regard to such special cases as are instanced in (II), (IV) and (V) of their recommenda-tions under this paragraph.   Already the Special Grants Committee can give some effect to these recommendations and it would need but a slight amendment of their existing Regulations to enable them to deal with all cases of special hardship, on the basis suggested by the Select Committee, namely, &quot;reasonable expectation of what the son would have contributed had he lived&quot;.   If and in so far as the recommendation under (ii) goes beyond ^ts&quot;f&apos; do not think we can give effect to it.   The amended Regulations will have to be carefully worded if the Special Grants Committee are not to be deluged with applications, the great majority of which they will find it impossible to accept, and I should therefore deprecate any premature announcement of concessions under this head, but I ask the Cabinet to accept the broad principle of recommendations (II), (IV) and (V) of paragraph 10 and to allow me to arrange the details of the amended Regulations with the Special Grants Committee.With regard to the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that &quot;in the case of two parents, provided need is proved, the limit should be raised to 40/-&quot;, the Special Grants Committee can already supplement parents&apos; pensions limited by the Warrant to 2o/-, by a further 10/- which I now propose to increase to 15/-.   I think this should meet the case.I have not referred to recommendation (iii) because it has been anticipated.   Where the soldier!s mother and her younger children were being maintained by the soldier before his enlistment the Ministry treat the young brothers and sisters as though they were the soldier&apos;s children and pension them accordingly.General Review of parents  Pensions.   I,cannot support the further recommendation in paragraph 10 that there should be a general review, by Local Tribunals, of all parents5 pensions.   I regard this as absolutely impracticable.   The awarding of the parents&apos; pension now in payment (over 300,, 000 in number) was a task which engaged the whole-time -services of a staff of experienced officials for a period of 4 years, and to attempt ( and complete within any reasonable time) a review of these awards would be physically impossible - at least, if the work were entrusted, as it should be, to persons conversant with the principles of award and mentally equipped to give decisions which will be&apos;binding upon the&apos;State for the pensioners lifetime.   The practical result of the Committee&apos;s recommendation would be to turn third arid fourth grade officials into final judges and to deprive them of the advice of the first and second grade officials who now control their work.
I do, however, propose to re-arrange the       JQ scale by which need is now judged,   I propose-to raise the scale so as to provide more adequately for present need of dependants.p&amp;rMFi^jiiill &quot;* ignsions gg 0ther Dependants -These &quot;other dependants11 who are brought in under Article 22 of the Warrant, are those not specifically provided for in other clauses of the Warrant.   To be eligible for pension under this clause the applicant (most frequently a sister or invalid brother of the soldier) must prove both prer enlistment dependence and present need and in-capacity for self-support.   In the present Warrant there is a maximum of 16/6d, being 13/9 plus 20   per cent.   This maximum is merely a survival from the &quot;Hodge&quot; Warrant, and was only retained in the present Warrant provisionally, pending the Select CommitteeJs Report *   It was originally fixed at l3/9d because that was the minimum widowfs pension and it was felt that no &quot;other dependant&quot; should receive more than a widowc   The Select Committee recommend raising the maximum to 18/4.   Following the principle on which the rate was originally fixod, I suggest that the maicini.ua be raised to 20/-, that being now the minimum rate of widow&apos;s pension/ As this figure is only a maximum, and the oases are. few, the cost of the increase will be negligible.Paragraph 11(B) - Adoption of Sliding Soale *   The Coiiilttee recommend the adoption of&apos; thel&amp;tding Scale introduced into the Warrant as the result of their First Report, &quot;subject to the present rates under the &quot;Hodge&quot; Warrant being the minimum&quot;.   I agree to the adoption of the Sliding Scale but would observe that the minimum must be the &quot;Hodge&quot; Warrant rates plus the 20 per cent bonusf where this is now payable.   The bonus is made a sub-substantive part of the pension in the new Warrant, and no provision is made for its ultimate withdrawal.Limitation on the number of pensions payable in respect&apos; of one man. I. agree ^lih vas.&quot; Sokect Committee!s recommendation in regard to dependants   pensions, v that, &quot;they should be based on &quot;need&quot; broadly inter-preted as the amount which the man would reasonably have been expected to contribute had he lived&quot;, but this recommendation reveals a serious flaw in the present Warrant inasmuch as there is no limit to the number of pensions that may be payable in respect of one man although there is obviously a limit to what he could have done for his dependants if he had lived.   For example, in addition to the widow who obtains a flat&quot;rate or alternative pension on account of the man&apos;s death, either or both parents, if living, may obtain pensions whether he contributed to their support or not, and, at the samo time, any other person or persons to whom he was making any contribution at the time of his enlistment may similarly draw a life pension, if in need.   This opens out a serious addition to the Statefs liability in future as the parents grow old and claim pensions based on need or incapacity for work.   I propose to meet this difficulty by limiting the aggregate amount of pension which may be payable to dependants other than a widow and children in respecUof one man, to an amount equalto
to the \vidowfs flat*rate pension (that is, 20/-) where he loaves a pensionable widow, except in the case of two parents-.Who either were both entirely dependent ori the man or are in need,   k limitation of this kind &apos;is&quot; already in force in the case of Officers&apos; Dependants.^ra^ragh^ 14* - Statutory rl-.ht to. pension f car&quot; widows &apos; and dependant s of, officers and men. I. think -that The? Statutory right may be&quot;extended to widows and motherless children (who - already have right of -appeal to the new, Pensions appeal Tribunal) 021 the same terms as ft is given to officers and men by- . the War Pensions (Administrative Provisions) Act 1919 - that is. that the right is in each case to the pension awarded, subject to the conditions of the Warrant.do&quot; not propose to extend, this statutory -right to pension to dependants, because the-grant , of a pension to them is determined, not/alone by the circumstances.of the man &apos; s&apos;death, but on other factors, such, as pre-war dependence-,- need, &quot;in-.  -capacity, for work and--age..  Moreover to give de-pendants a statutory right, to pension would necessarily involve the further right of appeal,, but even if an appeal succeeded on the question, of attributability,: the claimant might - still find him or herself ineligible for pension on other grounds.The.recommendation as to administrative improvements in the last sentence-of paragraph 14 has been anticipated, and in future officers will have the same advantages in the-matters referred to as have men.garagraphs 16..*. 17. Temporary Officers 1 Disability Scales*.    The Committee&apos; shew IE?t. the present scales with&quot;the bonus&apos;compare fairly with the. revised rates&apos;for men.   They - would therefore retain them, definitely adding the bonus but making it subject to,adjusttnent according to cost of living, as is 20% of the men&apos;s new rates.   I sup port this re-commendation.Paragraphs 18-24. - JJlsability Scales of Regular Of officer-s^,   The Committee&quot;&apos; ^proposal, put shortly, is &quot;i&quot;o&quot;i&apos;ike the new service sca 1 es as a basisj dr0p the bonus;, increase the disablement -addition, by 50$ J make the disablement addition,, as well as the .basis, liable to adjustment up to %Q$,, and allow the new half-pay rates as a minimum.I agree with the Committee&apos;s view that it is desirable, and convenient to adopt the new Service.. Scales as the basis.. This involves reconsidering the addition to be made for disablement be cause (1) in the great majority of eases, - i\e. majors, Captains, and Subalterns of the Army arid, air force;-the basis at present taken is a scale in the 1914&quot;&apos;. &apos; Pay Warrant, which contained a substantial dis-ablement element, and was distinguished from the pure service scale on an average by nearly  50 ayear.
Estimated additional annual cost  10,000*Estimated additional annual cost  6/000.Estimated additional annual cost  3,500.The additional cost cannot at present be forecast; but it should not exceed  5,000 per annum.year, (2) the basic rate under the 1914 Pay Warrant is not reducibloj whereas the new service scale may be reduced in time by 29;% which would in some instances bring it materially below the present basis, (3) the cost-of-diving element in the new service rates, varying with the length of service and rank, may be worth less to junior officers of fairly short service than is the present disability bonus, which is to disappear.   rX&apos;he Committee&quot;s proposal to increase the disablement addition from  100 to  -150 (maximum) is therefore rea sonable.The proposal (paragraph 22) to allow the new and much increased half pay rates as a mimMum permanent pension stands by itself.   It will, most benefit officers of relatively short service with slight disablements.   But it has to be remembered that the Regular ufficer when invalided loses his profession, and should therefore enjoy for life compensation at the rates decided by the Service Departments as appropriate for half-pay.I think that the disablement addition should be reducible by 20$, and not by  20 as proposed at the end of the second part of paragraph 23.   With this slight modification I support all the re-commendations contained in paragraphs 18 - 24 of the Report.  .Paragraphs 25 - 50&apos;. Disability Scales of Temporary Off icers in receipt of gisabjllty Tensions as Men.&quot;The Committee&quot;*proposeTparagraphs 25 - 27]&quot;to &apos; take the new service rates as a basis^ to drop -the bonus, and to increase the disablement, addition to  150, as for the Regular. Officer.Though the technical grounds for the increase are less strong in this case, I support the proposal because (l) as the Committee shew, there has been considerable demand for the fuli disability rate of the officer ( 175) added to the service pension of the soldier, and the increase from  100 to  150 goes a long way to meet this) (2) these ex-soldiers Yfere to a great extent the backbone of the Hew Armiesj and (3j the increased cost is small about  3,000 a year.The Committee also .wish (Paragraphs 28 - 30) to ensure that a man who would have attained to a permanent pension had he remained in the ranks and been pensioned as a soldier shell not forfeit that benefit because he took a temporary Commission and was disabled as an officer.   This seems just, and I support it.&apos;  It is not known how many men will benefit by this proposal, but they cannot be very numerous.Paragraph 31.   WouMJ?ensions* The first re- , comneTidaEIon   is &quot;&quot;re -&quot;consideration for the future of the present unsatisfactory system of wound pensions.   This is a matter for inter-departmental action and calls for no immediate do-oialon.
OI propose, however, to simplify the presentitimated additional cost in 1920 - 21  150,000.atimated additional jimual cost -  54(1)......... 6,600Increasing eventually o  10,000 per annumj&apos;&amp;(ii) ........32,0004(iii)  ....... 1,500i4(iv)  ........15,000noreasing eventuallyo  30,000)     _^Total       55,100ucreasing eventually o a total of  73,500)administration of wound pensions in the case of Officers entitled after discharge to disability retired pay in addition to the wound pension.   At present the wound pension under the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916, 5s administered by the Service Departments while disability retired pay is administered by the Ministry of tensions.   I propose that in the case of Officers entitled to wound pension in respect of service in the Great War that pension shall be administered &quot;by my Department as soon as the officer is invalided or demobilised from the service; this requires legislation and I propose to Insert a clause to this effect in a War Pensions Bill which I am now promoting.The recommendation at the end of this paragraph, that the bonus where it is added to the sum of the wound pension and the 1914 rate (usually half pay), should be calculated not on that sum but on the lesser scale of disability retired pay for sickness, appears to be&apos; sound in theory.   But when the bonus was introduced the more liberal method was adopted in wounds cases, and I am not prepared to recommend any reduction, even after the expiration of current awards.Paragraph 32 - Wife&apos;s Allowances. The Committee recommend that If an officer applies he should be granted, an allowance&apos;of  50&quot;&quot;f or &quot;his wife if he is in receipt of retired pay for total disablement with proportionate rates for lesser degrees of disablement, and at the same time they propose that the Special Grants Committee should be em-powered to supplement the allowance up to a maximum of  50 where a lower rate is being paid by the Ministry.   I do not altogether agree with this recommendation.   On the one hand, if supplementation of a wife&apos;s allowance is recog-nised in the case of officers, it will be demanded in the case of men.   On the other hand, the Committee say themselves, &quot;it is clearly undesirable to pay allowances to those who do not need them&quot; and presumably with this object they suggest application by the officer as a condition of the grant in the first instance.   On the whole, I am of the opinion that the wifels allowance within the proposed maximum of  50, like other allowances (e.g, education and maintenance allowances for children) additional to the pension in the case of the officer should not be paid as a flat-rate but should be administered entirely by the Special Grants Committee on the basis of    -need.Ulowances   The&quot;the limits the SpecialParagraph 34 . Children^ Committee propose certain increases of of the maintenance allowances given by Grants Committee and of the education allowances both under the Warrant and under the Special Grants Committee Regulations.I support these increases as being fully warranted in view of the increased cost of living and of s/jhooling.Paragraph 35. Alternative Retired Pay of Officers. For men pre-war earnings ha ve&apos; be en &quot;\ oad ed&quot; &quot;up&quot;.  by
estimated additional nrmal cost  26,000stimated annual ost  10,000by Q0%, and full earnings allowed up to 100/- a week instead of full earnings to 50/- and half earnings between 50/- and ICO/-,   A; similar change should be made for officers.Before the Committee reported, I had made proposals to the Treasury^ and the Treasury had made ccunter-pro^proposals.   There are therefore three schemes for consider&amp;eration *w Ministry of Pensions (previous&apos; propbsal) full earnings up to  450, loaded by(2) Treasury - full earnings to  500, plus half earnings between  30.0 and  600 (as -at present,) leaded by 60$,Select Committee - full earnings to  500, loaded by 60?7It is very difficult to forecast the cost of any of these schemes, but it has been calculated that, as compared with the present cost, they may be (1)  37,000, (2)  26,000, (3)  55,000*   The extra cost for widows (paragraph 40) has to be added.The Select Committee, in proposing a maximum of  500 were following the formula of doubling the menfs limitsJ but this has not the same validity in regard to a pension based on pre-war earnings.The Treasury1s objection to full earnings beyond  300 is that salaries above that amount have not increased in proportion to wages.   There is some force in this objection, and I am prepared to advise the acceptance of the Treasuryfs scheme.At (iii) of paragraph 35 it is recommended that service retired pay and service pension of which an officer or man was in receipt before the war should be reckoned as part of his pre-war earnings, being in the nature of deferred, pay, and not as income only.This is a highly technical point, but legal opinion is against regarding, service retired pay as anything but income, and the change, if made in regard to officers would have to be applied to their widows and to the widows of men of non-commissioned rank, and this would mean a sub-stantial,addition to the cost.   Moreover, the Select Committee^ proposal would not in all cases benefit the officer, and would be actually to the direct disadvantage of the man, because if the service pension formerly payable is to be regarded as pre-war earnings the higher rate of service pension now payable must be regarded as present earnings and the alternative pension must be reduced accordingly.   On the other hand, I recognise that tnere are cases where a Regular Officer lived before the war on his retired pay and having been killed in the war leaves a widow materially reduced in circumstances, and I propose that these cases should be&apos; met by allovdLng the Special Grants Committee to supplement the flat--rate pension up to  200 in the case of widows of Regular Officers who were drawing service retired pay before the war..

The scale of mecuis by wh:\ch need is to be judged will be approved by the Ministry of tensions).The recommendation at B0 (top of P.14) to give a rather w:l&apos;if:t- &apos;l::.m:Vl, for supplementation by the Special Grants Committee where there are children is reasonable.

In the case of men this mimimum is 25/-which with 60% equals 40/-J in the case of officer? it should be  132, which with 60$ equals  215.Paragraph 41 o Motherless Children. The Committee appear, through*a slight confusion, to have reckoned the bonus twice.   They have proposed (para.33) to raise the normal rate of child s allowance from  24 plus bonus of  4.16.0. *  28.16.0. to  30 plus bonus of  &amp; a  36.   The corresponding increase for motherless children should be from  40 plus bonus of  8 to  50. plus bonus Of  10 *  60 (not  60 plus  12 *  72), and I recommend accordingly.I support the proposal to allow the Special Grants Committeejto givg allowances, up to  40 a year to motherless, children of officers not eligible for pensions under the Warrant.   The cases will be lew.I further propose that the Special Grants Committee should be empowered to supplement an existing pension of a motherless child up to the limit of an additional  40 a year in suitable cases (as e.g. where the mother would have been entitled, if she had survived, to a substantial alternative pension, or survives and dies when in receipt of such pension).Paragraph 42.   Relatives of officers.   The first recommendation (third sub-paragraph  can be carried out administratively,The second recommendation (fourth sub-paragraph) as to the limit of pension 4s not quite sound.   It ought not to be possible for the parent to receive a higher pension that the widow (the two-thirds rate not being proposed for all widows).   I propose instead that the limit for the parents  pension should be that proposed to be taken for tie widow without children, i.e. present highest rate plus 20$ or present intermediate rate plus 2Q$The third recommendation (last sentence oh P.14) is unnecessary, as I Already have Treasury sanction to add  56 in this class of case where there is a second surviving parent.The fourth recommendation (top of P.15) as to admitting a sister, if otherwise qualified) on death of a pensioned parent, is fair and reasonable, and I support it.

The Committee propose nochange &quot;for the&quot; temporary Warrant Officers; but the bonus will be definitely added to the pension.For Regular Warrant Officers, the much-increased service rates provide for the increased cost of living, but the Committee propose that the disablement ad-ditions should be slightly increased. I agree with this, on the understanding of course that the rates so arrived at will be subject to adjustment according to cost of living,but not below their present level.The Committee have omitted to- propose a wife-Is allowance for Na-vud, Warrant Officers.    If such an allowance is approved for officers, it must be given to fitaval Warrant Officers also.   I recommend that such an allowance be given, up to a maximum rate of  40 a year, for Commissioned Naval Warrant officers and  30 for other Naval Warrant Officers,.and that the Special Orants Committee have power to supplement to those amounts in partial disability cases.Paragraph 46. - Widowsjarid Children of Naval Warrant Officers&apos;. The widow &quot;of a Chief &quot;Petty &quot;&quot;Off icer &quot;with criictren now receives  86.13.4 a year, and the widow of the Sub-Lieutenant with children,will, as I propose, receive  120 a year.The Committee recommend that the widow of the Commissioned Naval Warrant Officer over 40 or with children be granted  102 and of the Warrant Officer  90.estimated addit lone. 1 inual cost  7,500.I prefer rates reducible by 20% and therefore suggest  105 and  90.The scheme would then be:-Widow of Commissioned (Over 40 or with children  105 Naval Warrant Officer (under 40 &amp; without &apos;&quot;       90Widow of Naval Warrant Officer(Over 40 or with children    90(under 40 &amp; without 75.estimated additional lual cost -!s children  7,000 low^      &quot;    13,500 therless 11        500Imated additional 1&apos;ial cost  13,000.The rates for children must be Increased to bring them above the improved rates for seamen children.

It appears to me that compensation should be provided for them, and I propose that the War Office should deal with them.Paragraph 52.   Limits of bonus and pen sion*   When a bonus was approved&apos;for officers and their families early in ,1919 the Scheme contained certain total limits of pension and bonus combined, above which no bonus should be given,, e.g*,  300 for a disabled officer,  200 for an officers widow,  175 for a Naval Warrant Officer.There were no such limits for men and their relatives, and 1 think that when scales inclusive of a cost-of-living element are devised, the limits for officers and their relaitivcs must disappear.Almost the only case in which a bonus will have to continue to be added as a separate item is that of an officer with a wound pension and a 1914 rate of disability retired pay (usually the half pay rate)&quot;   In these cases I think the  300 should continue to operate, especially since I am (as I have said) unable to support the Committee&apos;s proposal to reduce the bonus in paragraph 31.I agree with the Committee that no bonus should be added to alternative pensions after the pre-war earnings have been loaded upcParagraph 53 a   !?J ^iLlr pffleers in India, 0 I have again^taken&quot;up the sublect with the&apos; War Office, pressing them to adopt the suggestion of the Sele ct C ommltt e e e ^r^  ?: ^J^:g   Income-tax exemption.

To a very great &quot;extent &quot;the improved rates granted to officers and men an3 tHeir dependants in the present War&quot; have already been conceded to previous-war pensioners.   Wife1 a allowance has, hovfever, not been granted, and on the whole&apos; I am not disposed to recommend it.   If granted, it would have to be -subject to the same oondltion as applies to wife1a allowance for the late war, namely, that the marriage took place before the man*s disablement.   This distinction has been vigorously assailed in its application to the late war, and, at this distance of time would be very difficult to maintain for former wars as it would Involve disqualifying wives married, perhaps, 30 or 40 years ago..There is, however, a small improvement, which could be effected in the positioner widows of former, wars at trifling cost and    . without danger of complication or reaction on other classes of pension.

The Treasury were recently asked to,sanction the grant of rank pensions, for widows of non-com-missioned officers, but refused, apparently on the ground that the present rates of pension,&apos; &apos;as for a privatels widow, were sufficiently generous.   In view of the Select Committee^, recommendation, I ask - the Oabinet to say that the widow of a non-commissioned officer billed in a former war should receive the pension appropriate. to her late husband (s rank, under the Warrants relating to the late war.-. ;Date of Ope^tiOn^of^New^Raiss;/If the hew rates are antedated it will /)4u*Awv. involve considerable/of the work of the ministry and I should propose4 therefore the 1st April as the date of . commencement.

Committees in Appendix.See Memo, of Association of L.W.P. Committees.1. The Select Committee appointed to enquire and report upon the past method of administering the Pensions Acts and Warrants and what steps, if any, are necessary for the removal and prevention of legitimate grievances, have further considered the matters to them referred, and have agreed to the following Second Special Report.The Committee have held 24 further Meetings and have heard additional evidence from representatives of the Pensions Ministry, the Ministry of Labour, the War Office, the Admiralty, and other Government Departments, of Local War Pensions Committees, of Voluntary Associations, representative of Officers, their Wives, Widows and Families; and also of similar associations repre-sentative of N.C.O.S and Men.2. The Committee have been unable to conclude the hearing of all the necessary evidence, but have agreed to the following Second Special Report.The Report deals with the following: Part I. Dependants&apos; Pensions (Men).Part II. Officers&apos; Pensions, including Wives, Widows, Children and Dependants; and Nurses&apos; Pensions.Part III. Treatment and Training.Part IV. Disability and Death in previous wars (Officers and Men).PART I.-Dependants&apos; Pensions (Men).3. (A.) Pensions of Parents. At present there are three Pensions payable to parents who have lost sons in the war: (i.) A 5s. flat rate payable (generally on application only*), and to any parent who has applied irrespective of need or dependency. The 20 per cent. Bonus does not apply. This flat rate 5s. was first granted in November, 1918.The grant is limited : (a) To Parents of sons under 26 at mobilisation or enlistment.(b) And who were unmarried and left no pensionable children dependants.(c) The award dates from 6th November, 1918, or the date of application if after the 31st March, 1919, or the date on which the man would have attained the age of 18 years if later.&quot;Those in receipt of this 5s. flat rate Pension number approximately 75,000. (ii.) Pre - War Dependency.   These cases number above 220,000.- Under the Hodge Warrant (17th April, 1918) the rate varies from 3s. 6d. to 15s., or up to 15s. each for two parents, i.e., 30s. if the parent had two sons serving.  No need or incapacity need be proved, but only the fact of dependence up to the moment of enlistment. This Dependency Pension carries at present Avar bonus of 20 per cent.(iii.) Parents&apos; Special Pensions.Here (a) Total or partial incapacity from age or infirmity; and (b) Pecuniary needmust be proved. The Amount varies from 3s. 6d. to 15s.This Parents&apos; Special Pension carries at present war bonus of 20 per cent. The number of cases in receipt of this Special Pension are about 22,000.4. The evidence before the Committee showed considerable divergence of opinion as to the proper method of dealing with Parents&apos; Pensions. The Council of Local War Pension Committees, at the suggestion of the Chairman, circularised their various Committees and asked for their views,Evidence from this and from other quarters shows that the present Triple system is by many not only of those who engaged in Pension administration, but of those who receive the Parents&apos; Pension, considered complicated and not satisfactory. But on the other hand, the needs of each case vary so much, and so many uncertain factors have to be considered, e.g., the differences involved in the varying circumstances of each household, in the varying amount of need, in the varying contributions made by sons before enlistment, &amp;c, that any one single system of Parents&apos; Pensions seems out of the question.5. We have considered various proposals for simplification of the Parents&apos; Pension, but on the whole we are of opinion that the present threefold system does roughly cover the need, and, subject to the recommendations which we make below, should be continued. It is difficult to diminish or rearrange on any general plan pensions now being paid, and which the recipients have learnt to look on as in their nature permanent.6. (i.) The Flat Mate Pension. Generally, it is felt that this 5s. flat rate pension should be regarded, not as financial compensation for the loss of a son, but as a recognition by the State of the sacrifice made.  Some evidence was put before us in favour of its total abolition, on the ground* In some cases, eg., where a lower pension of 3s. 6d. is already payable, the parent need not apply.
that no monetary compensation can ever be adequate in such a case, and being available lor practically all parents, however well off, it is now applied for and received by many parents who do not need it. And some members of the Committee favoured its abolition, but on the express, condition that all cases where the flat rate is now paid should be reviewed, and where need can be shown the full amount of such need should be met up to a limit of 20s., the fiat rate to be retained till such revision had taken place. On the other hand, other evidence was in favour not only of retaining the 5s. fiat rate, but of increasing it to 7s. 6d. We recommend that it be retained, subject to the carrying out of our recommendations for revision suggested in para. .10 below. If those proposals are adopted it would be open to all parents who have lost sons in the war to claim revision and adjustment of pension on the basis of need broadly interpreted, i.e., on the basis of reasonable expectation of what the son Avoulci have contributed had he lived. It must be borne in mind that the 5s. fiat rate pension was only instituted so recently as November, 1918. We do not recommend any increase in the Hat rate of 5s.7 (ii.) The Pre- War Dependency Pension. Here again some witnesses were in favour of its Memo, of total abolition, mainly on the ground that pre-war dependency is no evidence of present need, ^?lfa.st anfl which should be the real test; and that the pre-war dependence test puts the parent who made l!w.P.81 &quot; great financial sacrifice in order to give his son a better start in life, e.g., at a good school or Committee, technical college, to a great financial disadvantage as compared with a parent who enjoyed pre-enlistment support from his son.8 (iii.) The Parents&apos; Special Pension. This is criticised on the ground that it is in the nature Memo, of of relief, but the dependence of a parent on his son is on quite a different footing from that of, ^^yj?n e.g., a wife on her husband.  Moreover, as a rule, dependence for life of a parent on his son only Committees, exists when pecuniary need arises, and an introduction of this condition into the award of pension seems to be just.On the other hand, the requirement of the additional test of age or infirmity in all cases is felt by many to be unfair.&quot; The object should be to maintain as far as possible the same standard of comfort as the parents might reasonably have hoped to enjoy had the son been alive.&quot; (Memorandum of Association of L.W.P. Committees.)9. It must be borne in mind that both in the case of pre-war dependency, and also in the case of Parents&apos; Special Pensions, many, if not the majority, were originally fixed early in the war when prices were over than at present. -[There are two aspects of need, speaking broadly: (a) The claim of the parent as shown by actual incapacity for self-support, infirmity, &amp;c, and in a larger sense by normal expectation (if only usually for a somewhat short period and till the son would, in the ordinary course, marry) of a reasonable support.\b) The cases where the son has shown willingness to accept and meet this parenfs need by payment before he joined up as in the pre-war Dependency class.  . These two classes of cases are not mutually exclusive and many cases of (b) where a son has been able, through no fault of his own, to make only a small pre-enlistment payment will require reconsideration in coming years on the ground of (a), i.e., parents&apos; need, broadly considered.10. We recommend that:-(i.) For both-(a) Pre-war Dependency and(b) Parents&apos; Special (need) Pension,the maximum limit should be raised in all cases from 15s. to 20s., and lower amounts should be raised 33 per cent, in proportion. In the case of two Parents, provided need is proved, the limit should be raised to 40s.(ii.) That specially hard cases, e.g., where parents in poor circumstances have denied themselves to send a son to College in the expectation that he will become e.g., a teacher or a professional man, and support them decently in later life should be met by liberal arrangements under the Regulations of the Special Grants Committee.(iii.) That the grants to children of dependent widows should be continued and at the increased rates already approved by the Government for children.(iv.) In the case of a widow who has lost one or more sons in the Avar and Avho was solely dependent on him or them for support, we think that her case should be specially considered and regulations made by the Special Grants Committee who should provide an. extra allowance in addition to the fiat rate of 20s. as noAV amended.   &apos;(v.) In vieAv of the hardships Avhich, according to evidence before us, arise from insisting in all cases on the additional tests of old age and infirmity, that the regulations of the Special Grants Committee should provide for the payment of the Parents&apos; Special Pension (or an equivalent grant) up to 20s. in cases where special circumstances of need alone liberally interpreted are proved. When the regional areas are fully constituted, the poAver to make such payments should be transferred to the regional authorities.
Evidence was put before us that as the result of the triple system of pensions set out above there are inequalities as between one parent and another which cause irritation and ha rdship. -&quot;We recommend that the whole system should be reconsidered as early as possible with a view to revision and the assimilation of all three classes of cases on the basis of need broadly interpreted (i.e., reasonable expectation of what the son would have contributed had he lived), but generally subject to the maximum of 20/-, or higher in special cases, such as the case of the widowed mother mentioned in sub-sect, (iv.) of this paragraph. The revision could probably only be carried out either through the Local War Pension Committees, or by means of Iribunals sitting in each regional area, so that local evidence could be heard and local circumstances fully considered.  It should be open either to the Ministry or to the pensioner to apply for revision.We are aware of the administrative difficulties in the way of such a revision, but we believe that it is only by some such plan that the present inequalities can be remedied.11. (B.) Other Dependants. These are cases of actual dependency under Art. 22 (i.) of the Hodge Warrant, April, 1918.The conditions are the soldier must have died as under the conditions for. widows&apos; pensions (Art. 11) i.e., as a result of wounds during the war, or within seven years, or of disease contracted or commencing on active service or aggravated thereby within seven years of removal from duty. The dependant must not be a case specifically dealt with in previous articles of the Warrant, ie., not&apos; a motherless child (Art. 18) nor separated wife (Art. 19) nor unmarried wife (Art. 21) nor parent (Art. 22).In addition: (i.) Separation Allowance must have been paid or payable, and(ii.) The Dependant must be wholly or partly incapable of self support and be in pecuniary need.The maximum was 13/9.  We recommend it be raised by 33 per cent, to 18/4. Generally we, recommend that the Sliding Scale principle as recommended in our First Special Report should apply to the above increases, subject to the present rates under the Hodge Warrant being the minimum.The Government Actuary laid a Memorandum before us in which he estimated that for the cases now in receipt of pension the increases proposed would involve additional annual expenditure of close on  800,000; and allowing for increase in the number of claims due to improvement in the scale, that a further  400,000 will be required annually, or about  1,200,000 in all.PART II.-Officers&apos; Pensions.12. The Committee have received valuable assistance from the Officers&apos; Branch of the Pensions Ministry; from the Officers&apos; Friends&apos; Branch of the Ministry; also from representatives of the Admiralty, -of the Special Grants Committee, of the Parliamentary Army Committee, and the Parliamentary War Pensions Bureau.13. For officers in the Army, the principal authority as regards disability and death arising out of the Great War is the Royal Warrant of the 1st August, 1917 (Army Order 268/1917)^ This deals Avith disabled officers of the Army, with the families of deceased officers, and&apos; with disabled Army nurses. For officers of the Navy and their families, and Navy nurses, there is an Order in Council (1022) of the 29th September, 1917, corresponding with A.O. 268; and another Order in Council (1023) of the same date deals with Naval Warrant Officers and their families.The above regulations followed in their scope the men&apos;s Warrant and Order in Council of March, 1917. In April, 1918, an amending Warrant for soldiers, and in January, 1919, a similar Order in Council tor seamen, were published; but there has been no general revision of the Officers&apos;. Warrant and Order of 1917. Amendments and additions have, however, been approved from time to time, notably the addition of 20 per cent, to flat rates as from January 1st, 1919.The Royal Air Force came into existence on the 1st April, 1918. For various reasons no Order has yet been issued to govern disability grants and allowances for that force, but with Treasury sanction the Army Warrant of the 1st August, 1917, with necessary adaptations, is being applied.In September, 1919 (Army Order. 324), a new Royal Warrant introduced improved rates of pay, half pay, and service retired, pay for officers. The new rates of retired pay have an important bearing (as shown below) on the amounts which regular officers disabled in the Great War can receive.In the case of the Navy the new Admiralty Order (see Admiralty Weekly Orders, 19th July 1919), makes provisions similar to those of the new Warrant of 1919 for Army officers. For the Air Force similar new rates are contained in Air Ministry Weekly Orders, of the 15th September, 1919.The Committee have considered with care the Warrants and Orders in Council above mentioned, various memoranda prepared and laid before them by the Officers&apos; Branch and the Officers&apos; Friends&apos; Branch of the Ministry, and also the Report of a Departmental Committee, which was set up early in 1919 by the Minister of Pensions expressly to consider the Officers&apos; Warrant and the Regulations of the Special Grants Committee. The Departmental Committee, of which Major Hamilton, M.P., was the Chairman, made a full and careful report, and many of its recommendations have already been accepted by the Government and are now in operation.
Others of the Committees recommendations we have had to consider &quot;with care, together with modifications now rendered necessary owing to the new Warrant of September, 1919.Provision is also made for officers and their families, and for nurses, under the Regulations of the Special Grants Committee.14. In the first Report of the Select Committee (28th July, 1919) we recommended that soldiers&apos; pensions should, as in the case of. the Navy, be expressed to be by way of statutory right and not by way of bounty, and that the authority for their payment should be Act of Parliament and not Royal Warrant. This recommendation was accepted by the Government, and is now embodied in Section 7 of the War Pensions (Administrative Provisions) Act of 1919, but only in the case of&quot; officers and men,&quot; not in the case of their widows and dependants. We had evidence put before us that this exclusion of widows and dependants from the statutory recognition was felt as a hardship. We can see no reason for this distinction, and we recommend that Section 7 mentioned above should be amended so as to include widows and dependants. Evidence has been given us that some of the administrative improvements recommended by us in the First Report in the case of the men have not, so far, been applied to officers, e.g., they are not told at once when boarded what is their percentage of disability, nor have they at present any adequate opportunity of appealing on amount.We recommend that all the central or regional administrative improvements recommended in our First Report and accepted by the Government for men should, so far as applicable, be forth-with put in force for officers.15. The principal subjects to which we have had to direct our enquiry were: A. Temporary Officers&apos; Disability Scales generally (Art. 1 (1) of the 1917 Warrant).B. Permanent Officers&apos; Scales (Art. 1 (2) of the 1917 Warrant).C. Scales of Temporary Officers promoted from the ranks and already in receipt of a service Pension as a soldier (Art. 1 (3) of the 1917 Warrant).      ;D. Wound Gratuities and Pensions (Art. 1 (4) of the 1917 Warrant).E. Officers&apos; Children&apos;s Allowances (Art. 2 of the 1917 Warrant), together with an allowance for the wife.F. Officers&apos; Alternative Pension (Art. 3 of the 1917 Warrant).G. Grants to Officers&apos; Widows, including alternative pension; and grants to Dependants(Arts. 10-22 of the 1917 Warrant).H. Naval Officers&apos; and Warrant Officers&apos; Pensions; and Mercantile Marine Officers.I. Nurses.J. Other questions.We have tried to indicate in most places the probable cost of our proposals in the first year, but the figures must be regarded as general approximations only, as it has not been possible to obtain full actuarial estimates.A-Temporary Officers&apos; Disability Scales (Art. 1.(1) of the 1917 Warrant).16. It is necessary to consider first the relation between officers&apos; rates and men&apos;s rates, the latter having already been practically settled in accordance with the recommendations of the first report of the Select Committee.  (July 28,1919.)Our enquiries have shown us that an exact comparison is not feasible. Certain advantages have been granted to men which officers have not received, but, on the other hand, officers have special rights under former or the present Warrants (e.g., wound gratuities and pensions) which are not given to men; while officers&apos; gratuities on Demobilisation are on a far more liberal scale. On the other hand an officer is not, generally speaking, eligible for out-of-work donation. Again, in the case of relatives, existing provisions render any attempt at comparison very difficult. . In pre-war times and in the earlier days of this war, the distinction between officer and man was very wide. But the necessity of lifting the lower ranks to a more reasonable level, and the fact that in this war officers were drawn from all classes of the community have necessarily brought the relative rates of compensation nearer together.In this connection the comparative rates in other Armies and the Dominion Forces are of interest.Evidence Avas put before us that the percentage of Officers&apos; pensions to those of the men varied very widely in different countries, the difference ranging from 110 to 300 per cent. The comparison must not be pressed too far, as other elements (e.g., the alternative pension scales^ both for officers and men which exist in this country alone) enter in and render the flat rate scales by themselves an incomplete guide; but the comparison suggests that if the Subaltern&apos;s rate be fixed, as it now is in this country, at 200 per cent, (or double) th&amp;t of the Private, it is not unreasonable. Opinion was expressed by one or two witnesses that a large addition up to 40 or 50 per cent. should be made generally to Officers&apos; pensions; on the other hand, representations were put in evidence from various quarters that the comparative scales now existing showed too great a difference.The new privates maximum disability rate is made up as follows: Rate under Barnes Warrant c     27s. 6d.Further 20 per cent, (to remain permanent)       .     .     .     ^     33s.

As shown below, we think that the rates of alternative pension for officers and the scales for officers&apos; widows and children should be substantially improved; and also that a new special wife&apos;s allowance should be provided for officers&apos; wives, as it has been provided in accordance with the Select Committee&apos;s first report for the men&apos;s wives.Subject to these improvements being carried out, we have come to the conclusion that the existing flat rate for unmarried officers is not an unreasonable one, and we recommend no alteration^With regard to the 20 per cent. Bonus, as at present paid, this should be treated as definitely added to the officers&apos;pensions, but should be liable to variation upwards or downwards with the rise or fall of prices in accordance with the principle already recommended by the Select Com-mittee and adopted by the Government; but the existing flat rate without Bonus of  175, &amp;c, should be the fixed minimum in any case.The number of disabled temporary officers in receipt of pension, we are informed, is approxi-mately 30,000, and the annual charge is now approximately  2,000,000.B.-Disability Scales for Regular Officers (Article 1 (2) of the Warrant of 1917 andOrder in Council of 29th of September, 1917).18. Starting from the above conclusions as to the scales of Temporary Officers (Art. 1 (1) of the 1917 Warrant) the next step is to consider the assessment of disability retired .pay of Regular Officers (Art. 1 (2)).The problem here is to secure that adequate allowance is made for length of service and to give the Regular Officer, In view of that service, due consideration in comparison with the Temporary Officer.19. The Present Scheme. Broadly speaking, there are two methods by which a scale can be constructed where allowance is to be given both for service and rank, and for disability(i.) A service-and-rank scale, with additions for disablement; or(ii.) A disablement-and-rank scale, with additions for service.After various experiments in 1917 it was decided to adopt (i.), as (ii.) presented certain technical difficulties. The Army Pay Warrant of 1914 contained both a pure service scale (Article 558) and also a Disablement Scale varying with service (Article 564); and when the 1917 Warrant was being considered, it was decided to take the latter (Article 564) as the basis; and to this additions were made as set out in column 9 of the First Schedule of the Warrant, on a scale of  100 for 100 per cent, disablement, varying with the degree of disablement due to war service. For the Navy the service pension scale (commencing at age 40) was taken as a basis (see Orders in Council 22nd February, 1870, 8th December, 1903) the half-pay rates (some of which vary with seniority as well as rank) serving as the basis for officers under 40; to these the same disablement additio ns i.e., those in Column 9 of the Schedule were added.The Departmental Committee, after carefully examining the present composite rates in various typical instances, and comparing them with the ,rates for temporary officers, and testing them by other possible experimental schemes for Regulars, Avere of opinion that the existing scheme was an appropriate and equitable one. But in view of the new Retired Pay rates we think this matter must be reconsidered. . .20. New Scales of Service Retired Pay.-The War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry have recently issued new Orders improving the rates of service retired pay. (See for the Army, A.O. 324, September, 1919, and for the Navy, Admiralty Weekly Order, 19th July, 1919, and for Air Ministry, Air Weekly Order, 15th September. 1919.) It is therefore necessary to reconsider the provisions for disability in the light of &quot;these new regulations. Officers who have already served in the War and retired prior to September,!919, are given the benefit of the new rates. (See Table XVI. 5 of A.0.324of 1919.). It is important to observe that the new service rates professedly allow for the increased cost of living, and are to be subject to revision after five years to an extent not exceeding 20 per cent., and thereafter at intervals of three years. (See General Condition I. of Army.Order 324 of 1919.)* We note that the Departmental Committee came to a similar conclusion in March, 1919.. The comparison may be more clearly seen in this form: Former Rate.      Permanent .Total.Increase. Increase.Private      -     -     -   27/6 5/6 7/- ^      40/Annual equivalent     -    72  14  18 =      104
21. The natural basis to take for officers qualified for service retired pay is the new scales of such retired pay. But these scales only apply in the case of the Army to those with 15 years&apos; service, and in the case of the&apos;Navy and Air Force to those who are 40 years of age and over. For officers not so qualified we propose to take as a basis (i.) for the Army and Air Force  200 for a Lieut-Colonel,  170 for a Major, and for Captains and Subalterns a graduated Scale graded down from  140 for 14 years&apos; service, and with a minimum of  120 for a Captain and  70 for a Lieutenant and 2nd Lieutenant; and (ii.) for Lieutenants and Lieutenant-Commanders of the Navy the new invaliding scale varying with service in the rank laid down in the Admiralty Order above referred to. (See Par. 3 (a) of App. iii.) There is no provision in the Order quoted either for Sub-Lieutenants or for Commanders of the lioyal Navy. To meet the difficulty we recommend that  70 be the Scale for the Sub-Lieutenant, thus placing him on an equality with the Lieutenant of the Army, to whom he corresponds in rank, and for the Commander the new invaliding Scale applicable to Lieutenant-Commanders Avith increments of  10 for each year of service on the date of promotion to Lieutenant-Commander and a flat-rate addition of  50 for rank.As to the addition to be made for disablement, the present addition is that shown in column 9 of the First Schedule of the 1917 Warrant, viz:,  100 for 100 per cent, disablement, but to this at present must be added the 20 per cent, war bonus reckoned on the temporary officers&apos; scales, Avhich amount to  35 for 100 per cent, disablement in the case of a Captain or Subaltern,  45 in the case of a Major and  50 in the case of a Lieutenant-Colonel. So far as the retired pay element is concerned bonus may now be regarded as included in the neAV basic scales under the A.O. 324 of September, 1919. But so far as the disablement element is concerned it is necessary to augment this, and we recommend an increase of the present scale in column 9 of the.First Schedule by 50 per cent., making it  150 for 100 per cent, disablement, and that a proportionate addition be made for the over grades.22. We have especially considered Ayhether the neAV rates of half-pay laid doAvn in the recent Orders of the Service Departments should be regarded as minimum rates for disability. This is the general rule laid down in Article 564 of the Pay Warrant of 1914, but Ave understand that according to the ordinary rules of legal construction this gives no reserved right to anything more than the rates of half-pay prescribed in that Warrant of 1914. The -nevv rates of half-pay as laid down in A.O. 324 of 1919 show a very great increase, and we recommend that for regular officers of the Army these rates, Avithout any additions, should be accepted as minimum rates for disability. They will be liable to adjustment after five years, and should be limited to the substantive rank held by the officer at the time of his retirement.23. The effect of the foregoing proposals is shown in typical cases in Tables A and B below.The condition, applicable to men&apos;s disability pensions, that rovieAv and adjustment should take place periodically according to the cost of living, will be effective under our scheme for officers. It is prescribed in Condition 1 of the A.O. 324 of 1919 as regards the Army service and half-pay and retired pay scales, and a similar provision exists in the new regulations for the Navy and the Air Force; and Ave propose that it should similarly apply to our scale for Army officers under 15 years&apos; service, and to the Disablement (column 9) addition of 50 per cent, to the extent of  20.  - &apos;Army and Air Force Officers with betAveen 10 and 15 years&apos; service are.eligible under the recent Orders for gratuities for service. We recommend that they should have the option, if invalided, of receiving either the retired pay, according to length of service, proposed in the three preceding paragraphs in lieu of the gratuity, or of taking the gratuity and receiving in addition retired pay for disablement at a rate on the scale of  150 for 100 per cent, disablement, Avhichever is more advantageous.Similarly, officers promoted from the ranks to permanent commissions Avho are entitled to retired pay or gratuity under par. 572a of the 1914 Warrant as amended by A.O. 324 of 1919 should have a similar option.We are informed that the number of those Avho have.come Avithin Art. 1 (2) are as follows: Army -     -     -.....-     -  613Navy -     -     -&quot;    -     -     --    -     - -  367Total -  980The annual charge for retired pay in respect of the above is iioav approximately  221,000, of which about  48,000 is in respect of the Disablement addition.Table A-ARMY.24.Rank.2nd Lieutenant Lieutenant -CaptainMajor-________.............. a.................&quot;....Lt.-Colonel -I.-100 Per Cent.

A considerable number of ex-soldiers were given temporary commissions in the New Armies for the War, and many of these were men in receipt of Service Pensions, or who had qualified for such pensions when discharged to take commissions.* Includes service as Lieutenant-Commander.t Half Pay Rates.
These cases are dealt with by Article 1 (3) of the 1917 Warrant, which allows an addition for disablement as in Column 9 of the First Schedule to the Service Pension, with the temporary officers rate as a minimum.Complaints have been made that the officer promoted from the ranks of the Regular Army does not, under Article 1(3), enjoy his Service Pension to the full, in addition to Disability Pension, and that the scheme differs from the corresponding regulation for non-commissioned officers.Further, it is urged that the officers right to his Service Pension should remain unaffected; and in fact it does so, for that pension is not forfeited in any way. But rank is an element both in Service Pension and in Disability Pension, and rank should not count twice i.e., a man should not draw one pension partly based on his having been a Company Sergeant-Major and another partly based on his being a Lieutenant, any more than a disabled Major-General should draw retired pay as such and also the retired pay to which he would have been, entitled by service had he retired       Colonel before the war.26. In&apos;view of the new service rates and disablement additions for men, we have found it necessary to devote considerable time to this question. The increase of Service Pensions will undoubtedly much improve the position of those affected by Article 1 (3) of the Warrant, but it would be reasonable, in view of all the circumstances, we think, to give them the same scale of additions as is proposed above for Regular Officers under Article 1 (2) of the Warrant, viz.,  150 for 100 per cent, disablement.The effect of this has been worked out for the Chelsea Pensioners in 23 cases taken at random, and is shown in Table C below. It will be seen that there is a gain in every case, and generally a very substantial one. The average increase may be put at about  40 a year, of which  30 would represent increase of service rate and  10 increase of disablement additions. The total extra cost would be about  12,000 a year. Both the retired pay and the service pension contain a maintenance element. It is not desirable to make two maintenance allowances in full, and we, therefore, do not recommend the full Temporary Officers&apos; Disablement rate ( 210, &amp;c.) in addition to the retired pay on service pension respectively, but in both cases we recommend that the new and more generous disablement rates ( 150, &amp;c.) should be granted in addition to retired and service pay.27.

There are further difficulties to be considered besides those we have already dealt with. We have found it necessary to analyse the different classes of cases to be considered.Officers tx Receipt of Pensions as Soldiers.(a) Non-continuous Service. As stated above a considerable number of ex-soldiers, many of whom were in receipt of service pensions as soldiers, were given temporary commissions in the New Armies for the war. These cases are dealt with by Article 1 (3) of the Warrant, which allows an addition for disablement as in column 9 of the First Schedule to the service pensions, with the temporary officers&apos; rate as a minimum.
(b) Continuous Service. Similarly, serving N.C.O.&apos;s and men of the Regular Army were promoted to temporary commissions, Some of these had rendered sufficient service to qualify for pension when discharged to take up commissions, and the pensions that had been earned in such cases were duly awarded and issued concurrently with pay as an officer. These cases also are provided for by Article 1 (3) of the Warrant in the same way as the non-continuous service cases referred to in the previous paragraph.Officers not in Receipt of Pension as Soldiers.29. (c) Continuous Service. Other serving N.C.O.&apos;s and men had not qualified for service pensions as soldiers when discharged to take up commissions, but their later service, if it had been given as an N CO. or man instead of as an officer, might in some cases make their total service sufficient to qualify for a permanent pension under Article 1,141 of the 1914 Pay Warrant, if finally discharged as medically unfit.(d) Non-Continuous Service. There are also cases of N.C.O.&apos;s and men who had been discharged without pension, and were subsequently given temporary commissions in the New Army. These, men, if they had re-enlisted as N.C.O.&apos;s or men would, subject to the conditions laid down in Articles 1,135 and 1,136 of the 1914 Pay Warrant, have been entitled to reckon their former service as &quot; service&quot; or &quot; qualifying service,&quot; and if they had been subsequently invalided with not less than 14 years&apos; total service would have qualified for a permanent pension under Article 1,141 of the 1914 Pay Warrant. Their acceptance of temporary commissions, however, deprives them of this benefit of reckoning their former service for pension purposes and might result in their being less generously treated eventually, through their later service being given in a commissioned rank, than if they had re-enlisted as soldiers.30. The new rates of service pension authorised by A.O. 325 of 1919 will be granted to the men referred to in (a) and (b) ; but the men referred to in (c) and (d) are not eligible for these rates, nor even if their later service had been given as soldiers and not as officers would they have been eligible for them unless their total service amounted to 21 years. A total service of less than that amount but not less than 14 years would only entitle them to pension under the 1914 Pay Warrant. *As regards (a), we recommend that, for disablement pensions, they shall be dealt with as officers on the basis of  150 for 100 per cent, disablement, added to their revised service rates.With regard to the three other classes ot cases we recommend that a proviso should be introduced to ensure that such officers should not at any time receive less than the permanent pensions they would have received if disabled as soldiers in the rank they held at the time of promotion to a Commission.D.-Wound Gratuities and Wound Pensions (Article 1 (4) of the1917 Warrant).31. It was given in evidence that the scheme of wound gratuities and pensions laid down for Army officers in Articles 639 to 653 of the 1914 Pay Warrant, and in corresponding Regulations for the Navy, has during the war proved arbitrary and inequitable as a form of award, has prevented the evolution of a satisfactory plan of compensation for disablement, and has been a cause of constant difficulties in administration.Apparently the wound pension goes back to very early times. It bears all the traces of an early origin the importance attached to wounds in comparison with disease, the attention given to the disfigurement and disablement caused by the loss of a limb or eye (no longer so serious now with better surgical skill and appliances), the weight given to seniority in rank, and the marked distinction between the officer and the soldier. It also shows evidence of patch-work construction in the variation of the conditions, e.g., between the conditions for wound pension and those for injury pensions. Evidence before us showed that in actual practice the award or otherwise of a wound pension depended often on accidental factors.The Departmental Committee advised that the whole question of the existing system of officers&apos; wound gratuities and pensions, when such officers are retired, should be considered by the Pensions Minister in consultation with the Service Departments.We understand that the Pensions Minister is in consultation with the Departments on the subject. It is now impossible to make any radical change for officers disabled iri the recent war, but we recommend that the whole policy of wound pensions and gratuities should be reconsidered by the Departments together with the Pension Ministry, and a logical conclusion arrived at for the future.On the whole, officers who receive wound gratuities or pensions benefit considerably in comparison with officers disabled by disease. The distinction is especially marked where the officer receives, in addition to his wound pension, retired pay under the 1914 Pay Warrant, Wo do not propose that any change generally should be made in Article 1 (4), but we recommend that the bonus should be added as for disablement by sickness.   &apos;
W 11With, regard to the numbers of those in receipt of wound gratuities and wound pensions we were informed the numbers are as follows: Total gratuities granted -------   20,250refused  -......  22,220Total Pensions current......-    6,270E.-Allowances for Children of Disabled Officers (Article 2 of the 1917 Warrant); together with Special Allowance for the Wife.32, Under Article 2 the question of the children&apos;s allowances raises that of an allowance for the wife. As in the case of the men there was no allowance for the officers wife under the 1917 Warrant. A wife&apos;s allowance was recommended in our First Report for the men and was accepted by the Government, the rate being 10s. a week for a man 100 per cent, disabled or  26 a year, diminishing pro rata with the husband&apos;s disability as in the case of the children&apos;s allowances.For the same reasons as were urged in the case of the men, a similar wife&apos;s allowance is desirable for officers&apos; wives-the maximum to be  50 per annum. The wifes allowance for the men was fixed at 10s., or one quarter of the single man&apos;s maximum rate, which was fixed at 40s. This proposal for officers&apos; wives&apos; maximum allowance keeps practically the same proportion.The number of pensionable wives is estimated in round figures to be 10,000, and assuming the average amount of payment works out, taking the higher with the lower grades of disability, at 50 per cent., the change will involve a cost of approximately  250,000.Differences of view were expressed as to whether this new wife&apos;s allowance should be a flat rate payment made to every wife whether in need of it or not. On the one hand, the wife&apos;s allowance in the case of the men is made without any enquiry as to need, and such enquiries are apt to be resented as inquisitorial; on the other hand, it is clearly undesirable to pay allowances to those who do not need them; and it was suggested that a simple declaration by the husband that he was in need of assistance might be sufficient, without further proof.The Chairman of the Special Grants Committee pointed out in his evidence that it might be more advantageous to the wives of officers in the lower grades of disability if the wife&apos;s sir Matthew allowance were not a flat rate diminishing with her husband&apos;s disability but Avere payable under Nathan, Regulation of the Special Grants Committee up to the full amount needed were proved    li27L whatever the degree of the husband&apos;s disability.We recommend:-(i.) That the new  50 allowance be paid as a flat rate allowance (diminishing pro rata with the officers disability), but only on application by the officer or his wife.(ii.) That in the case of the lower grades of disability the Special Grants Committee have power, when need is shown, to increase the allowance up to  50.Ci-iildren&apos;s Allowances (Article 2 of the 1917 Warrant).33. Under this Article education allowances not exceeding  50 a year may be made for each child, provided pecuniary need be proved.It is convenient to mention here the other allowances made for children of officers: (a) Under Regulation 1 of the Special Grants Committee a maintenance allowance up to  24 a year is payable in supplement of retired pay, while under Regulation 3 an allowance up to  20 is paid, where no retired pay is given.(b) Under Regulation 9 of the Special Grants Committee an education allowance is payable up to limits varying with the age of the child and type of school, but in any case not exceeding  50.The Special Grants Committee must in the case of all the grants they make be satisfied as to the special circumstances of the case.As to these rates for officers&apos; children generally, it will be noticed that they do not, as in the case of children&apos;s allowances for men, diminish with the number of children.For instance, in the case of the grant under Regulation 1 of the Special Grants Committee which is usually given at the maximum of  24, the comparison works out thus: Officers Man&apos;s    s. d.     s. d.First child - - 24 0 0 - - - 26 0 0 Second child - - 24 0 0 - - - - 19 10 0 Third child   -     -   24  0  0     -     -     -     15 12  0The ground for this difference is that proof of circumstances is required in the case of officers&apos; children but not for those of privates.34. Generally with regard to children&apos;s allowances, we recommend as follows: (i.) That the limit of  50 under Article 2 of the Warrant be increased from  50 to  80.(ii.) That the  24 limit under Regulation 1 of the Special Grant&apos;s Committee be raised to  30 and a Bonus of 20 per cent., variable with the cost of living, be added, bringing the limit up to  36.(iii.) That in the case of the death of the wife the first child should step up into the mother&apos;s place and receive the wife&apos;s allowance if more advantageous.(iv.) That the maximum under Regulation 9 be raised from  50 to  80,
v. It is estimated that there are about 15,000 children of disabled officers, but of these only some 2,000 are receiving assistance. We were unable to arrive at any figure of probable cost involved in our recommendations.F. Alternative Retired Pay for Officers (Article 3 of the 1917 Warrant),WoPBB. We have considered the question of the officers&apos; alternative pension carefully and with special reference to the conclusions recommended in the Select Committee&apos;s first Report for men and accepted by the Government. We understand, further, that the principles so adopted for the men&apos;s alternative pension have already, in fact, with the approval of the Government, been to a large extent made applicable to Officers&apos; Pensions.For the sake, however, of precision, and to prevent misunderstanding: (i.) We recommend that, as in the case of the men, officers&apos; pre-war earnings be &quot; loaded up &quot; by 60 per cent, on the lines set out in the Committee&apos;s first Report.(ii.) In the case of the men, the former rule was that a man could receive up to 50s. of pre-war earnings in full, but from 50s. to 100s. only one-half i.e., the limit was 75s. Similarly, with the officers&apos; alternative pension, the officer can receive up to  300 of pre-war earnings in full, but from  300 to  600 only one-half, i.e., the limit&apos; is  450. In the case of the men we recommended, and the Government accepted, the abolition of the 50 per cent, arrangement, and a man can now receive up to the full 100s, a week of pre-war earnings or  260 per annum. We recommend also that in the case of officers the 50 per cent, arrangement be abolished, but that the limit be placed at  500. This proposal is generally in accordance with the principle suggested above, that a fair scale for officers should be double that tor the men.(iii.) A. hardship arises in the case of officers retired and in receipt of retired pay before the war who are not allowed to count this as &quot; pre-war earnings&quot; for the purpose of alternative Pension (See Definition Article 30 (5)). We recommend accordingly that for the purpose of assessing alternative pension in the case of an officer in receipt of retired pay before re-joining the officer should be allowed to count such retired pay as pre-war earnings. The amount so arrived at should then be loaded up by 60 per cent. He should not be entitled to receive retired pay in addition to alternative pension so arrived at. Should any cases arise where a similar calculation would be necessary in connection with men&apos;s alternative pension, we recommend a similar rule should be applied.The number of officers now in receipt of alternative pension is approximately 300, and the amount so expended is about  75,000 annually.G-.-Pensions and Grants to Officers&apos; Relatives (Articles 10-22 of the 1917 Warrant).36. There is considerable variety in the provisions for the families of officers and men respectively. This was unavoidable because under the regulations existing before the war officers&apos; families were fairly liberally dealt with, whereas men&apos;s families were almost unprovided for; consequently improvements for officers&apos; families have had to be grafted on to existing reserved rights, while for men&apos;s dependants entirely new regulations have been devised, more suited to their actual circumstances and needs. Even had new provisions on the same lines been framed for officers&apos; relatives, old rights would have had to be reserved, and much confusion would have resulted in the consideration of options and concurrent regulations. The two systems have had a distinct history, and in contrasting advantages it must be remembered that exact comparison in detail is not possible.Pensions to Officers&apos; Widows (Article 11 of the 1917 Warrant).37. The existing scheme of officers&apos; widows&apos; pensions has a long history behind it. From about the time of the Peninsular War there were two scales of widows&apos; pensions, the highest for death.&apos;sin action and the ordinary for long service, the latter being just half of the former. During the Crimean War the intermediate rate was introduced, which was exactly intermediate between the other rates; it was given for deaths due to fatigue, privation, or exposure incident to the active operations in the Crimea.  Later, it was extended to deaths by injury in the performance of duty.The changes in the present war have been mostly in the direction of extension and relaxation of conditions and grants of a supplementary kind, rather than by way of an increase in rates.The only change in rates has been to level up the subaltern&apos;s widow to the captain&apos;s widow&apos;s scale, and the children of subalterns, captains and majors to the scale for a lieutenant-coloners children; and the addition of a bonus.38. The following table shows the present position of a widow of a temporary second lieutenant compared with that before the war: Previous. Present (with bonus).1. Officers death in action      -     -&quot;    -   80 pension      -     -    120 pension. 100 gratuity    -     -   100 gratuity.2.

Widow. Wt. 0.&apos;s Widow. Privates Widow.Highest.     Intermediate.

That in the case of all Avidows with children, and of AvidoAvs of 40 and over, Avhether with or Avithout children, the pension should be the full two-thirds of the flat rate for the officer.(ii.) That Avidows under 40 and without children should remain on their present intermediate or highest scale (with bonus) respectively; and in case of need provision should be made for them by regulations of the Special Grants Committee.The AAridoAv of the officer killed in battle will still receive special battle gratuity.    .We think it is desirable that the Avhole question of abolishing entirely in future the intermediate rate and placing the classes that iioav come under that head for alt purposes on the highest rate should be considered. .Children of a Deceased Officer, their Mother (the Officer&apos;s . Widow) Being Still Alive (Art. 12 of the 1917 Warrant).39. For children in this case provision is made,a. In the 1917 Warrant by Article 12, In this Article AvidoAvs entitled under Article 11 to the highest and intermediate rates can receive  24 and  20 respectively (increased by Bonus to  28 16s: and  24 for each child) as laid doAvn in Schedule II., columns 5 and 6. In addition, the Avidow may receive an education allowance not exceeding  35 (Article 12 (4)).As already indicated, Ave have recommended that the division betAveen the intermediate and the highest scale for AvidoAvs should be for certain purposes modified ; and we recommend(a) With regard to the children&apos;s alloAvances under this head that the difference be abolished, that they all be placed on the highest scale, and that the rate for that scale be increased from  28 16s. to  36.(b) That the limit under Article 12 (4) be raised from  35 to  80, and that grants under 12 (4) should be payable even in cases Avhere a widoAv receives an alternative pension, provided need is shown to exist.(c) That the age limit for children under Article 12 be reduced from 9 years to 8.t* We understand that the raising of this rate to  50 is already in process of being carried out. t We understand that this is in course of being carried out. 0.187. c 2
b. The Special Grants Committee have power to supplement the allowance for a widow and children up to a maximum, including State Pension under Article 12 (but exclusive of education allowance, either under Warrant or Regulation) of  150. 20 per cent, of the improved rates should be treated as variable in the usual way. We recommend that this be extended so that  150 be tjie limit for the widow alone, with a similar limit of  36 for each child.&apos; We understand that the extension of education allowance (under para. 9) to delicate children not attending school has already been carried through; if not, we recommend that it should be done.Widows&apos; Alternative Pensions (Article 13 of the 1917 Warrant).40.-We have considered the provisions of the officers&apos; widows&apos; alternative pensions with reference to the Commifctee&apos;s recommendations in the case of alternative pensions for men&apos;s widows. (Paragraphs 17a and 176.)In our view the same principles generally apply to the alternative pension of officers&apos; widows.We recommend:-(a) That the alternative pension for officers&apos; widows be based on pre-war earnings loaded up 60 per cent, as in the parallel case of men&apos;s Avidows.(b) That the AvidoAv Avith children Avho at first goes on the flat rate pension should have &apos; the option to come on the alternative pension if she desires it, as her children Avork off the Pension Scale.  But she should apply to do so Avithin a limited time so that the necessary evidence may at once be obtained and put on record.  Later on the evidence may not be available.(c) The AvidoAv should be allowed alternative pension on the basis of two-thirds of her husband&apos;s earnings Avhether in fact he Avould have been himself entitled to the alternative pension or not.Motherless Children (Article 17 of the 1917 Warrant).41. These are provided for in Article 17 of the Warrant, and by the Special Grants Committee Regulations.We recommend that the limit of  40 ( 48 Avith Bonus) in Article 17 be raised to  60 ( 72 with Bonus), of Avhich 20 per cent, should be treated as variable according to the ordinary rule ; and that in the case of motherless children not in receipt of State Pension the Special Grants Committee have poAver to make grants up to  40 a year.Relatives of Deceased Officers, Other Than Widoavs and Children (Articles 18-22of the 1917 Warrant).42. The provision for officers&apos; relatives in the Warrant of 1917 is a development and expansion of previous regulations. Hence they are framed somewhat differently from those for men&apos;s relatives Avhich Avere first created for the present Avar. For that reason any exact comparison betAveen them is impossible.The relatives Avho can be considered under the Warrant are parents, sisters. and brothers. Other dependants can be assisted by the Special Grants&apos; Committee.Parents of officers may have pensions if the officers death Avas attributable to service. Their means, including the pension, must not exceed a reasonable limit. The main basis of the pension &apos; is pre-Avar dependence, allowance being also made for infirmity, old age, etc. Pensions may also be given. Avhere there Avas no pre-War dependence, if the parents are old or infirm, or poor and received some help from the son during his service; Ave understand that where the parent, in face, received no help from the son during service, pension is only paid in very- exceptional circumstances. We recommend that in such cases subject to the continuance of the discretionary poAver noAv vested in the Minister, pensions should be allowed in all cases Avhere need broadly interpreted is proved. The pension may be small or large and may be as much as the AvidoAv&apos;s rate.We recommend that the limit in future should be as high as the neAV tAvo-thirds rate recommended above for AvidoAvs,.In non-attributable cases an officers parents may receive a gratuity not exceeding the value of one year&apos;s AvidoAv&apos;s pension; in this case also Ave recommend that the neAV AvidoAv&apos;s rate should be the limit.Officers&apos; sisters or brothers may receive pensions on conditions generally similar to parents. The sisters or brothers must be under 21 or 18 respectively, or unable to earn through infirmity or age.  The pension limit in this case also should be the neAV one proposed for AvidoAvs.Officers&apos; brothers or sisters may have gratuities not exceeding one half the value of one year&apos;s AvidoAv&apos;s pension if not qualified for pension e.g., if a sister is over 21 and able-bodied, or if death Avas non-attributable.   Here also the neAV rate should be taken.As to bonus, 20 per cent, is at present added to the pensions payable to parent, sisters and brothers: but the increases above recommended should be treated as including bonus Avith 20 per cent, variable in the usual Avay.With regard to the problem of two parents Avho have lost more than one son through the Avar. Ave recommend that  50 a year be added, to the means limit and the maximum pension, so as to alloAv something more for the tAvo parents and the double dependence.  A gratuity not exceeding
the value of one year&apos;s widow&apos;s pension as revised should also be provided where there is one parent who has lost two sons, whose joint contribution exceeded the limit of pension.Hard cases sometimes occur in which a mother and sister were both dependent on an officer and the mother is granted a pension but dies a few months later. As the mother has had a pension the sister cannot on her death claim one. It is true that the Special Grants Committee generally assist her, but we recommend that a sister, if otherwise eligible for a pension, should be allowed to claim a pension even though her mother or father may have been in receipt of one in respect of the same officer.H. Naval Officers and their Relatives.43. The case of Naval Officers and their relatives has for certain purposes been dealt with above. But the case of the Commissioned Warrant and Warrant Officer requires separate consideration.Seniority for Retired Pay.44. By Admiralty Weekly Order of 13th September, 1918, promotion of Warrant Officers to Commissioned Warrant Officer was accelerated from 15 years&apos; to 10 years&apos; service. Most of the Commissioned Warrant Officers have served 15 or more years for their step, and on promotion they were paid at the rate that would have been applicable had they been promoted on attaining 10 years&apos; seniority, i.e., an officer with 14 years&apos; seniority as Warrant Officer is considered for pay purposes as a Commissioned Warrant Officer of four years&apos; seniority.Under the revised rates of pay of 19th July, 1919, this rule was still observed as regards full pay, but not for retired pay. Thus in the case of two Warrant Officers, one with 15 years&apos; service, the other with 10 years, each arriving at their respective seniority on the day the new Regulations came into force tor full pay the 15 years&apos; officer counted five years&apos; seniority as Commissioned Warrant Officer, the other receiving the lowest rate of pay of his rank.Assuming they both retired together, their pensions would be assessed at equal rates, notwithstanding that the senior officer had served five years since promotion to Warrant rank.By Admiralty Order 2483a of 19th July, 1919, Article 5, certain other classes of officers had an acceleration of promotion, but in each case the dates of their commissions were ante-dated, thus leaving no doubt of their receiving the full benefit of their service on being retired.This appears a case of considerable hardship when it is borne in mind that the five years&apos; seniority in question was gained during the recent War, under conditions more strenuous and arduous than in any other period of the officers career.Many officers are affected by this decision, a proportion of whom are disabled and receiving consideration from the Ministry of Pensions.To rectify the foregoing it would appear only necessary to ante-date the seniority of all Chief Warrant Officers to the date when they completed 10 years&apos; service in the Warrant Rank, and that the change may be made in the Navy List.As a Committee we are only concerned with the case of disabled Officers, and we do not wish to go beyond this, or to prejudge any purely Service question, but we have consulted representatives from the Admiralty and we are informed that there appears to be no serious difficulty in the above proposal, and we recommend accordingly that it should be carried out.Disability- Pensions.45. Warrant Officers are of two grades Commissioned Warrant Officers and Warrant Officers (without Commissions).The first grade are mostly Regulars. The second are partly Regulars and partly temporary men, the latter preponderating.The scales for temporary Warrant Officers are: Commissioned Warrant,  150 for 100 per cent, disablement;Warrant,  125 for 100 per cent, disablement.To these scales a bonus of 20.per cent, is added, making the totals  180 and  150 respectively.These rates compare not unreasonably with the scale of  210 for a Sub-Lieutenant, iFor Regular Warrant Officers the present rule in Article (2) of the Order in Council (1023) of 29th September, 1917, is that the Warrant Officer receives in addition to his service pension a -disablement addition at the rate of  100 for 100 per cent, disablement, if commissioned, and  75 for 100 per cent, disablement, if not commissioned. To this a bonus is added at the rate appropriate for a temporary officer of the same rank.The Admiralty have now increased the service pensions of these classes very liberally, and the increased rates allow for the higher cost of living.The question is one which only concerns us so far as cases of Disability are involved; we are not in a position to appreciate fully the service considerations applicable, but on the basis of existing differences of scale generally, we would recommend that the maximum additions be increased for Commissioned Warrant Officers from  100 to  120, and for Warrant Officers from  75 to  90.
Hi oOn that basis the results in certain actual typical cases would be as follows :-I. Commissioned Warrant Officer.(1) . Old Service Rates.	(2) Disablement addition.	(3) Bonus.	(4) Present Total (IX (2), (3).	(5) New Service Rates.	(6) New Dis-ablement addition.	(7) New Total (5) &amp; (6).	(8) : Increase. 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 149	30	9	188	205	36	241	53108	50	15	173	215	60	275	-    102122	60	18	200	230	72	302	102			II. Warrant Officer.				40	30	10	80	135	36	171	9175	75	25	175	180	90    &apos;	270	9593	22	8	123	180	27	207	84Widows and Children.46. As regards widows of Naval Warrant Officers, the present rates represent one-half of the disablement rate.  Thus the widows get: Commissioned Warrant Officer   \ of  150 ^  75 plus  15 (bonus) =  90.Warrant Officer -     -     -     \ of  125 =  62 10s. Od. plus  12 10s. Od. (bonus) =  75.We recommend that where the widow is over 40 or has children the rates be increased to  85 plus  17 bonus =  102 and  75 plus  15 bonus =  90, respectively.Children&apos;s allowances for these grades must be raised in view of the increase allowed for seamen&apos;s children.The scales compare as follows:  -New scale forWarrant Officer (with bonus) Seamen (without bonus).   s. d.    s. d.1st Child - - - 18 0 0 - - 26 0 0 2nd Child - - - 15 0 0 - - 19 10 0 3rd Child - - - 12 0 0 - - 15 12 0 4th Child - - - 9 0 0 - - 15 12 0 We recommend the following scale for children of Warrant Officers, a variable bonus of 20 per cent, to be added:    1st Child 25 with bonus     -     -     302nd Child 20    ,, -     -     253rd Child - - - 15 ,, ,, - - 18 4th Child    -     -i    -     15 ,,        -\  -     18These rates will apply to the children of (1) disabled Commissioned Warrant and Warrant Officers, (2) Widows of such Officers.Mercantile Marine.47. The question of pensions for Officers of the Mercantile Marine, so far as they were engaged on War Service, is a difficult one, and one which requires consideration on generous lines. Many difficult questions arise, e.g., the difference between those who joined on Under T. 124 Z for general service, and for the duration of the war; and those who joined on under T. 124 for a limited service, eg., for service in one ship only, and who usually received a higher rate of pay. The former got Naval Rates of Pay and Pensions, while the latter only received Mercantile Rates of Pay, and are only entitled to very limited Pension arrangements under the War Risks (1914) Insurance Corporation; and it is urged there is great hardship in the latter case.There were other points put before us with regard to the Mercantile Marine, but we feel that the matter should be further considered after hearing evidence from representatives of the Board of Trade, the War Risks (1914) Insurance Corporation, and from the Mercantile Officers themselves and their official organisations, and we do not at this stage make any recommendation. We think evidence should be heard on these points, assuming that the Committee is reconstituted when Parliament meets after the prorogation.I.-Nurses.  (Articles 23 to 29 and Schedule III. of the 1917 Warrant.)48. The existing scales for Nurses are set out in Schedule III, and vary in the case of anurse 100 per cent, disabled as follows: (a) Principal Matron or Matron-in-chief -     -     -     -     -  175(6) Matron..........  125(c) Staff Nurse or Sister........  100
17For the lower grades of disability the amount falls proportionately under each head. The bonus of 20 per cent, is paid in each case.Evidence was put before us as to the great hardship experienced by nurses in general owing to the inadequacy of the rate of their pension, particularly when disabled to the extent of 100 per cent., and not in need of institutional or hospital treatment.We think the rate for Matron-in-Chief and Principal Matron should remain as at present -i.e.,  175 with bonus  210.We recommend that the other scales should be raised for maximum disability as follows: (6) Matron to.....-     -     -     -     -   150(c) Staff nurse or sister to....... 125the lower grades of disability to be raised in proportion; and Bonus to be added; and similar provisions should apply to corresponding ranks of naval nurses.c;MThe number of nurses now in receipt of pension is, we understand, approximately 1,000 at a cost of about  44,000. The increased annual expenditure involved in our proposal is estimated approximately at  15,000.49. The Special Grants Committee have recently acquired powers to assist disabled members of the Nursing Services. We recommend that their regulations should make provision so as to provide aid in cases where a nurse&apos;s relatives were dependent on her for support. .50. The Ministry have powers to deal under the terms of the Warrant (Article 23) with the disability claims of the recognised personnel of certain organised and approved associations or hospitals regularly engaged in military nursing in connection with the war. In vieAv of hard cases brought to our notice in connection with nurses bond fide disabled in War Service, but not being in the employment of one of the recognised associations, we recommend these powers should be extended to include all cases of nurses so disabled in the course of bona fide War Service.51. A further difficulty arises in the case of the General Service Section of the V.A.D.&apos;s, who, while not engaged on nursing duties, belonged to a recognised part of the military organisation for the war, and were disabled while so serving. Evidence before us is not sufficient to enable us to determine what scale of compensation is appropriate to their case, but we recommend that the matter should at once be considered by the War Office and Ministry of Pensions, and that proper provision be made either through the Warrant or the Regulations of the Special Grants Committee for pension for those so disabled as the result of War Service.J.-OTHER QUESTIONS.1. Limits of Bonus and Pension.52. In the Ncase of officers and their relatives the 20 per cent, bonus has been subject to certain total limits of pension and bonus. The limits appear to us in certain instances unduly low, and after due consideration we recommend :-(1) That no bonus be added, to alternative retired pay or alternative pension, provided the pre-Avar earnings are loaded up;(2) that the limit for officers in other circumstances, including Naval Commissioned Warrant and Warrant Officers, be  300;(3) that the limits for relatives be removed.2. Regular Officers in India.53. Our attention has been called to the fact that Regular Officers of the British Service serving in India during the War are not considered as eligible for the benefits of the War Warrant, on the ground that troops in India were never declared to be on active service. Regular Officers in the United Kingdom and in other parts of the Empire, and Territorial Officers in India, are eligible for consideration under the War Warrant, and so are Regular soldiers serving in India. We recommend that this distinction should be abolished,3. Income-tax Exemption for Disability Pensions and Allowances.54. This difficulty has already been partially dealt Avith by legislation, but Avidows&apos; pensions are still liable to tax.We recommend that all Avives&apos;, AvidoAvs&apos;, children&apos;s and dependants&apos; fiat-rate pensions and alloAvances, being, in fact, payments on account of disability, should, so far as not at present exempt, be freed from tax, and that in the case of alternative pensions an analogous allowance be made,4, Children&apos;s Advancement Alloavances.55. In most professions and businesses initial payments or an allowance to cover at least the first year&apos;s maintenance are necessary.We recommend that a gratuity equal to one year&apos;s children&apos;s allowance (maintenance and education) should he payable in case of need to a child after he or she ceases to be eligible for the allowance in order to start him or her in a profession or business.5. Payment of Children&apos;s Alloavances. 56. Difficulties, we are informed, arise in many cases because these allowances are paid yearly only and not quarterly,We recommend that at the Ministers discretion such alloAvances should, Avhen found desirable, be paid quarterly.
6. Officers of Royal Navy and Royal Marines Called up from the Retired List 57. It lias been represented to us that a difficulty arises with regard to officers called up from the Retired List, and it has been proposed that such officers should, on reverting to the same, count their service and the rank to which they may have been promoted during the war for re-assess-ment of pension under the Admiralty scale of 1919; or, in the alternative, their pre-war retired pay should be paid concurrently with full pay for whole periods served daring the Avar in lieu of the 25 per cent, additional to full pay which noAv obtains.We telt that this matter Avas a complicated one, and one in Avhich we Avere only concerned so far as questions of disablement arise. But on the recommendations put before us Ave were of opinion that the matter should be fully reconsidered and a decision given and published by the Admiralty at an early date, and we recommend accordingly.7. Constant Attendant^ Allowance.  (Art. 6 (c) of the 1917 Warrant.)58. Evidence put before us with regard to the constant attendants allowance shoAved that the present amount payable is not adequate, and we recommend that the amount be raised from  78 to  100.PART III.-Treatment and Training.59. We have heard a considerable amount of evidence as regards the present arrangements for Treatment and Training, both of officers and men. Both are subjects presenting great difficulties, and if the Select Committee is reappointed Avhen Parliament meets,- Ave propose to call farther evidence.But Ave desire to draw attention without delay to the very serious state of affairs due to the Avant of proper accommodation for training, particularly of N.C.Os. and men. The representatives of the Labour Ministry in their evidence stated that there Avere some 13,000 men only actually in training, See that 20,000 more Avere on the waiting list, and that there Avere some 40,000 more ready to comeMr. Currie forward and train if vacancies for training were advertised. In other words that there Avas a clear low Qr&apos;i?294 ^e^cieney 0f training facilities for some 60.000.et se2- 60. It is admitted that the great difficulty is the provision of satisfactory large Avorkshops orpremises in Avhich to carry on training.The Ministry have schemes in hand which should provide shortly some 8,000 more places, O 10273      DUt this is but a small Avay towards the 30,000 places Avhich is the minimum the Ministryconsider necessary to meet the urgent need.61. The principal difficulty is that Avhile the need is very urgent, and the pressure of manu-facturers and private enterprises to acquire or erect factories and big premises is very great, the acquisition or erection of such buildings through the ordinary operations of Board of Works and Treasury methods is sIoav. When negotiations are commenced for the purchase of a suitable factory evidence showed that it Avas often snapped up by a private purchaser while the papers Avere still circulating through the Government Departments.We consider the matter so urgent, and the irritation being caused by the delay to provide proper training accommodation so serious, that we recommend as an urgency matter, and till, say. some 10,000 or 15,000 more places are provided, that the Labour Ministry be empoAvered to select proper buildings and that full authority be given to an expert in land acquisition, known to and trusted by the Government,, to negotiate and complete the transactions forthwith  provided he were satisfied that the building Avas satisfactory and the price not unreasonable, and certified accordingly.PART IV.-Disability and Deaths in Previous Wars.62. In 1918 the existing pensions were increased to the rates approved by the Warrants of that year for present Avar cases in the following classes :-(1) Seamen, marines, soldiers and airmen totally incapacitated by Avar disabilities from earning a livelihood.(2) Those partially disabled by specific wounds and injuries.(3) WidoAVS of men dying of wounds in action or on duty or of disease contracted on forme i&quot; war service.As announced on 3rd July, 1919, further extensions have been approved and the pensions in payment on 1st April, 1919, are being increased from the latter date to the rates payable for the present Avar in the following cases: (4) Officers, naval warrant officers, nurses, N.C.O.&apos;s and men disabled, Avhefher wholly or partially, by Avounds, injuries, or disease due directly and wholly to Avar service.(5) Such AvidoAvs and children of officers as have had their rates of pension increased for this year i.e., the&apos; pensions and compassionate alloAvances of WidoAvs of Subalterns and the compassionate allowances of children, of Majors and Captains.To the increased retired pay and pensions the 20 per cent, bonus is added, subject to the limits imposed for the present Avar.63. We recognise that it is not possible in some cases (e.g,, alternative pensions where no proof of or comparison with pre-war earnings Avould be possible) to give those disabled in previous wars, the same benefits as have been accorded in this Avar. But subject to such exceptions Ave think the right principle is that those disabled in previous wars and their dependants, both officers and men, should, if already in receipt of disablement pension or allowance, receive the benefit of all the improved rates granted to officers and men and their dependants in the present war; and we recommend accordingly.Printed tinder the authority of HIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office by Wyman &amp; Sons, Limited, Fetter Lane, London, E.C. 4.
