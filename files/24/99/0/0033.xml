Secondly, in event of complete collapse of Volunteer Army, it will be necessary to remove Array and compromised civilians both from Crimea and Novorossisk to a place of safety * &quot;It is considered most unlikely that the Bolsheviks will accept their surrender on terms a   It is therefore in this event a case of evacuation or extermination.Commander-&apos;in-Chief requests early decision on the following points(a) Will H. i&apos;;. Government authorise the evacuation of surplus Crimean population and supply of coal and 611 to the remainder ?(h) In the event of total collapse of Volunteer Army will H*m. Government authorise arrangements for evacuating Array and the non-Bolshevik compromised population in South Russia generally ?(c) In either case can the Government allocate some place of asylum for refugees until circumstances enable them to return to Russia ?A Conference was held at the Admiralty, representatives of War Office, Foreign Office., Colonial Office and Treasury being present, and the following answers to questions (a), (b) and (c) were recommended.(a) The answer to the first part of question is in the negative as far as a general eva.cua.tion is concerned. With regard to 2nd party coal and oil sufficient f^r flour mills, solely asa relief measure, should be supplied, the cost to be borne by the Allieso(b) No, this is not practicable.(c) The answer to this is No. The practical difficulties render help on any sufficient scale impossible. The Crimea should be regarded as the asylum for refugees and held by General Denikin.Commander-in-Chief reports than when Odessa fell on 7th February, it was possible to evacuate by sea ahout 9,000 soldiers, 11,300 refugees and 900 sick and wounded, partly to Crimea, mainly to Bulgaria, Serbia and Princess Islands.   This evacuation was carried out principally by the British.   It was conducted by H.M.S. &quot;AJAX&quot; assisted by &quot;CERES&quot;, &quot;SPORTIVE&quot; and 5 transports, one or two ships of other nationalities and some local craft.   General Schilling and about 7,000 troops got away in Russian ships to Sevastopol.The evacuation was extremely difficult owing to tho harbour being frozen and the panic that ensued-.   Nearly all the ships were fired on* but there were no British casualties. Machine guns appeared all over the town and the masses on the quay trying to escape were frequently under machine gun and rifle fire*Commander-in-Chief points out that the measures adopted &apos; were improvised at short notice and imperfect, and that similar temporary expedients would be wholly inadequate for evacuation of the numbers which must now be contemplated, probably not under 50,000.Russian Cruiser cAIHIRALMHHIMOV1 remains at Odossr All other ships were removed.      ADMIRAL NAKHIM0VJ is 70J6 oomplete, without guns and parts of machinery.The Cabinet has decided (20*2*20) that the evacuation of British troops from Batotun is not to proceed any further pending the dooision on a proposal that a joint allied force should &quot;hold tho port until its future destination has been decided by the Peace Conference.
CASPIAN.   &apos;The Volunteer* gunboat &quot;GRETS1A&quot; arrived at Enzeli from Petrovsk on 10th February.   The Commanding Officer said he had orders to remain as Guardship at Enzeli indefinitely.War Office have informed General Holman that in view of the disappearance of Russian control in Persia the term &quot;Guardship&quot; is not applicable and that this is to be made perfectly clear to General Denikin.It is recognised that the fall of Krasnovodsk, the possible fall of Petrovsk and the improbability of coming to terms with the Azerbaijan Government as regards Baku, may leave Denikin1 s fleet with no alternative but Enzeli and other Persian ports.   Persia, and Great Britain under treaty obligation to her, are bound to take all possible measures to prevent aggression.Accordingly the only condition under which any of Denikinfb ships could be;received at Enzeli are - ;(a) that the ships are to be turned over intact to British control;(b) that a maintenance party, not exceeding 16 per ship, is to remain on board;(c) remainder of officers and men will be transported via Bagdad to a Russian port to be agreed upon;(d) the Russian flag will not be flown by such vessels while at Enzeli.On February 13th the Intelligence Officer at Enzeli reports S.S. &quot;EQUATOR&quot; arrived there from Krasnovodsk with Volunteer troops.   She had been unable to reach Petrovsk owing to engine trouble.Commanding Officer stated they left Krasnovodsk noon 6th February under Bolshevik fire and at that time th0 Bolsheviks were entering the town.   A1J. ships got away.   Oil stores were fired but considerable quantity of wheat, fodder and ammunition were abandoned.EGYPT.Rear Admiral, Egypt in &quot;CAESAR&quot; will leaVe Port Said 1st March for Malta and England.C H.I n A.&quot;TITANIA&quot; and 6 MLrt class submarines forming the 2nd half of China Submarine Flotilla, whb have been at Malta since November, resumed their passage to China on 18th February.&quot;CAIRO&quot; with Rear Admiral 5th Light Cruiser Squadron arrived at Vladivostock 11th February..    NORTH AMERICA AND WEST INDIES.Commander-in-Chief left Bermuda on 21st February to pay his official visit to Washington.   He will return to Bermuda 1st March.ITALY.i.i nil i, in.A forecast of the development of the Italian Navy during the next few years says that the guidlhg principle will be to maintain a Navy at. least two thirds the strength of that of France, and as the latter has recently issued her new programme,
the Italian one may shortly be expected.It is understood that no more battleships are to be constructed, but the five at present existing are to be kept , in first class repair and made to last as long as possible. The laying down of two very fast 28,000 ton battle cruisers mounting 8 - 15&quot; guns has been mentioned, but finances will not &apos;% allow this at present and- no plans have been drawn up.    As sooif-as funds permit, and in view of the new French.programme, it is % hoped to lay dov/n four or six light cruisers, presumably of more,/ or less our &quot;Hawkins&quot; type, which is considered ideal.It is thought that for at least the next four years the estimates can never exceed  5,000,000*The personnel of the Navy has been reduced to 2,500 officers and 25,000 men, tho proportion of officers being only provisional.At present in all yards, including the Royal Dockyards, everything has to give way to new mercantile marine construction.As regards Flotilla Leaders and T* B. Ds the intention is to keep up a   strength of 8 of the former and 50 of the latter, building new ones as others become obsolete. &apos;&apos;B:IThe type of flotilla leader favoured is of 1800 - 2000 tons, 36 knots and mounting 6&quot; or 4.7&quot; guns.   Admiral Sechi favours the 4.7.The type of destroyer favoured is 850 tons, 36 knots -and 4 - 4.7, the speed to be realisable under full active service conditions.A big programme of submarines, not above 1000 tons at most may be looked for, and also of CM.Bs for coast protection.Visit of Japanese Squadron.-The Japanese Squadron has arrived at Naples, and Admiral HORINCHI and his staff have come to Rome bringing a sword of honour for the Minister of Marine and another for Admiral di Reval as gifts from the Emperor of Japan.   The Japanese officers have been received by the King and various festivities have been arranged in their honour, but unfortunately their visit has clashed with that of the Shah of Persia.The Japanese Admiral Kato is also at present on a visit to this Country, where he is making a tour of ship-building yards and armament factories.The Italian battleship &quot;ROMA&quot; is proceeding for an extended tour to show the flag to the various South American Republics.MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE *U *S .S* &quot;Chattanooga&quot; arrived Rosyth from Harwich 18th February, in connection with the ex-German Men-of-War allotted to America.Charge under D.0.R.A. at Rotherham.    On the 14th February, John F. Hedley, ex-Stoker R.F.R. was brought up on remand, charged with making false statements as to the conduct of the War at sea (Summary No.5).
