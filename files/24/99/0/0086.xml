Mr. Lloyd Cc.&apos; ..^e to M.Vaida-Voevad.(Circulated for Information).10, Downing Street, S.Yu.1. t3rd March, 1920.Your Excellency,I have the honour to inform you, on behalf of the Peace Conference, that the Supreme Counoil have to-day oonaidered the demands addressed to them by Your Excellency touching the recognition by the Conference of the reunion of Bessarabia with Itaania.     I take this opportunity of reminding Your Excellency that the decision of this question by the Peace Conference was adjourned till the Rumanian Government had carried out the evacuation of Hungary. The Supreme Counoil have, however, taken note of the pledge given them by Your Excellency on the 26th -February that the evacuation of the Rumanian troops should not be delayed beyond the dates fixed by the Inter-Allied Mission to be dispatched to the spot.     The Council, therefore, in consideration of this, have agreed on the annexed form!a is recognition of the reunion of Bessarabia and Rumania, This recognition oannot, however, be embodied into the legal form of a Treaty till such time as Rumanian troops have completely evacuated Hungary.In this connection I have to refer to the question raiged by the Rumanian Grorejument of making peace with the Soviet Government of Russia.    The Supreme- Council would refer    In reply to the statement contained in their communique of the 2nd i*ebruary. -   Prom this you will observe that the Supreme Council are agreed that they cannot accept the responsibility of advising Rumania to continue a war which may be injurious to their interests,     btill less could they advise Rumania to adopt a policy of aggression towards&apos;Russia. Should, however, Soviet Russia attack Rumania within its legitimate frontiers the Allies will give her every possible support.    The Conference consider that the present recognition by themselves of the reunion of Bessarabia with Rumania should remove the chief obstacle to any such negotiations between the Government of Russia and Rumania as the Government of Rumania may consider advisable.I have the honour to be,Your Excellency^ one die nt servant,(Sd.) D. LLOYD GEORGE.Hie Excellenoy,M. Vai&amp;a-Voevod
-   SIAIBMHT OF SUPREME COUNCIL onJpSS.AR.ABIA.\The PrlnaipaXJllied Powers have hitherto found them-selves unable to make any definite decision on the iessarabiaiL-.-question both ceoause they considered it a part of the general Roumanian question on which difficulties with the former Roumanian Government had impeded a settlement and because they had hoped that it would be found possible to bring about a friendly arrangement between Roumania and Russia. There appears to the Principal Allied Powers no reason any further t* delay a settlement.    The Roumanian (government^rsfcefit have sh^wn proof of their desire to settle in the interest of Roumania and Europe generally the outstanding guestions aft issue and have submitted to the ruling *  the Supremo Council on the question ef the withdrawal ef their troops from Hungary, relying an the assurance of the Principal Allied powers.     Tho Allied Governments,moreover feel that in the best interest both of Roumania and neighbouring countries the Besearabian question should no linger be left undecided.After taking into full consideration th* general aspirations of the population of Bessarabia and tha Moldavian oharaetar&apos;of that region from the geographical and ethnographical points ef view, as well as the historic and eoenomic arguments, the Principal Allied Powers pronounce themselves, therefore, in     , favour o  the reunion of Bessarabia with H$umania which has now been formally declared by the Bessarabian representatives and are desirous to conclude a treaty in recognition of this as soon as the conditions stated have been carried out.    They consider that in this reunion the general and particular interest; of Bessarabia should(. be safeguarded, more especially as regards its relations with the neighbouring countries and that the rights of minorities in it should be guaranteed on the same terms as those residing in other parts of the Roumanian Kingdom.    The Prinoipal Allied Powers reserve the right to refer any future difficulties that might arise from either of these two questions to the arbitration of the league af Nations. rd. 19 d.
