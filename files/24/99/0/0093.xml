(P 1602)   From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 3rd March 1920.(Received 3rd at 11.30 p.nr.)Clear the Line.252 S. Our telegram ol the 29th January, 119 S. A.mir&apos;s letter, to the King about Khalafat. Fresh letter .from Amir to me dated 23rd February arrived 2n.d March pointing out in most friendly and. temperate language that by tradition Khalifa must exercise full and independent authority, and Holy Places (Agabag apparently includes Baghdad, Jerusalem, and Damascus) should remain under Khalifa&apos; standard and free even from presence of. nom-Moslem authorities. Amir says feelings of consternation caused by reports of intentions of Powers have now spread to Moslems of Turkestan, Bokhara, Khiva, and Ferghana who have sent their representatives to him to express their grief. The remedy which he has devised in order to allay excitement is to send a deputation of persons elected by his nation to England to appear before King-Emperor to represent their feelings and acquaiut themselves with real intentions of European nations regarding Khalifat. He asks me to inform him without delay as to what reception and facilities will be given to such deputation, and also what are real intentions of British Government regarding Khalifat and Holy Places. Amir&apos;s motives probably are first to pose as champion of Islam, secondly to take lead in combination of Central Asian Moslem communities thus furthering his well-known ambitions in that direction, thirdly to get into direct diplomatic touch with. London and perhaps discuss generally questions of British and Afghan relations. I am inclined to think that it would be unwise to rebuff him in this matter. First, the proposal to leave Sultan with only shadow of former authority at Constantinople &quot;and to include Baghdad and Jerusalem under British mandate will almost certainly not be held by Amir to satisfy requirements of Moslem tradition, especially as Afghans have special veneration for two famous Sunni shrines at Baghdad. It would seem best, therefore, to allow his deputation to go to Europe to discover difficulties for themselves, and delay in giving final reply would be all to good, as it would tide us over hot weather. Secondly, Amir;s Central Asian ambitions seem rapidly to be bringing him into&apos;disagreement with Bolsheviks, and it might do no harm to show that we do not frown upon these ambitions, while, of course, not committing ourselves to support (corrupt group). Thirdly, Avhile we recognise possible dangers in direct relatious between Kabul and London, we- do not think present occasion need serve as inconvenient precedent, since it would be easy for&apos; His Majesty ^Government to confine discussion to point immediately at issue, and we consider it is of paramount importance to keep Afghanistan quiet doling coming hot weather and autumn, provided this can be effected without sacrifice of our dignity. Fourthly, sending of Afghan deputation to London would form counter-blast to recent deputation to Moscow, and would possibly hasten detachment of Afghans from Bolsheviks. We would therefore suggest that reply should go at once to Amir that all facilities will be given to proposed deputation to.visit England, provided it is of moderate numbers,, and provided it does not include any persons who from their past attitude have rendered it obviously impossible for the British Government to facilitate their passage through British dominions,(this would be necessary for purpose of excluding such persons as Barkatulla). We could, if this reply were approved, evade answering directly AnuYs - enquiry as to, British Governments intentions about Turkey, pointing out that it would-be best that the deputation should ascertain these fully themselves on the spot. We trust that you will find it possible to telegraph your decision very early.
