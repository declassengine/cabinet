According to telegram from Northern Frontier, 25th February, &quot;Bolsheviks are despatching troops and guns from Kizil Arvat to Gumbad-i-Kabuz through Yamut country.&quot;2. It is not clear whether this is merely attempt to assert Russian rights in that place, or whether it is part of a larger scheme to create trouble in Persia.&quot;3, I have directed my officer at Bujnurd to make every effort to find out -what is going on, and I suggest Intelligence Officer now en route to Caspian coast should receive similar instructions through Tehran.&quot;
