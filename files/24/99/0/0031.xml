r\ is the Property of &apos; Government.f^pMilitary Secret.3/ From Ficiceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India 20th February 1920.(Received 24th.)13012311.   Malleson wires 18th February : &quot; Merv, 5th February. During first live days of February, 8 trains passed through Merv eastward, four of these conveyed troops from the front going to rest quarters, three had sick and prisoners, and one was special containing high officials.&quot; 2. No troops passed west but some trains with camels from Taslikend side went towards Askabad.&quot; 3. Large number of camels are being collected in Merv district. Various reasons given for this, but invasion of Persia not mentioned.&quot;4. Merv is now a different place from what it was few months ago. New officials have done away with all injustice and abuses. Bolsheviks are giving compensation for all damage done to property. Turcomans, assured of payment, freely bring their produce to market. People attribute these changes to the influence of Kuropatkin, who is described as &apos; Second minister of Turcomans.&apos;&quot;Presence of General Kuropatkin in Turkestan is confirmed by reports from Polish prisoners of war. Latter state also that General Brusiloff is at Skobeleff apparently directing operations against Ferghana insurgent. He is described as having a limp and is therefore probably the well-known General of this name who lost a leg early  in the revolution.
