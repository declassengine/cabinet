(This Dqch^&apos; His Sniaated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of Statefor lndiax dated 21st February 1920.(Repealed to Teheran and Meshed.)204 S. We have considered in Council your telegram, Army Department, of 10th February, regarding military position in South and East Persia. In South, we desire earliest possible withdrawal..j;2. East Persia.-General Officer Commanding, Qnetta Division, estimates that withdrawal will take five months to complete as length of route and lack of water necessitate withdrawal in small echelons. If it began in March when snow has melted, it might thus not bef complete until August.3. Khorasan. From purely military standpoint dangers to be apprehended to Khorasan are either Bolshevik attack in force or Afghan attack. As you point out, Mallesou&apos;s force could not resist serious Bolshevik attack, and. though its withdrawal as far asBirjand only would enable it to remain menace to Bolsheviks, its maintenance there would become excessively inconvenient, as it would be deprived of local supplies now obtainable round Meshed. Regarding Afghan attack on Khorasan, this, if it were to constitute casus belli between British Government and Afghanistan, could be best met by attacking Afghanistan from side of India, although immediate power to ward off Afghan attacks on Persian side would be lessened by withdrawal. Malleson considers main military value of present position at Meshed is as outpost bridge over Central Asia. Maintenance of our present military intelligence system could be secured by leaving Military Attache in Khorasan with small escort to Consulate and two or three British officers. Thus, so. far as military considerations are concerned, withdrawal is unobjectionable.4. From political standpoint we offer following observations : (1) Although we recognise that Anglo-Persian agreement does not technically commit British Government to defence of present Persian regime, public opinion in the East almost certainly hold that His Majesty&apos;s Government are morally committed, as was foretold in our telegram of 480 S , dated 24th April 1919. Bolsheviks may not contemplate early military attack on Persia, but there is undoubtedly in Persian eyes distinct threat of such attack, and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to withdraw all forces in the face of this threat, may expose them to charges of breach of faith, and react on position not only in Persia but in Afghanistan, making our relations with latter more difficult. While pointing this out we do not wish to base any recommendation on it, since maintenance of British reputation in Persia is not mainly Indian interest and effect on our relations with Afghanistan, though possibly important, can only be indirect. (2) More imminent and real danger is that Bolsheviks, while abstaining from military attack, will Hood Khorasan with emissaries and propagandas, with object of causing armed risings against local Persian Administration Avhich they represent to be under British domination. This danger has so far been averted by presence of British forces at Khorasan, though Malleson now reports signs of fraternisation of Persian Customs officials and gendarmerie with Bolsheviks. Rebellion, of Khorasanat Bolshevik instigation would probably affect the British position at Teheran, reacting on Afghanistan almost as much as Bolshevik military attack. We believe that danger of such risings would be lessened if fairly strong escorts were left for Meshed Gon-sulate, and if Khorasan levies were to remain under British officers, but to be paid for by Persian Government, and be incorporated in new uniform force. There would of course be danger that levies might become infected with Bolshevism, and attack their British officers, but if we are to make any attempt to put drags on Bolshevising of Khorasau, we fear this risk must be faced. This measure, coupled with fact that withdrawal of British regular forces cannot be complete till August, may tide over dangerous period of next spring and summer.5.&apos; Tract between Birjand and Duzdap. There are 1,750 Seistati levies under British officers in this tract. Many of them former noted raiders and their sudden disbandment would encourage Afghan raiding on British trade caravans and produce disorder in country. Consul at Seistan recommends retention of fairly strong Seistan Consular cavalry escort and gradual disbandment of such of Seistan levies (corrupt group) as cannot be absorbed into new uniform force payable by Persia.   We propose10 1068     100 3.20Mr. Longhurst.Property ofGovernment) nna---    &apos;   299
.:-      lor-titiix   &apos; tu      &apos; i  &apos; \   .;;-!:&apos;&amp;kto retain small mobile detachment at Duzdap to protect the railhead and dumps of goods there.6. Sarhad and (corrupt group) Baluchistan Sarhad tribes are kept in order by small garrison at Khvvas and by tribal subsidies and Sarhad levy payments. Khwas Garrison also dominates Bampur and its withdrawal without substitution of Persian authority which does not exist might encourage Bahrain Khan to repeat his raid upon British cantonment. We wish for the present to maintain reduced regular Garrison at Khwas and continue tribal subsidies and levy payments.7. Exact wording of the summary. We recommend the retention of the Consular escort, one-and-a-half Cavalry Squadrons at Meshed and half Squadron at Seistan, some light armoured cars at Meshed and possibly Ford van transport. Persia to take over Khorasan levies in present strength and Seistan levies in reduced strength, both under British officers; small regular mobile detachment at Duzdap ; reduced garrison at Khwas and maintenance of present tribal and levy payments in Sarhad. Of foregoing, cost of Consular escort at Meshed and Seistan including all contingent charges will be borne half and half by His Majesty&apos;s Government and India, cost of Khorasan and Seistan levies with their officers by Persia. Conditionally on these arrangements we are prepared to meet the cost of Duzdap and Khwas detachments, and payments for this redistribution of cost might have effect when withdrawal of the forces is complete.
