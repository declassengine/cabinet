C A B I NET.   &apos;TREATY OF PEACE WITH TURKEY MILITARY AND AIR CLAUSES. PJPJL.of .1  JLljOLfrom Mr, Lloyd George to Marshal Poch. ( Circulated for informat ion.)10, Downing Street, London.3rd March, 1920.Monsieur le Marechal,I have the honour to inform you that the Supreme Council of the Allied Powers have to-day considered, the Report of the Military Representatives at Versailles on the draft military and air clauses for insertion in the Treaty of Peace with Turkey for-warded with your letter No. 1-05/2 of 2oth february, 1920.I am asked to inform you that the Supreme Council are /strongly of opinion that the strength of   &apos; 5*0,000 - 60,000 men proposed in.Article 10 of the draft clauses is very excessive as compared with the number^ relative to population, of the military forces allowed to Germany and Austria &quot;by the Treaties of Peace with those countries, and having regard to the limited financial resources of Turkey.The feeling.of the Council was that the maintenance of order in Turkey is rather a question for a Turkish gendarmerie. They accordingly request the Military Representatives to re-consider Article 10 with a view to a substantial reduction in the strength of the military forces to be allowed to Turkey, and at the same time to consider the creation of a Turkish gendarmerie under the control of Allied officers.   For this latter purpose the Allied Powers have agreed to add to the Military Representa-tives at Versailles experts in the organisation of gondarmsrie forces in Eastern countries, and the selected, officers will be instructed to report themselves to you at an early date.I should be glad if you would communicate these decisions to the Military Representatives with a view to an early re-examination of this aspect of the military terms.I have the honour to be,Monsieur le Marechal,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)    D. LLOYD GEORGE.M. le Marechal Foch.,1
