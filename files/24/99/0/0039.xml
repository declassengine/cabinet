CLEAR THE LINE.

1055, Feb. 24th. Part I

Owing to invaders (2 groups undes.) politicians who believe that we are negociating with Bolsheviks and war weariness Kuban Cossacks are not (?) fighting and consequently are not preventing serious threats by Greens to Novorossisk and Petrovsk railway.   ? Denikin is deciding to consider in re measures to be taken if Kubans threw up the sponge. He will probably withdraw Volunteer Corps and Green and Terek Cossacks on Novorossick or Crimes.  Moment of extreme ? danger for families of officers contemplated by Meckinder and myself has arrived . (?) Some 8,000 are now at Novorossick in circumstances of great misery 8,000 more at Ekaterinodar and 5, 000 in (3 groups unded.)

Part 2.

(4 groups undecipherable) Novorossick was made painful owing to unfortunate suspension of ? evacuation.  It will be extremely difficult to (?) extricate them now.  I have concentration of about 200 officers other ranks at Ekaterindar in order to make good our promises to Denikin.  A hope His Majesty&apos;s Government are not really deceived by Bolshevist promises of reform. (?) Awful (?) atrocities they have committed ought to have shown clearly what will be fate of those unfortunate women and children if they fall into their hands.   Should we abandon the last remnants of that section of Russian nation which has been faithful to us we are branded with indelible (?) shame. I most urgently urge that all available transport and battleships be sent at once to Novorossick and to  Egypt and Malta be forced to take their share.
