Council on February 26th,- 1920) (See also C.P.662 and CP.722)L 0 Jf D 0 I(February 26, 1920,The Prime Ministers of France and Great Britain welcome the oommunibation which they have today received from the President of the United States in answer to their Memorandum of February 17th.     They wish to 2&apos;ecord their appreciation of the recognition giVen therein by President Wilson to the attitude of the French and British Governments concerning the Adriatic settlement. The French and British Prime Ministers are once again glad to repeat the&apos;assurance given by them in the Memorandum of January 22nd that they &quot;have never had the intention of making a definite settlement of the questions raised without obtaining the views of the American Government,&quot;    A further explanation of these views., which is -supplied in the Memorandum under reply, Is therefore for the French and British Governments a matter of very great interest and importance, all the more since it shows that the United states Government do not wish to disinterest themselves from the general question of peaoe.
Tiie absence of any American representative has proved in practice an almost insurmountable obstacle to the success of negotiations and to the acceptance by the parties concerned of an equitable solution in conformity alike with the principles of the Peace Conference and of the legitimate though conflicting aspirations of the Italian and Jugo-Slav peoples.They note, as a fact of the greatest importance that the President of the United States expresses his willingness to accept any settlement &quot;mutually agreeable to Italy and Jugo-Slavia regarding their common frontier in the Piume region, provided that such an agreement is not made on the bas$s of compensation elsewhere at the expense of nationals of a third power.&quot;This, the French and British Prime Ministers agree&quot;ttoulftbe the ideal way of settling the questions at Issue, and they are willing to do their utmost to reach a settlement by this road.    In order to facilitate this process they are ready to withdraw the proposals made both on the 9th December and the 20th January, for they feel that if the two parties principally concerned believe that the various Allied and Associated Powers are committed to supporting them in any particular solution, it will be more difficult to secure a voluntary agreement between them;     The French and British Prime Ministers therefore join in a cordial invitation that President Wilson should take part with them in a formal proposal to the Italian and Jugo-Slav Governments urging them to negotiate a mutual agreement on the basic of a withdrawal of all previous proposals.
If, however, this attempt should prove unsuccess-ful, the French and British Prime Ministers agree that the United States, Great Britain and Prance should once more consider the question in common with a view to arriving at concrete proposals..  The French and Eritish Prime Ministers desire fur-ther to record their appreciation of the interest taken by the American Government in the future of the Albanian people, and they assure President Wilson that they share to the full, respect for the principle which he here enunciates.     They would remind him of what they said on the subject in their Memorandum of February 17th and would state that they are convinced that by a reconsider a-tion of the Albanian question a settlement can be reached which will satisfy the aspirations of the Albanian people for full self-government while taking into considera-v tion the vital interests of all other parties concerned, together with the necessity of assuring to Jugo-Slavia an outlet on the Adriatic in the region of Scutari,, They are willing to urge upon the Governments interested, that they should bring their desires into line with the .American point of view.The French and British Prime Ministers must further refer to the observations of President Wilson on the character and applicability of the Treaty of London.    With, regard to this Treaty they feel bound to insist that its &quot;secret character&quot;, to which he objects, was due to the exigencies of military strategy.     The essence of all success in warfare is to pre/enr, divulgation to the enemy of important plans, whether of a military or political
character, and the Treaty, on the faith of which Italy entered the war, was not one which could he published during hostilities without detriment to the Allied cause.With regard to their statement that in the event of an amicable settlement not being arrived at between Italy and Jugo-Slavia, the Treaty of London would have to come into force, so far as they are concerned, the French and British Prime Ministers feel that they need add little to the explanations they have already given in the Memorandum of February 17th.   The Italian Govern-ment have co-operated most loyally and assiduously with the French and British Governments in endeavouring to sub-stitute for the arrangements for the Treaty of London a settlement which would be satisfactory alike to them and to jugo-slavia.   Such an agreement would obviously replace and annul the Treaty of London with the consent of Italy herself.   That such an agreement should be reached is the cordial hope of all the Allied Governments, a hope which they know President 7/ilson shares to tfte full, but they cannot disguise the fact that should no voluntary settlement of thi3 kind be attained, the Treaty of London, to which they set their hand in 1915, would then become the only valid alternative so far as they were concerned.In conclusion, the French and British prime Ministers venture to call the attention of president 7/ilson to the urgent importance of a speedy settlement of the Adriatic dispute - a dispute which is now gravely threatening the peace and delaying the reconstruction of South Eastern Europe.   -(Sgd.)
