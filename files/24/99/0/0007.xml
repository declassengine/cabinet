(CP. 585 and 586.)WINSTON S. CHURCHILL,The War Office,20th February, 1920.NOTE BY THE GENERAL STAFF ON THE POSSIBILITY OF REDUCING THE GARRISON OF MESOPOTAMIA TO 4,000 BRITISH AND 16,000 INDIAN TROOPS.1. The chief reason that led to our campaign in Mesopotamia at the commencement of the war, was the necessity of protecting the Persian oilfields in the vicinity of Ahwaz, the produce of which was essential for our Navy. The further advance to Baghdad and Mosul was undertaken partly for political reasons and partly owing to the necessity of dealing with the Turkish field armies, whose existence Avas a continual menace to our hold on the oilfields.Our chief strategic consideration, to-day is the same as it was before the war, namely, to secure an uninterrupted supply of oil for the Navy, but having committed ourselves to the occupation of this vast territory, a territory surrounded and populated by Mahomedans, any attempted withdrawal at the present moment may lead us into difficulties that would not have arisen had our advance in the first instance been limited.2. To hold Baghdad (alone as is sometimes suggested) means withdrawal of all our forces north of that place, who at present are in a position to quell disorder immediately it should arise. During the last year we have had unfortunate incidents near Zakho, at Sulemaniyah, near Amadia, and with the Zibar tribe north of Akra. There is little doubt that the indecisive policy as regards Turkey is mainly responsible for the state of disorder in Southern and Central Kurdistan, in that it gives an opportunity to the Turkish National Party to play upon the feelings of the Kurds by anti-British propaganda, To our ability in each case to strike swiftly and surely at the heart of the trouble may be attributed the fact that we have not had to face a united and hostile Kurdistan.To the west and north-west, too, we have Arab tribes who at any moment may be worked up to attack us, as was the case lately when Ramadhan Shalash attacked Deir-es-Zor. Ramadhan Shalash has recently left for Aleppo but his successor Maulad Pasha is actively inciting the tribes throughout Mesopotamia to active revolt and rebellion. Like Ramadhan Shalash, he too has been threatening the lives of our Political Officers. The Hammar tribe between the Tigris and the Euphrates north of Baghdad needs little encouragement to start a campaign of pillage.Moreover, the ease with which orientals misinterpret any retrograde movement as a sign of weakness must not be forgotten. Any withdrawal at present would have a serious effect on the internal condition of Mesopotamia, and might well involve us in grave internal disorders.In fact, it seems almost certain that to withdraw and confine ourselves to the holding of Baghdad and the river or railway line as suggested, even if this were possible^20/112)  100  2/20 H&amp;s  7972wo
with the force proposed, will involve us in such difficulties both within and without, the troops so withdrawn will have to be retained in the country in order to meet them. By such action on our part the Bolsheviks, the Turkish Nationalists, and the uncertain Arab elements will receive further encouragement in their schemes for the overthrow of our authority in Mesopotamia.To limit ourselves to the occupation and protection of Baghdad is moreover to abandon the Line of Commutation thence to Hamadan, which as has been shown recently is essential if the Bolshevik menace develops and we are to meet it, Similarly it involves the complete abandonment of Persia and the stultification of the engage-ments recently undertaken towards her.3. It is considered that at the present time and for many months to come any attempt to hold Baghdad and the Line of Communication to Basra with the force suggested is to invite disaster. If, as the Secretary of State implies,-the intention is to retain Baghdad, we should keep our troops at the strength and in the positions that they are at present.It will not be forgotten that eventually it is hoped to reduce the garrison of Mesopotamia to about one division, replacing troops released by Arab gendarmerie maintained entirely at the expense of Mesopotamia revenue.4. Looking to the future, the possibility of Mesopotamia paying its way within a reasonable time depends greatly on whether the vilayet of Mosul is included or not. The economic potentialities of this district are immense and it would be an act of extremely short-sighted policy to throw away the best chance ,we have of recouping ourselves for the outlay already incurred.5. If it is decided that the garrison must be reduced to the numbers suggested, the most that can be safely done with a force of this size is to retain possession of the area which has Basra for the centre and Nasarie on the Euphrates, Amarah on the Tigris, and the oilfields near Ahwaz on the circumference.6. The possibility of an early reduction in the garrison of Mesopotamia is contingent on the attitude of the Mahomedan factions by which it is surrounded. All have their eyes at present fixed on Constantinople, and a reasonable peace with Turkey will, in itself, go far towards paving the way to a contented Mahomedan world, reducing, proportionately, our military responsibilities not only in Mesopotamia but in all other Mahomedan countries.7. In this connection the General Staff have, for many months, repeatedly pointed out that the policy of antagonizing the Turks, and thereby embittering the whole Mussulman world, was involving us in unnecessary expense at the present time and laying up for us untold liabilities in the future.
