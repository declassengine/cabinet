THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QB&apos; HIS BRITANNIt^MA^E&amp;TT^GCVE^^A b i /V X. .p. %mPARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS L.G.22Postponement, of Counting of the VotesMemorandum by the Minister of Health.In accordance with the decision of the..Home Affairs Committee (49 (3) )&apos;  I circulate for consideration a note on the subject of the interval which now elapses between the poll and the counting of the votes.(1)   The practical consideration of allowing time for balloi papers to be issued to and returned by absent voters between the date of -nomination and the date of the count racessitated the. count being deferred for a period after the poll.    At present the count takes place on the eleventh day after the poll, the whole interval between nomination and the count being thus 19 days, or in the case of a bye-election, not less than 16 days and not more than 19 days excluding Sundays.(2)   This full period has hitherto been deemed necessary to ensure absent voters having an opportunity of recording their votes.    But with the reduction of the Forces/serving abroad, and the improvement of. cornmunications, it has recently been found possible to.arrange for the transit of ballot papers to and from voters within a shorter period. The Government Departments concerned (General Post Office, War Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry) advise that a period of 12 clear days (excluding Sunday) between\nomination and the count would meet the case of the most distant units con-cerned,   viz., the-Force8 on the Rhine, , So far, however, as their departmental  responsibility is concerned, those departments hold the view that any less period would deprive the Forces on the Rhine and (in all probability)
&amp;a proportion of the men of the Fleet on Home Stations, of an opportunity of receiving and returning ballot papers in time for the count, and would proportionately curtail the voting facilities of men in Prance.(3)   I am not satisfied myself that the time table which they furnish could not be curtailed.     It is   shown in a note at the end of this paper.(4)   The numbers of&apos; the forces concerned are approximately.On the Rhine .......-......................... 26,500France ......-----............, 30,500ftavy - Home Stations and Watersincluding Scapa Plow...................100,000Some of the above-mentioned men are, of course, not voters. ;. ....(5)   But even so substantial a reduction would not wholly extinguish the interval between the poll and the count.    As the maximum period between nomination and the poll is1 eight days, an interval of. at least   four days would remain betv/een the poll and the count;   and this interval might, in the case of a bye-election, be as long as seven.. . If, however, it is desired to reduce the Interval still further., or to extinguish it wholly, then expedients will need to be adopted which involve political or ministerial considerations.   The following expedients may* i &apos;   ,ibe mentioned.(6)   If the interval between nomination and the poll were extended to 12 days, then sufficient time would be afforded for the transit of ballot papers to and from absent voters without deferring the count, which could take place the day after the. poll.    But this would require legislation; while so long a period as 12 days will not always be required..(7)   Alternatively, all areas abroad could for the
purpose of naval and military voters be treated as proxy areas.    This would not require legislation.    All men in the Navy serving afloat can already appoint proxiea.     But only a few of them have appointed proxies;   and to require all men in the Forces serving abroad to vote by proxy might be regarded as a curtailment of their franchise, both on account of the probability that they will omit to take the necessary &quot;steps and also because proxy voting may not be regarded as an effective: means of the personal exercise of the franchise.(8)   To -sum up, the re-f ore, the aItemative s are: -(a) To reduce the period between nomination and count to 12 days, this involving an internal between poll and count of from 4 to 7 days, but usually (and in the case of general elections, always)4 days.If this reduction is insutfficient:-(b) To increase the period between nomination and the poll to 12 days fixed, or(c) To make all areas abroad proxy areas.- in both of which cases the count could take place on the day after the poll. . Paragraph (b) alone would require legislation.-   C.
