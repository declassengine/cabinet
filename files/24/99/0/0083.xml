252(P 1438)Mr. Longhurst.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,2nd March 1920.Priority A.Foreign Secret. Your telegram No. 202 S., dated 20th February. Afghanistan. Amir&apos;s reply, taken in conjunction with what we actually know of his negotiations with Bolsheviks down to middle of January, and with Nadir Khan&apos;s activities on the frontier,&quot;seems most unsatisfactory and affords little hope that conference will lead to any useful result. But policy to be adopted now must depend largely on considerations of military strength, and it would seem advisable to avoid any course of action that would be likely to lead to open rupture before you are ready to take the field and advance, if necessary, to Kabul and Kandahar. I assume that this will hardly be before the autumn, but I should be glad to have the latest military opinion on this point. In the meantime, unless the Amir, contrary to expectation, gives proof of a genuine desire for peace on possible terms, the only practicable course appears to be to keep him in play as long as possible, and to proceedjwith the conference seems the best means of doing so.  Terms of proposed letter to Amir are, therefore, approved.Your further comments are awaited, but I consider that in any case it should be made plain to Afghan delegates from the first that conference is purely preliminary one which will not necessarily pave the way to second stage of negotiations contem-plated in Article 4 of Peace Treaty. Whether any progress is made in that direction, will depend on Afghan&apos;s own attitude at conference. Great care should be taken that there is no repetition of the episode of the armed escort.Please let me hear as soon as possible what line yon propose to take at the conference.
