PHIS DOCUMENT II) THE PROPIETY OP HIS BhlTAHNIC MAJ.3STT S GOV13K1JM5NT).$OglDSHTIAI. ,P. 752.CABINET.iSSUr, QF.QJ?PIOIAb AHjj PAELIAivKHTABY PAPliHS TO rJH-3 PRESS. Instructions to Departments.1. ,    The practice followed by Government Departments during the War of issuing documents to the Press marked, for publication not before a certain date should, as a general rule, cease.2.      An exception should usually be made in the case of long and detailed official documents or communiques (which are not Parliamentary Papers) particularly those containing a mass of figures which cannot readily be telegraphed.     In these exceptional cases each of the copies supplied to the Press should be clearly marked that publication must not take place until a certain date and time.    Usually the document or documents should be issued so as to reach the newspaper offices by 10 a.m, on the morning preceding the date of publication.3.        In these exceptional cases where long documents of the class referred to in 2, are issued in advance to the Press, they are to be issued to the whole Press without preference, no priority being given to any newspaper or group of newspapers, provided that technical and professional papers published otherwise than daily may, at the discretion of the Department concerned, receive such documents for in advance of consideration, the lay Press.though not for publication or comment,4.       The responsibility for giving docruments of the class referred to in 2 to the Press rests with the Government Departments concerned.5.       Every endeavour must be made by the Government Depart-ments concerned to, deliver the document or documents early in the day and, if possible, advise the newspapers the day before, by^post or telephone, that the document or documents will be available the following morning.   It is necessary to provide the newspapers with copies as early as possible in the morning since in the case of the Provincial Press the news ha3 to be telegraphed to the country.6.        The procedure in regard to the distribution of Parliament-ary Papers will remain as it stands at present, such distribution being made by the Stationery Office.     It is a breach of privelege of Parliament to give any copies of Parliamentary Papers to the      v Press or to any persons whatsoever before copies have been made available to members of both Houses in the oase of Command Papers, or to Peers or to M,?s., in the case of House of Lords or House Commons Papers respectively.2 Whitehall Gardens, o 28th February, 1920.b
