-ALLIED POLICY III RUSSIA, n,xm)NCLUSI03JS REACHED BY THE SUPREME COUNCILfeflALU^s^ on FEBRUARY 24th, 1920.The Allied Governments have agreed on the following ConclusionsIf the communities which &quot;border on the frontiers of Soviet Russia, -and whose independence or de facto autonomy,they have recognised, were to approach them and to ask for advice as to what attitude they should take with regard to Soviet Russia, the Allied Governments would reply that they cannot accept the responsibility of advising thorn to continue a war which may be injurious to&apos;their own interests.     Still less would they advise them to adopt a policy of aggression towards Russia.     If, however, Soviet Russia attacks them inside their legitimate frontiers, the Allies will give them every possible support.The Allies cannot enter into diplomatic relations with the Soviet. Government in view of their past experiences until they have1 arrived at the conviction that Bolshevist horrors have come to an ,end, and that the Government of Moscow is ready to conform its methods and diplomatic Aar&amp;uct to those of&apos; all civilised Governments.    The British and Swiss Governments Were both compelled to espel representatives of the Soviet Government from their respective countries because these had abused their privileges.     Commerce between Russia and the rest&apos;of Europe:, which is so essential for the improvement of economic conditions, not only in Russia, but in the rest of the world, will be encouraged to the utmost degree possible without relaxation of the attitude described above.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., February 24, 1920.Furthermore, the Allies agree in the belief that it is highly desirable to obtain impartial and. authoritative inform-ation regarding the conditions now prevailing in Russia *   They have therefore noted with satisfaction the proposal before the International Labour Bureau, which is a branch of the League of Nations, to send a Commission of Investigation to Russia, to examine the facts.   They think, however, that this inquiry would be invested with even greater authority, and with super-ior chances of success, if it were made upon the initiative, and conducted under the supervision, of the Council of the League of Nations itself, and they invite that body to take action in this direction.
