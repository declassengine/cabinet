The trade representatives will leave the Committee when thjir particular trade is finished with and representatives of other trades will take their place.II am asking the Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations to nominate the two permanent employers, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to nominate two permanent labour representatives.
