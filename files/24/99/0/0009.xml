[THIS DOCITjCTT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITALIC MAJESTY&apos;S GCVSTOraTT ]:CT, C A B I IT 3 T ...709 . EXPORT 0? FSR^-ISERS .Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. It is a matter of supreme importance that the farmershould be able to obtain an adequate supply of fertilisers at reasonable prioes;   otherwise the Government policy of stimulating and developing the production of essential food stuffs in the united kingdom cannot be carried out.    In face of the present world shortage of artificial manures, it is certain that adequate supplies to the British farmer can only be secured by a continuance of the Government control of export . 2. The principal artificial fertilisers are (*) Sulphate of ammonia, (b) Nitrate of Soda, (c) Superphosphate of Lime, (d) Basic Slag, (e) Potash.     Of these, Nitrate of Soda and Potash are almost wholly imported. 3. Owing both to the shortage and to the necessity of pre*venting supplies reaching enemy countries, the export of fertilisers during the war was prohibited except under licence. 4. This prohibition is still in force.     The present legal position is given in the following extract from a letter from the Board of Trade, Imports and exports Licensing Section, dated January 22nd:-The export of fertilisers &quot;is at present prohibited by Royal Proclamation or Order in Council issued under section 8 of the Custom:.-; and Inland Revenue Act 1879-as amended by the Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act 1914, and under section / 1 of the Exportation of Arms Act 1900 as amended by the Customs (Exportation Restriction ) Act 1914.The Customs (Importation Restriction) Act 1914 and the Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act 1914, are valid for the period of the present war only and after that date we shall have to f-31 baok on the Acts of 1870 and 1900 above referred to. It is at least doubtful whether the exportation of fertilisers can be prohibited under either of these two Acts, and this is a matter which is being considered by the Board of Trade at the present time.     Assuming for the moment that these Acts do not give power to prohibit the exportation of fertilisers, then this embargo will have to disappear at the end of the war, the date of whioh is, 1 understand, to be determined by Order in Council and may quite possibly be prior to tho 31ct May, 1920&quot;.
It is essential, if Agricultural production is to be stimulated, or even maintained, to retain powers to prohibit the export of Sulphate cf Ammonia, Superphosphate of Lime, Basic Slag and Potash, for the following reasons:-(a) Sulphate of Ammonia.     The release from control would unquestionably lead&quot;&quot;To &quot;a&quot;shortage in this country and to a rise in price estimated at a minimum of  5 per ton and at a maximum even as much as  15 per ton.     Past experience has shown that a rise of  5 per ton would inevitably lead to a fall in the application of nitrogen to the soil (as farmers will not buy at abnormally high prices) with a corresponding reduction In the production of food in this country and an equivalent increase of the necessary imports qf food from abrcad.It is true that supplies of nitrogenous fertilisers in this country may be largely increased by the importation of Nitrate of Soda, and that ultimately the competition of titrate of Soda may stabilise the prices of nitrogenous manures at a level at which the farmer will buy.     How soon this will take place depends on the course of prices of Nitrate of Soda, which is at present upwards and not downwards, and on the amount of shipping available.     The total imports of Nitrate of Soda fell from approximately 172,000 tons in 1914 to 24,000 tons in 1919, and simultaneously the consumption of Sulphate of Ammonia for agricultural purposes rose from about 60,000 tons in 1914 to about 241,000 tons in 1918-19.There is bound to be an interregnum before Nitrate of Soda takes its place in competition with Sulphate of Ammonia;   it is during this period that it will be most necessary to safeguard our home supplies.(b) Superphcsphate.     The Superphosphate Manufacturers in this country have practlcally concluded arrangements for the importation of about 450,000 tens of raw Phosphate Rock from North Africa and America during 1920.     The corresponding figures for 1918 were 465,000 tons, for 1914   562,000 tons.     Of these quantities approximately 1,4 00 tons in 1918 and approximately 98,000 tons in 1914, we re-exported in the form of Superphosphate or raw Phosphate Rock.     The available supplies of Phopphate Rock are therefore barely adequate to meet the home demand.     If supplies to the British farmer are to be secured there is no margin available for export;   at present export licences are being severely restricted.A large rise in price would inevitably result in a reduced application of Superphosphate to the soil and would lead to the same consequence as in the case of Sulphate of Ammonia, namely, a reduction of the amount of home-grown food.Moreover, this country is dependent for the greater part of its supplies of Phosphate Rock on the good will of the French Government, which has allocated the available supplies of North African Rock between the various consuming countries,     If it should subsequently find that an appreciable proportion of the British allocation has been re-exported to other countries in the form of Superphosphate, great difficulty would be experienced in obtaining an equally favourable allocation in the future.(0)   Basic Slag.     Supplies of Basic Slag are at present quite inadequate to meet the home demand.     Figures for production show a falling off both in quality and quantity.     The&apos;total Basic Slag ground between June and December 1919 was 270,000 tons as compared
with 323,000 tons for the corresponding period of 1918. There is little-doubt that free export would lead to a substantial rise in price.In normal circumstances, since the two fertilisers are to some extent interchangeable, this shortage could be met in a small degree by additional supplies of Superphosphate, if sufficient quantities of raw Phosphate Rock were available,    It is, however, highly improbable that any supplies of Phosphate Rock in addition to those referred to above will be obtainable during the present year.   It is, therefore, a matter of equal importance to safeguard the home supplies of Basic Slag, especially as the Ministry&apos;s campaign for the improvement of grass lands, on which a cheap milk supply so largely depends, must be dropped if Basic Slag supplies are likely to be reduced.W   Potash.   Potash is at present being imported from Germany and Alsace.   If the quantities obtained from Alsace are largely increased in the future, the case for restriction of re-export may beoome one of less importance.   It is, however, conceivable that the Prenoh Government might make prohibition of re-export a condition of granting export licences to this country.   It therefore appears to be desirable to retain powers to exercise this prohibition even though ultimately it may prove to be unnecessary.6. How great the foreign demand upon our supplies ofnitrogenous and phosphatic manures during the coming year may be is very difficult to estimate.   It rill depend very largely on thefinancial state of the importing oountries.   w&quot;ere these in aposition to pay, the demand would be very heavy indeed and with free export might have disastrous consequences to british agriculture,Moreover, the free export of fertilisers, under existing conditions, would in the end probably affect the rate of exchange adversely, since the value of the fertilisers exported, whioh otherwise could profitably be applied to the soil in this country, would be greatly exceeded by the cost of the. equivalent amount of food which it would be necessary to import to supplement the diminished home production. -7. Semi-official communications with the Associations of manufacturers of Sulphate of Ammonia, Superphosphate, and Basic Slag., reveal the fact that the majority of makers will not oppose the control of export licences being left in the hands of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for a further period.In these circumstances, I ask the approval of the Cabinet to the continuance of the powers to restrict export of.the above mentioned fertilisers; if necessary by the introduction of a Bill
to control fertiliser export for not more than two years.   In exercising such control, it is understood that licences would he freely granted in respect of any exportable surplus not required by British agriculture.L of P.23rd February, 1920.
