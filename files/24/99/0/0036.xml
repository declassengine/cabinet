71 1  U11 * / sj. //Fro?n yiceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 24th February 1920.(Repeated to Teheran and Meshed.)(Received 24th, 10 p.m.)Clear the line.313 S. Your, telegram of 5th February. Afghan Agents iii Persia. Following-telegram dated 23rd February from Consul-General, Meshed, to Teheran, and repeated here, namely: &quot; (M.) My telegram (? group omitted). Governor-General informs me, in reply to his communication regarding Afghanistan Minister and Consul-General, Governor of Herat, writes that he is keeping back Consul-Generai, but is despatching Minister to Teheran.   His Highness has telegraph(ed) this to Persian Government.&quot;in case he comes through Meshed, do you wish me to recognise his passage in any way ? &quot;- We recommend that Persian Government be advised to direct Governor-General, Khorassan, to allow Abdul Aziz, who is proposed Afghan Minister, to proceed to Teheran and to treat him as private individual only, though with courtesy. If he. brings armed escort with him to frontier, and asks to be allowed to take it into Persia, he might bex informed that he should not bring escort of more than very moderate dimensions. We consider that it Persia were to turn him back from frontier or to insist on his entering entirely without&quot;escort, difficult incident might be created. Our experience here shows that Abdul Aziz is not likely in himself to be formidable factor at Teheran. W^e do not think that our Consul-Generai should recognise him in any way at Meshed.
