(Circulated for information. )The crisis in prices depends prinoipally on the lack of proportion between.production and consumption.     The depreciation in currency., as a result of the increased issue of paper money, is a secondary -factor.To face the crisis in prices it is necessary:(a) To Sustain the present producing organisation.(b) To stimulate further production.(c) To provide for the reorganisation of productionin the countries of Eastern Europe and in the defeated countries,.The necessity of not allowing the actual productive organisation to languish is evident.   Pending the contribution of the disorganised European countries, the extension of the exchange market would have, as a primary effect, a further , irritation of the crisis^In order to maintain the actual producing organisation, it Is necessary to secure raw material and means of transport to those countries that may be deprived of them,   Such supplies must be secured on equitable conditions in order to permit of a suitable production for exchange.Just complaints are provoked by the extra price of coal for export, which renders it impossible for the coal-importing countries, especially Italy, to establish the fundamental Industrie! productions on a sound economic basis.Useful understandings could be arrived at between the industrial organisations of the various countries regarding a division of the production.All
All immediate efforts must, however, be directed to:a) The increase of agricultural productionhaving particular regard to cereals.b) The increase of coal production, o) The better utilisation of tonnage,,For the purchase and distribution of wheat and coal the action of Interallied Committees is certainly useful.In every country the most drastic measures should be adopted for restricting the consumption.   Tho various. Government must stimulate and facilitate the export of anything not strictly necessary for home requirements.International exchange of goods with neutral countries and with the Allies must be supported by agreements between both banking and industrial organisations, with the objeot of giving new life to the pre-war credit position.Witii the countries of  astern iiurope and with the defeatedcountries the import and export trade should be conductedprincipally by means of barter.,In order to overcome the orisis of the passage from the eoonom^c situation of Yjar to that of Peaoe and the reconstruction of Europe, oredits for a few years should be assured to thosp countries who need them.   The financing of raw materials and of means of transport is particularly necessary.   Credits must have,as a counterpart, exports; and must be secured for at least ^our or five years.It would be desirable that such oredit transactions should,be arranged between private organisations, with the sanction and support of the Governments,   Syndicates between banking andIndustrial organisations would be tho most suitable means to this end.   In this way production would gradually follow the lines of private enterprises. Governtnents of the debtor countries might give, whenever the organisation granting the credit should request it, complementary and collateral guarantees.This system of credit would tend also to cover, by way of compensation, transactions relating to exchanges between debtor and creditor countries, thus eliminating a considerable part of the movement of currency.
To the amelioration of the crisis of the rate o:.;&apos; exchange, there should certainly be devoted a strict financial policy directed towards the gradual reduction of paper currency and to the adjustment of the budget, balancing the expenditure with the receipts derived from taxes.   The crisis, however, will &quot;not be overcome except by the politioal and moral settlement of Europe.     Only then will the efforts to re-establish, in single countries, the balance between production and consumption be crowned by success.Therefore, the Conference :Reaffirms the solidarity of the Allies, for the purpose or overcoming the crisis caused by the transformation and reconstruction of the producing activity of Europe.It recognises the desirability of inviting the Council to indicate, at the earliest possible moment, the means best adapted r&quot;or the resumption of the producing activity of the defeated countries.Recognises tho necessity of facilitating the supply of raw materials to those countries in need of them.Recognises the desirability of supporting those credit operations defined amongst tho banking and industrial groups of the various countries, which may be directed towards the financing of enterprises essential for the resumption of producing activity and which can be covered by exports:   facilitating compensations of exchanges between the various countries.
Affirms the desirability-of &quot;maintaining&quot; the-Inter-sllied Committee for the purchase of cereals.Recognises the advisability of the Supreme Economic Council re-examining as early as possible the problem of the distribution of coal.Recognises the necessity of the Government action in the different countries being directed towards using to the best advantage all efforts for intensifying production and for restricting those articles of consumption not strictly necessary. s
