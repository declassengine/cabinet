SECRET.fThis Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty*3 C ww-^. l*J169MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.^^Bl^^&apos; Report for Month ending 15th February 1920.Memoranda have been presented to the Cabinet Committee on the De-control of Food respecting: (1) Government purchases of Bacon, Butter, and Cheese.(2) Reconstruction of Food Ministry; and(3) Statutory Controls of minor foodstuffs.Imports of the principal foodstuffs in January showed a general improvement on those of the closing months of last year. As a result of large arrivals the decrease in cereal stocks was less than the normal seasonal movement, though, of course, the general level is below that of war years when larger reserves were necessary. With imports of meat of over 60,000 tons, stocks in store continued to rise above any quantity previously recorded, and a second month of large bacon arrivals brought the quantity of this commodity in store back approximately to the level of a year ago. An improvement in the imports of butter has checked the downward movement of stocks, but there was an appreciable decrease in stocks of cheese, and a smaller one in those of sugar. The apparent decrease in the stocks of oilseeds and oilcake and meal in store is not inconsistent with the maintenance of the total stocks of the country, which as a result of transport and other difficulties are at present difficult to trace, and in any case are ample.The consumption of flour as illustrated by deliveries of flour from mills and releases from imported stocks remains for the winter months at a rate differing little from that of a year ago. It might have been expected that this rate, which is considerably above the pre-war rate, would be more affected by increased supplies of other foodstuffs, e.g., of meat, where the estimated civilian consumption in Great Britain has increased from 23,700 tons to 27,900 tons per week as compared with a year ago, but the high cost of living, and in particular the higher prices and shorter supplies of potatoes, tend to maintain the demand for bread.The movement in prices cannot be regarded as satisfactory, and there can be little doubt that in general food prices in the Spring will compare unfavourably with those of the last Spring (1919). This, however, is a tendency not confined to the case of food, and it may be said that the upward tendency is more marked in clothing than in food, in the latter case the adverse exchange being the dominant factor.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on February 1st show a slight decrease in the average retail food prices, the percentage increase on July, 1914, falling from 135&apos; 9 on January 1st to 134 * 9 on February 1st. The principal decreases, if a comparison be made with the prices ruling on January 1st, were in imported beef; the fall in the prices of milk and eggs amounted to 3&apos; 4 per cent, and 2&apos; 9 per cent, respectively. The important increases in prices were in potatoes, butter, both fresh and salt and cheese.The total expenditure for the month exceeds that of February, 1919, by Is. 4jd. imported meat and eggs are cheaper but prices have advanced in bread,&apos;tea, sugar, milk, potatoes, margarine and butter.Regarding wholesale prices in January, barley rose from 105s. lOd. to 110s. 6d. per 400 lbs. at the middle of the month, but finished at the end of the month at 106s. 2d. Oats rose from. 57s. 2d. to 58s. Id. per 312 lbs. Canadian bacon remained at 192s. per cwt., and Canadian cheese rose from 150s. lid to 163s. 4cL per cwt.; English Cheddar cheese was unaltered at 163s. 4d. per cwt. There was no movement in sugar, English refined remained at 72s. per cwt. and granulated at 66s. per cwt. Indian tea fell, from Is. l\d. to Is. 3^d. per lb. and Ceylon from Is. 5d. to Is. id. per lb. Oilseeds continued to rise in price.a (33)10115 Pic 17 146 2/20 EAS
