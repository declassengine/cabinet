^This Document Is the Property of &apos;0.P.   724     )oj is Britannic Majesty^ Govern -lent) &apos; 85PARAPHRASE TKLEGRAM from the Governor General of theGoramcnwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for theJ-     Colonies.,(Received Colonial Office  9.30 p.rru 21 at February 1920)Following from Prime Minister begins.   Secret.   League Hffi    0^ Nations.  Your telegram of January 22nd I quite agreethat it is most desirable that on questions of great moment all parts of the Empiro should present a united front *   Also I think that the suggestion that these should be discussed previously is ^ood in itself but the appointment for the purpose of discussion of a representative in London raises most important question.    Whether the mafshinery is compatible with those rights of self-government which the Dominions possess and that status under the League of Nations which is accorded to them by the Treaty seems doubtful.    Without prejudice to any such proposal I think however4 that it is very desirable that the various parts of the Empire should keep in intimate touch with one another and that each part should be infommed of what the others are doing or intend to do, and I think that pro&apos;tern, a branch of the British Cabinet Secretariat would be the most convenient means of ensuring that each part of the Empire may before its own views are communicated finally to Secretariat General be informed&apos;of the policy of other part.     I am of the opinion that the other suggestions in your telegram should stand over for consideration at the meeting of the Imperial Cabinet next year.   Ends.FERGUSON.
