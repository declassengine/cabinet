WORTHIN GTON EVANS, 21st February, 1920.THE INTWRALLIED CONFERENCE ON THE CARS OF DISABLED mil., In December 1916, the-Belgian Government invited the British Government to send delegates to an Inter-Allied Conference On the after-care of disabled men which they had arranged in.consultation with the French Government.   As a&quot;result, representatives of the Ministry and the Service Departments&quot; attended the first meeting of this Conference at Paris in Hay 1917. The programme included the reading of papers, visits to hospitals arid training centres, and an exhibition of artificial limbs and appliances.   Conferences afterwards took place in London (Kay,1918) and Rome (October, 1019),.A Permanent Inter-Allied Committee was established in July 1917, at a second session of the first Conference,, with headquarters in Paris, a permanent- establishment for the publication of a revievj, and a library and museum. &quot; The first meeting of the Committee took place in Paris in&apos; July 1917, and subsequent meetings in London (October, 1917) Peris (December, 1917), Paris (July, 1918), Lisbon (July 1919) and Rome, (October 1919).   The Ministry was represented at these meetings of the Committee and at, the Conferences.In October 1917, the Committee decided that the delegates should approach their Governments for contributions towards expenses and the Treasury agreed&quot; to a grant of 30,000 francs, (then  1100) for the year July 1917-18, an amount equal to the French-contribution;   A further 30,000 francs was sanctioned for the year 1918-19. In addition the expenses of delegates and for the transit and arrangement of exhibits have been paid.The Ministry representatives purposed to raise the question of the permanence of the Committee at the Lisbon meeting in July 1919, but this was forestalled by a proposal that the Committee should be affiliated to tho League of Nations under Article 24 of the Peace treaty (copy attached). Application had already been made for the purpose but no reply had been received.   The British delegates promised to report the proposal to their Government but could not do more in view of departmental changes consequent on the creation of the Ministry of Health.   At Rome in October 1919,&apos; the Ministry&quot; representative suggested at a meeting of the Committee that its objects would bo more economically secured by informal visits, correspondence, and the interchange of memoranda; this was not sup-ported by the delegates from other countries.At the Lisbon meeting of the Committee in July 1919, a resolution was unanimously adopted that the allied Governments should invite representatives of disabled men to form part of their&quot;delegation A resolution was passed at tho plenary Conference at Rome re-affirming the principle and inviting the heads of national delegations to make practical arrangements to that end.   The matter wa3 also discussed by the Committee and it was&apos;decided to increase the maximum number of a delegation from 12 to 18..The
The conclusion to which I have come is that it would be inadvisable to withdraw the British&quot;Delegation, and that the officers&apos; Association, the Comrades of the Great War and the Federation of Discharged end Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and the Association should be invited to nominate one representative each as part of. the Delegation. Whether the number eventually decided upon as the&apos; maximum of a delegation he twelve or eighteen, I will take particular care to see that ^official&quot; representation safeguards the interests of the Ministry.L.
