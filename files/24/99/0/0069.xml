211(This Documentooertv cHis BritarHi!Majesty&apos;9 Govern roe^t.)^f^lg^tey Secret.rom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,Wth February 1920.(Received 28th.)2603. 26th February. In continuation of his wire forwarded to you under our , 17th February, Malleson wires 24th February, repeated Teheran : &apos;&quot; 1. In para. 5 of above telegram I related report from Chardjui to effect that, whilst there was no question at present of any Bolshevik Russian troops being sent to aid Afghanistan against India, nevertheless there is reason to believe that Mahometan force was being organised, armed and trained by Bolsheviks in Turkestan, with a view to its being later on placed at disposal of Amir Amanulla.&quot; 2. I have now received from two quite independent and far apart sources stories of Bolshevik intentions on similar lines with regard to Persia. Strong force of Persian Bolsheviks now in Bolshevik ranks is to be augmented to total strength of 15,000 to 20,000 men, and placed under command of Turkish General Khalil from the date (corrupt group). When fully equipped and trained this force was to be let loose against Khorasan in such fashion as not unduly to compromise Bolshevik Government. This^ would appear to indicate they would operate from Yamut country south of Atrak river, so that Bolsheviks could wash their hands of all responsibility.   .&quot; 3. Matter will be carefully watched, but for the present information should be treated with reserve. These Bolsheviks&apos; schemes, however, offer them a way out of the dilemma, first, their loudly proclaimed desire to free the East and make trouble every-where for England ; second, their equal intense anxiety to take no overt step against us so long as there is any chance of recognition by British Government. The middle course contemplated might seem to them to fulfil both sides of above aspirations.&quot;
