DAVIS.The Rt.Hon.Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G., etc , etc., ate ,The Foreign Office, S.W.1,
The j -eJjnrtTTaemoxajid^^ of the PrimeMinisters of France and Great Britain has vreo^eiJ7^^rMalir^^aa^e^fMl and earnest consideration of the President.   He has no desire whatrev^t.. to criticise the attitude of the Governments of France and Great-Britain concerning the Adriatic settlement but feels that in the present ciroumstances he has no choice but to maintain the position he has all along taken as regards that settlement.   He believes it to be the central principle fought for in the War that no Govern-ment or group of Governments has the right to dispose of the territory or to determine the politioal allegiance of any free people.   The five Great Powers,- though the Government of the &quot;United States constitutes onev of them, have in his conviction no more right than had the Austrian Government to dispose of the free Jugo-Slavic peoples, without the free consent and co-operation of those peoples.   The Presidents position is that the Powers associated against Germany gave final and irrefutable proof of their sincerity in the war by writing into the Treaty of Versailles, Article 1C of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which constitutes an assurance tnat all the Great Powers have done what they have compelled Germany to do - have forgone all territorial aggression and all interference with the free politioal self-determination of the peoples of the-world,   With this principle lived up to. permanent peace is seoured and the supreme object of the recent oonflict has been achieved, justice and self-determination have been substituted for aggression and political diotation.    Without it there isno security for any nation that conscientiously adheres to a non-militaristic policy. The object of the war, as to the Government of the United States, understandc it, was to free Europe from that cloud of anxiety which had hungoea? it for generations by the constant threat of the use of military force by one of the most powerfulGovernments
Governments of the Continerrt, ^^and^the-lhre^derrtJTe-els it is important to say again that, in the opinion of the^American Government, the terms of&apos;the Peace Settlement must continue^ to he formulated upon the basis of the principles for which America entered the war.   It is in a spirit of co-operation, therefore, and of desire for mutual understanding that the President reviews the various considerations which the French and British Prime Ministers have emphasised in their memorandum of&apos; February 17th*   He   is confident that they will not mistake his motives in undertaking to make plain what he feels to be the necessary conclusions from their statements.The President notes that the objeotion3   of the Italians and the Jugo-Slavs were made the basis for discarding the project eot of the free state of Piume* It would seem to follow, therefore, that the joint consent of these two Powers should have been required for the substitute project.   The consent of Italy has been obtained. He does net find however, that the Jugo-Slavs have also expressed a willingness to accept the substitute plan.,   Are they to be required now to aooept a proposal whioh is more unsatisfactory, because they have raised objections to the solution proposed by the British, Trench and Amerioan Governments in the memorandum cf Beoember 9th?     The President would of course make no &quot;objection to a settlement mutually agreeable to Italy and Jugo-Slavia&apos; regarding their oommon frontier in the Piume region, provided that such an agreement is not made on the basi3 of compensation elsewhere at the expense of nationals of a third Power.    His willingness to aooept such proposed joint agreement of Italy and Jugc-Slavia is based on the faot that only their own nationals are involved.     In consequence, theresults
results of direct negotiation   cf the two interested Powers would fall within the scope of the prlnodple^of---selfwletermizia-&apos; tion.   Failing   in this, both parties should be willing to accept a decision by the Goveoriments of Great Britain, France and the United States.The British and Frenoh Governments appear to find in the President&apos;8 suggestion that the latest proposals would pave the way for the annexation of the city cf Flume, an implication that the guarantee cf the League cf Nations is worthless and that the Italian Government does not intend to abide by a Treaty into which it has entered.     The President cannot but regard this implication as without basis and as contrary to his thought. . la his view, the proposal oonneot Flume with Italy by a narrow strip of ocast territory is quite impracticable,    As he has already said, it involves extraordinary complexities in customs control, oioast guard services and other related matters and he is unable tc detach himself from the previous view of the British and Frenoh Governments as expressed jointly with the American Government in the ii4m*j&amp;.ftteXra of December 9th that &apos;the plan appears to run counter to every consideration of geography, .eoonomios and ter* *-torial oonrenienoe*. He further believes that to have Italian territory join Fiume would be to invite strife out of which annexa-ticn might issue.   Therefore in undertaking to shape the solution so as tc prevent this he is acting on the principle that each part of the final settlement should be based upon the essential justioe of that particular case.   This was sne of the principles adopted by the Allied and Aesooiafed Powers as a basis for treaty making. To it has been added the provisions of the League of Nations bv.t jift has never been the&apos; policy of either this Government or its associated to invoke the League of Nations as a&apos;guarantee that a bad settlement shall not become worse.   The sum of such actions would of necessity destroy faith in the League and eventually the
the League itself.     The President n-ates -wirth ,^i4^f^cixdjon^ that the Gar-enments of Great Britain and France will not lose sight of the future interests and well being of the Albanian peoples.     The American Government quite understands that the three-fold division of Albania in the British--S?cvenoh agreement might be most acceptably to the Jugo-Slav Government, but it is just as vigorously oppesei to injuring the Albanian people for the benefit of &apos;Jugo-Slavia as itnis opposed to injuring the Jugo-Slav people for the benefit of Italy.     It believes that the differences between the Christian and Mohammedan populations will be increased by putting the two ^elections under the control of nations of unlike language, government and economic strength.    Moreover, one part would be administered by the Italian Government which is represented on the Council of the League;     the other part by the Jugo-Slav Government which has no such representation.     Therefore,      alter or withdraw the mandate at some future time would be well ni^gh impossible.&apos;   Regarding the Treaty of London, the French and British Prime Ministers will appreciate that the American Government must hesitate to speak with assurance since it ia a matter in tfthich the French and British Governments can alone judge their obligations and determine their policies.     Btyt K the President feels that it is not improper to recall a f$w of tbjfe arguments which have already been advanced against ;thia treaty, namely, the dissolution of Auet*i9-Hungary, the secre-^. c^racter of the treaty and its opposition to the principles ^riiinimously accepted as the basis for making peace,    In addition, he desires to submit certain further considerations. In the Northern Italian frontiers agreements hare already been reaon^d which depart from the Treaty of London line and tfijaj^h were made wilih the understanding that negotiations were pro-c-eedinjg on quite a new basis.     It has beenrtao secret thatthe
the &quot;p^ari;i^&apos;^t^th^tr^a1^Niid-not themselves now desire it and that they hare thus far ref rained-from putting its pro-visions into effect. ;   In mutually disregarding-their secret treaty commitments the parties to the treaty hav^re^gnxsed the change in circumstances that has taken place,  in the interval between the signing of the seosret treaty and its proposed execution at the present time,     Por nearly eight months discussion of the Adriatic problem has pr oceeded-on..;bhe assumption that a better basis for an understanding could lie found than that provided by the Treaty of London,     The greater part of the new proposals have already received Italy&apos;s assent. These proposals in some cases affected territory beyond -the Treaty of London line, as in the Tarvis and sexten valleys;   in others, the territory fell short of the Treaty of London line, as in the case of the islands of Lusain, Unie, Lisas and Pelagosa, to mention only a few of the many proposals upon which tentative agreements have long been reached and which would be upset by an application of the. Treaty at thia late day.*The coupling of the Treaty of London as an obligatory alternative to the Adriatic settlement proposed on January 14th, came/as a surprise to the American Government because this Government had already by the agreement of December 9th, entered into sj distinct understanding with the British and French Governments regarding the basis of a settlement on the question. By thejir action of January 14th the Government of the United Stated,was confronted with a definite solution to ythich was adden tin January 20th a threat to fall hack upon the terms of the Treaty of London.     This course was followed without any attempt to $eek the views of this Government or to provide such opportunity of discussion as was easily arranged.in many other mia/tterje dealt with in the same period.The .
The-^esiAwrt ^rt-^^^^t^\ theJl^current^i^^^ of $4bv\Mr. 17 tb refers to the difficulty of reconcdlijag^e-thiiogr^ considerations in making territorial adjustments and cites the inclusion of 3,000,000 Germans in Czecho-Slovakia and more than 3,000,000 Euthenes&apos;&apos; in Poland as examples of necessary modifi-cstions of ethnographic frontiers.     He feels compelled to observe that,this is, a line of reasoning which the Italian representatives have advanced during the course of negotiations but which the British and French have hitherto found themselves unable to accept,     There were&apos; cases where, for sufficient . geographical and economic reasons, slight deflections of the ethnographical frontier were sanctioned by the conference, and 1she American Government believes that, if ltaiy^ould...ocaiRen.^ to apply the some principles1 in Istria and Dalmatis, the Adriatic question would not exist.line American Government heartily subscribes to the sentiments expressed by the Governments of Great Britain and &quot;Prancq regarding Italy&apos;s participation in the war.     It fully appreciates the vital consequence of her participation and is\ profoundly grateful for her heroic sacrifices,     These sentiments-have Ween repeatedly expressed&apos;by the American Government. . -But such don si derations cannot be made the reason for unjust setile-ments [which will be provocative of future wars,     A course thus, detenriined would be short-sighted and not in accord wiJ.:h the terribjle sacrifices of the entire world which caft/ne justified and erlnobled only by leading finally to settlements in keeping with tfhe principles for which the war was fought,     The President asks tfhat the Prime Ministers of Prance, Great Britain ani Italy will zfead his determination in the Adriatic matter in -She light o.1 the s e [principles and. s e t tl em en ts and&quot; will realise tha t a t a a ding upon   such a foundation of principle he must of necessity mairtai-the position which he arrived at after months of earnest consideration.     He confidently counts upon their cooperation in thils effort on his part to maintain for the Allied and Associated Powers that direction of affairs which was initiated by th/a victory over Germany and the Peace Conference at Paris,
