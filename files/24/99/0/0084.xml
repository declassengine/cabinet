S -7: C RET. . Oopy No.^CABINET,CP, 784, ,SITUATION IK VIENNA,(Note by the Chancellor of the Fxcheguer, covering a letter from Colonel Lambert Ward, M.P.I recently asked Colonel Lambert Ward, M.P,, to incorporate in e letter to me an account of the impressions which he had formed in regard to the state of affairs in Vienna and which he haa put before me in conversation* Colonel We^rd has now complied with my request and I circulate his letter herewith for the information of the Cabinet.(Intlld.) A.C.3rd March, 1920.HOUSE OP COMMONS,2nd March, 1920.    &amp;- ?Dear Mr.Chamberlain,You asked me to let .you have a short account of my opinion of the conditions prevailing in Vienna at the present moment *I will endeavour to be as brief as possible as I know you probably have a great many similar documents to read.I arrived at Vienna on the 22nd of last month, and left on the 28th.   During that time I stayed at a small hotel in the poorer portion of the city and spent practically the whole time going round amongst the people to find out what the conditions really were as apart from the statistics and I       figures supplied to us by the authorities.   I must say theimpression I formed was that conditions at the&apos; present moment were not mearly as bad there&apos;-&apos;as people are endeavouring to make   out.   There is an absolute orgy of gaiety and extrava-gance going on amongst the richer people.   Theatres, restaur-ants, and music-halls are packed day after day - night afterTTHIS DOCUMTOT IS THF PROPKRTV Q? HIT BBITATOIC M.\JT!3TY&apos;S qQVTfllffllOT),
254night.   Every hotel is full, many of them have no rooms to let more than 3 weeks ahead.   It is possible to buy practically anything, only the price is, of course, in Austrian currency appalling.     There is apparently no coal to bring the necessa-ries of life to the city, but there is any amount to run elec-tric light and electric cars day and night.   To give you one example only - on Shrove Tuesday a Ball was given at the Concert House, which You probably know, is as large as the Albert Hall.   Certainly 10,000 people were there, each of whom had paid the pre-war equivalent of  4 per ticket.   The only drink being served was champagne, the price of which, in pre-war currency was  20 to  30 per bottle, and the people were still going home at 7 0&apos;clock the following morning.There is no doubt a large amount of real suffering amongst the middle and professional classes whose incomes have not &apos; been raised in proportion to the Increased cost of living,The working-classes&apos; wages have been raised 30 or 40 times pre-war rates, with the result that they are much as- they &apos; were before.I must say I looked for signs of misery and suffering in the crowded streets and did not find them.   The people were well-dressed and looked well-fed, and were certainly not in the pitiable condition of the French and Belgian refugees in the early days of the v/ar.   The death rate is low; infant mortality is high: but I can name several towns in England to-day where it is higher. Children between the ages of 1 and 5 no doubt suffer from the lack of milk, and will doubtless feel the effects for the rest of their lives.Personally, I can see no reason for the heart-breaking accounts of the sufferings of Vienna which have appeared in the papers, and I cannot account for them.   I am inclined to suspect some subsidised scheme of newspaper propaganda designed to dis-credit the Treaty of Peace and to soften the hearts and loosen the purse strings of the Allies,There in no doubt, however, that the future- is very
blackc   The. continued exisilence- of Vienna is, in my-opinion., impossible, that is, in the state in whioh. li^existed in pre-war days.   Vienna lived, as I daresay you know, almost entirely on providing amusement&apos; and luxury for the whole of Austro-Hungaryo Practically all her industries were what might be called &quot;luxury&quot; industries, and entirely dependent on there being sufficient wealthy people in the country to buy the products.To-day not only has Bohemia, Hungary, galicia- and Jugo-Slavia been severed from the Austrian Empire, but the inhabitants of those countries are extremely poor, and are likely to have very little money to spend for the next 5 years or more to put the natter briefly - Vienna no longer has any raison d&apos;etre in the life of Central Europe.   Its future existence in its present form and with a population of 2-1 millions is, in piy opinion, quite impossible,,It is very difficult to help people like the Viennese as at present they are making practically no effort to help them^ selves.   In fact, Vienna is spending its sitstanoe on riotous living, and, at the same time, appealing to the Allies for the necessaries of life.   The inhabitants seem to think they have merely fallen on a cycle of bad times, which will eventually pass away without any special exertion on their part, and aro not making the slightest effort to Improve matters.   All the same,   , there is no doubt, that unless we feed Vienna, Vienna will starve but the position will be the same in 12 months time as it is now.   If we are prepared to accept Vienna, and, to a lesser extent, Austria and Poland, as our permanent pensioners, well and good.   But if not, we must remember that they are at present doing very little to help themselves, and the situation will not improve by time.Banks and offices are crowded, but the only business being done is speculating in the kroner, and all European currencies. They are clamouring for credit, for coal and for raw material * It seems to me that if we grant then long credits the only immediate effect will be an improvement in the value of the
kroner, which will lead to further speculation.   If we provide thera with raw material we have no guarantee that there will be any market for the goods which they manufacture.   Per-sonally I am convinced that there will be no market for Viennese goods in Central Europe for at least two years.In conclusion, I can only say that, although the present con-&apos; ,dition is not so bad, the future is hopeless, the more so because no one there seems to be doing a hand&apos;s turn towards improving matters, or towards producing the.food which they so urgently need.Yours truly, *       (sd) A. LAffBERT WARD *
