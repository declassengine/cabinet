mkm J *I   afill     j[ - &quot;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY T&quot;S GOVERNMENTy,-   Beer Gravities and DrunkennessMemorandum by the Minister of Health.I regret having to inflict a memorandum on my Colleagues on this subject,but I am less impressed by the alleged &quot;hardships&quot; and &quot;grievances&quot; of some of the wealthier brewers than I am by the fact that drunkenness among men is already, according to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, four times as great as a year ago, while I know that convictions among women were at the end of 1919 more than double what they wore the previous year.     This will mean a higher incidence of disease among women, a higher infant mortality from overlaying, lack of care, etc-, and an increase in the other anti-social consequences of excessive drinking.I would call the CabinetJs attention to the Report published in 1918 by a distinguished Committee on which my Chiof Medical Officer, Sir George Newman, served.    There it is clearly stated that the stronger an alcoholic beverage is the more injuriously does it affect the body of the individual and the more drunkenness does it tend to produce. -I am quite aware that beer - even of the heavier sorts is not as potent in evil effect as spirits.    But I have observed that every increase by the Cabinet, whether in quantity or strength or form of alcohol is merely used as a pretext for a subsequent further extension.     Spirits had to be increased because the supplies   of boer were augmented. The gravity of beer in England had to be raised because it was  higher in Ireland.    We were told the average gravity of/
of beer had to &quot;be raised because the working classes -were dissatisfied. , Vie now find that the brewers are not brewing up to the -maximum permitted strength.     If we increase the -gravity of beer again to relieve certain inconveniences experienced by the big brewers of the heaviest proprietary beers we shall doubtless later be asked to relax the dilution of spirits which prejudice distillers of proprietary brands of spirits.     The more alcohol there is in a beverage the greater the stimulus on craving and desire for increased consumption and the more prejudicial tho effect on the tissues of the body and the community generally.Ministry of Health.- C ADDIS ON.24. 2. 20.
