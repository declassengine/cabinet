De Sausmarez, C.M.G., D.S.O., who was the first representative of the War Office, was succeeded by Brigadier-General N. W. Webber, C.M.G., D.S.O., and Mr. T. W. Phillips, C.B.E., the first representative of the Ministry of Labour, by Mr. H. Wolfe, C.B.E.,    APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE.On the 6th of December, 1918, the Committee of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office voluntarily tendered their resignation to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Right Honourable Walter Long, M.P. In their last official utterances the Committee welcomed the decision of the Government to exercise closer supervision over emigration on the lines recommended by the Dominions Royal Commission and embodied in the Hill which was introduced into Parliament in the Session of 1918. They emphasised their opinion that the old system had proved defective and needed reform, and they explained that they resigned because it was beyond the power of a voluntary Committee, such as theirs, to deal with the urgent problems connected with emigration which would arise with the return of peace.Their resignation was accepted and the Oversea Settlement Committee, at first known as the Government Emigration Committee, was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies &quot; in view of the need for creating machinery to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to deal effectively with the problems which are likely to arise during the period of reconstruction after the war.&quot;The Committee&apos;s title was changed to that of Oversea Settlement Committee with a view to bringing out the distinction between settlement overseas within the Empire, with which the Committee arc principally concerned, and emigration to foreign countries,
218THE COMMITTEE AND THETR STAFF.The Staff of the Committee, who form a sub-department of the Colonial Office, were at first housed on the Horse Guards&apos; Parade, but were transferred in April to their present offices at 59, Victoria Street, S.W. 1. The continuity of the work of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office was secured by the inclusion of the staff of that office in the staff of the Committee, and by the appoint-ment of Viscount Biirnham, who was for many years a member of the Committee of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office, to be a member of the new Committee. Further, the Vice-Chairman is a Principal Clerk of the Colonial Office who formerly acted as Chairman of the Committee of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office in addition to performing his ordinary duties at the Colonial Office. On his appointment as Vice Chairman of the new Committee he was seconded from the Colonial Office, and now devotes the whole of his time to the work of the Committee. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is cv-officio Chairman of the Committee, usually presides at their meetings, devotes a considerable part of his time to work connected with oversea settlement, and apprises their President, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, of their views and recommendations.PART I.RELATIONS WITH THE SELF-GOVERNING DOMINIONS AND THEIRREPRESENTATIVES.1.-ADVISORY COMMITTEES.The Committee have maintained the close touch with the representatives of the Self-Governing Dominions, which is essential ,to their work, by means of a series of conferences at the Colonial Office between the Chairman of the Committee, representing the President, and the High Com-missioners for Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and Newfoundland, the Agents-General for the Canadian Provinces and the Australian State?, and the British South Africa Company. Lord Milner presided personally at one of the initial meetings, and in his introductory remarks emphasised the view that the problem of oversea settle-, ment should be regarded from the standpoint of the unity of the Empire, and was not a matter in which there was any conflict of interests between the Dominions and the mother country. The Vice-Chairman and members of the Staff of the Committee were present at all these meetings, and other members of the Committee attended when their presence was required. Ten such meetings have taken place during the year, the first being held on the 5th of March.Close touch has also been maintained throughout the year with the various interests in this country which are concerned with oversea settlement and emigration.It will be seen from Section 8 that an Advisory Committee on the oversea settlement of women has already been established. It is proposed shortly to set up a General Advisory Com-mittee to advise upon all matters relating to oversea settlement.2.-EFFECTS OF THE WAR.The war has materially affected the problems of oversea settlement and emigration, and has in certain respects increased their difficulties.Provisional figures furnished by the War Office showed that 500,000 males between the ages of 20 and 49 were killed or died of wounds or sickness during the war, the loss falling most heavily upon men between the ages of 20 and 29.Provisional figures furnished by the Registrar-General showed that on the 31st December, 1918, the population of the United Kingdom, which, at the census of 1911, contained an excess of females over males, between the ages of 15 and 45, of 566,000, contained an excess of females between those ages of 1,266,000.There can be no doubt, though the Committee are not in possession of statistics, that the War has also had the effect of reducing the surplus male population of the self-governing Dominions, which in 1911 (see paragraph 477 of the Report of the Dominions Royal Commission [Cd. 8462]) was considerable.It is, however, reasonably certain that a surplus still exists, and it therefore appears highly desirable simultaneously to diminish the surplus of women in the United Kingdom and the surplus of men in the oversea Dominions by encouraging the settlement overseas of women from the United Kingdom, if and in so far as they will be welcome overseas and can find employment under suitable conditions.   This question is further dealt with in Section 6 of the Report.The movement of British subjects from this country to the Dominions with a view to settlement has been virtually suspended for over five years, and has not yet been fully resumed. Throughout this period very few new settlers have arrived in Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, whilst the new settlers who have entered Canada in considerable numbers have entered from the United States, and, though a valuable source of strength to the Dominion, are presumably in few cases persons of British birth. It would seem, therefore, that at the present moment the need for new settlers; British by birth and British in sympathies, must be great throughout the Dominions,(27038-2) Wt, 84594-1161 20tia  2/20 II. Rt  0,1
A further result of the war has been greatly to increase the cost of ocean travel, with the result that at the present time passages to the various self-governing Dominions cost approximately double the pre-war rates, and the present tendency appears to be towards further increases. The present minimum cost of a third class passage to Canada is  14 10s., to Australia  3(5, to New Zealand  30, to South Africa  19 10a1., and to Newfoundland  17 approximately.3.-SHIPPING SITUATION.The year was mainly occupied with preparations for the future. Shipping was not available for the carriage of any considerable number of settlers, nor, generally speaking, were the Dominion Governments prepared to receive settlers, until they had resettled their own population. It was only in the last few weeks of the year that any organised parties of British subjects, hitherto domiciled in the United Kingdom, were able to proceed overseas with a view to settlement.4-EXTENT OF OVERSEA SETTLEMENT AND EMIGRATION.During the ten years 1904-1914, the number of British subjects who left this country with a view to permanent settlement in other parts of the world averaged about 250,000 a year. In one exceptional year, 1912, the number was about 400,000. It is impossible to foretell whether the future movements of settlers and emigrants will he upon a larger or a smaller scale than it was in the years which preceded the war.5.-PROSPECTS OVERSEAS.Abundant evidence was received in confirmation of the already established fact that the only classes of settlers whom the Dominions at present require in large numbers are, in the case of males, those who intend to settle upon the land, and, in the case of females, domestic servants. For both these classes the demand is practically unlimited. For other classes, and especially for industrial workers, whether male or female, the demand is limited, and at present confined to a few special industries. Section 15 explains the arrangements which it is hoped to make with a view to notifying the authorities in this country of any openings of this kind which are available overseas, and to bringing such openings to the notice of the industrial population in the United Kingdom.6.-MEMORANDUM AS TO POLICY&quot;.Shortly after their appointment the Committee were instructed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to express their views as to the attitude which should be adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards &quot; emigration&quot; from the United Kingdom with special reference to the emigration of ex-service men, women, children, &amp;c.On the 10th of February the Committee submitted to the Colonial Office a memorandum embodying their views. In a covering letter they urged the need for legislation to enable a Central Emigration Authority to give effective direction and supervision to oversea settlement and to emigration to foreign countries. They expressed their desire to enter forthwith into, preliminary consultation with the representatives in London of the self-governing Dominions (as they have done by means of the conferences already referred to) and they urged that &quot;in order to arrive at an authoritative agreement on a common Imperial policy with regard to the immensely important problem of the best distribution of the population of the British Empire, alike from the point of view of the happiness of its citizens and of the strength and development of the whole, it would be very, advantageous if His Majesty&apos;s Government could fully discuss these matters at a special conference with the Dominion&apos; Prime Ministers before they return to their own Dominions, or with such other representatives as the Prime Ministers may decide to depute for the purpose.&quot;Unfortunately, the pressure of work connected with the Peace Conference prevented the discussion of these problems with the Dominion Ministers before they left this country.The general attitude of the Committee towards the problem of oversea settlement was outlined in the following passage : The development of the population and wealth of the whole British Empire is the key to the problem of post-war reconstruction. The heavy burden of war debt upon every part of the Empire make3 this develop-ment an immediate and urgent necessity. The growth of population in the Dominions, in so far as it adds directly to their strength and prosperity, and consequently to the strength and prosperity of the&apos; whole, and in so far as it increases the number of our own best customers and purveyors of essential foodstuffs and raw materials, is so obviously desirable that it is assumed throughout in this memorandum that emigration should, as far as possible, be directed to countries within the confines of the British Empire. On the other hand, it is equally necessary to keep in mind throughout that the main burden of the indebtedness for the recent war, and of the provision of Imperial defence in the near future, still rests upon this country, and that it is essential that its man-power and taxable capacity should not be weakened in the process of Imperial development.The question of migration from the United Kingdom to other parts of the Empire is therefore essen-tially a question of due adjustment. Such migration will be beneficial or injurious according to the extent to which it takes place and the conditions under which it is carried out.Within certain limits withdrawal of population from the United Kingdom tends to reduce the compe-tition for employment, increase wage&apos;, and raise the standard of living ; and to such an extent as it does this it also tends to increase the birthrate, and so eventually to make good the loss caused by emigration. In so far as those who leave the United Kingdom for settlement in other parts of the Empire achieve success and multiply in their new homes, they tend still further to improve the conditions of employment in the Mother Country and to encourage the growth of its population by providing a growing market for its goods and a continuous supply of necessary foodstuffs and raw materials. In other words a moderate flow of emigration rightly directed tends not only to improve the immediate economic and social conditions in this
country, but actually, in the long run, to increase both its total population and man-power. The population and man-power of these islands are obviously greater to-day than they could ever have become it&apos; British emigration had not develuped the resources and built up the markets of the British Dominions.On the other hand, an excessive stream of emigration from the United Kingdom at any particular time, cither of the population as a whole, or of a particular class or sex, may seriously weaken the whole social and economic fabric ; while conversely, an excessive stream of immigration into the Dominions may temporarily create serious economic and social difficulties overseas, and encourage a state of public feeling unfavourable to the movement.  kBroadly speaking, migration during the last generation has, no doubt, benefited both the United Kingdom and the Empire as a whole. But it has not been .without certain unsatisfactory features. Thus the emigra-tion of men has heavily exceeded that of women. Between 1871 and 1911 the male emigrants from England and Wales exceeded the female by 590,000. There has also been an excessive depletion of the agricultural population in some parts of the United Kingdom, especially in Scotland. On the other hand, there has at times been an excessive flow to the Dominions of a type of population which they could not easily absorb. Thus emigration between the years 1910 and 1913 was exceptionally large. Towards the end of that period conditions in Canada became unsatisfactory, and there was considerable unemployment and distress.The ideal is a constant flow of emigration neither in excess of what the United Kingdom or any section of it can afford to spare, nor in excess of what the Dominions can conveniently absorb. It is essential, if this result is to be secured, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be in a position to furnish intending emigrants with accurate information, in order to direct them to those parts of the Empire where opportunities are really best, and not merely to those which are most advertised or to which emigration is most generously subsidised. It should also be in a position to warn them in time of adverse conditions overseas, which may make it desirable to discourage the flow of emigration. This is one of the main reasons which make it necessary to set up an effective central organisation in this country, and to entrust it with statutory powers to enable it to exercise some degree of check and control over the information disseminated through private, and often financially interested, channels.The question arises whether the Government should go further, and either grant State-aid to emigration or impose restrictions upon it. It is impossible to adopt a policy of complete hisses faire, because the Dominion Governments do, in fact, in various ways, actively encourage emigration ; and their action, though broadly speaking beneficial to themselves and to the Empire, may in certain cases, e.g., by the depletion of the agricultural population, inflict injury on the United Kingdom. Emigration from this country is also encouraged by important business and philanthropic interests.It is obviously impracticable, even if it were desirable, to interfere with the liberty of the subject, and attempt to check emigration by direct restriction. If it is necessary to prevent excessive emigration from the ranks of any industry in the United Kingdom, and particularly from agriculture, the proper course would presumably be to make the conditions of the industry in question more attractive.On the other hand, a consideration of the strength and volume of emigration in recent years does not indicate the need of artificial stimulation of emigration as a whole. It is, in fact, reasonably certain that even iu the absence of any special encouragement, emigration, when resumed, will be upon a considerable scale.  It is even possible that it may be inconveniently large.There does not, therefore, seem to be sufficient reason for departing from the established policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government of refusing to grant State-aid upon any considerable scale to emigration in general, beyond such aid as is involved in the improvement of communications and the encouragement of the flow to the Dominions of the capital which is essential to all development, and consequently to the influx of popu-lation. In other words, while it is desirable to multiply general facilities for Imperial development and communication, thus incidentally facilitating migration within the Empire on natural lines, it is not, as a general rule, necessary or desirable artificially to stimulate the emigration of individuals as such.On the other hand, there may be a case for direct State-aid as a corrective to conditions which have arisen from the absence of regulation in the past or from special causes such as the War, e.y., the excess of women in She United Kingdom and the deficiency of women in the Dominions, or the existence in this country of a . large number of poor children whose position and prospects in life would be better overseas than they would be here.a * o * * * *The case of the ex-service men stands on a plane of its own. Here the general economic considerations outlined above are largely subordinated to the direct obligation of giving substantial advantages and the widest possible range of opportunities to the men who have served in the war. This is recognised by all the Governments of the Empire in the treatment of their men. The Dominion Governments and the British Government alike have provided for, or are committed to, considerable schemes of land settlement.* * * * * * *It will naturally be the desire of the British Government in the first instance to give these various advantages and facilities to those who wish to remain at home. We believe, however, that the services contain large numbers of men who are determined, in any case, to settle in other parts of the Empire. Many thousands of them are men who would already have emigrated but for the War. In many cases the War has&apos; meant the loss of savings accumulated with a view to emigration and subsequent settlement overseas. It would be wholly inconsistent with the principle of giving our ex-service men the widest range of opportunity for improving their individual prospects after the War if we refused them all the assistance they would other-wise be entitled to, unless they remained in the United Kingdom. It seems only equitable that those ex-service men who wish to settle in the Dominions should be, according to their qualifications, entitled to similar assistance to that which they would have received at home, though not necessarily on&apos;as substantial a scale.The argument on the ground of equity is reinforced by practical considerations. The immediate future will necessarily be a period of industrial unsettlement. It may not prove possible for home industry and agriculture to absorb all the men whose place has to so large an extent been filled up during the War. For a year or two there will be a serious shortage of housing accommodation, not least in agricultural districts. The facilities for agricultural training may well prove insufficient for the total number of men willing to settle on the land at home or overseas. The acquisition of land for small holdings, involving the displacement of existing farmers and the training of the new small holders, must inevitably be a gradual process. Universities and Technical and Agricultural Colleges in this country are likely to be overcrowded for some years to come. All these considerations make it prudent as well as just that the generosity of the State to those who have served it well should be extended, in some measure at any rate, to those of them who wish to acquire a new domicile, though not a new allegiance, in some other part of the Empire.The recommendations contained in the memorandum were summarised as follows :-1. That the migration of population from the United Kingdom to other parts of the Empire is calculated to promote the economic strength and the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and of tho United Kingdom in particular, provided that the flow at any time is not in excess of what the industries of the United Kingdom can afford to spare or in excess of what the Dominions can conveniently absorb ;2. That in order to secure this object, it is essential that full and accurate information as to tho conditions and prospects throughout the Empire should be widely disseminated, and that reasonable safe-guards should be provided against the dissemination of deliberately misleading information ;.3. That there is, at present, no sufficient reason for the direct grant of State aid toj emigration iu general, beyond the aid involved in the improvement and cheapening of inter-Imperial communications ;
4. That there are, however, special grounds for granting State-aid to the emigration of women, and for supplementing the existing provision for the emigration of juveniles, more particularly of girls, by direct Government grants;5. That, as a reward for their services in the war, ex-service men who wish to go to other parts of the Empire, and are either bond-fide settlers on the land or have definite offers of other suitable employment, should be entitled, within three years of their demobilisation, to a free passage to their destination for them-selves and their dependents;6. That whatever financial assistance for the purpose of general or technical education or agricultural training is afforded to selected classes of ex-service men in the United Kingdom, similar assistance should be afforded, though not necessarily on as substantial a scale, to men of the same type who prefer to avail themselves of such opportunities elsewhere in the Empire ;7. That whatever financial assistance is afforded by way of advances to selected ex-service men to facilitate settlement upon the land in this country, similar advances should be made to the responsible authorities in the Dominions in respect of such men if they prefer to avail themselves of the facilities for land settlement offered overseas, but that such advances should not, as a rule, exceed half the sums advanced in the case of men taking up holdings under similar conditions in this country ;8. That if any Dominion should see fit to submit schemes for development, which would afford employ ment and settlement for ex-service men from the United K ingdom equally with those of the. Dominion in question, His Majestys Government should favourably consider the possibility of advancing reasonable sums for giving effect to such schemes.9. That all arrangements with regard to emigration should be subject to the closest consultation and co-operation with the responsible Government authorities in the several Dominions ;10.&apos;- That, while there should be no encouragement given to emigration outside the British Empire, emigrants who contemplate settling in foreign countries should be furnished with accurate information, though such information should be more limited in extent than that provided with regard to the British Empire.7. GRANT OF PASSAGES TO EX-SERVICE MEN AND EX-SERVICEWOMEN.The Committee&apos;s recommendation regarding the grant of free passages to ex-service men was substantially accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The decision of the Government, which was announced in the House of Commons on the 8th of April, 1919, was that ex-service men, viz.. officers and men of the Royal Navy, the British Army (excluding Dominion and Colonial Forces) or the Royal Ail&apos; Force, who have served in the present war, and who wish to settle within the Empire overseas, may obtain free third class passages at the lowest Government rate for themselves and their dependanls to the nearest cDnvenient port to their destination, provided that they are approve;! under one of the agricultural settlement schemes of the Oversea Governments, or are going to assured employment and are otherwise acceptable to the Government of the territory to which they desire to go.This privilege extends to the widows and dependents of ex-service men, and to ex-service women. The terms &quot;ex-service woman &quot; and &quot;dependants &quot; are defined in a leaflet issued by the Committee.The grant of free passages will include the grant of a third class railway warrant from the place of residence to.the port of embarkation, but will not include any assistance in respect of the cost of the journey from the port of disembarkation overseas to the settler&apos;s final destination.It has been arranged that applications may be sent in at any time up to the end of December, 1920, or within one year from the date of release from service, whichever date is the later, provided that in case of persons enlisted or enrolled or granted a commission for a period exceeding three years applications must be sent in before the 1st of January, 1921.The Scheme is being worked as follows : Application must be made to the Committee on forms provided for the purpose. On these forms the applicants give details of their war service and indicate the part of the Empire in which they desire to settle. When the war service has been verified by the Committee, the application is forwarded to the representative of the Oversea Government concerned, with whom it rests to decide whether the applicant can b? accepted as a suitable settler. The decision of the Oversea Repre-sentative is notified to the Committee, and, if it is favourable, the Committee furnish the approved applicant with a warrant book containing a 3rd class passage voucher, a 3rd class railway ticket to the port of embarkation, and a form of passport.No special shipping accommodation is provided by the Government, and after the receipt of their warrant books applicants make their own arrangements for booking their passages.- If they so desire, they can travel by a higher class than third on payment to the Shipping Company of the excess fare, on which most of the Shipping Companies have agreed to allow a further special abate-ment.It is uncertain what number of those who are entitled to free passages under the scheme will avail themselves of the privilege, and it is, therefore, impossible to estimate the amount of the expenditure which will be required. But the expenditure is roughly computed at  50,000 up to the 31st of March next, and at about  1,000,000 in each of the two ensuing years.Particulars of tho applications dealt with during the year will be found in Part II.8,-WOMEN.For many reasons the Committee consider it particularly important that His Majesty&apos;s Government should specially supervise the arrangements in this country connectel with the settle-ment overseas of women from the United Kingdom.A.  Women&apos;s Mission. Shortly after their appointment the Committee were approached, on behalf of the Women&apos;s War Services Committee, by tlie Chairman of the Womens Legion, with a
213request that representative women should be sent to the self-governing Dominions to enquire as to the prospects of suitable openings in those Dominions for women belonging to the War Services and to the Land Army. In Adew of this request the Treasury, acting upon the recommendation of the Committee, agreed to provide funds for the purpose of the proposed enquiry ; and it was arranged, with the concurrence of the Dominion Governments, that women delegates should proceed to Canada, Australia and New Zealand to ascertain on the spot the extent of the openings likely to be available for women from the United Kingdom, and especially for those who, during the war, have entered into new avenues of employment in this country.The mission to Canada was undertaken by Miss F. M. Girdler, a member of the staff of the Oversea Settlement Office, and Miss Gladys Pott,, Travelling Inspector of the Women&apos;s Branch of the Board of Agriculture. The delegates left in April, and concluded their enquiries in September. Their Report [Cmd. 403] has already been laid before Parliament, and has attracted considerable public attention. It is, therefore, unnecessary to give more than the briefest summary of its contents. It is, in the opinion of the Committee, an able and constructive document; it shows clearly that at the present time the chief openings for women settlers in the Dominion are in domestic service, but it indicates the possibility of developing openings in other directions. It shows that the women&apos;s organisations throughout the Dominion are deeply interested in the problem of settlement. It also shows that the Dominion Government is anxious to secure the co-operation of these organisations in welcoming new women settlers and caring for their welfare, and that that Government proposes to assist them by means of subsidies to maintain hostels for the reception of women settlers.The Report also indicates the importance of careful selection in this country, and draws attention to the dissatisfaction expressed on all sides in Canada with the system under which settlers were brought to the Dominion before the war. That system was based on the employment of agents, who were paid a bonus often amounting to several pounds per head for the recruiting of women, and certain other classes of settlers in the United Kingdom. This bonus system is further dealt with in Section 1.4.The Mission to Australia is being carried out by Miss D. Pughe Jones, a member of the V.A.D., who was principal Administrator at Salonika during the war, and has practical knowledge of farming in the United Kingdom, and by Mrs. M. T. Simm, who has acted during the war as Chief Women&apos;s Representative of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour. In view of the fact that neither of these delegates have previously visited Australia they are being accompanied by Miss M. Chomley of the Australian Red Cross.The Mission to New Zealand is being carried out by Miss Girdler and Miss G. Watkin, Technical Inspector of the Women&apos;s Branch of the Board of Agriculture. It is unlikely that the Reports of the delegates toj Australia and New Zealand will be in the hands of the Committee before April or May next.B. Advisory Committee. It has been the aim of the Committee to secure the co-operation and help of the various societies and women&apos;s organisations which are directly or indirectly interested in the settlement of women within the Empire or in their emigration to foreign countries, and with a view to securing this co-operation it was decided to appoint an Advisory Committee on Women&apos;s Emigration, composed of representatives of the bodies in question. This Advisory Committee has assisted the Committee with useful advice and has brought them into close relation-ship with the leading voluntary Societies. *C. Establishment of New Organisation. Throughout the year the Committee have become more and more convinced of the desirability of securing the establishment of some organisation which, whilst retaining the valuable characteristics of: a voluntary society, should yet be sufficiently strong to assist not only the Home Government but also the emigration departments of the various Dominion Governments in matters connected with the selection, departure and supervision on the voyage of women leaving this country for the purpose of settling overseas.Shortly after their appointment the Committee entered into communication with the three old established societies represented by the Joint Council of Women&apos;s Emigration Societies, namely, the British Women&apos;s Emigration Association, the South African Colonisation Society, and the Colonial Intelligence League. It will be recalled that these Societes, to which the Young Women&apos;s Christian Association and Girls&apos; Friendly Society, were affiliated for emigration purposes, :were commended by the Empire Settlement Committee as having always maintained, a high standard of selection in connection with emigration.It was arranged with their concurrence that representatives of the Women&apos;s War&apos;Services Committee, comprising the Women&apos;s Legion, the Queen Mary&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps, the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service, the Women&apos;s Royal Air Force, the Voluntary Aid Detachment, and the Women&apos;s Land Army, should be invited to join the Council of the Societies. Both the Societies and the War Services Committee expressed the wish to co-operate closely with each other in connection with oversea settlement, and also urged that their work should be brought as far as possible under Government control.On the 8th April, Lord Milner addressed a Meeting convened by the three Societies. In the course of his remarks he indicated that the problem of oversea settlement had been greatly enlarged by the war. He pointed out that grave responsibility rested upon the Oversea Settlement Committee whose duty it was to secure the most effective co-operation of the agencies engaged ih this work and to prevent the squandering of effort by badly no-ordinated action.    He considered
that the Government should give a great deal more help and guidance in connection with women&apos;s migration than it had given in the past, i.c, should incur a certain amount of expenditure for this purpose.As a result of this speech the three societies decided to dissolve and merge themselves into a single body which would be in a position to expand and to absorb any other elements necessary to give it an adequately representative character. In announcing this decision to Lord Milner they indicated that financial assistance from the Government would be necessary to enable them to carry on their work.It was not until the month of October that it was possible definitely to assure the newly formed organisation, now named &quot; The Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women &quot; that they would receive a temporary grant from the Treasury of  5,000 a year.The Oversea Settlement Committee undertook to supervise the expenditure of the grant on behalf of the Treasury and they forthwith proceeded to consider, in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Women&apos;s Emigration and the Society for the Oversea Settlement of British Women, whether in the new circumstances it A^ould be desirable to make any changes in the constitution. To assist them in coining to a decision on these questions, they appointed a Commission composed of Mr. Geoffrey Dawson (Chairman), Dame Katharine Furse and Miss Gladys Pott, to advise them on the subject. Following the report of the Commission, they submitted to the Society certain proposals based upon its recommendations. The object of these proposals was to make the Society sufficiently representative of the chief interests concerned, including organised labour and the chief women&apos;s organisations throughout the country, and at the same time to furnish it with a small elected Executive, for the discharge of its ordinary current work. It was proposed that the Local Employment Committees of the Ministry of Labour should form the nucleus of the provincial organisation of the Society, and that they should combine with the Local War Pensions Committees and other bodies, including a definite proportion of the members of the Provincial branches of the Voluntary Societies interested in the work of oversea settlement, to interview applicants and report upon their suitability, etc.The Committee&apos;s proposals were forwarded to the Society for consideration at the eud of December, and they have recently learnt with much satisfaction that the Society has decided to accept them.Mr. Dawson&apos;s Commission laid stress on the need for bringing the Society into close touch with the Government, and the representatives of the self-governing Dominions. With this object in view they urged thai the Headquarters of the Society should be removed at once from the Imperial Institute to a more central situation, if possible, to the same building as contains the staff of the Oversea Settlement Committee. The Committee agree that this change is essential and they are making the necessary representations to the Office of Works.The Committee have had to consider the question whether the Society for the Oversea Scttle-raent of British Women, which at present holds a licence as a passenger agent, should in future be allowed to accept commissions from the Shipping Companies in respect of the booking of passages. The competition of Voluntary Societies in the business of booking passages is resented by the regular passenger agents, and this objection may be felt even more strongly in the case of a Society, which is in receipt of a grant in aid from Government funds and whose activities receive special encouragement from the Government. The Committee consider that it is not at present necessary to interfere in the matter. But they have laid it down that any commissions received shall be credited to a special fund for the benefit of women settlers, and shall not be credited to the general funds of the Society, and that the Society should not exercise pressure upon those who come to it for selection or advice to book through it rather than through any other agency.9-CHILDREN.A sound and well regulated system has been in existence siuce 1888 for the settlement in Canada of Poor Law and other suitable children from the United Kingdom.Under this system children are scut to Canada through recognised Children&apos;s Emigration Societies in this country. Those Societies maintain Receiving Homes in the Dominion, from which the children are distributed to carefully selected families. Annual inspection of each child by the responsible Society is rigidly insisted upon by the Provincial Legislatures, whilst the Dominion Government also makes periodical inspections of the Receiving Homes. The inspectors have plenary power .to remove a child if the home is not in every way satisfactory, or if the child proves to be in any way unacceptable.In this connection the Committee have had the advantage of a full discussion of the subject with Mr. Bogue Smart, the Chief Inspector of British Immigrant Children and Receiving Homes in Canada, who was in England in July. They are satisfied that the supervision exercised by Mr. Smart and his Staff is thoroughly sympathetic and efficient, and that no effort is spared to promote the welfare of the children.I1 he Committee regard this form of oversea settlement as highly beneficial alike from the point of view of the children themselves, of the Mother Country, and of the Empire overseas, and they would welcome its further development. In this matter they share the views-of Lord Tennyson&apos;s Committee on Agricultural Settlement in the British Colonies (1906) and of the Dominions Royal Commission (1917). They realise that careful selection and strict supervision are required, but they consider that the success of the system in Canada justifies similar experiments in other parts of the Empire.The Committee have also been inclose touch with the Child Emigration Society of Oxford, which for a number of years has provided orphan boys from this country with a, sound general
education and a thorough training in farm life at the Society &apos;s Farm School at Pinjarra in &quot;Western Australia. This school, which has been under the charge of Mr. Kingsley Fairbridge, has proved so successful that the Society contemplates an extension of its scope. It is proposed that two hundred orphans should be adopted and trained, and that&apos; a proportion of these should be girls. The extended scheme is favourably regarded by the Committee and will be financially supported by the Joint Committee of the National Eelief Fund and the Oversea Settlement Committee subject to satisfactory arrangements being arrived at with the Government of Western Australia.10.-GRANTS FOR TRAINING OVERSEAS.During the year His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to make provision for enabling suitable ex-service men to pursue courses of higher education at Universities or other approved institutions, and tc take up training in agriculture and in offices and works in the United Kingdom.In this connection it was represented that a certain number of candidates might prefer to take their training in other parts of the Empire overseas or in foreign countries, and it was felt that an extension of the scheme on these lines would be productive of benefits which would not be confined to the individuals themselves. The Committee are glad to note that these considerations were accepted, and that in a limited number of cases, and for special reasons, the scheme has been extended accordingly.It is understood that up to date 32 candidates have been granted allowances for training at Universities in the various Dominions, and 24 for training in agriculture in the Dominions, Rhodesia and.East Africa.11.-HOSTELS.The responsibility which rests upon the Governments of various parts of the Empire in connection with oversea settlement involves the supervision of the Arrangements for the accommo-dation of settlers on their journeys to their destinations. An important part of this work is the provision of suitable hostel accommodation. This is essential overseas, where distances are great and other suitable accommodation often unavailable. &quot; In Canada, for instance, there is a regular system of hostels from Eant to West, which receive a subsidy from the Canadian Government and are subject to Government inspection and control. In this country, the case is different. The majority of passengers can arrange to reach the port of departure on the day of sailing, and a considerable amount of hostel and lodging accommodation is available at those ports. It is, however, considered desiiable, especially in the interests of women settlers, that small hostels under Government control fhould be established, at any rate, in London and Liverpool.This view is strongly held not only by all the voluntary societies connected with the oversea settlement of women, but also by the various labour associations and Trade Unions.It is felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot at the present time be asked to incur any heavy expenditure on this branch of oversea settlement. The proposed hostels, which should, if space admits, also be available for British subjects from overseas who are visiting the United Kingdom, should be run on a paying basis, but as no responsible Society is prepared to undertake the work of providing a hostel for settlers in transit without some small assistance from the Government, and as the Committee agree with the view that it is important to secure the establish-ment of hostels at London and Liverpool under Government control, the Committee favour.such small Government grant as may be necessary for this purpose.An offer submitted on behalf of the Young Men&apos;s Christian Association to establish and manage a hostel of 60 beds at Liverpool subject only to Government assistance to the extent of  1,750 for capital outlay has recently been under consideration.12.-TRAINING.The question whether persons intending to settle overseas should receive special training either before their departure from the United Kingdom or upon their arrival overseas has formed the subject of much consideration and discussion.At the beginning, of the year enquiries were made as to whether the special courses of training in agriculture, which were provided by the Dominion Governments for the benefit of suitable members of their own Expeditionary Forces, whilst they were awaiting repatriation from this country, could also be extended to service or ex-service men belonging to the Forces of the United Kingdom. The Canadian Authorities were anxious to co-operate, but repatriation proceeded more rapidly than had been anticipated, and it was not found possible to give effect to the proposed scheme.An interesting experiment in the provision of training (agricultural and also general) was undertaken by the Khaki University of Canada for the soldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force ; and suitable training under this scheme was extended to wives and fiancees, and also to other English women and girls contemplating settlement in the Dominion. The main work was carried on in London through the classes of the London County Council with additional instruction by Canadian experts. The subjects covered a wide range, including home organisation, infant care, nursing, laundry, dairying, poultry-farming, gardening, dressmaking, home nursing, health, etc. Colonel Tory, the Principal of the Khaki University, and Captain Sleep, the Executive Head of the University in London, furnished the Committee with full and interesting particulars of this expert ment. The importance of providing a short preliminary training in these Islands for persons who intend to settle on the land overseas was specially urged by Colonel Tory, who considered that such training would be of great use not only from the knowledge of Canadian methods which it would
impart, but also as a means of eliminating those who are not really suitable for life overseas. The Committee do not consider that the provision in this country of a brief course of training, i.e., a test of suitability such as Colonel Tory suggested, would be inconsistent with the view of the Empire Settlement Committee [Cd. 8672] that training for settlement on the land overseas is best obtained in the Dominions themselves.To the great regret of the Committee it was found impossible to continue the special training in Canadian methods after the work of the Khaki University came to an end in July. The Canadian Government have, however, been informed in an official despatch from Lord Milner that, should they deem it desirable from the standpoint of the Dominion to establish permanently in this country any system of training similar to that furnished by the Khaki University, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad to assist them, through the Oversea Settlement Committee, subject only to the reservation that it would not be possible to pledge His Majesty&apos;s Government to expenditure from Imperial Funds specifically for the training of persons who intend to exchange their domicile in the United Kingdom for a domicile in one of the Oversea Dominions., It has been urged that steps should be taken to provide short courses of training in maternity, mothercraft and house work for young wives and other women proceeding to the Oversea Dominions. There would undoubtedly be much advantage in such training, and it has been ascertained that such courses, which would probably last not less than three months, could be provided by the National Association of Infant Welfare under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour, etc. Funds would, however, be required to defray the cost of the training and, presumably, in many cases to pay for the maintenance of women undergoing these courses.13.-SETTLERS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM.It is often stated that the newly arrived settler from the United Kingdom proves unsuited to the life overseas and is, therefore, less welcome in the self-governing Dominions than might reason-ably be expected. The Committee have received more evidence in support of this view than it would be safe to ignore. By some the apparent unsuitability of many of the newly arrived settlers from the United Kingdom is attributed to inherent defects of character. The Committee are unable to accept this view. They are prepared to admit that the inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and perhaps especially the English, adapt themselves less easily to new conditions than do the inhabitants of certain other countries. On the other hand, they believe that, once adapted to their new con-ditions, the English are fully equal to any other type of settler. In their view the unpopularity of the new settler from the United Kingdom, in so far as it exists, is attributable chiefly to the following causes: Firstly Settlement overseas or, to use in this connection the more invidious term; &quot;emigration,&quot; has undoubtedly in the past been regarded by certain schools of thought as a suitable method of pro-viding for those who, for one reason or another, had proAred unsatisfactory citizens of the mother country. Hence the contempt with which the &quot; remittance man &quot; has been regarded overseas. The above view is no longer held in any responsible quarter, and wc need not dwell upon it.Secondly It is probable that certain of the voluntary societies have perhaps at times in the past interested themselves in, and endeavoured to promote, settlement overseas too much with a view to relieving distress and misery at home and too little with a view to providing the Oversea Dominions with carefully selected and suitable settlers. In making this observation the Committee in no way depreciate or fail to recognise the noble character of much of the work of philanthropic individuals and voluntary societies in connection with oversea settlement. They are confident that it has not only been humane but also of real value to the Empire.Thirdly Propaganda of an unduly optimistic character. The Committee believe that such propaganda is to be deprecated not only because it tends to appeal to the ignorant and credulous, who are prima facie unlikely to prove suitable settlers overseas, but also because it produces an actually deterrent effect upon the minds of the more enlightened classes of the community.Fourthly Them is perhaps a tendency overseas to restrict the term &quot; English &quot; to newly arrived settlers from England, who have not yet adapted themselves to their new circumstances. As they adapt themselves they merge in the general population and become Australians, Canadians, etc. Thus the term English has been chiefly applied to those Englishmen who succeed slowly, or fail to succeed.Fifthly The Bonus System, which is dealt with in the following Section.14.-THE BONUS SYSTEM.The arrangements which were in force before the war for the recruiting of settlers, sale of steerage passages, etc., are set out in paragraph 33 of the second Interim Report of the Dominions Royal Commission.Briefly the sale of steerage tickets was and still is in the hands of passage brokers and their agents, both brokers and agents receiving remuneration from the Shipping Companies in the shape of a commission upon each ticket sold.Passenger agents have little concern as to the personal suitability of intending settlers, and the system of remunerating them by means of commissions (usually, it is understood, five per cent., and therefore varying in amount in accordance with the destination of each passenger) is not an ideal one. Some members of the Committee would be glad if it w3re possible to substitute other arrange-ments for it. The commission system is, however, generally convenient to the public, and is regarded by the shipping companies as essential to their business. The leading passenger agents, with whom the Committee have been in close touch, are evidently anxious to carry on their business
220with due regard to the interests of settlers. In the circumstances the Committee as a whole see no reason to interfere with the system subject to its being adequately supervised and controlled on the lines recommended by the Dominions Royal Commission.They feel, however, that there is a wide difference between the commissions paid by shipping companies to local agents throughout the country in respect of the booking of passages (commissions in these cases being substantially remuneration for the labour involved) and the additional commis-sions paid under the &quot;bonus &quot; system, &quot;which is criticised in the Report of the women delegates to Canada.Under this system, which has been in existence for many years, and was extensively used before the war for the recruiting of those classes of settlers who are chiefly needed overseas, bonuses were paid to agents in this country (who in all cases took out licences as shipping agents) for recruiting, and to agents overseas for collecting and distributing, settlers of the classes required.It is understood that the bonuses paid for the recruiting of settlers by individuals, companies and local authorities overseas, as well as by certain of the Overseas Governments, may amount in the aggregate in certain cases to as much as  3 to  5 in spite of the safeguards provided by the Dominion Government.The Committee see no reason for taking exception to the offer of direct bonuses to persons in this country as an inducement to proceed overseas provided that such offers were only made after reasonable consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government. The case is, however, entirely different when a substantial bonus is offered to third parties, who may be wholly ignorant of con-ditions overseas, are little concerned with the suitability of prospective settlers, and are remunerated-rated in proportion to the success of their efforts, to induce men and women in this country to proceed overseas. A system of this kind cannot be defended. There is abundant evidence, including evidence of a recent and convincing character, that the system has failed to supply the British communities overseas with settlers of the type they require, and has in fact been a source of grave abuse.The Committee understand that certain voluntary societies in this country have from time to time received bonuses for the recruiting of settlers. They believe that this practice exposes the societies to criticism, and they are of opinion that it should be abandoned.A better system for the recruiting of suitable settlers, which Was adopted before the war by the Government of certain of the Oversea Dominions, is that of granting assisted and nominated passages, i.e., passages at special rates to certain classes of settlers, including women who were prepared to take up domestic service, and near relatives of persons already settled overseas.15.-INDUSTRIAL AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT OVERSEAS.In the matter of employment, and especially of industrial employment, the problem with which the Committee are confronted is that of ascertaining when and where suitable openings are available in other parts of the Empire and in foreign countries for those persons in this country who dtsire to better their prospects and obtain more remunerative work in other parts of the world.It is, of course, abundantly clear that the only openings at present available for any considerable . number of settlers from this country in the self-governing Dominions, and probably in other parts of the world, are for men who are prepared to settle upon the land, and for women who intend to enter domestic service ; but this section of the Report has reference to the more limited openings which are available outside the United Kingdom for certain classes of its industrial population.It would be idle to ignore the fact that any considerable influx into the Dominions of industrial workers from the United Kingdom or any other country would under present conditions be likely to disorganise the local labour markets, and would therefore be vehemently opposed. There is, however, from time to time a demand foi workersjn certain industries, both in the self-governing Dominions and abroad, which cannot be supplied from the local labour market, and the Committee are co-operating with the Ministry of Labour, with a view to obtaining adequate information as to openings of this nature outside the United Kingdom, circulating the necessary particulars amongst the local offices of the Ministry, and bringing them to the notice of suitable applicants.Provisional arrangements for notifying such openings have been in force since 1910. It was felt, however, that a more satisfactory system of dealing with the question was required, and that it was desirable to consider the possibility of arriving at a general understanding with the Govern-ments of the self-governing Dominions.It was decided in the first instance to approach the Canadian Government. An officer of the Ministry of Labour, acting in liaison with the Oversea Settlement Office, was accordingly sent to Ottawa towards the end of April with the object of discussing with the authorities there the best means of procuring full and up-to-date information, and of ascertaining whether the machinery of the Employment Offices in the Dominion could be brought into co-operation with the corresponding organization of the Ministry of Labour in the United Kingdom. The exchange of views which then took place is now being followed up by formal representations to the Canadian Government.Subsequent consultations between the Employment and Appointments Departments of the Ministry of Labour led to the appointment of an Inter-Departmental Committee for the purpose of directing and co-ordinating the work of oversea employment. This Committee is composed of representatives of the Oversea Settlement Committee, the India Office, the Department of Overseas Trade, and the Ministry of Labour.The Executive Officer of the Committee and his staff are accommodated in the same premises as the staff of the Oversea Settlement Committee, and work in co-operation with them.
During the three months ended the 31st December offers of employment for some two thousand industrial workers from this country have been received from the self-governing Dominions and other sources abroad. - These openings, which are chiefly for women, are connected principally with the textile trades.The possibility of formulating a general scheme for dealing with oversea vacancies throughout the self-governing Dominions in other parts of the Empire, and in foreign countries, is now under consideration. The essential thing in the case of the self-governing Dominions, is to ensure that no action is taken with a view to filling industrial vacancies except at the request of the Govern-ment ot the Dominion concerned, and with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.16.-GRANT FROM NATIONAL RELIEF FUND.During the month of March the Committee approached the Executive Committee of the National Relief Fund with the object of supporting applications to the Fund for assistance for purposes of oversea settlement from the Committee of the Women&apos;s War Services and from the Church Army.The Executive of the National Relief Fund replied that they were prepared to consider symphathetically the question of making a grant in aid of a comprehensive scheme. They explained that as the Fund had been subscribed solely for the relief of war distress any grant from the Fund in aid of oversea settlement or emigration could only be applied to the assistance of those who had suffered directly or indirectly as a result of the war. Further negotiations followed, as a result of which the Committee of the National Relief Fund decided to appropriate a sum of  250,000 for the benefit of persons who have suffered as a result of the war and would be more usefully helped by assistance to settle overseas than in any other way. They intimated at the same time that they would be prepared to make such additional grants as may be found to be necessary up to a maximum of  500,000 in all. The grant is being administered by a Joint Oommittee, composed of representatives of the National Relief Fund and the Oversea Settlement Committee. The Joint Committee does not deal directly with individual applicants, but requires that each application should be submitted through responsible authorities. Every recipient of a grant must, as in the case of the Government Free Passage Scheme, be accepted as a suitable settler by the Government of the part of the Empire to which he or she intends to proceed. The Oversea Settlement Committee and the Joint Committee will, in future, also consider cases which have hitherto been dealt with by the King&apos;s Fund.17.-SCHEMES FOR LAND SETTLEMENT OVERSEAS.Particulars of the schemes for land settlement of ex-service men and other settlers which have been arranged by the Governments of the self-governing Dominions, the British South Africa Company, the Government of British East Africa,* etc., are to be found in the Committee&apos;s handbooks, and are not included in the present Report. Apart from the Government schemes and the schemes of certain large and well-known companies overseas, various smaller projects apparently of a satisfactory character have been brought under the notice of the Committee.The attention of the Committee has repeatedly been drawn to the activities of certain individuals and companies who have endeavoured, by means of widespread advertisements, to induce ex-service men and others to embark capital, in some cases within, in others outside, the Empire, in land settlement schemes of a speculative or undesirable character. These schemes appear to afford no reasonable prospect of success to settlers.It has been the policy of the Committee to issue warnings in the public press in connection with advertisements of this nature.   These warnings are printed in Appendix I.Warning A, which deals with the Island of Palmitos del Verde was issued in consequence of information furnished by the British Consular Authorities in Mexico. Immediately after the warning had been published the Committee received a communication from a resident in Cheshire, who stated that he had been induced by a prospectus shown him by an American friend to contem-plate settling on the island, but that, in view of the Committee&apos;s warning, he had on the eve of departure cancelled his passage and abandoned the enterprise.It has unfortunately been impossible to trace the authors of the prospectus, who do not appear to be domiciled in the United Kingdom.Warning B has reference to advertisements in the Press of the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire of certain schemes, chiefly irrigation projects, in the Union of South Africa. The views of the Union Government with regard to these advertisements are clearly indicated in the following message from Cape Town, which was published in the &quot;The Times&quot; on 19th of September last: &quot; The Minister of Agriculture, Colonel Mentz, answering a question in the Senate abont some of the settlement schemes now boomed in England, said : Mr. Kanthack, the Union Director of Irrigation, who had been asked to enquire while on leave in London, found that numerous unadulterated swindles were on the market, as well as a number of other schemes which, while not objectionable to this extent, could neverthe-less only be described as catches. Scores of men of the very best class, such as retired officers with families, possessing  2,000 or  3,000, are being brought out by these utterly unscrupulous agents, only to be absolutely let down. The consequences of this kind of thing-are disastrous to the Union.* The East s fricsi Land Settlement nchsme id now clcsal,
Accordingly, Mr. Kanthack had written a pamphlet, obtainable in the London High Commissioners office, not for the purpose of discouraging immigration, but to enable any person of ordinary intelligence to use his critical faculties when reading prospectuses. If intending settlers would take the trouble to&apos; read what Mr. Kanthack had written, they would have only themselves to blame if they bought land from such companies or people of this type."                     The Committee&apos;s attention was first directed to these matters by glowing advertisements which appeared in the Press not only of the United Kingdom, but also of other parts of the Empire, particularly India and Malaya. After consultation with the Acting High Commissioner for the Union, and after ascertaining from him and from Mr. Kanthack the views of the Union Government, they decided to issue a warning notice, as the result of which they received between 50 and 100 enquiries from ex-officers and others who had invested or were thinking of investing capital in schemes of the kind in question. It is understood that an even larger number of enquiries was received at the office of the High Commissioner. It was subsequently arranged, with the concurrence of the Acting High Commissioner, that Mr. Kanthack should deliver the lecture referred to in Part II.                                                                      With a view to safeguarding the interests of settlers, the Committee have invited the representatives of the self-governing Dominions to draw their attention to any schemes of this kind which affect the Dominion, State or Province which they represent. They will also welcome similar information from any responsible quarter.                                             Warning C was issued after consultation with the Foreign Office in connection with the advertisement of a scheme for the settlement of officers in Mexico. This project is viewed with disfavour by His Majesty&apos;s Consular Representatives in Mexico, who consider it objectionable on many grounds.   The matter has now passed out of the Committee&apos;s hands.                   Warning D was issued at the request of the Colonial Office for the guidance of persons intending to settle in the East Africa Protectorate.                                                     In this connection, the Committee think it desirable to record their concurrence with the view of the Committee of the Emigrants&apos; Information Office that it is, as a general rule, dangerous for British subjects who do not possess capital of their own to proceed to such countries as Argentina, Mexico or any of the Central and South American States, unless they have obtained a definite guarantee of employment before leaving home. The languages, laws, standards of living, rates of wages, and labour conditions are so different from those at home that the chances of suitable employment in any of the countries in question are small, and the risks of destitution considerable.                                                                          18.- APPOINTMENT AGENCIES.                                                                    The Committee&apos;s attention has been called to the activities of certain firms, who advertise extensively in the Press, and purport to assist persons desiring employment in other parts of the Empire and abroad to secure suitable positions. It appears that these firms supply their clients, in return, in each case, for small fees, with lists of employers in various parts of the world, and assist them, again for a small fee, in preparing letters of application to employers, &amp;c. The Committee see no reason to doubt that the firms in question do from time to time succeed in helping their clients to find employment, but they have reason for supposing that applicants, whose letters are drafted by these firms are regarded with disfavour by many employers, and they are satisfied that the operations of such firms should be carefully watched by the Government.                                                                            19.- CASE OF FRAUD.                                                                            At the end of November, the Committee&apos;s attention was drawn by the Superintendent of Emigration for Canada to a circular issued by the " International Service League " which promised applicants " to find you a position in the course of a few weeks -- no matter what your trade is " in one of the self-governing Dominions or the United States.                                The Committee brought the matter to the notice of Scotland Yard with the result that the person styling himself the British representative of the " International Service League" was arrested, tried at the County of London Sessions on the 21st of January,&apos;1920, and sentenced to twelve months&apos; imprisonment with hard labour. It was elicited in the course of the trial that the individual in question had received in answer to his advertisements about 1,500 applications for employment abroad from all parts of the British Isles, principally from discharged soldiers and munition&apos; workers, and had obtained from these applicants not less than £40 in sums varying from sixpence to one shilling.                                                              20.- OVERSEA SETTLEMENT BILL.                                                                  In the early part of the year the Committee devoted much time to the preparation of an Oversea Settlement Bill based upon the general principles recommended by the Dominions Royal Commission. This Bill recast the provisions of the Emigration Bill, 1918, with a view to eliminating or modifying certain of its provisions which were regarded as objectionable by the Governments of the self-governing Dominions and by the leading shipping companies. The pressure of urgent legislation prevented the introduction of the amended Bill during the Session of 1919, and as, owing to the difficulty of obtaining shipping accommodation, any general resumption of oversea settlement or emigration was impossible, the Committee felt that it was unnecessary for them to press for the passage of legislation during the past session.
They are, however, convinced, and thoy believe that it will be clear from this Report, that if His Majesty&apos;s Government are to exercise the &quot; closer supervision &quot; which is urgently needed, legislation should be introduced in the forthcoming session.21.-CONCLUSION.The Committee feel it their duty to urge that the problems of oversea settlement and of emigra-tion to foreign countries are matters which deserve even closer attention than it has been possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to bestow upon them in the exceptional circumstances of the year under review. Exhaustive care has, for many years, been devoted by the Governments of the various parts of the Empire to the perfecting of agreements for the exchange&apos;of foodstuffs, raw materials, mineral products and manufactured goods. Such agreements are of the first import ance, but they will have no lasting results unless at least equal care is bestowed upon the problem of distributing and using the population of the Empire to the best advantage. The men and women of the British Empire are its true foundation. They have brought it to the present stage of its development. It is they who must defend it should the need again arise. They have in the past been drawn for the most part from the Mother Country and have carried with them overseas to the vast territories which cannot achieve their full development without a large increase of population, British energy and perseverance and British ideals of freedom and self-government. The Committee are convinced that, in the interest of the unity of the Empire and of its future defence, it is vital that the additional population which the Dominions require should be drawn from the same source in future ; but they are satisfied that if settlers of the right type are to be directed from this country to the Oversea Dominions His Majesty&apos;s Government must assume more direct responsibility in the matter.The present situation resembles in certain respects that which existed one hundred years ago, when, at the close of the Napoleonic wars, the cessation of war expenditure, the fall in wages, and other economic conditions led His Majesty&apos;s Government to embark upon a policy of State super-vision and State aid of emigration.The Committee feel that the policy then adopted and the developments of that policy during the past century are of sufficient public interest, and have a sufficient bearing on the problems which now confront the Home Government and the Governments of the self-governing Dominions, to justify them in furnishing an historical summary of the emigration policy which has been pursued during the past century.   This summary will be found in Appendix II.It is obvious that the present situation differs widely in certain respects from that which existed in 1819. Self-government was at that time unknown in the Empire overseas. Now the great Dominions of the Crown are self-governing and independent. Travelling has been made easy and distances have been largely eliminated. But now, as in 1819, the moment is opportune for a new departure. Circumstances make it imperative that His Majesty&apos;s Government should under-take, in co-operation with the representatives of the Dominions, supervision of the arrangements in this country upon which oversea settlement depends. Adequate machinery must be provided for this purpose, and a reasonable measure of State aid for certain classes of the community, i.e., women and children, may be required. Otherwise it is unlikely that it will be necessary to consider any form of. direct State aid to oversea settlement beyond such aid as may be involved in improving and cheapening inter-Imperial communications.The Committee, therefore, venture to submit the following recommendations: (1) That the problem of oversea settlement should be discussed at the earliest convenient date between the Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Governments of the self-governing Dominions who are specially responsible for such matters. &apos;(2) That with a view to making adequate the supervision which His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to exercise over the arrangements in this country connected with settle-ment overseas and emigration to foreign countries, and with a view to co-operating - adequately with the Governments of the self-governing Dominions in this the most important of all Imperial problems, they should be prepared to undertake annual expenditure, hot exceeding in 1920-21,  100,000, in addition to the expenditure to which they are committed by their undertaking to grant free, passages to approved ex-service men and ex-service women. So far as can be foreseen future expenditure will not be such as to&apos; impose a heavy burden upon the British taxpayer.(3) That they should as soon as possible introduce into Parliament, and secure the enact-ment of, legislation to empower the Oversea Settlement Committee to advise and assist intending settlers, to supervise and control passage brokers and agents, and also propaganda connected with oversea settlement or emigration.
PART II.22.-WORK OF COMMITTEE AND STAFF.The Committee held 36 meetings during the year. They considered many matters connected with oversea settlement besides those referred to in Part I, but it has bieri thought best in this, their first report, to deal only with the chief questions of principle and policy which they have had before them.The staff, which at the beginning of the year numbered 24, now numbers 60. The Committee desire to acknowledge the good work done by the staff throughout the year. The pressure of work has frequently been great. Few members of the staff have had previous training in a Government office; and their work has been hampered by the inadequate nature of the accommodation available for them, especially at the b ginning of the year, when they were housed in temporary hutments on the Horse Guards&apos; Parade, and at the end of the year when, owing to increase of work, the accommodation available in their new premises at 59, Victoria Street, became inadequate. The staff includes three men and three women with special knowledge of conditions overseas whose duty it is to give oral information and advice to any enquire! s who call at this office. The Committee have reason to believe that the services of these interviewers have been greatly appreciated by the general public.23.-STATISTICAL INFORMATION.Over 48)000 letters were received during the year, and about 11,500 callers were interviewed. Except for correspondence with other Government Offices, Voluntary Societies, &amp;c, substantially all the letters received were enquiries from individuals regarding oversea settlement ov emigration. Most of these enquiries had reference to the Government free passage scheme.The number of enquiries dealt with should not be regarded as furnishing any guide to the demand in this country for settlement overseas, as every effort has been made throughout the year to make it clear both in the Committee^ handbooks, and in their various public announcements, that virtually no shipping was available for the carriage of settlers, that no general movement would be possible before the Spring of 1920 at the earliest, and that it was, therefore, useless for intending settlers to make any early arrangements with a view to departure from this country. It is safe to assume that the number of enquiries regarding oversea settlement will largely increase when ordinary facilities for ocean travel are again available.The number-of applications for free passages under the Government scheme exceeded 10,000, covering about 18,000 persons inclusive of dependents. .The number of vouchers for free passages issued was 1,140, covering about 2,000 persons.During the latter months of the year the work of the Office markedly increased. Of the total of 48,000 letters, 30,000 were received in the period to the 31st of October, and 18,000 during the months of November and December. The number of letters which reached the Office at the beginning of 1919 averaged about 30 daily. It now averages about 450. Personal interviews numbered 8,400 up to the 31st of October, and 3,100 during November and December. As many as 100 callers are now often interviewed in one day. 5,000 applications for free passages were received before the 31st of October, and 5,200 during November and December.24.-EXPENDITURE.The total cost of the Office staff for the year ending the 31st of March, 1920, including the salaries,and expenses ot the women delegates to the Self-governing Dominions and the salary of the Vice-Chairman and of one other member of the staff at present borne ou the Colonial Office vote, is estimated at approximately  15,380.The total cost of the staff during the financial year 1920-21, including that of the Oversea Employment and Appointments Branch, which is provided for out of the vote for the Ministry of Labour, is roughly computed at  21,000.25.-PUBLICATIONS.The Committee attach great importance to the responsibility which devolves upon them in collecting and disseminating authentic and up-to-date information.They arc satisfied that the issue of reliable publications should materially assist intending settlers in their choice of the destination and occupation best suited to their individual circumstances.They have, therefore, devoted special attention to the compilation of suitable publications.No Handbooks were issued by the Emigrants&apos;Information Office after 1915,and little information was available at the beginning of 1919 as to the effect of the war upon economic conditions overseas. Sonic difficulty was, therefore, naturally experienced in collecting accurate and up-to-date informa-tion for the necessary Handbooks. Valuable assistance has, however, been received from tho Oversea Governments and from numerous public bodies in the self-governing Dominions; and arrangements are now being made for the complete and systematic supply of the requisite information through official channels.
21st February, 1920.The Canadian Government has already undertaken to supply the Committee with regular quarterly reports relating to wages, cost of living, housing conditions, employment, &amp;c, and the Committee have no doubt that reports of a similar character will be furnished from other parts of the Empire.The following is a list of the publications issued during the year, showing the numbers circulated up to 31st December, 1919 : 1.   Official Statement for the use of ex-service officers and men who may desireto settle in other parts of the Empire       ...      .........   ....     90,0002.

Handbook (Part I) on South Africa and Rhodesia.2. Handbook on Canada (Part II.)3. Handbook on Australia (Part II.)4. Handbook on Newfoundland.5. Handbook on Nyasalaiid.6. Handbook on the Federated Malay States.7. Handbook on Ceylon.8. Handbooks on the West African Colonies.9. Handbooks on the West Indian Colonies (numbering seven in all).&apos;  10. Handbook on Uganda.11. Circular relating to the United States of America.12. Professional Handbook (to be issued in four parts).A few additional handbooks are in course of preparation.The information contained in the handbooks has in certain cases been supplemented by public lectures delivered under the committee&apos;s auspices by persons who possessed personal experience of farming and other conditions in various parts of the Empire.A lecture on the East Africa Protectorate was delivered by Major Ewart Grogan, D.S.O., who has lived for some years in the country and has the fullest knowledge of its agriculture. Captain F. C. Alsop, who lectured on Farming and Country Life in Australia, was for many years before the Avar engaged in farming in New South Wales and Victoria. Mr. F. E. Kanthack. C.M.G., who lectured on Irrigation and Land Settlement in South Africa, has acquired, as Director of Irrigation for the Union of South Africa, official knowledge and experience of the utmost value to intending settlers in South Africa. Large numbers of copies of these lectures have been distributed, to enquirers.L. S. A MEET,Chairman,G. F. Plant,Secretary.
223APPENDIX I.WARNING A (Palmitos del Verde).The attention of the Oversea Settlement Committee has been called by the British Consular Authorities in Mexico to a scheme which is likely to be advertised in the United Kingdom with a view to inducing ex-service men to settle on the Island of Palmitos del Verde on the West Coast of Mexico.Several ventures have shown that settlement on the Island is likely to be attended with failure. The land is of an inferior quality, the water supply brackish, labour scarce and of indifferent quality, and transportation faulty. The climate in the wet season is unhealthy and unsuitable&apos; to Europeans, the Island has been raided three times by bandits, and the most recent settler, a Chinaman, was killed by robbers.WARNING B (S. Africa).The attention of the Oversea Settlement Committee has been drawn to certain very alluring advertisements of irrigation schemes in South Africa, that have recently appeared in the Press, in some cases in the form of articles nolding out prospects of an ideal career and large profits in return for a small capital investment.After consultation with the Office of the High Com-missioner for the Union of South Africa, they think it desirable to issue the following statement : Intending purchasers of holdings on any property in South Africa which is dependent upon irrigation, should carefully read the official Memorandum by P. E. Kanthack, C.M.G., Director of Irrigation for the Union of South Africa, entitled &quot; Irrigation and Land Settlement in the Union of South Africa,&quot; copies of which may be obtained free of cost on application either to the Offices of the High Com-missioner for the Union of South Africa, Victoria Street, S.W., or to the Oversea Settlement Office, 59, Victoria Street, S.W.The Committee, on behalf of tha Home Government and on behalf of the Government of the Union of South Africa, most strongly recommend persons not to buy such land in South Africa unless it has been personally inspected by themselves or by someone in whom t&apos;money have complete confidence.WARNING C (Mexico).The attention of the Oversea Settlement Committee has been called to the fact that owing to the unsettled condition of the Republic of Mexico, it is desirable that persons proposing to invest money or to settle on the land in that territory, should communicate with H.B.M. Consul General, Mexico City, before taking any definite steps in the matter. This precaution is especially necessary in the case of land settlement, in view of. the frequent disputes regarding the title to land in Mexico at the present time.WARNING D (East Africa).The Governor of the East Africa Protectorate wishes to warn intending settlers that the price of land in the Protectorate at present is high, that there are difficulties in regard to the supply of native labour and that the settlement of those who have recently been allotted land under the Government settlement scheme, will absorb for some time the resources of the Protectorate in building material, agricultural implements, &amp;c. In these circum-stances, farming in the East Africa Protectorate should not be undertaken by persons without previous local experience unless they have a capital of at least  5,000. Settlers with local experience should have a minimum capital of  1,000 and  1,500, in addition to the cost of land and all passage and incidental expenses, and should also be prepared to rough it. Men without this amount of capital should not go out unless they have obtained definite local employment before sailing.APPENDIX II.History of Emigration Policy.Emigration from this country of some description and on a limited scale began in the early part of the 17th century, Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda and Barbadoes being the fields in which our first successful attempts at colonisation may be said to have commenced.The dose of the Napoleonic wars was, however, the beginning of the modern history of emigration from the British Isles. For some years, the population&apos; of the United Kingdom had been growing rapidly, and with the end of the war there was an increasing amount of pauperism and distress. The large public debt, the cessation of war expenditure and the natural reaction after the war, together with two successive bad harvests, dislocated trade and industry and threw numbers out of employment. One method of relieving the &quot;pressure of population upon the means of subsistence&quot; which found much support was emigration. In the 18th century, no one had talked of a surplus population. Population meant national strength- and emigration was not encouraged. There was &quot;no surer way to condemn a colony than to show that it tended to diminish the population of the mother country.&quot; But in the early 19th century the removal of the redundant population to the colonies and elsewhere was urged as a means of re-lieving paupers, of reducing the poor rate, and of lessening the supply of an overstocked labour market. Wilmot Horton was one of the most zealous advccates of this course. According to Horton, low wages were the cause of pauperism ; redundancy of population the cause of low wages. The remedy was to raise wages by adjusting the proportion between capital and labour. To increase the supply of capital he considered impossible. Therefore the supply of labour must be reduced by emigration. The colonies were suffering from want of labour.  so the &quot;redundant labour and the curse of the mother country&quot; might become &quot; the active labour and the blessing of the colonies.&quot;Wilmot Horton&apos;s plan was to have a state controlled and a state aided emigration, confined to paupers. He proposed that they should be given a free passage to Canada, a free grant of 100 acres of land, with farming implements and stock, and provisions for one year; and that the Government should advance the money by way of loan to parishes on the security of the poor rate. He pointed out that the capital sum required to settle a family of four in Canada was  80, whilst the annual cost of maintaining such a family at home was  40, so that there was a great saving in the long run. The question was, however, treated by Horton quite in the abstract, as if all the paupers would be equally able to take advantage of the new conditions. One of the fore-most of Horton&apos;s critics was Edward Sibbon Wakefield, who pointed out that the type of emigrants was unsuited to the conditions overseas, and that so far from its being possible to send men out en masse, careful selection would be necessary if they were to succeed.In 1819,  50,000 had been voted by Parliament as a grant in aid of emigration to the Cape, and in 1821,  68,760 was voted as a grant in aid of emigra^on from the South of Ireland to Canada and the Cape. But in 1823 and 1825 attempts were made to put Horton&apos;s Dlan into practice on a small scale,  15,000 being voted in 1823 and  30,000 in 1825.The object was to find out whether paupers could be located in Canada at a cost less than that of their main-tenance at home, and Horton c laimed that the experiment was successful. In 1827 a further grant of  20,480 was made generally for emigration from the United Kingdom,
and Horton introduced a Bill in 1828 and again in 1830 &quot; to enable parishes to mortgage &apos;heir poor rates for the purpose of providing for their able-bodied paupers by colonisation in the Brit;sh colonies.&quot; The Bill did not go through, but a section to the above effect was inserted in the Poor Law Act of 1834. It remained a dead letter, however, because the United Kingdom was not then prepared to spend any considerable sum on emigration, even as a cnre for redundancy of population.Voluntary emigration could not be discourage I as it &quot;ur-nished an outlet for population and helped to make the colonies prosperous. It might even be regulaled by Government. But it coul i not be carried on at the public cost. So the way was cleared for Wakefield and his system.The ground work of the Wakefield system is the sufficient price for agricultural land. The difficulty in the colonies was to obtain adequate labour to work the land which was freely granted. A sufficient prre on colonial waste land would prevent labourers in a (olony from becoming landowners too soon. This would ensure a supply of combinable labour, because capitalists might then safely import laV our under agreement, as it would take a certain known time for labourers to earn as much as would enable them to buy land sufficient for their own support. Thus the colony would prosper and would relieve the mother country of surplus population and afford a new market.The question then arose what was to be done with the money obtained from the sales of colonial waste lan Wakefield laid down that it should be used as an emigra-tion fund to assist labourers to emigrate. So labour would pour into the colony much more rapidly than if there were only a sufficient price and no emigration fund, and as labour became more plentiful, the sufficient price might be lowered and the labourers term of service would become shorter and he would become a landowner sooner.The third part of Wakefield&apos;s theory was tie principle of judicious selection of emigiants. He strongly opposed the emigration of paupers.- &quot;The tendency of these pauper shovellings is to make the common people; think of emigration wit&apos;i dislike and terror.&quot; The departure of a pauper emigrant differed little from that of the convict.Wakefield recommended that preference be given to young married couples. This would check redundancy at home and secure increase abroad, where it was needed. It would also counterbalance the existing tendency to a surplus of males in the colonies.Wakefield considered that he had made out &quot;an Imperial case,&quot; and pleaded for &quot;a central authority.&quot;The fourth part of his theory was the self-government of the colonies.In 1830 a Colonisation Society was formed in order to create interest in the subject ; and in 1831 an Emigration Commission was appointed by Government. The functions of the Commissioners were limited to collecting aud diffusing information regarding the colouies which might be useful to intending emigrants. They had no funds to aid and conduct emigration, but if parishes chose to provide, them with money, they might use it in the emigration of paupers. Tho- Treasury, however, in 1831 sanctioned the appropriation of  10,000-from the land revenue of New South Wales and Tasmania to assist the emigration of females, mechanics and agricul-tural labourers. In the following year the Commission was dissolved and its functions were carried out by the Colonial Office, Mr Elliott being in charge. The policy of the Government gradually developed in the direction of granting free passages to selected emigrants of the classes named above, and in these circumstances difficulties of selection and supervision made a Government Depart-ment necessary. In 1834 accordingly Emigration Agents were appointed at seven chief ports of embarkation, at a cost of  1,457, which rapidly rose until at one time it reached  25,000 a year.In 1834 too, an Act was passed embodying WakefiekVs principles of land sales and emigration, with a view to the colonisation of South Australia. A Commission of ten administered the&apos; Act. The whole expense of emigration was to be defrayed ont of the proceeds of the land sales, and the expenses of governing and settlement were to be borne by loans raised on the security of the future revenue and the land sales. The Colony appeared to prosper, but it did so entirely on borrowed money, the Commissioners having been empowered by an amending Act to raise lo.ms on easier terms and to borrow either from revenue or from the emigration fund for the benefit of the other. TlnN power they used to borrow largely from the ernigra-iym fund for governing purposes.In 1837 His Majesty&apos;s Government appointed Mr. Elliott Agent General for Emigration. He found two methods in vogue :&apos;-(a) Government emigration.(b) Bounty&apos;emigration.The former was controlled partly by the Home and partly by the Colonial Government, the latter entirely by the Colonial G overnment. Under the former, surgeons sent home by the Colonial Government chose parties and took them out. But the plan was expensive and too many young children were taken. So Elliott appointed selecting officers and assumed the whole responsibility for managing the Government emigration.Under the latter, settlers,were supposed to introduce labourers for their own benefit; but in practice shipowners obtained bounty orders, and imported immigrants on speculation, trusting to the general fitness of the emigrants to obtain the bounties payable on their introduction. So far as mortality went the systems were very similar ; but the latter was cheaper by 21% or  4 a head, while as to quality, it was far better. It was, however, precarious and uncertain, as there was no compulsion on those who took out orders, to bring the emigrants.In the meanwhile the Wakefield system was rtcom-mended for Canada in the Durham report in 1838. In Canada much Crown land had been alienated, most of which was uncultivated. There had been extensive emi-gration, but there had been much distress and disease among the emigrants. Wakefield proposed a land tax on the alienated land with a proviso that it might be paid in land. Thus much land, it was expected, would be returned to the Crown. Crown land was then to be sold at a fixed price ; but the doctrine of sufficient price could not be strictly applied in Canada owing to low price of land in the United States of America. The proceeds of the land tax and of land sales, were to be applied partly to public works, such as means of communication, and partly to emigration of people of both sexes.This system, however, was not adopted, because it was felt that Canada was n?ar enough to the United Kingdom not to require any stimulus to emigration ; it was, in fact, only necessary to regulate the flow.The South Australian Commission was dissolved in 1839 when the Commissioners asked for a salary, and the Colonial Land and Emigration Board was established in 18iO, to undertake the duties of the Commissioners and Agent General for Emigration. It is true that South Australia was in debt. Administration had been careless and extravagant. Emigrants had not only been trans-ported free, but were maintained till they could get employment, and whenever they were unemployed, so that many preferred to work on Government works at low wages rather than try and get employment at higher wages in more distant localities. But on the other hand, a prosperous colony of 1G,000 people had been established and ove^ 200,000 acres of land had been sold; the emigrants sent out had been judiciously selected ; and the policy of land sales and emigration w as found by a Select Com-mittee of 1841, to have been proved sound as a system of establishing a new colony.By 1840 New Zealand had become a British Colony, and by the Waste Lands Act of 1842, the system of land sales, and assisted emigration was established there too.The whole system was now administered by the Emi-gration Board, whose duties were fourfold-(1) the collection and diffusion of information re-garding all the Colonies ;(2) the sale in Great Britain of land in the Colonies ;(3) the application of the proceeds to emigration ;(4) the superintending of all emigration movements connected with the United Kingdom and the dependencies.The work was complicated by spasmodic remittance of funds, which made emigration spasmodic; the fluctuations may be illustrated by the fact that in 1849 the Board had to close their office, as they had 10,000 applications to emigrate undisposed of, whilst in 1851 they were unable to obtain enough emigrants to fill the available ships,Gradually, the Board was relieved of some of its func-tions. The management of the bulk of the colonial lands was transferred by degrees to the Colonial legislatures, and in 1873 the administration of the Passenger Acts was transferred to the Board of Trade. In consequence of this decrease in the business, the Board was allowed to die out as a separate body, its remaining functions being transferred to the Board of Trade and the Colonial Office in 1878.The following figures will show the flow of emigration during the period from 1815 to 1875. In 1815 2,081 people left the country and the number increased annually
with some fluctuations until 1852, when it reached 368,764 or over 1,000 a day.During the years 1815 to 1875 the total emigration amounted to 8,286,720 persons, of whom 5,391,542 pro-ceeded to the United States of America, 1,536,683 to British North America, and 1,132,437 to Australia and New zealand in the twenty-five years preceding the formation of the Emigration Board in 1840 the annual average of emigrants was over 39,000. In the subsequent 33 years the average was nearly 200,000. In the.nine years 1846 to 1854 the failure of the potato crop in Ireland and the discovery of gold in California and Australia caused such a rush that the annual average was 286,000.In 1878 the Board noted that the excess of females over males in the United Kingdom was largely due to emigra-tion. This excess in 1871 was 913,000. In the 13 years ending 1875, out of 2,853,000 emigrants, 1,706,000 were males and 1,146,000 females. The Boardlpointed out that in emigration, spontaneous and unassisted by public fands, the disproportion in the sexes must always bo large.Of the numbers above mentioned the Board selected and provided with free and assisted passages, by means of colonial land funds, 352,215 emigrants of ihe labouring classes to Australia, New Zealand, the Cape, Natal and the Falkland Islands. They also specially controlled the emigration to New South Wales, Tasmania and the Cape of 34,376 emigrants selected and shipped by private ship-owners on the bounty system.. An interesting experiment in this period was the eriii-gration to South Africa in 1856-7 of the British German legion, a corps of Germans who had been raised for service with the British in the Crimea, but were not re-quired because of the conclusion of peace. The offer made to these men was that they should be disbanded at the Cape and should agree to remain seven years in the province after being located; they were to receive free rations or an equivalent in money for themselves and their families for one year, 6d. a day for three years, an acre of ground and a building lot in a village, the right of grazing cattle,  18 towards the cost of building a cottage, their arms and camp equipment and the temporary use of tents. 106 officers, 38 wives of officers, 2,245 men, 343 women and 178 children, making in all 2,910 persons, were emigrated on these terms and settled in British Kaffraria. The proportion of women was unduly small, and a number of women were sent out later from England at the expense of Colonial funds. However, the unmarried men continued to be restless, and it was evident that they would never make good settlers. In these circumstances many of them were recruited for war service, and at the end of 1858 there were in British Kaffraria only 1,154 men, women and children connected with, the German legion. These people, however, had proved themselves e* cellent colonists, and the Government were encouraged to obtain over 2,001/ more emigrants from Northern Ger-many who also did well in Kaffraria. The emigrants were recruited in families and were obviously more likely to succeed on that account.   (See page 8 of the report.)Children were first openly emigrated in 1830 by the Society for the Suppression of Juvenile Vagrancy. The London Ragged Schools were the first to send out children in large parties, recruiting them, as a rule, from reforma-tory schools. IJetween 1848 and 1869 the colonies appear to have been anxious to encourage this emigration, but there was a prejudice against it in this country until, in 1888, the Local Government Board prepared a code of regulations, in co-operation with the Canadian Govern-ment, regarding the emigration of pauper children, which has virtually remained unchanged to the present day.At the time when the Emigration Board expired in 1878, it was practically dealing only with coolie immigration to the sugar producing Colonies. All its functions were accordingly absorbed into the Colonial Office, its duties as to shipping and transport being transacted by the Crown Agents for the Colonies.   The main functions of theBoard had disappeared as the various Colonies received responsible government and took over their own Crown Lands. Consequently after 1878, a period ensued during which the Home Government had little or nothing to do with emigration other than the emigration of Indians. The main reason was that this was a period when State inter-ference was anathema, and conditions in the United Kingdom were normal. The people were therefore left to emigrate where and how they pleased, the Government merely providing, by the Passenger Acts ad i mistered by .the Board of Trade, for the security and comfort of the emigrants on board ship.There came, however, about 1884 and 1885, a time of comparative distress in the United Kingdom, and as so often before, emigration was, in various quarters, pointed out as the remedy. It was at the same time urged that assistance would be necessary to enable the persons who were in the greatest need to take advantage of the opportunity-nities overseas, and His Majesty&apos;s Government were urged to vote money for the purpose (see Parliamentary Paper C. 4751, relatng to founding of the Emigration Informa-tion Office).The Government, however, were strongly opposed to any such proposal. The idea of &quot; no state interference &quot; led up to the idea of &quot; no artificial preference for the Colo-nies,&quot; and the fear of granting any subsidy to emigration was the natural result of these ideas. The Government, accordingly, refused to give any State aid to e . igration but consented to the allocation of a small gr.int for an Emigrants&apos; Information Office, to be managed by a volun-tary committee whose sole function should be the col ection and publication of accurate information with regard to the British Colonies which were fields for emigration.In this manner, the State again began to take some part in emigration, but with a view to directing and not to encouraging its flow. Meanwhile, the Self-Governing Colonies had their own agents who were at work in this country recruiting emigrants according to the needs of the Colonies.Further, in the early eighties, the subject of women&apos;s emigration had begun to attract more systematic attention than before, and a numb, r of societies came into existence, notably the British Women&apos;s Emigration Association, which was founded in 1884 under the title c f the United English Women&apos;s Emigration Association., This Associa-tioii selecled emigrants, arranged for their p otection and reception on arrival, kept in touch with them as far as possible and helped necessitous cases with loacs. Several of the other Societies also operated on similar lines.In 1888, as the result of the leport of a Royal Commis-sion on the condition of the Western Highlands and Hebrides, a colonisation scheme for the benefit of the crofters and cottars of the congested districts was agreed to by the Imperial and Canadian Parliaments. A sum of  13,120 was voted by the Imperial Government for the financing of the scheme The settlers who were selected by agents of the Canadian Government, received a free grant of 160 acres of land and an advance of  120 for each family. Two settlements were founded in Manitoba, consisting in all of 79 families, cultivating 4,800 acres of land.- Although after 15 years very few of the original settlers remained on their holdings, it was pointed out at the time that they had all done immeasurably better than they would have done had they remained at home.The Emigrants&apos; Information Office during the 32 years of its existence had done excellent work in the publication of a series of handbooks, pamphlets and circulars, giving authentic and up to-date information regarding conditions in other parts of the Empire and in foreign countries. At the end of 1918, the Committee of management tendered their resignation in view of the proposal to set up an authority with wider powers in connection with emigration problems. There followed, at the beginning of 1919, the establishment of the Oversea Settlement Committee and the course of events since that date is set out in tho body of this Report.
