The following letter on the subject has now boen received from the Chairman of the Commission, General Mance, and is circulated for   information and early decision.(Sd.)   M.P.A.Hankey...... ., .... .^ mmi ixQM. ml i Ml i . ...*.ih.*PH-i  &quot;im&quot;My dear Hankey,In reply to yours 6f the 19th requesting that the speoial Ports,   Waterways aid Railways Commission  in ocmneotion with the Treaty of Peaoe with Turkey should formulate the questions   of policy on whioh a decision is necessary before the Ports, Waterways and Railways clauses ean &quot;be drafted, I. beg to bring the following points to your notice with the ooncurrenoe of my colleagues as a result of our first meeting this morning:-(1)   Certain teahnioal questions affecting the future working of the Hedjaz Railway must await a decision as to the frontier between Syria and Palestine.   Generally speaking the Railway Articles oannot be completed until all the new frontiers are approximately defined.(2)   It is understood that the question of Constantinople and the Straits is being doalt with by a special Commission. The question is evidently one requiring close oo-operation between the Commissions dealing with the political, naval, military, economic and Ports and Waterways questions.-   The Ports and Waterways Commission oannot mako further proposalsuntilNFEfrBNTIAl L,J. - 43t
234until the Politioal and Haval provisions have been   determined.(3)   As regards Smyrna   it will not &quot;be possible to make definite propositions until the questions of sovereignty and administration have been decided.(4)   As regards Batura, an indioation of the future territorial status is necessary in order to draft the clauses regarding the Port.(5)   I shall be glad to know if we are right in assuming , that questi6ns solely affecting future mandatory territory such as the regime of the Ports, Freedom of Transit and International Rivers where Turkey is not affected, will&quot;be . dealt with in separate documents relating to.the mandates and not in the Turkish Treaty.(6)   The- work of the Ports and Y/aterways Commission is largely dependent   on the articles relating to concessions now being ^prepared by the Economic Commission and progress &quot;cannot(be. made on sertain important questions until these articles hare been completed.Our, next meeting will be held at 6 p,m. on Friday by whioh time possibly you can let mo have-  a decision on some   of tiie_.abov.v5 points.In the meanwhile a draft is being prepared of oertain general articles,corresponding to&apos;similar artioles in the other Treaties.Yours sincerely(3d4) H.O,Hanoo&quot;Whitehall Gardens, R.W,V1.25th February, 1920.5.
