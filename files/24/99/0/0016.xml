The policy of the Foreign Office was, however, reversed and action taken without notification being made to the Army Council, who would have been glad of a further opportunity of urging the advisability of complying with Marshal Foch&apos;s proposal.the wae office, 2Zrd February, 1920.WINSTON S. CHUBCHILL.01498072LETTER FBOM THE WAB OFFICE to THE FOBEIGN OFFICE.014-9/8072 (MLR.)the wae office,Sir, . l%th February, 1920.I am commanded by the Army Council again to draw the attention of Earl Curzon of Kedleston to the question of granting permission to the Polish Government to purchase 300,000 rifles from the German Government, as proposed by Marshal Foch,Since despatching their last letter, 0149/8072 (M.I.B.), dated 7th February, on this subject, the attention of the Council has been drawn to Foreign Office telegram No. 1589 P. (Bi.), dated 9th February, to Lord Derby, directing him to maintain his attitude of non-compliance with Marshal Foch&apos;s proposal.The Army Council desire to register formally a protest against the manner in which their recommendations on this subject have been ignored without any notification or warning. In view of Foreign Office letter No. 168117/W./55, dated 15th January, which stated that Earl Curzon of Kedleston saw no reason why His Majesty&apos;s Government should not give its support to Marshal Foch&apos;s proposal, the Council naturally inferred that their views to the same effect, strongly expressed on 13th January and repeated on 27th January (War Office letter 0149/8072 (M.I.B.) of these dates) would be carried out.The Army Council consider that if it had been intended to reverse a policy after they had expressed their agreement, they should have been notified of the fact and given an opportunity of approaching Earl Curzon of Kedleston on the subject again before action was taken.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)  H. J. CBEEDY.The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Foreign Office, S.w. 1.(B20/110)   100  2/20  h&amp;s  797lwo
