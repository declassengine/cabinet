[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1920. .^;:00^IDENTIAL[178716/W/I9]^l- I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet, with reference to my memorandum of 12th February, a further memorandum regarding the advisability of the ratification of the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria and the Treaties with Czecho-Slovakia, Roumania and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State, in addition to the Treaty of Peace with Austria.C. of K.February 25, 1920.Memorandum.The ^consent of the Governments of the Dominions is being secured by the Colonial Office for the ratification by His Majesty the King of the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria. Arrangements are at the same time being pushed forward for the completion of the boundary commissions necessary for carrying out the terms of the Treaty. It has been found that it is possible to include in the same Bill the legislation necessary for giving effect to certain articles in the Austrian and Bulgarian Treaties of Peace. There is, therefore, no reason why the King should not be advised to ratify the Treaty of Peace with Bulgaria as soon as the consent of the Governments of the Dominions has been received.It is also necessary that the &quot; Minorities&quot; Treaties with Czecho-Slovakia, Roumania and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State should be ratified; and the consent of the Governments of the Dominions has been received in both cases.The Austrian,. Czecho-Slovak, Roumanian and Serb-Croat-Slovene Treaties have already been laid before Parliament. The Bulgarian Treaty will, it is hoped, be ready to be laid, next week.The- Austrian Government ratified the Austrian Treaty of Peace soon after signature; and the Bulgarian Government ratified the Treaty of Neuilly on the 27th January. The Italian Government moreover are pressing for the ratifications of the Bulgarian Treaty to be exchanged.It is therefore proposed that the King should be advised to ratify the Austrian, Roumanian, Ozecho-Slovak and Serb-Croat-Slovene Treaties forthwith; and the Bulgarian Treaty as soon as the text has been laid before Parliament and the consent of the Governments of the Dominions has been received.[2419]
