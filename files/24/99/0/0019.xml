(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVBHMICTT),SSCBE T., CP.-719cCABINET,POSITION Off ESTABLISHES DOCKYARDf workmen in-relation&apos;tctsthik^s.Memorandum by the Postmastor-General.(See also CP,644 &amp; CP,688).The First LordTs memorandum (CP.644) raises a question whioh would be of great importance in the event of a strike of the Post Office staff, the majority of whom are established.The principal Trade Unions of Post Offioe servants have recently amalgamated into one body Jen own as the &quot;Union of Post Offioe Workers&quot;.   The Union contemplate adopting what they call a &quot;Strike policy&quot; and establishing a Stride Fund, and it is not impossible that a strike vail some day be attempted either to enforce their own demands or as a measure of sympathy in a serious industrial dispute6I am doubtful.whether in such a contingency a very large proportion of the staff would come out;   probably much would depend on the question at issue, but one of t e principal deterrents would undoubtedly be the prospect of loss of pension.In fact if a strike were imminent, it might be the best policy to threaten dismissal and consequent less of pension, even &quot;though after a settlement some lesser, though neverthe-less severe, penalty were imposed.,But I view with dismay the Admiralty proposal to reinstate the two culprits apparently without penalty. Such a precedent would in my opinion practically amount to a recognition of the right of ail established Civil Servant to place his obligations to his Union before his obligations to the State.     And the fact that the great majority of the Dockyard staff were loyal is an additional reason for making an example of the insignificant minority who were not,I may add that in 1890 an organised strike of London Postmen was attempted and the 450 men who took part were summarily dismissed.     The majority of the established men (about 250 in number) were subsequently reinstated generally some months later, but they forfeited their pay during the interval between dismissal and reinstatement,; in most cases their wages were- substantially rdduaad, and a uniform reduction of 10$ from th^ir pensions has boon consistently enforced, even against men who are now retiring. The penalties imposed upon these men   are widely known throughout the service and I understand that their salutary effect is not yet exhausted.(Signed)     ALBERT H* ILLINGWORTH.CEN5PAL POST OffiTICE, 24th February,&apos; f920.
