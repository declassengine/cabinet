THIS DOCUiuiiKT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANN-IC MAJESTY fS -GOVSuNivIEM.L o G * 21.Public Health (Borrowing Powers) Amendment 31111.S, Amcrandum by the Minister of Health.General powers to borrow, with the sanction of the minister of Health, money for sanitary works (sewers, water-works , street improvements,, cemeteries, hospitals, etc.,) are conferred on local authorities by section 235 of the Public Health Act, 1875, but section 234 provides that the sum borrowed shall not at any time exceed, with the balances of all outstanding loens for sanitary purposes^, the assessable ?value for two yeers of the premises assessable within the district. Many local authorities have obtained Local Acts removing this limitation, and certain general Acts which have applied the Public Health Act borrowing powers to other purposes have expressly provided that the limitation shall not appiy to borrowing for purposes outside the Public Health Act. Indeed it is contrary to modern practice to have any other limitation than tire sanction of the Central Department, The rise in assessable value has not kept pace with the increase in the real money value of property or in the cost of construction of sanitary works, and many cases have come before the Ministry of Health, in which this limita-tion on the total amount which may be borrowed has precluded . the carrying out of necessary sanitary works which the local authority have been quite wi3.1ing to carry out.     The Urban District Councils Association have asked the Minister to promote legislation removing this limitation, and in my opinion this alteration of the law is essential.,    l&quot;he Bill annexed has been drafted with this object,     It does not affect the need of obtaining the sanction of the Minister for every loan.
The occasion has also been taken to obviate the nedessity of a local authority obtaining the sanction of the Minister to re-borrow loans.    At present, in cases where local authorities desire merely a change1 of lender (even though no question of change of period may.be involved), the sanction of the Minister is needed.    Many Acts, both local and general, allow re-borrowing without any sanction.It is also proposed to repeal $ub-section (3) of Section 234 of the Public Health Act, 1875, which precludes the minister from sanctioning any loan without local inquiry if the outstanding loans exceed one year&apos;s (but do not exceed 2 years&apos;) assessable value.   This provision often involves expense and delay, and serves no useful purpose.     If on meritsa local inquiry is desirable, the Minister has full power to direct that a local inquiry shall be held before deciding whether a loan should or should not be sanctioned..Ministry of Health.
