&quot;fUHJO UTILITY 0OMPAM53 (QAPIM ISSUES) BILL.mmoeam by thii m^ims of m mmrn ims^I regret that owing to a mistake this little Bill, reference to the introduction of which was made at the Cabinet Meeting on the 9th February, was aoiualty printed and circulated to the House of Commons before it had received consideration and formal approval by the Home Affairs Committee.The Bill is not one which raises any question of policy or is likely to be in any sense controversial and it is not proposed that it should continue in forco for more than two years..   It is purely a matter of machinery for saving Parliamentary time, and as such was actually suggested to the Board of Trade by the Chairman of :&quot;ays and Means and the Counsel to the Chairman of Committees.Its premature circulation was due to a pure accident.   It has now passed Second Heading in the House of Commons, and unless any of my colleagues .raise objections. I propose that it should be allowed to proceed in Standing Committee as soon as possible,I have already instructed the Board of Trade to consult with the Treasury with a view to agreeing any amendments which that Department may desire to be inserted in Committee, and I understand that the Ministry of Health are now satisfied with the provisions of the Bill,a*0. desire.23rd February, 1920-
