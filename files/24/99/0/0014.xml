COHERENCE ON EVACUATION OF SOUTH RUSSIAN REFUGEES.The Conference considor that the extent of British responsibility is confined to(a) Guarantee of Sir HrMaoJcinder. viz, that women and children of Russian Officers should be evacuated from Novorossisk.(b) Guarantee of Mr Lowden to evacuate refugees from Odessa, vrtiich has already been carried out ao far as possible.Y7ith regard to (a), the Conference recommend that thoso people should be sent to Salonika and Roumania, funds for. their transportation being supplied by Great Britain in view of Sir He Mackinder&apos;s guarantee,     The Allies (including America)-to supply funds for their further support,2.-     It is considered that the Cabinet decision of &apos;29th January 1920 to transfer the wives and children of Russian Officers from Novorossisk to the Crimea cannot be effectively carried out, in view of reports from the C. in Co Mediterranean^ nor is it strictly in accordance with our guarantee.3,-     For the puipose of removing to other countries those persons who wish to go and who have sufficient means to support themselvesf it la considered that a supply of coal and oil should be made to Russian ships.        There are a number of wealthy refugees who can pay their way and it does not seem -?ig&amp; right to deprive them of an opportunity of leaving owing to want of shipping.4.- Russian Medical personnel must be provided to accompany any Refugees evacuated,5,-     The Conference consider that the only practicable method of safeguarding the refugees and others in the Crimea is to impress ca General Denikin that the Crimean peninsula must be held at any costo6.-     It was suggested to the Conference that an enclave &quot;should be formed on the South East Coast of the Crimea under the auspices of the Union of Red Cross Societies, where women,-children, and refugees could be collected, by arrangement with the Bolsheviks;   but the impossibility of ensuring that the Bolsheviks would observe the conditions without an Allied force in occupation, precludes them from recommending it.7.-     Of the various places suggested, to which Refugees could be sent, the on^y practicable ones appear to be Salonika, Roumania, and possibly Lemnos and Cyprus.Pressure might be brought to bear on Greece to permit of a Camp boing formed at Salonika, and the large population ensures sufficient supplies.A Camp could be formed in Cyprus with equipment brought from Egypt or with that at.present in use by 4000 Turkish prisoners who will shortly have to be repatriated.8,-     The Conference further suggest that the Union of Red Cross Societies might be informed of the decisions and asked to organise,9,-     The Conference wish to point out that inasmuch as Great Britain is the PoweS1 which has been supporting denikin against the Bolshevuks, the odium of leaving the Civil Population andVolunteer
Volunteer Arm5.es in the Crimea to their fate, will inevitably fall on the British Government.10c-     With regard to the questions raised by the C-in-CMediterranean, the Conference recommend as follows(A) Will H.M. Gcvernmont authorise evacuation surplus Crimean population and supply co%l and oil to the remainder ?The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative so far as a general evacuation is concerned. With regard to tho second part,  coal and oil sufficient for flour mills, solely as a relief measures should be supplied. The cost to be borne by the Allies.(B) Will HvMo C-Govt. in the event of total collapse (of) Volunteers authorise arrangements for resuming evacuation Army and non-Bolshevik compromised popula-tion South Russia generally ? ,No.     This is not practicable.(C) In either case can H.M..Govt. allocate some place of &apos;asylum for refugees until circumstances enable them.to return, to Russia.     Balkan countries unable to accommodate more than they have now.     It is tentatively suggested Cyprus or Palestine with its numerous and large Russian religious establishments might provide suitable refuge,The answer to this is jfo. The practical diffi-culties render help ok any sufficient scale impossible. The Crimea should he regarded as the asylum for Refugees and held by General DenAkin.ADMIRALTY,80th fdferuary, 1980.
