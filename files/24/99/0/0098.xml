(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE ^OraRTY^OP HIS, BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT&quot;)^ SECRET , CABINET.0 n P.-798*REPARATION AND^THE CLAJMSJ)F^INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS,I circulate correspondence which has passed between Lord Sumner and myself and a memorandum by Sir Warren Fisher..I ask approval for the proposed announcement of policy^4/o/20. , A*C*Chancellor of the exchequer* Under the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the BritishEmpire is entitled to demand the cost of the Army of Occupation and compensation for losses suffered under the following heads j&quot;(a) the cost of pensions to disabled fighting men and to the dependants of fighting men who were-killedo(b) the cost of separation allowances for the dependants of fighting men*(c) damage to civilian life and property caused by legitimate or illegitimate acts of war bythe enemy by S6a; by land or from the air.The cost of the Army of Occupation is a charge on the assets and revenues of the German Empire prior to the cost of repara-ticnj   no relative priority is assigned to the various headsunder which claims for reparation can be made,,2o Certain questions arise in connection with the claims on account of private individuals: losses, on which decisions are required..     The position of private claimants has been(($    carefully considered by Lord Sumner, the Chairman of theLondon Reparation Committee, and his opinion is that theprivate individual has no claim directly on Germany for lossesunder head (c) above,, but that the losses and sufferings of suchindividuals/
Individuals form the subject matter of a claim by the&apos; British Government, as constituting a wrong to the State, and not as private matters or wrongs *    Further, individuals have no claim in law on the British Government for anything it may receive from Germany in respect of such claimsj   the Government is not the individual^ agent to put forward his claim, not his trustee In respect of money received on account of his claim.    Anything granted by the Government to the S\t ferer will thus be entirely as an Act of Grace., and in Lord Sumner&apos;s opinion the interests and claims of the State and the taxpayer at large are preferable and even paramount-3. In support of his opinion Lord Sumner points out&apos;that the origin of the Reparations Commission and, in fact,, of the reparation clauses of the Treaty was simply that no agreement &apos;.could be reached between the Allied Powers as to the minimum aura that the aggregate just claims would amount to, nor as to the maximum sum which Germany could pay.     If agreement could have been reached on these points a lump sum indemnity would have been imposed,, and there would have been no Reparations Commission.     In his view whatever Germany pays under the reparations scheme is in the nature of a general indemnity and not a payment of particular items. 4. There is no doubt whatever that Unless Lord Sumner1view is maintained that any payments by the Government to individuals are ex gratia,we shall be involved in innumerable difficulties and compllcatlsns of the most embarrassing description;   what is more, it will almost certainly be Impossible to deal equitably with private claimants if the Government is forced to accept the alvernatlve view that amounts pesevetfed on aooount of private individuals1 claims are payable to those individuals.    Particularly will this be/
be so in the case of losses of property insured   underthe-G-oTem::;en&apos;b,.,schenes or with private insurance -companies The less to the individual has already been made good to the extent of the amount insured and if he is subsequently given the reparation money in respect of his claim he will be better off than if he had suffered no damage?    similarly the private insurance companies lock the risk voluntarily&apos; and have recouped themselves for the c3alma they have paid by the premiums received from persons who have escaped damage, and there Is no moral reason for paying the reparation moneys to - these.companies .     On the other hand if compensa-   -tion is denied to the man who insured he will claim to be worse off than the man who did not insure and paid no premium but is granted compensation out of the reparation monies. If. once it Is conceded that in the matter of private claims-the Government is merely the agent and trustee for the individual it is quite possible that they might be driven log^eai&quot;..&apos;/ to returning all premiums paid under Government wan risk schemes/   This, in the case of shins and. cargoes alone would be a very serious loss, running into some .  140 ,000.000o     Difficulties would also arise in connection with claims, which the Government either declined to put forward at all.,,, as not being wrtnin the scope of the Treaty (,e(.g,) for loss of profits which might have been expected to accrue but for the war) or which they &quot;fathered&quot; for&apos; a smaller amount than the individual &quot;claimed, whilst cases in which compassionate grants have aireddy been made from public or private funds would present a. series of problems of their own.5. These difficulties would be avoided if the doctrinethat all payments by the Government to the individual are ex gratia,.and it would be possible for the Government, if   -&quot;3.- unfettered/
unfettered by pre-existing rights of individuals,, to preserve a fair equipoise as between the taxpayer on the one hand and the private individuals who have suffered loss on the other hand* -   It is obvious, however, that an announcement that the amount claimed against Germany by the Government on account of the loss suffered by an Individual British national h/is no.necessary relation (except as fixing a maximum) to the amount, if any, Which may eventually be paid out by the Government to that Individual would at once provoke a storm of anxious enquiries from claimants as to the basis on which the Government proposes to award ex gratia payments,, and it seems essential that a decision - even though a provisional one subject to subsequent modification in favour of the individual - should be arrived at before any announcement on the subject is made. 6o Lord oumner has been consulted on this point, andhis view is that the best solution is &quot;to say that all payments are ex gratia only:   that a Commission will be set up in the fulness of time to advise on each case;   and that In the meantime people will be paid any costs they Incur in collecting particulars and proofs for the Government to submit&quot;,I am strongly in favour of maintaining the ex gratia doctrine, and I can see no objection to the proposed Commission provided the right will not be given to claimants to argue th^ir cases before the Commission in person..    The Commission should be empowered to consider either written or oral evidence in any case in which, they thought it desirable., but if the right were given to people to argue their claims with the Commission the work would never be finished..    It should be understood.that this Commission would have no voice in the formulation of the Government claim against Germany.This/
This work would remain with Lord Sumner&apos;s Committee and the proposed Commission would be solely concerned with the award of compensation to individuals out of the reparation money received from Germanyn     As regards payment of costs incurred in collecting particulars etc. I think it would be better omitteda     Evidence could be required to be given in support of the claims by statutory declaration on which the stamp duty Could be remitted, so that the only out-of-pocket expense in respect of the declaration would be the Commissioner^ fee, which is very small.     If we announce that we are going to pay the costs incurred in collecting particulars and proofs, I can imagine very substantial bills of solicitors, accountants, actuaries, quantity surveyors, architects, etc. being sent in to be paid by the Government and it will he impossible to resist paying these accounts on the ground that the expense Incurred was unnecessary.7* Whilst i.am in accord with the above suggestions made by Lord Sumner, I feel that the Government will be subject to very great pressure to go further in the direction of a more definite pronouncement of their intentions toward the private claimant a     It will not satisfy these individuals to be told that they have no legal rights but that the Government will In due course consider, by means of the proposed Commission, whether any payment, and If so what amount, shall be made to them as an act of grace:   and In view of the fact that reparation payments may be spread over 30 years the time of payment to individuals is a matter of greatest importance to them.     Already, for example, requests have been put forward by the Margate and Ramsgate Town Councils for payments to them in anticipation of receipts from Germany on account of the losses to which their citizens have been subject through Germany&apos;s aggression.&quot;5** 8 n/
Qo     In order to consider what night reasonably be done for private individuals it is &quot;ssenilal to get an idea oven though a rough one - of tho relative magnitude of the various classes of claims which will be presented to Germany b;. tho Reparations Commissions    The statistics arc by no moans complete 7 as yct;, and any figures must bo in the natur of speculations given with the greatest reserve0    Subject to this unders/banding the following rough forecasts will probably be sufficiently accurate for the present purposemillion  Total Allied claims? 8,000Total claims In respect of British and Dominion Government losses (Armies of Occupation, PensionsP Separation Allowances,, Ships, etca) 2,500Total claims in respect of BritishnationalsJ individual losseSe 2590     Even If the British national had an unquestioned -legal claim to the whole amount recovered from. Germany In respect of his loss, the satisfaction of his claim in full would depend cn Germany eventually paying the whole amount of the estimated 85OO0 million   claims;   and the claimant would only be entitled to yearly dividends spread over the whole period of 50 yearse     If, for instance, Germany only paid 2;00C million   (i0o* a quarter of the assumed total claim against her) the British Empire would only ret 625 millions in respect of their claims for 2,500 millions,, and the British private claims would similarly rank for only a quarter of their nominal valueo     Thus the claimant for, say?  400 would eventually get  100 in 30 more or less equal instalments of about  3c     Special machinery for effecting these payments would of course have to be kept in force for tho whole period of 30 years0&apos;  &apos; 10/j
10,    The admission then that the private Individual was entitled to rank on equal terms with the State as though both were creditors in a liquidation would afford little satisfaction to the individual and would obviously be un-workable in practice, and in my view the solution is to be found in a compromise on the following lines:-(1)   No legal claim by private individuals against the reparation monies to be admitted, but any payments made to them to be as an Act of Grace on -the part of the Government, (2)   A lump sumP of say,,  5.000,000 to be set aside out of the first receipts of reparation monies allocated to the Exchequer of the United Kingdom (after payment of the cost of the Armies of Occupation) to create a fund out of which payments will be made to Individuals who have a moral claim to compensation, (3)   A Commission to be appointed to examine claims and to make awards out of this fund, proceeding on the basis of the strength of the. claim rather than on the amount.for which it was admitted by the Reparation Commissions,110    A3 regards tho amount of this fund, I would suggest that, in the first instance at any rate, it should not be more than  5,000^000,,     The rough forecast of the total private claims is five times this amount, but undoubtedly this will include a large block which would not fall within the category of &quot;moral claims&quot;j   and in any event the payment of an average dividend of 4/- in, the   at once (regardless of whether the assets will eventually allow of all creditors receiving a.&apos;  &apos; dividend/
dividend of that amount) in place of a questionably larger, . and possibly smaller, amount spread over 30 years could very well be claimed as an equitable, and even generous, arrangement. 12. It should be added that the Law Officers have notbeen consulted as to whether they agree with Lord Sumner-s opinion (para. 2 above) of the legal position, and I think it is probably better at this staje not to consult them. If they were to agree with Lord Sumner it would, not help politically in meeting the protests of persons who have suffered loss for which they assume they.have a right to reparation, while if they disagreed with Lord. Sumner very great embarrassment would result.     Mr. Payne, Secretary of the Board of Trade, with whom I have discussed the matter, would, however, prefer to get the opinion of the Law&apos;Officers, as he thinks an awkward position would be created if Lord Sumner&apos;s opinion was over-ruled in the Courts after a lar^e part ofthe proposed fund of  5,000,000 had been distributed to individuals on the strength of their moral claims.13. It must hot be overlooked that India and theDominions will be interested in the decision given in thismatter, as they may feel bound to follow suit; . but theirprivate claims will probably be such a. small proportion oftheir total claim as to be almost negligible,N. P. W. P.2. 3o 1920.
Private. 25/ Gloucester-Square,Hyde Park,   f, 2,25 January, 1920,My dear Chancellor of the.Exchequer,I am much obliged for your letter of the 22nd, If it is not possible, as I had hoped it would be, tc defer any deciaicn as to grants to individuals at least till there is some money to divide^ the next best thing is tc prepare for the decision as carefully as we can, and, With the help of the Committee with which I am working, I am ready ts do what I can,,I hope that at any rate nothing will be done till the whole field ef ftur probable claims has been generally surveyed.     To deal with the matter without taking the whole of it into consideration would lead to much harm, and, If a decision were arrived at merely on hard (or hardy) cases like the one you mention, I think it would be regretted afterwards.My reason is this.     The cases, in which individualhardship, still unredressed, could be pui forward as the basiscf a recognition that in principle, money recovered is recoveredfor the sufferer, are in the aggregate small in comparisonwith oases, in which the less has been made g$od mere or lessfully;   and yet, if such a principle is recognised at all, itwill be difficult to refuse its recognition generally.     Tosay &quot;the case seems a hard one;   the amount is small;   by all means concede it&quot; is a natural and probable exclusion, if the matter is taken up on such a case as the Margate case, but, if that is once done, what Is the answer,, when the shipowners andthe consignees of cargo (other than Government Departments) make/the
the same claim?        In so far as they were covered by private underwriters the latter will claim to stand in the shoes of the assured.        In so far as the Government under-wrote them and paid the losses, it will be said that the Government charged premiums, which gave it a handsome profit, and that to keep the sums recovered from the Germans is gigantic profiteering;   that an uninsured shipowner should, be nc worse off than a Scarborough lodging-house keeper, and if an insured owner is to be placed in.a different position, he will be penalised because he came into the insurance scheme, to which the Government invited him.      Shipowners are powerful but not popular     If their claim is resisted they will make a rewj    if it is conceded, the next thing will be a demand that sums received in respect of pensions shall be spent in increasing pensions - illogical no doubt, but what is the good of saying that nowadays?I still think that the best way of getting rOund the difficulties is to say, that all payments are ex gratia only; that a commission will be set up in the fulness of time to advise on each case;   and that in the meantime people will be paid any costs they incur in collecting particulars and proofs for the Government to submit.     If that is not good enough for them, their cases had better be dropped.     In any case, if the bulk of any money we ever get goes to individuals and not to paying off debt, all my interest in Reparation is gone, and I begin to doubt&apos; if it might not be wiser to drop it.Do you not think it is about.time that the Government should officially defend the Treaty, and try to dispel the calumny and misunderstandings, that are fast making the public condemn the whole thing by default?     There really is quite a good case for it, but it will soon be too late to state it.Believe me,Yours sincerely, (Signed)        SUMNER.
TREASURY CHAMBERS,    S.F.1 22nd January, 1920,Dear Lord Sumner,I have read with much interest your letter of the 9th January to Sir Farren -Fisher regarding the position of -private persons who have suffered loss or injury of such a nature as to give rise to a claim against Germany under the reparation clauses of the Treaty,The conclusion at which, you have arrived that not only have the individuals concerned no right of access to the Reparation Commission direct; &quot;but that they have moreover no legal title to all or any part of the compensation that may be obtained by the Government by reason of the damage to the individuals is clearly of the greatest importance, and I propose to bring it to the notice of the Cabinet,There can however be no doubt that an individual in respect of vhose damage a claim is admissible under the Treaty imagines when he puts it forward that any compensation re-ceived by the Government in respect of his particular claim will be paid over to him-     If we announce&quot; as you suggest, that private individuals have no right of compensation, and that any payments to them by the Government out of the repara-tion monies received from Germany are made ex-gratia there will be a universal demand on the part of claimants for a statement of the Government1s intentions in the matter, and I doubt whether it would in practice be possible for the Government to keep silence *     Indeed, I am not sure that we should not be open to the charge of breach of faith in inviting people to put forward claims - very often at some expense and trouble to themselves - if we subsequently took up the position that any compensation received in respect of their claims was regarded as Compensation for a loss to the State, as distinct from the individual, and that the proceeds would accordingly go to the benefit of the State and not the individual.,We have already a concrete case in point.     The/Margate
Margate Town Council have presented claims for damagesustained by residents - much of it probably inadmissibleunder the terms of the Treaty - and they so confidentlyassume that anything recovered in respect of their claimwill be handed over to them, that they ask for an advance*n account out of the profits made out of the ^&apos;;ar RisksInsurance Scheme..,..I fear therefore that we are already up against&quot;the stile&quot; and. must decide ho^ we are to take it;     atleast we must investigate alternatives and be prepared witha policy if required.     I should therefore he most grateful if you would convene a small subcommitteewith a view to considering the best course to adopt if the Government have to make, some provision out of receipts for Reparation for the satisfaction of the demands of individuals or piblic authorities who have hitherto received inadequate compensation or none at all.As to membership of the Committee, you would be the best judge, and I should gladly leave the choice to you, but to show you the sort of thing that is in my mind I may say that the names of Mr. Payne of the Board of Trade and Mr. Pass of the Treasury had occurred to me as suitable.Yours sincerely, (Signed)     AUSTKK CHAMBERLAIN,The Right Hon.The Lord Sumner
