250follows to the Foreign Office :-&quot;I desire to draw your attention to the fact that there has latterly been noticeable military liveliness in the provinces, especially amongst the Nationalists, and the situation shows signs of tension.   There has been of course not time as yet for my communication to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Turkey will not lose Constantinople to become generally known in the provinces and, though I anticipate that it will produce a sedative effect, I fell that we should have sufficient military strength locally to render impossible any action against us by the Nationalists similar to the attack on the French in   Cilicia. To this end I consider reinforcements of Allied battleships desirable.&quot;BLACK   SEA * -The further withdrawal of troops from Batoum has been stopped^   Supreme Council have decided that Batoicn shall be garrisoned by an International Force of one British, one French and one Italian battalion, all under the command of General Milne.No coal remains at Sevastopol, and there is great Congestion in all towns-eFrom Novorosslsk reports have been received that Kuban Cossacks have apparently revolted.Denikin is believed to be withdrawing all British Military Mission to Novorossisk.Rear-Admiral 2nd in Command has sent an urgent request for ships to be sent at once to evacuate 21,000 persons.Commander-in-Chief has told Rear-Admiral to take all measures, Including landing, until the situation clears and the intentions of the Kubans are known.Refugees *The Commander-In-Chief, Mediterranean^has received the following Admiralty instructions in continuation of those previously sent :-&quot;The evacuation to Salonika and Roumania of the women and children of Russian,  Officers has been authorised by H.M.
