General : The Peace Treaties and the Ministry of Labour.The position of the Ministry of Labour, as well as certain other Departments, in regard to international affairs may be affected by the clauses in the Peace Treaties which contain what is now known as the Labour Charter, and it may be desirable, therefore, to point out some of the possibilities to which these clauses give rise. Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles and corresponding parts of the other Treaties contain the following clause :-(Article 397) &quot; The Government Departments of any of the Members which deal with questions of industry and employment may communicate directly with the Director through the Representative of.their Government on the Governing Body of the Inter-national Labour Office, or, failing any such Representative, through such other qualified official as the Government may nominate for the purpose.&quot;This clearly indicates a direct connection between the Ministry of Labour and any other Departments concerned and the International Labour Office, and provides for some kind of representative at the seat of the League, not necessarily in residence there, but specifically commissioned for intercourse on questions of industry and employment.(c 19(50)  150  2/20  h &amp; s 0
Certain new duties also appear to be placed upon the Ministry of Labour by the Treaties. For example, the presenting of draft bills arising out of International Labour Conventions is obligatory under Article 405. In the case of the Recommendations of the International Labour Conference, the Government is bound under the same Article to &quot;inform the Secretary-General of the League of the action taken.&quot; Finally, under Article 408 :- &apos;&quot; Each of the Members agrees to make an annual report to the International Labour Office on the measures which it has taken to give effect to the provisions of conventions to which it is a party.&quot;At the Washington Conference a number of Conventions and Recommendations were agreed to, and the International Labour Office has now been established in London, pending its transference to the Seat of the League of Nations. It is under the control of a Governing Body containing representatives of employers and workers, as well as of Governments.  It may, therefore, be desirable to review the situation thus created.In the first place, the Departments concerned, and especially the Ministry of Labour, assume an international function. It is of great importance to distinguish international policy from &quot; foreign policy,&quot; for while the former is the pursuit of a common interest, the latter the pursuit of separable, distinct and sometimes conflicting interests. The Ministry of Labour under the Peace Treaties would not be concerned with foreign policy, for which there is a traditional machinery ; but it may have to review international affairs from a new point of view. The result in practice is that it is not apposite to international policy simply to follow the peculiar habits and customs of &quot; foreigners &quot; ; mere information as to foreign countries is no basis for international policy. There must be some method (1) for reviewing labour problems, not under the head of countries, but of subjects, and, secondly, (2) for devising policy in regard, for example, to international services, such as shipping, or international issues, such as unemployment arising out of fluctuations in trade, which involve &quot; international&quot; policy in dealing with issues in regard to which frontiers are irrelevant.So far as information goes, it appears that the Ministry of Labour will need to make a special study of international labour problems. These problems arise out of the inter-national organisation of supply and the fact that the markets of the world are inter-national. They are not the problems reported upon by diplomatic or even commercial agents, because these are representatives, so to speak, of separate and distinguishable if not conflicting national interests. It may be noted in passing that the growth of inter-national Trade Union and Socialist movements is driving the Ministry in this direction already.In regard to policy the same considerations are applicable. Industrial policy in regard to international services will have to be based upon an international point of view. The attempt to reach a policy for Great Britain by mere conflict or barter with other nations cannot be successful, for the issues involved are not susceptible of solution on purely national grounds. To take an obvious example, the conditions of employment of labour on British ships must eventually be based upon some international standard exactly as the &quot; rule of the sea,&quot; the laws of salvage and other matters are now based upon international agreements. The field in which international agreements are necessary is extending because of the closer integration of economic organisations ; and therefore, the devising of industrial policy from an international point of view will become increas-ingly important.In the second place the Ministry of Labour will be internationally in touch with an organisation in which the &quot;functional&quot; has displaced the &quot; regional&quot; as the basis of action. Both the Conference and the Governing Body are not simply representative of sovereign states but, at least in part, of industrial groups. These industrial groups are therefore partly the sources of the conventions which the Ministries of Labour among other Depart-ments are committed to promote in the form of legislation. The agreed Conventions are thus similar to agreements made by the Industrial Conferences which, have been the bases for the new Bills now before the House of Commons. The point of importance is that the method of industrial legislation is changing; and if the Governing Body eventually initiates industrial as contrasted with political action, we shall have in the international sphere a new kind of administration. The effects upon the various industrial organisations in the United Kingdom of the contact and possible common policy promoted by inter-national conferences and committees may be of the utmost importance to the departments concerned. It is certain that connections were formed at Washington which are likely to develop both on the workers&apos; and on the employers&apos; side. The industrial policy of such groups may increasingly be based upon international reasons and if Conventions are carried at the International Labour Conferences, the several non-governmental groups;
Part II. Departmental.Juvenile Employment.In dealing, through the Juvenile Employment Exchanges and Juvenile Advisory Committees, with the employment of workers under the age of 18, the activities of the Ministry are now affected by the Education Act of 1918. On the whole, experience of the retention of children reaching the age of 14 in school until the end of the school term shows distinct advantages even from the point of view of employment. Hitherto the children have left school in small numbers throughout the whole year. It was difficult to make satisfactory arrangements for interview and advice by the Juvenile Advisory Committees, and the prospects of employment depended largely on the vacancies which happened at the moment to be available at the Juvenile Exchange. Under the new arrangements, where boys or girls leave school in a group, it is easier to make arrangements to deal with the situation. The work of the Juvenile Employment Committees is facilitated; arrangements can be made with much more readiness to bring employers into touch with prospective workers while the boys and girls are still at school, and by holding over vacancies until a fresh group of children become available the new workers, can be placed with more readiness in positions for which their capacity fits them. The weak point hitherto may be said to lie in the fact that employers have not yet become accustomed to the new arrangements. Some degree of business readjustment is necessary if vacancies are- to be available in quantity at those seasons when new workers are also available in quantity. This difficulty, however, is one which time is almost certain to remove. Already the exchanges in the London area have been enabled by employers to hold over vacancies until the end of the term, when suitable candidates were likely to present themselves.The resumption and development of after-care work which has been a featurevof the work of Juvenile Employment Committees since the Armistice still continues, and the activities of the department for the development of apprenticeship schemes, whether locally through the activities of the Juvenile Advisory Committees or centrally by negotiation with Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Eeconstruction Committees, continue to bear fruit. As an example of what has been accomplished in the latter direction, the work of the Bristol Local Advisory Committee may be cited. During 1919 the Committee have succeeded in drawing up local schemes of apprenticeship for the building, engineering, boot and shoe making, watch and clock making, furniture, and dressmaking and millinery trades. They are now proposing to take similar steps in connection with baking and confectionery, shipbuilding, wholesale tailoring, bespoke tailoring, and coach and motor-body building. The Juvenile Employment Committees, so far as possible, are steadily directing juvenile workers towards apprenticeship to some skilled trade. Despite the financial attraction of many kinds of semi-skilled or unskilled , employment, these efforts have in many cases met with much success.Public attention has been directed to one of. the problems of organisation connected with juvenile employment by a letter in &quot; The Times &quot; signed among others by Lord Henry Bentinck, who has recently raised the question again in the House of Commons. The point at issue arises over the relations between the Board of Education and the Ministry of Labour in the establishment of Juvenile Employment Committees, and the suggestion is offered that to prevent overlapping of activities, the responsibility both for Juvenile Exchanges and for Juvenile Employment Committees should rest with one or other of the departments. This question of organisation had, however,, already been under discus-sion between the departments for some time. The present situation is regulated by a Joint Memorandum issued in 1911, which rests in the main on a distinction between the giving of advice as to the selection of occupations and the practical task of registering applicants for employment and bringing them into touch with employers with notified vacancies of the kind desired.  The memorandum suggests that the first of these functionsthere represented may use pressure by agreement upon their Governments to pass the necessary legislation.The Ministry of Labour, then, under the Peace Treaties becomes part of the international organisation of governments in their relation to industry and employment. In proportion as the International Labour Office and the unofficial international labour organisations become more active the Ministry of Labour will be inevitably drawn more and more into international affairs.
should rest with the Choice of Employment Committees set up by the Local Education Authorities under the Education (Choice of Employment) Act, 1910, with the assistance of information as to the conditions and prospects of employment provided by the Employ-ment Exchanges. As regards the second of these tasks, namely, the registration of ;.applicants and their selection to fill vacancies notified by employers, it is considered . that the duites belong primarily to the officers of the Ministry of Labour. It has not always been easy for the Ministry of Labour to approve of the arrangements suggested by local education authorities under this scheme of compromise, and in certain areas this situation has led, in accordance with a ruling of the Cabinet, to the establishment by the Ministry of Juvenile Advisory Committees side by side with Choice of Employment Com-mittees approved by the Board of Education. It is none the less true that in most cases where Choice of Employment Committees have been set up by Local Education Authorities, co-operation has not proved imduly difficult. The attitude of local education authorities, however, as expressed at a conference in March, 1919, has been that in view of their duties . under the Education Act of 1919, it was essential that, while availing themselves, of the co-operation of the Employment Exchanges, they should maintain paramount influence and executive control in carrying into effect, on their own premises and with their own staff, the provisions of the Education (Choice of Employment) Act. The effect of such a scheme, if adopted, would have been to multiply juvenile employment agencies under the Choice of Education Schemes as distinct from the Juvenile Exchanges established under the Labour Exchange Acts, and to restrict the functions of the Ministry in their working to the supply of information as to industrial conditions and vacancies for juvenile workers.Part TIL The Labour and Socialist Press.Foreign Affairs.The publication of the Notes* addressed by the Supreme Council to the German and Netherlands Governments with reference to the carrying out of Part VII of the Treaty of Peace would seem to have quieted the discussion which the rumoured difficulties of the Supreme Council in this matter was beginning to arouse. The analysis of Anglo-French difficulties which was such a notable feature of last week&apos;s &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; New States-man,&quot; has attracted Mr. Philip Snowden, who insists, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; that the people of this country will not be used as the tools of French policy. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; concludes that the Peace Treaty is crumbling and that the Supreme Council have been forced to make a complete surrender in these matters. This surrender, thinks the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; has been an act of wisdom, and the hope is expressed that the Allied Governments in the future will admit other faults of the Treaty as frankly. The discussion on &quot; war criminals&quot; has at last received the attention of &quot; The Call,&quot; which, paper devotes a full page to arraigning those trade union officials who took part in the proceedings of military service tribunals in England, or who urged their members to enlist as volunteers in the earlier part of the Avar, or who took office in the Government. These men, together with the leaders of the Second International, are, in the opinion of this paper, tainted with &quot; war crime &quot; as deeply as any German. Mr. A. M. Thompson in the &quot; Clarion &quot; reviews all the topics which are being discussed by the Allied Conference, and attacks the Allied Governments for &quot; wobbling.&quot; The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; continues to devote its attention to questions of allied relations with Eussia and gathers together a catalogue of rumours to show that a great spring offensive is being prepared by the Allies in Germany against the Soviet Government. In this connection it may be noted that Prof. W. T. Goode&apos;s recent bookf on Eussia is reviewed in many of these papers. Prof. Goode&apos;s series -of lectures on his experiences in Russia appear to have been responsible for a considerable change in the attitude of the I.L.P. papers, and such papers as the &quot;New Statesman&quot; towards the Soviet rule. The publication of this book will subject his observations to the destructive analysis of the anti-Bolshevist papers, and his influence it may be antici-pated, will now begin to wane.   &quot;Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; is greatly concerned with* The notes were printed in &quot;The Times&quot; of the 17th inst. f &quot;Bolshevism at Work.&quot;
the Adriatic question, and the &quot;New Statesman &quot; discusses the question of Constan-tinople. This paper sees no reason why the Turks should be expelled from, and many reasons why they should be allowed to stay in, Constantinople. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; favourably notices the London meeting of the Council of the League of Nations.        . ,The Labour Movement.The Prime Ministers speeches in the first week of the Parliamentary session are reviewed in the &quot;Nation,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; and by Mr. Philip Snowden in the: &quot;Labour Leader.&quot;   The conclusion is arrived at that the Prime Minister is making all; preparations for an electioneering attack upon the Labour Party.   In this campaign they believe that the two main charges brought against the Labour Party and the Trade. Unions will be that they are responsible for the housing shortage, owing to their hostility to dilution, and that they are responsible for the unemployment among discharged and disabled men, owing to their hesitation to admit trainees to the ranks of skilled labour. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is at pains to refute these charges in some detail.   The Ashton&apos; by-election is not noticed except in the I.L.P. papers, which are not displeased at the result.*   Mr. W. C. Eobinson, the Labour candidate at Ashton, is described as a safe, moderate and ordinary trade union candidate.   The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; points out that, he was careful to say that he was not a Socialist.   His failure is compared with the success of Mr. Myers in the Spen Valley division in order to prove how necessary the support of I.L.P. headquarters is to Labour candidates in by-elections.   In &quot; Forward,&quot; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald thinks that the Parliamentary Labour Party has by its conduct in the last session held itself peculiarly open to attack, and concludes that Mr. Asquith&apos;s return for Paisley will still further weaken its position in the House of Commons.   &quot; Rob Roy &quot; writes in this paper in the belief that Sir. Asquith would be returned, and states that one of the main points made against Mr. Biggar at Paisley was the ineffectiveness of Labour members in Parliament.   He complains that absurd demands are made upon Labour members by their.local organisations.  Labour members, he points out, have little time to ponder the problems of statesmanship, owing to the fact that they are expected to give up all their spare time to the conducting of propaganda meetings.The more extreme papers are now pre-occupied with the relations of the more extreme organisations to each other, to the Labour Party, and to the Third International.   &quot; The Call &quot; is attacking the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation and the Socialist Labour Party for being intransigeant.   In the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; Miss Sylvia Pankhurst reviews the whole situation. The Labour Party is criticised for its social patriotism.   The policies of the &quot;Reformist&quot; and the &quot;Revolutionary &quot; parties are carefully distinguished. It is declared that the revolutionary parties which, Miss Pankhurst states, will, where possible, describe themselves as Communist as distinguished from Socialist, will never again take part, in an International which includes Reformists.   The evidence is accumulating that the I.L.P.&apos;s hope for an International which may include all European Socialists, and in which the I.L.P. may occupy a balancing position, will never be realised.   Mr. Snowden&apos;sr remarks, noted last week,f would seem to show nevertheless that the I.L.P. leaders still cling to this idea.  The British Socialist Party is called upon by Miss Pankhurst to make its choice between the two groups of parties, and it is suggested that many have been the opportunities in the last two years when that choice could have been made.  Mr. W. Gallacher (of the &quot; Scottish Workers&apos; Council &quot;) voices a demand in this paper for a sound revolutionary industrial organisation, declares that the British Socialist Party does not count as an effective body in the Glasgow area, and insists that Communists must avoid any connection at all with &quot; Parliamentarism.&quot;Mines Nationalisation.The mines nationalisation question has been of interest as to Labour and Socialist Press not only on account of the fact that it has provided an occasion for the discussion of the general principles of nationalisation, but also because there has been entangled with it the Avhole question of industrial action for political purposes. The discussion on the ethics of nationalisation was quickly exhausted in these papers, and there are now signs that the relation between the mines nationalisation question and the question of direct action are undergoing a decisive change. The more extreme papers have come to. believe that the Sankey scheme is not worth an experiment in direct action, while the papers which remain convinced supporters of nationalisation are just those papers which;* Declared on the 13th inst. f Of. Keport, 18th inst., p. 88.
disapprove of direct action. Though the debate in the House of Commons on-. February 11th therefore receives attention in this press, the comments made are not re-markable for their importance and the discussion revolves round side issues. Mr. Philip Snowden and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald express the opinion that it was hardly good tactics for the Parliamentary Labour Party to raise this subject by an amendment to the Address. They both think that the Government would like the Trades Union Congress to declare for direct action on this issue, and are therefore all the more insistent that the question of mines nationalisation must be kept within the political sphere. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald complains that the services of the purely political part of the Labour movement, by which he means the I.L.P., have not been properly utilised in the mines nationalisation campaign.. The &quot; New Statesman&quot; thinks it necessary,after eight months of agitation on this question,, to outline for the benefit of its readers the main features of the Sankey scheme and of the nationalisation plan formulated by the M.F.G.B. The opinion of &quot; Justice,&quot; that the Government is preparing for a judicious surrender behind, the scenes, may be compared with the opinion expressed by the &quot; Socialist&quot; last week, that the miners&apos; leaders, too, are meditating a retreat from their position. These two opinions taken together show the growing strength of the belief that no national crisis will occur on this question. The New Age &quot; continues to be severely critical of the nationalisation scheme, and the &quot; Socialist &quot; gives a series of quotations from Mr. Brace&apos;s speech on the 11th inst. to show. that the miners&apos; leaders are betraying their followers. Mr. W. Mackinder&apos;s allegations with regard to the profits made in worsted yarn manufacture were the occasion of some suggestions for the nationalisation of the wool trade, and the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; this week bases upon the recently issued report, by a sub-committee of the Standing Committee on Trusts, on combines in the sewing cotton manufacture, a demand for the nationalisation of this trade. In this connection it is interesting to note that the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; discusses a lecture by Mr. R. H. Tawney in Manchester on the control of industry, and displays no desire at all for any nationalisation agitation in the cotton textile industry.Government Policy.The discussions on the housing question are the occasion for many attacks upon. Government policy. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; criticises the Ministry of Health for the many delays in the putting into operation of housing schemes which have been caused by the official revisions of local authorities&apos; proposals. It is maintained that these delays have given full opportunity for the providers of building materials to reap excess profits. Mr. J. Wheatley, in &quot;Forward,&quot; describes his experiences at the conference between repre-sentatives of local housing authorities and the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet on the 13th inst. Mr. Wheatley concludes that there is a definite Govern-ment policy in this matter to increase rents, increase interest charges, support trusts, and. blame the trade unions for delays. Mr. H. B. Lees Smith, in the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; outlines the financial proposals which a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer would have: to make. He suggests that a Labour Chancellor would have to remit sixty millions taxation on such things as sugar, tea, and income tax on small incomes. On the other hand a Labour Government would need to spend an additional sum of  200,000,000 per annum on the civil services. Mr. Lees Smith then makes a series of suggestions to show how this deficit might be covered. He would tax titles, advertisements, land values, and would obtain seventy millons from the liquor trade without increasing any prices. He would substitute for the excess profits tax a general profits tax which would increase as the percentage of profit increased. This principle of graduation he would extend to the house duties, and to establishment duties. As a result of a series of guesses as to the amount of increased revenue which would be raised by such measures as these, he is compelled to arrive at the conclusion that only by the extinction of the greater part of the national debt by a levy on capital would a Labour Government be able to balance the national income and expendi-ture. An anonymous correspondent to &quot; Justice &quot; outlines a scheme by which the Government might provide for the shortage&quot;of houses. The scheme is complex and im-praoticable, but one point in it may be noted : the proposal is that the cost of erecting houses should be covered by issues of Treasury notes. The proposal, which has emanated from Wigan, to provide for all local reconstruction expenditure by the issue of further currency notes has been seized upon by many people as a sovereign remedy for financial difficulties. Mr. J. Wheatley advocates the establishment of a note issuing Scotch Bank owned and controlled by local authorities in order to provide for housing expenditure. Another correspondent to &quot; Forward &quot; casually mentions the issue of &quot; non-interest bearing bonds.&quot; The popular expressions of economists as to the real meaning of the issue of Treasury notes have been taken, apparently, by mawy people to be an exact description of the process by which currency notes have been created, and the argument is frequently
Part IV.  General Topics.The General Situation.The general labour situation continues to be dominated by the question of the national-isation of the mines. Arrangements, mentioned in detail below, have been made by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain for the holding of a special Congress to consider &quot; the form of action &quot; to be taken to secure the nationalisation of the mines. The general tendency &apos; against any form of unconstitutional action continues to become more marked. In the Houses of Parliament labour matters have been a centre of interest. The second reading of the Unemployment Insurance Bill was taken on the&apos; 25th February; and important debates took place in both Houses, on the 18th February in the lower house on Capt. Hambro&apos;s resolution with regard to the attitude of trade unions to ex-Service men, and on the 24th February in the House of Lords on the Earl of Selborne&apos;s motion with reference to the policy of the Government in- its negotiations with Labour. ^* Of. Eeport, 11th inst., p. 73.t Cf. Report, 4th inst., p. 62.put forward that currency notes secured against material value will have, none of the ill&quot; effects of the present issue, which these writers regard as totally unsecured. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; contains another criticism of employment exchanges. It is insisted that employers and trade unions could do the work of the Exchanges more effectively, more cheaply, and more efficiently. Mr. A. M. Thompson, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; suggests that the Minister of Labour should set up a Court of Enquiry under the Industrial Courts Act to enquire into the question of coal miners&apos; wages in relation to the profits of the industry.Prices and Profiteering.Mr. J. Terrett describes in the &quot; British Citizen &quot; his experiences at a meeting of the central profiteering tribunal. He complains that the hesitation which retailers show in bringing charges against wholesalers is rendering the penal provisions of the Profiteering Act nugatory. Mr. Terrett&apos;s suggestion is that, when a local tribunal discovers that the real cause of an exorbitant price is the wholesale price rather than the retailer&apos;s profiteering, the power to prosecute the wholesaler should devolve upon an official of the Complaints Committee. He also suggests the central body under the Profiteering Act should have power to appoint profiteering inspectors. The &quot; New Age &quot; rehearses its arguments that increased production under the present system can be no remedy for high prices. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; bases upon statements made by the Prime Minister and by Sir Alfred Booth the conclusion that the Government and the capitalists are guilty of a conspiracy in this matter. The capitalist is compelled to increase his wages, and then the Government &quot;prints more currency notes&quot; to defeat the higher wages. The &quot;Socialist &quot; reviews the whole national and international financial position from the cold, detached and pseudo-scientific point of view of the &quot; Marxian analysis,&quot; and joyfully concludes that &quot; capitalism is tottering on its international legs.&quot;Wages and the Cost of Living.Mr. E. Edwards continues in the &quot; Railway Keview &quot; the discussion upon the sliding scale clause which was incorporated in the agreement between the N.U.R. and the Ministry , of Transport. He does not strictly confine himself in his desultory essay to the sliding cscale part of the agreement but is suspicious of the whole settlement. &quot; standardisation-tion,&quot; &quot;stabilisation,&quot; and &quot;sliding scale&quot; are to him ominous terms which cannot find favour with those who believe in the class-war. He thinks the new agreement is less favourable than the temporary arrangement agreed upon in March, 1919. &quot; Either the railwaymen were robbed of the increased war-wage to which they would have been entitled under the old arrangement, or else of the back pay to August which standardisation pro-promised.&quot; Mr. Edwards&apos; point of view is similar to that of Messrs. Mainwaring &amp; Craik,* and he voices the general complaints at the railway settlement at which the leaders of the Central Labour College hinted, but which they were careful not to formulate, in the official organ of the N.U.R. In a leading article in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; an answer is made to some criticisms passed by the &quot; New Age &quot; on the sliding scale, and in defence of the sliding scale Mr. C. T. Cramp&apos;s arguments! are recapitulated at greater length. It is insisted that the agreement provides machinei^ whereby the basis of the sliding scale can be amended and improved. $
Survey of Industrial Demands and Disputes.A notable feature of the week has been the Very large number of important demands for wage advances which have been made. Among the claims presented are those of the coal miners for increased overtime and week-end rates, the tinplate-workers, aluminium trade workers, hat makers, leather workers and tobacco trade-workers.    There  is  no  suggestion   that   a   stoppage   will  take  place  in  any &apos;of these cases, except in the tobacco trade where a threat to strike unless the employers reply to the workers&apos; claim within a fortnight has been made.   There is some indication that a settlement of the Yorkshire painters dispute is in sight, as a conference represen-tativeof all parties has been arranged to be held at Leeds.   A statement issued this week by the Yorkshire Master Painters Federation defines the attitude of the employers towards, the dispute.  The-operatives are apparently satisfied with the working of the scheme of direct labour which has been organised.   There is no doubt, however, that both parties would welcome a settlement.   Another dispute which threatened a serious stoppage has been settled satisfactorily during the week.   The operatives in the levers section of the Nottingham Lace Trade decided by ballot to strike for the 25 per cent, increase on the bonus which they had demanded, but an agreement was reached at a meeting between representatives of the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Workers and the Notting-ham Lace Manufacturers&apos; Association, when the emploj^ers granted the 25 per cent, and the operatives in consideration of this concession agreed to withdraw their claim for retrospective payment of the increase from the 31st January.  The dispute in the Rhondda district where 20,000 miners threatened to strike over the alleged victimisation of two workmen employed by the Locketts Merthyr Colliery Company was also settled, after a short stoppage which took place on the 23rd February, by the intervention of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation.   A meeting with the Company was arranged at which terms acceptable to the men were offered, and work was then immediately resumed.The Unemployment Position.There was a total reduction of 15,821 in the number of H.M.F. policies remaining lodged between the 6th February and the 13th February, compared with a reduction of 33,022 between 30th January and 6th February, the total number of H.M.F. policies lodged on 13th February being 323,725 men and 4,548 women.Unemployment books remaining lodged on 13th February show a reduction during the week of 8,648, compared with a reduction during the previous week of 10,684. Books lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the .13th February were 79,019 for males, and 29,125 for females. At the 6th February 3,607 H.M.F. policies were lodged for short time workers, chiefly in the engineering and ironfounding trades.Employment Exchange total live registers at the 13th February were  416,892 men, 51,791 women, 24,590 juveniles compared with live registers at the 6tk February of: 443,085 men, 51,899 women, 25,497 juveniles, and at the 30th January of:  478,173 men, 52,479 women, 27,556 juveniles.   .The Nationalisation of the Mines. -.:................._____....................._______The decisions that have been taken during the week by the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress have been in accordance with the anticipation of their action suggested in this Report last week. On the 18th February the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress met to consider the request of the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation (which was made on the 6th February), that the special Congress which adjourned in-December should be summoned to reassemble &quot; at the earliest possible date &quot; to give effect to the resolutions on nation-alisation passed at the special Congress in December and the annual Congress at Glasgow. At this meeting the Parliamentary Committee reached no decision, but on the following day it met the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation, and arrangements were made for holding the special Congress on the 11th March. It is reported that the Parliamentary Committee was in favour of postponing the Congress till the 25th March, in order that plenty of time might be given to unions to obtain a fresh expression of policy from their members ; but that the Miners&apos; Federation specially requested an earlier meeting. This seems very probable, but it is not confirmed. On the 20th February, the executive.of the Miners&apos; Federation&apos;again met, and it was decided to call a national conference of miners&apos; delegates for the 10th March in order to discuss the policy to be advocated by the miners at the Congress on the. following day.
Negotiations have also taken place with regard to the financial position of the industry.. On the 19th February the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation considered the report of the independent accountant appointed by the Government to investigate the finances of the industry. On the same da)^ the executive was received by the Prime Minister, who was accompanied by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Labour, and the President of the Board of Trade. Mr. F. Hodges made a statement to the effect that they were satisfied that the disagreement of the accountant with the official estimates was well founded, and, so far as the actual position of the industry&apos;was concerned, the original view of the M.F.G.B. as to the surplus of profit at present being earned was substantially correct. They were in a position to prove that even on the estimate.from March, 1.919, to March, 1920, the surplus estimated b)^ the accountant was considerably below the correct figure. It was agreed that the interview should be adjourned until next week, and that, in the meantime, representatives of the M.F.G.B. should meet the independent accountant and examine with him the report presented to the Government, as compared with the figures prepared by the miners. On the 20th February the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation decided that Mr. V. Hartshorn and Mr. F. Hodges should meet the independent accountant on the 24th February in order to discuss the varying estimates of surplus, and that another meeting of the executive of the Federation should be held on the 25th February, at which the result of the conference should be reported, in prepara-tioii for the further meeting with the Prime Minister.To the detailed discussion in last week&apos;s Report of the attitude of the rank and file of the miners and of labour in general towards nationalisation there is nothing new to add.The Railways.The rank and file movement among the railwaymen is growing increasingly active, and at a recent conference of all the district councils of the National Union of Railway men, held in London, it was unanimously agreed to reaffirm the demand for the national ownership of the railways under the control of the workers. It was decided to recommend all branches of the union to instruct the executive committee to inaugurate a national campaign in order to secure the support of all sections of the community for an alteration of the ownership and control of the railway systems. In consequence of their dissatisfaction with the decision of the annual general meeting of the National Union of Railway men to approve of the acceptance of seats on the Railway Advisory Committee for Messrs. Thomas and Cramp, the conference also appointed a committee to go into the question of the control of the railways and to prepare a scheme of railway &quot; democratisa-tion &quot;for submission to the branches. Further steps were also taken towards securing closer unity of action during a national strike.The Control of the Liquor Trade.In connection with the Labour campaign for. the public ownership of the liquor trade, a conference of London delegates from trade unions and co-operative societies will be held on the 6th March. Mr. C. T. Cramp will preside, and Mr. J. R, Clynes, M.P., and Miss Margaret Bondfield will be the principal speakers. A resolution will be sub-mitted to the meeting calling upon the Government to embody the principle of public control in its Liquor Bill.Prices and Profiteering.The continued rise in the price of commodities is producing increased indignation hi the ranks of Labour. The rise in the price of sewing cotton and tobacco affects every household, and every working man knows the profits of Messrs. Coats and the Imperial Tobacco Company. The reasons given for the increase fail to convince him, in Yie\y of the magnitude of the profits of the companies, that it is justified, and the demanc). for effective Government action to check the rising tendency of prices is growing more in-sistent. A conference called by the Consumers&apos; Council was held on the 19th February, at Avhich Mr. H. M. Hyndman presided, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress, and the Co-operative Wholesale Societies were represented. Mr. G. H. Stuart Bunning moved a resolution expressing the opinion that, in view of the alarming and continuous increase in the,, cost of living, the demobilisation of the Ministry of Food was fraught with the greatest possible danger to the community. Mr. J. R. Clynes, M.P., supported the resolution, and, in spite of strong opposition expressed by the representatives of co-operative societies, it was carried. A campaign against profiteering is being engi-neered by the &quot;Daily Herald,&quot; which maintains that the profiteering &quot;that is rampant
is merely the manifestation of the principle of Capitalism-&quot; the principle of holding the public to ransom and getting the biggest price and the biggest profit possible,&quot; and the &quot;Daily Herald &quot; concludes that, unless we are to die by profiteering, we must have nationalisation of all the means of production. This extreme demand does not have any considerable practical support at present, but there is a real Labour demand that the Government^ machinery for the prevention of profiteering should be improved, and that profiteering should be punishable by imprisonment.Conciliation and Arbitration.The Twelfth Report of the Proceedings under the Conciliation Act, 1896, and a Report on Arbitration under the Munitions of War Acts compiled by the Ministry of Labour has been issued. The Report, which covers the years 1914-1918, begins with an examination of the position in regard to the settlement of labour disputes before the war, and traces the origin and progress of the new arbitration machinery which was created during the war. In connection with the latter it points out that the introduction of a measure of compulsory arbitration and the legal prohibition of strikes and lock-outs was made possible only by the abnormal conditions created by the war. War conditions were also responsible for the acceptance by Government Departments of the role of -emplojrer of labour, and led to a demand for a co-ordination of the Labour activities of the several Departments. The lack of such co-ordination was very much felt in the delay which took place in dealing with disputes. The Report describes the establishment of the War Cabinet Labour Committee under the chairmanship of the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P., to undertake this work by co-ordination, which was subsequently effected by administrative action through the Ministry of Labour. It deals fully with the setting up of the Committee on Production and with the more important case referred to it and to the Interim Court of Arbitration.Scottish Trades. Union Congress.The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress made a tour of Government departments last week. On the 16th February the deputation interviewed the Minister of Labour. Mr. Robert Allen submitted resolutions passed at the last meeting of the Congress, and further stated that the opinion of the Scottish Trades Union Congress was that the rates fixed in the Unemployment Insurance Bill were inadequate. As trade unionists they were in favour of a non-contributory scheme. Mr. Hugh Lyon objected that although the scheme was contributory, the men in the unions would have no control over it, and he advocated that trade unions should have some share in the management. The questions of apprenticeship aud the Glasgow subway strike were also raised. During its visit to London, the deputation also interviewed, the Home Secretary, the Minister of Transport and other Ministers.Amalgamation. ,The policy of amalgamation has been fostered by the Building Trades Federation, and within it the movement for fusion has been marked. The two unions of carpenters and. joiners are at present drawing up a scheme of amalgamation, and negotiations are also reported to be in progress in the group consisting of bricklayers, masons, slaters and tilers. The decision of the executive of the Monmouthshire and South Wales Colliery Enginemen, Stokers and Craftsmen&apos;s Association to recommend its members to vote in favour of amalgamation with the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has been confirmed by a special conference of the association. It is reported that the ballot of the Scottish Operative Tailors&apos; Union has assured amalgamation with the United Garment Workers&apos; Union. Negotiations are proceeding between the National Coal Porters&apos; Union and the United Vehicle Workers with a view to amalgamation.Trade Union Friction.With reference to the instance of friction mentioned in last week&apos;s report between the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation and the Dockers&apos; Union, it is further reported that there has been an exchange of views between the two organisations with regard to workpeople in the tinplate industry. The dockers announced that they would oppose with all their power any attempt on the part of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation to interfere with their members in tinplate works, and. they informed the officials of the other society that they were prepared to go to the length of holding up all the ports in order to defend their position. It would appear that in the meantime at least this threat has been.effective in staying any further action by the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.
Friction is also occurring in South Wales between the A.S.E. and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. The former society has entered an action* to restrain the federation from compelling A.S.E. members to join the federation. A deputation of the South Wales executive of the federation waited on the District Committee of the A.S.E. on the 16th February, and it was agreed to withdraw the case pending the treatment of the question on a national basis. It will be recalled that the S.W.M.F. has recently been particularly active in pursuing its policy of absorbing all workers engaged in and around the mines.Trade Union Finance.That the present time is a critical one for Trade Union finances was pointed out in this Report for the 10th December, 1919 (p. 474), and the reasons for this were discussed. Further testimony to the financial difficulties of Trade Unionism is provided in the current issue of the Quarterly Balance Sheet of the General Federation of Trade Unions, whose chief function now is &apos;to undertake the reinsurance of trade unions in respect of financial liabilities arising from strikes or lock-outs. Mr. W. A. Appleton, the Secretary, points out in his report that in the quarter ending 31st December, 1919,  145,710 9s.- 2d. was paid in connection with two disputes, the Cotton Strike and the Moulders&apos; Strike, and comments, &quot; the saddest thing about this expenditure is its failure to secure anything beyond what might have been secured by negotiations and without the strikes.&quot; He also draws atten-tion to the fact that on the quarters&apos; working the adverse difference between benefits and contributions is  132,871 16s. Id. He discusses the difficulties with which the G.F.T.U. is faced owing to the changed value of money, and points out that the chief obstacle to increasing the rate of benefits is the difficulty of fixing a rate of contribution which will attract and yet be reasonably safe. With regard to the possibility of devising a system of complete reinsurance of trade union liabilities, he points out that no federation or company can reinsure all financial liabilities arising out of strikes unless it controls the policy of the union, and has power to veto any strike which it regards as inopportune or unwise. &quot; Unless,&quot; he continues, &quot; the unions are willing to surrender even the last shreds of that autonomy they have so insistently fought for, it is not possible to devise even a basis upon which a common and complete strike fund could be built. The best that seems possible under existing circumstances is the strengthening of each union&apos;s own fund and the re-insuring of a part of its strike liability.&quot;Court of Inquiry.The Court of Inquiry set up under the Industrial Courts Act to inquire into the application of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation for a standard minimum wage of 16s. a day and other alterations in the conditions of employment of dock labour continued its sittings on the 18th, 19th and 20th February. On the 18th the Court continued to hear the evidence of witnesses called by the dockers in support of their claims. Early in the proceedings the question arose as to whether evidence on the subject of output should be taken at this stage ; the president stated that, as the Court hoped to bring out an interim report on the subject of wages, the evidence should at present be confined to wages and family budgets, although the bearing of wages on output would have to be considered. Mr. L. Brammell, a stevedore from Birkenhead, was the first witness. Mr. A. W. Buckner, clerk of the Tilbury Urban District Council, and Mr. H. R. Aldridge, secretary of the National Housing and Town Planning Council, gave evidence on housing conditions. Both witnesses considered that Sir Lynden Macassey&apos;s allowance of 6s. Qd. for rent was inadequate and in the opinion of the latter the rent for. workmen&apos;s houses in the future would not be below 10s. a week. Mr. J. Garmston, district secretary of the Dockers&apos; Union, Bristol, and Mr. A. Barnard, Dockers&apos; Union representative from Avon-, mouth, were next examined. Mr. Garmston, questioned on the workers&apos; opposition to the introduction of machinery, was of opinion that if the men were represented on the boards of management there would be no further resistance, and such a step would be the greatest factor in modernising conditions of labour. Subsequent witnesses were Mr. W. Paul, Dockers&apos; Union secretary at Southampton, Mr. J. Houghton, secretary of the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers, from Glasgow, Mr. D. Bonham, union representative from Port Talbot, Mr. J. Donovan, union secretary at Cardiff, and Mr. Farrer from Hull. Mr. Houghton stated that, although the Glasgow dockers at present received 14s. a day, they had agreed to accept the. 16s. standardisation and not ask for higher rates. , He also stated that the Glasgow dockers would be opposed to any system of registration ; even* The case referred to is that of Rosser and Jones v. Hawkins, which was down for hearing in the Chancery Division on the 18th February. It is an action in which the plaintiffs, who are members of the A.S.B., and employed at the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company&apos;s pits, allege the officials of the local branch of the. S.W.M.F. are seeking to coerce them to leave the A.S.E. and join the Federation.
-............--------- .......-------------------.-______-l-......._________________...       ........____j^^^-..l.^:.-^^u^^a,L.;w^:110&quot;a scheme recommended by the Court he believed would receive very little consideration. Mr. Donovan said he had not found that the existing minimum wage for piece-workers at Cardiff tended to diminish output because-the men were anxious to earn more than the minimum. On the 19th February Sir Leo Chiozza Money gave evidence in support of the dockers&apos; claims. Asked to explain how he proposed to prevent the extra cost of the wages from being passed on to the consumer, Sir Leo said that the State should requisition the mercantile marine as it did during the war, or else nationalise the shipping. It could then utilise its freights to relieve the consumer and to pay higher wages to the workers.The first witness on the employers&apos; side was Professor A. L. Bowley, Professor of Sta-tistics, University of London, who had been a member of Lord Sumner&apos;s Committee on the Cost of Living to the Working Classes. He submitted a budget for a railway porter living in London on a wage of 61s. Mr. Bevin subjected him to a severe cross-examination on the items of this budget.On the 20th February Mr. Bevin continued his cross-examination of Professor Bowley. The next witness, Mr. Ross Johnson, general manager of the Bristol and Avonmouth Docks, said that in normal times men who wanted work could get it on the average five days a week. He produced evidence to show that the guaranteed minimum wage for grain men at the City Docks, Bristol,. resulted in diminished output. After the evidence of this witness the Court adjourned until the 25th February.Payment by Results.In view of the situation with regard to payment by results in the engineering trades which was discussed in last week&apos;s Report, it is interesting to note that the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinet Makers and Joiners had issued to its members a circular denning its attitude to syterns of payment by results. From this circular it is clear that the traditional, opposition of the woodworking trades to this method of payment is increasing.   The more important passages in the Report are as follows : *As there appears to be some doubt in the minds of some of our members as to what constitutes a system of payment by results, we desire to point out that all kinds of bonuses, whether termed &quot; time-keeping bonus,&quot; &quot;merit bonus,&quot; or sums of money paid at the end of the week in addition to the amount of hourly wages earned, are all departures from the hourly method of payment and therefore must be considered systems of payment by results. Our branches and district committees must deal with members who accept any kind of bonus according to rule, and the mere fact that, in some establishments, where our members are employed on the hourly system, but where there are other trades employed on piece-work or premium bonus, and the balance or surplus over and above certain percentages allowed by the firm is equally divided amongst all employees, our members are still accepting a bonus which results from the efforts of other individuals employed on systems of payment by results, they are consequently aiding in the continuance of a pernicious system which the majority of our members strongly oppose. It matters not where our members may be employed, whether in railway shops, engineering establish-ments, private factories, or private establishments of any kind, it is not per-missible for them to accept any kind of bonus.Housing.In addition to the Manchester Building Guild another organisation for promoting the building of workmen&apos;s dwellings has sprung up in the same locality known as the National United Housing Association. The scheme&quot; originated among- the operative builders but, unlike the Building Guild, it is not connected officially with the building trade unions. The members of the association are to subscribe a shilling a week and these subscriptions will form the nucleus of the building fund. The promoters anticipate that they will obtain 20,000 members and they hope to begin building in three months; they calculate that it will be possible to build eight-roomed houses, with a bathroom, for  600 each. It may be noted that this figure corresponds closely with the estimate of the leaders of the Building Guild movement. The money is to be raised free of interest. The association believes that people will be glad to continue their yearly subscription of  2 12s. for the chance of obtaining a house soon and the certainty of obtaining one later, towards the purchase of which they will have been saving, since the total of their subscriptions-tions is to be deducted from the purchase price. The rents of the occupied houses will go to swell the building fund, which will, it is hoped, grow rapidly as the association pro-ceeds with its work. The association has issued a prospectus explaining the details of its scheme. ;
All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour, / Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.The Tinplate Trade. The investigation into American methods in the tinplate trade, which has recently been made by a joint deputation of employers and workpeople, has resulted in certain suggestions for the reorganisation of the industry, more particularly with regard to the squad on the mills. In the United States two squads work alternately throughout the shift, and it is proposed in South Wales that the number of men on each mill should be increased by two. This is expected to increase output by 33^ per cent. The proposal has caused some discontent among the shearmen, who will have to deal with this increased product, and a delegate meeting is shortly to be held to consider action if their request for an additional shear to each three mills be not conceded. The great prosperity of the industry is influencing a reorganization in the direction of higher efficient-ency, and it is almost certain that the plans of the shearmen will be adopted if their suggestions, as they claim, are favourable to greater production.International Labour Developments.In connection with the decision of the International Miners&apos; Committee, mentioned in last week&apos;s Report, to recommend international action to support the demands of the French miners, it may be noted that the National Federation of Transport Workers also contemplate action in support of the demands of foreign comrades. The Federation recently sent a letter to the Dutch Consul-General in London, notifying him that, unless the Dutch shipowners agree to an international scale of wages, British dockers will refuse to unload Dutch ships. This threat has already been carried out to some extent, and in the Bristol Channel ports a number of men are refusing to load Dutch ships out of sympathy with the Dutch seamen on strike at Amsterdam. It is also reported that the crew of the British steamer &quot;Swift&quot; refused to unload the vessel on its arrival atAmsterdam. In preparation for the International Conference on the hours of employment and conditions of labour of seamen, to be held at Genoa, a questionnaire has been issued by the Inter-national Labour Office.Ex-Service Men.Comrades of the Great War. The Grand Council of the County of London Division of the Comrades of the Great War, representing some 30,000 ex-Service men, has sent a strong resolution to all Government Departments advocating that discharged soldiers should have preference in employment, precedence being given to disabled men. A resolution has been sent to the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Pensions urging the increase of waiting allowances to men awaiting training. The Grand Council advocate a revision of the whole question of training.Trade Unions and Ex-Service Men. It is reported from Scotland that a stimulus to the training of ex-Service men in the engineering industry has been given by the altered -attitude of a number of the members of the Clyde District Committee of the A.S.E., who were formerly strongly opposed to such schemes.R. S. HORNE.
