f,SECRET/This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic iViajssty&apos;s Government)193THE     CABINET.PROVISION OF STORES REQUIRED BY THIS ADMIRALTY, WAR OFFICE AND AIR MINISTRY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air-With reference to the second paragraph of the Conclusions of Cabinet Conference of the 9th December, 1919, I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a memorandum in regard to the provision of stores for the Admiralty, TCar Office and Air Ministry, which has been prepared after consultation with the other departments concerned, and which advocates the institution of an inter-departmental Committee under a Chairman to be appointed by the Cabinet in preference to the creation of a Central Purchasing Department.WINSTON St CHURCHILL.Air Ministry.,27th February, 1920.
MEM0RAT1DTJ!!.1* - in accordance with the directionn contained inparagraph 2 of the Conclusions of Cabinet Conference of the 9th December 1010, lists of standardised stores in common use by the Royal Air Force and the other fighting services have been sent forward to the Ministry of Munitions* ,2. These lists have been compiled on the following assumptions(a) That the responsibility for storage of bulk stocks and reserves of stores will rest with the department which uses them;(b) That the using department will be responsible for the issue of such stores whether in bulk or detail;(c) That design and specification will rest with the using department.3. The lists are classified under two heads.   Onelist includes those vfliioh could probably he purchased to specification by a Central Purchasing Department subject to test inspection on receipt at Royal Air Force Depots.The Other list covers stores in the case of -&apos;hich, o^in^ to their technical nature or other considerations, it would he difficult for the Central Purchasing Department to decide whether a slight variation from specification could be allowed.     It is considered that stores of this category should be inspected or tested by the Air Ministry before acceptance.For the sake of brevity and in view of their similarity to those prepared by the War Office and the Admiralty, the lists prepared by the Air Ministry are not annexed to this Memorandum.4. It is considered that the Air Ministry cannot .delegate to another department the responsibility for rejecting stores which owing to faulty material or errors in manufacture do not come up to the requirements of the Royal Air Force.5* Arms, bombs, ammunition and stores which requirethe most exact Conformity to specification for material or d esign, on the grounds that any deviation therefrom may endanger the lives of those who handle them,, are not included.    The lists however, include stores which, though different in type,, are similar in character to those in use by other departments.6. As regards tho general question of a CentralPurchasing Department it is understood that the main objects which it is hoped to secure by the creation of such a department are as follows(a)   The avoidance of competition between different government departments (more particularly in the event of War) and the oo-ordinntion of production by means of an efficient Central control.(b) The avoidance of the purchase of stores by one department when another department has a surplus of the particular category required.
(o)   The standardisation (so. far as practicable) of articles in common use by two or nore departments. These objects have been kept in view during the compilation of the lists above mentioned.7. Whatever scheme may finally be adopted for the .central purchase of stores it is considered essential -(a) That responsibility for the maintenance of adequate stocks and reserves of all stores required for the Royal Air Force should rest with the Air Minis try.(b) That such stocks and reserves should be stored in depots under the control of the Air Ministry.It is thought that confusion must inevitably result from the control of Royal Air Force stocks and reserves of stores by another departments8* It is further assumed that the Central PurchasingDepartment will be responsible for the purchase of such articles only as are in common use by more than one department and that it will therefore still be necessary for each department to maintain an independent Contracts Branch.9- This being the case the necessity for setting up an independent Central Purchase Department to purchase stores which could equally well be obtained direct by the department which will use them would appear to be open to question.10. It is therefore suggested that, as an alternativeand more economical method of securing central control, it might be possible to develop the system already in vogue in a rudimentary form before the war, namely the co-ordination of the purchase of stores by means of a Committee comprising representatives of the provisioning branches of the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry.11. The Chairman of this Committee should be appointedby the Cabinet and its principal functions should be as follows :-(a) To co-ordinate the demands of the several departments as the interests of economy may require and to secure that full advantage is taken of all opportunities for purchase in bulk with a view to the reduction of prices.(b) To suggest modifications in pattern in order to secure the greatest possible measure of standardisation of articles in common use.12. An additional consideration which points to theinstitution of such a Committee as preferable to the creation of a Central Purchasing Department is the fact that for the next few years it is unlikely that any Extensive purchases of stores (other than consumable stores) will be required.     The elaborate machinery of a Central Purchasing Department would therefore appear unnecessary, and ample opportunity would be given for the Committee to consider the organisation best adapted to secure an efficient and economical &quot;system of supply, since there would be no constant pressure of current demands.
