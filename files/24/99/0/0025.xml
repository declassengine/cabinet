IHB PEACE OWTCERENGE AKD MONIEHEGRO.   - :  ; &apos; &apos;r&apos;-&quot; ^&apos;  87^31.725Summary of Proceedings of the Supreme Council on this subject.The question of Montenegro first came up at the second Meeting of the Council of Ten when the representation at the Peace Conference of the various.States was und^r consideration.    The position then was that serbip was claiming that Montenegro had become a part of the State under the rule of the Karageorgivich monarchy, and that a Constituent Assembly at Podgoritza, December 1918, had agreed that Montenegro should be absorbed by Serbia.   The King of Montene^ro&quot;had-challeng^ji.The decision of the Constituent Assembly and had Stated that it was invalid and negligible.   At this Meeting, President Wilson admitted, -that the action of the Serbs had almost&apos;:msde him a partisan of Montenegro.   He claimed that Serbia had taken&quot;.self-determination out of the hands of Montenegro, which he pointed out was an older State than Serbia.   Eventually it was decided in principle that Montenegro should be represented -at the Conference, but the decision was left open as to how her representa-tives should be chosen.   On this occasion, M.Sonnino suggested that the United States of America should send a representative to discover how things were in Montenegro.   M.Clemenceau pointed out that if President Wilson wished to send someone to enquire, he would do so without any authority from the Powers associated with him.   President Wilson then said&apos; he was willing to send someone, but not an official representative on behalf of the Peace Conference, and Mr.Lloyd George agreed.   (I.C. 104) - January 12th, 1919.The decision as to the representation of Montenegro was confirm-j-ed three days later, when it was decided that Montenegro should berepresented by one delegate^but that the rules concerning thei designation of this delegate ,sho,uld not be fixed until a moment when the political situation of the country shall have been cleared up.(1.0.107 (2) ).The political situation jjerer was cleared, and Montenegro consequently remained unrepresented et the Conference.
Mil       Montenegro next appears on. january^-2la4^--191:9, when theJonference sanotioned the issue &quot;by the King of MoTrt^egro^f &quot;tlfflr -following message to his people:-&quot;To my People - (.. .I implore you to return quietly to your hoskea and not to oomhat with arms the forces which are seeking to obtain control of our Country. I have received the highest assurances that early and ample opportunity will be ^iven to the people of Montenegro to decide upon the j politioal form of their future government.And by this decision, so far as it concerns me, I will gladly abide. &quot; (1,0.113 - 11)On January  2nd President Wilson inoldBn^ally&quot; -drw-airt^ntion to the fact that Serbia was behaving towards Montenegro &quot;in wjfaat appeared! to him to be a questionable manner&quot;.   (1.0,115 - 1).It may be noted that the Albanian Delegation in making its olaims of February 24th, 1919, urged that all the territory given, \,v Montenegro by the Treaty of Berlin and the Conference of. London^ 1913, should be restored.   (I.C148-3.   Appendix B.)On March.5th the Council of Ten heard a statement made, by General pvozuenovitch on behalf of the King of Montenegro,/   It oon-^ sis ted mainly in a vehement protest against the attitude of the Serbs, and the ootion of the Assembly of Podgoritza.,w:ith an urgent plea for the application to Montenegro of the principle of self-ietermination.     The views of the Delegation on the frontiers were, reserved for some future ocoasiont    -(l.C 154 (9) J&apos;.On April 28th, when the Council of Four were discussing the question of the recognition of the Yugo-Slavs, prior to oommunioat-ing the preliminaries of peace to the German Delegates, President wilson is recorded as having made the following remark;-     &quot;Serbia lad, he believed, in some legal form or other merged herself with the Yugo-Slavs;   the Montenegrins had not.&quot;    (I.C.177a)
On May 7th, President Wilson st the Council of Pour said,\&quot;He had received a letter from e gentleman who signed himsslf, President of the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs for Montenegro, claiming a place at the Conference in the afternoon, on the ground that Montenegrin had been an effective belligerent. He did not raise the question of his being present this afternoon, but he thought a decision ought to be taken in regard to Montenegro before the Austrian settlement was eotfoludad.&quot; hlhis was agreed to.?) -   1.0.181.E (6)Sir Maurice Hsnkey drew the attention of the Council of Pourto the above decision when the Austrian Treaty was nearing comple-(C.P.13.A,(15) &amp; CP.14 (4) tion. / President Wilson was then reminded by Mr. Lloyd George ofhis promise to send a commissioner to investigate and report on matters in Montenegro, and after the question had several timesbeen referred to, President Wilsdn on the 17th May said that the investigation had been undertaken,end that he was expecting thereport in the near future.    The question was then adjourned pendingthe receipt of the report expected by President Wilson.   (CP.16 - 15)If the report was ever received, it was never communicated to the Pe&amp;conference.The question did not come up again at the Peace Conference until December 1st, when the Council of the Heads of Delegations of the five Great Powers (Mr. Polk, Sir Eyre Crowe, M. Clemenceau, M. di Martino, and M. Matsui), had under consideration a letter ftfom M. Plamen8t2 protesting against the injustice, of the Peace Conference in regard to Montenegro, and begging that tha Montenegrin delegate might be convoked, and threatening if a favourable reply was not received, to address the Governments of Germany, Austria and Bulgaria with a request to conclude a separate peaoe.   The Council decided that no reply should be sent to this latter. (H.D.103 - 9, Appendix L.) ...
Mr.Polk end Sir Eyre Crowe on the subject of the Adriatic which was harmed to M. &quot;Joialo ja on December 12th contained, an annexed M^oranctum iw 5 ch includes the following statement in paragraph 3 :-&quot;The right to control the development of the Boysna River shall be Vested in the Council of the League of Nations with power to delegate the work to either Itsly or the Serb^Croat-Slovene State under proper restrictions *   It is assumed for this purpose that Montenegro, will form pert of the Serb-Croat-Slovene State &quot;7&apos;.This, however, cannot be regarded as a decision&apos;of thedelegateConference, since neither the Italian nor the-Japanese/took pert in it.It should be noted that the proposals in regard to the Adriatic question handed to the Serb-^Jroet-^oveoie^^ on January 20th, 19fid, contemplated giving to the Serb-Croat-Slovene ikrvexnment a mandate over a portion of northern ^Albania (inoluding Soutari), which is claimed, by and has in the notdistanrt past been occupied by Montenegro.     During the whole of the discussionsleading up to this note, which were spread over 10 days, Montenegro does not appear-to-have been mentioned as having separate interests from those of the ^erb-Croat-Slovene State.     It is understood, however, from the British Expert that the assumption contained in the Memor-andum of December 9th, wlrich has been quoted above, that , Montenegro would form part of the Serh-Croat--SloTene State applies also for the purposes of the later negotiations.It will be seen, therefore, that no positive decision has been taken ss regards the future position of Montenegro although for the purpose of particular negotiations it has been assumed that Montenegro would form part of the Serb-Croat-Slovene State.(signed) BERTHELOT. .
