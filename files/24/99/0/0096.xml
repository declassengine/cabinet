Gossage, D.S.0.,MC.   1The Committee., having considered the points enumeratedabove bog to offor tho following remarks and recommendationsj-It was found cohveniont to deal with (1) and (2) of the reference together. - j(1) lc (2)        THE DISTRIBUTION OF LETHAL WEAPONS THROUGHOUT THECOUNTRY MID,THE MEASURES TAKEN FOR GUARDING, THEM:     The Oommittoo \ unanimously agree that bulk stores of propellants, explosives and shells of largo calibre&apos; would bo impossible to-*guard owingIto the wido distribution of such material throughout the country.   An additional safeguard lies in tho fact that the danger of handling such oxploslves would to some extent deter ill-disposed individuals from attempting to use them./in
In the samo category may be incdu&amp;ed^-dertonai^rs * whioh are dangerous to handle and of little destructive effect.In regard to light bombs and hand-gronados, it na&amp; &quot;been, ascertained that, although thoro arc large quantities of suoh scattered throughout the country in charge of tho Ministry of Munitions, they are, so far as can be ascertained, unprovided with ignitors, and are therefore harmless.   In the event of it being dosirod to have a further safeguard for the storage of igniters, arrangements can bo made for their safe custody at Woolwioh, but the Committee doubt whether there is any necessity for this precaution so long as they are stored apart from bombs and gronades,The Committee, therefore, confined its investigations to small arms (including bayonets and pistols).   Machine Guns and small&quot; arm ammunition.     The distribution of theeo on charge of tho various Departments is as followsj-MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS:      The only place at Which tho Ministry ofMunitions have rifled and machine guns is at Enfield, with themachineexception of a very few/guns at Birmingham, which are without looks, and a few at Woolwioh Arsenal where thojr are adequately guarded.   A considorable quantity of small arm ammunition is stored at Woolwioh Arsenal.It has boon pointed out,by the representative of the Ministry of Munitions that at tho present moment there is some delay in hanc U&amp;^ovor completed articles to tho Army, but that the bolts of riflos that aro still awaiting dispatch have boon removed and the arms thus rondorod useless.ADMIRALTY;    All small arms and machine guns aro under Naval charge &quot;at naval ports.   Tho bolts or other essential parts of the mechanism havo boon romoved, and are stored separately.Arrangements havo been made by the Admiralty for the safe custody of tho arms of Sea Scouts and Cadet Corps under Admiralty administration./war OFFICE.
WAR OFFICE?   All arms under charge of the War Office are at present adequately guarded.As regards tho arms of Territorial Units (including Cadet Corps), If, and when, thoy are issued to the Force it is suggested that the only feasible plan Is to make tho G.O.C. in Chief of the Command responsible for their safe custody, and, in the event of unrest, for the removal, when he considers necessary, of tho bolts and bayonets to a place of safety.It was pointed out by the War Offico representative that, while the Army will guard all arms and ammunition on their charge, or for which they are responsible, it will practically exhaust all soldiers available for guards.AIR .MIHISTRY: The only weapons, other than those held by units, on charge of the Air Ministry, are 50,000 machine guns at Kidbrooko (near Woolwich) and 26,000,000 rounds of small arm ammunition.     The bolts and component part3 of the machine guns at Kidbrooke have beon removed and are stored at Ruislip.The Air Ministry undertake to provide an adequate guard for both these establishments during periods Of grave industrial unrest in order to supplement the Police protection which will, in normal timos, be responsible for the Safeguarding of these two places,Tho Committoo wore informed that tho Air Ministry will shortly bo breaking duftm some of their machine guns, the permanent requirements amounting to only 20,000,ARMS IN POSSESSION-OF THE TRADE:     Tho question of arms and explosives in possession of trade firms was discussed, and it 7/ould appear that these exist mainly under two headsi-(a) Stock in hand, or being manufactured for export.(b) Arras, &amp;c. bought from the Government to be broken I                  Tho stook referred to in (a) is almost entirely to befound at Birmingham and Coventry, and at the former place there is without doubt a considerable number of arms of different makes and kinds.    There are no military at Birmingham, and/the
*thtf*Committee are of opinion that, should the situation throughout the country develop towards a point at which it would ho necessary for the Government to take over and guard the stocks in the hands of private firms, tho timo would he reached when martial law would have to he declared, and the-military would perforoo take charge of the situation at tho places referred to.As regards (b),,lt rests with tho Government to delay or cancel delivery until such timo as it may be considered safo to distribute weapons, ammunition, &amp;c. to places whore it will not be possible to effectively guard them.THE BEST METHOD OF MAKING LETHAL WEAPONS AVAILABLE TO LOYALISTS IN THE EVENT OF AMY EMERGENCY:     Tho Committee are of opinion that, although under tho Common Law it is permissible fora man to tako up arms in solf defence, it will be necessary in aicrisis suGh as is anticipated by the reference to this Committeeto organise loyalists into oatffcoB and units beforo any distribution^of arms is made to them.Should the condition of tho country dovolon into a situation requiring the issue of arms to persons unconnected with the -Forces of tho Crown, it would socm that legislative action would bo necessary in order to legalise such drastic, measures, and tho Committee are of opinion that two alternative^ present themselvoB.-fa) That power should ba taken to enlistLoyalists into tho regular Forces of tho Crown for a short term of enlistment to tide over the Crisis, in whioh case they would be drafted intOv existing units which are at present quartered in tho United Kingdom.   The requisite number of officers would bo obtained by the grant of temporary commissions.or(b) That the present Special Constabularyorganisation should be made use of, the local Police Authorities with tho assistance of the Admiralty and/War Office
War Office making a selection from volunteers of - those who had been accustomed to the use of arms.The apparent anomaly of using a Police organisation for the purpose of creating an armed force can be explained by the&apos; precedent of 1909-10, when a General Officer was placed in command of both iiilitary and.Police Forces on the occasion of a Strike.The Committee recommend alternative (b)Tho Committee consider that, should an emergency necessitating the creation of such a Force occur, the country would to all intents       purposes bo under martial law.The distribution of arms to loyalist units would be best carried out by the War Office.   The Regimental Depots throughout the country being adequately guarded are the only suitable places to keep arms ready stored, and it is suggested that tho far Office be asked to hold at each Regimental Depot 1,000 stand of arms, together with an adequate amount of small arm ammunition for distribution under orders of thy G.O.C. in Chief, Commands.Chairman AdmiraltyC?.3f,?IA0READI.
