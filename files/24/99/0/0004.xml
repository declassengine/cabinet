JThiG Document fa t&apos;- Prone^v of     ^ military secret. 1298&quot;&quot;&apos;J cp. *7 01 *Vwa Wiceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, lp\ &apos; 13^ February 1920.&quot;TV, _____________v (Repeated Baghdad and Kasvin under R. 12.)&apos;--./ &apos;A LL G &apos;Vv^ (Received 20th.)1884.  Malleson wires dated 9th February, repeating Teheran :-&quot; My Turkoman agency tell me Bolsheviks are now actively collecting camels ^throughout Merv area.   Numerous Turkman agents are being sent out and payment ais made for all camels in Bolshevik paper.  As much as 100,000 roubles is given for &apos;cfsingle camels. I have special agents for these proceedings and shall be able to report later what camels are intended for. It is improbable that they are required to carry munitions of war into Afghanistan as Afghans would in such cases provide transport. They may be required (a) for bringing in fuel and food from out-districts, (b) for operations against Yamuts, between Khiva and Krasnovodsk ; or (c) for operations against Khorasan.&quot;
