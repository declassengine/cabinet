For nearly five years tho energies of the people have boon diverted from the work of production to the work of destruction:for nearly five years the creation of new resources has been stopped and the resources of past/generations3 g C R E 0 A B X N 3 T, .-,-----&apos; DBQLARATION ON THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OP THE WO313)*(As approved fry tho Supreme Councilon March StrT, 1920.The Supreme Council of tho Peace Conference has taken intoconsideration the causes which combine to produce the present,  high cost of living and now thinks it desirable tc&apos;publish thefollowing declaration:-3NERA1      (1)   The war which the democracies of Western Europe wore ATEMEKT? THE    forced to undertake in defence of their liberties and which they )SITION.have carried to a triumphant conclusion has necessarily entailed the disorganisation of the wholo economic position of Europe.This disorganisation is reflected in the rise of prices which is at present the source of universal discontent among the peoples, belligerent and neutral alike.     History shows that high prices are the invariable result of war, and in comparison with meet wars the present situation is far from abnormal.   In the Napoleonic wars, prices In England rose 75 per cent, and took eight years to beoome normal again.   In the American Civil War American prices rose 100 per cent, and took twelve years or more to become normal.   As the result of this war, the most gigantic of all in the history of the worlds general wholesale prices (as distinct from the cost of living) have advanced since 1913 approximately as follows:-Tho United States................. 120 per cent.
generations consumed or destroyed.     To feed and equip the nations engaged in this struggle, their Governments had to mortgage the prospective wealth of their countries in the form of credits or paper money.     The excessive creation of thesewealth, is indicated by the rise in prioes.Nothing but the hard necessities of war could have justified or excused this procedure.     Its dangers are obvious,     Public appreciation of the necessity of maintaining a strict balance between normal revenue and expenditure is weakened, and the ordinary individual is misled by the illusion of prosperity to believe that there is an increase in-real wealth and an abundance of available supplies, and is encouraged in habits of extravagance.Government action may mitigate or disguise some of the effects of the rise in prices, but it cannot remove the root cause, which is the destruction of wealth.     This loss of wealth is, after all, but a small matter compared with the sacrifice of life which was ffeely given during the war to overthrow militarism and re-establish national liberty in Europe,     But its effects can .onl  be healed by the passage of time, and the people of Europe, .if they wish to expedite the process, must contribute to the works, of peace the same ardour and devotion as they gave to the prosecution of the war.     In the sub-joined review of the position the Conference indicates the lines on which it considers that a solution of the problem can best be found;     but it is vain to expect that . the result of the war can be eliminated by a stroke of the pen.PEAOE   (2)   At present Europe is far from having returned to thetokens of prospective wealth, as compared with the volume of realNOT cabinet RE*      condi ESTABLISHED.conditions of complete peace.Russia is stated to have
309 1in the-^fXeOxTajrai-cir ri VdOCU-OOO-J&amp;en-or-more and the /li^foajooV ment of these armies is, of course, a primary c^ndJLtijor of European peace.   But many also of the countries which have beer created or enlarged as the outcome of the war have still the appearance of armed camps; and not less than 1,000,000 men are still under arms in Pcland, Roumania and the new States created out of Austria Hungary.. Moreover, although armed conflict has ceased, the mutal rivalries and antipa-thies vhich are the natural legacy.rf war, still dominate-many of the nations of Europe, and are leading to the erection of artificial economic barriers which must   u riuUdly  hamper if they do not entirely prevent, the restoration of the common prosperity.The first step to the reconstruction of Europe is to complete the process of demobilisation in all countries, to resume-the full employment in peaceful pursuits of the whole of the able bodied population and to encourage by every means.thjEL.rm J. Interchange of their products.Until peace^-&apos;fuJL ooiidliions have thus, been resumed in every branch of life, Europe, which has suffered so terribly during the past years of strife, will continue to suffer from the restlessness and lack ftf confidence which ijs the natural jxmaaqiLenee of the..up.?? heaval through which she has passed.(3)   liberty has, indeed, been preserved to Europe and the threat of military domination is gone,   This great achieve-ment has hov/ever left victors and vanquished alike impover-ished and enfeebled.   Death or disablement has removed from ^the work of production millions of men in the prime of life; and millions more have had their efficiency impaired by sufferings on the field of battle or throu.$i pestilence or -privations at home.   Instead ?f having the. assistance of these sons, each country has to provide, in the most generous measure possible for the maintenance of the maimed and for the families of the fallen, and this /
must for many years to come be the first charge on tho iie^l^ma3^J^wm6-*,, Meanwhile those who remain have not yet recovered the former habit of industry, and have not yet re-adjusted their standard of output to com-Jpensate for the reduction of hours which public opinion in all countries has demanded and is securing.    At the same time, of the machinery which might have made good, these deficiencies, much has been destroyed, and more has been worn out, no adequate renewals being possible during the war.   In particular, all means of transport have been disorganised, and the efficiency of the railway systems has been universally impaired.To these general losses, must be added the special disturbances of production in each country.   For example, a large portion of the most fertile territory, more especially in France and in the North of Italy, has been devastated; while in,France also industrial centres and mining areas, of vital importance to her industries, have been completely des-troyed and will not be able to resume production for years to come. In Belgium, similarly, the national industries suffered greatly during the period of occupation.   Germany, on the other hand, has its industrial establishments intact but is paralysed by lack of capital and credit and by the disorganisation bred of defeat; while in the case of Austria these conditions have led to the complete breakdown of her^etMraomio.** ife. Russia has passed through all the throes of civil strife and is still the victim of confusion and anarchy. Each country suffers from.a differ-ent difficulty but each contributes its share to the common deficit.In agriculture, Russia, which before the war was the most important granary of Europe and of whose products Europe is in such need, either has not been producing at all or has not been able to exchange with her neighbours such products as she has,Roumania, which before the war exported annually over six million quarters of wheat has altered her system of land tenure and is now ceasing to produce more than suffices for the immediate needs of her -own population; indeed,&apos;on the 1st December last it was stated that only 530,000 hectares had been sown as compared with an annual average before the war of 1,500,000 hectares though some improvement has since taken place.   Other countries again such as France and Germany which were largely self-supporting/
are unable at the-present moment, owing to the deras-baiion of - the -land, the desi^ruc-the of buiJ/lingS-^and, -.machinery, or the lack of capital and fertilisers, to produce more than a fraction of what is required for their own needs,and have b-een increasingly &quot;driven to compete in the world market for the limited supplies now available.Again, in regard to coal,, production in every country has been decreased, the approximate figures of output inmetric t*ms for 1913 and 1919 respectively being as follows;-1913 1019.U.K.  ...............     292,000,000 234,069,900Prancef^?^^f.^tI&amp;inU, 000,000 22,000,00*Germany^(Excluding Saarand Lorraine) 173,000,000 I19,00fi,-$o$U.S.A................. 517,000,001 495,^00,000xExclusive of lignite. ,, Although detailed statistics are not available, such information as we have, goes to show that the output&apos;of factories and manufacturing industries throughout the world is below the standard which prevailed before the uar, and far below the demands now made upon them.   The net result of under-production arising from these various causes Is an acute shortage of the essential supplies on which the economic life of Europe depends.This situation&apos;requires to be met with the same courage as was displayed on both sides during the war.   The energy which was then thrown into the production of foodstuffs must be revived and redoubled in order to restore the situation. It must be made a point of honour with the tillers of the soil in every country to show that peace can extract from nature more than war.   Europe must take measures to provide herself more largely with tho food she requires in order that she may resume her full activities and much can be effected if the necessary preparations are made without delay,
*M        ^      mmIn regard to industry -genorallyp each Governmentrmust take.-Stepsr^ ^ to impress on its people that the limitation of productlon-jJirectlyassists the upward movement of prices and that it is by increasing production that they can best help to solve the problem.   Every proposal which may assist in this direction deserves the closest attention.Governments must co-operate in the reconstruction of the commoneconomic life of Surope, which is vitally inter-related, by facil-itating the regular inter-change of their products, and by avoidingarbitrary obstruction of the natural flow of European trade.The Powers represented at the Conference re-affirm their deter-mination to collaborate with a view to the execution of these aims.(CREASE   (4)    Meanwhile, instead of restricting the stand&amp;srd of consumption r COU-JMPTION. in view of this shortage of supplies, there is a general tendency , to make heavier and heavier demands for the limited quantities .of gOods that are available!     The increase of consumption takes the form of an intensified demand for commodities of every descript-ion.     The demand not only for food-stuffs but for clothing, boots and other manufactured articles is in most countries far in exoess of the supply, while luxuries of every kind command a readier sale than at almost any previous period.The general extravagance now observable throughout the world is a phenomenon which has almost invariably followed in the foot steps of every great human catastrophe.     It is well known to those who have lived in a district which has suffered from earthquake, and the history of the great plagues of Europe amply &apos; illustrates it; and tha results have always been, economically disastrous for the populations affected.     It must be cue of the first aims of each Government to take such measures as appear$ appropriate to tho circumstances of its own people to bring home to every citizen the/
the fact that for the time being, until supplies .aj^-.inxj*oosodr it is by diminished consumption and-unselfish denial that they arc best able to help themselves and the world, and that extravagance increases the national difficulties and perils.(5&quot;)   The immense increase in the spending power of Europe which   Iis reflected in this extravagance has been brought about bycredit ahd currency inflation during the war.     Broadlyspeakingj the general level of prices may be said to be theexpression of the ratio between spending power on the one h,andand the volume of purchasable goods and services on the other.In order to prosecute the war, particularly in European countries^every Government found it necessary to increase the amount of currency in circulation.   Unable to raise sufficient funds bytaxation and by loans from real savings, they were compelled to resort to borrowing from the Banks and the use of the printingpress.   Additional spending power was thus placed in the hands ofthe public at a time when the volume of purchasable goods wasbeing reduced. Por example^ the note circulation has grownapproximately as follows:&quot;In the United Kingdom fflora  30,000,000 in 1913 to nearly 4^0,000,000 at the end of 1919. (About  120,000,000 of the latter figure takes the place of gold coins in circulation in 1913):In France^ from  230,000,000 in 1913 to  1,500,000,.CKXXin3319: In Italyx   from  110,000,000 in 1013 to  7OQ,OOQ,000 in 19X9 :In Belgium^ from  40,000,000 in 1913 to  200,000,000 in 19&quot;20-:while the war.debts (which are closely connected with in-flat ion) amount, in the case of the United Kingdom, to over  7/000,000,000In Francex to  6,750,000,000In Italyx to   2,750,000,000In Germany   (apart from liabilities for reparation) -to  9,^00,000,000In the United Statosx to  5,000,000,000TheTOTE:-   The national currencies have in each case boon converted into sterling at approximately par of exchange.
$he total was debt of-^ttwnwrOd^JLa^Through^mtuJhI^^po^ri^as at present are with few exoeptions-^psper prices.   But gold prices have also risen, that is to say, gold has a lower purchasing power than it had &quot;before the War.   This Is the inevirfc able result of the many economies which have been effected in the use of goia for monetary purposes aad, on the other hand, of the dispersal of stocks of gold previously held in Europe and their excessive aocuflu-lation in other countries.    Thus, in the United States, although the gold standard remains effeotive, prices have advanced 120$ over the pre war level.   As the purchasing power of gold is ultimately th6 measure af price, it must be obvious that this change is itself responsible for much of the increase in the prioe of commodities, when- expressed ir terms of the currencies of all countries.I considerable part of the rise In prioos in Europe is due to this depreciation of gold but there is an additional depreciation due to excessive issues of paper currency.    The continual expansion of paper issues with its necessary consequence of continuously depreciating exchange prevents the grant of the commercial credits required by the , situation and thus fatally hampers the resumption of international commerce.It is essential to the recovery of Surope that&apos; the manufacture of additional paper money and Government credits should be brought to an end and this must be effected as soon as the war esjpendlture has been terminated.HTS-(6)    Excessive profit making, commonly known as profiteering, has IHG.resulted from the scarcity of goods.   Deflation,and a  check upon the continuous rise of prices will do much in itself to end the conditions that make profiteering possible.   Bnt it is essential, in order to obtain the co-operation of all olasses in the increase of production, that each Government should take such steps as are appropriate to the circumstances of its own people to assure and guarantee to the workers that the burdens that they are called upon by their effortsi J til...-. , *. ..... . *
RESTRICTION OF   (7)   Demobilisation has be$n effected by the powers&amp;OVERNME1JTEXPEM)TTtfRE*      represented at the Conference at a far speedier rate than could have been anticipated but hea-vY abnormal expenditure resulting from the war still requires to be met (particularly In (xmneotion with the restoration of the devastated areas).   Such charges must be regarded as part of the war burden but in order to stop the pro-cess of inflation and to start the process-of donation the necessary measures must be init$.ated by every country to balance recurrent Government expenditure-Jirithjnfftdjoriai Income and to begin at the earliest possible--meanent-^tha reduction of the floating debts.    The best remedy of all is that debts should be reduced out of resanue; but in s^ far as this is not possible, floating debts should be consolidated by means of long term loans^raised out af the savings ef the people, and it is out of the savings of the people-that any fresh capital expenditure must be provided.    The Governments:, here represented have under-taken the consideration of the measures required for this jcurpose.(8)      But private economy is not less urgent than economyKIVATEOQEOT^ORE,      in Government expenditure,,   It is only by means of frugalliving on the part of all classes of the nation that the capital oan be saved which is urgently required for the repair of war damage an/i for restoring efficiency to the equipment of industry upon which future&apos;production de-pends*   It is of the utmost importance that it should be brought home to every citizen In each country that just as Xn the war their private savings made available for the Government goods and services urgently&quot;needed for the4   &quot;VIK&apos; iprosecution of hostilities, so in the period of reconstruction-struct ion economy by -Individuals will reduce the cost of essential articles both for themselves and for theirt&apos; * . . ,&quot; ::\.y.efTorUfe^ta K[*w$ &amp; -*tre* vnM. *.ggrtfTO*ie&amp; ^ i3th6a.*y     -ta^ead^ exploit the economic difficult lea of Europe for their own personal ends.
\ follows, and will set free capital for the reconstruction of?     $ -i     .   their country and the restoration of the machinery of industrythroughout the world.UiLAPSE      (9)   Commercial intercourse, on the resumption of which the OFLCHANGBS., recovery of the world depdnds, is governed by the foreignexchanges and most of.the foreign exchanges have bee a toa greater or less extent disorganised during the pant year.The discount of European currencies on New York approximatelystands as follows:-Pound sterling 30- %Franc (Paris) 64-. %Franc (Brussels) 62. %Lire 72-. %Mark 96. %The state of the exchanges does not reflect the truefinancial situation of the countries concerned, providedtheir industrial life can be resumed.     It is in part theresult of depreciation in the purchasing power of theseveral currencies, but in part it results from the failureOf exports.    Many countries are temporarily dependent, onthe importation of food, raw material and other necessariesand are not in a position to export nearly sufficient tofurnish the requisite means of payment.     The result hasbeen severe competition for the very limited supply of bills of Exchange which has forced down the rate of exchange&quot;beysnd the point which properly represents the purchasing;power of currencies in-the buying and selling countries. Inthe degree in which rates of exchange aro so forced down, theprices of imports are forced up, and the prices of food an4raw material increased. The ultimate cure is to raise exportsto the requisite amount and this should be impressed on the trading communities affected, but it is not immediately possibleto increase exports sufficiently and unless steps are taken tofurnish a substitute the situation will rapidly become worse.It is therefore urgent to obtain a temporary balance of trade by means of commercial credits accompanied by the reduction ofall non-essential imports to an absolute minimum.
11FFT&amp;nTt/fJES.      (10) Attempts to manipulate the txohaagfta ir?merrt^ction will xmly retard ultimate rooovery.    HeajiwhUA means must be found to prevent the bre&amp;Jcdoim, xrt tradinf operatioma.    At the present moment, the Governments of Europe are not in a position to furnish more Government loans exoept to a very limited extent for the purpose of relieving extreme distress,- and State aid in this matter would be at the best entirely inadequatef     It is from the resumption.of commercial credits that the neeesaary means must be found for securing the interchange of the resources of the world, and the Conference is assured that such .&apos; credits will be forthcoming as soon as Governments have taken steps tp strengthen confidence in their commercial and financial policy^The Powers represented at the Conference recognise, however, the necessity of continued collaboration in this matter and they will continue to consult together regard-ing the provision and distribution of the necessary raw materials and foodstuffs with a view to the early resumption of nprmal conditions.They recognise further the special position of the devastated countries, and particularly of Prance, having regard to the widespread-devastation which her territory has suffered, the consequent diminution of her immediate resources, and the heavy capital expenditure which she must incur in restoring the damaged areas.    The restor-ation of the devastated areas is of primary importance to the reconstruction of Europe.They have also had under consideration the special position of Germany, where enterprise is at present para-lysed and the possibility of obtaining commercial credit closed, by reason of the fact that her obligations for . reparation are still totally unknown.    It is most desir-able, therefore, in the interests of the Allied Countries, no less than in, that of Germany, that at the earliest possible moment the total of the reparation payments to be made by Germany under the Treaty of Versailles should- u, K
Illbe fixed and that in accordancewrri-th the terms of&quot; tbe&quot;Treaty and the &quot;reply of the,Allied and Associated &quot;Powers to the German delegates elated the 16th June 1919, she should be enablectto obtain essential foodstuffs and raw materials, and, if necessary in the opinion of the Separation Commission should be allowed to raise abroad a loan to meet her immediate needs, of such amount and with such priority as the Reparation Commission may deem essential.     In the case of Austria, the Powers here rspre-sented recognise &quot;that even more^active assistance-may require to be given,(11)     The review weich the Conference has made of the situation indicates that the pre coss   of recovery of Europe must nece-ss-arily be a slot&quot; one, which cannot be expedited by short-cuts of any description.     It can, however, be most -seriously hampered, by the dislocation of production by strikes, lockouts and inter-ruptions of work of all kinds.     The civilization of Europe has indeed &quot;been shaken and set back, but it is far from being irretrievably ruined by the tremendous struggle through w-aich she has passed.     The restoration of her vitality now depends on the whole-hearted co-operation of all her children, who have! it in their own power to delay, or to accelerate the process of reconstruction.     It is the hope of every Government.that improved conditions of livelihood and. of employment may be assured to the workers.     To secure this result, each individual must contribute his best efforts to the restor-   -ation of his country.     Taking; the .Allied countries as a whole, the recovery of industry has beon remarkable *    Nearly eighteen months have passed since hostilities terminated; and. the reaction which necessarily followed the tense strain of the war in ar-ad-ually passing.     The citizens of every country ,are once aga/ih resuming the normal occupations of home life and in their renewed labours the Conference sees a clear sign of renewed prosperity.,
ftSUMMARY OF      (12)- In.view of the ab-oro o^X!lsXdoTO^t?lcalS^ i^-Srrxrcme-CONCLUSIONS^......lBrjnno.il, after .a careful survey of this vitally urgent problem in all its aspects, asmo upon the following recommendations with a view to tho amelioration of tho present economic, difficulties of Europe(1)   It is of paramount importance that peace oondi** tions should bo fully andLcompletely ro-Stored. at t&amp;e^j&amp;arli^ ost possible moment throughout tho world.    In order to achieve this object, it is desirable mm(a) That poaoe and normal Economic relations Should be re-established as soon as possi-ble throughout Eastern Europe.(b) That Armies should everywhere v* reduced to a peaoe &quot;footing, that arjiamon^is    ould bo limited to the lowost possi^^riguro oompatible with national security and that the League of Nations should be invited to consider, as soon as possible, proposals to ihis end:(c) Thai the States whioh havb been created or Enlarged as the result bf the War should at once re-ostablikh full and friendly co-operation, and arrange for the unrestricted interchange of commodities, in order that tho essential unity of European eoonomio lifo may not be impaired by the erection of artificial eoohomio barriers.(2)   Not only the Government of each country but all those engaged in the task of production in ovory land should..gj.vo Immediate attention to tho-&apos;execution of all measureswhich will contribute to tho full -resumption of peacefulindustry, to the encouragement c  bottor output on tho partof the workers in every country, to tho improvement ofmachinery and means of transportation, and tho removal ofsuch disturbing factors as profiteering.-d3*-

It will be possible to achieve this when the countries have made the reforms indioated in the foregoing paragraphs.
(ft)   The Powers represented at the OfinfwenjtKK.^the necessity for continued -oo-^^ratxon between the^Allles &quot; and for removing obstacles to the easy ^ijnrteroharige of essential commodities.   They will oontinue to o-oneTiltrt*)gei&amp;er&apos;J&apos; -regarding the provision and distribution of neoessary raw materials and  foodsvuffs with a view to the early restoration of. normal oonditions.(7)   The Powers represented at the Conferenoe have given careful attention to the special case of the devastated regions, and more particularly of Northern Prance.   The restoration of these areas is of primary importance for the re-establishment of the economic equilibrium of Europe and the resumption of normal, trade conditions.   It is, evident that the large sums required for   this purpose cannot be provided out   of current revenue nor can the work of restoration be postponed until the reparation due from Germany   under the Treaty of Peace   has been received.   Under these circumstances the Powers represented at the Conference recognise that the oapital sums required for this . restoration may properly be raised by market loans in anticipation of the reparation payments provided by the Treaty, and that the restrictions which they desire to see   placed on new borrowing do net apply to loans and credits raised for the purpose of meeting this abnormal oapital expenditure.(8)   The Powers   represented at the Conference have taken under consideration Article 2?5 and cognate articles of the Treaty of Versailles, and the passages in the letter addressed on the 16th June, 191&quot;, by the Supreme Oounoil to the German Peace. Delegates which contemplate that Germany shallmake14 A.

The Powers are agreed that it is desirable in the interest alike of Germany and of her creditors that the total to be paid by her for reparation 3hould be fixed at an early date.     They observe that under the protocol to the Treaty a period of four months from the signature of the Treaty was provided, during which Germany should have the right to make proposals of the .!rli?&amp; referred to, and they are agreed that in the c.i/ori,.c-:t.?nces as they exist to-day such period should bs extended.
