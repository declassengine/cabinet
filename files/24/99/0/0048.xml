BROMLEY ON REVOLUTION.......................... &quot; 13SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAIN ........................... &quot; 14IRELAND.............................................. &quot; 15SUMMARYThe rise in the cost of living, manufactured.il and prospective, has thrown all other questions suoh as nationalisation into the back-ground; the discontent among the wording classes and the general public on this account can scarcely be exaggerated.   Demands for higher wages, which inevitably follow a rise in prioes, are less insistent than the cry for drastic steps to prevent and punish profiteering in high places.   It is very unfortunate that at a time when the workers were beginning to show signs of settling down they should be provided with a legitimate ground for fresh agitation.Closely connected with the rise in priors is the congestion at the docks, of whioh particulars are given in this Report.   That part of the problem, at least, ought not to be beyond solution.l*or the present evidence is against a general strike on Nationalisation, a matter on which the miners themselves are divided, but the possibility of seotional strikes in districts where the extremists are powerful cannot entirely be ignored,   The virus of nationalisation has infected the seamen; the railwayraen are not unanimous in favour of such a scheme.The present trend of Labour is towards public enquiries such as that now sitting under Lord Shaw.  Workers in the woollen trade are now discussing the advantages of suoh an enquiry and there is general talk of an enquiry upon the &quot;fodder basis&quot; of wages.The open contributions to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Development iFund amount to less than If4 per trade unionist.With the exception of a small band of fanatios Sinn Feiners generally are said to favour Home Rule on the Dominion basis.
NATIONALIZATION OF TH3 MINESThe date of the special Trade Union Congress has been definitely fixed for March 11th.    Amongst the great mass of trade unionists the view is undoubtedly gaining ground that a general or a sectional strike on the political question would be disastrous to the movement.    It is stated that the miners1 leaders have agreed not to call a strike if the Congress vote against direct aotion, ana the discussion will probably be free - a double-edged advantage -for while it would not, on the one hand, bind the Congress to the acceptance or rejection of a definite resolution, it leaves the field open for the introduction of questions such as prices and wages,,on which opinion is far more decided than on nationalization.I give at some length the reports received from my correspondents, as they have very carefully, investigated local feeling.My Birmingham correspondent writes:&quot;The campaign, so far as this area is concerned, appears to have been conducted for the sole benefit of the minere, no attempt having been made to place the cjuestion &quot;before the general public.&quot;The average man in, the street is not. however, interesting himself in the present day schemes of the miners1 leaders and there is no popular demand amongst the working class in this district for the nationalization of the mines.&quot;Tho recent speech of the Prime Minister in the House on this matter, in which he defines the Governments polioy, has stiffened the conviction of many that any further interference in Industrial matters toy the Government would not be to the welfare of the&quot;community.  Regarding the threat of Direct Action, the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks in answer to Mr. Lunn have given general satisfaction; the local labour pxjess states that it was the latter&apos;s speech whioh gave Mr. Lloyd George his text, and skilful use was made of it.&quot;My/
My Liverpool correspondent writes:&quot;As far as&apos; tho public are concerned, in 3Jancashire they don&apos;t seem to take much interest in the question, but the majority of those who do express an opinion are dead against nationalization.&quot;The miners in this area, although in favour of nationalisation., kivealways taken the vie?; that strike action should be avoided if at all possible and there is nothing like 30 much talk of a strike in Wigan and district as there was even a week ago,&quot;The miners know the &quot;Mines for the flation&quot; campaign has not been the success it was expected to be so far as educating public opinion in its favour is concerned.&quot;A regular attendant at miners&apos; meetings in Wigan says that the Lancashire and Cheshire Executive will never sancti a strike whatever is done in other parts of the country.   He thinks that the deadlock will.be solved by constitutional methods.In Leeds, the agitation for nationalization has subside and the general view seems to be against direct action. There, have been large secessions from union membership since the last striken -   ,- -In South Wales the feeling of the miners is stronger and the extremistsvof the South Wales Unofficial Reform Committee are talking1 of seizing upon a strike as an opportunity for setting up Soviets in every town in Wales. They say that agreements have been made with provision shops and Co-operative Societies about the food supply, and that the miners-hove&quot;been1advised to stock their cellars for a long fight.   Force is to be met by force in the form of raids, and,the soldiers are to be invited not to shoot.   In other words, &quot;The rank and file will teke commend,&quot;On the other hand, in Glasgow there seems to be a feeling that Mr. Smillie is playing the(dictator, and the miners seem disposed&quot;tV) resent bis decrees.The/
U1The following circular is &quot;believed to have beenissued to lodges by the Cleveland Miners1 :nd Qur,rrymenT3Association:&quot;Your officials have carefully considered this question, and feel that they would be lacking in their duty to the members if they did not give expression to their opinions, and thereby give a lead in such an important matter.&apos; They believe it would be a great mistake to declare a national strike or act in any way along imconstitution?.l lines.&quot;The question of nationalisation is one that csa only be decided by Parliament, and the country would have an opportunity to decide on the question through the ballot box, though it may for a time be delayed. In the meantime the question should be thoroughly discussed by meetings throughout the country.&quot;PROFITEERINGMy correspondents have been somewhat at a loss adequately to describe the ill feeling aroused by rising-prices.   I quote a typical report from Liverpool;&quot;These last few days the workers in our area have been absolutely seething with unrest over the continued and expected further rise in the cost of food and other commodities.&quot;Everybody is talking about the rise in the price of tobacco, expected rise in price of butter, sugar, rice, clothing, postal rates.&quot;The position is regarded as getting intolerable. Already the workers are talking of fresh wages demands but the prospect of obtaining these does not give much satisfaction, because they know that these concessions will only further aggravate the cost of living and leave them no better off in the long run.&quot;There is no doubt of the serious view the workers take of this problem.&quot;There is evidence everywhere that the workers and the public generally are getting exasperated at the constant rise in the price of food and other&apos; commodities aiid trouble i3 certain unless something is done quickly to remedy the present state of affairs.&quot;Everybody is convinced that profiteering is rampant and tho Profiteering Act is generally looked upon as a farce.&quot;The public think something could be done at once to put      effectual check on the huge profits being made by combines and individual firms at the expense of the public-Another report from Newcastle indicates the remedies proposed by the workers:
&quot;I heard the matter discussed by various groups of workmen who used very strong expressions recording, sens, suggesting thr.t the Governrieiit should seize their factories and imprison the directors.   They would describe an incident whereby a small retailer would be fined for over-charging and yet nothing is being done to this firm, who have been declared profiteers and who have ms.de millions in profits.&quot;The majority of the working class believe that money is being organised for the monopoly of various things, and that it is time the Government stepped in and checked the activities of Trusts.&quot;If the Government were only to take immediate action to prevent the rise of prices of articles which are controlled by these large groups, such as tobacco, the working man would feel that at least something was being done to prevent him from being exploited and would thus go a long way towards preventing the advanco of the programme put forward by the extremists.&quot;It is current topic amongst all the workmen that the only way to meet those demands of high prices is to ask and press for higher wages.&quot;My Leads correspondent reports that in practicallyevery trade union branch meeting room in hi3 area, thereis agitation for increases of pay to meet tho risingcost of living;   at these meetings it is now the custom tohave ready the particulars of the profits and dividendsof firms.Amongst tho tailoring trades in tho J&amp;feared Bad the rise in the price of cotton has produced a profound effect and a demand for higher wages is shortly to be formulated.EXTREMISTS OH THE DEMiCEMy Leeds correspondent reports that, owing to the Prime Minister1&quot; fearless attack on nationalization, the treatment of discharged men by the Unions&quot;, Mr. ftinston churchill&apos;s recent speeches, the allegations regarding the impeding of housing schemes by the slackness of the workers, and of course Lab;)urTa defeats at Ashton, Wrekin and Paisley, the local extremists, who for the last twelro months have been attaoking and denouncing everybody and everything, are now laboriously trying to defend theircharacter
m    5    &quot;*.  character,   They have a difficult task as ray correspondent reports that the thousands of people who reed the Sunday papers, all of which contain anti-Lnbour propaganda, far outweigh -the handful of those who come and listen to revolutionary speeches.Torn Myers, M,P,, &apos;speaking at Dewsbury, rather bitterly and sarcastically reBented the attempt to lecture labour from the Ministerial Benches, especially over the discharged men and the Unions.   Myers said he had that day been reading the Board of Trade Labour Gazette and saw that 40,000 men of the building trade had registered as unemployed, yet in face of this the Government had the effrontery to charge the Unions with not admitting discharged men into this already overflowing trade.It is interesting to see that Labour, which has been treated as a hothouse plant for so many years, behaves like other hothouse plants; when suddenly put out into the cold air of criticism its petals curl up.CONGESTION AT THE DOCKS       -    .:The congestion at the London Docks is producing a feeling of exasperation among the dockers that must not be ignored. They assign every kind of reason for the congestion - some obvious, some fanciful - but one and all seem to be convinced that a ring of speculators is holding up the meat for a higher price.   This is not surprising in view of the patent facts that there is a glut of frozen meat; that in spite of there being more meat in the country than before the war the price is higher than it has ever been;   that preference is given to meat ships from the Argentine; that enormous demurrage rotes are being paid on ships that have been lying in the river forweeks/
weeks waiting their turn,- and that thousands of willing hands are thrown out of work because there are no means of handling the cargoes because of the congestion.   &quot;Something has got to be done&quot;, they say, &quot;or we must have a revolution&quot;.   One man employed in a grain shed, now converted into a refrigerator, stated that the mice attracted to the shed by the&apos;grain were now building their nests in the carcases and that they had developed a kind of Arctic fur to protect themselves from tho cold.After lying for some days in the river a few ships have been diverted to other ports, but this does not empty the refrigerators.   This problem ought not to be beyond solution, If a sliding scale of charges fails to induce importers to remove their goods from the docks, it may prove to be worth spending a considerable sum in commandeering the stocks of meat and issuing it at a -reduced price to the consumer, for at a lower price the consumption of meat in the poorer family wou^d certainly increase. - There would be a set-off in the saving cf demurrage and motor lorries might be used to accelerate distribution.   Any whole-hearted attempt by the Government to lower the price of necessaries would restore the public confidence,ATTENDANCES AT MEETINGSIt is reported that b% more members are present at Trade Union,branch meetings than was the case before the war.   It is now estimated to be about 22$ of the&apos;total membership.   Of the habitues of these meetings the majority are young and advanced socialists.   Even when important questions like wages or hoursof/
of work are up for discussion a representative meeting is seldom obtained.   Some Unions invite lecturers to speak after the business is over, but great difficulty is often found to get the men to stay and hear them.   They make for the nearest public house and informally discuss their branch.business there, &quot; Many think that their obligations to their Unions are finished when they have elected their delegate; the rest i3 his business.   The average worker is far more concerned about the cost of living, which includes beer and tobacco, than the question of nsitionalization, and if he knew that in the event of nationalization his responsibilities, which he could not delegate, wuld be Increased, he would quickly change his views.   When nationalization is discussed the advocates are always ready to put their case, whereas the opponents are silent.In discussing the attendances at meetings my Leeds correspondent states that only about 10$ of the people are capable of taking an intelligent interest in such questions as Russia; of these about 8$ favour the Bolsheviks.THE OQ-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT AND TRADE unions is a special Co-operative Congress met at Blackpool on February 12th and 15th and established a Parliamentary Committee.   It&apos;was decided to appoint a full time Executive of the Central Board for providing &quot;propaganda, legal assistance and co-operative education and defence.&quot;As an illustration of the temper of the present officials of the Co-operative Union a speech delivered on February 10th by Mr, Burt Williams, who was&apos;presented by the Railwayman with a,medal for his services during the railway strike, maybe/
tm    Q   aabe cited:-&quot;George Lansbury is in Russia and we should he doing here what they are doing in that country,   They have got the people off their backs and v/e should do the same,   I want a revolution, but we want no bloodshed here.   We can do without that.   Labour and Co-operators must get together,   We have set up Join Advisory, Boards and they have completed their arrangements, whioh will be presented to the next Co-operative Conference,   In future we shall be in the position to guarantee that any strike we may undertake must be successful,   By our system of banking we have lent out 300,000 to 600,000 in short-dated securities,   These can be called in quickly to accommodate the strike and will ensure its success. Labour must triumph,&quot;TEE FEELING AMONGST EX-SERVICE MBSDiscontent is still rife at Woolwich and meetings have been held every day during the last week under the chairmanship of Councillor Earry Hart, who was at one time connected with the Sailors&quot;, Soldiers1 and Airmen^ Union and who presented, a petition to Princess Mary on February 2.1st,   Strong language was used at a demonstration in Beresford Square on February 22nd, when the Government was denounced as &quot;the greatest pack of rogues who ever disgraoed the Government benches.&quot;   It was then stated that unless their demands were conceded in the meantime the men were going in foroe to Doming Street on torch 1st, leaving the Arsenal at 5.30 p,m.   Councillor Hart has been boasting in the Labour Club that if they have to go to Whitehall again, they will see the Prime Minister &quot;no matter what it*costs,&quot;Reports indicate that the extremist National Union of Ex-Service Men is making headway in various parts of the country.   To counteract its influence in South Wales efforts, are being made to bring about an immediate amalgamation.of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers and the Comrades of thieGreat/
Great War,   It had been decided to postpone the amalgamation until June, but there is a strong desire, especially in Monmouthshire, that this decision should.be reversed.Ex-Private Simmonds secured a unanimous vote of the Birmingham Central Labour Party, in favour of &quot;back pay&quot;, in accordance with the programme of the union,A Bradford Branch of the National Union of Ex-ServiceMen has been established &quot;ander the auspices of the Independent Labour Party.In Glasgow, the Ex-Service Men&apos;s organisations have formed a Collective Council to represent their interests and a meeting i3 being arranged early In March to demand that the Pension Circular Ho. 204 be rescinded.   This Circular is very unpopular, because it withholds the allowances until the Medical Referee&apos;s recommendation has been sanctioned by an officer who has had no opportunity of seeing the applicant.MAY LAY CELEBRATIONSmmmwm-m ***** rmm*m muni mw       w-Great efforts are being made to make the May4 Lay Celebrations throughout the country a success.   The Labour Party Executive,has invited the Trades Unions to take the necessary steps and the Co-operative Association in London is to join.   There is to be the usual procession, followed by a &quot;monster&quot; demonstration in&apos;Hyde Park, and a meeting is to be held in the Albert Hall. , The moving spirit is Mr. Burt Williams, whose speech is quoted above.   It seems probable &apos;  that many workers will absent themselves from work, with or without leave./;::.. May Lay celebrations in France are regarded with some apprehension and it is possible, though not probable, that the celebrations in England may result in disorder, such as a march on Downing Street or Buckingham Palace.       .THE/
THE POLICE STRIKERSThe officials of the National Union of Police and Prison Officers are still organising energetically and say that they have received  20,000 to further their cause. On February 22nd it was stated at Hoxton that a number of police had rejoined the Union and were subscribing to the funds.   This has not been&apos; verified.Hayes states that he has been invited to stand as a Borough Councillor for a St. Paneras ward and that-he will contest a constituency at the next general election,Marston is still addressing meetings in the Newcastle area, but has not been very successful,Another attempt to appoint Councillor Burden (a police striker) to the Liverpool Watch Committee was defeated by 53 votes to 23,THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYThe dissensions which are agitating the Independent .Labour Party will probably reach a climax at the annual conference, which will be held in Glasgow on April 4th, 5th and 6th,   Apart from the resolutions demanding affiliation with the Third (Moscow) International, which will probably \ the test question at the conference, there are six whioh refer to the relations between the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Party,  Woolwich and the City of London branches demand an enquiry into &quot;the programme, policy and organisation of the Independent Labour Party in the light o recent industrial and political developments.&quot;It seems dear that Mr, Ramsay Macdonald ana his colleagues will have to fight hard for the retention of the leadership.   Even in the Aberavon distriot, for which be ha just been chosen Parliamentary candidate, Mr, Maodonald-1 s course will not be plain sailing, for the local miners arecomplaining/
&quot;u- 165complaining that tho nominations wore closed before they had had an opportunity of putting forward a candidate.In Glasgow the Independent L&amp;bour Party is reported to be the most active of the political parties; it holds an average of nine meetings eaqh week-end, and draws audienoes of from 500-1000. My correspondent adds, however, that the audiences consist frequently of the same people, who have nothing else to do on Sundays.The prinoipal plank in the Independent labour Party platform at the moment is condemnation of the Peace Treaty. By a somewhat obscure line of reasoning, the speakers lay the fluctuating exchange at the door of the Treaty.The Ashton Labour Party is very much upset by the defeat of their candidate.   The general view is that if Mr. Robinson had been a man of less extreme views, he would have been successful; the workers think that his ambiguity and the help whioh he received from rabid cranks were the chief causes of his defeat.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;from Sovember, 1919, until Mr. Lanshury went to Russia, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Development Fund has been-placed prominently before trades unionists by every available means, including expensive propaganda tours.   It seems likely that all the money received from untainted sources has been acknowledged in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and an examination of the files gives the following amounts, with . the dates on which the announcements appeared in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;: 1919fo?T 24th   Norwich Boot and Shoe Operatives      .  50.

It must be added that the amount realised by all the &quot;Christmas Box&quot; collections does not appear;   assuming, however, that it brings the total invested or given to  31,000, the contribution per trade unionist is less than there is information, not yet verified, that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reoeived a sum of Soviet money through Theodore Rothstein and that Mr. Lansbury was in treaty with the representative of the Soviet Government to receive a considerable sum for the support of his paper.   However this may be, it is most unlikely that he will return from Russia without funds; indeed, there is good reason for believing that his real object in going to Moscow was to obtain them.MR. BROMLEY ON REVOLUTION ......A significant admission was made by Mr. J. Bromley, Scoretary of the Associated. Society of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen and prospective Parliamentary candidate for the -Att&amp;cliffe Division, at Sheffield on February 22nd.   He said that the British people had not been hungry enough  or oppressed enough to make a revolution successful.   The suggestion or theory of revolution, of force, in this oountry would be absolutely unsuccessful in the present circumstances,Direot/
Direct action might, however, he worthy of consideration in the future, if not now.   He believed the best course to be education on socialistic lines.   Socialism was feared because it was not understood, and persuasive enlightenment was preferable to a &quot;wordy bludgeone&quot;SIM Egg Iff BRITAIN*       Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the recent Albert Hall meeting for the Self-Determination of Ireland was the absence of Labour extremists either on the platform or in the hall.   It was also significant that the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which never misses an opportunity of fostering subversive movements, was silent about this meeting.   In fact, the extremists must have received a rebuff from the Sinn Fein organisers.   Art 0&apos;Brien, who presided at the meeting, has double pneumonia and Is not expected to recover; even if he does, he is unlikely to resume his old position as secret gun-runner for the Sinn Seiners.There is a split in Glasgow owing to the election on February 8th of Sean MaeLoughlin.as President of the Irish Labour Party.   On February 20th he said that he &quot;was out for rebellion in Ireland and, if he oould manage it, in *Scotland as well,&quot;Up correspondent hears that the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Labour Party and the Gaelio Associations kare discussing plans for the contemplated rising on April 5th,It is proposed to transfer the Sinn Fein headquarters from Manchester to London, where St. Patrick1?? Day is to be celebrated.  Subscriptions, however, are not coming in and it has been decided to make a monthly levy.My correspondent, who has been making some enquiries about the Irish Movement in South Wales, reports that thereare/
are about 5,000 Irish born residents in Cardiff and 30,000 to ,35,000 people of Irish lineage.   The strongest branch of the Irish Self-Do^ermination League is.at Swansea and has ,480 members; there are two branches at Cardiff, numbering 350. :nd 25,, and another is^ about to be ,? i ,. formed.,. .... -At Ms.esteg the branch of the Ancient Order of Ribernirns numbers, some 300 and at Ne^ort. about 280.   At . Denials, where, there ,are thousands of Irish people, the branch has .onjy7aboixt ,100 members; this is partly due to . . the.fact that.the Irish declined to oontinue association with the Independent Labour Party and, in consequence, lost twor-jbhir^ls of ,its membership.  At Merthyr Tydfil there is a branch,of 90 members and, at Pontypridd one o f 100.   &quot; Branches are shortly to be formed at Abertiliery and . Mountain Ae&quot;h9   At the last named the United Irish League has strong local support, as the secretary is an official of thB Penrhi^ceiber Lodge of; the.

The extremist miners see possibilities,for the extension of their activities inthe Irish movement, but are nonplussed by the secrecy of* 1the Sinn feiners.;,IRELAND       :       &apos; : Vt-*i/.i.        &apos; -1&quot; *............ iThere was no improvement to observe during the past week in the state of the provinces, which, with the exception of North&apos; East Ulster, remain in a most lawless and unsatisfactory condition.   Before the close of the week some si xty outrages,* many of whi ch were of a serious nature, had&apos; &apos;* &quot; ;;    &apos;v- -been/
- 16 -been reported; the greater part of these were either attributable directly to the Sinn Fein movement, especially the Irish Volunteers, or to the state of iawlessn&amp;sa to which that movement has reduced the country.   Over twenty of these offences were raids for arms.There were a number of instances where&apos;the families of young men suspected of beooming candidates for the Royal Irish Constabulary have been intimidated and a state of terror now exists in most localities wliich&apos;renders the task of attempting to procure evidence well nigh hopeless.Through the Irish Volunteers, or Irish Republican Army as it is now termed, the Sinn Feiners are conducting a sort of guerilla warfare in a great part of the provinces and it is almost impossible to tell in what locality the next of these sporadic attacks on police barracks may take place. Apart from this there is no open activity, and ail Volunteer plans are laid with great secrecy.As has been suspected for some time $as^V t&amp;6re is Utt distinction now between Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Brotherhood.   The latter body has issued a secret circular deolaring that members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood may take the Oath of fidelity to Dai! Eireann and that every member of the Iri3h Republican Brotherhood who is physically fit should join the^ Irish Republican Army.The police and military continue to search houses and seize a quantify of arms and seditious,literature all over the provinces, but the Royal Irish.Constabulary, is greatly handicapped by its reduced numbers and, the necessity for protecting all barracks at night.      , . , r.An analysis of the number, of men arrested to those wanted shows a very high percentage.

It is, however, opposed to the attempted industrial boycott of Ulster.   Orders were issued by the Irish Executive on 21st instant for the police to seize this issue wherever found.The current issue of &quot;The Watchword of Labour&quot; is principally occupied with the recent Albert Hall Meeting in London, which it gives at great length under the heading -&quot;The Irish in London want the Republic recognised&quot; - &quot;Griffith flays Sir John Taylor&quot;.  Much of this paper is frankly Bolshevist in tone and, -for the eighth,time, its issue i3 now being seized wherever found.Matters are fairly quiet as regards Labour.   Small strikes, continue to break out and collapse, or yield to oompromiso, but wages as well as prices still tend upwards, and the increasing cost of the necessaries of life is causing discontent and undoubted hardship in the towns.   &quot;The Watchword&quot; admits that the recent motor strike ended in defeat and at the same time admits the political aspect of the strike by declaring, &quot;Defeat was inevitable from the beginning unless the British Government in Ireland could be shattered.&quot;Little or no interest ia manifested in the Governments Home Rule proposals.
