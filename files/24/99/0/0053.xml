(This Document is the Property ofHis gritaiinic Majesty&apos;3 government.)5 174&amp;JJ Sales of industrial businesses and the y     writinr; up of Capital with special rofer-ence to Cotton Mills,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Kioro is a common maunderstandin^ with regard (a) to the high dividends that are no?; bein^ paid (6) tho writing up of capital and (o) salo of bus Liaises at enhanced values.    This can ho removed by a simple illustration.Suppose prices ffono rally havo doubled, that is to sa,^T that&quot; the purchasing power of money has been reduced to a half.    Then other &quot;things bein  equal, a producing business can pay twice the old dividend&apos;, just as it can pay twice the&quot;old wages,    If it -previously paid 10 per cont it&apos; can now pay .20 *oer cent.    And&quot; just as twice the old wag&apos;es mean ho more&quot; to the workman m what tho wa^es will buy, so twice the old dividend means no more to shareholders, because each pound buys only half as much as&apos;before,    But these obvious considerations notwithstanding-, there is a prevalent disposition today to regard increased dividends, even.%if they are no more than sufficient to t. make up for the *riso in prices, as a proof of profiteering-.Writing1 ivo capital 100 per cent restores the eld dividend of 10&quot; per&quot; cent, but, as it is paid on twice the capital, the real position is the same as it was before. The doubling&apos; of nominal capital is apt to bo regarded as an exploitation of the public, but clearly it meanst no more than bringing the valuation of the capital-(which earns onlv as much as before in real things) into line with the new,scale of nominal values.Again, if a man sells his business for twice the old value, ho gets no&apos; more in purchasing power than ho wouid have received if ho had sold for the old value when general prices were at the old level.Indeed, as a matter of fact, the owner oftplant which is fairly old is &quot;Prejudiced by the rise in values,, because his depreciation fund will be insufficient for complete replacement at the new level&apos;of values if he continues paying into it at the old rate.    In the case of plant that&quot;needs early replacement, the whole of the earnings of capital in tho interveniiVY period mi^ht even prove insufficient to make up the needful sum..&apos;0n the other hand, it should be no tod that those who sell their industrial interests now and put their money into terminable loans repayable at par, will (--ain when the- value of monov rises (&quot;that is when prices fall)./in
in fact they axe speculating on the ohance of a fall in values. - It&apos;is partly because this is a tempting speculation that an exceptionally high rate of profit is needed in times like these to induce people to put their capital into business and keep it there.   l&apos;oo drastic an attempt to limit profits might consequently have disastrous results.   Prom the industrial point of view,, the difficulty of getting money to-day.-for State and Municipal loans is a healthy sign..In no industry have the writing up of capital and the sale of businesses gone farther than in the cotton industry But  fr no-f a few of these cases there is a fear.that the effect of the recent remarkable prosperity in the cotton industry has not been adequately discounted in reckoning the new nominal capital.   In so far as this fault lias been committed, dopression will be intensified when the boom is over.Previously, booms in the cotton industry have resulted mainly in the rapid erection of new mills.   But the present very high building and machinery costs, combined with the difficulty of getting building done and securing machinery, have deflected enterprise into the acquisition of existing undertakings, and apparently littlo actual extension is taking place.   Sales increased greatly in number about 3eptomber, and still continue!^,   transactions are chiefly in respect of spinning mills though a number of mills engaged in both spinning and weaving havs been sold.   Pow of the sales up to the present relate to weaving mills alone,   It is estimated that about the beginning of February 160 mills had changed hands out of a total of about 1,000*   Kris represents tho sale of some 12 million spindlesj or approximately one fifth of the total spindleage of Lancashire and the surrounding districts,ilhe prices given range from throo or four &quot;to more than a doaon timos the nomi-H al&apos;value of the shares, six or eight times being common,   The chief explanation of the extremely high prioos in certain cases is that a very large proportion of tho oapital was in the form&apos;of loans and debentures bearing a low rate of interest, which, of course, rendered the ordinary share capital proportionately more remunerative after the depreciation of values.It may be estimated that a valuation of the plant and machinery of tho mills on the )?asls of present-day costs would give a &quot;figure &quot;nearly if not quite tlir.ee timos the pre-war figure,   Thus, there is some Justification for writing up tho nominal valuo of undertakings, and for issuing bonus&quot;&quot; sharos in respect of increased capital valuo; but this policy is bound to have inconvenient consequences&quot;when the inevitable reaction from the present boom takes place.It would bfe impossible to estimate without a very detailed analysis of figures, which are not available, the extent to which the mills which have boon changing hands are now over-capitalised. -Bat, when the inevitable reaction occurs those which are ovorecapitalised will be in difficulties with their shareholders in comparison with those Which have pursued a more conservative policy.   5&apos;or this reason, among others the Trade Unions concerned view/the
the present movement with considerable alarm;   they fear lest thev low dividends resulting from over capitalisation should cauBO pressure on wages and effect detrimentally the maintenance of oapital equipment.The writing up of oapital now to the level of present valuoe will nocessitato its writing down a*ain after prices have fallen -but it is unlikoly that tho same do^ree of writing down will be nooded, as it is most improbable that prioe3 will subside to their old level, or anything near tho old level.    No doubt the inevitable writing down will also be popular&apos;ly misunderstood, and there is a-fear that on this account alone thoro will be a tendenoy to trade depression when lower prices cause lower nominal dividends.   There wiil be a oommon impression that businesses have booome unprofitable though, as a matter of faot, in respect of the purchasing power of their earnings, thoy may be just as profitable as before, and thejr will have the advantage of gaining on depreciation account in so : far as they reolconed depreciation on a soalo commensurate with high prioos and invested the proceeds in such a way as not to suffer from the fall in values.    But the short-sighted publio who have sold in the trough and bought on the erect will naturally lose.A.C.Gedd00.26th february, 1920,
