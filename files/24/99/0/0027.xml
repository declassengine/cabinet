HwtM mpijmm I&quot; EHi* xROPJLM1! OF HIS brimmg Mhfl&amp;CT^ WB^SKM:,)CONFIDENTIAL..0.1,727,Copy isle.the   FQkaafl i kxchangeo,(Circulated for information ir connection with the decision of the Supreme Council on February, 23rd 1920. J.The War left the chief European countries (a) flooded with paper money, (b) short of raw materials and foodstuffs; and (c) with their manufacturing industries concentrated upon production for the purposes of the war.Consequently, other things being eoual, the exchanges of the paperusing countries had to fall to a new par with the countries whose currencies were still effectively based on gold.During the war the policy of &quot;pegging&quot; the Exchanges was adopted.   Shis was invaluable as a war measure, but it involved the continued increase in Europers debt to  merles and other neutrals, while it represented essentially a subsidy on imports. It was neoesssry to abandon this method, of maintaining the foreign value of European currency soon after it became clear that hostilities were not likely to be resumed.   The result was a prompt and rapid fall in European currencies, especially in New York.At the tiiEe when the inflation of European currency was first really being felt in the foreign money markets, it was necessary to replenish diminished stocks of raw materials and foodstuffs at almost any cost, while the purchasing countries were not able to resume their export trade on a large scale, until they had bought in raw materials.   The effect of this ie shown tyr the following particulars of visible imports and exports from trance, Italy and Great Britain for various periods:-Perlod. Exports.                     Imports.France (first nine Fr.4, 81t),&apos;45&apos;sf &amp;O0. :.,.. Fr,20,773,863,000 months - 1919)Italy (First seven JL   2,164,866,000   ...

Of the British imports 45$ were classed as food, drink and tobacco, and 40^ as raw materials or partly manufactured goods, These proportions in all probability roughly hold good in the case-of the other countries, and are sufficient to justify the claim that far the greater part of the imports consisted of goods and materials necessary for the restoration of normal economic life, Bat even after including &quot;invisible exports&quot;, which in the case of Breat Britain probably amounted to some  520,000,000, there is a -wide gap between imports and exports, which must be met by the provision of credits in the exporting countries, or by the offer by the purchasers of currency which is already redundant and must fall heavily in value, as the amount on the market increases.Fortunately the export trade of Europe has shown signs of great vitality.   In the first eleven months of 1919 there were imported into the United States goods from France worth $ 107,000,000 as against 0 56,000,000 in 1918&quot;   Italy      &quot;    $   52,000,000 ,f &quot; 23,000,000   &quot;     &quot;&quot; (Great      &quot;    $ 267,000,000 &quot; &quot; $140,000,000   &quot;     &quot; Britain)In Great Britain exports rose from  55,800,000 per month in the first six months of 1919 to  105,900*000 in January 1920.   But on the whole there is still a serious adverse balance, except possibly in the case of Great Britain, and so long as this is so, European currencies will remain depressed in exchange beneath their present reduced par. and indeed will continue to fali.It is this depression which in the main operates as a bounty on export.   Wages and other Costs have already or will Soon have adapted themselves to the new par which is measured by the difference between home paper prices and gold priOes,The collapse in the exchanges is due.(a) to the depreciation of paper currency and (b) to the adverse balance of trade, arising from the abnormal import requirements of European countries.In the case df Great Britain it is hoped that the total foreign trade in 1920 will show a favourable trade balance.   But so far as Europe is given means of utilising the Anglo-       ^ American Exchange, this Exchange must be forced down below it$ true present&apos; par.In the case of France and Italy it can hardly be expected that there will beffavourable trade balance in 1920. But that part of the continued fall in the value of francs and lire which is due to oontinued depreciation of paper currency should cease so soon as the revenue accounts of the&amp;e oountries balance and it is unnecessary to print further notes to meet inflation of credit.   An earlier date cannot be fixed for the cessation of depreciation.The
The elimination of depreciation as a factor would leave the present abnormal import, requirejfcatft^ as&quot;1ihe only^faxrtor pxeveniLing^ the restoration of an equilibrium.    he situation would then be easier to handle.England can only help, even through credits given in the course of business, to a limited extent.   Further help can only be given at the e xpense of a collapse of her exchanges. America alone has adequate means and by the passing of the Edge Bill, authorising the establishment of foreign trading corporations (which, however, have no state guarantee) assistance from meat source has been facilitated.A.Os.Gr,*President of the Board of Trade.25th February, 1920.*&quot; 3 *&quot;
