^Tj n * ASECRET.   hisdrissi io 31/    yjuiiir^WyOLUTIOHARIES MD THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION (Circulated by the Home Secretary).000l desire to oall the attention of my colleagues to a Report&apos;by Sir Basil Thomson whioh I circulated some weeks ago.    In this Report Sir Basil Thomson points out the success attained by the Bolshevists outside Russia by means of propaganda.     &quot;During their two years of power&quot;,   he says, &quot;the Bolsheviks &quot;have achieved a great deal!   they nearly caused revolutions in Switzerland &quot;and Holland on Armistice Day;   they did cause a short-lived revolution in &quot;Winnipeg;   they held for a time the Capital of Bavaria, and for some months &quot;Hungary waB in their power.    They are raising Central Asia against Europeans, &quot;they are training emissaries for India, and they are in correspondence with &quot;the extreme party among the Sinn Peiners in Ireland,    All this they have done &quot;in two years, not by foroe of arms but by the cheaper and more effeotive &quot;method of underground propaganda.     That their doctrines have not taken wide &quot;hold in England, France or the United States is owing not only to the good &quot;sense of the people and the national stability of their institutions, but &quot;rather to the difficulty in sending propagandists and literature while the &quot;blockade continued.&quot; &apos;&quot;With this danger before our eyes, and notwithstanding the example of &quot;the special Anti-Revolutionary Legislation found necessary in Canada and the &quot;United States, it is still not illegal in England to advocate the abolition &quot;of Parliament and the setting up of Soviet Government, to circulate Bolshevik &quot;literature, to accept money from abroad for revolutionary agitation, and to be &quot;a secret representative of the Russian Soviet Government, provided that one &quot;does not advocate acts of violence or armed rebellion;   at least if it is &quot;technically illegal there is no risk of prosecution,    The anomaly is more &quot;striking when it is remembered that the Soviet authorities openly advocate &quot;and commit acts whioh are ordinary orimes&apos; in this Country,     Putting aside &quot;the murders perpetrated by the &quot;Extraordinary Commission&quot;, they advocate the &quot;destruction of the capitalistic system by a wide circulation of forged notes. &quot;When the &quot;White&quot; troops entered Odessa they seized a huge number of forged &quot;Bank of England  5 and Treasury  1 notes;   in one bundle alone there were &quot;20,000 forged  5 notes, of which specimens are now in the Bank of England, &quot;This is part of their deolarod plan to destroy the value of money and so &quot;abolish capitalism.    The Soviet Government is. therefore, accessory to a &quot;crime punishable by penal servitude in England.    On October 9th, 1919 - three &quot;days after the settlement of the railway strike - the Soviet Government Wire-Mless transmitted a message, put into the mouth of the Railwaymen of &quot;Rod &quot;Petrograd&quot;&quot;British railwaymen you have deolnred a general strike, but&quot;this is not enough...........    You must pass from a general; &quot;strike to an armed rising.&quot;&quot;The senders of this message individually would be liable to prosecution &quot;in England, yet without legislation we shall be allowing their emissaries to &quot;enter this Country and put into foroe their declared criminal intentions with &quot;entire impunity.    It is true that there are provisions in the Defenoe of the &quot;Realm Regulations under whioh an offender might have been prosecuted ouiraaarilv,
&quot;but theso Regulations will shortly lapse and when trade intercourse with &quot;Russia is resumed the opportunity whioh the Bolsheviks have been waiting &quot;for will have come.&quot;The Report then gives full details regarding the &quot;Third International&quot; in Holland whose avowed aims are &quot;the overthrow of capitalism&quot;, &quot;the abolition -tion of Parliamentary Government&quot;, and &quot;the disarming of the bourgeoisie and the arming of the workers&quot;;   regarding its meetings in Holland whioh were attended by representatives from this Country?   and regarding the efforts made in this Country to combine the extreme Socialist parties in a &quot;United Communist Party&quot;, affiliated to the Third International.Sir Basil Thomson concludes by recommending legislation on the lines of that in foroe in Canada and of the law passed by the Senate of the United States.His proposals are -1.    Any person who either orally or by writing, printing, exhibiting or circulating written or printed words, or otherwise shall inoite or en-courage the violent or sudden overthrow of the constituted Government of the United Kingdom shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.2.    Any person who knowingly prints, publishes, edits or oiroulates any book, pamphlet, leaflet, paper or dooument of any kind, in whioh is advocated the unlawful use of foroe, violence or physical injury to person or property as a means of overthrowing the constituted Govern-ment of the United Kingdom shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and the dooument shall be seized and destroyed.3.    Any person who Bhall receive from any alien money for the purposes set out in Clauses 1 and 2 shall be guilty of a misdemeanour,with provision for search and for the summary conviction of offenders.I am disposed to think&apos;that these proposals deservo the serious oon-sideration of the Government, It is true that the oommon law of sedition covers most if not all the offenoos described in the draft, but(a) The oommon law of sedition Is old and has fallen into disuse and in some respects into disrepute.    What is needed is a new mandate from Parliament.(b) The punishment for graver offences is insufficient - imprison-ment in the First Division under conditions whioh are s* lenient that they do not prevent the prisoner oarrying on propaganda from the prison,(o)    Minor offences cannot be tried summarily.If it is decided tw legislate on the lines proposed, I think that (as in the case of some other offences), it should bo in the discretion of the prosecution to ask the Justices, if the offence is a minor one, to deal with the oase summarily?   if the offence is more serious, to commit for trial.     In the formor oase the punishment should be not exocoding throe
months;   in the latter it should be penal servitude or imprisonment up to two years.I append extracts from the Canadian Statute, and from a bill which has passed the United States Senate.E.S.APPENDIX A.Extracts from Canadian Statute 9 and 10 Geo.
