[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mapesty&apos;sSjo^ernmeni.&apos; j0CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,(11510.) Foreign Office.Finland/005.MEMORANDUMonPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN FINLAND.LITTLE is known in this country about the present political situation in Finland. There was a time some months ago when Helsingfors was flooded with foreign corre-spondents who had come there in expectation of the capture of Petrograd by General Yudenich. Now that all prospect of a sudden change taking place in the situation across the Finnish border has disappeared, there is again an almost complete absence of news from Helsingfors.And yet Finland is at present passing through a critical phase of her existence as an independent State. She is near the storm-centre of social upheaval in Eastern Europe, and it is difficult for her statesmen to steer a prudent course between reaction and communism. The class bitterness engendered by the Civil War of 1918 has not yet died down, and, in spite of the strength of Finnish nationalism, there are many who still look for guidance to Petrograd and Moscow. In Petrograd there is a Finnish Communist organisation consisting of those Red Finns who sought shelter in Soviet Russia after the success of the Whites in Finland ; this organisation, liberally financed by the Soviet Government, is untiring in its efforts to smuggle propaganda across the frontier, and to prepare the way for a new Red rising with the support of the Russian Red Army. It has many sympathisers in Finland, in spite of the tact that Communism has been strongly denounced by the official Social Democratic Party in the Finnish Diet. But in Finland, as elsewhere, the Socialists are divided into several camps, and Socialism is in a state of flux, so that it is impossible to foretell which way the current will drive the majority. At the moment the Moderates in the party outnumber the Left Socialists, who differ very little from the Communists, but the pressure of the latter is strong, and they, mav succeed in pushing the Moderates further and further to the Left in the same way as the Soviets pushed Kerensky. to wards the end of his short-lived career.In the old Finnish Diet, before Finnish independence was realised, the main political parties were the two Finnish Nationalist Parties, the Old Finns (Conservative) and the Young Finns (Liberal), the Swedish National Party, the Agrarians (chiefly peasants) and the Social Democrats. Since the Civil War the party formations have undergone a change, and there are now five main political parties in the Diet, of which far the most numerous is the Social Democratic. In a Diet of 200 members the Socialists obtained 80 seats at the last election, and although they are not represented in the Government, they are very largely able to control the actions of the Government on all important questions. The majority of the party believe in the Parliamentary system and repudiate the doctrines of the Soviet Government. They wish to secure an absolute majority in the Diet so that by peaceful methods they may carry, out the full Socialist propramme, although the Left wing is inclining more and more towards the Third International and, after the pattern of the German Independent Socialists, are turning more towards Moscow than towards Western Europe.After the Socialists, the most numerous party in the present Diet is the Agrarian with 42 seats. The Agrarians are essentially a peasant party, strongly republican and democratic. Together with the Progressive Party they form the Centre Bloc, from which the present Government has been formed. The Progressive Party, with 22 seats in the Diet, is the direct successor of the Young Finns. The present party dates from the end of 1918, when the bulk of the Young Finns, who had remained true to republican traditions during the German occupation, united with a number of Old Finns who disapproved of German attempts to force a monarchy on the country. This party consists chiefly of the Finnish intelligentsia who, though keen Finnish Nationalists, are not chauvinist and deprecate dissension between Finns and Swedes. They have supplied the majority of the present Government, one of their most from-jient members being M. Holsti, the present Minister for Foreign Affaire. [2435]
To the Right of the Centre Bloc come the Kokoomus (Coalition) Party with 28 seats in the Diet and the Swedish Party with 22. The Kokoomus Party was founded at the same time as the Progressive Party, and is composed of the bulk of the Old Finns and the Right wing of the Young Finns, who abandoned their former political standpoint as the result of the Civil War. They favour a Constitutional Monarchy, but, failing that, they demand sufficient guarantees to free the administration from becoming the mere tool of a single Chamber. They are strong advocates of the Protective Guards, in whom they see the only bulwark against anarchy, and are sharply opposed to concessions to the Left so long as the danger of a recrudescence of Bolshevism remains.The Swedish Party with 22 seats in the Diet unites under its banner the majority of the Swedish population in Finland, though a group known as the Swedish Republican Left has now broken away and has thrown in its lot with the Centre Bloc. The hero of the Swedish Party is General Mannerheim, and the hostility of the present Government to MannerheinVs policy makes the Swedish Party the most bitter opponents of the Government^ policy, both in home and foreign affairs.Faced by the violent opposition of the Right, who have never reconciled themselves to the defeat of Mannerheim at the Presidential election last summer, and the vigilant criticism of the Socialists, the Centre Government has a very difficult task. Outnumbered by the Socialists in the Diet, the Government has either to throw in its lot with the Right, which it refuses to do, or yield to constant pressure from the Left. The history of the last few months has shown a slow but steady inclination to the Left on the part of the Government. On two questions, one of home and one of foreign policy, the Socialists have succeeded in forcing the hands of the Government, though in neither case have they yet obtained their full programme. These questions have been, firstly, the amnesty for those who took part on the side of the Reds in the Civil War, and, secondly, peace with the Soviet Government. The disbandment of the Protective Guards, which has been constantly demanded by the Socialists, has so far been refused by the Government.The Amnesty Bill finally became law on the 30th January, when President Stahlberg affixed his signature to it. The present Amnesty Act is of a complicated character. The Socialists had demanded a general amnesty, but the Bill introduced by the Government into the Diet confined the amnesty to certain categories, those who were excluded from its terms being the members of the former Red Government in Helsingfors, the Workers&apos; General Committee and the Commanders of the Red Troops. It only includes those who have been tried and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment, and does not apply to those who sought refuge in Russia or the Murman Legionaries, who are to be dealt with separately. It is estimated that as a result of the new Act about 3,000 prisoners will immediately he released, and about 40,000 of those who sided with the Reds in the Civil War will have full civil rights restored to them.Owing to the support of the Socialists, the Amnesty Bill passed through the Diet and was then referred to the Supreme Court for their opinion. It was rejected unanimously by the latter body, and the final responsibility was thus thrown upon the President.. According to the Constitution, the President has the right of veto, and there was much speculation as to whether he would dare to use it in this case. It was known that the Government itself was divided, and it.was not easy for the President to go against the decision of the highest judicial body in the country. The Right, fearing the accession of 40,000 electors to the Socialist Party, conducted a vigorous campaign against the Bill, and urged Stahlberg to show that the President was not to be regarded as the mere tool of the Diet, and was guided by judicial rather than by political considerations. The President himself was in a difficult position. It was dangerous to ignore the Diet, for by flouting, the Socialists he would have played into the hands of the Extremists in the country, and there is little doubt that the Centre Government itself would have collapsed. On the other hand, the ratification of the Amnesty Bill has already led to the resignation of Kahelin, Minister of Justice, who will probably be followed by Lundson, the Minister of Finance, and the Socialists, in spite of the Presidents action, have refused to join a new Coalition Government.The question of Finland&apos;s relations with Russia has not yet been settled. During the summer and autumn of 1919, when the Russian Whites were planning an attack on Petrograd, strong pressure was brought to bear on the Finnish Government to induce them to co-operate against the Bolsheviks. On both occasions military help was refused. When Yudenich&apos;s attack finally collapsed, and when it became clear that the Red Army had triumphed on every front, the Governments of the Border States decided to call
together a Conference in Helsingfors to discuss the question of a defensive alliance against Soviet Russia and the future of the Baltic. This Conference met in Helsingfors in January, and included Finnish, Polish, Esthonian, Lettish and Lithuanian represen-tatives. On the question of policy towards Russia it was difficult to reach a unanimous decision. Not only did differences arise between the Poles and the Lithuanians, the latter showing themselves less hostile to Soviet Russia than to Poland, but the Esthonians refused to defer the conclusion of a separate peace with the Soviet Government. The general feeling of the Conference was in favour of a defensive alliance against Russia, but a final decision was left to a future Conference to be summoned at Riga in March.The Finnish Government, although refusing to help the Russian Whites against the Reds, has equally refused to come to terms with the Soviet Government. Trotsky&apos;s famous motto at Brest-Litovsk, &quot; Neither peace nor war,&quot; has been adopted, but, now that Esthonia has set the example, it is doubtful how long Finland can refuse to follow suit. For the moment, however, Finland is determined to mark time until the policy of the Allied Governments towards Soviet Russia has been more clearly defined. The Finnish press did not look on the recent announcement made by the Supreme Council in Paris on its Russian policy as anything more than a temporary expedient, and the general impression from the very beginning was that the attempt to open up trade relations with Russia would soon be followed by formal peace negotiations. The Finnish Government, therefore, is fully determined to await further developments in London, and, as far as Soviet Russia is concerned, it will follow whatever lead is given by the Allied Governments.There is one other question of internal politics which has caused a good deal of discussion in Finland, and upon which the Government has not yet come to an agree-ment with the Socialists. Socialist and even Communist propaganda has been active amongst the soldiers of the regular army, and it is generally realised that in case of another Red rising the army as a whole could not be relied upon. It was for this reason that the Protective Guards or Skyddskorps were formed in February 1919, while Mannerheim was still in power. Their duties are those of a civic guard, their members being chiefly drawn from the bourgeoisie and from peasant proprietors. Attempts were undoubtedly made during the summer of 1919 to use them for political purposes, and the impression got about that Mannerheim intended to use them for his advance on Petrograd. This made them very much distrusted by the Socialists, who extorted a promise from President Stahlberg at his election that he would disband them. So far, however, nothing has been done, as the Government fears the hostility of the bourgeoisie, and does not itself care to face the responsibility of disbanding the only reliable bulwark against Communist excesses. The Socialists have raised the question on many occasions, but during the last few weeks attention has been so much concentrated on other questions, such as the Amnesty Act and foreign policy, that the Government has not had its hand forced.The bitterness caused by the excesses of the Civil War has not yet disappeared. The policy of the present Government has been to win over the working classes by conciliation and leniency, but progress in this direction has been slow, and is hampered by the close proximity of Soviet Russia, which is a constant stimulus to further class warfare. There are constant rumours of trouble, and excitement has been caused by the return of Mannerheim to Finland. The workmen fear a cowp on the part of the Whites, the latter fear disturbance from the Reds. The Civil War left many evils behind it, and, with Soviet Russia just beyond the frontiers, the transition from war to peace is slow and difficult.February 26, 1920.
