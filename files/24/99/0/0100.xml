Further details not yet received.(7) Following are extracts from appreciation by General Climo, dated 26th February :--&quot; During the week I visited the advance column and was thoroughly satisfied with everything I saw. The hospitals are well found and well managed. I visited each one, and am fully satisfied that casualties being evacuated suffer neither inconvenience nor hardship that is avoidable in any way. All. the services on the lines of communication are working smoothly and efficiently throughout, and I was particularly impressed by the good condition of transport and the contented demeanour of the transport personnel, in spite of the undoubted hardship of the daily work, which includes much fording of icy streams in all weathers. The arrangements - for protection showed ability in the location of picket posts, and much care and attention has been expended in making these posts thoroughly strong and secure. No system can ensure against cases of individual sniping, but immunity from serious attack on convoys is directly attributable to the skill and energy with which the pickets have been situated and constructed. The troops themselves are confident and contented, and have a feeling of elation that is fully justified by ,the difficulties they have overcome which cannot be realised fully without a personal knowledge of the terrain. I was particularly impressed by the Ahnai Tangi and the country near there. The ground is exceptionally bad with precipitous rocky hills on both sides, and it speaks highly for the valour of the troops and the resolution of the commander that they managed to carry through successfully the operations culminating on 14th January.&quot;Paras. (3) and (7) not communicated to Press.A
