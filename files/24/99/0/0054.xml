THIS DOCtMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHNICSECRETELECTRICITY SUPPLY BILL 1920.MEMORANDUM FOR THE CAM BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY Tt) THE MINISTRY &apos;0F TRANSPORT, \1,    I have been requested by the Minister of Transport during his temporary absence to submit this memorandum for the considera-tion of the Cabinet%2o    In the Electricity Supply Bill as it left the Houseof Commons last year Clause 34 read as follows:-(1)    The Electricity Commissioners may lend, on such terms and conditions as, subject to the approval of the Treasury, they think fit, to a district electricity board or any authorised undertakers any money, not exceeding in the aggregate twenty-five million pounds, which the board , or undertakers are authorised to borrow if the Commissioners are satisfied that the Board or undertakers cannot otherwise raise the money on reasonable terms,(2)    Any sums required for the purposes of such advances as aforesaid shall be issued out of a special fund to be under the charge of the Electricity Commissioners, and to be called the electricity loans fund, and to that fund shall be carried all sums received by the Commissioners on account of interest or of repayment of the loans made by them,(3) For the purpose of raising money for the electricity loans fund the Electricity Commissioners may issue stock, to be called electricity stock, bearing interest at such rate as the Commissioners with the consent of the Treasury may deter-mine, and such stock shall be issued, transferred, dealt with, and redeemed according to regulations made by the Commission-era with the consent of the Treasury,N  (4)    Interest on electricity stock shall be charged on the electricity loans fund, and the Treasury may guarantee: in such manner and on such terms as they think fit, the payment of&apos;such interest, and any sums required by the Treasury for fulfilling their guarantee under this section shall be charged on and paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom, or the growing produce thereof, and any sums paYable by the Commissioners to tho Treasury as consideration for such guarantee as aforesaid shall be paid into the Exchequer,This was in the part of the Bill which was withdrawn in the Lords on a definite statement by the Lord Chancellor that the Government would bring in the rest of the Bill when the House re-assembled.3,     On consideration of tho Lords Amendments in the Commons
both the Home Secretary and the Minister of Transport were emphatic in their statements to the effect that it was intended to reproduce the excised portions on the House re-assembling. Having regard to these statements a Bill has been drafted asking for precisely the same powers as..those Yvhich were omitted,. This policy has been adopted-deliberately   so.that the Government may be able to say they are,inviting the House of Commons to reaffirm its previous decision without any alterations whatever.4.    The Chancellor .of the-Exchequer desires that the... financial powers contained in Section 34 shall not be re-produced, and the matter is submitted to the.&apos;. Cabinet for its. consideration,5,    It will be observed that Clause 34 enables.the Electricity Commissioners to make advances to .district electricity boards or any authorised undertakers not ..exceoding .in the aggregate twenty-five million pounds .upon terms aiid; oc.n&apos;ditions to be approved by the Treasury,     It was proposed that. ,the.\. Electricity Commissioners should raise the funds for the purpose&apos;&apos; by the issue of electricity Stock,, the -interest., upon, which was- to&apos;&apos; be guaranteed by the Treasury:&apos;.;.. The /game,&apos;reasons&quot;&apos; J&amp;which&apos; operated,-. t: last year in support of&apos;the necessity for. these financial&apos; &quot;provisip still remain, and the local authorities to be set up&apos; to&apos;&quot;carry out the Act may find themselves; in difficulty as to&apos;,raising&quot; the necessary capital on anything like reasonable, terms without this..Treasury guarantee,i        ....6,    It will be noted it is only, proposed to use the ;power if the Commissioners are satisfied that the authorities cannot otherwise raise the money on reasonable terms,7,    In the Jhito Paper, Command,188, circulated in the Commons, the matter was dealt with as follows:-3*    Cuarshtee.of, interest by Treasury, &quot;In Clause 33 the Treasury are empowered to guarantee
the interest, on such terms as they think fit, on stock not exceeding  25,000,000, to be issued by the Electricity Commissioners for the purpose of loans to District Electricity Boards or authorised undertakers vtiere it. appears that money necessary for the purpose of the undertakings cannot be otherwise raised on reasonable terms aIt is impossible to say in what cases (if any) it will be necessary to call upon this guarantee.     The whole scheme is based upon the anticipation that the industry shall be self-supporting, and it is not expeoted that the guarantee will, in fact, involve the Treasury in any payment, but the provision is regarded as necessary, If only for the purpose of facilitating the issue of such stock as may be found to be required,&quot;8.    As I understand the early introduction of the Bill is desired, I submit the question for the early consideration of the Cabinets26.2*1920,(Sd) ARTHUR NEAL.
