JThis Onrnmnnt is the Property ofHis Brrcx .     &apos;;-ujesty&apos;s Government.)WAR PENSIONS BILL, 1920.c&apos;0;:nviitt6&amp; of Home Affairs.   Clause 1 Is Intended to give effect to the Cabinet&apos;s of tEe^ETof November, by, Mitch It was decided to back to the Service Departments the responsibility for and.Administration of Disability Pensions other than for the present war,decisionof the 16th July, 1919, the 50th2.   By Cabinetil, 1920, (the date when the Military Service Acts cease to operative) was fixed as the date for the termination of the sent far Warrants, and this date has been adopted in Clause I,By Clause 1 the power (given by the War Pensions Act, 1915,) of supplementing the Separation Allowances of the families of men still in Naval and Military service will automatically be brought to an end.   The question of the continuance of Separation Allowances by the Service Departments in the case of men who, after the Armistice, engaged to continue their service, has not yet been finally settled,&quot;but by the 30th April, all men compul-compulsorily retained under the Military Service Acts who have not so re-engaged, will, it Is understood, have been demobilised,&apos; and, in view&quot;of the increased rates of Service Pay, It is desirable that rates of supplementation (If supplementation is to be continued at all) should be reconsidered.   In this matter the Service Departments are primarily concerned, and will be consulted, and proposals for any continuance of supplementation that may be considered advisable will be submitted to the Cabinet,Meantime,, it is not desirable in this Bill provision for continuing supplementation as one of of the Ministry of Pensions. -to make express the functions4.   Clause 2 as drafted will operate to re-transfer to the Service Departments the administration of disability pensions and retired pay for previous wars, as well as for future wars.   Some objection has been taken to this by the Admiralty and War Office on the ground that the bulk of cases of disability pensions for former wars have been levelled up to the pension scales of the present war, and that their re-transfer back to. the Service Departments now might occasion confusion.   The Warrants relating to pre-war. pensions do not,, however, give the full benefits of the present War Warrants to pre-war pensioners, but merely Increase the monetary scale of pensions,, and, consequently, no, greater difficulty should be found in the Service Departments administering these Warrants than in the Ministry of, Pensions administering, e,g. the 1914 Pay $errant of the War Office. -Moreover, on general grounds of policy, lo is very desirable that the Ministry of Pensions should, as the Cabinet decided, be.responsible for the pensions available for&apos; the Civilian Forces of the present war only, and. that disability awards to the Professional Forces, whether of the past ov- tne future, should be in the hands of the Service Departments,   It may otherwise be very difficult to resist the demand that all the benefits of the War Warrants 1 (including wife&apos;s allowances) should be granted to pre-war pen-sioners.5*   Clause^ Sii^i provides for tho administration of wound pensions in the oaie&quot;oT&quot;&quot;offleers retired in consequence of a disability sustained In the present war, if they arc&apos; also entitled to disability retired pay.   The wound pensions were, under the Ministry of Pensions Act, 1916, reserved to the Service Departments,but
but the dual responsibility involved in the administration of disability retired pay by the Ministry of Pensions, and of the wound pension by the Service Departments, has caused consider-able confusion and led to delay in the award of retired pay, with consequent hardship in many cases.   Lord Keig, among others, has publicly drawn attention to this anomaly.   The principle of the sub-section now proposed was agreed by Lord Porster and Dr. Ifacltemerci.6.   Clause&apos;5 is intended to enable the Minister to secure a more &quot;efficient and economical administration locally by dissolving the Local War Pensions Committee for ft County and. forming out of the various sub-committees new Local Committees for combined areas within the County,   Such a re-arrangement of areas has already been agreed, to in two or more cases, &quot;including . that of London,7.   Clause 4 effects minor amendments of the War pensions Acts, .    -   -8,   Clause 5 enables the Minister to put in a Finance Officer of his&apos; own to control the monies entrusted by the Ministry to a particular Local Committee, and to make all payments ont of them.   Where this was done the Committee would become an advisory body like e.g, the Old Age Pensions Committee. At present Local Committees are spending ?lf millions a year, and, in some instances, it is found that they have been spending money without warrant under the Regulations, even after being warned that their expenditure is irregular..   I am satisfied that action of this kind will, in some cases,.be necessary in the 1.nterests of publiceconomy,9.   Clause 6 merely gives the Inspectors of the Ministry the powers pbTsesbecT at present by Inspectors of the Ministry of Health and other Government Departments.10,   Clause 7 enables the Minister to restore pensions that have beerTTorfeTted under the Forfeiture Act 1876, on -&apos; the&apos; discharge.of a pensioner from a term of imprisonment, and, in addition.&quot;, to pay some part of the man s pension to his. family during his imprisonment where circumstances justify this.   The Minister has this power at present so far as regards soldiers and sailors but not as regards officers or airmen&quot;.&apos; This clause has been accepted by the Treasury.11.Clause 8. gives the .sarne Statutory right to pension (and subject to -the same conditions) to a widow or motherless child as&quot;is already given to disabled officers and men by Section 7 of the-?ar&quot;Pensions Act, 1919,12.   Clause 9 extends to a very slight extent the powers, of the Minister&quot;fdFlfealing with Ex-Service men &apos;s children under Section 9 of the War Pensions - Act, 1918,15.   Clause 10. only remedies the existing anomaly whereby, while1: pensions to disabled men and. widows of soldiers are exempt from Stamp Duty, pensions and other allowances to widows - of Seamen ere&apos; not so exempt.Ministry of Pensions.February, 1920..
