f^Cgg IS THE PROPgHTX g  HIS ilS^ ^ GOVERN? ).,.j Q j0 R E T*      5 CABINET.728. &apos;     HIGH PRICES..    goto by the British Ohano^^r of the Exchequer.(Circulated for information in connection with *decision of the Supreme Council on February 23rd,1920)-...... .**I am in general agreement with the views expressed-..by the President of the Board of.Trade in his* ,     4 merelymemorandum.     I desire/to draw special attention t* one point with which he has dealt.In the United Kingdom the continuous expansion up till a recent date in the outstanding volume of paper currency was an effect of the continuous expansion of credit caused mainly by advances made to the Government by the Bank of England on the credit of Ways and Means.     In France, as I understand, the advances made by the Bank of France to the Government were made chiefly in the form of issues of, notes. The method of inflation was therefore different but the. results were much the same, viz. a continuous increase in the spending power of the community accompanied by a decrease or at least an absence of increase in the volume of purchase-able goods&apos; and services.     It is this change in the . proportion between spending power and purchaseable things which has caused high prices, excessive imports and depre-eiation of the Currency.     These evils cannot be corrected by any violent or heroio measure without very serious consequences, but they can be gradually and steadily dealt with by a policy of increased production ana deflation of credit.    Deflation of credit depends almost entirely on the action of the Government in each country.    If it refuses steadily t* embark on expenditure whioh it cannot meet out of the proceeds of taxation or of long-term borrowings, i.e. which oannot be paid for out of the current savings of its nationals, the only alternative is fresh creationo^
jof credit and increased inflation.     Every Government must therefore, -aim fljja1x,a^-mooting all its-expenditure out of the current savings of its nationals (including where necessary r--th3---prooaods of past savings converted into cash by sale abroad) and seaondly at reducijig^ho^uts^aj^^ short term debt, particularly if they have taken&quot;the form of direct advances from a. Bank of Issue.     It follows that (1) any kind of action which Involves heW&apos; creation of credit and new inflation ought to be sternly ruled out (2) any loans by one country to another ought to. take the.form of issues in the open market and ought to be limited In amount to such total as can be obtained from the public of the country in which the issue is made without recourse to.special measures involving new creations of credit. e.g. special terms &quot;for borrowing from the State Bank on the security of the bonds so iBSued. and (3.) any action by a GovernmQnt which enables it to get control of the purchasing power of the people and use the proceeds to reduce floating debt, whether the imposition of extra taxation, the floating of internal loans or the reduction of its pro-gramme of expenditure, will serve to help to restore the general economic conditions of Europe.The United Kingdom is specially concerned because its own position now Is that with a surplus of Government revenue over expenditure &quot;and a favourable balance of trade, its effects to restore sterling exchange to par with gold are largely frustrated by,the demands for accommodation for European customers which fall upon the -London Money Market.*****&apos;,.-.) *********  -asury, 3.W.I. February 26th, 1920.
