Ytb\s Do cum e nt i s t h e Pro pe rty of his Bntannio Mfcajesty-s Government.)190THE USB OP ANIMALS IN CHEMICAL WARFARE RESEARCH.(circulated &quot;by the Home Secretary).accordance with the wish of the Cabinet I have consulted the Law Officers on the question whether the experiments on animals proposed by the War Offioe in oonneotion with their chemical warfare research would be permissible under the terms of the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.    The Law Officers advise that the Act does not prohibit the experiments in question and that there is nothing in the Act to prevent the Home Secretary from issuing his licence for such experiments^ but that the certificates prescribed by the Act must be obtained if it desired in the oase cf any of the experiments to dispense with the use of anaesthetics or to keep the animal alive after the effect of the anaesthetic has passed off.The question therefore whether these experiments can be allowed is entirely one of policy.    The memorandum of the Master General of Ordnance which was circulated to the Cabinet by the Seoretary of State for War on 5th January seems to imply thaWthe Home Office has objected to experiments of this kind, That is not the cafe&apos;.    The Home Offioe put no difficulties at all in the way of these experiments during the War, but it was thought right in May, 1919, when a fresh application was made to the Home Office for a lioence to carry out such experiments, to ask the War Office to oonsider &quot;whether this class of experiment which was required for the purpose of the war ought not to be discontinued now that operations have ceased&quot;.    The Array Caunoil replied to the Home Offioe letter that the experiments had been discontinued for the present;   and the question of their continuance has not been discussed sinoe between the two Departments.    The Home Office has not been consulted by the War Office Committee referrod to. in the memorandum nor does the report of the Committee appear to have been oommunicated to the Department.Experiments with poisonous gases may. as the Cabinet will appreciate, involve very severe suffering to the animals used.the research is of great importance and the experiments proposed are likely to lead to valuable additions to our knowledge;   and in its decisions   it is guided largely by the advioe of a speoial Advisory Committee presided over by Lord Moulton,Further, such experiments are only allowed under the following conditionsf-(1) the actual operative procedure, if any, would have to he performed under an anaesthetic;   (2$ if the animal after coming out of the anaesthetic iB found to be suffering severe pain which is likely to endure, it must be killed at onoe; (3) the number of the experiments is strictly limited;   U) the experiments are closely supervised by the Inspectors appointed under the Act, who may direct any animal to be killed.In its ordinary administration of the Aot, the Home Office only allows applications for experiments likely to involve severe pain, where the object of
In the appears of gassing experiments, these conditions cannot be observed except very partially.    It is essential that they should be carried out without anaesthetics and that the animal should be allowed to survive at any rate for a time;   the number of experiments must neoessarily be large - over 10,000 were done at the Government Station at Porton in 1918;   and supervision by the Inspectors is hardly possible.    The condition   that an animal suffering severe pain which is likely to endure should be killed at once may also have to be suspended, though in the case of the experiments carried on during the war its suspension was only asked in certain instances.Whether the considerations of the national safety are sufficiently strong to make it necessary to waive the ordinary restrictions on experiments on animals and allow the proposed experiments to be carried out, is a question of policy which must bo decided by the Cabinet.If allowed, the nature of the experiments will not be published in the Home Offioe reports to Parliament under the Act, and it may be thought desirable to make it a condition that nothing should be published by the experimenters themselves in the scientific journals or elsewhere.    the fact that suoh experiments  were being made, however, cane out during the War, and it is hardly possible to conceal the fact.    If it does, the Government will certainly have to face attack in Parliament on the subject,With reference to the statement in the memorandum that dogs will not be used for the experiments, I should add that Sir George Thane, the Chief Inspector under tho Act, is by no means confident that it may not bo found necessary, to do so, owing to their much greater resemblance to man.    It would bo dangerous to assume, because a goat (for inBtanco) might be insusceptible to a particular gas * that man would also be.E. S.1st March, 1920.
