CONGESTION OF SHIPS WITH DEAD I3AT.3rd March, 1920.1. 2.3. 4, 5.6.From enquiries made the Shipping Controller is satisfied that there is no prospect of the present congestion being materially relieved unless decided action is taken by the Cabinet.Stocks in cold store in the United Kingdom on 21st February were nearly 132,000 tons, of which 93,000 tons were mutton and lamb (mainly Australian).     On February 24th, nine steamers with 24,,000 tons of meat were discharging more or less regularly and twelve with 23,000 tons meat were waiting for berths.       Between PebBuasy 24th and February 20th six jnore steamers arrived with 18,500 tons meat.Anticipated arrivals of further supplies are:-March :57,,000 tons;   April 53,000 tons;   May 67,000 tons; June 65,000 tons;   Total 242,000 tons.Anticipated consumption is:- March 54,000 tons; April 59,000 tons;   Hay 64,000 tons;   June 64,000 tons; Total 241,000 tons.. There is thus a practical equality between supplies and consumption during the next four months, but there is nothing to relieve the present congestion either of meat in store or of ships awaiting discharge.    Further, by the .end of July or in early August, British grass fed cattle will begin to come into supply, and relief must be found before that time.The three possible ways of r elieving the congestion are to stimulate the consumption of Australian mutton by reducing the price, to reduce the stream of beef coming from the Plate, and to reduce the supply of home killed meat.      The Board of Trade and the Ministry of Food are reducing the price of mutton, and steps are being taken which it is hoped will either break the flow for a short time of the meat ships from the Plate or, at any rate, reduce the stream, but both these measures will be in-effectual unless in addition something can be done at the same time to reduce the supply of home killed meat. Australian ships are being delayed some of them 2/3 months and this is most seriously affecting passenger trade to the Colonies etc the Shipping Controller therefore suggests that the Board of Agriculture and Ministry of Food should consider whether the supply&apos; of home killed meat cannot be sus-pended or greatly reduced for say a fortnight to a month to relieve the intolerable position,(Signed) J.P.MA0kAY.
