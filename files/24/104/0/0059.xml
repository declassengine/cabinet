tornu, Government.    &apos;    ^ - COi0 X B I N E T. ^BT.^ .......GOAL PiilO^S. ---------------------M$ta by the Pregident of the Board, of Trade.I oiroulate for the early consideration of the Cabinet a Memorandum on Goal Prices.In short tho proposals are -(l) The price of inland coal, which is at present being sold at a loss% should be raised to an eoonomio level, as follows:-(a)   The price of industrial coal to bo increased by 4/2 per ton*(la)   The prico of household coal to be increased by 14/2 per ton6     (This includes reimposing the 10/-. which was taken off the price of household coal in November last.     It will be remembered the/fc. this reduction was a temporary expedient to lighten the oost of living during a difficult period)*The proposed new psnce should be a maximum priceonly, and there should be no minimum^     It is thoughtthat this arrangement would induct coalowners to selltheir poorer grades of ooal at lower prices.(2) That this should be accompanied by a rolaxation ofGovernment control ovor the distribution of ooal for home consumption, and control should hereafter be confined -(a) to the r egulation of exports in such a way as to to ensure that sufficient supplies will be held in the country for home needs;(b) to the regulation of homo erica.: in such a way as to prevent prices rising unuuly.It is believed that this partial removal of control would effect an increased production and an improvementin quality by bringing the mine owners into personaltouch again with their customers, and thus compellingthem to take an increased interest in the   amount and character of tho outputaRc*S.H0BHB,    , , . 26a4020B
In March 1919      The Sankoy Commission recommend ed;-(a), an increase, of wages to tho miners (z/** per shift) to take effect from 9th January 1919, and(b) a reduction in working&apos; hours to 7 hows per dey, to take effect from mid-July,Both recommendations were accepted by the Government.In July 1919.      Tho Government reviewed the. finances of the coal industry in the light sf the increased costs invoiced in the acceptance of these recommendations, and in the light also of the low rate of output then prevailing. It was decided to increase the price of inland coal by 6/- per ton.This increase was not enough to raise inland coal to an economic prioe.The desire not to hamper the revival of industry which had then begun was indeed a determining factor against raising the prioe      the full economic level. It was also hoped that the output per man would increase as the men returning from the colours settled into the mines again.      If output per man was thus increased, cost of production would neoessarily fall.In November 1919   the Government again reviewed the financialposition of the coal industry, in view of pressure from the Labour party for a reduction in price.Two considerations governed the situation;-(a) Export profits had risen enormously, instead of declining as the Sankey Commission predicted they would.(b) The industries of the country - even in spite of the 6/- increase in coal in July - were reviving quickly and using more coal.It was decided therefore not to reduce the price of all inland coal, but to make a reduction only on household coal &apos;Tas a direct aid to the cost of living in the exceptional and abnormal times&quot; (i.e. for the winter).    A reduction of 10/* per ton was accordingly made on household coal.     It was, in fact, and was so stated to be at the time, a special subsidy given to the householder   out of the surplus export profits which the Government expected to have in hand at the end of the financial year, SLst. March, 1920.1.   Recent History.
II,   Present position(a) generally,To-day the position is much clearer than it was either in July or November,(1)   Industrial conditions generally are more settled.(2)   Politically the atmosphere is clearer:-Rationalisation of the mines remains as part of the policy of the Labour party, but the danger of direct aotion in support of it has passed,(3)   The public as a whole is recognising the deslra-billty of getting rid of subsidies of all kinds.(b) As regards Output of CoalLuring the winter months there has been a considerable improvement in the output of coal as compared with the July-November period (see Appendix 1.)    Unf ortunately the improvement is not progressive.    The output Is stationary at under 5 million tons a week.,    -?r. adlition the quality of coal is not improving,    &apos;7e .are getting quantity at the expense of&apos; quality.     Thus the- present rate of output (say 240 millions per annum) may not be equivalent to more than say 210 to 215 million tons pre-v:/ar in effective use.It is generally agreed that one of the most definite measures that can be taken to improve the quality of coal will be to remove all artificial restrictions on inland distribution so that the old ohannels of supply may be restored and Collieries will be in such direct touch with their-customers that complaints as to quality will be dealt with at the colliery.    This step will also help production by giving the Colliery Owner a more intimate interest in output.    It involves, however,, the removal of any differ-entiation between the price bf household coal and the coal supplied for industrial:pur poses.     I am of opinion that this in itself is a proper course of action and that this is the right time to take. it.The period of the year is suitable*,     Household cams imp t ion, is;, slackening off, and stocking&apos; as against next winters consumption both in works and households will not befcln f or a month or two.    Such disturbance in supplies as will.result during the transfer from control of distri-bution to freedom of distribution may therefore be faced. Control will&apos; therefore be confined to:-(i) The regulation.of exports in such a way as to ensure that sufficient supplies will..be,;held in the oountry for home needs, and . . .-.     : ;(ii) The regulation of home price in such a way as to prevent prices rising unduly.Ill, Proposed increase in the Prioe of  &apos;&quot;- Coal,-.- ....From Appendix II It will be&apos; observed that at the present tima - after giring effect to the recent increase in mineral,wages f inland coal is: being;,sQia at an average prioe which is 4/2 less than the- price.- required to coyer, average cost &apos;of. production and..average profit per ton. allowed to Goal Ownisrrs under the, Coal Mines, (Bmergenoy) Aot-Household. Coal-under the. arrangement by which it is charged at ten shillings, less; than industrial coal is being sold at 14/2 less than -its. economic price..
It is true there is a large profit on export ooal and foreign bunkers and a decision will have to oe t:.ken as to how it is to be dealt vith.-     This is reforred to later.(a) Inland OpalI an of opinion that the prioe of inland coal should be raised to an economic level (i.e. household coal by 14-/2 and industrial by 4/2 per ton) for the.following aaasons:-(l)    Until the output of ooal increases substantially, almost 7/8ths of the total will be required for home pur-ooses and the administrative burden of financing Collier^ supplying ?/8ths of the total output at an average Xpss is very great even if the principle were right.(2)    Collieries working under financial strain - even, although loss is ultimately maje good to them from the pool of profits - cease to be progressive *   . Minor developments&apos; so necessary to keep output clastic * are not undertaken and there is a constant drag on the pits1 operations.    There is good reason to conolude that output-has already suffered on this account and that it is not possible to get beyond the present rate of output until there is more incentive to the owners individually*.(3)     The incentive to development and to opening new   -&apos; mines would&apos; be - greatly increased if suoh a step as raising inland prices to an eoonomio level were taken.    Nothing is so important to the future of the ooal Industry as to induce the present coal owners to put additional cap ital into the industry..(4)     It is impossible to justify the supply to other &apos; industries of ooal at less than an eoonomio price, especially since most industries are themselves making very .largo profits.    What industries need most is a larger supply of coal of better quality.(b) Sxport OoaJLIt has been necessary to restrict the export of coal very materially during the last two and a half months in order to meet home needs, and until output.improves it will he neoessary to restrict export still further. So long as export is so profitable and home coal is sold at a loss, the ,rork of protecting home supplies, is made very difficult.:.&apos; B1 or the 3 months ending 31st March, 1920.,,. (see; Appendix III) the surplus profit&apos;on exports - excluding foreign bunkers - was at an average rate of nearly Ji5.millions per -moutru -&quot;.
Aa to bunkers for foreign ,-oing Teasels, the Ministry of Shipping is still pressing that the price * on v:hioh a recent reduotion was made *- should he reduced to tho level of inland prices *     &apos;3ut apart from bunkers, and assuming that exports of coal will he still further restricted in quantity, there would on present prices be a substantial pnoiit , to the Statet on export coal of 3 to -i millions.However this surplus is dealt with -&quot;Whether (a) the St ete claims it in full for the ExohoruerOr (b) uses it in tho purchase of mineralroyaltiesit. should not^ affect the proposal to place inland coal on a proper eoonomio footing.    There is a direction in which tho surplus can in part be used to assist the play of economic forces on home prioeso    Under Government control advances in price have been applied uniformly to all grades of ooal and the new price had boen made a minimum as well as a maximum.    Thus the pro-war relation of grade to gr.:,do has boon disturbed.    When the present advance is put on, tho new price should become a;;maximiim price only, and there should be no minimum aOoal Ownors would it is believed be induced to sell their poorer grades of ooal at lower prices, and those manufacturers who can uso and   always did use these poorer grades in pre-war times will bo induced to take &apos; them againe    This will help enormously in tho distri-but ion of coal,-,    It will leave tho bettor grades for those who must have them and who at pro sent cannot got them, It will also solve many of tho complaints as to bad&quot; quality which arise-, from people got ting the wrong grade of   ooal for their purpose.R.3.H0EHB^
