Ministry of Transport).    Additional voluntary concessions in , this direction have been made by many of the undertakings. Further details are given in Appendix &quot;B&quot;.Tho arrangement in operation on the Railways at tho present time in respect of Workmen^ trains and Workmen^ fares are sot out in Appendix 11.0&quot;,Particulars of tho number of Workmen&apos;s journeys and tho receipts therefrom for the year 1913, the last period for

This increase has been partly brought about through passengers who have previously travelled by ordinary trains, trans-ferring to workmenrs trains to avoid paying the increased ordinary fares.The general conditions which obtained when Workmen&apos;s fares were first introduced, some forty or fifty years ago, have undergone radical alteration; both as regards the workmenfs wages and their working hours.     Then, an unskilled workman was *earning about  1 a week, while even the artisan was only in receipt of about  2 a week.     The salaries of the clerk class were, generally speaking higher than these, but today it is safe to say that the average earn-ings of the manual labourers are fully as high as those of clerks, shop assistants, and the like, whose work does not begin before 9 a^nu1 while the wages of skilled artisans are a good deal higheroLarge numbers of the working class, instead of starting work at or before 6 a.me as formerly, -now start work at 8 a,o.m. or
ev:,n la\or0    The general shortening of the hours of labour has also had the effect of extending the practice of working double, or in some cases, even treble shifts, at collieries and other places employing large numbers of mono    It is no longer possible, therefore, to draw a hard and fast line between the various classes of the community who require to travel to their work before say&quot;8.0 in..the morning and-those-who- travel later, and to label the- one- class as-workmen and the other as ordinary passengerst    On the other hand, it would be difficult to justify the continuance of an arrangement which enables a workman On a morning shift to travel to and from his work at a cost of say, 2d while his fellow workman on an afternoon shift requires to pay 1/loJd. for the same jourhey, a very extreme case but still a facU     (Pares between Liverpool Street and Enfield u G,E. Railway),,In the Cheap Trains Act 1883 there is no definition of the terin &quot;Workmen&quot;, probably owing to the difficulty at that time of even attempting such definition?    To-day, the term is still less capab&apos;A&amp; of definition, and even if it were possible to submit a definition it appears most undesirable to do so*So far as I know no scheme can be produced which can, under existing conditions, adequately and equitably carry out the intentions or secure the objects which the promoters of workmen1 s fares had in view when these fares were first instituted^The incidence of the present arrangements for workmen1 s fares is unscientific in its application and has the effect of benefiting one section of the community at the expense of the remainder of the travelling public, many of whom are financially worse off than the people who benefitaFs?om the evidence which has been placed before me, there is little doubt that workmen1s trains and workmen1s fares are generally unremunerakfrve under existing conditions.   Baking the extreme case of Liverpool Street - Enfield, a full train packed[4
seats and strap hanging doesn!t pay the wages of staff \- : Goal, Oil etc., used on the trip0    It, therefore, becomes a matter for serious consideration whether on financial grounds the general scale of workmen1s fares now in force can be continuede&apos;    So far as the Railway and Tramway Companies are concerned, workmen1 s trains, tramsv and 5buses should be run on an economic basis, in the same manner as ordinary passenger and goods trains.    The Ccmparies should not be encouraged to recoup themselves for any loss pa workmen1s tickets by &quot; -transferring the cost of the workmen1s cheap facilities to the ordinary passenger fares or the goods rates.The fact that they vary so greatly on different systems has had the effect, it seems to me, of driving workmen into special areas, e*g*, West Ham, Edmonton, ete0, with the result that we get large districts populated entirely by the working class, and without any sprinkling of richer people to assist in paying the rates.    The system has in this way also contributed to great congestion on certain lines, whereas a more even distribution of working class homes would have spread the load over :the whole of London^From a traffic point of view, there may, however, be considerable advantages in maintaining cheap fares in the mornings and evenings with the object of spreading the suburban traffic over a longer period and thus relieving, to some extent, the congestion which would otherwise result at the &quot;peak&quot; period , and this must be borne in mind in any review of workmen^ fares.The question of cheap fares in relation to the various housing schemes now being subsidised by the Government and also to labour generally are matters of special interest to the Ministries of Health and Laboura    The latter Department has suggested/
-5,** , .   . . -suggested that the most favourahle conditions already, prevailing oh any Railway in regard to cheap tickets for workers should he regarded as a standard to which the conditions on other Railways may so far as is practicable be raised^    I was unable to agree, but before any alteration in present privileges is adopted, the Departments concerned will be able to represent their views.It will be recollected that in a memorandum on the revision of Railway Rates which I submitted to the War Cabinet on the 13th October 1919, I stated that the question of revising Workmen?s fare3 may have to be raised:   that they were still on a pre-war basis., and were probably involving; considerable loss.I recommend, therefore, that the whole matter be referred to the Rates Advisory Committee, set up under Section 21 of the Ministry of Transport Act, and the approval of the Cabinet Is accordingly sought for the draft terms of ref-erence contained in Appendix VD*0....(Signed) ERIC GEDDES.22nd April,  ;.192Q*
APPENDIX V\ACTS   OF   PARLIAMENT   GOVERNING WORKMENfS CHEAP   TRAVELLING   FACILITIES.The first provision regarding the conveyance of Workmen at cheap fares appears to have been embodied in the Acts of the Metropolitan and North London Railway Companies in 1861.    Between that year and 1883 workmen^s clauses were inserted in the Acts of the following Companies:- the East London, the Great Eastern, the London, Chatham &amp; Dover, and the Metropolitan District.In 1882 a Select Committee of the House of Commons, on artizan3 and Labourers Dwellings Improvements, called attention in their report to &quot;the importance of favouring in every way facilities of transit between the great centres of industry and the outlying districts, and especially between the Metropolis and its; suburbs , and the Committee recommended &quot;That similar conditions as to Workmen&apos;3 trains within a certain distance from London, to &apos; those now imposed upon the Great Eastern Railway Company, should be enforced in the case of other railways as opportunities offer&quot;.The Great Eastern Company1^ Act referred to above was passed In 1864 when that Company, in order to relieve themselves of an expensive housing scheme in connection with the enlargement of Liverpool Street Station, came under obligation to run a train every morning in the week not later than 7 aaiw from Edmonton to Livotf-pool Street (8 miles 63 chains), and from Walthamstow to Liverpool Street (7 miles 9 chains) calling at intermediate stations, returning in the evening not earlier than 6 p.m. at fares not exceeding one penny per passenger for each journey.The Great Eastern Company have voluntarily extended the I fare imposed on them under the Act to Enfield Town which is the I termination of the Edmonton Branch, the distance being 10 miles I  59 chains, and the number of trains run from Enfield, Edmonton and I  Walthamstow at this special fare to 12.In 1883 the Cheap Trains Act was passedc    This Act granted exemption to the Railway Companies from the payment of passenger I Duty on fares not exceeding one penny a mile, and also imposed j&apos;  conditions upon the Companies in regard to the conveyance of Work-[ men and the section in the Act referring thereto reads as follows;-3. (1)    If at any time the Board of Trade have reason tobelieve(a) that upon any railway or part of a railway, or upon any line or system of railways, whether belonging to one company or to two or more com-panies, which forms a continuous means of communica-iion, a due and sufficient proportion of the accommodation provided by such company or companies is not provided for passengers at fares not exceeding the rate of one penny a mile or (t) that upon any railway carrying passengers proper and i sufficient workmen51 s trains are not provided forworlonen going to and returning from their work at such fares and at such times between six orclock in the evening and eight o1clock in morning as appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable.then/
then and in&apos; either ease tho Board of Trade may &quot;make such enquiry as they think necessary, or may, if required by the Company or any of the Companies concerned, refer &quot;the matter for tho decision of the Railway Commissioners, who shall have tho same power therein as if it had been referred to their decision in pursuance of tho Regulation of Railways Act 1873.(2)     If on an enquiry under this Act it is proved to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade or the Railway -Commissioners, as tho case may be, that such proper and sufficient&quot;accommodation or workmen1a trains as aforesaid are not provided by any railway company, the Board of. Trade or the Railway Commissioners, as tho case may be, may order tho company to provide such accommodation dr   , workmen&apos;s trains at such fares as, having regard to the circumstancesr&apos;may appear to the said Board or the Commissioners to be: reasonable.(3) r If any Company on whom an order, is made under this Act to&apos;provide proper and&apos;sufficient accommodation or workmen1 s trains refuse, or&apos;, at any time after the ei-piratlon of one month&quot;from the making thereof, neglect to comply with the&quot;order,: the Board of Trade shall issue a certificate to that&quot;effect to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and after the date of such certificate the company shall lose the benefit of this Act&quot;and be liable to pay In respect of the fare3 received after such date&quot;, the same amount of passenger duty as would be payable if the passenger duty had. not been varied as provided by this Act, and shall continue so liable in respect of all, fares received up to the date at which the Board of Trade,, certify that the company has complied with the said- Order. VJhere two &quot;or more companies are concerned, the certificate shall state whether both or all, or one or more, and which of them Is in defaulte(4)    A Company on whom an order is made by the &quot;Board of Trade under this Section may within six months, after&apos;the making of the&apos; order appeal to the&quot;Railway Commissioners, who shall have the same power in the matter as if it had been/originally referred to their decision.(5)    The Board of Trade or the Railway Commissioners, as the case&quot;may be,&quot;may rescind or vary any order made by them under this section&quot;&quot;The powers of, the Board&apos;of Trade underbills section ,. now transferred to tho Ilinistor of TransportsAt the time of the passing of the 1883&quot;Act &quot;six&quot;Railway Companies having termini in Lohdon&quot;were under statutory&quot; obligation&quot;to grant special facilities for the conveyance of Workmen,&quot;but in addition five other Companies voluntarily provided such facilities in.London and the neighbourhood&apos;.&apos;   Cheap&apos; workmen*3 fare provisions have been Inserted In a considerable number,of Railway Acts since 1883,      &apos; ; especially those relating to Underground Electric Railways.
APPEHDBC &quot;B&quot;.LIGHT KAMUYB AHD TRAlftMS.FACILITIES GUTTED TO WORKMEN. LIGHT RAILV/AYS.The procedure is for tho Promoters to apply to the Light Railway Commiss loners for an &quot;Order under tho Light Railing Act 1896 i&apos; It &quot;is open to the&apos;Light Railway Commissioners &quot;to insert any &quot;terms they pieaso as to the times that workmen*s trains, if any, should run. *. The Board of Trade Order is an executive one following the enquiry by the Light Railway Commission.I find in the &quot;Model Orders&quot; that on Light Hallways (Tramway Typo) workmen13 carriages are to be run between five in the ovening and eight in the morning.It is not the&apos;usual practice to insert workmenfs fare provisions in Light&apos;Railway Orders authorising Light Railways of the railway type.-TRAMflAYS.Tho&apos; same procedure as regards obtaining powers for construction may be followed as for Light Railways, but the &quot;more usual course now &quot;is for the &quot;Promoters to apply to Parliament, for a Private Act, or to obtain a Provisional Order under the Tramways Act of 1870.It rests with the Light Railway Commissioners or with Parliament&apos;,to mako&apos;such terras qm they please as regards the time of running, if any, of workmen fs trams.&quot;The clauses in &apos;he &quot;Model &quot;Orders&quot; provide &quot;that workmen&quot;^ trams are td be&apos;run between five&quot;in the&quot;evening and eight&quot;in the morning, $xcopt on Saturdays, when the hours are changed from five p.m. to two prm.
APPENDIX w0&quot; Workmenfs travelling facilities on Railways.n Arrangements in operation at the present time.On some lines WorkmenTs tickets are issued wherever application is made, while on others the issue is restricted to certain areas or within certain limits.The hours during which Workmen&apos;s tickets are available vary considerably on the different lines, on some they are available on the forward journey by all trains from the starting station up to the first one after 7.30 a9m*;   on others by trains leaving the-starting station up to 8 a.m.j   and on others by trains arriving at destination, before 8 a.m.     On some lines they.are available by certain specified trains only.With some exceptions the tickets are available for the return journey after 12 noon in the London Area, and after 4 p.m. in the , provinces &apos; (12 noon on Saturdays)..     In exceptional cases such as illness, injury, stress of weather and breakdown of machinery, workmen are allowed to return earlier.The Workmencs &quot;Daily&quot; fares on the majority of the lines are based omthe 3rd class single standard fare for the double journey (i*e. without the 50$ increase), but in many cases they are on a lower basis.     With a view of spreading the traffic as much as possible some Companies charge lower fares by the earlier-morning trains*The following Companies do not issue &quot;Daily&quot; Workmenrs tickets j.*Caledonian; Glasgow &amp; South Western; Hull &amp; Barnsley; Isle of Wight Central; Maryport &amp; Carlisle; Midland &amp; South west Junction;   North British;   Port Talbot:   Rhymney.Workmenfs fares were not increased in January 1917* when the ordinary fares, were raised by 50$, and no increase has since been made.Workmen!s &quot;Weekly&quot; tickets are issued in some cases at five times and in others at six times the dailyfares* &apos;Workmenfs tickets are issued during the specified hours to all persons applying for them.Prior to the War certain Companies granted Weekly WorkmenTs tickets to cover the &quot;Afternoon&quot;, and &quot;Night&quot; shifts on the Employer!s certificate at the same fares as.those in operation for the &quot;Day&quot; shift and this arrangement was adopted by all &quot;Controlled&quot; Companies during the War period in respect of the employees of firms under Government Control, and it is still continued in some cases although these firms are no longer under control.The liability of the Companies under any claim for compen-sation for injury or otherwise in respect of any passenger travell-ing with a Workmen&quot;s. ticket is limited to  100, with the exception that the Caledonian, Glasgow and South Western and Wirral Companies have no such limitation, and. in the case of the Great Eastern Company the limitation applied only in respect of Workmen&apos;s tickets issued at 2cL return^
Draft reference to Rates Advisory Committee under Section 21 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919*(l)       The Minister having determined that Workmenrs fares, which are still on a pre-war &quot;basis, are now generally, unremunerative, the Committee are desired to advise as to the best means of.revising these fares both as regards the rates and the times during which these fares are in operation, in order that the relative passenger traffic may be placed upon a paying basis, having  due regard to the changes that have taken place in industrial and social conditions and in hours of employment since workme&apos;nfs fares were instituted and to the effect of SUch -revision upon railway, tramway and omnibu3 passenger traffic, and also upon housing and labour generally.(2)        In connection with this reference, the whole question of travelling facilities by railway, tramway or omnibus at rates lower than ordinary passenger fares should be reviewed, and the Committee should also advise as to what modifications, if any, should be made in these lower rates concurrently with any revision of workmenrs fares.
