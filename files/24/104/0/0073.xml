SECRET,h5o Document Li \.l:: ..&quot;Hia Driiinnic Maj,oitVjJuayiL&apos;-.MINISTET  OF   FOOD.339atistical Statement for Month of March 1920.fports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in March were generally larger than in the preceding month ; cereals, butter, cheese, and tea showed an improvement, meat remained heavy, but sugar was down again, and bacon imports were small. Apart from seasonal movements of cereals, the stocks position underwent little change.The statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour as on April 1st, show a slight increase in the average retail food prices, the percentage increase since July, 1.914, rising from 133*2 on March 1st to 135&apos;2 on April 1st. The seasonal decreases in milk and eggs, and the reduction in the maximum price of imported mutton were more than counteracted by increases in sugar and potatoes, especially the former.Tabl&apos;e A.
