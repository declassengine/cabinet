This Document is the Property of49His Britannic Majesty^ Government,MKWffMi iiMrUniViA t rwiSi.cabinet H E TtFACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS (BAKEHOUSES) (circulated by the Home Secretary) -----------oOo-----------I circulate to the Cabinet draft of a Bill, entitled &quot;Factories and Workshops (Bakehouses) Bill&quot;, to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of the Ministry of Labour whioh reported last July. The operatives have agitated for the abolition of night work in the baking industry for many years.    During the war the Bread Order issued by the Ministry of Food, which prohibited the sale of bread within twelve hours after its baking, had the effect of practically abolishing night wor&amp;j and a very strong demand was made last year by the Operatives&apos; Associations for the continuance of the prohibition when the Broad Order was repealed. It was not found possible, however, to reach an agreement on the question by negotiations between the representatives of the employers and of the operatives, and the Committee was accordingly appointed to investigate the question.     The Cabinet at its meeting on 26th July decided that effect should be given to the recommendations of the Committee, and the present Bill is being introduced in fulfilment of the pledges whioh have been given that a Bill should be introduced this session.E * S.1st Hay, 1920,
