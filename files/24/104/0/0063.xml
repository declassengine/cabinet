Since I circulated that memoradnum the whole pcsi-tion has been considered by the Home Affairs Committee, &quot;who decided: &quot;(1) To approve the action taken by the Admiralty in re-instating the two established men on the basis- that  . their cases would be considered at some, future date after consultation with the Treasury. (2) That the Admiralty should report to the Committee the result of the negotiations now taking.pi ace for the re-instatement in their Trade Unions of the established workmen who had not struck.&quot; .,. ..That decision was. taken on the 1st March but the whole que&amp;-tion a3 to the treatment of established employees who participate in a strike has been re-opened by the action of the Irish Postal workers who took, part recently in the general strike in Ireland. This case again has , special features, but it is noticeable that such cases are becoming frequent on one pretext or .another.   The whole question will be brought to. a head by the decision of the conference of the union.of Postal Workers which is to be held in May and at- which the Executi ve.Council intend to propose the institution .of a strike policy, as a. permanent element in the programme of the Union. &apos; -1..HHHHI
I do not think that we can postpone a general uecision of this importance for long and we certainly ought to he prepared with a definite policy.   v,lt.h this object in view I would suggest that the Home Affairs Committee should he asked to reconsider the whole subject in the li^ht of the two cases ref err eo. to in order that they may make recommendations to the Cabinet as to the policy to be adopted in future..(intlcu)   A.G.,Treasury, S26th April, 192Q.
