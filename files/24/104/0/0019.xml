Sir Hamar Greenwood . intended to raise again, when a suitable opportunity occurred, the question of theMesopotamia!! oilfields discussed at the Conferonce ofMinisters on the 23rd January, at which he was unable to be present owing to his absence abroad.    The decision thenfareached practically cancelled that of 8th May, 1919, regarding the&apos;Royal Dutch Shell Agreement, an essential feature of which is the allocation to that group of a substantial share in the-Turkish Petroleum Company - a&apos; company reconstituted before the war with the approval &quot;of His Majestyfs Government&apos; for the development of the oil resources of Mesopotamia,    The whole position in regard to these agreements is, of course, liable to be altered as a result of the discussions at San Remo, but as the Cabinet has before it memoranda of the First Lord of the Admiralty and the President of the Board of Trade I desire to place the view of the Petroleum Department on record.in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the leading feature of our petroleum policy for a number of years has been the endeavour to secure British control of the Royal Dutch Shell group.   The Board of Trade gave much attention to the subject and Lord Harcourfs Committee was so much impressed with its urgency that it devoted a very large portion of its time to exploring possible bases of agreement.     If the proposed settlement falls through now, after the principle has been regarded as settled and after many months of discussion on intricate matters of detail, further negotiations on other lines will beimpossibleApart from the acquisition of Government control
Impossible, and I am confident that we shall lose a unique opportunity of getting a real control over one of the two most powerful and experienced oil groups in the world.   I consider that this would be a most disastrous occurrence at the present tine when the whole question of our future oil supplies is causing us such anxiety and when our dependence on foreign controlled fields is such a source of danger,I may mention that in 1914 the shareholding in tho Turkish Petroleum Company was modified with the approval cf His Majesty1s Government and was fixed at 50 per cent Anglo-Persian, 25 per cent Anglo-Saxon (Royal Dutch Shell) and 25 per cent Deutsche Bankt    The Company has always been regarded as still in existence and the Deutsche Bank shares were acquired during the war by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  It is these shares to which the French considered that they should succeed and in negotiations with them the existence of the Turkish Petroleum Company and the validity of its concession were until quite recently accepted on both sides. I fail to see how His Majesty&apos;s Government can now refuse to recognise claims by British and other interests in Mesopotamia, which it accepted and supported before the war.The French have learnt of the proposal of the British Government to exclude private interests froms partici-patlon in the Mesopotamia.! fields, and have now put forward a claim tc^hal f &amp; share, insisting that their previous demand had been limited to one-quartor, only because they understood that the British Government was committed .to recognition of certain private interests.    This claim is certain to be strongly pressed if we refuse to admit the claims based on pre-war negotiations and we may also expect considerable opposition from the United States, which is at present extremelyanxious
anxious about its oil supplies.As regards the oil wealth of Mesopotamia, it should be remembered that this is still entirely unproved, The survey indications are certainly promising and the progress made in Persia encourages hopes of similar success in this neighbouring territory, but proof of the existence of oil in large quantities can only be obtained by sinking wells to a depth considerably greater than has yet been done in Mesopotamia,    Development by private interests would almost certainly result in far more rapid opening up of. the oil resources of the country, and it is probably no exaggeration to say that at least  5,000,000 would have to be spent before any substantial return could be received, so that if the work were undertaken by Government not only would the revenues of the country not benefit for some time to come, but very heavy initial expenditure would have to be incurred.     If the grant of a concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company was confirmed, the Mesopotamian Government could of course impose such royalties and duties as it considered desirable and obtain a large revenue without any risk whatever.     The suggestion that the oilfields should be operated by Government may seem attractive, but the disadvantages of such an enterprise are very considerabl Apart altogether from the question of principle^ the oil business is peculiarly unsuited for Governments to engage in it is speculative, very technical and requires audacity in a exceptional degree. The engagement of the necessary staff alone would be a serious item, as it is practically impossible &apos;to get experts of the proper calibre except by outbidding the large oil companies who are keenly competingat the
at the present time for good men.     If we refuse to carry out terms to which we practically stand pledged as regards the Turkish Petroleum Company we cannot expect to get any assistance from the principal oil interests.On the grounds, therefore, both of policy and of practical expediency I strongly urge that the proposals as regards Mesopotamia, which are embodied in the Anglo-French and the Royal Dutch-Shell agreements, should be carried out forthwith.F.K.22/4.
