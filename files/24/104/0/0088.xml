Tho following are tho views which it is the desire of the Supremo Council to submit for tho consideration !   of that Government.At an early s-ta&amp;e in tho discussions which have boon proceeding with regard to the Turkish Treaty, first in (tendon and afterwards in Paris, an enquiry was addressed by the Allied Conference to tho Council of the League of Nations, who were known to bo greatly interested in the future of Armenia, as to v/Mt&apos;might bo tho degree of assistance that they would be prepared to offer towards the realisation of the independence and security of the projected Armenian State.it was not contemplated to invite the League of Nations itself to assume a Mandate for Armenia for tho sufficient reason that that body is neither a State nor has the army or the finances to enable it to discharge such a duty.     The Council of the League in their reply, while indicating the fullest sympathy with the object of tho Allied Powers, themselves pointed out that this could bast bo assured if either a member of tho League or some other Power could be found willing to.accept the mandate for Armenia.The Supreme Council,: In considering this reply, were at once reminded of the conviction long entertained by thorn that the tnly groat Power:which is qualified alike by itssympathies
syT^atbi-es ani its msrtorial rowcrc-os   to uu&amp;ecrtaktf Khls task t,n behalf of humanity, is America.    It has incised1 been rightly $escribed in Mr, Colby1 s. note as &quot;the demand and expectation of tho civilised world&quot;.     Hor could tho Supreme Council forgot that tho Inclusion of a liberated .Armenia among the objects for which the Allied and Associated Powors fought and won the war, nowhere received more eloquent expression,than in the speeches of President Wilson.Accordingly the Supreme Council new address a definite appeal to the United States  cvernment to aucept the mandate for Armenia,&quot;&quot;&quot;$hey do so not from the smallest desire to evade any obligations which they mi $at be expected to undertake, but because the responsibilities which they are already obliged to bear in connection with tho dissolution of the former Ottoman Empire will strain their own capacities to the Uttermost, and because they believe that the appearance on the scene of a Power emancipated from the prepossessions&quot;of the old world will inspire a wider confidence and afford a firmer guarantee for stability in the future than would the selection of any European..l?ot&apos;er.The United States Government might well enquire, what is the scopo of the obligations which they are invited to accept;   sand this involves the boundaries of the new state     The quostion is one to which it   is in the power of that government itself to formulate a raply.In tho course of the discussions that hove been proceeding there has been   no problem more earnestly debated or more difficult of solution than tho boundaries best consonant with the interests of the Armenian State.     The President of the United States has consistently pleaded the cause of a larger Armenia; considerations with which the President is already familiar have inevitably compelled the partial curtailment of these aspirations;   and tho prospeut of creating an Armenia which should include Oilicla and extend to tho Mediterranean has for long &apos;been.^)arKh^ned as impracticablo.There
There rcmiaJLiuetf -the nuj^UmB tfhirt&apos; jrartriotrs xrf&apos; tlw Ttla^yets of Sr&amp;eroum, Trobisond, Ynn and Bit lie, still in the possession of the Turkish authoriti os. could properly and safely he added to the existing Armenian State of Brivar .and v hat means of access to the sea should be : pro vidod In order to on euro &quot;to tho ne1- Armenia a self sufficing national oxi stone o*    In other &quot;-or ds it remained to bo settled T /hat should be the nxact boundaries&apos; on   the 7est and South which should be inserted in the Peace   Treaty - ith Turkey.   The boundaries of Armenia on the North i/eot^and North and North 3a st with the adjoining States of Georgia and  laorbaijar it is hoped to settle by a mutual agreement bet Don these Republics.   In any case these do not call for mention here.Upon the above questions there was much to be said upon both sides which need not be recapitulated in this Note.&apos;   Suffice it to say that an appeal to tho decision of an independent and absolutely impartial arbiter was recognised as tho best available solution and that it was decided to include in the appeal to the President of tho United States a request to this effect,   whatever may be the answer of the United States Government on   the laraer subject of the Mandate, it is earnest--ly honed that he will in the interests both of Armenia and of the oeac-e of the &apos;3ast-;,accept this honourable obligation.In this expectation it has boon agreed(a) To make an appeal to President Wilson that the United States of America should accept a mandate for Armenia within the limits set forth in Section V of fee first print of the draft Treaty of Peace &quot;ith Turkey.whatever may be the answer of the United states Government(b) That,;    on the subject of then a.nd.ate the President of the United States should be asaed to arbitrate on the boundaries ox Armenia as set forth in the draft article below.(c) That an article in regard to Armenia should be inserted in the Treaty of Peace in the following sen se: -Turkey and Armenia and the other High&apos; Contracting Parties agree to refer to the arbitration of the President of the United States of America the question of the boundary between Turkey and Armenia, in the Vilayets of llrserum, Trebisond, Van and Bit 1 is and to accept his decision thereupon, as well as any stipulations he may prescribe as to access to the sea for the independent state of Armenia.Pending the arbitration, the boundaries of Turkey and Armena shall remain as at are sent.
The boundaries-of ArmaTim-on the north ana east., &quot;that. &apos; is between Armenia and Georgia, an3 &quot;betveen-Armenia and Azerbaijan shall be laid down by the Supreme Council at the some time as those between Armenia and Turkey, failing a spontaneous agreement on this subject bet&quot;eon the three.. Caucasian States;Irrespective of the mandate and tho frontiers, there remaincertain additional considerations to which the Supreme Councilfool impelled to   call the sympathetic attention of the UnitedwhatoverStates Government.     In * hands tho destinies ofArmenia may be placed, an.interval must   inevitably occurtafter tho conclusion of the Treaty with Turkey, in which thosecurity and even the existence of the Hew State will be inperil, unless it can be assured of extraneous aid.     its immediate needs will be two in number - provision   of theitmilitary forces required to defend       against external attack,itand provision of the financial means that will enable        toits    *constitute an orderly administration and to develop ,-t: own economic resources.     In the last resort both of these necessities may be summed up under the heading of financial assistance.The question of military assistance is not thought te beso formidable as might at first sight appear to be the base.The forces at present possessed by the Armenian Republic ofBrrvan have hitherto been to a large extent diverted - if notitsdissipated - in the unfortunate disputes with       neighbourson the north and the east.      \then these are competed - asmay be hoped from an arrangement quite recently concludedbetween the three Caucasian Republics, there will be nothing.    itsto prevent a reconstituted Armenia from devoting &apos; undivided energies to the vindicationi and maintenance of such frontiersas
as may      allotted toThe question has &quot;bean anxljorsjy examined of the -extentto vhich the Allied PorerS might themselves he able by themovement of troops to assure the prompt execution of theterritorial clauses of the Treaty in the region of Armenia.Arms and ammunition are already being provided^but it would raise false hopes on the part both of the Armenians and   oftheir friends in all parts of the world, if it were generally believed that the Allied Powers could themselves spare troops for this purpose.     The response hIIlti.es entailed upon them in addition to their heavy obligations in Europe and eOseVvhire /by the occupation or administration of territories thatformerly ^belonged to the Turkish Empire, and by the necessityof enforcing the Treaty in those   parts of Turkey vhich are more accessible to their arms, will render impossible theassumption of military responsibilities additional to the tremendous burdens they have already assumod.    Unless,therefore, Armenia can obtain immediate assistance from someother Power she will be forced to rely in  the main, so faras military defence is concernedyupon the forces which sheand munitionsalready possesses, augmented by such - instructors/as the Allies can supply.    Were, however, a volunteer contingent or a volunteer corps to be raised for her defence in America or in any foreign country, it would no doubt be a wolcomo and invaluable incentive to her own patriotism.     But the   offer of trained and technical assistance and material aid on   an organised scale by a great civilised state would bo even more opprttune and would enable her to employ her own manhood in her own defence in mi effective way.     It would be of the greatest value to know if tho American Government or the American people will be at all disposed to render her this servico.The &apos;pr!D*vision of credits, however, is even more urgent, The Council   of the league of Nations have had it in mind, we believe, to recommend: the Assembly of tho Loaguo to guaranteea loan
a loan dxaJjrcan^ theLeaguo .     Tho Supreme^ C^runcil -havo of course no knowledge of tho responso that may be returned to., ouch an appeal, if it be ma do.     Bat oven assuming a far board bio reply, an interval must oocur before effective aid could be ?iven in this manner;   it is uncertain whether&apos; the response wnulcJ be adequate to the need;   and in any case the appeal cannot, for reasons which are known, be   addressed to the United States Government.     In these circumstances help might fail to. be forthcoming in the very quarter where sympathy for the future Armenian State is most sincere and active, &quot;here the burdens entailed by the war are believed, to be less onerous than in any of the other recently belligerent c&amp;-.untxias^.and where the resources of a state and-.a.,-aomjiiuni.tya.. at once powerful ano wealthy,, have been least impaired.It Is   not   for the Supreme- Uoui/oil&apos; to suggested-st to the United States Government by what means, whether by state action nr by contributions, public1 or private, the desired,financial^aid to the Armenian Republic could best beV \afforded.     An American loan of a few millions-gt er .li.ngmight be the means of setting Armenia at once u^on her feet On the other hand it is Delia wed thai there are miany * orgauiisarbians and societies in America)., that would glaCl^A \ 1contribute to so excellent a cause.   Jior- should Armenians^ themselves be backward in coming forward in the hour of their countryrs need.   They cannot expect and they do not desire to depend exclusively&quot; upon the mercy or the charity of others.-Wealthy Armenians will, it     is felt sure,, contribute largely\to that resuscitation of their haunt ry for which they have waited so. patiently-and   amid sufferings so cruel and: prolonged-;iand there may well - bo a universal emulation irr-responding toan&quot;V-
ar appeal than which * oiLTre (hs^servijag: can rarol^ hare been addressee1, to the bo art and conscience oi&apos; mankind.It is   not desired to &quot;urge upon the United Btates Government any unreasonable haste in arriving at a decision upon the momentous questions        that have boon submitted to them.   But it -ill be obvious to them that so Ion&quot;.;.; as these matters are held in suspense, the anxieties of Armenia rill be extreme,and the pacification of the Eastern world may be seriously and.even disastrously postponed.It would accordingly be an. immense relief to all tho parties concerned if the United States Government vrere in a position to give as early a reply as may bo convenient to all or any of the cuestions which have here been submitted to them,   Nor can the Supreme Council conclude \ ithout expressing a most earnest hope that that reply may be affirmative&apos; in character.San hemo,26th April, 1920.
