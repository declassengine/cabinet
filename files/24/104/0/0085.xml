Germany is not living up to hor engagements either in tho destruction of tho material of war, or in&apos;the reduction of her effectives, or in the provision of coal, or with regard to reparations, or tho cost of the Army of Occupation.She has given neither satisfaction nor apologies for the assaults to which on several occasions the members of the Allied Hiss ions have been subjected.She has taken no steps, -as was provided for under the &apos; Protocol to the Treaty, towards ascertaining hor liabilities under, the&apos;head of reparation, or towards making proposals for fixing the total amount she should thus pay,   urgent&apos; as is a settlement of this nature in the intWrnst- of all vonoornod. She docs not appear even to he &apos;&apos;considering how she is to mmot her obligations as and when they mature,Tho Allies do not ignore tho difficulties with ^hieh&apos;the German Government is faced, and do not intend to insist upon a

Governments than by an exchange of Kpt.es,.     They have, therefore, decided to invite tho heads of the German Government to confer directly with the heads of the Allied Governments,, and thoy. ask that, when they meet, the Gorman Government will -present to them precise explanations and proposals on all. the matters mentioned above.     If a satisfactory settlement ,is arrived,at.on these points, thc Allied Governments will be willing to discuss with the German representatives any quest ion whi ch affects the internal order and economic well-being of-Germany.,    , ,But Germany must understand that the unity cf the.

Delegation Peris, -Ho. 168 - 20th April, 1920.Monsieur le  resident,By the orders of m;v Government, I have the honourto transit, herewith, e Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Defence&apos; * rmyon the subject of the permanent retention of a. of 200,000 men.Helping on the force of the arguments adduced, the German Government beg the Allied and Associated Governments to be good enough to give their consent to the maintenance of the effectives stated.Please accept,M. le President., the assurance of my highconsideration&apos;.,- -(signed)   Gonpert.His Excellency,M. le Presidentof the isace Conference.Memorandum of the German Minister&apos; of -De fence- on the. Maintenance of an^Arpy ofmm200,000, men..... *According to the Treaty of Peace and the Allies&apos; Note of the 18th February, 19.30, Germany is-bound to reduce her army, by the ,10th July, 1920 to an effective of 100,000 men and to have realised by this date the organisation of the troops which Is set forth in the Treaty.    XTo modification of this organisa-tion will be permitted until such time as Germany be- admitted into the League of nations which subsequently.will be able to authorise such       modifications as should, appear desirable,
N&amp;c conditions   imposed on Gomany arc: to rs 11-.? first step in -th^reistTl-o^ts^ of armament ingeneral; and the realisation of this disaraiament is one   of tho first duties of the League of IT at ions..I,    Admitting that  ihe League of Nations will &quot;be *apahlt Of protecting its   membord against ,the ag;;rcnsion of its neighbours, the effective armed forces of a $tate should \)c calculated fi*st and foremost   on the basis of tho internal situation of that State,   &quot;he events of the last few days have clearly shown how shaky is the political, foundation on which Germany rests..-   These events .have *mce more and in the gravest way shaken.the political and eoonomit situation.   The troops at the dis75*sal of the German Government for the ouiDnressi oncf di sobers provoked by the Extremists en the right and   left, will as regards the re-establishment   of political and aaonomic order scarcely,suffine.to re-establish the power   of the -Government and stabilise it if there is no extension of the centres of.agination and if the .parts of Germany which have hitherto been quiet, continue to remain so... Further, it.will be   only by remaining indisputable masters of the., situation, that the Government will b? able to compel the rabels to give Viji the arms whioh ase illegally in. their possession.   It, is certain that the Bolshevik element of tho German population were, not prepared for the -outhreak of the reactionary coup d&apos;etat at   the   moment when it   occurred.   They therefore had   not&apos; the time to concentrate all the revolutionaryelements for an onergetia and well conducted reply.   However, their reaction assumed dimensions wh,ieh were surprising and  roved a solid organisation.   If these elements on their part, assume the initiative of a revolution,, it   is to be feared that this move would breax out still more vigorously and simultaneously throughout Germany.
It ^culd/^G^ dangerous   illusion co imagine&quot;&quot;that the re-Gstabllshmont   of order has -&quot;lUnally-c^r/xr-oJ -r;d&quot; the danger   of a r9Tolution0   In view of the Bolshevik oonotion   whioh may he noted to seme extent eveirywhrrej   in vi ew beoidco of Germany&apos;s economic situation,whioh   continues to.&quot;be extremely delicate, an appreciable improvement in the internal&apos; situation in not for a long time /to be hoped for.   After, as before,- the fire will continue- to smoulder on the. numerous, revolutionary hearths &quot;of Germany, tho olt-mraris of disorder will Continue   to do their best to make the; flames blaze up, to extend their propaganda to the peaceful parts of Germany, and to excite their population against the present   order of. things.   They  will find besides the ground well prepared in   consequence of the difficulties of the economic situation,.  -Tn that in to be added the fact that   no consist ant and certain-appreciation&apos;of the various political ideas ha?, yet taken root in the great mass of the people * Incidents ef little importance, carelessnesses and mi stokes may determine) in.the futuro also an unexpected and&apos;ccmplete &apos;change in tho feelings of the   masses, and confront the Government with*now; difficulties .     Celoquently, it   is necessary that the Government uhould have at   their disposal a means of. preventing thereby revolutionary attempts,    or of suppressing them at onoe should they none the less occur.Sale   means cannot be   other than an. adequate military force,&quot;    In view   of the actual conditions, it   is inconceivable that-   one   hundred thousand men can be enough to maintain the Government of .&apos;k nation of sixty millions,     Besides, the lack pf adequate military forces would turn out to the disadvantage of the Allied Governments, because tho German Government would ,.find   it   Impossible to conform th stipulations of an economic nature..-    Police forces- oannot replace the army.,   They cannot&apos;. be        -    i

The map   hereto attached shows how far the different units of an army of one   hundred thousand7men would be dispersed through the entire country.   The   proposal to surround the centres of agitation with garrisons was recognised to be   imprant ir-ablc because   it would have involved the ^complete stripping of vast regions ef troops.   If, in consequence, cf the reduction of the army to one hundred thousand men it is ne cesnary to establish garrisons of troopc in the manner   indicated on the above mentioned map, the result would be an exaggerated breaking up of the effectives,, considerable difficulties in concentrating the troops for a common action and the necessity of entrusting important, territorial powers to subaltern officials.   It is olear that in oaso of disorders suddenly breaking   out on..a large scale such an army could never bo effective and   its action would be doomed to failure by the very fashion in which it would be brought about.     According to tho organisation, set forth, for the army of one hundred thousand men it   is necessary for the .. case of disorders &quot;for entrust to the superior   officers ... territorial  powers extending over such vast districts that these Commanding   Officers&apos; would not from the points where, they were stationed be able to control their measures. &apos; Contact and  , understanding with the local authorities would   often be difficult if not. impossible.     In many oases, consequently, any central direction of&quot; operations would be   impossible. . The nine superior commands set forth by .the Treaty of Peace are, . then, insufficient....,The
Thc doubling -cf &quot;&quot;the- e iTCcx favour vo^oet forth  above.   It would bo possible to   cover tho country witha closer network of garrisons and above all considerably forces could be got together in the neighbourhood of the control.&apos; ofincreaseddisorder,,   The   fcje^xari- number of   commands permits a reduction of  he   territorial districts of the different Commanding Officers and in this way   better communication with the civil autboritiea .The presence of suoh an army will&apos;prevent from the beginning any revolutionary tendency, it will protect working men of good intentions against the terrorists, furthermore, its effect will be to bring about the re-birth of economic life and permit it to develop freely without political tendency,     An army of two hundred thousand men will be more or less if not completely adequate for the demands of the internal situation.     In/present circumstances a reduction of the armed forces would bring about grave consuquenoes,   The ocup d&apos;etat of the Extremists on the Right has only been possible beoause a Corps of troops   was found which allowed itself to be seduced.     The Corps whioh put itself at the dicposal of the conspirators was   about to be dissolved &apos; in virtue of the stipulations of the Peaoe Treaty,     The intention was certainly to aid these troops, to overcome the difficulties in whioh they  would be   involved, but the conspirators   none the less found complacent ears,   Tho Government saw themselves forced by tha conditions of peace to turn into the street   men and officers to whom they hid appealed&quot; in the distressing moments   of the Spring of 1919,   It was easy for the conspirators to put a false complexion on the fact that the Government could take no other oourse.     This event showed that the German Government have been   confronted with an almost insoluble task in the demand being addressed to them in present circumstances to dissolve further bodies of troops.     The soldier v:no has engaged expects to be for a certain time free from the eoonomio battle of life.-

Tho Covenant   of tho League of Nations foresees ageneral disarmament&apos; of all tho states.   It accordance &quot;1th theTreaty.of Peace Germany must disarm first.   She has fulfilledthis duty,, but so far her example has not been followed by anyof the Allied or neutral States.     The League of Nations has   notyet taken any sort   of decision in this respect, and yet thisought to be its first bare.Even leaving Germany in possession of an army of two hundred thousand men there could be   no fear that she couldemploy them cither for defence or attack against a foreign Power.An army reduced, to those   numbers will bo   able to repulse raidsof small   contingents and of bands of irregulars; it will alsobe able with the support of the existing fortifications toprovide for tho protection of the; frontier for a short space oftime and up to a certain degree, but   it would be absolutelyinadequate as  ai arm of defence against an enemyiinvasionelaborately prepared.     3o much the more an army of two hundred.thousand men with no   reserves at its disposal and with its..rm;iment submitted to restrictions of a character set forthby the Treaty of Peace cennot in any way bo employed on an offensive and th.it all the less inasmuch as, precisely at a mount of foreign complications, numerous forces would bo   needed in tho interior of Germany for the   maintenance of order and oftho legal   administration..III... Neither the   German  Government nor those   of thelose in allied countries would cfcjjjcbjcgt any advantage txwi   seeing   theconstitution   of an army   of one   hundred thousand men postponedto
to a   later&apos;date by which time the situation ojl-Jji jGermariynriight be consolidated.    The-cohesion and solidity of the army are gravely oompron.ised.ljy the&apos;&quot;uncertainty&apos; of the future of its members..   It is   impossible at present to ohoo3e the troops to constitute the army of one   hundred thousand, men, because in this oase the remainder feeling sure of being shortlydismissed   would lose all their value and Instead of a  protection would beoome   a danger for the Government and public order. It is   indispensable to take without delay final measures to settle the organisation of the army and the future   of its  members, otherwise   it will be impossible to count   on it as a protecting el erne nt,   The consequences whioh. would result for Germa n;/^ail Burons might be Incalculable.IV.    If Germany were permitted the permanent possession of an army of two hundred thousand men the organisation of this should be in conformity with the 3?eaoe Treaty.   Only the units should be double those set forth by the Treaty.   The result would be an effective of four general aommands, fourteen infantry  divisions and six cavalry divisions.   Germany in consequence of its impoverishment and its economic situation which has been gravely compromised is not in a position tea support the great expenses, necessitated by the upkeep of si: divisions   of cavalry and the German Government would therefore propose in place of this three new Cavalry divisions and three new infantry units,.    The effectives of eight thousand officers and of one   hundred and   ninety t^vo thousand men would, then, be divided among four general   commands, twelve infantry divisions,, three cavalry divisions and five infantry brigades. The first three units would correspond to those set forth by the Peaoe Treaty..   The brigades would be organised like the divisions, but they  would not have artillery commanders or parks, and would only count two infantry regiments and two   artillery groups.On
p.On the   other  kanch. the^cvea.rm^the. f ttllorririfC^ /h men t9 of spe 0 j a 1 aims ;For eaoh of the four infantry divisions a  battalion of heavy artillery comprising two &quot;batteries ccurbe and one Tfattery 4 tir raoant, further a total of eight groups of airmen and of four railway   companies,,   In justification of these formations which would all he included in&quot;the effective of two hundred thousand&quot;men, see Annex 2,   The proposed division cf effectives resulting therefrom is shown in Annex 3,Thcso prop&amp;sals spring from the desire to procure for Germany the most indispensable guarantee to assure  her development against possible disorders whether internal or external and to put her in a position to proceed unfettered to   the reconstruction of her economic life.   They represent the minimum of the means which should be at the disposal of the German Government desirous to direot aright the efforts they are making to conform to the demands of the Tease Treaty, They are, then, justified not only by the interests of Germany but also by those of the Allied Governments.
Annex____&amp; 391A treatise on the reasons for maintaining formations of heavy artillery gangs for railway work and also, for the time being, of aviators. L&quot;Heavy Artilipry.Experience has shown,  chiefly during the recent battles, that one is not obl:&apos; to dispense with heavy artillery even during civil wars.     The rebels are considerably superior in numbers to tho Government troops, they make use of heavy guns,, and profit by their war experience in building earthworks.     Against this advantage the Government troops must be able to oppose combative methods of equal value or even more powerful, which must be immediately available in order to crush the morale of its adversaries at tho very beginning.    Heavy guns alone are able to accomplish this task,   a few rounds from heavy artillery can silence any resistance at the lowest price.     The troops must have these weapons at their disposal in order to use them should occasion ariso. .   In most oases where it is neaessary to take the guns from fortresses or from other places one .is apt to miss the opportunity of using them to advantage.   Tho defence of frontiers relies also upon heavy artillery, because all eastern neighbours and the Rod. Armies of Russia possess similar armaments.Gangs for Railway -fork.The efforts of the revolutionary elements are that they aim at political results, endeavouring to hinder the movements of troops in the first place by paralysing movements by rail.   If they succeed in this a prompt concentration of troops is rendered impossible andthe army is unable to re-establish any degree of order or tranquility in the country.     Prom this it is an inevitable necessity/ in view of movements of troops, to have on one&apos;s strength railway gangs,.thanks to whom a service can be maintained and who are capable of repairingdamage to the permanent way.Flying Services.Por the time being., until thc internal conditions are con-solidatcd., small detachments of aeroplanes which arc able to perform
1 &apos;392 1k the following duties are proponed:-the(l)   To ensure communications and/lranaport of supplier, and personnel in the event of a &quot;breakdown or rtepp^ of the usual methods at communication, o, g. rail, telephone,, telegraph.(2)   Tc supply, encourage and warn the population &quot;by dietributm$ information.(3)   tfo follow and watch the movements of enemies of the state as well as the movements of their own troops, that are taking part in street fighting.Add^jU VJhen the railways are interfered with and telephonic and telegraphic oommuniaation is &apos; cut off headquarters must have a sure means of being able to send out its orders and its supplies. Only the oriator can fulfil this role, therefore he is indispensable in the suppression of internal disorder.MoV 2* A prompt appearance of aircraft circling above centres of trouble and towns in revolt, the dropping of leaflets announcing the imminent arrival of troops, the show of force against armed resistance, the menace of severe punishment in case of outrages agains&quot; public property, all contribute to demoralise the rebels and reassure the friendly population,   By/--cans frequently troubles of this sort have been nipped in-the bud and the hot bed of insurrection has been isolated.   False rumours and anti*government propaganda spread by rebel agitators, the denial of which by posters they have prevented by foroe,  can easily be re ?tifled by the distribution of foreign newspapers, communiques and government explanations,Addy 3* In undo takings against a revolutionary city aviators are indispensable for        supplying headquarters and troops wich information on the subject of the measures of the rioters&apos; as well as that necessary for the control of the movements of the troops,The search for artillery positions, mine throwers,,   . f/.i: snipers on roofs, machine guns, observation of artillery fire and of mines cannot be made in street fighting except by means of air observation^     Dealing with an army limited in its movements, such as Germany will possess in its future, direct intervention of aeroplanes in fighting acquires immense importance..   Without
bloodshed armed rioters in rebellious towns ftavo often been dispersed merely by the appearance of a few machine guns, instozd of by t.1io entry of government 110ops.     Insurgent bands poorly organised are easily cowed by the sight of aircraft, detachments of our own croons isolated or cut off have often been able, to obtain through aeroplanes information, orders and instructions, as well as supplies and ammunition.     Civilian aviators cannot be employed in these tasks, amongst other reasons besauce in times of political stress it is impossible to count on them with certainty.     Por the greatest undo::taking of all was when the German Republic on account of the general strike in March was obliged to suspend its service from Berlin to &quot;Jo5mar.   Therefore intim.es of trouble the military aviator is only politically neutral and independent of every civil organisation, i-e, the transport workers&apos; Union.   He offers a sure means ci transport and conveyance of infomat ion in the hands of th army.    The services of a single maclcine which in three months was able to convey about 500 despatches., representing flights over a distance of 80v000 kilometres, shows that in this respect one can only rely on military aviators,    Certain official English organise.-tions have often be-sn compelled to resort to the necessity and the legitimate employment of military aviators in times of internal trouble.    This employment has equally been recognised as necessary by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army of Occupation of the. 4th Zone of the Rhine Provinces, the Lieut.-General Hichelot.   By a list Io* 314/lV Bureau of 3th October 1919, authority is given to the German Commander of Sera ion I of the Neutral Zone to employ a squadron of six machines in case of serious trouble,.   In the same sense some representatives of the Inter-Allied Commission expressly reserved I right at a mooting held in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Bcrli on the 3rd October, 1919, to create a military service for aerial ocnimunioat ion towards Berlin in case of strikes, etc   The urgent Journey of Colonel Tidbury from Upper Silesia to Berlin on 20th October, 1919) had to bo carried out by means of a Gorman military
aeroplane on account of th* state of unrest and the slowness of other moans of comma rii cation.   &quot;Each group of aviators would only need to -possess 10 machines-     The armament of machines with machine guns on fixed mountings is expressly forbidden.&apos;    Only in case of special to,chnioal duties in case of internal trouble each group of aviators will be supplied with 15 machine guns and a small number of bombs,
