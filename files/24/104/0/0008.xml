Following telegram has been received from Dobbs 1/S., 17th April:  H n I r     &quot; First meeting of Conference this morning lasted for three hours.  In opening I J it i   I discussion I made clear that there can be no departure from mode of proceeding of ^*      &quot;Rawalpindi Conference, namely, that until we are satisfied of sincere desire of Afghanistan for friendship, negotiations for further treaty cannot be undertaken. Object of present discussion is to give Afghans opportunity for explaining such of their actions since peace treaty as have made us doubt their desire for our friendship and of representing to us any matters regarding which misunderstandings may have accumulated on their side regarding British policy towards themselves.   After a good deal of discussion it was agreed that following are main preliminary points regarding which either side desire explanations :-&quot; On the part of British Government: &quot; (1) Afghan anti-British propaganda and incitement among our tribes.&quot; (2) Apparent readiness of Afghanistan to lend herself to Bolshevik policy as corridor through which Bolshevik can send anti-British emissaries and propaganda both amongst our tribes and into India.&quot; On the part of Afghan Government: &quot; (1) British attitude in and regarding Khilafat question and Turkey which Afghan delegates declare interests them and other neighbouring Mahomedan nations more deeply than any other question.&quot; (2) British intentions regarding Pa than tribes on British side of frontier.&quot; (3) Real British intentions regarding independent status of Afghanistan.&quot; Next meeting fixed for Monday. Discussion has so far been free and temperate. Most notable feature was incidental but definite statement by Mahmud Tarsi that Afghanistan wishes henceforth to abandon policy of isolation and to allow free intercourse between herself and other nations.&quot;
