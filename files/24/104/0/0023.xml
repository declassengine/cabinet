General. Nil.Part II. Departmental.The Training of Disabled Men.The latest reports from the local officers of the Ministry show that considerable progress has been made both in the provision of the necessary facilities and in actually bringing men into training. On the 1st April a little over 21,000 men were in training in the United Kingdom. The increase during the first quarter of 1920 has been very considerable. At the beginning of December, 1919, the number of disabled men in training had not yet reached 14,000, and at the end of the month, at which date attention was last directed to the subject in this Report, the total in round figures was 17,000. More than twice as many men are now in training than,was the case at the close of July, 1919, eight months ago, when the Ministry of Labour became fully responsible for the work and had begun to overcome the difficulties of the period of transition. During this time over 7,000 men have completed their training and passed out into industry. A little less than 11,000 men had finished their training under the Ministry of Pensions by the 31st July, 1919. The Government therefore have been responsible already for the industrial training of approximately 18,000 disabled men.(C 1988)  150 4/20  h &amp; S 2 B
III. Labour and Socialist Press.The Socialist Movement.The decisions of the Independent Labour Party conference at Glasgow with regard to the international affiliations of the party are again a noticeable topic of discussion, and the principal writers to the I.L.P. papers Mr. Philip Snowden in. the &quot;Labour Leader/&apos; Mr. Ramsay Macdonald and &quot; Rob Roy &quot; in &quot; Forward &quot; give their opinions on the matter. None of these writers are pleased with the decisions. Mr. Philip Snowden points out that the I.L.P. is left in a thoroughly ambiguous position. The only formal connection the party has at present with any international socialist movement is through the affiliation of the Labour Party to the Second International, and yet the decision of the national Conference was emphatically against connection with this International. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald goes further than Mr. Snowden in pointing out the weakness, of the I.L.P. decision. He declares that the relations of the I.L.P. with the Labour Party during the war could not be tolerated in ordinary times. If this difference between the I.L.P. and the Labour Party with regard to the Second International is maintained, a secession from the Labour Party will be the inevitable conclusion : and this split in the Labour Party, Mr. Macdonald fears, will be followed by a split in the I.L.P.   Mr. Macdonald claims that the at the same time the number of men who have applied for training, but for whom it has hitherto not been possible to provide places, is still very considerable. The aggregate waiting lists for the United Kingdom amount approximately to 27,000.The position varies considerably in various parts of the country. In the East Midlands area, where some 1,250 men are in training, there are only about 340 applicants for whom places have not been found; in the West&apos; Midlands there are nearly 1,870 men in training as against 470 in the waiting list; in Scotland nearly 2,240 men are training as against 835 on. the waiting list; and in Wales nearly 1,480 as against 805. On. the other hand in most of the Southern areas and in the North of England the disproportion remains much greater. Thus in the London area there are still more than 4,000 men awaiting training as against 3,400 in training ; in the South-Eastern area nearly 3,780 as against 1,560; in the Yorkshire area 1,580 as against .1,780; and in the North-Eastern area, 1,720 as against 490. In Ireland, where despite the very great difficulties of the task nearly 1,200 men are in training, over 2,300 are still on. the waiting lists.It is believed, however, that these waiting lists include the names of a fair number who, on examination, will be found not to require training or to be unfitted for it. Investigations are now being made throughout the country to secure the removal of such candidates from the lists. Close co-operation in this work is being maintained between the Training Department and the Local Employment Committees attached to the Exchanges.The development of the Government Instructional Factories, in which it is possible to train large numbers of men in various trades at one and the same time, and to train them under conditions approximating closely to the industrial conditions under which they will subsequently work, is being pressed forward as rapidly as possible. The Ministry is now in possession of 57 such factories. Twenty-four have been &quot;acquired since the beginning of the year, which represents an addition of almost 5,000 training places to the total of 15,000 in the factories controlled by the Ministry at the end of last year. The Govern-ment Instructional&apos; Factory accommodation is now over eight times as extensive as on the 1st May, 1919. These factories afford the greatest hope of a rapid extension of training facilities, although much is still&apos; being done by placing men for training in technical schools or with private employers. Only 27 of the factories are actually in operation. Even after the Ministry has obtained possession, the question of equipment has frequently proved one of special difficulty, while adaptations of the premises are in many cases unavoidable, and in many trades it is necessary to wait for the approval of the training schemes by a Local Technical Advisory Committee before opera-tions can be begun. Of these difficulties-, that of equipment is the greatest, and while considerable progress has been made recently, a good deal still remains to be done. A little more than 3,000 men. are at present in training in the Instructional Factories, leaving nearly 17,000 places which will be available for additional trainees. Some additions to the list of Instructional Factories will be found necessary, hut, by the time all those already acquired have been brought into full operation, adequate provision will probably have been made for by far the greater part of the Ministry&apos;s work.
Second International as representing a body of socialist thought is still very much alive, and that the whole genius of the I.L.P. is with it. He objects to the adulation of Moscow which was such a feature of the speeches of the I.L.P. extremists at Glasgow, and roundly attacks the Independent Socialists of Germany for wrecking the international socialist movement in pursuance of a domestic quarrel with the Majority Socialists. &quot; Rob Roy &quot; is also of the opinion that there is much that the Second International can still do, and would prefer to stick to its organisation rather than to&apos; experiment in the formation of a Fourth International. &quot; Rob Roy &quot; attacks the Moscow communists for their policy, with regard to the socialist movement in Western Europe, of divide el impera.Complaints that the delegates to the I.L.P. conference were, in many cases, bound by instructions from their branches were frequent last week. This week Mr. Philip Snowden repeats the complaint.The attacks upon the I.L.P. in the more extreme journals continue. The only new developments are that the &quot; Socialist,&quot; which usually refrains from criticism of other socialist bodies, joins in the criticism, and that the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; publishes a long letter from a member of the I.L.P., who is a believer in the Third International, and who writes a critical commentary upon the speeches of the I.L.P. leaders at Glasgow. The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; the organ of the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, is always noticeablef or its bitter attacks upon all other Socialist papers and movements. This week special attention is paid to the&apos;co-operative movement and it is urged that communist groups should be formed among the employees of co-operative societies in order that the completeness of the revolution may not be marred by the survival through the revolutionary era of the co-opera-tive organisation. The articles in this paper which are not attacks of this kind, are devoted, not to expounding the principles of constructive socialist policy, but to history. Tins week a series of articles commence, the purpose of which is to outline episodes of the class war in the years 1914-1918.The more violent tone of the &quot; Socialist,&quot; referred to above, may perhaps be attributed to the Easter conferences of this party. Concurrently with the official conference at Carlisle there was held an unofficial conference at Nottingham of S.L.P. insurgents organised by Messrs. Paul, Bell and MacManus and the principal article in this paper is a trenchant attack upon these men, who wish to sacrifice the strict Marxian principles of the S.L.P. for the sake of so-called Communist Unity, which means an amalgamation of the British Socialist Party, Workers&apos; Socialist Federation, South Wales Socialist Party, and those members of the S.L.P. who are willing to compromise with the B.S.P. on the question of political action.It will thus be seen that the Easter conferences of the various socialist movements have had a somewhat disturbing effect, and the feeling is beginning to be prevalent that the whole movement is losing effectiveness through these internal dissensions, and these discussions upon matters far removed from practical politics. Mr. Philip Snowden suggests that the I.L.P. should now leave the question of international affiliation for investigation by the headquarters of the party : &quot; in the meantime there is plenty of work for the I.L.P. to do in converting the public to socialism.&quot; &quot; Rob Roy,&quot; too, expresses a similar opinion. This need for propaganda amongst non-socialists, in place of domestic heresy hunts, has been realised by &quot; Justice &quot; and the &quot; Clarion.&quot; The &quot; Clarion &quot; contains the first of a series of articles which are intended to formulate a definite policy for the Labour Party and ee Justice &quot; insists upon the need for socialist propaganda properly so-called. The mines nationalisation campaign is criticised as being far too superficial in character to be of any permanent benefit.The Trade Union Movement.Comments upon recent wage movements on the part of miners, railwaymen, transport workers and cotton textile workers are frequent. The common opinion is that these movements towards increases in nominal wages will have little effect upon the real wages of the workers. Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; the C! Nation &quot; and the &quot; New Age &quot; all join, in suggesting that the trade union movement should unite in a campaign designed to reduce prices. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses, in a special article, the recent a ward * of the Industrial Court with regard to wages in the engineering and shipbuilding trades. The article is based upon the fact that the Engineer-ing and National Employers&apos; Federation had protested against the award on the ground that it was irregular and ultra vires and upon&apos;the rumour that the Industrial Court was going to hold a special session to consider these objections.  It is maintained that the terms* Award No. 180.
of the award mark a revolution in industrial arbitration. &quot; What the Court has done is to apply, under conditions which happen on this occasion to be advantageous to the workers, the theory and practice of capitalist profit-making to the determination of the wages of labour.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; does not approve of this new departure in that its adoption as a general principle would bring Labour more completely within the orbit of the Capitalist system and would treat,Labour as another form of Capital. Some desul-tory remarks are then made upon the lot of the industrial arbitrator. It is suggested that the arbitrator cannot hope to apply a just principle while the whole system of wealth distribution in the community is fundamentally unjust. The opinion, of this paper is that the community must recognise the urgent need for a radical redistribution of the national income, and that until this need is realised by all parties, &quot; arbitrators will continue to flounder and patched-up wage settlements which settle nothing will be the rule.&quot; Two points in. connection with this article are worthy of note. One is that this journal would appear to have adopted a permanently pessimistic attitude towards the industrial situation. Last week it was noted that this paper had no hope that anything but industrial trouble would result from the report of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry. The other point is that the &quot; New Statesman &quot; is showing a tendency to adopt, in a some-what crude form, the ideas put forward week by week in the &quot; New Age.&quot; One example this week is this talk about redistribution of the national income, and another example occurs in a reference to the miners&apos; ballot and high prices. &quot; The main causes&quot;of high prices to-day lie in the operation of the financial system in relation to currency and credit.&quot; In connection with Mr. Bevin&apos;s remarks upon Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry, which were dealt with in this report last week,* it is interesting to note that the trade union correspondent of the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; in a discussion of the relations between the rank and file of a Trade Union and their officials, insists that &quot; most of the troubles of trade union executives are due to their members not being properly informed of the pros and cons of their business.&quot; He suggests that there is urgent need in all the large trade unions for an efficient intelligence and publicity service to keep the rank and file and the officials in touch with each other.Foreign Affairs.Three articles in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; are interesting as showing the present tendency of I.L.P. policy. The leading article refers to the Anglo-French difference with regard to the occupation of Frankfort and neighbouring towns. In this article the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; declares that it does not share the view that a breach of the Anglo-French Alliance would be an international disaster ; on the contrary, this paper thinks that such a breach would have beneficial results. A catalogue of these results is given :  Great Britain would be released from .her subjection to French diplomacy and mili-tarism ; the Peace Treaty would have to be revised ; France would be put in her proper place among European nations. More significant, however, than this leading article are an anonymous article on the cotton textile industry and an article by Mr. H. N. Brailsford on the condition of Central Europe. Mr. Brailsford deals with the reported American scheme for the relief of Central Europe by providing it with raw materials to be manufactured on a &quot; commission basis.&quot; Mr. Brailsford protests that if such a scheme were allowed to operate for a few years, &quot; Central Europe will be one huge colony working for the victorious allies, but above all for America.&quot; The anonymous article on the textile industry refers to the resolution adopted by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce in favour of a return to the pre-war hours of labour in the interests of increased production. It is urged in this article that the purpose of this resolution is to forestall Germany in world markets and to prevent Germany taking advantage, if this be possible, of the present rates of exchange. &quot; The people of Central Europe are to starve, while the British working-classes work to pile up profits for the Capitalists.&quot; These two articles are obviously contradictory, but they show the opinion of the I.L.P. that the inevitable policy of the Allied and Associated Powers will be to exploit the present situation of Central Europe in the interests of Allied capitalism. Measures for the rehabilitation of the economic condition of Central Europe will only meet with I.L.P. approval in so far as they operate through a definite revision and alteration of the Treaties of Peace.Two articles in &quot; The Call &quot; may also be noted as showing the position of the British Socialist Party towards foreign affairs. Mr. F. Willis, in this paper, devotes an article to extravagant praise of the Soviet Government of Russia. One item in his compilation of beatitudes is significant: &quot; Russia alone will be able to get the increased production* See pages 181-2.
which is so vitally necessary to the world.&quot; The second article is one by Mr. T. Quelch on the topic &quot; Hands off Germany.&quot; This article is exactly similar to the articles which were appearing a year ago on the topic &quot; Hands off Russia.&quot;Ireland.The development of the Irish general strike occurred too late last week to receive full notice in the Labour and Socialist Press. It may be noted, however, that the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; both agree that the present state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue and that the only effective way of dealing with the situation is to admit the principle of self-government for Ireland in all its implications. &quot; The Call,&quot; like all the extreme socialist papers,,is suspicious of Irish nationalism. This week the Irish people are urged to settle their religious and racial differences in order that they may &quot; fall into line in the Federation of free peoples,&quot; by which apparently is meant &quot; take part in international communism.&quot;Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The question of wages continues to be the element of outstanding importance in the labour situation. Negotiations have been taking place with regard to the wage demands of miners, building trades operatives, railwaymen, tramwaymen, omnibus workers, dock workers, bakers, textile operatives, teachers, postal employees and many other classes of workers. In some instances, notably in the case of the miners, a settlement has been reached. In other cases, negotiations are following a normal course, but the issues in such industries as the railways and the cotton textile trade are of a serious and far-reaching nature.A revival of interest is being shown in various matters of importance apart from demands for increased wages. The question of the international affiliation of labour and Socialist bodies continues to arouse controversy, the necessity for a general staff for Labour is again being emphasised, and the whole question of trade union organisation is exciting discussion at labour meetings and in the Labour and Socialist Press.The Unemployment Position.The reduction in the number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged for the week ended the 19th April, 1920, was 10,522, compared with a reduction of 15,883 between the 26th March and the 1st April. The number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 9th April was 214,103-211,643 by men and 2,460 by women.75,219 unemployment books remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 9th April, making a reduction of 3,473 since the 1st April. At the latter date there were 52,533 books lodged by males and 26,159 by females (a total of 78,692).At the 2nd April, 1920, 140 policies remained lodged by short time workers, of which 99 were in the insured industries (chiefly engineering and ironfounding) and 41 in the uninsured. At the week ended the 26th March, there were 260 short time policies remain-ing lodged and 621 at the 5th March, 1920, a month ago.At the 9th April the Employment Exchange live registers show : 288,023 men, 46,023 women, 24,350 juveniles, compared with 290,472 men, 47,382 women, 21,149 juveniles a week ago (the 1st April) and 340,195 men, 54,069 women, 20,758 juveniles a month ago (March 12th).Committee on Increased Production in Industry.The Committee have now held two meetings. At the first meeting, the Committee decided that, as a first step in their inquiry, it would be necessary for them to have data as to -methods of ensuring a high standard of production that existed in certain industries and that accordingly information should be obtained as to the position, in the first place, in the cotton and a few other industries, and further, that the Ministry of Labour should be asked to frame a questionnaire for circulation to the principal associations and firms in the industry.   At the second meeting, a draft questionnaire was(C 1988) 2 B 3
t)194approved and it was left to the chairman to make the necessary arrangements, in con-sultation with the Ministry of Labour, as to the precise sections of industry to which the questionnaire should be sent and as to the procedure for securing early replies.The Nationalisation of the Mines.Now that a settlement has been reached on the question of the miners&apos; wage claim, there is a prospect that the campaign for the nationalisation of the mining industry may be revived. A meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and the Labour Party, was held at the House of Commons on the 21st April, and the position with regard to the demand for nationalisation was considered. It will be remembered that at the special Trades Union Congress when it was decided not to strike to secure nationalisation, it was resolved that steps should be taken to secure nationalisation of the mines by means of a campaign of intensive propaganda. Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, writing recent)); in the &quot; Western Mail,&quot; confesses to a grave doubt whether there is that intelligent grasp of what nationali-sation means, or that enthusiastic desire for it, among the rank and file which would induce the miners to take up the fight with sufficient determination to break down the existing system, but thinks that probably there is need to continue for some years yet an educa-tional propaganda in favour of nationalisation, even among the miners themselves. It may be noted that a meeting of the Sheffield District Anti-Nationalisation Committee (not a Labour organisation) was recently held at which the main business was the con-sideration of a special campaign against nationalisation of coal, steel and other industries, arrangements for the distribution of literature and the holding of a series of educational open-air meetings.The Building Guild Movement.It is reported that the Manchester Building Guild has taken steps to constitute itself an officially recognised legal entity. Its officers and committee in Manchester have become the directors of a company, and the Guild will be able to enter into contracts like any ordinary concern except that profit making is not its object. At Burnley and Nelson, and at Swinton and Pendlebury, negotiations between the local authorities and the Building Guild have recently been opened in connection with artisan housing schemes. It is announced that Highgate Town Council contemplate building about 100 houses by direct labour. The local branch of the Federation of Building Trade Operatives has passed a resolution to the effect that it is prepared to find the labour. One of the con-ditions is that the Federation should have power over the labour during the carrying out of the scheme.The General Staff for Labour.There has been during the week a revival of interest in the proposals which were made after the railway strike last autumn for the formation of a General Staff for Labour. Mr. Fred Bramley, Secretary of the Co-ordination Sub-Committee which was appointed last autumn, announces that a meeting of this committee will be called in a few days to consider details of the scheme, and the final proposals will be submitted to the Trades Union Congress at Portsmouth in September. It will rest with the Congress to decide as to the final method to be adopted for making the Trade Union Movement more efficient, and for facilitating methods for dealing with emergencies. Mr. Gosling has argued in favour of a General Staff for Labour on the ground that employers and all the forces of Capital act together and Labour must do likewise through the medium of a General Staff. He insists that the General Staff must be controlled democratically, and its purpose will not be to call strikes but to assist in times of dispute. Mr. Bevin and Mr. Robert Williams have also advocated the formation of this Staff.Amalgamation.It is announced that the. Rules Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has completed its report and a general delegate conference of the six affiliated unions will commence at York on the 27th April to consider the adoption of the new rules. The National Brassworkers and Metal Mechanics at a meeting in London on the 18th April, passed a resolution to support the scheme of amalgamation with the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The national delegate meeting of the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Sooiety has voted in favour of amalgamation with the Manchester Unity of Bricldayers, the Operative Stonemasons&apos; Society and the Masons&apos; and Paviors&apos; Union.   On the 9th inst.
a meeting was held in London to discuss the amalgamation of all the unions connected with the vehicle building industry. It is proposed that they shall amalgamate into a national organisation to be known as the National Union of Vehicle Builders, with head-quarters in Birmingham.Trade Union Friction.It is reported that there is a prospect that the long-continued demarcation dispute between the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers will be settled on the basis probably of &quot; dual membership,&apos;-&apos; that is, mechanics working at collieries who are, for the most part, members of the A.S.E. although the M.F.G.B. has, especially within recent months, been making great efforts to secure their affiliation, will be allowed to hold the cards of both unions in. return for a single contribu-tion to the A.S.E. A dispute has arisen among Trade Unions in the printing industry as a result of the decision of the Scottish Typographical Association to organise a special section for workers in the trade who are at present unorganised. The National Printing and Kindred Trades Federation has objected to this decision on the ground that there are already unions in the industry for which all classes of workers are eligible.Co-operative Societies and Income Tax.There is much anxiety in the co-operative movement with regard to the proposal of the Royal Commission on Income Tax to tax the trading surplus of co-operative societies. A meeting took place at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 15th April, attended by 217 delegates representing the southern section of the Co-operative Union, which passed a resolution against the proposal. The Colne Co-operative Society has authorised the spending of  1,000 in a campaign against this proposal. Mr. Fred Bramley has made an appeal in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; for Trade Union support for the co-operative movement in this matter. He gives details of the assistance granted by the co-operative movement to Trade Unionism at the time of the railway strike, and maintains that Trade Unionists have a moral obligation to give support to the co-operative movement in its determina-tion to resist this attempt to cripple its development.Trade Union Topics.South Wales Miners&apos; Federation. A meeting of the Executive Council of this body took place at Cardiff on the 16th inst., and it was resolved to move at the annual conference of the M.F.G.B. that the Workmens Compensation Act be amended to secure an amount of compensation equal to pre-accident wages, a like equivalent in cases of light employ-ment and an increase of maximum compensation for fatal accidents from  300 to  600. The decontrol of the mining industry i,s also demanded.Colliery Officials&apos; Union of South Wales. At a meeting of this union held at Pontypridd on the 13th April, the General Secretary of the Federation of Colliery Officials&apos; Unions of Great Britain contended that all officials in or about a colliery, even the clerical staff, should be members of their union. He objected that while the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain accepted contributions from the colliery weighers, they deprived them of taking an active part in management. This disfranchisement was inconsistent with the principles of the Federation.Post Office Controlling Officers&apos; Association. A conference of this Association has decided not to affiliate with,the Labour Party. It has approved of the principle of equal pay for equal work as between the sexes.Welsh Federation of Clerks&apos; Guilds. In connection with this Federation the formation of the following guilds has been decided upon : The National Mining Clerical and Admin-istrative Workers&apos; Guild, the National Iron and Steel and Kindred Trades Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild, the National Brewing and Malting Clerical and Adminis-trative Workers&apos; Guild, the National Transport Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild, the National Engineering Clerical and Administrative Workers&apos; Guild, the National Local Government and Public Utility Services Guild, and the National Miscellaneous Trades Guild.Ex-Service Men.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Demonstration. A large demonstration of ex-Service men took place on the 18th April, organised by the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers. Parties of men from all parts of London and the provinces met on the Embankment and marched to Hyde Park.   The object of the demonstration was to
protest against the attitude of the Premier in regard to the ex-Service men&apos;s deputation to him on the 6th February, to call upon the Government to deal with the unemployment question and to cease the discharge of ex-Service men from Government factories and dock-yards, pending the adoption of suitable schemes for the absorption of men who have served their country, to ask for increased pensions, and to demand a public inquiry into the action of the police on the occasion of the demonstration of ex-Service men on the 1st March.Trade Unions and Ex-Service Mew.-Earl Haig&apos;s speech at Bristol on the 15th April, when he referred to the attitude of Trade Unions towards ex-Service men, has elicited a chorus of protests from Trade Union leaders. Mr. J. Kinniburgh, organiser of the Elec-trical Trades Union, has asserted that the Electrical Trades Union has assisted to carry out the Government request that 5 per cent, of the number of men engaged in any branch of the industry should be disabled soldiers. The Bristol District Secretary of the A.S.E. and the London District Secretary of the A.S.E. have also registered protests. The latter alleges that at a recent meeting of the National Federation of ex-Service Men (which Federation is meant is not indicated) it was unanimously agreed that the attitude adopted by the A.S.E. was by no means detrimental to the interests of ex-Service men. He adds that at the present time some 24,000 members of the A.S.E. are out of work, and that it is not fair and honest to place disabled men in a trade already overrun with competition.Industrial Demands and Disputes.Miners. A delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation decided to authorise the giving of fourteen days&apos; notice to strike in support of the men at Ynysddu colliery, Nine Mile Point, Monmouthshire, who have been idle since the 22nd March over a trivial minimum wage dispute concerning two men. It may be noted that the decision of the delegate conference to authorise the giving of strike notices was arrived at in opposition to the advice of the executive which was in favour of a resumption of work pending negotiations with regard to the matter at issue. The executive is now of opinion that the delegate conference^ decision will not receive the support of the rank and file, and that in a few days another delegate conference will authorise the withdrawal of the notices.Railwaymen.-The national demand for an increase in wages of  1 per week for members of the National Union of Railwaymen is welcomed by a large number of local branches. Other branches, however, criticise the demand as inadequate ; and there appears to be a growing agitation in favour of a minimum of  5 a week for all railwaymen. South Wales is not even satisfied with that; a conference of the rank and file of railway-men held as Port Talbot recently demanded a minimum of  6 a week for all railwaymen, the abolition of the sliding scale, and the revision of classification; and unless the executive committee complied with these demands by the 1st May it threatened to adopt a national &quot; work to rule &quot; movement. This policy has also been approved by a mass meeting in Manchester called by the Manchester District Council of the N.U.R.Cotton Operatives. A conference was held on the 16th April at Manchester between the executive of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations and the executive committees of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twisters, and of the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives. It ended, however, in a deadlock; the employers adhering to their previous declaration in favour of Government arbitration and the operatives declining to accept it. At separate con-ferences held at Manchester on the following day the two operatives&apos; amalgamations decided unanimously to ballot their members on the question of striking to enforce their demands.Court of Inquiry.The Court of Inquiry appointed under the Industrial Courts Act to investigate the hours of, labour of coal trimmers and tippers reassembled at Cardiff on the 12th and 13th April. Evidence was taken and the Court then adjourned until the 19th April, when it continued its sittings at. Montagu House.Unemployment Insurance Bill.A chorus of protests continues against the amendment recently carried in standing committee by which approved societies under the National Health Insurance Acts may administer the unemployment insurance scheme.   (See this Report for last week, p. 183.)Hours of Employment Bill.The Seafarers&apos; Joint Council has issued a memorandum on the exclusion of seafarers from this Bill.   The Council contravert the statement that it is impossible to make the Bill
applicable to seamen, and state that under present conditions the seafarer has to work 96 hours or more per week. They admit that the crews of ships or certain sections of the crews would have to be increased, but claim, that this would be discounted by the conversion of ships from steam to oil propulsion.Payment by Results.A special committee of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers discussed on the 15th April questions arising out of the resolution carried at a recent conference in favour of the principle of payment by results. A programme was drawn up which will be submitted to the employers. A number of resolutions of Trade Union branches against payment by results have been reported. Thus the Bristol branches of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have resolved to vote against payment by results until the workers have a full share of the administration of the industry, At a combined meeting of several Trade Union branches at Nottingham on the 11th April, a resolution was passed viewing with distrust the principle of payment by results as being inimical to the best interests of the worker.
