SUMMARY.RUSSIA.All the evidence received this month indicates that the Communist regime in Eussia is in desperate case and that it will not obtain peace a moment too soon. Labour conscription and the Industrial Army have undoubtedly been a disastrous failure. There appear to be no stocks of food available for export except in the Ukraine, where the peasantry will defend their stocks against the Bolsheviks to the last man; and even if stocks were available, there is no transportA parcel of some  3,000 worth of forged Bank of England  5 notes has been brought to this office. The forgeries are good, but the paper would probably not deceive an expert eye. There is information showing that the forgeries are carried out by Bolshevik officials.   The notes have been handed to the Bank of England.PRANCE.The Con/Miration Gdndrale du Travail is reported to have com-pleted a scheme for a revolution as soon as an opportunity occurs; it intends to organize a twenty-four hours&apos; strike and a big demonstration on May Day, always a critical date in France. The French authorities are taking what they believe to be effective precautions.BELGIUM.The real extremists are in a .minority and the Socialist Party has declared for adherence to the Second International.ITALY.There is much industrial unrest, but a general revolutionary movement is not to be expected immediately. The- Italian Govern-ment appears to intend to send a special Parliamentary Commission to Soviet Kussia, ostensibly to report on economic conditions but really to pave the way for peace negotiations.SPAIN.Spain appears to be playing an increasingly important part in the Bolshevik world-movement.PORTUGAL.The industrial unrest in Portugal is apparently not due to Bolshevism, and there is no trace of the activities of Eussian agents.GERMANY.The Government appears to be expecting another Monarchist coup d&apos; tat, and it is believed to have evidence that the Monarchists had a definite plan to encourage a Spartacist outbreak and then to come forward during the chaos that ensued as the saviours of the Fatherland. The Monarchists are never tired of pointing to weak-ness of the existing Government.Shortage of food will be more acutely felt during the present month than at any time during the year.[2893] B 2
SWITZERLAND.There has been a slight increase in Bolshevik propaganda.AUSTRIA AND HUNGARY.The Reactionaries in Austria and Hungary watched Germany very closely during the &quot; Kapp Putsch,&quot; and there were symptoms of a movement in co-operation with the German Monarchists.FINLAND.The situation is unstable; much depends upon what happens to the Reactionaries injGermany.BALTIC STATES.The Communists have begun to interfere in the internal affairs of Esthonia. The Latvian Peace Delegation has arrived in Moscow rather before it was expected, the fact being that the army could no longer be relied upon.It is reported that Germany and Lithuania have concluded an agreement for co-operation against Poland.GREECE.The Greek authorities profess to have discovered another plot to murder M. Venizelos at San Remo. Persons alleged to be implicated are to be arrested.CENTRAL ASIA.With the closing down of the Central Moslem Bureau in Moscow there will be a decrease of Bolshevik-Islamic propaganda in the East.With1 the resumption of peace and economic relations with Russia the Communist experiment, which at one time threatened Western Europe, will probably pass into history, and if it were not for the shortage of food and raw materials in Central Europe it would be still further discredited. The tendency of the Russian Communists is to sacrifice one after another of their original principles.
CONFIDENTIAL.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES.France..The French are suffering acutely from that pessimism and inability to settle down to work in which we ourselves have to a lesser extent shared; to which it must be added that France is demoralised: the victory over Germany has brought her nothing, while the increase in taxation and the cost of living can almost be noted day by day.C.G.T. and the Government.Such a state of mind is the extremists&apos; opportunity.  Things are now working up to an acute crisis between the Confederation Generate du Travail and the Government.  Towards the end of March the O.G.T. decided to send a delegation to the Government to announce that if effective steps to reduce the cost of living were not taken a forty-eight hours&apos; general strike would be declared throughout France. This ultimatum was preceded by a series of mass meetings organised everywhere by the C.G.T. to protest against la vie cJUre; at these meetings moderate and extreme Socialists met in perfect agreement for the first time since the wave of resolve in 1914 when war broke out.   Under the same auspices the Union des Syndicats de la Seine is conducting a strong campaign of Bolshevik propaganda.  At the Paris meeting Raymond Pericat expressed sympathy with the Sinn Feiners and said that the Irish Revolution would be accomplished within two months and that revolution in France would follow hard upon it.All Labour meetings in France lately have been specially directed to recommending the theory of advanced Socialism. The Government is reported as unlikely to be able to withstand a revolutionary outbreak; only the inhabitants of the rural districts and an uncertain proportion of the Army are untainted with the new doctrine.The C.G.T. is now making arrangements to control the revolution when it comes; M. Jouhaux, the Secretary, has said that the intellectual elements in the Socialist Party support it and that the C.G.T. will take control of the movement. He says they do not desire to go so far as the Bolsheviks, but that the dismissal of M. Deschanel and his reactionary Government must come. Extremists generally are greatly concerned by the line taken by the C.G.T.;
they wish to see the movement originate in the name of International Socialism and not of the Trade Unions, but the organized workers of France have as a rule no love for Bolshevism and would not allow it any part in the new administration.Revolutionary meetings are being held daily at which C.G.T. officials advocate revolution. Decisive action will probably be taken on the 1st of May plans having been laid for a blockade of Paris on that date by the suspension of train, postal, and telegraph services. At a meeting of the C.G.T. on the 31st of March a large majority decided to organize for the 1st of May a general strike of twenty-four hours in concert with an international syndicate in favour of the socialization of the means of production and of exchange; the French Seamens Federation decided on a like course; and the National Council of the Miners&apos; Federation decided that, unless the Govern-ment satisfied the demands of the miners before the 25th of April, a general strike of all underground workers would be proclaimed. The C.G.T. is reported to stake all on this attempt-its own future and the lives of its members.The attitude of the partisans of M. Caillaux is still obscure. Many of his followers are definitely Extremist in tendency; M. Caillaux himself still holds a very high post as a Freemason (Grand Orient) and has a great following among the Freemasons, of whom Jouhaux is one; many industrial leaders are reported to await Caillaux&apos;s order to support a revolutionary movement on his behalf. A great sensation has been caused by the public declaration of Bidegaray, Secretary of the Railway Workers&apos; Federation, at a large meeting, that he would appeal for a railway strike on the occasion of the revolution to impose the dictatorship of the proletariat. Bidegaray is also a Freemason.The Socialist Party and the &quot; Hybrid &quot; International.According to the Secretary of the French Socialist Party, steps are to be taken forthwith towards the reconstruction of the new International, which is to have a programme midway between those of the Second and Third Internationals. Representatives of the French Socialist Party will be despatched to Russia, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, while Longuet is to come to London for a Conference with the Independent Labour Party and other parties.At a meeting held on the 15th of March dissident French Socialists decided to form a new French Socialist Party distinct from the Unified Socialist Party. This party will take a broader line of action, coalition with other parties in the Chamber being permitted where expedient. Closest to the new party come M. RenaudeFs Minority Socialists, who still adhere to the Unified Socialist Party.Extremist and other Groups.The Association lUpullicainc des Anciens Gombattants held an important meeting on the 21st of March; 10,000 ex-soldiers with red banners inscribed &quot;War upon War,&quot; &quot;Long Live the Soviets,&quot; &amp;c, paraded past Raymond Lefebvre, Tournay, Yaillant-Couturier, Marcel Cachin and others; Foch and Poincare&apos; were scandalously abused. Posters appeared  in  Paris countersigned by Henri Barbusse,
declaring that if the Government prosecuted nr in any way interfered with a member of the A.R.A.C. that body would at once call upon the standing army of the country for a revolution. Police action has been authorized by the French Director of Public Prosecutions. Any conflicts are bound to be most serious, for the A.R.A.C. are trained soldiers and will not hesitate to use extreme violence.The Groupe Claris has decided to send two delegates to the Ex-Soldiers&apos; International Congress at Geneva in May, at which delegates will meet from every belligerent country and will include Clartd representatives from England, France, America, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Austria and Russia.M. Keren sky has begun a series of lectures on the Russian Revolution, under the auspices of the Ligue Soviet, a Russian organization.   Eclouard Minor, the revolutionary, presided. A Bolshevik Bureau is said to have been opened at Brest. The Confederation of Intellectual Workers in France is now an accomplished fact; 200 delegates, representing all forms of intellectual labour, met at Paris on the 19th of March.  The Federa-tion aims at creating an ensemble of intellectual values, and announces its friendship for labour and that it will take no part in party strife. Note. It is regretted that owing to an unavoidable delay the information concerning the Paris railway strike&apos; and the Slrasburg Socialist Conference arrived too late to make the issue of the Special Report referred to in our last number of any practical value.Belgium.Socialists and Extremists.At a Congress of the Belgian Socialist Party at Brussels on the 5th of April a resolution to adhere to the Second International was passed by a large majority. The Secretary of the Party opposes affiliation with the Third International or with the &quot; Reconstruction &quot; International in process of formation by the Swiss Socialist Party, Longuefs Party in France, the German Independents and the British Independent Labour Party. The Socialist, Camille Huysmans, who is the one outstanding Labour leader, has since his election as Socialist Deputy for Antwerp last November, become more moderate in his views. He upholds constitutional methods and is reported now to be opposed to the policy of direct action. Indeed, Bolshevist principles, though they have recently found advocates among the Flemish Socialist newspapers, make no general appeal to the working classes.The F6d6ration des Jeunes Gardes Socialistes de Belgiqve met at Brussels on the 14th of March. The tone of the Conference was moderate, most members being opposed to the extreme revolutionary policy of Jacquemotte and the Brussels branch, who have been openly advocating revolution on the Russian model. The Brussels delegates were called upon to explain their withdrawal from the Executive of the Parti Ouvrier. Participation in the Congress was finally denied them. The recent miners&apos; strikes are, however, attributed to the propaganda of the Jeunes Gardes Socialistes and were not sanctioned by the Miners&apos; Union.
On the 1st of March a revolutionary paper called VOuvrier Comvmniste appeared at Brussels with a leading article attacking English Imperialism. This paper is intended to replace a former revolutionary paper called Socialisme, which ceased publication on the threat of legal proceedings by the Government. The editor is Van Overstraeten, the Belgian delegate to the Third International Conference at Amsterdam, who was then arrested and deported by the Dutch. The Belgian Authorities are now enquiring into the source of the funds of this newspaper. Van Ojverstraeten&apos;s house was searched but nothing incriminating was found.A certain Basil Ghelgounoff at Brussels pretends he has been deputed to watch over the interests of Eussian prisoners in Belgium and expects to receive 4,000,000 kronen from his Government through Holland. His residence was raided by the police on the 12th of March.iLabour Situation.An increase in the cost of living has had an adverse effect on the situation. At Antwerp the influx of visitors for the Olympic games raised it still further with distinctly disquieting results. The general labour situation is, however, slightly improved.The campaign for State control of the sale of coal is being continued by the Trade Unions. The National Miners&apos; Congress discussed it at Brussels and recommended that a beginning should be made by nationalizing the new coal deposits in Limberg and south of the Hainault districts.The threatened general strike of miners was averted by the granting of 15 per cent, increase on wages, which makes necessary a rise in the price of coal. The strike of textile workers in Northern France affected some 15,000 Belgian^workmen.It was hoped that the strike of transport workers at Eotterdam would bring increased -trade to Antwerp. Shipping certainly multi-plied, but without benefit, since Antwerp transport workers ordered their members to handle, no &quot; tainted &quot; goods from Eotterdam or merchandize diverted to Antwerp owing to the strike.Mr. Havelock Wilson&apos;s statement that the Dutch strikers had the sympathy of his Union is said to have influenced the Antwerp Union of Dock Workers in giving this order. The agitation among the dock workers has, however, been somewhat allayed by the decision of the Fdddration Maritime to increase their minimum wage to 20 francs a day, although the Dock Workers&apos; Union still refuses to allow Rotterdam goods to be handled.Strikes in other industries are continually occurring, but none have assumed first-class importance.Foreign Relations.French influence is reported to be increasing, notably at Antwerp, where the idea is gaining ground that France is the only country to be depended on because she is in sympathy with Belgium and because the two countries have in common the alleged ignominy of being flouted by England in the Peace negotiations.
, The unfortunate prevalence of this sentiment is ascribed to the usual absence of British propaganda. Certain Belgian newspapers, notably the Nation Beige, regularly disseminate French opinion on International matters and keep in continual touch with Paris through their correspondents, but of the British point of view there is no presentation and the verdict goes against us by default.Public interest in the Belgian-Dutch Frontier Treaty has waned owing to increasing public concern with French policy in Luxemburg. An economic alliance between France, Luxemburg and Belgium was described by M. Emile Prum, ex-leader of the Catholic Party in the Luxemburg House of Representatives, as disastrous to Belgian interests and as likely eventually to result in the complete absorption of the country by its southern neighbour.Italy.Political.Signor Nitti has reconstructed his Cabinet. The new Ministry, in which neither Catholics nor Socialists are represented, includes representatives from Signor Luzzati on the Right to Signor Bonomi, the Reformist Socialist, on the Left. The Socialists in the House number 150 and the Catholics 100. These two groups are with-holding their support from the Government for an identical reason, namely that they are both convinced that past mistakes are irremediable and that a now policy of wide social, reform is necessary.Though the figures leave the Government without a working majority it is said that the Catholics are, at least temporarily, inclined to give the Government a fair trial. &apos; None of the conflicting parties really desires the responsibility of office, though Signor Giolitti&apos;s name has been put forward for the Premiership.Meanwhile the Government is said to be acting with the tolerance which befits its position. Commendatore Emilio Saraceni, Chief of the Naples Police, puts down the disturbances, which have been frequent, to the lack of authority shown, and says he has received orders to tolerate everything in order not to exasperate popular feeling. The Governments instability is enhanced by the difficulties it has inherited. The previous Government completely failed to deal with the shortage of food; disorganization and confusion pre-prevailed; speculation was unchecked, and Government losses were enormous. Government control only aggravated the trouble, which led to dangerous popular indignation, for which the hitherto un-attained improvement of distribution is said to be the one remedy.At Trieste and- in the Trentino the prevailing misery was laid at the door of the Italian Government, which the workmen compare unfavourably with the former Austrian regime.Relations with the Soviet Government.The Italian Government favours the resumption of trade with Soviet Russia, and is prepared to give all facilities to Italian commercial and industrial firms and to representatives of the Co-operative Societies who may wish to visit Italy. It is sending a Parliamentary Inter-Party Mission to investigate conditions in Russia.
Serrati, the editor of the Avanti, is to be a member of this Mission The Soviet Government are preparing to welcome him with open arms. Two Italian deputies named Bombacci and Cabrini have reached Copenhagen to negotiate with LitvinofT.The Socialist Party.The Executive Committee of the Socialist Party has decreed that Socialist representatives must oppose the Government in every way possible and attempt to weaken Parliament, if necessary by obstruction and violence. As the Socialists believe that a revolution is inevitable they are making no effort to hasten its arrival, but are preparing to seize political and economic control when the Govern-inent falls. They are described as directing their efforts towards something in the nature of a Soviet Government. A draft scheme is stated to have been drawn up for Soviets or Workmen&apos;s Councils and in some instances Workmen^ Committees have been formed which have actually taken over the working of factories.The Socialist Party is encouraging the foundation of a Federation of Intellectual Labour to unite all existing associations among the professional classes, State and Municipal employees, and non-manual workers. This Federation is ostensibly non-political, but represents an economic social movement intended to &quot; integrate with, and not to serve as an antithesis to, that of the working classes.&quot; The bourgeoisie, though uneasy at the Socialists&apos; revolutionary methods, may accept this Federation as their weapon against Government ineptitude.In opposition to the Socialists the Anarchists, heedless of conse-quences, are striving to bring about a revolutionary outburst and grasping every opportunity to provoke labour unrest and economic disturbances. The scarcity of raw material makes for general discontent in that the number of unemployed still increases. The only remedy which the Government apparently has to offer is emigration.there are indications that the Bolsheviks intend to use the Italian Socialist Party to obtain the release of Hungarian Communists now interned in Austria and their transfer to Soviet Russia.Bombacci, the Italian Socialist, has stated that should a Govern-ment of his Party come into power, the Austrian Tyrol will be given national autonomy.Strikes.There is no direct evidence to show that a general strike is being prepared to reduce the cost of living, but signs are not wanting that this weapon will be employed should the Government insist on introducing the rationing system.In anticipation of a general strike against the cost of living and the Government rationing system, special detachments of troops are being organized for police duty. It is hoped to organize the police corps known as the Begia Guardia into a force which, in addition to its functions as police, will be able to supply men to run the public services in case of need as well as to police ports and perform other duties. This Begia Guardia is essentially a military force, but is under the Home Office. It now numbers 15,000, but after the completion of demobilization will, it is estimated, be increased to 200,000.
Meanwhile Socialist agitation continues among the railwaymen and post office employees despite the concessions recently obtained. It has resulted in sporadic outbursts and disorder in the workshops, strikes amongst agricultural labourers and conflicts with the police and the military. The slightest pretext is seized upon for creating a dis-turbance or refusing to work. The movement for a general strike in May or June, which is being controlled by the Italian Socialist Tarty, is said to have gained the support of the French, of the Spanish, and of some of the English comrades. The latter are reported to be divided with regard to it.In Milan a scheme propounded to allow employees a share in the profits and control of factories is being studied by the Workmen&apos;s Councils.Crime is on the increase in Italy, especially in the North, where it has recently assumed the character of brigandage. The criminals are said to be bands of demobilised soldiers either unwilling or unable to find work. Police measures are described as inadequate and inefficient.The Roman police have been watching, hitherto without result, Egyptian Nationalists and Irish Sinn Feiners now in Italy, who are expected to be in communication with d&apos;Annunzio. D&apos;Annuuzio is also reported to have been in touch wiih the Bolshevik leaders.Spain.Spain appears to be playing an increasingly important part in the Bolshevik world movement. A report has been received that the Spanish Bolsheviks are receiving correspondence from extremists in England, hinting at a great Communist meeting to be held this Spring. In order to prevent the entry of Bolshevik agents, the Spanish authorities have forbidden ships&apos; crews entering Spanish ports to land, except under the guarantee of the ship&apos;s captain, who must give an undertaking that he will not leave any of them behind.Conditions in the country, especially as regards land tenure, are described as only comparable with those in France before the Revolution. The land is owned by rich absentees who never go near their properties, but leave it to agents to extract the utmost profit without expenditure on improvements. Wages until recently were scandalously low and prepared the soil for the Syndicalist-Bolshevist doctrine, which, duly sown, sprang up and increased throughout the country. One result of this is an accentuation of the evils of absenteeism, landowners, as in Andalusia, regarding the prospect as so black :.hat they are allowing their land to lie fallow rather than risk destruction of their crops when the agitation begins. In Andalusia the unrest is fomented from Barcelona and is increasing, while German influence is making headway. The agricultural unrest is expected to come to a head in the summer.Conditions in Barcelona are still far from satisfactory and more serions trouble is expected soon. The Patronos appear to be carrying out their promises fairly and wages have been raised all round, but the Syndicates are regaining their predominance and resorting more and more to terrorism and outrages. They have reformed their organization, having found that it was completely known to the authorities.  They are now spreading their propaganda
further afield, especially in small country towns, which are already badly affected. In Barcelona itself their meetings have been pro-hibited. Meanwhile the Governor has stopped all gambling in the town so that he may have time to make a definite ruling on what has long been a serious scandal.A recrudescence of industrial unrest and Syndicalist activity is reported in the Asturias coalfield in the Oviedo district, in Saragosa, and at Seville and Santiago. At Santiago martial law was proclaimed and political motives were held to underlie the agitation. This strike came to an end on the 9th of March and martial law was raised.All parties apparently agreed to keep the present Government in power until the crucial questions of the railway tariff and the budget were settled, but a change of Government is expected as soon as the King has sanctioned the law. It is expected that Dato will then form a ministry of a coalition of the Conservative groups.With regard to the railway tariffs it is probable that the party in favour of raising them will succeed in obtaining an increase of from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent. Carnbo, the best-informed man on rail-way matters in Parliament, while advocating an increase in freights, so that the Government may take over the railways as a paying concern, is in favour of nationalisation and subsequent redemption by the State.The Congress of the Railwaymen&apos;s Federation at Madrid voted for the nationalisation of the railways with a view to their exploita-tion by the Railwaymen&apos;s Labour Organization. Finally on the 23rd of March a strike broke out on all the Spanish lines, except those in Andalusia. It was settled the following day by the Government authorising a loan to the Railway Companies sufficient to raise wages for a month, pending a decision on the Tariffs Bill now before Parliament.Frederick Wertheimer, German Consul at Algeciras, returned from Germany in February, bringing funds to be used to foment a general strike in Gibraltar in the spring.Portugal.In the political crisis which took place in the middle oi March, Maria Antonio da Silva, the head of the Republican Guard, resigned after holding office for twenty-four hours, partly because he thought it politic to remain in the background for a time and partly because of the rumoured protests against his appointment of Dr. Julio Martins, an extremist, to the portfolio of war. By persisting with this appointment he would have created trouble between the Army and the Republican Guard, a condition of affairs for which he was not prepared, despite the reported prevalence of syndicalism among certain regiments in the Army.Before his resignation da Silva considered that only a dictator could deal with the present situation, a view adopted by the new Prime Minister, Batista, who succeeded in getting Parliament to dissolve in order to give him a free hand.Industrial unrest in Portugal is apparently not due to Bolshevism proper, and there is no evidence of support from Russia or elsewhere by active agents.
The Bolshevik paper Batcdha was doing its utmost to promote a revolution, but was unable to carry on its printing when the electricians came out, until light and power were restored to it by the representatives of law and order. This newspaper is said to be in straits for funds.Political chaos generally may be due to party strife, while the industrial unrest is stirred up by high prices and the recent rapid fall in the exchange.Collisions between strikers and troops have been few. When the new Government came in there was a disposition to give it a chance to redress grievances, especially in the North, where the extravagance of rich people in Oporto has caused demonstrations. Much indeed depends on the new Governments ability to repress and punish profiteering, to tax war fortunes and to revise recent legislation regarding exchange and imports.The general strike of Government employees was brought to an end by an increased war bonus.The Government proceeded at once to deal with the enhanced cost of living and has imposed legislation, which the dissolution of Parliament till the middle of April gave it a free hand to do, regarding standard bread for all, the punishment and fining of profiteers, the punishment of offences against the public and the lowering of the cost of living.The Extremists were of course disappointed by the failure of the general strike and endeavoured to raise disturbances, but popular sympathy is on the whole with the Government rather than with the strikers.A widespread revolutionary plot aiming at a general upheaval having come to light, the Government declared itself firmly determined to maintain order.The proposed Industrial Workers of the World Conference at Lisbon did not take place, the authorities having been warned and having taken the necessary measures.The large emigration of better-class Portuguese to the United States is regrettable as the reconstruction of the country largely depends upon people of that class.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. Norway.The declared aim of the Extreme Left Socialist Party is to establish a Norwegian Soviet Republic during the summer of 1920, with the aid of existing funds and special subsidies from Moscow and by means of the usual paraphernalia of strikes, disorganised commu-nications and terroristic propaganda.The Norwegian Labour Party and Syndicalists&apos; Federation are both receiving funds from Moscow and Stockholm and are working in close touch with the Western Bureau of the Third International at Amsterdam, under whose influence they, are establishing Communist groups in all branches of industry and in all State services. Revolu-tionary spies are reported to be kept in Government offices so as to inform Communist Headquarters of Government counter-measures,.
Rumours of revolutionary movements in the United Kingdom are circulated.Violent revolution seems improbable, however. For one thing labour conscription in Soviet Russia is acting as a very strong deterrent. Again, the prohibition of the sale of arms has been so carefully and successfully enforced in Norway that the revolu-tionaries themselves admit that they are very scantily provided with weapons or ammunition.The police are doing their utmost to get rid of the foreign agitators. These have for long been disturbing Norwegian labour and influencing the Norwegian workman, who is too prone to take at its face value anything that comes from a gentleman who has seen the world. Extremist propaganda is reported as particularly active among farm hands in the Trondlijem and Larvik districts.On the whole the desire seems to lie for gradual but fundamental social reform and it is surmised that splits among the Socialist Parties and Groups may ultimately lead to the formation of a national moderate party which will make a good Parliamentary opposition.The increasing influence of the constitutional socialists renders the success of the threatened April strikes uncertain. On the other hand it is still possible that the extremists, realising that they are losing power, will renew their efforts and endeavour to force an issue.At a Congress of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation, attended by delegates from England, France, Germany, Norway and Holland, which opened at Christiania on the 5th of February, the admission of the representative of the Transport Workers&apos; Group of the Industrial Workers of the World was discussed and finally agreed to.   The programme of the Federation was stated to be as follows: 1. To establish a powerful International organization. 2. To work for the social and economic benefit of the transport workers.3. To tight exploitation of labour and defend the solidarity of the labouring classes by national or international action.It was decided that the organization of one country could apply directly for support to that of another country but must at the same time report to the Central Committee. Mr. Robert Williams, the British representative, urged very strongly che importance of inter-national solidarity. Outside the Conference he was loud in his declaration that the British proletariat now works for direct action and that the fall of the bourgeois regime in England is imminent. Among other subjects discussed in camera were the attitude of the Congress towards the German Communist revolution and the Third International, the action which British Transport Workers would take to stop traffic detrimental to Soviet Russia, the question whether in case of a Western Revolution any action could be taken and which organizations were reliable and to what extent.The Conference ended with the inevitable resolution in favour of Soviet Russia and the equally inevitable bicker with the German delegates,who were accused by Mr. Robert Williams of claiming more votes than they should. The Germans swore that their membership had increased from 192,000 to 350,000 since 1919.
15121Sweden.On his assumption of office as Sweden&apos;s first Socialist Prime Minister, M. Branting said that he would continue transforming the present social structure in a democratic spirit, since its programme was necessarily limited by the actual political situation of the country, popular representation not yet being in accord with socialistic views to such a degree that a Socialist Government comes as a matter of course. Among the Swedish workmen there is little comment on the change of Government, and in spite of detrimental articles in the Politihn, Branting appears to be greatly trusted. Left Socialists are in vain holding up to the workmen recent events in Germany as a proof that the Right Socialists are incapable of governing the country.Although the lock-out has come to an end, further disturbances may shortly be expected in the building trade. Other unions are tired of industrial disturbances and are not likely to afford this movement much support. With&apos; the end of the lock-out the eagerness on the part of the workmen to go to Soviet Russia has cooled down, and though 7,000 were said to have decided to go there, it is improbable chat more than 10 per cent, of that number will actually leave Sweden. A report from Moscow states that the Petrograd workers collected 10,000,000 roubles for the SwedishThe Bolshevik Central Committee in Stockholm, which is directed by Frederick Strom, received a communication in March from the &quot; Comradi-s &quot; in London urging increased agitation for peace between England and Soviet Russia. A regular courier system is stated to exist between Reval and Moscow, all communications passing through the hands of Strom at Stockholm. Strom has recently asked for further propaganda money.j Political.Owing to the failure of the Radical Government under M. Zahle to obtain a majority in the Chamber on the question of the acceptance of the results of the plebiscite in the Second Schleswig zone, the King dismissed the Ministry on the 29th of March and called on M. Otto Liebe to form a new Government. As a protest against the King&apos;s action a general strike was declared, but later called off, a settlement being arrived at, after prolonged negotiations, but before the date fixed for the strike to take place. A certain amount of rioting occurred at the instance of Syndicalists, but the police were able to restore order.New elections are to be held on the 22nd of April, and meanwhile a non-political Cabinet of Officials and fresh Liberal blood has been formed under the direction of M. Friis, with the mission of convoking the Rigsdag, pushing through the Electoral Bill, and holding theIelections. It seems not improbable that the Radicals will lose heavily in these. The attitude of their Press in helping to initiate a general strike and the fact that their members in the Town Council headed a procession of Syndicalists with red flags, in the company of riff-raff from the suburbs, are said to have weakened their positionstrikers.Denmark.
considerably. The Socialists are also likely to lose. Large numbers of the lower middle classes, who voted for the party last time, are enraged by the prospect of a general strike and the Socialists&apos; co-operation with the Syndicalists.The prospects of the Conservatives are even more dubious, and the outcome of the whole incident is a complete defeat of Conservative policy in Denmark, and also an impairment of Conservative prestige which may prove to be permanent. The Liberals are now likely to sweep the country with the cry that the peasantry are not to be terrorised by labour in Copenhagen and other towns.Extremists.The first Congress of the New Independent Socialist Party in Denmark took place recently at Odense. The Party has been joined by the Danish Communists, a number of Syndicalists and the Social Democratic Young People&apos;s Party. The Communists of the First Schleswig Zone also joined the Party and were welcomed as the link between German and Danisli Communists. Attempts of the German and Swiss Independent Socialists, the latter headed by Frederick Strom, to attend the Conference, were frustrated by the Danish police.The Danish Left Socialists are reported to have ceased their propaganda for the time being in order not to compromise Litvinoff, with whom they are in close touch. As soon as he leaves, however, their propaganda will begin again, and the Syndicalist Christensen, recently released from prison, will probably take an active part.George Lansbury&apos;s description of Russia as an earthly paradise has made a deep impression on Independent Socialists in Denmark, many of whom have subscribed to the Daily Herald in consequence. German Communist papers, which published good translations of Lansbury&apos;s telegrams, were purchased by those who did not read English.The greater part of the considerable Russian colony at present at Copenhagen, although by instinct anti-Bolshevik, is refraining from political activity. For the most part refugees from Soviet Russia, they are largely engaged in profitable business in Copenhagen. At heart they are pro-German rather than anything else and they are said to be trying to link up with similar Russian groups in Berlin. A secret organization in Denmark consisting of members of all classes, whose object is to mediate between masters and men, is reported. It is said to be backed by the Employers&apos; Association. The Society will endeavour to alleviate the effect of strikes or lock-outs in vital industries by the supply of volunteer workers.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.Holland.Effect of the German Revolution.The effect of the Kapp Putsch with its contre-coup in Germany led at once to a stiffening of the attitude of the Dutch Authorities and a recrudescence of revolutionary propaganda, especially among the
striking Transport Workers. The announcement that, should any outbreak occur, the Dutch Police would not hesitate to use their arms, had a sedative effect on Wynkoop and his friends, who agreed with the Authorities on one point at least, viz., that the reactionary attitude of the East Netherlands disposed of the danger that the G-erman  evolution might spread to Holland.Transport Workers Strike.The Transport Workers&apos; strike, which has been prolonged in Holland since February, is of historic importance in that it is the first which can pretend to Internationalism, both as regards co-opera-tion between sections of workers in different countries and as regards the International derivation of the funds to maintain it.The Dutch Unions, it is true, are financially in very low water, paying, as they must, a weekly 50,000 guilders to the strikers. From time to time,&apos;however, they have received subsidies of 20,000 guilders from Rutgers of the Third International Bureau at Amsterdam, money eventually traceable to Russia, while early in March the Transport Workers&apos; Federation in England sent  1,000 to keep the strike going.To prevent the collapse of the Dutch dockers&apos; strike from want of funds, the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions early in March levied 50 centimes per week on all affiliated Union members. Wynkoop&apos;s statement that the Communist Party contribution was only 2,000 florins was probably made to cover the real amount given.Belgian transport workers and dock labourers refused to load or unload any Dutch ships diverted to Belgium.One split has occurred between the strikers and one has been threatened; the first was between the Central Union and the Extreme Union on the question of handling fats for Amsterdam; the second was on the question of spreading the strike to other vital industries, to which the Central Union has been averse. S. J. Van den Berg is the extreme protagonist of extension, while R. Williams condemns the principle of confining the strike to Rotterdam and Amsterdam and urges that the workers in all Dutch ports should be called out.Meanwhile the Federation of the Employers has agreed that none of its members shall resume work independently; any employer failing to comply with this agreement is to be fined 5,000 guilders.The Second International Conference.The preliminary Conference of the Second International began rather weakly at Rotterdam on the 23rd of March. It decided to send a mission of investigation to Poland, the Ukraine and Soviet Russia. Huysmans stated that the Pole-Zion Party in Berlin had placed  150.000 at the disposal of the Nationalists to defray the expenses of this mission. Those for Poland and the Ukraine were to leave Berlin on the 10th of April, and that to Soviet Russia as soon as passports for Finland could be obtained.The Conference brought some grist to the mill of the Dutch police, who, since the meeting  of the Third International in February, have evidently been on the alert.  They learnt that one [2893] * C
Anguiano, a secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party and a Spanish delegate to the meeting, was the bearer of a closed letter from a Spanish Socialist to the Dutch Communist leader Wynkoop. Anguiano was arrested and searched, a letter written a fortnight before by Wynkoop to the Secretary of the Union QinSmle de Travailleurs of Spain, M. Largo Caballero, was found on him. It directed Anguiano to visit Wynkoop immediately he arrived in Holland, before getting in touch with &quot; those traitors of the Second International.&quot;Anguiano, it was later learnt, was to obtain funds from Wynkoop for Bolshevik propaganda in Spain. The letter found on him was sent by an individual named Ramirez who styles himself &quot; Commis-sioner of the People for Estramadura of the future Bolshevik Government in Spain.&quot; Ramirez asked Lenin through Wynkoop to send funds for Bolshevik propaganda, whose first aim would be revolution in Barcelona. Ramirez further stated that both Anguiano and Wynkoop must side track and distrust Besteiro, the other Spanish delegate to the meeting, because he was a Majority Socialist.The Spanish Minister at The Hague pressed for the release of Anguiano, who was accordingly allowed to go from the concentration camp to Rotterdam where he was confined to the Hotel de Prance and not allowed to leave except under the supervision of the Spanish Consul.Anguiano gave an account of the letters he was carrying. Ramirez who signed them is by that account a Mexican who arrived in Madrid some months ago with a Russian named Balodin, soi-disant delegate of the Executive Committee of the Third International in South America and Spain. Balodin gathered a group of Young Socialists about him in Madrid and has recently asked Wynkoop for funds, which, however, they have hitherto not received. Balodin is now said to be in Germany. Before going there, he wrote from Amsterdam, where he visited Wynkoop, that he would soon be sending a sum of money.The leader of the Young Socialists in Madrid is Ugarte, a son of an advocate there. The group aims at creating divisions in the Spanish Socialist Party and founding a regular Communist Party.The Third International Bureau.The Third International Bureau recently founded at Amsterdam is charged with spreading Communist ideas among the workmen of Western Europe and- America. A bulletin in Erench, English and German is to be distributed twice monthly, and will contain accounts of the progress of the Communist movement in Western Europe and America. Close touch is to be maintained with the Secretariat for Western Europe which is to be set up in England, and this Secretariat is reported to have been temporarily charged with the publication of the Moscow monthly organ of the Third International, L&apos;Internationale Communiste. The Western Bureau of the Third International in Holland has not yet been made permanent, probably because of the ill-will to it by the bureau in Germany, directed by a certain James Reich. For the time being, however, both are to continue on as good a mutual footing as may be, until a further
International Communist Conference in three months&apos; time decides between them.The Dutch Bureau of the Third, International has recently opened a section to combat counter-revolutionary activities in Western Europe. It will employ agents to find out about counter-Bolshevik organizations and the individuals connected with them.It is reported from Copenhagen that a Russian named Glewisch is on his way to The Hague via Hungary and Austria with 40 million Czar roubles for propaganda.Wynkoop denies that he received money or jewels from Russia, with what veracity may be determined by the fact of the arrest of Henrik Karelfelt, a jeweller at Stockholm and notorious Bolshevist, who visited Wynkoop shortly after his arrival in Holland, bringing with him a large quantity of diamonds which lie advertised for sale in the Handelsblad.A parallel movement of propaganda among the wives of workmen to that proposed by Sylvia Pankhurst in England, is indicated by a meeting recently held in Rotterdam by wives of men belonging to the extreme Federation of Transport Workers. At this meeting violent attacks were made on .capitalisin and those present were urged to refrain from breaking the strike. The spreading of propaganda among the women appears to be contemplated by the Bolsheviks in Holland.Germany. 1. The Kapp-Liittwitz Revolt.An article by Karl Radek, which appeared in the Izvestia just before the outbreak of the &quot; Kappiade,&quot; shows the presumptive accuracy of that astute gentleman&apos;s appreciation of the situation in Germany as embodied in his report to the Soviet Government (vide March report: Germany). The gist of the article is that the Allies by their demand for the surrender under the Peace Treaty of Ludendorff, Tirpitz, the Crown Prince and 900 officers, and by their encouragement of national repression by the French and the Poles, were working for a military coup d&apos;state in Germany which would inevitably result in a workers&apos; revolution. Foresight so exactly followed by events lends authority to Radek&apos;s depiction of the close relations between the Soviet Government and the German militarists. and great industrials, of whom one of the greatest, Hugo Stinnes, the supporter of Bermondt, is, significantly enough, now trying to corner the main German war industries.Meanwhile scraps of evidence are accumulating to show the connivance of Noske and the Ebert Government as a whole with the Reactionaries. Crispien, the German Independent Socialist, averred to a Swiss pressman that the Ebert Government was so implicated, and that a Government courier went to Amerongen in December and returned with instructions from the Ex-Emperor to his late generals and officials. He added that a Dutch agent in the pay of the German Foreign Office still made regular three weekly journeys to Amerongen under commercial cover. The substitution by order of the Queen of Holland of an anti-German Burgermaster at Amerongen for one who was known to have German leanings may have significance in this connection.[2893] C 2
The egregious Trebitsch Lincoln says that the ex-Emperor is insane, and tried to sell an article to this effect to the London representative of a prominent New York paper. The article was declined. It is said to have looked like an attempt to pave the way for the reinstatement of the Crown Prince.The effect of the revolt has been to direct the fury of the German workman not so much against the Reactionaries, with whom he has in common, at any rate, the smarting sense of defeat, as against the Majority Socialists, whom he considers to have betrayed him. The weapon of the general strike has turned in the hand of the Majority Socialists. The Red revolt consequent upon it has driven the Government, willingly or unwillingly, into something very like a compact with the Monarchists, upon whom it has been obliged to rely in its restoration of the Ruhr district. This in its turn, following upon the long series of procrastinations in the disbandment question, gives colour to the French contention that Monarchism and the old German spirit are at the back of the advance into the reserved area.. The former practice of the Nbske Government of interfering arbitrarily in the business affairs of the Capitalist class, will not make matters more easy for them now that they have been thrown back upon the Reactionaries to whom so many of the former Capitalists still adhere.It is reported that in the event of the Red Revolution proving successful, the Sparticists had appointed various dictators. As long as that hope subsisted, their calculations in case of only partial success led them to a probable co-operation with the Left Indepen-dents. Legien, the head of the Trade Union movement, is even said at that time to have been trying to moderate the extreme section of his party who were insisting on great concessions to the Left in Government appointments.2. German Trade and Political Relations with Soviet Russia.Industrial discussions between the German Government and Victor Kopp, the Soviet representative in Berlin, are being carried on through Professor Hollmann, the Independent Socialist.The main subjects of consideration are agricultural machinery and implements. It is rumoured that the Soviet Governments proposal to encourage the settlement in the provinces of Saratov, Tambow and Toula of a German colony of 50,000, including notably railway engineers, is also under discussion.There is a reliable report to the effect that an agreement has been arrived at between Kopp and Schlesinger, who is virtually head of the Russian Department of the German Foreign Office. The agree-ment concerns concessions to be granted to German industries in Soviet Russia, the German Government undertaking to despatch German chemists and medical stores to Russia in exchange for facilities given to Germans wishing to develop plantations for medical herbs in Turkestan, Fergana, Vologda, Olonetz and Perm.Towards the middle of March Rakow3ky, the Bolshevik represen-tative in the Ukraine, is reported to have joined Kopp in Berlin for a conference with the German authorities. Germany has for some time been supporting the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine with officers and
war material and it is more than probable that she will send industrial and agricultural representatives as well.A Central Emigration Organization to Soviet Russia has been set up in Leipzig with Russian money. The number of German com-munists ready to proceed to Russia is said to be 10,000.Ernst Kauffmann, who was reported as carrying on German Secret Service activities in Basle (see Report No. 17, under Switzer-land) is now said to belong to a Russo-Germau Bolshevik organization in Stockholm, which he represents at Copenhagen. He is working with Vorowski, the former Bolshevik Minister in Stockholm, and has large funds at his disposal for propaganda purposes.The fact that aeroplane communication exists between Germany and Russia is confirmed by the forced landing near Kovno on the 12th March of a Russian aeroplane. The passengers were found to be furnished with powers by Lenin and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, authorising them to carry out far-reaching commercial agreements with Germany. Another aeroplane, German this time, carrying 350,000,000 roubles and other cargo for Russia came down in Bessarabia and was captured by the Roumanians.Kopp, the Soviet agent in Berlin, applied to the Danish Govern-ment for permission to confer with Krassin in Denmark before the latter conies to Great Britain.3. Relations between the Soviet Government and the German Monarchists.When discussing the Bolshevik menace in the latter part of February, General Ludendorff stated to the British representative in Berlin that many of his friends were disposed, failing support fr m the Allies, to turn in their despair to the Russian Soviet Govern-ment and to endeavour to come to an agreement with it with a view to joint action against the Entente.Shortly before this utterance of ludendorff&apos;s, which confirms previous reports concerning an alliance between the Russian Bolsheviks and the Monarchists in Germany, the Swedish banker, Aschberg, had been negotiating with a group of German financiers for a loan to the Soviet Government. The negotiations were carried on under instructions from Litvinoff and Goukovski, president of the Bolshevik Economic Commission in Esthonia, and a credit of 100 million marks for the Soviet Government is said to have been obtained. The securities given were in foreign bonds and bonds of those Russian railways which were then controlled by the Bolsheviks.American capitalists are reported to be connected with German Industrial Syndicates in Norway and Sweden interested in railway and banking possibilities in Russia. The directors of these syndicates are said to be working through Hellberg at Stockholm, who is in direct touch with the Soviet Government.It is reported from Geneya that the Germans have sent engineers into Russia to build munition factories, and that the Red Army is said to be staffed to a considerable extent by members of the German Monarchist Party, who are preparing an offensive for May.
The parties of German officers who proceeded to Soviet Russia via Finland, early in February are said to have been met by dis tinguisbed Bolshevik generals. These missions proceed to Russia ostensibly to look after the German prisoners still remaining there, but there is every reason to believe that they are being used in the reconstruction of the Soviet Army.4. Communist Germany,The Workmen&apos;s Councils formed in Bavaria during the German Revolution are said no longer to have political significance. Their cost is about 60,000 marks per month, the burden being laid entirely upon the Communes.Revolutionary parties in Saxony are believed to be well financed, partly from Russia. 46,000 of the workmen in Dresden, Zwickau and Chemnitz are armed.The Workmen&apos;s movement in the Ruhr district has enrolled all men between 18 and 45 and compelled them to dig trenches and to fight.A recent report based upon statements of a notorious Communist leader shows that it is now realised by certain of the Communists that Germany was not ripe for Communism, and this, together with a lack of food and ammunition, make the prospects of a revolution hopeless.In the Ruhr revolt the Communists, realising that the Democratic Government rested solely on military support and was bound to end in a military dictatorship which would produce much the same conditions in Germany as before the war, had begun the introduction of a Rate or Soviet system throughout Germany by the formation of Executive Committees. This was done during the confusion of the general strike which followed the &quot; Putsch&quot; by Kapp and his associates.The general policy of the workers is stated to have been against violence, which was to be resorted to only if the- Militarist Party openly resisted the formation of Soviet Governments. If no military resistance were offered the means employed were to be strikes and sabotage and it was hoped that a considerable advance of Government troops in the Ruhr district would be the signal for another general strike throughout Germany.It appeared from the statements of reliable authorities that the whole move towards the Soviet or Rate system in Germany would be based on economic and not on political grounds, though at the same time the Communists maintained that the only system which would enable all political opinions to be represented was the Rate-republik.At the second meeting of the Third International at Amsterdam it was stated that the Hamburg Opposition Group of the German Communist Party intends to probe to the bottom the embezzlement of 2,000,000 marks received by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party from the Soviet Government for distribu-tion among Russian prisoners of war in Germany.5. Economic Germany.Reports agree in stating that lack of coal is hampering manu-facfcures and commerce.  The Reichsbank return shows that in the
middle of March, 100,000,000 marks were being put into circulation daily. Despite these disquieting figures the situation was regarded as likely to improve. Men&apos;s minds were being gradually bent to their work again and to see that only this could bring about the economic restoration of their country. Owing to the lack of coal, however, the men have been able to work only a few hours a day, and idleness gave them time to discuss grievances. Meanwhile, manufacturers in occupied territory are described as booked up with orders for months ahead, which only lack of coal prevents them from executing.Switzerland.The Swiss Socialist Party has openly declared for the Third International, and refused to participate in the &quot;Reconstruction&quot; International.There has been a marked recrudescence of Bolshevik propaganda in Switzerland since the French Socialist Congress at Strasbourg, and early in March the Swiss Authorities seized a large number of Bolshevik pamphlets at the German frontier. On the 10th of March an aeroplane with a German pilot and mechanic, with papers under the West Russian Government, was obliged to land near Kovno. Among the passengers was Fritz Platten, the leader of the Communist Party in Switzerland, who is still under sentence of six months&apos; imprisonment for his participation in the strike riots of November 1918. Platten was carrying vouchers bearing Trotsky&apos;s and Tchitcherin&apos;s signatures and about  300 in notes.During the Red rising in Germany the Swiss Socialists and Revolutionaries hoped that the Spartacist movement would extend to Switzerland and eventually through the whole of Europe. The Party of Order countered by neglecting no opportunity of pointing the anti-Bolshevik moral as afforded by the situation in Germany.A certain amount of unrest among the railway workers in Switzer-land is reported. They are said to be moving towards the Left. The Railwaymen&apos;s Union has levied a tax of 5 francs per member towards a battle fund. It is calculated, however, that if a general strike took place only about 50 per cent, of the railwaymen would actually come out.John de Kay (vide March Report, Germany) is reported to be moving to and fro between Switzerland and Berlin. He left Lucerne for Friedrichshafen on the 26th of February and by the 29th was reported to be endeavouring to return to Switzerland from Berlin, where he was said to have seen Erzberger, Rauscher and Count von Reventlow. The Swiss Authorities have, however, refused to allow him to re-enter the country.Austria.In the course of a conversation on the situation in Austria from a revolutionary point of view, Toman, the leader of the Austrian Communists, stated that he was in constant touch by couriers several times a week with Lenin, on the one hand, and with Communists in Italy on the other. Despite assiduous propaganda, Steinhardt, the Moscow emissary, met with little success among the printers, the majority of whom declared themselves opposed to Bolshevik principles.
Voikswehr troops at Vienna are said to be largely controlled through a system of agents by the Vienna Communist Party. Dr. Mataja&apos;s Wehr-reform Bill, by which, instead of a militia under the control of soldiers&apos; councils, a new Voikswehr is to be created with peasant forces in the provinces, met with considerable opposition from the Communist portion of the Voikswehr. On Sunday, the 14th of March, these men were to demonstrate against the Pill. The proposal put forward by Dr. Eldersch, State Secretary for Home Affairs, and Dr. Deutsch, State Secretary for Military Affairs, was that on this occasion a couple of battalions of the Voikswehr, armed, were to do police duty and maintain order instead of the regular police. The President of Police refused and told the Ministers that their policy was a danger to the State and that the police alone must maintain order.On the morning of the 13th of March, when the news of the coup d&apos;state in Berlin became public property, Eldersch and Deutsch, in their extreme alarm at the probable counter-effect of that reactionary event, which the Communists would certainly exploit to their own advantage, actually came to the Police President for advice. President Schober cleverly proposed that a large Social Democrat demonstration should take the place of the Communist demonstration and engulf it. The Ministers saw that the demon-stration could not be entirely suppressed without great trouble, and the Police Presidents plan was adopted. The enlarged demon-stration passed off in the main very satisfactory. 1,500 Com-munists took part and tried, without success, to rally at the Votiv-Kirche.Meanwhile the pan-German meeting planned for the same day was suppressed as too dangerous, while the Voikswehr was otherwise engaged and to some extent appeased by an Inspection Parade in which State Secretary Deutsch took part.During the revolutionary coup in Germany, rumours were current of a Monarchist movement, which, if the Berlin affair had been successful, was to take place in conjunction with a similar coup d&apos;state in Hungary. Admiral Horthy was reported to be in constant touch with ex-Feld-Marschall von Beck in Vienna. A delegation of the Austrian &quot; Oitiziersbund&quot; called upon the German Minister in Vienna, presumably with the idea of consulting him as to supporting the movement. The German Minister refused to receive the delegation. The Communist leaven in the Voikswehr and in the industrial centres probably made it dangerous to proceed with these plans.Hungary.Alexander Semadam, former Vice-President of the National Assembly, has formed a new Government in place of that of M. Huzar. The Bolshevik Party in Hungary appear to be confident of regaining their hold over the country by November. They have no immediate revolutionary intentions, however, and intend to carry on propaganda in the hope that a Bolshevik environment may finally bring about bloodless revolution.Bela Kun has written a reply to the protest of the British Labour Party against the White Terror in Hungary, thanking them
for their moral support and urging them to address a similar note to the Austrian Government.The trials of Hungarian Communists who served under Bela Kun, considered as a means of public revenge against Bolshevism, are reported to be moderate, but from the point of view of the administration of justice they are severe in comparison with normal times.It was rumoured in March that the Archduke Max, brother to the ex-Emperor Karl, had been chosen as future King of Hungary.Czecho-Slovakia.Though trouble was expected both in the big towns of Czecho-Slovakia and in Northern Bohemia in general as soon as the food shortage began to be seriously felt, the anticipation that Bolshevism has, as yet, no real hold in the country has been fulfilled. Although in February the Social Democratic press was full of Bolshevik articles which seemed to show that the leaders of the Majority Socialists were leaning towards the Left under working-class pressure, when the news of the establishment of Workmens Councils in German industrial centres came there were no indications in Czecho-Slovakia of any marked swing to the Left.The Bolsheviks apparently have tv/o centres in Czecho-Slovakia, both of them nominally under the leadership of Muna. That for Bohemia is in Pilsen and that for Moravia and Silesia is at Olmiitz. Funds for these centres are reported to come partly from Moscow and partly from the proceeds of forged 50-mark notes, manufactured in Konigshiitte. 60,000 to 100,000 marks monthly is said to be spent on Bolshevik agitation.Hungarian Communists pretend to think that the geographical situation of Czecho-Slovakia in Central Europe is very favourable to Communist aims. The Czech authorities, however, regard their activities as part of the general Magyar agitation to separate Slovakia from the Czech State.4. RUSSIA AND BORDER STATES. Soviet Russia. 1. Efforts to obtain Peace and Recognition.In its main lines the trend of Bolshevik foreign policy is now abundantly clear. With the final despatch of Denikin the military and also, as far as immediate world revolution is concerned, the militant phase is regarded as over. The resumption of trade relations with foreign countries with its ultimately inevitable complement of a full recognition of these by the Soviet Government is the next stage in its development. But the recognition of parliamentary and democratic institutions abroad, which constitutes the Eussian side of the bargain, will be the recognition by a workman of material to be refashioned. Bolshevik propaganda will adapt itself to the methods by which each country has won its liberties in the past, and will work in their sense only until the time comes to emerge from the bonds in which it has straitened itself.   The economic difficulties of
the day and the high cost of living throughout Europe are its opportunity. By working upon these it trusts to make any regime of capitalism, however broad based, impossible, and to impose the Third International by strike and revolution. For though there may be truth in the statement of Maxim Gorky that Lenin, Tchitcherin and Krassin are for making peace with the outside world and gradually changing the method of Government to more constitutional lined, the complement of that statement, that Trotsky and Dzerzhinsky are still for an aggressive policy and for adhering completely to Bolshevik tenets, must not be forgotten.Tchitcherin, the Soviet Commissary for Foreign Affairs, recently stated that he did not consider world revolution necessary for the continued existence of a Soviet State in Russia and there was no reason why trade relations should not be resumed and concessions offered to capitalist nations without sacrificing Communist principles. Kameneff, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet, has recently expressed the opinion that intercourse with Western Europe necessarily entails diplomatic relations. On the subject of the visit to Russia of the delegation from the League of Nations Kameneff said that all bond fide commissions were welcome to make an impartial investigation, but that the Soviet Government reserved the right to send similar commissions to other countries.The Bolsheviks are desperately anxious for peace all round and are using all means, whether direct or tortuous, to secure it. They have addressed another letter to the Foreign Ministers of the Entente urging them to press for peace. A certain Yaponsky in the Crimea, who styles himself the &quot; Soviet Plenipotentiary Representative for the Near East,&quot; has written to the Russian Representative in Constan-tinople, urging him to hand over the Embassy to the Soviet Government in return for a sufficient sum to cover the expenses of closing it down. The Russian representative^ safety and a sufficient sum for his maintenance are guaranteed. This seems to be merely a ruse on the part of the Soviet Government to enhance its prestige in foreign countries a id to induce recognition by all foreign States.According to Tchitcherin the Soviet Government favours the belt of Independent States on the Western confines of Russia. It hopes to use its policy of making peace with those Border States, in which it believes itself to be at one with the Entente, as a lever towards peace in Western Europe.Klishko, one of the co-operative representatives to this country, recently returned to Moscow, it is believed on account&quot;of a disagree-ment which had arisen between him and Litvinoff. Both are thought to be anxious for the post of Bolshevik representative in England, when diplomatic relations between England and Russia are resumed; and Klishko proceeded to Moscow lo place his case before his Government. Formerly employed by Messrs. Vickers as an engineer, he was virtually deported from this country with Litvinoff s party in 1918.2. Russian Bolshevik Designs Abroad.Information was received in February that Tchitcherin recently sent instructions to the Comrades in England to give special support
to tho miners in the Ehondda Valley, with the object of provoking a revolutionary movement in England this spring. All strikes are to be encouraged, and the miners in the Ehondda Valley are to fight for an increase of 30s. a week. A similar course is to be adopted by the Communists in Fiance and Italy with the purpose of starting a general revolution in Western Europe within the next few months.The Soviet Government suggested in February that Litvinoff should go to Sweden, where he would have more freedom of action than in Copenhagen. Its purpose was manifestly to put Litvinoff in touch with Frederick Strom for the purpose of Bolshevik activity in Western Europe. The proposal has, after some delay, found favour with the Swedish Government.It was reliably reported lale in March that the Soviet Govern-ment had recently issued plans for revolutionary action in Germany, England, United States, Italy, Japan, France, Belgium, Portugal, Spain and Holland, and also to the Dutch and British Indies. Each plan is said to be accompanied by a code, and instructions were to be sent by wireless from the 1st of April onwards.The Bolshevik Government has made no secret of the fact that it employs a so-called &quot; Black Army &quot; of officials to forge and utter foreign paper money. The machinery comes from Germany. There can be no question of private forgery.  3,000 of spurious Bank of England notes from Odessa were passed in a deal with a London firm. The notes are calculated to deceive the ordinary public and might even pass a banker should he not be on the look-out for them.3. Russian Internal Politics.At the Seventh All-Eussian Soviet Conference recently held at Moscow the representative of the Jewish Bund Party severely criticized the Bolshevik authorities, saying that the power was entirely in the hands of the Executive Committees, while Soviets were not regularly re-elected and practically never convoked. Martoff, the leader of the Menshevist Party, made a similar protest and stated that if the Communist Party wanted to see the population co-operate with the Soviets, it must carry out reforms which would make the people consider the Soviet system, not as the lesser evil, but as a factor for positive good.Baranow and Lenin excused themselves for failing to convoke the Soviets on the plea that Communists were too busy on the frontier fighting the enemies of the revolution. Lenin declared that the Bolshevik system did not promise freedom and equality to the- whole of the population, but only to workmen and peasants, and that the Soviet Government could not crush the bourgeoisie and speculation without the help of the Chrezvichaika.4. Economic Notes.Decreased production in Soviet Eussia was reported in February to be largely due to the hard conditions of life among the workers, who were only obtaining enough for bare subsistence. Citizens of the first category have latterly been receiving three-quarters of a pound of bread for two days and a daily communal dinner, largely consisting of vegetable soup.
The great majority of the population is compelled to acquire two-thirds of its daily food in the open market at impossible prices The death-rate figures show an increase since 1917 of 50 per thousand per annum, while birth-rate figures for the same period show a decrease of 3 per thousand.From information received from an official source it is clear that even the main transport roads will not be in working order before the end of 1920. It would appear that the Moscow-Ekaterinburg railway is not yet working up to the latter place, though it is hoped it may do so by the 1st of July. Regular traffic on it, however, is not expected before October.Not more than a quarter of the necessary material is available for the continued operation of the Metallurgical Works.There seems little prospect of obtaining grain for some time to come. The Commissar of Supplies has estimated that he will need a store of a least 324 million poods of grain to feed the people till next harvest. Up to the end of last year he had not gathered in 30 per cent, of this amount. Flax crops dropped in 1919 to less than 1\ per cent, of the normal yield, and there is now an estimated reduction to two-thirds of the yield in 1919. In view of this it is unlikely that Russia will be able to send either grain or flax abroad.Money is being dispensed with in Moscow and will be so later in Petrograd. The system of issuing coupons for the purchase of commodities has led to strikes in factories round Petrograd.5. The Red Army.General Brussiloff issued a proclamation in February calling upon Russian officers abroad to return to their country and enter the Russian National Army. Rumours of a Bolshevik spring offensive against the Poles and Roumanians have not abated, but it seems doubtful whether the Soviet Army is at present capable of carrying out operations on a large scale.6. German Intrigues at Archangel.There is evidence of the complicity of the Germans in the intrigues which brought about the collapse of the North-West Russian Army at Archangel and Murmansk. Propaganda literature found in January last at Archangel bore unmistakable signs of German origin. The chief culprit is reported to have been Kvitzinsky, who is reliably said to have been in German pay. Later advices confirm the fact of German connivance. The Archangel front was treacherously given up by the Whites on an agreement between General Miller&apos;s staff, Finland, Germany and the Bolsheviks. In the middle of March the Germans were urging Russian refugees to join General Gurko&apos;s reactionary forces.7. Siberia.In the course of a recent speech delivered at Moscow, Lenin said that stringent measures must be taken to prevent free trade in Siberia, which was rich in every kind of product. Free trade would only enable peasants who possessed surplus grain to exploit their brothers and so become enemies of the working class.
The Russian Telegraph Agency at Moscow have transferred 5,000,000 roubles to the Siberian Department for purposes of propaganda.Siberia believes that the Japanese have arrived at an agreement with the Bolsheviks in return for concessions. Peasants in West Siberia are reported to be dissatisfied with Bolshevik rule and to be attempting to establish a democratic rSgime.8. South Russia.General Denikin&apos;s final defeat was preceded by his desertion by the Kuban Cossacks, who are believed to have been largely responsible for the fall of Novorossisk. There were indications in March that the Germans were preparing to take over the anti-Bolshevik move-men t after the withdrawal of the Allies. In this connection Ivan Alexandrovitch, who participated in the organization of the Astrakhan Army against the Bolsheviks on German money, reappeared in Kkaterinodar. He is Monarchist and pro-German. His programme is said to consist in putting forward for candidature General Krassnoff, late Ataman of the Don, for the position of Prime Minister of the Southern Government under German patronage.Finland.The issues between peace and war, reaction and moderatism, are very acute in Finland at present.   Though Erich has succeeded in forming a Right Centre Coalition Gnvernment, containing six Monarchist pro-Germans, four Agrarians and three Progressives, it is thought that it will be short lived.   The Finnish General Staff is very nervous of a Bolshevik attack, being by no means certain of the moral of the Army, and Holsti, the Foreign Minister, the only member of the Cabinet said to be decidedly ^vo-Hntente, has for some time been carrying on peace negotiations with the Soviet Govcrn-ment.   Social Democrats in Finland are very anxious concerning the attitude of Mannerheim, who is at once violently anti-British and definitely opposed to peace with Soviet Russia.   His influence on the present Government is said to be great.   Mannerheim is said to favour a union with Poland in a joint attack on the Bolsheviks.   He is even reported not to be averse to an attack by the Russians, in the hope that it might make it possible for him to assume the dictator-ship.    If the balance should sway towards peace and if the negotiations look like coming to anything it is possible that the Finnish Government may then consider the advisability of deporting such reactionaries, who might attempt a White coup oVttat.   The Finnish Government has been insistent on the immediate evacuation of Petchenga by the Soviet Government, the town and district of which are held in strength by Soviet troops.   It is rumoured that the Bolsheviks are now trying to sound Norway as to whether she has aspirations in the region, hoping by an agreement with her to embarrass the Finns.Among the Reds there do not appear to be any strong leaders. The high cost of living and a feeling that they would like to see the power in the hands of the proletariat is causing unrest among the
working classes. This feeling, liowever, is reported to be in some degree artificial and to he fostered by Eed agitators. There are said to be preparations in the lied ranks for a rising should a favourable opportunity occur, and strikes and disturbances are possible in the near future. It is generally thought, however, that any such attempt on the part of the Reds will fail unless the Russian Bolsheviks come into Finland. A Red rising might have a temporary success in Viborg, but would not have sufficient backing by other districts.Should the Russian Bolsheviks make a determined attack on Finland conditions might alter considerably. The Finnish Army is not to be depended on to put up much of a fight against Soviet troops, and there is danger in the fact that the part of Finland closest to the Russian frontier is the Reddest.Interest among members of the Finnish Schiitz-Korps is reported to be waning. It is thought that not more than 50 per cent., or at most 60 per cent., would turn out in case of necessity. The question is not one of Redness but simply of apathy.Amongst officers of the Finnish Army there is also considerable friction from the placing of the Jaeger officers in senior positions. Those who joined the German Army during the war and returned to Finland with non-commissioned rank are&apos; being promoted over Finnish officers.  Discontent is therefore considerable.The Kapp &quot;Putsch&quot; and its consequences caused considerable excitement in Finland. The Extreme Left was at first much depressed. Later news, however, enlivened them and discouraged the bourgeoisie. Germans and pro-Germans have recently seemed to look upon the situation as brighter, believing that the Left element in Germany will be unable to do much, and that the movement there will eventually turn to the benefit of the Right.Baltic States.Esthonia.Esthonia appears to be gradually moving towards the Left and the Bolsheviks have begun to interfere seriously in the internal affairs of the State. The Esthonian Authorities are preparing to set apart a portion of the Port of Reval for Bolshevik use.The decision of the Esthonian Government to nationalize the land of the peasants is likely to cause trouble and may lead to a rising against the Government. There is, in fact, ,yreat dissatisfaction in Esthonia against the Government and it is rumoured that a new Ministry will shortly be formed under the leadership of Hanko, the present Minister for War.Since the signing of peace between Esthonia and Soviet Russia a large number of Bolshevik agents have crossed the frontier and have actively engaged in subversive propaganda. A meeting between the Esthonian Communist leaders and the comrades from Petrograd took place on the 7th of February. It was decided that in the event of hostilities being resumed a general strike would be called among Esthonian workers in factories and on railways. Troops of the regular army were to be urged to mutiny and go over to the Bolsheviks.
Latvia.Soviet intrigues to incite Lettish workmen against the middle classes are making it impossible for the Lettish Government to contemplate complete demobilization. Although the economic situation and unreliability of the army make Latvia anxious to enter into peace negotiations with Soviet Russia, there are indications that the Latvian Government is anxious to delay the conclusion of peace, firstly, because it fears the political fight with the Bolsheviks winch would necessarily follow, and secondly, because it is anxious to act in conjunction with the other Border States. The Latvian Peace Delegation has left for Moscow.It is believed that in the negotiations Latvia will endeavour to obtain flax and timber concessions in Russian territory adjoining her borders. In this case the sale of flax would undoubtedly become a Government monopoly since the Lettish Government would obtain a still stronger hold over British flax spinners, a situation inimical to British trade interests might arise.Lithuania.Many officers of the North-West Russian Army are stated to have gone over to Germany where they are being recruited by Gutchkoff, Gurko and Rodzianko. The latter appears to have finally allied himself with the pro-German reactionaries in Berlin, and is even said to have advised the Germans to erect their explo-sive factories in Russia where the Entente would be unable to control them.An agreement between Germany and Lithuania is reported. The former is to supply the Lithuanians with rolling-stock, ostensibly for action against the Bolsheviks, but in reality for use against Poland. Gutchkoff went to Kovno about this and tried to get leave for Russian White troops to pass from Germany through Lithuania to the Bolshevik front, in consideration for which favour the Lithuanians were to be offered the town of Vilna.Poland.According to a statement by the Polish Prime Minister, the Government is not at all anxious about the Bolshevik offensive. Reports which have been circulated about Bolshevik outbreaks in Poland are whollv unfounded and may be traced to a German source. Although a certain amount of Bolshevik propaganda is going on and the economic situation is undoubtedly precarious, it seems probable that such disturbances as may occur will be confined to the large towns. Generally speaking the peasants in the country districts are fairly content and appear to obtain sufficient food for themselves with-out much difficulty, disposing of any surplus to the Jews at highly profitable prices. An informant who recently returned from a tour in the Posen district was particularly struck with the prosperous appearance of the country. Roads, railways, telegraphs and tele-phones were good and numerous. Some of the quite small towns had electric light and the housing was much superior to that of Russian Poland.   The cost of living in Posen appears to be about
one-third of what it is in Warsaw, and bread costs 2 marks a-pound, whereas in Warsaw it is now 22 marks a pound.Taking it all over, Bolshevism seems to have made little progress, and a general Bolshevik outbreak seems very unlikely. Contrary reports are spread by the Germans with two definite objects in view, first, to influence the voting in the plebiscite areas in favour of Germany, since electors may be supposed to prefer to belong to a stable rather rather than an unstable State; secondly, to justify the retention by the Germans of the material of war, and possibly of a very strong army.Brussiloff, who in February was reported to be largely responsible for Bolshevik military policy, was apparently not in favour of attacking Poland, at any rate until Denikin should have been disposed of. Poland is reported to have entered into a contract with the United States Liquidation Board, by which she is to get as many surplus American Army supplies as she may require on a credit basis of six years at 5 per cent.The Bolshevik offensive against the Poles which began towards the end of March appears to have been repulsed in all sectors. Peace negotiations are projected, but have come to a deadlock before their inception on the question of where they should take place. The Poles proposed Borisov, which the Soviet authorities rejected, possibly on the ground that the choice of that locality would bring about an armistice on the left of their front, which would expose the Ukraine to Polish penetration. The Soviet Government will under no circum-stances consent (1) to a reversion to the frontiers of 1772, (2) to the independence, modified or absolute, of the Ukraine or Lithuania.Despite the recommendation of the British Police mission in Poland the authorities appear unwilling to pay police officials adequately. Without better conditions efficiency in that force is unlikely to improve.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.Roumania.The Roumanian Cabinet resigned on the 15th of March. The immediate cause of their failure appears to have been the agitation of the landowners against the Expropriation Bill, which created a peasant proprietary by making it possible for every peasant to own his own land. It is described as one of the most radical measures ever proposed in Roumania.It is not yet certain whether General Averescu, the new Prime Minister, will be able to maintain a majority in the Chamber, but even in the event of defeat it is reported to be his intention not to have new elections until next autumn, so as not to interfere with the peasants&apos; work in the fields. His programme entails considerable concessions to the peasants and it is hoped that once in possession of the land they will cultivate it more intensively than last autumn, so forestalling a serious shortage of bread next winter.On the whole the Roumanian peasant, despite the existence of certain Bolshevik peasant organizations, appears to have little sympathy with Bolshevism, and it is thought that a Bolshevik
attack on the country would have small chance of success. Rakowsky, the Soviet representative in the Ukraine, apparently had designs for an offensive against Roumania, but is now said to be out of favour with the Soviet Government. The Roumanian Social Democratic Party, on the other hand, is undoubtedly strongly tainted with Bolshevism and is an impediment to the Government in considering the question of peace with Soviet Russia.The Soviet Government, in a wireless message to the Roumanian Prime Minister, suggested Kharkoff was a suitable place for such peace negotiations. It is also suggested, possibly in order to make mischief between Poland and Roumania, that the Ukrainians should be asked to participate in the negotiations since no territorial questions could be raised without Ukrainian participation.Litvinoff refused to discuss the question of repatriation of prisoners with the Roumanian representative who visited him at Copenhagen unless a general treaty of peace between the Roumanians and Soviet Russia was also settled. The Roumanian representative took away the impression that the Soviet Government was anxious to score a moral, if not a military, triumph by detaching Roumania from other Border States. Litvinoff stated to him that the Soviet Govern-ment recognised the right of self-determination in Bessarabia.Bulgaria.Stambolisky, the present Prime Minister of Bulgaria, is described as an Ententophile Agrarian of unusual energy, honesty and patriotism. He is firmly resolved to suppress disorderly elements and the authors of the numerous bomb outrages reported, which might tend to impede reconstruction. He is for the formation of an Agrarian International to counter-balance the Socialist International. Agrarian organizations already exist in Bulgaria, Roumania, Croatia, Hungary and Czecho-Slovakia, and M. Stambolisky believes that the Agrarian International would soon gain adherents in all these countries and so cut the ground under the feet of advancing Bolshevism.The Communist Party in Bulgaria would appear to be primarily pan-Bulgar. Their nominal leader, M. Blageoff, considers that self-determination for the Bulgars in Macedonia, Dobroudja and Thrace can only be achieved through universal Communism. He is, however, opposed to premature revolution and regards the present strike movement as detrimental to the cause. The Narrow Socialist Party in Bulgaria, whose programme is that of the Russian Bolsheviks, is barred from any access to power with the assent of the nation by the individualism of the peasant proprietors, who compose the bulk of the army. This party is supported only by riff-raff and (Mclassis in the towns, who wish to live as parasites or by robbery.Refugees from South Russia are crowding into Bulgaria, which cannot accommodate them. Local Communists are taking advantage of their distress to spread Bolshevik propaganda, and many of the ex-officers from General Denikin&apos;s army now openly avow themselves Bolsheviks.The strike declared early in March by the extremists in the railways, posts, telegraph and telephones was aimed at M. Stam-bolisky.    It was fruitless,    Stambolisky refused  negotiations, [2893] D
dismissed many pf the strikers and had a considerable number arrested and tried by court-martial. The workmen finally submitted to his terms. Improved transport and better food supply are said to be easing the situation.Exceptional interest was taken in Bulgaria in the Paisley bye-election and great importance was attached to Mr. Asquith&apos;s saying that the terms of the Peace Treaty were only provisional.A Bulgarian Islamic Committee, with Stamat Stamoff as secre-tary, has been formed in Berlin to work in with the Turkish Pan-Islamic Committee. Its activities are mainly directed to anti-Greek policy in Thrace. A secret Turkish Bureau run by Etkhem Rouhy, a friend of Enver Pasha, who sometimes acts as intermediary for Enver&apos;s correspondence with Berlin, is reported at Pravadia in Bulgaria.Greece.Peeling towards Great Britain is extremely good at present. It is generally believed that the successful issue of Greek claims to Thrace and Smyrna is due to English support.Owing to M. Venizelos&apos; overtures to Labour after his last return from Paris, M. Embericos, the Capitalist leader of the Bight Wing of the Democratic Party, has decided to secede from the Venizelist Party and to form a new group. Monarchist effort is being directed to preparing for the general election, which is regarded as certain some time this year.There is definite evidence of a new plot to assassinate M. Venizelos on his mission to the West.The Constantinist organization at Lucerne is under the direction of George Sheif, at one time Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, and still political adviser to the ex-King, on whose bahalf he is very active. The Union Hellenique which functions under the direction Of Papadopoulos at Lucerne, is also active against Venizelos and the Entente. It issues a weekly paper at Geneva called the Echo of Greece, and was well known for its pro-German activities during the war. It is reported to have branches wherever Greek emigrants congregate. Constantinists in Switzerland are also reported to be in touch with the Young Turks, who by the overthrow, of Venizelos hope to obtain better conditions in Asia Minor. A meeting is said to have been held in March at St. Moritz, at which Djavid Bey, the ex-Minister of Finance, and Rifaat Pasha, Turkish ex-Minister and Ambassador, were present on behalf of the Young Turks, while the Greek Royalists were represented by Georges Sheif and Papadopoulos.The Piraeus Transport Syndicate recently received a document from the Antwerp Syndicate, recommending a general strike of Dockers and Transport workers to prevent the loading of war material for Denikin&apos;s army. This message was carried by a German steamer of the Deutsche Levant Line, which also carried messages from various Bolshevik agents in Holland.The landing of all Russian refugees in Greece who are not Greek subjects has now been prohibited. The rather insignificant Extreme Socialist Party in Greece has informed the Bulgarian Labour Party that it does not recognise the Greek annexation of parts of Thrace and Asia Minor.
6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. Turkey.The New Government.The Cabinet of Salih Pasha having resigned, Pamad Ferid Pasha&apos;s mandate to form a new administration was postponed until the approval of the leader, Mustapba Kemal, had been obtained. Mustapha Kemal has now declared that the seat of Turkish Authority is at Angora, the Sultan and Cabinet being held under duress at Constantinople.Pan-Islamic-cum-Bolshevik Propaganda.- In a proclamation drawn up by the Turkish Nationalist Propa-ganda Committee for despatch to Constantinople early in March, Bolshevism is described as the only force which the Mussulmans have at their command to-day and as in no way contrary to the tenets and principles of Islam. As a matter of fact these recognize and safeguard the rights of private property in every way.As indicated elsewhere, the alliance between pan-Islamism and Bolshevism does not seem to be prospering, the astuter Bolsheviks having become aware that it does not serve their ends. The pseudo-Pan-Islamic propagandists will probably have to revere to the religious agitations which the immensity and diversity of the Moslem world render so unprofitable except as a spectacle for European eyes. Nationalist propaganda in Constantinople was accordingly reported in March to be taking an anti-Christian rather than an anti-European tone.A recent form of this propaganda is the publication in Constanti-nople of distorted and exaggerated versions of the letter signed &quot; S.&quot; in the Times of the 3rd of February, which dealt with the situation in Central Asia. The Constantinople version contained a romantic account of Enver Pasha&apos;s activities. There is reason to attribute these versions to the Turkish War Office; a large number of copies are reported to have been sent to Anatolia.Another propaganda broadsheet before the occupation of Con-stantinople bore the fictitious Times article on one side and an alleged article from the Berliner Tageblatt on the other, alleging the   -weakness of the Entente and its impotence to force the Peace Treaty in face of resistance by the Central Powers.The object of these broadsheets was .to spread the impression that Great Britain had been forced to acquiesce in the retention of the Turkish Government at Constantinople, owing (o the recent successes of the Bolsheviks in conjunction with Turkish Nationalist forces which were represented as a vital clanger to Great Britain all over the globe.Despite official denials, there is reason to attribute the publication of these sheets to the Eed Crescent Society with the connivance of * Fevzi, the then Minister for War.Four Committees for Pan-Islamic and Nationalist propaganda are reported to exist in Constantinople and are said to be financed from Switzerland. Among these is an Association known as the &apos; Kharso Fikhar &quot; which is under the Presidency of Ahmed Riza Bey
and has its Headquarters at Lausanne. Djavid, ex-Turkish Minister of Finance, and Djemal Pasha are said to have a hand in the management and to supply funds.The islamic Committee in Berlin consists of forty-five members of various nationalities under Turkish direction. Its secretary is Ahmed Fouad Bey, a friend of Talaat. The Persian section is represented by Eechid Khan, the Egyptian by Mansour Bifaat and the Indian by Pillai. Connected with it there is an Islamic Organization at Stockholm which maintains communication with Russia through the connivance of the Swedish Socialists.Egypt.The high cost of living is the theme of all reports. The appli-cation of an efficient system of food control would go far towards calming Egyptian unrest and agitation. In some quarters, in fact, the present dearth is regarded as a blessing in disguise since it focuses what were before intangible grievances into a definite and not insoluble problem, common to all countries.The publication of the Nile projects seems to have allayed anxiety in the minds of the more reasonable Egyptians, while the increased Censorship is restraining misrepresentation. Sir William Willcocks, it is true, continues to distribute his pamphlets in Kasr-el-Nil, the most important street in Cairo.In the opinion of a correspondent Egypt cannot be healthily administered until its denationalized alien population, of which the greater part is still under the protection of the capitulations, is compelled to pay its share of taxation towards the education and relief of the Egyptians upon whom it battens. The British protec-torate would be more popular if Egyptians did not regard it as in part a protectorate of alien profiteers.The introduction of Indian troops into Egypt, where they are among fellow Muslims, has been criticized on account of their natural leanings towards secret propaganda and intrigue.German influence is making itself felt among the Egyptian students who are proposing to study in Europe. The German Government, with a view to&apos;fostering intrigue in Egypt on the same lines as in Constantinople before the war, is encouraging Egyptian students to come to Germany.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.Bolshevik policy in Central Asia was in the early part of March still strictly controlled from Moscow. It then appeared to be governed by a general nervousness as regards the possibility of English military action against Transcaspia. As long as the English are in Khorassan the Bolsheviks consider the whole of Turkestan to be in danger. They have realised that genuine Mohammedan Com-communism does not exist, and they were convinced that everywhere British agents were secretly preparing for a widespread rising of all Central Asiatic Mohammedans against them.
1There is evidence that before the closing of the Moslem Propaganda Bureau in Moscow (see Part II) Bolshevik propaganda amongst Mussulmans was not meeting with success. It had been grossly mishandled by certain Bolshevik Commissars and a special commission sent to Tashkent some months ago does not seem to have retrieved the situation. Tashkent seems to have been out of touch with Moscow, aud the Moscow Mussulman Bureau complained that for months at a time they were without information regarding the situation there.Persia.A report received by the Turkish Foreign Office shows British influence in Persia to be on the increase. There are indications, however, that the Persian Government does not see why it alone should be kept out of the movement towards an understanding with the Russian Soviet Government.The leaders of the Persian Committee in Berlin, amongst whom are Taki-Zadeh and Wahid-al-Molk, are now reported to be in touch with Bolshevik delegates from Moscow and Tashkent, and are basing their hopes on Bolshevik promises of freedom from British dornina-tion. Wahid-al-Molk, who was formerly in league with the Germans and lived in Berlin during the war, recently visited this country, from which he was deported as undesirable.Azerbaijan and Georgia.Strong pan-Islamic propaganda was being carried on in March in Azerbaijan by Turkish Nationalists of the Mouvahidin Society. This society is even reported to have been subsidized by the Azerbaijan authorities. The propaganda,however, is said not to have met with much success.Rumours of an alliance between the Young Turks and the Azerbaijan Government are confirmed by a report stating that an Afghan Delegation had arrived at Constantinople in order to form an alliance similar &quot;to that of Azerbaijan with the Young Turks.&quot;A defensive alliance exists between Azerbaijan and Georgia, which are agreed in principle on the formation of a Confederation to include Armenia. French influence, however, has been thrown against this policy, and the agreement has not taken effect.In Georgia German influence is reported to be at work, and a large Italian mission, working for Germany and supplied with German funds, arrived early in March at Tiflis. There are signs that this German influence has had some effect, the Georgian repre-sentative in London, who is known to have had strongly pro-British sympathies, having been removed from his post under the accusation by his Government of being in British pay.Bokhara and Afghanistan.An agreement was arrived at between the Amir of Bokhara and the Bolsheviks and Young Turks, by which in return for recognition, and an engagement on their part to refrain from incitement to disorder, the Amir undertakes to co-operate in pan-Islamic propaganda. The Amir of Bokhara also agreed to export grain to Russia and to
exchange Bolshevik currency in payment. He also allowed Bol-shevik subjects to come to Bokhara. The result has been the flooding of the country with Bolshevik notes, partly by the Bolsheviks, but even more by the Afghans, who seem to be unloading them.There are indications that the Bolsheviks are highly suspicious of the relations between Afghanistan and Bokhara. They regard Bravin, the Bolshevik representative at Kabul, as a trait&apos; &apos;r in the pay of the Afghans. Bravin has refused to return to Soviet Russia. An agreement is believed to exist whereby, if the Bolsheviks take Bokhara, the Afghans will come to its assistance.Four Afghan delegates are reported recently to have arrived in Constantinople, bearing messages to the Turkish Government from the Amir of Afghanistan, one of them to the effect that Afghanistan is anxious to enter into an agreement with Turkey similar to that already existing between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Turkish military officers are asked to reform the Afghan Army. The delegates are reported to have left for Angora on the 25th of February to see Musfapha Keinal, with whom they remained at least a fortnight.Dr. Suritz, the former Bolshevik representative at Copenhagen, is apparently having some difficulty on his mission to the Amir of Afghanistan. An anti-British peace at Kabul requires large con-cessions on his part to win the sympathy of the Amir, of which, for instance, the immediate arming of the Indian frontier tribes might constitute one.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. Japan.There has been much economic penetration by the Japanese in Siberia during the last three months, but it appears to have been forestalled and consequently hampered by similar activities on the part of the Chinese, whose ramifications were already widespread. The Japanese, benefiting by the abnormal shortage of manufactured goods, have been flooding the country with articles of inferior quality.The Japanese are said to be extremely unpopular in Siberia and to be meeting with considerable resistance on all hands. The supporters of the reactionary idea alone favour Japanese intervention and many even of these are half-hearted. Democrats of ail shades are opposed to it, and their resentment is shared by the urban populations and the peasantry.Underhand intrigues and a treatment of the peasants described as both cruel and overbearing are said to account for Japanese unpopularity.In default of improvement the Japanese Army in Siberia was described as not unlikely to emulate Koltchak in his failure against the Bolsheviks. The desire in Russian political circles at Vladivostock for the withdrawal of all foreign forces, took effect upon Japanese opinion.Bolshevik propaganda has not been slow to avail itself of differences said to exist between the Cabinet and the War Department of Japan on the question of the maintenance of troops in Siberia.
Japanese repressive measures against the Koreans are reported not to have been wholly successful. The movements for national independence with which the country is said to be seething are growing in power and consistency.The former German Naval Attache&quot; at Tokio has returned as correspondent of the Berliner Zeitung, but appears to have received special facilities for landing. He is well supplied with funds ami is actively cultivating relations with the Japanese.China.Japanese have been making trouble among the Mussulman population in the Chinese provinces Tchan-su, Si-Tchuan, Oin-Dzian, &amp;c, by distributing threatening proclamations. They are also furnishing malcontents with arms and money, undermining the authority of the Chinese Government and fomenting a feeling of irritation among the masses.9. BRITISH COLONIES. Canada.The growth of the One Big Union is said to be causing the Ottawa politicians grave concern. The metal miners of the Cobalt district went over to it early in March. There is reason to believe, however, that the movement is at present crippled by a shortage of funds, and its leaders are restricting their propaganda in Eastern Canada accordingly. The revolutionists are believed to attach importance to their plan to send agents to England (Jack Kayanagh, mentioned in the March report, is reported to be one) to make trouble among dock labourers loading ships for Canada. A young Jew, Moses Almayoff, much in favour with his party, may also b,e,sont?tp Russia. A strike in the lumber camps during the spring and sum uer seems probable. ,    .&apos;  ,  :Meanwhile, delegates of the One Big Union and other labour organizations got up a demonstration at Winnipeg in favour; of the release of the seven leaders of the Winnipeg strike, of whom five have been sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment for malicious conspiracy and one to six months&apos; for creating a common nuisance. The sentence was ill received and there were noisy protests and some fighting before the court could be cleared. The One Big Union has now called a general strike on May Day throughout the Dominion, in further protest against the convictions. ; -A secret committee of the Russian Workers&apos; Union is reported at Montreal, and is supposed to obtain funds from New York.The Canadian Council of Agriculture is opposing a clause inthe new Federal Franchise Act which prevents companies or associations from contributing money for political purposes. The Council suggests an amendment to the effect that such contributions-should be permitted but that their source must be disclosed. The farmers are aiming at raising 1,000,000 dollars for the next Federal&apos;election, and 700 agents are now canvassing Manitoba,
Employers of Manitoba have formed a provincial association representing twenty-five groups of trade and industry to work in with Union Labour so long as it restricts its activities to the betterment of its members and eschews political action. Another approach to co-operation is reported from Victoria, where 4,000 men employed on shipbuilding have agreed to a percentage of their wages being deducted and invested in the company.Australia.A dubious Labour majority was returned in the New South Wales elections, and the Governor was confronted with the question of whether he should send for the Premier&apos;.&apos;) lieutenant, Sir George Fuller, or for Mr. Storey, the moderate labour leader, as representing the strongest individual party. The latter course has subsequently been adopted.The Australian labour party has shown scant sympathy for its extremists. Mr. Minahan, a wealthy&apos; boot manufacturer with Republican leanings, sacrificed its support and was banned from the labour movement for seven years for indiscreet utterances and for urging the release of members of the Industrial Workers of the World.The same moderate tendency is now manifest in the Unions. After the strike of Marine engineers late in February, the more important Unions insisted publicly that no Union should strike before consulting its fellows, and that arbitration must precede any resort to &quot;direct action.&quot; The more recent tension among the seamen is due to the delay in giving effect to the Federal Navigation Act of 1912, which provides, among other things, for proper manning and for the comfort of the crews. Of two steamers held-up in Sydney one was allowed to sail when structural alterations had been promised, and the other when its complement of storesfhad been increased.   Clearly only particular abuses were aimed at.,  jmThe Congress of the United Chambers of Commerce has urged the Federal Government to arrange a conference between employers and employees to devise some method other than compulsory arbi-tration to settle the relations of Capital and Labour. It alleges the ineffectiveness of arbitration Tribunes to check strikes and prevent resort to direct action.Queensland business men will send a delegation to England to protest against the constitutional changes adumbrated in recent State legislation.New Zealand.Relations between Capital and Labour have improved. The press is discouraging extremist doctrines, and the reabsorption of soldiers in civil life is nearly complete.The recently elected Government is proving its strength by a firm and impartial control of Ihe inevitable rise in prices, which is on the whole less steep in New Zealand than elsewhere, with the . exception of Australia and South Africa.The coal miners&apos; agreement early in March provided for a wage increase over pre-war rates of 50 per cent, for piece work and 60 per cent for day work.   There is a scarcity of houses due to lack of -labour and materials.
South Africa.The South African elections resulted in the Government (South African Party) obtaining 40 seats, the Nationalists 44, Unionists 25, Labour 21, and Independents 3. Even if the South African Party and the Unionists coalesce, General Smuts is left in a dubious position.On the 3rd of April Parliament adjourned for a fortnights recess, after which it is hoped that a working basis for a future stable Government may be arrived at. The Nationalist Transvaal leader, Mr. Tielman Roos, has declared that any co-operation between the South African Party and the Nationalists must leave the latter free to continue Separatist propaganda. He singled out General. Hertzog as the only possible Prime Minister of such a Government.General Smuts will probably look to the Independents and the Labour Paity, as well as to the Unionists, to give him the necessary credits to carry on the Government. The&apos; pivot of the situation would therefore appear to be the Labour Party.The impression made by Lord Buxton&apos;s speech from the throne, outlining a ministerial programme of a national rather than of a partisan character, was excellent. This programme, which deals with such irritants as the high cost of living and announces industrial legislation of a conciliatory character, will have a real influence in calming popular agitation.Should Labour, under the leadership of Colonel Creswell, consent to support General Smuts, the soundest solution, of the political situation would seem to be a Cabinet reconstruction on a broad basis with General Smuts as Prime Minister.There is joy in the Nationalist press about Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s speech on Irish Home Rule. According to the Be Burger, General Hertzog&apos;s chief organ, Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s view that the granting of the Dominion status to Ireland would by itself give that country the right to self-determination, justifies the Nationalist standpoint with regard to the future independence of South Africa.In a letter published in the United States Negro World, Sol. D. Plaatje, leader of the South African Delegation to England, says that he has started a Brotherhood in Kimberley. The first World Brotherhood, he explains, met in London last September with himself as President of the Native Brotherhood. He announces that the next meeting will be at Washington, D.C., in May and that he hopes to be present with Afro-American friends.In an open letter to General Smuts, Dr. Purse, the Bishop of Pretoria and Bishop designate of St. Albans affirms that serious harm will arise unless the facts of the native situation are faced. The Bantu peoples, he says, have, during the past decade, become race-conscious. They have the idea that their labour is exploited solely for the benefit of the white man and they resent it. Dr. Furse advocates the appointment of native commissioners, and the establishment of native councils, to which legislation affecting the negro should be submitted.A native conflict with the police in Johannesburg on the 29th of February, which started with the stoning by the natives of two white constables, resulted in hospital casualties to 70 natives, 7 white [2893] E
police and 1 white civilian. The police used their batons. Other whites and natives used firearms.Jamaica.On the whole the negroes are less prone to unrest in Jamaica than elsewhere. Many of the best workers go to Cuba for a few years and put up with bad conditions in order to realise their dream of returning home with a pocket full of money and sitting idle under their own banana stump for the rest of their days. Nevertheless, during January Dr. James J. Edwards of the Oliver Sanatorium, Spanishtown, Kingston, addressing a meeting at Liberty Hall, New York, said he would have 200 nurses ready when the negro revolt came, for &quot; We of Jamaica will be with yon when the time comes for the great march, and the advance is called.&quot; Marcus Garvey, the chairman, said the German vision for a Great Central Africa had now been adopted by the negro race.Fiji.The agitation of negro workmen in Rewa and Suva (see March report: 17) subsided early in March. The New Zealand detachment sent to Fiji remained, as a precaution, during the trial of the strike leaders.South Georgia.The ubiquitous Russian Bolshevik has readied the British Island of South Georgia, east of the Falkland Islands. A strike amongst men employed in the whaling industry was promoted by thirty-six Russians who worked for the Compania Argentina de Pesca. At one time the situation threatened to assume ugly proportions, but the Company backed by the Authorities took a firm stand and discharged the malcontents who were at the same time fined under the Summary Jurisdiction Ordinance, whilst arrangements were made for their deportation to Buenos Aires. An attempt was made to call a general strike, but the men were got off the island, where-upon the remaining strikers immediately returned to work under the old terms.10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.The United States is faced with a railway strike which, starting in Chicago over the discharge of one man, finally spread largely throughout the country. The significance of the strike lies in the fact that it would seem to represent a struggle between the Radical and Conservative sections of Labour, for the men have broken away from their Unions. The strike has no declared leaders or clearly defined objective. The Brotherhood leaders in fact are energetically co-operating with the railway managers to break it and have summoned Union, men from other districts to work in the affected centres.The strike follows a conference which was held in Washington last month between the railway managers and their employees, at which a wage demand totalling over  200,000,000 sterling was put forward.   Other strikes are those of the New York Harbour workers
who demand an eight-hour day, and of Municipal clerks in Chicago for higher wages, the first example in America of such action by the middle-class worker. Belief in Trade Unionism is spreading amongst this section of Society and is said to be provoked by the irritation due to low wages. The American Federation of Teachers is now co-operating throughout the country with the Labour movement and is assisted by the Association of American Professors, a body which staffs many of the Labour Colleges.It is said that many Government workers are joining the Federal Employees&apos; Union, an aggressive body, whilst Police Unions are still active underground.Nothing on the scale of the former repression of extremists by the Government has taken place of late. ; Many of the persons then arrested have been released on bail from Ellis Island by Judge Knox, a measure which probably indicates the abandonment of proceedings. The Department of Labour has cancelled the Deportation warrants of more than 100 Reds who had been arrested by the Department of Justice. This may result in an enquiry into the conduct of the former.The Authorities in fact appear to be passing from repressive to educational methods. The cinema is being used, whilst the Congress Librarian, Mr. Putnam, has placed a sort of ban on books of an anarchical tendency and has suggested that other librarians should do likewise. Anti-radical organizations are now being widely formed with programmes more constructive and less merely destructive of Socialist fallacies.The more lenient tendency towards revolutionaries in the United States finds an echo in the news that the Government has decided to sanction the resumption of American commercial relations with Soviet Russia on the understanding that the American trader himself assumes responsibility for all financial risks. The American Manu-facturers&apos; Export Association has adopted a resolution warning its members as to the dangers to be run in trading with Russia under its present Government. The Authorities have also granted conditional permission to the Joint Distribution Committee of Jewish Relief Funds to send a relief Commission to Soviet Russia. The modification of the American policy towards Russia would appear to be in accordance with the trend of public opinion. It is perhaps unlikely, though it is possible, that the Ludwig Martens case may end by his deportation. A warrant in this sense has been issued on the charges that he is a German and a member of the Russian Communist Party. Martens has appeared before the Secretary of Labour and has flatly refused to discuss the charges on the ground that he is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Whilst taking steps against Martens the State Department has directed that the Ambassador of the late Admiral Koltchak, Boris Bahkmeteff, together with his staff, should leave the Embassy building by the 15 th of May and should deliver its contents to the American Authorities.Touching communications between the Bolsheviks of America and those of Russia, the United States Executive have been able to publish a collection of revolutionary documents which were taken from a Bolshevik courier en route to America.  The papers advocated [2893] E 2
revolution by violence, and for this purpose called upon the American Communists to ally themselves with the Independent Workers of the World. The arrest at Helsingfors, en route for America, is reported of the American journalist, John Reed, editor of tho Liberator. Reed, who had spent the past five months in Soviet Russia, was found to be carrying a million marks and documents referring to the Finnish Socialists.Bolshevik sympathisers have curiously enough been found amongst a few of the Russian priests in America. They having organized illegal meetings have been relieved from ecclesiastical duties by their Bishop, whom they defied. They have now founded Independent Russian Churches and are attempting to start an agitation in the Russian colQnies in America.The programme of the American Civil Liberties Union, the war-time National Civil Liberties Bureau is to fight for &quot; civil liberties in industrial conflicts.&quot; Professor Harry F. Ward of the Union Theological Seminary is the Chairman, and such well-known people as Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Morris Hdlquit of the Martens Bureau, together with James H. Maurer and Duncan McDonald, Presidents respectively of the Pennsylvania and Illinois States Federations of Labour, are serving on the Committee, as also is James Weldon Johnson of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People.The National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party has decided to hold a Convention in New York City on the 8th of May in order to nominate a candidate for the Presidential election. This will be the first Convention to be held since 1912, and is greeted by the Daily Herald as a &quot; Socialist revival.&quot; In co-operation with the American Freedom Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, the Socialists are arranging for a giant demonstration in reference to the imprisonment of Debs. In this connection it may be remembered that Debs&apos; name has been put forward as a candidate for the Presidential election (see January Report). The Party has applied for admission to the Third International.With regard to the much-discussed admission of five Socialists to seats in the New York State Legislature, the House has decided by an overwhelming majority on their expulsion. It is probable that this decision will be followed in three cases by recommendations that the naturalization papers of the men, who are of foreign birth, should be cancelled. The New York branch of the Communist Party has also to register a casualty, Witnitsky, its secretary, having been sentenced to a term of from five to ten years&apos; imprisonment on a charge of criminal anarchy.An interchange of visits has taken place between English and American intellectuals: Laurence Houseman, the British dramatist, has been lunching with the League of Free Nations, when attacks were made on the Lusk Committee and the Department of Justice, and Mr. Gleason, editor of the Survey, has been entertaining members of the Inter-Collegiate Socialist Society with impressions of England. Mr. Gleason found the British Labour Party stronger than the corres-ponding body in America, and believed that British Labour would shortly control England. He added that the English Parliament would never dare to go to the lengths of the American State Legisla-
ture, nor was it likely that investigating Committees similar to that presided over by Mr. Lusk would be set up in England, who had &quot; no time for continuous comic opera.&quot;The negro continues to attempt to parallel the activities of the white man, and Marcus Garvey has now announced the formation of a Negro Factories Corporation with a capital of 1,000,000 dollars. The idea is to build factories in Harlem and Brooklyn. Garvey declares that the Black Star Steamship Line is in a very satisfactory financial position. In connection with this Line a negro who claims to &quot;dislike the British&quot; has written anonymously to say that it is the intention of the Universal Negro Improvement Association to use the Line to smuggle armed and trained men, now being drilled by ex-soldiers, into Africa and the West Indies. They are known as the Universal African Legion and are under the command of D. Shirley, a partner of S. G. Kpakpa-Quartey, a merchant of Accra, Gold Coast. The Gold Coast is said to be in touch with the United States both through societies and printed propaganda. The latter, which is also despatched to Nigeria, arrives either direct or via the AVest Indies. F. E. M. Hercules, who has also been touring the West Indies, has addressed the Universal Negro Improvement Association in New York on the right of the negro race to self-determination. He is a managing director of the African League, an active member of the Ogboni Society and ex-editor of the London African Telegraph, the organ of the African Co-operative Corporation. This body has property on the West Coast of Africa, and offices both in the United States and in London. It is attempting to arouse American and West Indian interest in its activities. One meeting in New York was addressed by a Londoner, Stanley Donovan Robertson of Lambeth. On the London Board of Directors are the negroes M. C. Thompson, Norwich House, Holborn; J. E. Taylor, Lincoln House, High Holborn; and a Birmingham, manufacturer, E. A. Jackson.The Crisis, the anglophobe organ of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured,People, contains an (article by Du Bois on race pride. He finds that in the past both Tory and Liberal England has sinned against her dependent peoples and he anticipates that Labour England may very possibly continue the story. He advocates independence for Ireland, India and Egypt and Home Rule for the negro parts of the Empire, failing which the world must once again face &quot; the tyranny which looms as portentous as the God-defying dreams of Germany and which portends even greater bitterness.&apos;&apos;White anti-Britishers are using the Post Office for hostile pro-paganda. Postal packages and letters have been found labelled &quot; Buy nothing that is made in England.&quot; The labels had apparently been attached surreptitiously.The Hearst press has Been fit to express its approval of the British decision to ship gold to the United States in order to retire the Anglo-French bonds which mature in October next. This praise may only be intended to give an appearance of impartiality and thus to pave the way for the next violent attack on Great Britain, and may thus be merely a proof of recognition of the principle of dramatic alternatives.   It is interesting to note that the Canadian paper
the Toronto Globe, has urged the Canadian Parliament to bar the mails to the publications of Hearst on the grounds that he &quot; is deliberately inciting his dupes to declare a war upon our country and flag.&quot;The sympathy given to the affairs of Ireland is too well known from comments in the English press to need fuller reference here, though it is worth noting that in Chicago Judge Kavanagh, in granting naturalization papers to an Irishman, has made the man forswear not only his allegiance to the English throne, but also his allegiance to de Valera and the Irish Republic. This is the first record of the dual oath having been administered.Turning from the Irish-American to the German-American, the only thing to note is that a report has been received which shows that the United Lutheran Church in America has received funds from Germany in order to send American and German-American missionaries to vxrious parts of the world, more especially India.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. Mexico.Linn A. E. Gale, the Industrial Workers of the World leader, has been violently taken to task by Irwin Granich of Mexico City in the &quot; One Big Union Monthly.&quot; Granich attacks Gale as a dangerous nonenity, not above turning spy for his own profit.In Gale&apos;s own. magazine there is an article by John A. Jutt, his German-born colleague. Jutt writes that the Mexican administration of the Industrial Workers of the World has definitely become a working body with a Provisional Committee composed of Angel Bernal, Jos4 Yillalobos and John Jutt himself. Industrial unions are to be organized throughout Mexico and existing ones modified to conform with the Industrial Workers of the World constitution. Organizers will be drafted on the &quot;job delegate system&quot; to different works in order to carry on propaganda amongst the employees. Efforts are being made to affiliate the Railioad Brotherhood with the Industrial Workers of the World and the adhesion of the Union of Restaurant Employees of Mexico City is shortly expected. Jutt gives details of a meeting of the &quot; Casa del Obrero Mundial&quot; at which delegates of the Industrial Workers of the World were surprised by the presence of Louis M. Morones, a lieutenant of Samuel Gompers of the American Federation. of Labour. Morones seems strongly established in the Obrero Mundial organization, but Jutt thinks he may ultimately be defeated.In connection with the attempted shipment of German arms to Mexico via Holland (see January report) Mexican officers are now reported to.be in Germany buying munitions and aircraft on behalf of their Government. Among those expected to visit Europe on this errand is Colonel Salinas, chief of the Mexican Air Service and a nephew of Carranza. The intention apparently is to collect the arms on the Baltic Seas and tranship into a Norwegian vessel.From Havana comes a report that Spanish steamers outward bound for Mexico are carrying large numbers of Germans.
12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. Argentine.During January an anonymous circular was distributed in Buenos Aires and the provinces threatening a general strike and an incendiary campaign unless the law giving the Government power to deport labour agitators and undesirables without trial was repealed. The threatened general strike did not materialize, but many fires broke out in the city, and incendiary bombs, some of them containing phosphorus, others chlorofor n, oil and petroleum, were discovered. The unrest was not confined to Buenos Aires: the agricultural areas were also affected as a result of persistent anarchist propaganda with considerable loss from the tiring of rickyards. An Englishman named Angus McLeod was murdered by bandits on the 5th of January at Valle Huemules (Chubut). During the strike of the employees of the Forestal Company, a British concern, cattle were killed and houses attacked, while non-Federationists were dragged through the streets to the quarters of the Federation and compelled to sign a document declaring their voluntary participation in the strike. The strike headquarters was in Vera, Spaniards and Ru-russians being reported as the leaders. The Forestal Company employed a large number of Germans before the war and it is rumoured that German intrigue played its part. To make matters worse the police were supine, possibly with the connivance of the Sante Fe Government, in view of the elections in February.bandints which were carried out by the police in connection with a 1 supposed anarchist plot in March met with a certain amount of armed resistance. Many arrests were made and quantities of bombs and other explosives were seized. The Government probably acted on the supposition that the Anarchists, encouraged by the indica-tions of discontent in the police force of the capital, had decided to take immediate action and were counting on a general strike arising out of the then strikes of chauffeurs, sailors and dock hands.Improved conditions and large increase of wages are demanded by the Railway Unions. The great Southern Central Argentine and Cordoba Central Railways are affected. The demand of the &apos; Federation Obreros Maritimos that pay should be raised to 7 dollars a day had the support of the Government, presumably for political ends, since the Government itself is said to pay its own employees much worse than the shipping companies The latter have been compelled to accede to the extra rate by a Government threat to take over the work.Public opinion in the Argentine has been much impressed by the vote given by British trades unions against direct action.   It is [   quite possible that the decision, which is hailed as an example of commonsense patriotism, may help to re-establish the rate of exchange.Brazil.Masonic Lodges, both in the Argentine and in Brazil, are reported \ to be used for propaganda purposes. Free Masonry in Brazil i especially is said to be a cover for nefarious political activities. A I   meeting of the Workmen&apos;s Federation held in Rio de Janeiro on the
23rd of March decided to proclaim a general strike at midnight unless the claims of the Leopoldiuo railwaymen, who came out on the 15th of March, were satisfied. The Great Western railway employees are also on strike.   Both Companies are British concerns.The strike was partially successful and by the 26th of March many workmen had answered the call, including the strikers of the Brazilian Lloyd Line, textile workers and hotel waiters. Disturb-ances occurred and a number of arrests were made. The Government, which was supported by the better class newspapers, took serious measures and expelled a number of foreign anarchists who were active among the workers.The Leopoldina railway employees, who were the cause of the trouble, were the first to return to work and are said now to remain at their posts. The men on the San Paulo Eailway are reported to have followed suit.Chile.The Bill of Amnesty in respect of the abortive military revolution led by ex-Fernandez Vial last May will probably be carried. If so, the judicial proceedings against Generals and other officers concerned will be dropped, an ending to the affair which will be generally approved.A large contingent of German emigrants is expected during May. They will be carried on German ships.Guatemala.A revolution broke out on the 9th of April. President Cabrera capitulated after General Herrera had enveloped La Palma. General Herrera now heads the new Government. American marines were landed.Peru.The Governments proposed Confiscation Law (see January report) has met with strong opposition from Dr. Porras, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr. Lansing, the late United States Foreign Secretary. The Bill, which was directed against conspiracy and sub-versive movements which have been making the Government anxious, will probably be. dropped. It contains two main provisions, one empowering the Executive to denounce conspirators against the. public welfare, whose property can be seized and the man expatriated, the other annulling all contracts which may have been entered into with conspirators since the 4th July last. To this clause, which would affect American traders, Mr. Lansing took particular exception.PART II. The Situation in the Ukraine.A traveller who left Kieff early in January and crossed the Ukraine, partly on foot and partly in peasants&apos; carts, depicts it as split up into a number of small republics consisting, sometimes of a single village, at other times of two, three, five, ten or twenty villages united in a tiny State. In all these republics the entire population is armed to the teeth with rifles, revolvers and very often with machine guns, field guns and even armoured cars. There is no lack of ammunition or of fortification with trenches and barbed wire.  As
every male has served in the army, the quality of the armed force at the disposal of the villages is by no means despicable.The tiny republics are governed by the local communal authorities. These are not to be mistaken for Soviets of any kind. They are simply the authorities which existed in pro-revolution times. Agreements of all kinds, including defensive and offensive alliances, mainly directed against the towns, often exist between two, or a number, of these rural commonwealths. To a particular commonwealth or group may be assigned the right to plunder a town in its vicinity at a time fixed by treaty. These agreements are for the most part faithfully observed both in letter and spirit.it is a war of the rural districts against the towns. No towns-man, unless he promises to reside and make common cause with one of the republics, dares to venture into the villages. People in Kieff are convinced that it was not the regular Bolshevik forces that chased Lfenikin out of the Ukraine, but rather those peasant republics which succeeded in completely disorganising his rear.The situation of the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine is no happier than was that of Denikin. Their advance is strictly limited to the railway lines; no Bolshevik can venture ten miles outside a railway station. Bolshevik propaganda has no charms for the Ukrainian peasant. He acquired the land of the big proprietors without the help of the Bolsheviks. He possesses and tills it. Socialisation is the last thing he would dream of. He will not be governed by the Jews; and almost all the Bolsheviks are Jews. They came into the Ukraine with practically the same programme as Denikin : to force the peasant to give up his wheat, his cattle and his rye. They can offer in exchange nothing but their paper money, which will buy nothing.The key of the situation is the firm will of the population to take the defence of their lives and belongings into their own hands. Every army that attempted to invade the Ukraine endeavoured in the first place to requisition and recruit. The peasants have no use for either. They want somebody to guarantee them the possession of the land, security and order. This no outsider has been able to do. They have taken the task upon themselves.The Bolsheviks may have a railway base at Odessa, but, as the railway network in the U kraine is very sparse, there presence there can, in the present temper of the population, only be ephemeral. It is confined to a few cities really governed by municipal councils, whose tolerance for the Bolsheviks is only temporary. Communi-cation between the cities is uncertain. They are boycotted by the rural districts, which refuse to supply them with food, and are rapidly becoming depopulated, the townspeople drifting to the village communities where they find food and an easy subsistence.The Ukraine abounds in cereals of. all kinds. Last year&apos;s crops were rich without precedent. There is a plethora of cattle, horses and pigs. None of these have been exported during the last two years. It is believed that about one-half of the stock of sugar, as estimated in 1918, is still in the country. As is known, over 80 per cent, of the total Eussian production of sugar came from the Ukraine.The Germans were the last to draw upon the Ukrainian stocks, but the quantity they took was comparatively small nd many stocks remain untouched.   One and a half years have elapsed since
they left. The majority of the rural districts have been relatively tranquil during this time, and the land has been regularly tilled. This applies not only to the peasant land, but also to the land of the big proprietors taken over by the peasants, who have maintained in force what is known as General Eichhorn&apos;s law, that is, every peasant has a right to as much of the big proprietors&apos; land as he can work- with his family, the surplus going to others who stand in need.From all reports it would appear that the Ukraine is the part of Russia from which Europe could get most food. The orderliness of the rural districts and the fact that the inhabitants showed hospitality to the traveller, and even requested him to stay with them as a sort of expert politician, seems to show that European intervention of the right sort might not be unwelcome to them.Mr. George Lansbury on the Foreign Policy of theSoviet Government.The following statements made by Mr. George Lansbury in Sweden on his return through that country from Russia in the middle of March afford an interesting glimpse into the realities of Bolshevik policy.Mr. Lansbury stated that the Bolshevik Government were dis-posed to make enormous territorial and economic concessions, but that they would never allow outside interference in Russian internal affairs.The demobilisation of the Bolshevik Army is dependent on demobilisation in the neighbouring States. The Soviet Government demand a more effective demobilisation of both the German and - Allied Armies.Mr. Lansbury affirmed that he had managed to convince Lenin and Tchitcherin of the necessity of making concessions to Finland, as the n actionary party in that country would only be satisfied with territorial concessions. He further stated that Soviet Russia manifests the greatest contempt for Finland, but that nevertheless he &quot;-as instructed to inform the Finnish Government that (1) Russia is willing to give territorial compensation, (2) to renounce indemnities in exchange for goods belonging to the Russian Government and which are now in Finland, (3) to guarantee non-interference in Finland&apos;s internal affairs, (4) to cease all propaganda in Finland.Lansbury communicated the above to Holsti, but the latter admitted that it would be difficult to persuade the new Cabinet to make peace.As regards Poland, the Soviets consider Poland&apos;s demands as quite inacceptable and from a military point of view they are ready not only to repel the attacks but to take the offensive.Lansbury considers that: 1. The internal economic, industrial and financial position of Russia is so serious that the Bolsheviks are prepared to buy peace at any price.2. Lenin no longer believes in the almighty power of the world&apos;s social revolutions, but thinks that social and economic revolts are inevitable in Europe, and if conditions are favourable these revolts may alter their local character.
3. The present task of the Soviet Government, as well as of the Third International, consists in feeding the revolutionary flames in Europe, as their existence is only based on the masses retaining their revolutionary spirit. 4. The Eastern Proletariat is to continue making peace with Russia. Lansbury visited Prince Kropotkiu, the great Russian libertaire and socialist.   He says Krppotkin disapproves of the Bolsheviks and is becoming more conservative with age.Notes.The obvious deduction from paragraph 3 in Mr. Lansbury&apos;s statement is that a Peace by the Soviet Government with Germany and the Entente is only a false guarantee.The text of paragraph 4 is obscure, but apparently relates to the Soviet Governments Eastern propaganda. Mr. Lansbury evidently did not know of the closing of the Moscow Bureau for Moslem propaganda (vide part II, p. 52 of this issue), It is probable that the Soviet Government intends to present the cessation of this Branch of Propaganda to the British as a great concession and is meanwhile keeping it secret.Central Bureau of the Moslem Organizations of the Russian Communist Party.This organization was established in Moscow early in 1919. Its purpose was to serve as a Central Propaganda Bureau for Oriental Peoples, and to &quot;join those long-suffering nations to the oppressed family of the whole world&quot; under the reign of Communism. In furtherance of this aim it projected &quot; immediate union and combined action against British rule by all Asiatic peoples.&quot; Certain of its manifestations in our possession make it clear that the Bureau dealt with the East as a whole and styled itself &quot;Moslem&quot; only by reason of its proximate objectives and because it regarded Oriental peoples as mostly Mohammedan. In fact, however, it trained as propagan-dists Hindus, Buddhists and Chinese Bonzes, as well as Persians, Afghans and Azerbaijanis. Courses were conducted in English, French, Chinese, Hindustani and Thibetan.The Central Bureau in Moscow is reported to have been run at one time with the assistance of eight German officers and to have been singularly unapproachable to outsiders. It was largely increased in the autumn of 1919, when hundreds of persons were reported to be undergoing its course of Bolshevik propaganda. Among its projects, when the time for them should be ripe, were a union between the Mussulman armies of the Trans-Caspian Provinces, Azerbaijan, Persia and Turkey, and the formation of a Tartar-Bashkir Republic. It is reported to have contributed funds without much result to organizations in the Crimea, which had as their object the union of Moslems for political intrigue, and to have established a network of similar organizations in Persia. Its propaganda, in view of the peoples to whom it was addressed, could not avoid being largely religious and national, and to the inherent contradiction between the concepts of Communism and the ideas of religion and nationality its comparative ineffectiveness, despite the most persistent and ingenious efforts, is probably due.
The Moslem Bureau was closed in February or early March 1920, when Mr. George Lansbury, who expressed his surprise afc the soviet&apos;s amazing ignorance as regards Indian affairs, was informed of its closing by Lenin. We have since had confirmation from an unim-peachable source that the Bureau and its activities have in fact come to an end, either, as Lenin said to Mr. Lansbury, by reason of the lift ng of the Blockade, or because the living water of Communism and the oil of Oriental tradition refused to mix.The Communists trust to keep this secret from the British Government in the hope of being able to offer it as a concession.Economic Reconstruction in Soviet Russia, The Labour Armies.The principles with regard to the organization of labour advanced by the Central Executive Committee of the Russian Communist Party at its Congress, and circulated by wireless on the 9th of March, show the unabashed adoption by the Soviet Government of the idea of the Servile State.Shortly, their economic doctrine is as follows: Every social regime, whether it be serfdom, slavery or capital, has had its own methods of labour coercion and education in the interests of the exploiting upper class. Following these the Soviet regime must develop its own procedure to intensify labour on the basis of social economy and the interests of the toiling masses.To this end all skilled workers must be mobilised, registered and given their proper employment. If now doing inexpert work they must be got back to their own, kept to it, and released from it only by special authority. In the words of Radek &quot; Soviet Russia will only be in a position to organize her industry when she has at her disposal every one of her qualified workers, and when she knows how to distribute all the qualified and unskilled labour forces in conformity with the economic needs of the country and in compliance with the general economic scheme.&quot;The Soviet authorities recognise, however, that an illusion still exists among the labouring masses that there is such a thing as freedom of labour. When the town is starving unregenerate individuals can escape to the villages or may start profiteering, and so criminally obtain food for themselves or possibly even become rich. Enthusiasm for the Communist cause, propaganda, and, so far as it is compatible with communist ideas, the influence of competition must be made use of in order to encourage production under the organized scheme. The advanced section of the Proletariat is therefore urged to lead the way, and assured that the rest will follow. A nucleus of communists is made compulsory for every labour detachment, and labour is to be varied with &quot; sound&quot; instruc-tion. Together with the influence of propaganda and moral influence on the toiling masses, together with repression applied to idlers, parasites and disorganizes, competition between factories, districts, unions, workshops and individual workers must be organized. A system of rewards must be instituted in close relation to the system of food supply. It is not meet, while the Soviet Republic is short of food, that conscientious and diligent workers should not be better provided for than the idlers.
Meanwhile workers are assured that the present centralised system of industrial organization is transitional. The proletarian state carried on the process of capitalist trusts by further uniting enterprises of the same branch of industry formerly not united by those trusts. Russian Soviet industry thus became a number of powerful unions isolated from each other and united only by the Soviet of National Economy. Presently the endeavour will be to pass from the centralisation of trusts to the socialisation of that centralisation. Centralisation, temporarily necessary under Soviet ideals in order to bring capitalist concerns under proletarian control, proves, in practice, to be cumbersome, if not impossible, because it sacrifices the immediate contact with local markets, material and labour, by which decentralised industry profited. The size of the country, the changeability of the chief factors of production, disorganized transport, bad communications, lack of method, the results of economic registration and the methods of centralisation which followed the first phase of the expropriation of Bourgeois industry have inevitably led to the isolation of enterprises in the towns, provinces and districts, and resulted in disastrous delays. It all meant in fact the bankruptcy of the system.As regards the remedy, there appear to be two distinct parties in Soviet Russia ; one favours reconstruction by centralisation, the other by decentralisation. The former party, which is said to include Lenin, Trotsky, Rikow and the majority of Peopled Commissaries, proposes to handle the industrial question through the mobilisation of working forces, using the present military organization as a basis. Indeed, conversations with Krassin give the impression that the Soviet leaders were afraid to demobilise the soldiers lest they should refuse to assist in the reconstruction of Russia. The other party favours the grant of a greater latitude to local trade unions, small land grants, no immediate development of agricultural communes and a certain amount of autonomy for co-operative societies. The members of this party are said to consist mainly of provincial delegates who want more power vested in local Soviets.The Soviet authorities&apos; solution, for what it may be worth, lies in co-ordinating devolution and centralisation. The central authority will be maintained, together with a subordination of enterprises to industrial districts, where enterprises of various branches are obliged to obtain raw material, means of transport, and working hands from the same local sources. The interest of the local population in the results of local industrial activities must be aroused. Special local Bureaux with wide powers will organize regions so far removed from Moscow as Siberia, Turkestan, the Caucasus, the Ukraine and the country of the Don. To special Commissions will be entrusted the almost certainly impossible task of allotting powers to the local economic organizations which shall not bring them into conflict with the Central Economic authorities.Economic life is in fact being militarised. Military power remains in Trotsky&apos;s hands, and the orders and decrees of the council of defence speak of &quot; a new front,&quot; while Bolshevik poets sound the praises of the Red G-uard who have turned their hands to the plough. The present reorganization of labour on a military basis is believed to be due to the fact that nobody can be found with sufficient ability to reorganize
industry and traffic and that the only method of carrying this out was by using the well-disciplined organizations, which had been built up by Trotsky and had acted so efficiently under his direction. But these organizations are now demoralised and men of the labour army work with incredible slowness and unwillingness.Meanwhile, under the new system, many of the railway shops are working a 12-hour shift, while others are working on a three-shift basis.   Russian official newspapers of the 7th of March announce the establishment of a 10-hour day in the factories of certain districts. The nationalized industries are offering their goods to the State at such high prices that the Government is unable to pay them. The Soviet authorities are having difficulty in enforcing labour conscription.   Before the revolution the attendance of workmen at factories is said to have averaged about 90 per cent.   Only half that number now report.   In some factories, indeed, where a leader or manager is efficient and does not give in to every wish of the work-men, results have been good.   In a large number of cases, however there is great discontent and a demand for higher wages.   Many workmen are beginning to understand that the terror against factory managers, technical engineers and other responsible -individuals cannot continue, while Lenin, at a recent meeting at Moscow, said it was necessary to make use of the services of the bourgeois experts and that the creation of an invincible labour party was only possible with their assistance.The following Workmen Armies have been formed: 1. The Ukrainian, to work in the Donetz Basin. 2. The Siberian, for mining work in Siberia. 3. The Petrograd, to construct a new model city out of the former capital.4. The Beserve, to assist the others as required.The Soviet has shown great caution in forming these armies, which are each to consist of about 25,000 proved Communists and 75,000 other workmen. Skilled labour is only to be put to skilled work. The railwaymen leaving their work without permission are to be punished as deserters.It is not astonishing to hear that certain members of the Soviet Government of the type of Krassin look more than sceptically on these plans. First, they consider the arrangements tend to depart more and more from the original Bolshevik programme. Secondly, and more powerfully, they argue that in Russia, where labour has always been more or less compulsory with no satisfactory results, the ostensible change is merely a return to ancient proctices.Leonid Borissovitch Krassin.- A sketch of the characteristics and career of the Chief of.the Co-operative Delegation from Soviet Russia may be of interest on the eve of its arrival.Leonid Borissovitch Krassin is a Siberian by birth. Born in 1870, of good bourgeois stock, his career in the Technological Institute of Petrograd, when he was working for a degree in science, was cut short by his expulsion for taking part in a students&apos; uprising.Between 1892 and 1907 his career is one of steady advancement .in his profession of electrical engineer, and varied plottings against
and banishments by the Czar&apos;s Government. Wherever he went he continued to organize conspiracy. At this time, while at heart what would now be called a Moderate Socialist, he regarded revolutionary anarchy as a necessary preliminary to the establishment of Russian liberty. In 1907 he was arrested in Viborg on some revolutionary enterprise, but succeeded in escaping to Berlin, where his intimate friend, Oulmau, was a director of the &quot; Siemens &amp; Schuckert&quot; firm of electrical engineers. In Berlin his name was mentioned in connection with the discovery by the police of a revolutionary depot with bombs, dynamite and paper prepared for forging Russian 3-rouble notes.Krassin obtained work with the firm of &quot; Siemens &amp; Schuckert,&quot; whose directors had great inlluence at the Russian Court and in high quarters of the Russian bureaucracy. This influence was brought to bear in his favour, and in 1909 Russia granted Krassin a free pardon and he returned to Petrograd, where he soon became one of the active directors of the &quot; Allgemeine Elektricitats-gesellschaft,&quot; a branch of the &quot; Siemens &amp; Schuckert&quot; firm in Petrograd, which was financed by the &quot; Deutsche Bank.&quot; Krassin held this directorship till August 1918, when he was appointed to an official position in the Soviet Government.Immediately after the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917, Lenin offered Krassin a ministry in the new Government. Krassin declined. Lenin&apos;s adventure seemed too bold, his theories of reconstruction too sweeping. The new rigime seemed unstable. Krassin refused to compromise his now excellent position. He kept in with the new Government, however, and his relations with Lenin were not affected. Presumably as a persona grata to Germany, he accompanied Lenin and Trotsky to Brest-Litovsk. When it appeared that the new Government would last he threw in his fortunes with it and became Commissary of Pood in the Red Army, in which task he immediately enlisted the aid of his German friends.He joined the new Government without conviction, and was obviously insincere in his defence of its economic policy. He was one of the masters who perceived that, for the time at least, nothing was to be gained by resisting the control of the workers. Others, who sacrificed their influence over the workers&apos; committees of management, only gave improvidence the upper hand and had to close down. By an understanding with his workers Krassin saved his factory, so benefiting both in his continued influence with the men, and by the generous subsidies in money, in facilities for trans-port and in raw materials, accorded by the new rigime to factories where the chefs d&apos;industrie remained at their post under a Communist mask.Krassin was at heart a resolute adversary of the Communist experiments as worked out by the Bolsheviks, and considered the nationalisation of commerce the stupidest of all Lenin&apos;s performances. When Minister of Commerce and Industry, he was writing privately to his friends condemning the system which made it impossible to buy a pencil without applying to half-a-dozen offices, or to find a yard of cloth while the Government storehouses were full of it.Krassin&apos;s policy in all the Ministries he has occupied, and they are now four in number, is gently and if possible imperceptibly, for
fear of rousing the opposition of the extremists, to insinuate the plain old bourgeois modes of dealing. As Commissary of the People for Ways and Communications he attempted, for the time without success, to reorganise the railways, then managed by a swarm of workmen&apos;s councils, on larger lines. Certain of his circulars at that period read as if he were simply reacting to the Czarist system of railway management, and he is the inspirer of Lenin&apos;s appeals to the discipline of the workers.He has elaborated all sorts of schemes in conjunction with cosmopolitan financiers, proposing concessions on the pretext that Socialism can only survive by the aid of foreign capital.As regards the world revolution he is an entire sceptic and a protagonist of a bourgeois peace. The Germans, who know this, thought he was their man, and tried hard to get him as Soviet representative in Berlin.Krassin&apos;s real desire is gradually to lead Bolshevism into the ways of normal democracy. What restrains him from embarking openly on such a policy or from publicly avowing, what he knows perfectly well to be true, that the existing. Soviet rtgime is the antithesis of genuine communism, is his fear of the extremists. Indeed, his contempt for the official creed has been visibly modified since Peters, the famous organizer of the Terror, imprisoned him, along with Lenin, for a few hours.The Bolshevik regime and the Russian Peasantry.According to the report of one of the members of the German Commission which has recently returned from Soviet Russia, the power of the Bolsheviks is limited to a definite zone round the large cities, which they search for requisitions or recruits for the Red Armies. Even within this zone the Bolshevik authorities meet with a good deal of resistance; outside it they have no power at all. That the peasants are not imbued with the Bolshevik spirit is proved by their often trying to get into touch with the former landowners and suggesting that these should transfer the stolen land to them by deed. In some instances they are even willing to pay for it, since by this means their conscience is cleared and they have a legal document to show in the event of anyone coming to take the land away from them again.The peasants follow Communistic principles only as far as the possession of the land is concerned. They are entirely self-supporting and often avoid both taxation and military service. They consider it their right to keep what they now hold and to cultivate enough to supply their own needs. They have no encouragement to do more, because any surplus is immediately requisitioned by theSoviet authorities.In the country districts, in short, the Central Administration of Soviet Russia has disappeared and distant villages are left entirely to themselves. The peasants are anxious for trade to begin again. They do not care with whom, or what political party brings it about, so long as the land is left to them and they are not forced to pay taxes.His Majesty&apos;s Stationery official,
