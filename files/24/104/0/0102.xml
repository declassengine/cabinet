Circulated by Secretary of State for India.SECRET.General Malleson&apos;s Force at Meshed.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India, dated 23rd April.In view of the memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, I wish to explain the position of my Office in the matter.In pursuance of what were understood to be the orders of the Finance Committee of the Cabinet, a telegram was sent to the Government of India (with the approval of Mr. Fisher, in my absence) on 10th February informing them that the Cabinet were of opinion that all troops should be withdrawn from East Persia. At the same time they were asked for their observations, but it was explained that if the troops were retained for Indian reasons, the whole cost would probably be thrown on India. The Government of India replied on 21st February in favour of withdrawal of the force as such, but my Office, which had agreed with the Foreign Office in strongly deprecating withdrawal, on military and political grounds, were not convinced by their arguments, and approached Lord Curzon with a view to submitting the question again to the Cabinet. Lord Curzon asked that a memorandum should be prepared for his approval, and this necessitated further reference to India to clear up some financial points. Finally, as Lord Curzon was not satisfied with the financial proposals made in India&apos;s behalf, he summoned a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Conference on Eastern Affairs to discuss the whole question on 17th March. At this meeting Lord Curzon said that &quot;it would assist him very much in putting the case before the Cabinet if he could say that the Government of India were interested to the extent of 50 per cent.&quot; A telegram had, in fact, been sent to the Government of India on 15th March asking them what was the maximum reduction in cost which they could effect and to what extent were they prepared to face it. Their answer, dated 19th March, was felt to make it impossible for the India Office to approach the Cabinet again, and official letters were accordingly sent to the Foreign Office and War Office on 26th March asking if they concurred that orders should be issued for the immediate commencement of withdrawal. The War Office concurred, but the Foreign Office on 3rd April stated that Lord Curzon could not concur; but wished the matter to be discussed again by the Inter-Departmental Conference. A meeting was therefore held on the eve of Lord Curzon&apos;s departure for San Remo, as the result of which the letters printed below were exchanged between him and me. On receipt of his, I explained the position to Mr. Bonar Law, who decided that no action should be taken until Lord Curzon returned from San Remo and could put the case before the Cabinet himself.The Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P., to the Right Hon. the Earl curzon of Kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.India Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1, My dear Curzon, April 14, 1920.Since the meeting yesterday, I have referred to the Minutes of the Finance Committee of the Cabinet of the 9th February. They are quite explicit and clear, and there appears to be nothing contrary to them in the Cabinet Minutes of the 11th February. In accordance with them the India Office telegram announced the decision, while leaving the door open for the Government of India to object, if they chose.The present position, therefore, is that the Cabinet ordered withdrawal on 9th February; that on the strength of that order the War Office have made no further provision in their estimates for the cost of retaining the force; that the Government of India (with whom I agree) are unwilling to bear it; and that the force has not, in fact, been withdrawn. I think you will agree that this is a position that must be regularised at once, and the only way I see of regularising it, consistently with the views I hold, is to order the withdrawal to be begun at once  it will take five months and this I propose to do, unless you are prepared to take full responsibility (financial and other) for further delay in giving effect to the decision of the Cabinet. *
I have considered very carefully the possibility of merely reducing the force, as you suggested. But this has been proposed to the Government of India, who maintain that neither from the military nor from the political point of view is its retention an Indian interest. I have told the Foreign Office repeatedly that I find it increasingly difficult to persuade my Council to sanction the expenditure of Indian revenues in Persia: it will be impossible for me to do so when the Government of India themselves disclaim interest in it.You referred to military expenditure before the war, and it is quite true that India paid half the cost of the Consular guards and half the cost of the troops sent to Shiraz in 1911. But these troops were not engaged in military operations. Had they been, it would have been necessary for us, under the Government of India Act, to obtain the consent of Parliament. That, I submit, is what differentiates the present case from pre-war precedents. The point is, in fact, under discussion with the Treasury now as regards the cost of Malleson&apos;s force since it withdrew7 from Transcaspia in April, 1919. The general consent of Parliament to the expenditure of Indian revenues during the war on military operations outside India was obtained by the resolutions of 1914, but Indian liability was limited to the so-called normal cost.&quot; We accordingly maintain and I think it is incontrovertible that the Government of India is debarred by Statute from bearing any part of the cost of Malleson&apos;s military force beyond the &quot; normal cost &quot; : the political expenditure we are prepared to halve. You may like to refer in this connection to India Office letter F. 3044, dated 27th July, 1916, to the Treasury (copy enclosed).The Government of India&apos;s recommendation, in which I hope that you, on further consideration, will concur, is as follows: The retention of the Consular escort, one and a half cavalry squadrons at Meshed and half squadron at Seistan, some light armoured cars at Meshed and possibly Ford van transport. Persia to take over Khorasan levies in present strength and Seistan levies in reduced strength, both under British officers; small regular mobile detach -ment at Duzdap; reduced garrison at Khwas and maintenance of present tribal and levy payments in Sarhad. . Of foregoing cost of Consular escort at Meshed and Seistan, including all contingent charges, will be borne half and half by His Majesty&apos;s Government and India, cost of Khorasan and Seistan levies with their officers by Persia. Conditionally on these arrangements we are prepared to meet the cost of Duzdap and Khwas detachments, and payments for this redistribution of cost might have effect when withdrawal of the forces is complete.The cost of the enlarged Consular escorts, being political, will be equally shared with the Foreign Office; that of the Khorasan and Seistan levies (which is at present being entirely borne by British revenues, except as regards the &quot; normal cost &quot; of the Indian personnel) will be taken over by the Persian Government. I am doubtful whether the cost of the detachments at Duzdap and Khwas can be brought within the spirit of the Resolutions. If I am able, on further enquiry, to satisfy myself that I can, I am willing to ask my Council to bear it.Yours sincerely,E. S. Montagu.The Right Hon. the Earl Curzon of Kedleston, KG., G.G.S.I., G.C.I.E., to the Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P.Dear Montagu, Foreign Office, S.W.1, loth April, 1920.As I am leaving England in a few hours, I cannot refer to a Cabinet, as I should otherwise certainly do, the question that you have raised about Khorasan.The decision of the Cabinet to which you refer was recorded by the Prime Minister after I had left the roomanddid not represent the facts as I had heard them. I was not present on the second occasion. If you order the withdrawal of the force from Khorasan you must accept the full responsibility for any consequences that may occur in that quarter.   I can accept none.When I alluded to military expenditure in Persia before the war I was not referring to Shiraz but to the cost of frontier levies. Nor can I admit that Malleson&apos;s men are now engaged in military operations. Since they retired from Transcaspia they have not fired a shot.If India disinterests herself in East Persia (to which she and not we insisted on &quot;despatching MallesonV Mission) the Foreign Office will feel no disposition to recognise, as they have hitherto done, the predominant interest of India in these regions.&apos; Yours sincerely,Cuezon.
APPENDIX.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department,10th February 1920.My telegram of 4th February, 428. Eastern Military Policy. Cabinet have bad under consideration the military position in South and East Persia. They are of opinion that all troops in these areas should be recalled. This would involve total withdrawal of Malleson not merely to Birjand but altogether and also of all troops on his lines of communication in Persia.Grounds of Cabinet view are that cost is altogether too excessive, see your telegram, Finance 1801 C.W.C. of 30th December, in view of the fact that Malleson wTould be quite unable to resist any serious atack in force. Have you any observa-tions ? If you consider the retention of a force anywhere in Eastern Persia essential in view of the Afghan situation or other Indian political interests, please make recommendations, but you must understand that if troops are retained on any such grounds, question will be treated as purely an Indian one, and the whole cost probably thrown on India.Telegram from Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State forIndia, 21st February 1920.[Repeated to Teheran and Meshed.)(Received 23rd.)204 S. We have considered in Council your telegram, Army Department, of 10th February, regarding military position in South and East Persia. In South we desire earliest possible withdrawal.2. East Persia. General Officer Commanding, Quetta Division, estimates that withdrawal will take five months to complete as length of route and lack of water necessitate withdrawal in small echelons. If it began in March when snow has melted, it might thus not be complete until August.3. Khorasan. From purely military standpoint dangers to be apprehended to Khorasan are either Bolshevik attack in force or Afghan attack. As you point out, Malleson&apos;s force could not resist serious Bolshevik attack, and though its withdrawal as far as Birjand only would enable it to remain menace to Bolsheviks, its mainten-ance there would become excessively inconvenient, as it would be deprived of local supplies now obtainable round Meshed. Regarding Afghan attack on Khorasan, this, if it were to constitute casus belli between British Government and Afghanistan, could be best met by attacking Afghanistan from side of India, although immediate power to ward off Afghan attacks on Persian side would be lessened by withdrawal. Malleson considers main military value of present position at Meshed is as outpost bridge over Central Asia. Maintenance of our present military intelligence system could be secured by leaving Military Attache in Khorasan with small escort to Consulate and two or three British officers. Thus, so far as militarv considerations are concerned, withdrawal is unobjectionable.4. From political standpoint we offer following observations: (1) Although we recognise that Anglo-Persian agreement does not technically commit British Govern-ment to defence of present Persian regime, public opinion in the East almost certainly hold that His Majesty&apos;s Government are morally committed, as was foretold in our telegram of 480 S., dated 24th April 1919. Bolsheviks may not contemplate early military attack on Persia, but there is undoubtedly in Persian eyes distinct threat of such attack, and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to withdraw all forces in the face of this threat, may expose them to charges of breach of faith, and react on position not only in Persia but in Afghanistan, making our relations wdth latter more difficult. While pointing this out we do not wish to base any recommendation on it, since main-tenance of British reputation in Persia is not mainly Indian interest and effect on our relations with Afghanistan, though possibly important, can only be indirect. (2) More imminent and real danger is that Bolsheviks, while abstaining from military attack, will flood Khorasan with emissaries and propagandas, with object of causing armed risings against local Persian Administration which they represent to be under British domination. This danger has so far been averted by presence of British forces at Khorasan, though Malleson now reports signs of fraternisation of Persian Customs officials and gendarmerie with Bolsheviks. Rebellion of Khorasan at Bolshevik instigation would probably affect the British position at Teheran, reacting
on Afghanistan almost as much as Bolshevik military attack. We believe that danger of such risings would be lessened if fairly strong escorts were left for Meshed Gonsu-late, and if Khorasan levies were to remain under British officers, but to be paid for by Persian Government, (? and if so) incorporated in new uniform force. There would of course be danger that levies might become infected with Bolshevism, and attack their British officers, but if we are to make any attempt to put drags on Bolshevising of Khorasan, we fear this risk must be faced. This measure, coupled with fact that withdrawal of British regular forces cannot be complete till August, may tide over dangerous period of next spring and summer.5. Tract between Birjand,and Duzdap. There are 1,750 Seistan levies under British officers in this tract. Many of them former noted raiders and their sudden disbandment would encourage Afghan raiding on British trade caravans and produce disorder in country. Consul at Seistan recommends retention of fairly strong Seistan Consular cavalry escort and gradual disbandment of such of Seistan levies (corrupt group) as cannot be absorbed into new uniform force payable by Persia. We propose to retain small mobile detachment at Duzdap to protect the railhead and dumps of goods there.6. Sarhad and (corrupt group) Baluchistan Sarhad tribes are kept in order by small garrison at Khwas^ and by tribal subsidies and Sarhad levy payments. Khwas Garrison also dominates Bampur and its withdrawal without substitution of Persian authority which does not exist might encourage Bahrain Khan to repeat his raid upon British cantonment. We wish for the present to maintain reduced regular Garrison at Khwas and continue tribal subsidies and levy payments.7. Exact wording of the summary. We recommend the retention of the Consular escort, one^-and-a-half Cavalry Squadrons at Meshed and half Squadron at Seistan, some light armoured cars at Meshed&apos; and possibly Ford van transport. Persia to-take over Khorasan levies in present strength and Seistan levies in reduced strength, both under British officers; small regular mobile detachment at Duzdap; reduced garrison at Khwas and maintenance of present tribal and levy payments in Sarhad. Of foregoing, cost of Consular escort at Meshed and Seistan including all contingent charges will be borne half and half by His Majesty&apos;s Government and India, cost of Khorasan and Seistan levies with their officers by Persia. Conditionally on these arrangements we are prepared to meet the cost of Duzdap and Khwas detachments, and payments for this redistribution of cost might have effect when withdrawal of the forces is complete.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department.Dated 15th March,1920.999. Your telegram of 21st February 204 S. Malleson&apos;s force. We regard with grave misgiving reduction to the extent you contemplate, which will be inter-preted by all parties as equivalent to withdrawal, and therefore will have all the evil consequences of withdrawal. Evidence from all sources seems to indicate that if existing situation can be maintained a little longer Bolshevik Afghan relations are likely to be strained to breaking-point. On the other hand, the Cabinet evidently regard the present cost as prohibitive, and unless it can be substantially reduced their decision, which still holds the field, will certainly be maintained.I suggest that as policy in event of organised Bolshevik attack on Persia is for our military forces not to involve themselves, Malleson&apos;s force might still play its role if it were again reduced to size prior to recent reinforcements or even below it. Similarly, might not strength on line of communications be considerably reduced ? If this is so, what is maximum reduction in cost that you can effect, and to what extent are you prepared to share it in view of your interest in maintaining stable situation in Persia and Afghanistan ?Please reply with least possible delay.   Clear the line, as matter is most urgent.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to the Secretary of State for India.Dated lWi March 1920.3721. Your telegram of the 15th instant.East Persia. In view of your statement in previous telegram that Cabinet consider all forces should be withdrawn, we do not fully understand misgiving with which you now contemplate withdrawal, as no new factors have arisen. Nor are ire able to follow contention that if existing situation can be maintained a little* Note. Spelt Vasht on map.
longer, Bolshevik-Afghan relations are likely to be strained to breaking-point. We do not see why retention of force should accelerate rupture, but on contrary it could be argued with equal reason that our withdrawal would tend to promote friction by removing one of chief causes which at present serves to unite Bolsheviks and Afghans. We adhere to view expressed in our Foreign Department telegram No. 205 S., 21st February, that, so far as India is concerned, retention of Malleson&apos;s force is unnecessary from strictly military standpoint, since it is incapable of resisting serious Bolshevik attack. Force has maintained its position hitherto mainly by bluff, and in our opinion any half-measure such as you suggest would merely serve to invite attack and would greatly increase difficulty of withdrawal in face of opposition. We consider latter operation would be more damaging to our prestige than voluntary withdrawal now.2. In paragraph II of your telegram you suggest that force might still play its role if it were again reduced to size prior to recent reinforcements or even below. We need not emphasise the fact that role which force can play is almost entirely contingent on action taken by enemy, but even if maintained at present strength it cannot now fulfil role for which it was originally intended, namely, to prevent Bolshevik invasion of Khorasan. Most it can hope to accomplish is to intercept small parties entering Khorasan from north-east and to counteract effects of enemy propaganda within limited radius of Meshed. We consider this Could be accomplished with equal effect and less obtrusively after reduction of force to small mobile escort in support of Mission. In these circumstances retention of force at extremely exposed line of communication which, though unable to maintain itself against serious attack, is still accompanied (? very often) by the impediments inseparable from body of trooops of any size is clearly open to criticism.3. Nor is it certain that reduction in size of the force and line of communication troops would effect any material reduction in cost. Chief item in present heavy expenditure is cost of hired camel transport on difficult gap of 172 miles between the Duzdap Toi and Neh, and charges are likely to rise in the future owing to the gradual exhaustion of the sources of camel supply. In any case reduction of the forces at Meshed would not permit of any reduction of line of communication troops.4. As regards the extent to which we are prepared to share cost of the force maintained in East Persia you are aware of our present financial situation, inability to provide (? needful) fund for military expenditure and the various demands being made on us. In these circumstances we are not prepared to contribute for the purpose named in your telegram more than a moiety of the cost of the escorts and detachments mentioned in our Foreign Department telegram No. 205 S. of :21st February.5. We believe that Bolsheviks are genuinely alarmed (as recently reported by Malleson) at rumours of our intention to invade Trans-Caspia and raise Mussulman against them, and that their alarm is not simulated to furnish protest for aggression on their part. It should be realised that in such a populated country like East Persia movement of quite small bodies of troops, accompanied by large quantity of transport, gives rise to most exaggerated rumours. We have some 40,000 camels moving to and fro, on lines of communication, and we have (1 further information) that Bolsheviks have received from their spies grossly exaggerated estimates of our strength. Our reinforcements have certainly added to these estimates, and similar exaggeration of Bolshevik forces is doubtless employed by our own informers.We believe it is to this cause that Bolshevik activity on Khorasan border is mainly due, and if so, we were to inform them clearly that we have no aggressive intention and simultaneously to withdraw bulk of our force, we believe danger to Northern Persia would be reduced to that arising from Bolshevik propaganda and not from military attack. As already stated, we believe that Consular Escort at Meshed, together with the local levies, would be sufficient to cope with this aggression. It is true that Persia might regard withdrawal as sign of her abandonment to Bolsheviks, but if it had result which we anticipate making Bolsheviks desist warlike preparation on her frontier, this effect would be only transitory.6. We would again point out if it is seriously contemplated that force of size approaching present is to be maintained in Khorasan prolongation of railway to Neh would effect great saving. Cost of camels maintained over this portion has already since armistice equalled estimated capital cost of this extension, and conditions which are fatall to camels are rapidly depleting whole of camel stock of (? Western) India, reacting upon our frontier requirements and constantly forcing up hire charges in Eastertj Persia, so that maintenance of force there is continually becoming more expensive aiid may shortly prove absolutely prohibitive.[3047 \ C
