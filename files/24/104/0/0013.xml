yl/1  /-Orvf /uaTIA[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. (11525)Political Intelligence Dep, Foreign Office, ,Department.China, /005.MEMOEANDUMonTHE CHINESE OCCUPATION OF BARGA (HULUNBUIR).AS foreshadowed in the memorandum of the .12th January, the procedure whichIwas adopted to restore the old-time Chinese regime in Outer Mongolia has been followed in regard to the &quot;Special Administrative Area&quot; of Hulunbuir or Barga. Once more the Chinese Government has issued a long communique to justify a one-sided abrogation of a Sino-Russian treaty the Barga Agreement of the 26th November, 1915. A Presidential Mandate, issued on the 28th January, announced that a deputation of Barga chiefs had petitioned the Chinese Lieutenant-Governor (Fu Tn-fung) to obtain the consent of the Peking Government to the abolition of the special status conferred on their country by the agreement. The memorial of the Lieutenant-Governor enclosing the petition was forwarded to Peking by Chang Tso-lin,IInspector-General of Manchuria, and by Sun Lieh-cheng, who is Military Governor of Heilungkiang Province, according to the usual Chinese procedure; and exactly as in the old days of Imperial decrees the President &quot;sanctions their request in accordance with the popular desire.&quot; Chang Tso-lin and the Military Governor are empowered to devise a scheme of reorganisation to fit the local conditions, and to submit it to the President for approval. &quot; Our aim shall be the fusion of the five families (Chinese, Manchu, Mongol, Mahommedan and Tibetan) into one household, all enjoying happiness and prosperity, in furtherance of the process of assimilation of all races as is desired by the Government, and as is earnestly sought by me, the President.&quot; .The explanatory communique issued officially at Peking through Reuter&apos;s Agency (29th January) begins with a reference to the happy results of the previous cancellation-tion of the Outer Mongol autonomy. Cordial and intimate relations have been re-established with the Urga hierarchy after a prolonged period of misunderstanding, due mainly to the intrigues of foreigners; and this &quot;happy reaffirmation of the principles on which the Republic of the Five Races is based,&quot; has now been followed by &quot;an equally important development in Barga.&quot; A short historical sketch is given to show that the changes now reversed were created by the policy of the Tsarist Government, which aimed at perpetuating feuds along the frontier regions of the Chinese dominions for selfish purposes.&apos; The truth is that Russia was particularly anxious in those days to gather all the country through which the Chinese Eastern Railway passed under her own wing, as far as possible, and the special status establishecl by the agreement of 1915 was only a step in this direction. This special status, the Chinese now allege, has not proved successful or desirable, and at the request of the Barga people themselves it has been abolished.The last paragraph of the communique is interesting as an indication of the policy which is now animating the Peking Government in matters relating to the outer dependencies and frontiers : &quot; In the difficult circumstances which have arisen throughout the entire territory of Asiatic Russia the reaffirmation of the authority of the&quot;Republic of China on every foot of soil where her right of eminent domain is incontestable is a guarantee of peace and tranquillity to the democratic nations of the world, and that the territorial officials of the republic, even in the most distant and inaccessible regions, are able and eager to guarantee that security has been recognised in a signal manner by the recent action of an associated Power in conferring high decorations on the Governor of Chinese Turkestan, and the ranking officer at^Kashgar,. for their loyal co-operation during the anxious period of the ,   world-war.&quot;I Prince Koudacheff, the Russian representative at Peking, has once more lodgeda protest on the same lines as in the case of Outer Mongolia, and has informed the Chinese Government that &quot; Russia maintains the indisputable right to determine her attitude in this question as soon as an ail-Russian Government has been recognised.&quot;AprilS. 1920.50  [2904]
