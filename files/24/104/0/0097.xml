April 26th, 1920.In reviewing the present social condition of Ireland the first essential is to realise the true nature of the revo-revolutionary movement - or, more properly, movements - in that country.. The people of Great Britain are extremely ill-informed on this important point, and we are not entirely con-vinced that even the Government have fully realised the forces with which they have to deal.The revolutionary movement is usually described as Sinn Fein, a convenient term which is., nevertheless, unfortunate, because it is misleading.   Sinn Fein was in its origin and re-garded by itself, still is political, aiming at an Irish Re-public cf the customary type.   But while Sinn Fein was in pro-cess of development there was also growing a revolutionary Labour Party, which aimed at an Irish Workers&apos; Republic.   This move-ment, which from the first was of an extreme socialist type, became inspired by the Industrial Workers of the world through James Connolly, and is now avowedly Bolshevik.   These organisa-tions were at first distinct, but were brought closer together by the events of the war and notably by the Rebellion.   Si-hat there is an understanding between them is evident from the fact that at the General Election Labour stooH down in favour of Sinn Fein.   How far these organisations have advanced towards coalition is difficult to say, but that there is close co-oper-ation between them is certain.The political and economic aims of the Labour Party may be judged fro/;, the following quotation from the statement presented by it to the Berne Labour Conference in February 1919. The recognition of Ireland&apos;s independence is, among other rea-sons claimed because ofthe
!&quot;Tho insuperable obstacle to the unity of the Irish workers and to tho economic re-conquest of Ireland by the working class, presented by the political, economic and national subjection of the Irish people to a foreign Pov/er.   Since the independence of the Irish people and the settlement of the issue between a subject people and an Imperialist Power, an essen-tial for the Union of the Irish Workers in a class-conscious movement for the conquest by the workers of political power, liberty, land and all resources, and the ownership and control of Ireland, and every-thing within Ireland.&quot; While Sinn Fein has prosecuted the military campaign for independence, and the work of spectacular propaganda, the Labour wing of the revolutionary movement has been In relations with the Labour Extremists in Great Britain.   The Limerick Soviet was avowedly designed to provoke &quot;responsive action&quot; in&apos; Great Britain, and failed, as Mr. Johnston, its parent, declared, because such action was not forthcoming.   The Labour Party is now adopting, the policy of direct action to support Sinn Fein.During the last few months a third revolutionary move-merit, has-appeared, this time agrarian.   It is extremely hard to analyse this movement with any accuracy.   It assumes various forms.(a)   There is the Sinn Fein plan for acquiring land.   This has a definite design.   It is financed by a Land Bank, which provides funds for buying out land owners at Sinn Fein&apos;s valuation. .The sale of land is enforced by terrorism and torture.
(b) There are various other manifestations which are purely anarchical.   Farmers who are considered to hold too much land are forced to give up part of it.   Men who desire to increase their holdings demand land from their neighbours.   Men who hire   land for tillage in small lots of ten acres or less are forced to abandon it if their presence is displeasing.   There ore cases when cattle are driven on to land and are maintained there by armed guards.   Owners who desire to 3ell their land are prevented from doing so.The one discernible basis of this agrarian movement appears to be a denial of any right of ownership.   It presents features reminiscent of the land policy of Russian Bolshevism.During the last few days it is announced that Sinn Fein has established Land Courts which pronounce decrees as to the ownership of land in complete opposition to the law,It is, of course, the fact that the Interests of these revolutionary movements not infrequently clash.   Agri-culturists suffer from the operations of the Labour Party,, and the agrarian spoliator will grab the land of a Sinn Feiner as cheerfully as that of a Unionist.   This naturally creates ill-feeling, but it is not the least serious symptom of Irish conditions that those aggrieved have to suffer in silence.We have there a tripartite revolutionary movement, each section of which has. different inspirations and methods, but which co-operate for the common purpose of opposing, and destroying the British connection. It is further to.be ob-. served that each of these movements shows marked different-&quot; negotiations from their predecessors,in,Ireland.Even,,-3-I
Fven Sinn Fein, the politic-al- movement,,. dif fNsrs. in important respects from those of the past.     The Labour movement is entirely new, and the agrarian movement is no longer directed against excessive rents or uncertainty of tenureoThis, we believe&apos;, is due very largely to foreign influence   re-inforccd by foreign money,,     Ireland has always shown herself susceptible to continental influences, and is equally, if not more susceptible to them to-day.    We are inclined to regard this as a cardinal factor In the situation and one which demands the especial attention of the GovernmentsIt is perhaps not surprising that the Bolshevik nature of the agrarian and Industrial movements has not been sufficiently recognised, but it is astonishing that the real character of the operations of Sinn Fein has not been detected in view of the fact that it has been openly proclaimed^    Sinn Fein has proclaimed a State of ^ar and possesses, a very complete organisation for Wart     We believe that full recognition of this fact is essential to any adequate plan for the maintenance of British rule,The Government, therefore, have to deal with three revolutionary movements, working more or less in unison^it     Political, operating by quasi-military methods, including assassination and destruction of Government property.8,     Industrial, operating by strikes,5*    Agrarian, partly organised by Sinn Fein andinspired by a definite purpose, partly the out-come of individual caprice or private animosity.As the/
As tho result of tho oo*.;r^ratloii of these forooathere is a complete paralysis of the law in large portions of the South and &quot;&quot;est of Ireland,     People - and we include many who are not Unionists - find themselves helpless0 By the evacuation of police barracks they arc deprived of protoctio,no .. Under this reign of terror aggrieved persons conocal their wrongs, witnesses dare not give evidence, and jurors dare not convict.     But, bad as it is, this is not the worst*    The step from resignation to tyranny to complicity with the tyrants is not long.     If that grave disaster is to be avoided the Government must act swiftly, strongly and above all without vacillation of purpose!?In order to understand the present appalling position of affairs in Ireland^ it is necessary to grasp the fundamental fact that the avowed object of the Sinn Fein movement is to drive out of Ireland every vestige of British constitutional authority, and to compel loyalists either to clear out or surrender6When this fundamental fact is grasped^ the various forms of outrage employed to further the end in view, will be seen, in their proper perspective0As residents in Ire1and, and well acquainted with the conditions existing in that country, and desirous of seeing law and order restored, we desire to offer some suggestions for the consideration and guidance of the GovernmentoIr.     One of the gravest defects of the Adminlnstration has been vacillation in policy.     In dealing with Irishmen firmness and consistency are the first essentials. It would be probably better to do nothing than to undo one day what has been done the day before..    The results of this vacillation have been deplorable in the&quot;weakening of authority, the encouragement of the disaffected, and indirectly, in the propogation of a crop ofrumours/&apos;
rumours and counter-rumours in the Press, which -cannot-failJ to embarrass the Government and those responsible for the administration of Ireland.2.    The evacuation of police stations has been undoubtedly a grave mistake, which if not remedied must prove fatal. All the abandoned police stations should be re-occupied, and the police should be replaced in a position to carry out their normal duties 6    the involves&apos; adequate military co-operation, which should have for its main object the protection of the police and their barracks in order that they may be free to fulfil their proper functions *3*    The system of imprisonment without trial should as far as possible, be discontinued.    There are certain exceptions, as in the case of persons against whom evidence of guilt is being sought for, or in the case of certain leaders, but it should be applied, if at all, with very careful discrimination,4, To meet the forcible expropriation of lands now becoming prevalent, a Proclamation should at once be issued against the retention under any circumstances of any land obtained by unlawful means,5, We find ourselves reluctantly constrained to express the opinion that the personnel of Dublin Castle calls for careful and drastic revision,The system of centralisation is carried to excess, and local initiation is curbed and stifled, by a detached bureaucracy, which is in some respaete inefficient, and which is, we regret to say, permeated with disloyalty. The sympathy of some officials with Sinn Fein is notorious, while there is not that close touch between Government officials and the well-disposed elements of the comfliu* nity which might he expected and which is urgently neocssary, We do not limit this remark to /
officials in Dublin, and we believe the Government should instruct their local agents to keep in touch with the law-abiding residents In their areas,6,    The Post Office and other Government Departments are permeated with Sinn. Fein,    Steps should be taken to remedy this at once by demanding the Oath of Allegiance from all Civil Servants.,We have avoided any reference to political questions, but we venture to express our strong conviction that the proposal to hand over the Government of Ireland to those who are responsible for its present condition is regarded by Sinn Fein as discounting the sincerity of the Government&apos;s- &apos;-intentions to maintain law and order, and at the same time discourage the servants of the Crown, charged with a very difficult duty,In a word the first object of the Government should be to establish the fact that loyalty pays anc\ disloyalty does not*-7-
