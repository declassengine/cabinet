SOSthis Document Is ,t?ie Property^ofSyrCP. L1.163Britannic fVl^(jy^y^    From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 23rd April .1920.(Received 26th, 8 p.m.)2 S.   Secret.   Afghanistan,   following from Dobbs, 22nd April :-&quot; At to-;day&apos;s sitting a discussion of remaining points&apos;under main heading of status and independence of Afghanistan was resumed. &quot; Point (C).   I said this had already been discussed.&quot; Point (D). I intimated that hope could be held out, in the event of a friend-ship treaty being eventually negotiated, for the establishment of Afghan Consuls at Bombay, Calcutta and Karachi, but explained impossibility from our point of view of allowing Vice-Consul at Peshawar, Quetta and Paraclrinar.&quot; Point (E). I attempted to explain to Afghans reasonableness of our stipulation regarding Bolsheviks and Indian seditionists and obvious difficulty which we have in believing in Afghan desire for our friendship after wanton attack last year. Discussion on this point has not yet been concluded and Afghans are showing themselves unexpectedly apologetic, and I hope frank expression of our feeling has done good.&quot;There was no meeting on 21st April.
