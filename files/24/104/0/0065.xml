-(&amp;33;5&quot;t1) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department,26th April 1920.(Received 27th, 7 p.m.)Clear the line.493 S. Secret. Afghanistan. In addition to two incidents reported in my Army telegram No. 183, of the 22nd April, an unprovoked attack was made on 23rd April by Afghan regular and irregular troops, number estimated at 500, with two guns, at Lambabat, in Chitral territory, which is at least three miles inside our frontier, vide agreement map forwarded with Lord Elgin&apos;s Secret Despatch No. ill, dated 11th June .1895. Dobbs immediately - sent Sir Abdul Qaiyum to make a strong protest to Malimud Tarsi, and to inform him that friendly conversations could not be continued in the face of such wanton acts of unprovoked aggression. Mahmud Tarsi seemed surprised, and professed complete ignorance, which was apparently genuine, of this and the other reported incidents. Mahmud Tarsi promised to address Amir, but Sir Abdul Qaiyum found Afghan delegates in the act of affixing their signatures to a letter to Dobbs, in which they stated that they, on their part, could not continue present conversations until they received satisfactory assurances regarding&apos;future, and a cessation of punishment of tribes. The conference is, therefore, temporarily suspended, and Dobbs has come to Simla to consult us regarding future course of action. Mahmud Tarsi has telegraphed to the Amir, asking what explanation he should give, and we are awaiting information regarding Amir&apos;s reply, and further news from Chitral, when we shall address you. Latest report is that 200 Afghans were attacking Darner on 24th, some eight miles still further inside the Chitral territory.Officer Commanding in Chitral has been authorised to use troops at Boehmer and (? Ishwara) to repel the aggression. Regarding Kuram incident, the Afghan Com-mander has sent reply not denying occupation, but saying that it is an encroachment, and that Political Agent, Kuram&apos;s letter has been referred to Afghan Governor at Khost.
