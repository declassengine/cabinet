jl::&apos; , This Document is the Property of 348.13      ** ,-------------pcrclTec; voCommittee of Home affairs  A S T A H H_BILL .(ES^IORAKDUM BY THE HOME SEO.PETA.py).The Bill is the first Order for May 7th./The object of the Bill may be to secure the welfare of illegitimate children, but the principle underlying its provisions is - find a father for every bastard - if the true father, so much the better - but in any case fix paternity upon someone and then make him pay a weekly allowance to the mother up to forty shillings.     To attain their object the promoters have adopted the following method.     Every mother of a bastard is bound to register the birth of the child and to give the full name of the person whom she alleges to be the father.     Thereupon (Clause Z), the Registrar must, within 7 days, send the form in the second schedule to the alleged father, asking him whether he admits being the father of the child, and if he does admit it whether he is willing to make, and if so what, provision for the maintenance of the child, and whether he desires to enter into a special agreement to be filed as an Order of the Court.     Then under Clause 7, if the man admits the paternity and offers to provide maintenance, the Collecting Officer   shall&apos; submit the offer to two Justices, who may approve the offer, or if they do not approve, the Collecting Officer shall apply for an Order under the Bastardy Act of 1872.     So much for the man who admits paternity.But under Clause 8, if the alleged father &quot;denies&quot; (according to the form this would mean that he did not admit) paternity, or fails duly to complete and return the form to the Registrar, the Collecting Officer shall apply for an Order under Section 4 of the Aot of 1872.     It will be seen that the Collecting Officer has no discretion in the matter at all. It would have been bad enough enough if he had   but these provisions, (Clauses 1, 2, 7 and 8) simply mean that any innocent man, whom the woman chooses to name as the father of   her bastard child, must either falsely admit the paternity and pay to avoid proceedings in that way, or stand the racket of affiliation proceedings.     It is true that by Clause 11 (2) he is entitled to an Order for his oosts if he is not adjudged to be the putative father of the child - not a very valuable concession.The whole of this procedure is preposterous.     An accusation of paternity of an illegitimate child is not an accusation of a criminal offence, but in many cases the consequences, both financially and socially, are far graver than those involved in many criminal cases, and to allow such interrogation is altogether opposed to the established rule with regard to the questioning of accused persons.      If this Bill were passed, anyone might expect to receive any morning one or it might be several  , letters from the Registrar asking whether or not the recipient admitted paternity.     The woman would know that she was expected to name someone,   &apos;
and if she did not know, or did not wish to say, who the father was, she could at unyrate name a person with regard to whom there had at least been opportunity for oonneotion which would lend some appearance of credibility to her story.     If the lir.it were raised to forty shillings it is probable that she would choose someone of means - probably, if a servant, her employer -likely to be adjudged to pay the full amount.This raising of the limit to such an amount as forty shillings marks a departure from the principle hitherto underlying our Bactardy Law that the jfather of an illegitimate child should be called upon to pay such a sum as will relieve the rates from the burden of maintaining the child.    Formerly that sum was five shillings per week and during the war it was increased to ten shillings.     A sum of forty shillings must be regarded much more in the nature of compensation to the woman, and it puts far too great a premium upon the birth of illegitimate children.Under the present lav/ an Order obtained by a woman for the maintenance of, a bastard child can be enforced against a putative father after the marriage cf the mother, although her husband is able to maintain the ohild (Hardy and Atherton - 7 Q.B.D.264); but it is doubtful whether the Justices have a discretion or not and whether , if they have a discretion, they ought to en-foroe an Order in such circumstances.    Clauses 17 and IS of this Bill are apparently intended to get rid of any difficulty of this kind and to allow a married woman or the Collecting Officer to get an Affiliation Order in respect of a child born before her marriage, and to continue to enforce Orders obtained&apos;,    I before her marriage.     Clause 17 actually allows a married woman who is living with her husband to obtain an Order in respect of an alleged illegitimate ohild born in wedlock.&apos;    If this Bill passes we may expect to hear of cases of women with two or three illegitimate children and  4 to  6 per week, contributed by two or three men, marrying a fourth, and continuing to draw her allowances.The promoters have seized upon the existence of Collecting Officers appointed under the Affiliation Orders Act, 1914 or under Section 30 of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, to make such officers not only mere Collecting Officers as they are under these Aots, but to constitute them official prosecutors fcr the purpose of fixing paternity upon the alleged fathers of bastard children.    They are given no discretion as to whether or not they areIto institute proceedings.   They must take   A.B. to Court, if the woman has named A.B. as the father of her child, and it is clear throughout the Bill thatIthey are to act as prosecutors. &quot;l:o compromise, dismissal by consent, or withdrawal I &quot;of any proceedings under this Act shall be binding&apos; without the approval thereof   \ *by the Justices, and the Collecting Officer shall be heard by them before giving j &quot;their decision&quot; (Clause 11 (l)).     Obviously the Collecting Officer would Ibecome a very responsible official. jEveryone wishes to diminish as far as passible the number of illegitimate births, to help the mothers of illegitimate children to rehabilitate themselves, and to see that the children are properly cared for.     But this Bill would tend to encourage the bearing of illegitimate children and the method of fixing paternity upon any person   named by the mother as   the putative father is quite inadmissible.8thApril, 1920. &quot; * &apos;y
