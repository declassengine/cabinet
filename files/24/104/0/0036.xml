y.....-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROffiRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.147-CABINET. LONDON TRAFFIC AUTHORITY. -   MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.1.    With regard to the memorandum of the 9th instant (CP, 1042) by the Minister of Transport, it is not clear from the report of the Advisory Committee on London Traffic (Cmd... 636) what exactly they propose should be the powers of the suggested London Traffic Authority.     It would appear from their recommendations (page 13) that the body is. to be advisory.     It seems, however, from the proposals in Appendix 2 (pages 36 and 37) that the body is to have executive powers;   and, this, I gather, is the intention of the Minister of Transport.2.     The proposed Traffic Authority would have housing and town planning powers which are now vested in LocalAuthorities.     Among the matters with which the TrafficAuthority would have to deal, according to the recommenda-tions of the Advisory Committee, are -&quot;(3) The study of all town planning and housing , schemes which must be submitted by the Ministry of Health, Local Authorities, and others for considera-tion on traffic grounds.(4) The preparation of an authoritative general development plan to which all new London transit schemes should conform.xxX(7) The fixing of building or frontage lines on roads. &quot;In the first of these recommendations, it is recognised that town planning is a matter for Local
^    148Authorities.    Tho Committee do not appear to have appreciated, however, that the other two of these recommendations seriously encroach on those powers.    The Traffic Authority would, in fact.,, become, if given executive powers, very largely a town planning authority.To&apos; any proposal of this kind there are obvious objections, and it would, I feel sure, be strongly resisted, The very wide town planning powers of Local Authorities were considerably enlarged by the Housing Act of last year; and? at the instance of the Committee of the House of Commons which considered the Bill, town planning was made obligatory, after 1923, on all urban local authorities with a population of 20..C0C or over,    A large number of town planning schemes in the outer metropolitan area have already been under consideration.To secure the proper determination even of roads, much more of building and frontage lines, it is not enough to have regard simply to traffic requirements.They can be properly considered only as part of a general town planning scheme.    To determine them from the standpoint of traffic alone, which, after all, is but one aspect of the problem, would be to invite chaos,I consider, therefore, that if a Traffic Authority is established, it should not have power to deal with matters which are now within the scope of the Local Authorities as the bodies responsible for housing and town planning; but. should be restricted to the management ofN traffic i-3.      I may add that in my opinion Local Authorities would strongly resist any proposal that they should pay
the expenses of the Traffic Authority and have no voice either in its appointment or in its policy.4.     It is of course, fully recognised that in&apos; considering large Town Planning Schemes, the Ministry of Health should freely consult the Ministry of Transport   on the proposals as they affect transport questions,Ministry of Health,0. ADDISON.22nd April, 1920.
