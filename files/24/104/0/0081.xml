CP. 1180       Jo,!ffiMORA.])TOM BY THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER.367*c?, aft.Tho Shipping Controller understands thrvo the Coal Controller is it ting to the Cabinet new proposals relative to coal prices,, and ho i&apos;0S to wake tho following observations in regard to tho prico of Jor coal for foreign going vassols:- . &apos;A British ship is to all intents and purposes a British factory and it is difficult to justify giving better treatment to tho factory on Jand than to the shipj in the matter of fuel prices. The price of coal has a very great influence on freights and passage money.    Some heavy losses have been made by ships, and one Liner on an Australian voyage recently completed had a debit balance of  50,000, due almost entirely to the cost of bunker coal. The cost of coal for the voyago of P,&amp; 0, steamer &quot;NALDERA&quot; now on passage to Australia will be no less than  63,400. for the round voyage, including cheap Australian coal, and the cost of coal for steamer &quot;KAKiru^DA&quot; just sailed for Bombay will bo  34,000, including cheap Indian coal.    It will be impossible to continue to run such vessels except at what may prove prohibitive rates of freight, and passage money, if present prices of bunkers are maintained. The Increased cost of running ships has been so great *that, speaking generally, since the Armistice, Government cargoes have been carried at round about cost price end the principal profit&apos; made by shipping has been made either In freights paid by the foreigners or in trade away from the United Kingdom,Inward freights are shewing a distinct tendency to fall so far as the increased cost of running will allow, and nothing will help -the downward movement so mucii as a reasonable price for bunker coal. The Shipping Controller urges most strongly the course suggested.(Srd) J,P,FiACLAY.f8/4/20,
