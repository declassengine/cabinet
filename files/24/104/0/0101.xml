COASTAL SUBSIDY SCHEME,470CP 1 7 09    y^MSSM BY THS RESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRAPS AND ^J        THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER,9&apos;&apos;1In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet of April 22jtd. a conference of shipowners concerned in the coasting trade of the United Kingdom was held at the Ministry of Shipping on April 29th, at which the President of the Board of Trade and the Shipping Controller were present,The position was explained to the Shipowners and the question of discontinuing the present Coastal Subsidy Scheme was discussed,The shipowners stated unanimously that if the exceptional railway rates referred to en page 7.   of the Report of the Ministry of Transport Rate3 Advisory Committee, dated 16th December (C.M.D.525 1919, were withdrawn and the goods charged at the existing class rates, they would have no hesitation as to their ability to continue the coasting services; but if the Coastal Subsidy Scheme were withdrawn without any step being taken to deal with the present anomalies in the matter of railway rates, it would be impossible for them to continue the present services owing to the increased and increasing  *costs of working.The paragraph in the Report of the Ministry of Transport Rates Advisory Committee is as follows:-&quot;(C), Rates affected by Competition by Water.&quot;It was brought to our notice that many rates have been fixedV.-&apos; l/ *&quot;exceptionally low by reason of the competition -which existed &quot;before the war between the railways &amp;nl carriers hy water,I,e., &quot;both by sea and by canal, and we took note of the fact that, &quot;by reason of the great increase in the cost,of carriage by water, &quot;the latter form of competition has ceased to operate, so that &quot;there Is   now no occasion for the low railway rates, while the &quot;fact of the existence of such low rates has the effect of ^diverting to the railways traffic which was formerly carried by &quot;water and ought still, in the interests of the nation, &quot;to be &quot;so carried, and the further effect of causing an undue &quot;congestion in docks, and warehouses and upon the railways.
.    n 471&quot;We anxiously considered whether any revision of rates &quot;could be effected to mitigate or abolish this undesirable &quot;state of things.   We, however, came to the conclusion that&apos; &quot;only the overhauling of a very large number of .&quot;individual rates could   cure this evil, particularly having &apos; &quot;regard to the fact that it is not only between seaport and &quot;seaport that the pre-war competition caused a reduction in &quot;rates, but the same effect was produced in regard to the &quot;carriage of goods to and from places   in the neighbourhood &quot;of, or even at some distance from, such seaports,e.g., the &quot;rates for wool traffic from London to Bradford are affected &quot;by the pre-war competition, by sea, by vessels trading &quot;between London and the Humber ports.   V/e therefore &quot;reluctantly came to the conclusion that we cannot deal &quot;with this anomaly at this stage&quot;*It is clear that these exceptional railway rates have a close and direct bearing on the question and we recommend that a Committee consisting of three representatives of coasting shipowners and three representatives nominated by the Ministry of Transport should be appointed   at once to consider these exceptional railway rates and the corresponding shipping rates, and to report by the 15th of May. In the meantime, pending a decision on the question of these railway rates we recommend that the coastal Subsidy Scheme should continue.   Yvre understand that there is sufficient money to carry on the Scheme till about the end of June.R,S. HORNTi., J.P. MAC LAY.29/4/20,
