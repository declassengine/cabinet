Referred to nctnCommittee of Home Affairs 323(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERBXENT)(^SECRET. Copy No:_ _CP. 1166.&apos;    CABINET.The Ecclesiastical Tithe Rent Charge (Rates) Bill.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary cf the Ministry tf Agriculture and Fisheries.I circulate for the members of the Home Affairs Committee a minute on an amendment which Sir Samuel Hoare proposes to move in Committee on the Eoolesiastiaal Tithe Rent Charge (Rates) Bill, and as the &quot;bill will probably be considered in Oimmittee next week, I ask that the matter may be treated an urgent.The Bill, which temporarily-fixes the rates on tithe rent charge attached to benefices and belonging ta capitular establishments at the poundage at which tney stood in 1918, (when the rise in the value of tithe rent oharge was stopped &quot;by Aot of Parliament and fixed at has not been at all well reoeivedby the clergy generally, who have been demanding tho total exemption of tithe rent charge, which is their professional income, from rates.     This demand has been stimulated by the fact-that Sir Samuel Hoare and other private members have brought in a   bill with thin object in view, which has the ; iawfc place on the order paper on Friday lay 7th.     I realise that the Government cannot owioede this demand, since it would certainly cause trouble among ether ratepayers, who hold that the whtle question of the incidenoe cf local taxation requires revision. In the debate, however, on the second reading of the Government Bill, Sir Samuel Hoare intimated that if an amendment were accepted in Committee giving total a^.ernption to those clergy who by reason of the smallness of their incomes could olaim exemption from Income Tax, and &amp; further reduction in the case of th*,se whose-incomes were lass than  500 a year, his objection
to the bill would largely &quot;be removed, and he would very likely not move hio own bill, mr at least net press it.     Other members expressed the same view, and I have ascertained from representative olergy that it would remove the sting of the opposition.     The ooncession would be temporary like the rest of the bill, and would cease in 1926, when the Act of 1918 stopping the rise in tithe rent oharge comes to an end, and the whole question would have to be reconsidered then.     It 3hould be cHerved that there is a   precedent for suoh remission or abetment in the case of Land Tax, originally granted in the Finance Aot t?f 1398 (^a^ag^a^i IS).The matter has been carefully considered here and we are disposed to accept the amendment, though not necessarily in the exact terms suggested &amp;y Sir Samuel Hoare,     I, therefore, ask the Home Affairs Committee to give me authority to do this, and I would point out that if we deal with this vexed question at all, it is best to di* so in such a way as to give some sort ef general satisfaction.     Sir Samuel Hoare&apos;e proposed amendment is attached.     (Appendix),(Signed)   ARTHUR. G. BOSCAHvEN.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 28th April, 1920.
