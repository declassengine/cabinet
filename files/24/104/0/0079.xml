Oopj Ho.      ^AGHICuI/UUS^ BILL.Note by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.Por the convenience of my colleagues in the Cabinet, I circulate the accompanying explanatory Notes on tho clauses of fcjthe Agriculture Bill.XI of 2\April 28th 1920.
Agriculture Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause 1.This clause makes permanent the temporary provisions of the Corn Production Act, 1917, including the provisions as to Agricultural Wages and enforcement of proper cultivation, but a special provision is made for bringing to an end, if so desired, the system of guarantee for cereals by an Order in Council made in an Address presented by each House, but only so as to operate at the end of four years after the Order is made. Though it will be possible for any Parliament to repeal the Act forthwithj this provision indicates as clearly as is possible that the Parlia-mentary inducement held out to farmers is, that they will have four years&apos; notice of any cessation of guarantees.Clause 2.The effect of this clause is merely to place barley in the same position as wheat and oats for the purpose of the guarantee given by Part I. of the Corn Production Act, 1917. As in the case of wheat the payment is to be made on acreage, and to be based on four times the difference between the average price and the minimum price per quarter. The &quot; Quarter&quot; for this purpose is 400 lbs. as in the Corn Returns Act, 1892. These amendments are recommended by the Majority Report of the loyal Commission on Agriculture.Clause 3.The statutory quarters are denned as being:-Wheat, 480 lbs.; Barley, 400 lbs.; Oats, 312 lbs. The customary quarters are, Wheat, 504 lbs.; Barley, 448 lbs.; Oats, 336 lbs.Clause 4.The present minimum prices fixed by the Corn Production Act are for 1920, 1921, and 1922-45*. per quarter (480 lbs.) of wheat and 24s. per quarter (312 lbs.) of oats.142-1 A
The minimum prices for 1920 under this clause are those recommended by the Royal Commission, viz.!: These are based on the estimated cost of production of the 1919 crop.The &quot;Royal Commission did not recommend that these should be the minimum prices fixed for the year 1920, but that prices should be fixed in 1920 which would be greater or less than the figures given in the report, in the same proportion as the cost of production in 1920 is found to be greater or less than the cost of production in 1919. The disadvantage of this pro-posal, from the point of view of stimulating production, is that the grower would not know the minimum price upon which he could count until after his crop was harvested. It is considered that the method adopted in this clause, though not so strictly accurate, is preferable. It fixes the prices of each year according to the increase or decrease of the cost of production of the preceding year. This will enable the prices for any year to be ascertained and published soon after the previous harvest. This will be much more satisfactory to farmers, in that they will know at the time of sowing the minimum prices upon which they can count for the harvested crop.iOn this principle the minimum prices recommended on the basis of the cost of production in 1919 are fixed by the Bill as the prices for 1920, and become the standard prices for the purpose of fixing minimum prices for subsequent years. The cost of production in 1919 is in like manner treated as the standard of cost of production for comparison! with the cost of production of a subsequent year. The actual cost of production of cereals on different farms varies enormously, and it would be an impossible task to ascertain the average cost of production of a quarter of any cereal. It is proposed to make no attempt to achieve this, but to ascertain each year the average percent-age of increase or decrease in the costs of production generally. It is believed that this percentage will be nearly uniform, though the actual cost on different farms varies so considerably. The only item of cost in which any variation is to be dis-regarded is rent.  This is in accordance with the recommendationBarleyWheatOats- 68s. per quarter (504 lbs.)- 46.9. per quarter (336 lbs.)- 59s. per quarter (448 lbs.)
of the Report of the Commission, and may be justified on the grounds (1) that actual variations of rent do not closely coincide with the current cost of production; and(2) that if such variations were not excluded from the calculations, it might be contended that landlords by increasing their rents could increase the minimum prices.Clause 5.This clause sets up the Commission to fix the minimum prices, and gives them the necessary powers to obtain the information they may require. The three Commissioners are to be appointed for an indefinite period, one by the three Agri-cultural Departments jointly, one by the Treasury, and one by the Board of Trade, who may be regarded for this purpose as representing the consumers.Clause 6.This deals with a series of amendments of section 9 of the Corn Production Act (Power to enforce proper cultivation).Amendment (i).Under section 9 (1) of the Act of 1917, the Minister can take action if of opinion &quot; (a) that any land is not being cultivated according to the rules of good husbandry; or&quot; (b) that for the purpose of increasing in the national interest the production of food, the mode of culti-vating any land or the use to which any land is being put should be changed.&quot;The amendment substitutes for (b) the following &quot;(b) that the production of food on any land can be increased by an improvement or change in the manner of cultivating or using the land which is not calculated to affect injuriously the persons interested in the land.&quot; 142 A 2
It also adds a new ground for action, viz. &quot; (*?) that the owner of land in the occupation of a tenant has neglected to execute the necessary repairs (not-being repairs which a tenant is liable to execute) to any buildings on the land being repairs required for the proper cultivation or working thereof/&apos;and makes the consequential amendments as to the notices that can be served under the section.During the war the Government claimed that farmers must, in the national interest, grow more cereals even when this might involve them in loss, and therefore agreed to a scheme of com-pensation in such cases. The policy now proposed is that the State should only be empowered to enforce increased arable culti-vation, and also a higher standard of cultivation of both arable and grass, where this is possible without injury to the persons interested in the land. The conversion of land from grass to arable is to some extent a speculation, but if the prospects of such a step resulting in a gain are at least as great as the prospect of loss, the persons interested in the land would not be &quot;injuriously affected,&quot; provided that the necessary adjustments are made as between landlord and tenant. Provision for such adjustment is made under section 9, subsection (I).In future it is proposed to give an appeal against an order to plough, on the ground that such requirement will injuriously affect the persons interested, but not to give any right to compensation if the actual results are not what might reasonably have been expected. This protects the State against having to pay compensation for losses which may be due entirely to bad farming or to bad weather.At present the position is as follows: Two farmers may be required to plough under circum-stances which any impartial person would say are equally calculated to result in profit, and where no financial inducement is reasonably required to secure ploughing. The actual results may be that one farmer makes a profit, and the other makes a loss for which the State has to pay. In other words, the farmers served with notices keep any resulting profit, but suffer no resulting loss.   This is unfair to the State.The second part of the amendment deals with the case of a landlord who does not carry out the necessary repairs to
buildings, which he is expected to carry out, but as a general rule does not covenant to carry out. This is a not infrequent cause of bad results in farming.Amendment (ii).This is a consequential amendment as to the grounds of appeal against cultivation notices, and against the new notices to execute repairs.Amendment (iii).The first subsection (2a) proposed by this amendment deals with the enforcement of directions in connection with the culti-vation of land. Under clause 9 this can only be done by determination of a tenant&apos;s lease, or, if the defaulter is the owner, by entry and occupation of the land. These remedies may be useful in some cases where the negligent cultivation or refusal to adopt improved methods applies generally to an entire holding, but they are inappropriate and much too severe for the more usual case of a single work of cultivation which requires to be carried out promptly.The new subsection (2a) provides, therefore, for summary proceedings for default, with a fine of 201. and 11. a clay during the time the default continues. It may be desirable to limit this to default after conviction. As a concurrent remedy the Ministry, who will act through a County Agricultural Com-mittee, can do the required work and recover the expense from the defaulter.The other new subsection (2e) deals with default by a land-lord in executing necessary repairs. In this case the tenant is authorised to execute the repairs and forthwith recover the cost from the owner, or by a charge on the land in the same way as he recovers compensation for improvements under the Agricultural Holdings Act5.Amendment (iv).At present the Minister can determine a tenancy or authorise a landlord to determine it. If the Minister thinks such deter-mination desirable, he should take the responsibility and not merely authorise the landlord to do so, which authority he might not care to exercise.   The amendment is to this effect.
Amendment (v).Cases have occurred where food production is impeded by general and gross mismanagement of an estate. At present no effective remedy exists for such a state of affairs. The amend-ment enables the Minister, on the representation of the County Agricultural Committee, and after full inquiry, to appoint a receiver and manager of the estate, who will, subject to the terms of the Ministers order, he able to exercise all the powers that could be exercised by the owner. His remuneration will be paid out of the estate. The owner is given an appeal to the High Court.Amendment (vi).This amendment makes subsection (4), which relates to a record of a holding on possession of land being taken, applicable to cases where a receiver is appointed, and requires the record to be demanded within one month instead of three months after the entry, or the appointment of the receiver.Amendment (vii).This amendment restricts the right to compensation to cases in which possession of land has been taken hy or on behalf of, the Ministry.Amendment (viii).This amendment proposes to add three subsections to section 9.The first subsection (11) makes it clear that certain matters which are connected with proper cultivation, but in themselves might not be considered to fall within the expression &quot; cultiva-tion according to the rules of good husbandry,&quot; may be treated as falling within such expression.The occupier may by this means be required to  (1) maintain existing drains, &amp;c.; (2) execute new drainage improvements; (3) maintain fences, &amp;c.; and (4) execute necessary repairs.The new subsection (12) enables the Minister to deal with the nuisance to farmers and gardeners caused by neglect to
destroy weeds on lands which are not cultivated, e.g., railway embankments, roadside waste or common land.The highway authority is made responsible for the destruction of the weeds on their roads.The weeds to which the subsection will apply are to be prescribed by regulation.The new subsection (13) provides that where any claim is made that the result of a Cultivation Order will injuriously affect the persons interested in the land, any loss of value of sporting rights shall not be taken into consideration. This applies chiefly to moors and deer forests where, in some cases, production of food is sacrificed to sporting. If the interests of the State require that this should be remedied, it is considered that the sporting interests should give way and that no compensation by the State should be payable.Clause 7.This clause provides for service of notices and removes certain difficulties which now exist where the occupier cannot be found.Clause 8.Compensation for disturbance by service of a notice to quit on a tenant is at present payable only (1) where the notice to quit is given without good and sufficient cause and for reasons inconsistent with good estate management;(2) where it is proved that an increase of rent is demanded by reason of an increase in the value of the holding due to improvements executed by the tenant;(3) where notices to quit are given in connection with sales and the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1914, applies;(4) in the case of acquisition of land by the Board or a Council for small holdings.
Compensation in such cases is limited to the loss or expense directly attributable to the quitting which the tenant may unavoidably incur upon or in connection with the sale or removal of his household goods or his implements of- husbandry, produce or farm stock on or used in connection with the holding.It has been decided that notices to quit given with a view to the readjustment of the rent are not a ground for compensation under these provisions, and the existing provisions are inadequate from the point of view of the tenant, partly because in many cases he is unable to show that the termination of his tenancy is unreasonable, and partly because the measure of compensation docs not cover all his loss.Subsection (1) of clause 8 provides that compensation for disturbance shall be paid in all cases where a tenant is not in default. For this purpose he is treated as in default if he refuses to agree to a demand by his landlord for a reasonable increase in rent or for an arbitration as to whether the rent should be increased. Conversely, the landlord is required to pay compensation for disturbance as if he had determined the tenancy in any case where he refuses the demand of a tenant for a reasonable reduction of rent or for an arbitration as to such reduction. The object of this last provision is to provide a means by which landlord and tenant can secure a re-adjustment of rent without introducing the procedure of a land court and without the present necessity for service of notice to quit.Subsection (3) prevents demands for increase or reduction of rent being made except at intervals of two years.Subsection (4) provides that the compensation in ordinary cases for disturbance shall include not only the specific items above referred to, but also any loss or expense directly attributable to the quitting, including the expenses of the preparation of the claim for compensation other than the costs of an arbitration in the matter. Also one year&apos;s rent in addition. These costs will be in the discretion of the arbitrator. &quot;Where the notice to quit is given capriciously, that is, &quot; without good and sufficient cause &quot; and for reasons inconsistent with good estate management,&quot; but in no other case, additional compensation equal to not less than one year&apos;s rent nor more than four years&apos; rent is given.Much difficulty arises now in consequence of the provision in the Agricultural Holdings Act that compensation shall be
paid by the person who is the landlord at the expiration of the tenancy even though he did not give the notice to quit which is the basis of the claim for disturbance. Subsection (8) provides that the landlord liable to pay this compensation shall be the landlord by whom the notice to quit is given.Clause 9.This clause places tenants who hold upon lease for a term of years upon the same footing as yearly tenants as regards compensation for disturbance. &apos; Under the Agricultural Holdings Act, section 11, a somewhat similar provision exists as to compensation for a refusal to grant a renewal of a tenancy. The clause is based on clause 18 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1908, and its effect is that leases will automatically continue in force as yearly tenancies unless they are determined by notice to quit. Such a notice, like notices to determine the yearly tenancy, may be the subject of a claim for unreasonable disturbance. The clause does not apply to any tenancy expiring earlier than 1 January 1922, so as to enable the necessary notice to be given.Clause 10.Compensation is not payable for improvements comprised in Part I. of the First Schedule to the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, unless the landlord has agreed to them in writing. The Schedule comprises all the more permanent improvements except drainage, which is comprised in Part II. of the First Schedule.The position as regards drainage is that the landlords consent is not required, but before the drainage is executed by the tenant he must give the landlord an opportunity of doing the work, in which case the landlord is entitled to charge additional rent on a percentage prescribed by the Act.It is proposed that where a tenant wishes to execute an improvement in the First Part of the Schedule, and is unable to secure his landlords consent, he should be entitled to apply to the County Agricultural Committee for a direction that the improvement should be treated as one coming under Part II. of the Act of 1908. The Agricultural Committee, after hearing the landlord and tenant, may, subject to any conditions that they think fit, authorise the execution of the improvement.142 B
*This procedure should provide a means by which permanent improvements can be secured and at the same time prevent the general character of a holding being unreasonably changed to meet the special needs or whim of a tenant.Subsection (2) enables the Minister by regulation to prescribe the percentage on cost that may be charged by the landlord to the tenant on improvements executed under this arrangement.This arrangement does not apply &quot;to an improvement com-prised in the Third Schedule,&quot; that is to say, market-garden improvements. At present a tenant is only entitled to compen-sation for these market-garden improvements where it is agreed in writing that the holding shall be treated as a market-garden, or where the market-garden was in existence in 1896, and subsection (2) of section 42 of the Act of 1908 applies. In practice, landlords decline to enter into any agreement making these special provisions applicable to their holdings, and market-gardening is impeded by their attitude. Subsection (3) of this clause enables a tenant to obtain a direction from the County Agricultural Committee that the special provisions as to market-gardens shall apply wholly or partly to his land, but this is subject to certain special conditions (a) and (b), which in effect bring into force what is known as the &quot;Evesham Custom.&quot; The general effect of them is that, if the tenancy is determined by the tenant, he must produce a successor willing to take over the farm and satisfy his claim for improvements. If the landlord refuses to accept the successor as a tenant, or if the landlord himself determines the tenancy, he has to pay compensation for market-garden improvements.Clause 11.This clause enables the tenant to recover compensation for the continuous adoption of a system of farming higher than is required by Ms contract of tenancy or custom, provided that a record of the holding has been made. It is based on the recommendations of the Selborne Committee. Paragraph (5) excludes from this provision compensation for permanent improvements for which the consent of the landlord is required.Clause 12.It not infrequently happens that, owing to a farm being divided for the purposes of sale, the outgoing tenant is hampered
in recovery of his compensation by reason of the divided owner-ship, and this clause enables a claim. to be dealt with as a whole, and the liability to be apportioned by the arbitrator among the persons liable.Clause 13.At present a landlords right to bring his claims for dilapidations, &amp;c, before an arbitrator depends, in the absence of agreement, on a claim for improvements being lodged by the tenant. The landlord could resort to the courts, but is unwilling to do so, and the Report of the Selborne Committee recommends that all claims at the end of the tenancy shall be determined by the arbitrator. This is the effect of subsection (1) of this clause.Subsection (2) requires particulars of all claims to be delivered within three months after the end of the tenancy.Clause 14.The Selborne Committee made various recommendations as to reform of arbitration procedure. It is thought better not to deal with all of these in the Bill, but to take power to deal with the matter by regulation, and merely deal with two items (1) the making of separate awards on several claims; and (2) the making of an award for a payment on account.At present, in some cases, the payment of compensation is unduly deferred by a reference to the courts on a question of law, which very possibly affects only one item of this claim.Clause 15.It is proposed to constitute a panel of arbitrators for the purposes of the Agricultural Holdings Acts, who are to be nominated, jointly, by the Lord Chief Justice of England, the President of the Surveyors Institution, and the President of the National Farmers&apos; Union. Prom this panel all arbitrators nominated by the Minister will be selected.The clause also deals with the remuneration of arbitrators.Clause 16.Leases often contain a power of resumption for ^building, &amp;c. The position of the tenant in such a case, where the tenancy 142 B 2
of the holding is not determined, is doubtful, and this clause proposes that in respect of the land resumed (1) the provisions as to &quot;compensation shall apply, if the part to which the notice of resumption refers were a separate holding;(2) the tenant shall be entitled to a reduction of rent, to be settled, if necessary, by arbitration.Chuse 17.Leases often contain provisions for payment of an additional rent or compensation on grass land being broken up which is out of all proportion to the damage caused. The proviso to section 25 of the Act of 1908 allows these to be enforced, and tins is done sometimes by way of defeating a quitting tenants claims to compensation for improvements. The effect of the amendment is to restrict the landlords claim to the actual damage.Clause 18.A tenanfs claim for compensation is, as a rule, a personal claim against the landlord, who, in one case which has come to the departments notice, became bankrupt, with the result that the tenant lost his money and the mortgagees who took possession after the end of the tenancy obtained the benefit of the improvements.Where the landlord is a trustee, the amount is recoverable by means of a charge on the holding, and the clause provides that this remedy shall be available in all cases. Under section 16 of the Act of 1908 the charge is only on the landlords interest and interests subsequent to that of the landlord, and where the landlord is a tenant, only on his leasehold interest. The clause provides that the charge shall be a first charge on the land which has been improved, but enables the charge to be so framed as to adjust equitably the burden of the charge as between the various interests in the land.Clause 19,Under section 40 of the Act of 1908 the statutory powers of a landlord can, in the case of Ecclesiastical landlords, be exercised only with certain consents.
For instance, a consent by a landlord to .the execution by the tenant of an improvement in .the schedule of permanent improvements can only be given with such consents. These, in practice, are overlooked, and the tenant suffers by losing his compensation.It is proposed by this clause to put Ecclesiastical landlords on the same footing as other landlords in this respect, except as regards the landlords power to create a charge. This follows the precedent of section 41, which applies to charitable trustees.Clause 20.In a case recently decided, it was held that a tenant of a farm and public-house could not recover compensation for his agricultural improvements, as the whole of the property leased did not come within the definition of &quot;holding&quot; in section 48. Such mixed holdings are common, and the clause provides that the provisions as to compensation shall apply to the agricultural part of the hoiding as if it were a separate holding.Clause 21.It is generally provided in a contract of tenancy that a tenant shall not sell off the manure, compost or the hay or straw grown in the last year, thus enabling the incoming tenant to farm properly on entry. The clause provides that, in all cases, except where otherwise agreed, the outgoing tenant shall not, after notice to quit has been given, sell off such things until he has given his landlord a reasonable opportunity of purchasing them.Clause 22.This is merely an adaptation of section 27 of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1908, which is required by clause 11 of this Bill.Clause 23.This repeals the existing provision allowing agreements as to compensation for improvements comprised in Part III. of the First Schedule of the Act of 1908. The amendment is recommended by the Selborne Committee.
Clause 2LThis provides that, except in connexion with allotment gardens, a tenancy of an agricultural holding shall not be determined by a notice to quit of less than 12 months.Clauses 25, 26, 29.These do not call for comment as they are, so far as necessary, dealt with in notes on the First Schedule.First Schedule.Amendments of the Act of 1908.Section one, subsection (1).In a Scottish case of Galloway v. McClelland, the Court had to decide whether a tenant was entitled to compensation for temporary pasture, which he was under his contract of tenancy obliged to leave, and which was only the equivalent of the temporary pasture he found on entry. The Court decided against the tenant, and one ground was that to entitle the tenant to compensation for an improvement, its execution must have been voluntary.If this remains the law, it would be possible to defeat, to a material extent, the object of the Act, e.g., by requiring the tenant to apply yearly certain amounts of artificial manure for which, consequently, he could not claim compensation. The Act of 1908 did not expressly state that an improvement must be voluntary, and the amendment is intended to override the decision in this respect.The point for decision in the case is further dealt with by the amendment proposed later to the First Schedule to the Act of 1908.Subsection (2).This amendment is to limit the provision to crops grown on the holding within the last two years of the tenancy. It is recommended by the Selborne Committee.Section fifteen.This enables a charge to include the cost of obtaining the charge, and makes s. 15 (1) like s. 35 (iii) in this respect.
Section sixteen,See note on clause 18. Where a charge is obtained by the landlord for compensation payable by him, but not otherwise, the charge should be limited to the landlords interest in the land.Section hoenty-three.The first amendment is an unimportant one suggested by the Selborne Committee.The second amendment provides for cases where the reduction of rent on re-entry on part of a holding is regulated by agreement.Section forty-eight.That is to remove any doubt as to an allotment garden being a &quot;holding,&quot; to which the Act of 1908 applies, though not &quot;cultivated as a market-garden.&quot;First Schedule.The first amendment limits the right to compensation for temporary pasture to such as is in excess of the temporary pasture received on entry without compensation. If a tenant paid for any temporary pasture on entry, such should not be set off against his claim on quitting. This amendment is intended to meet the difficulty felt in the case of Galloway v. McClelland above referred to.The second amendment authorises a tenant to claim com-pensation for haulage by him of materials for the purposes of an improvement executed by the landlord.iSecond Schedule.This requires payment of compensation under an award within one month. At present it is payable &quot;not sooner than one month or later than two months &quot; after the award.Agricultural Moldings Act, 1914.Section one.This amendment is consequential on clause 8 (5) (6).
