From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 23rd April 1920.(Received 8 p.ra., 24th.)485 S. Secret. Afghanistan. Following telegrams are repeated for your information : First from Viceroy to Dobbs : &quot; I am much concerned over these two frontier episodes at Chamen and Tandisar at a time when we are trying to remove misunderstandings with Afghanistan. But I think they are in reality weapons to your hand. You should discuss them privately with Tarsi, and point out how difficult it is for us to discuss removal of misunder-standings frankly with them when at the very same moment such things occur; that we have been told that there are two parties in Afghanistan, one wishing friendship, the other wishing to keep misunderstandings alive ; that the Tandisar incident looks as if the latter party was endeavouring to hamper the friendly discussions ; that you hope he wi]l write to Amir and (ask him to ?) issue orders which will have effect of preventing recurrence of such disturbing incidents.&quot; Your telegram of the 20th April to Foreign. Point (E). Grant&apos;s conditions are not incompatible with independence. They merely state plainly manner in which Afghanistan can show its friendliness. Hospitality shown to uncompromising enemies of British Government is not a sign of friendliness, but of reverse, and cannot be disregarded by us when a treaty of friendship is to be considered.&quot;Second from Dobbs to Viceroy :-&quot;I spoke privately to JVJahmud Tarsi this morning on the lines contained in your Excellency&apos;s telegram regarding two frontier episodes. He at first attempted to argue that, so long as our operations in Waziristan continue, such episodes must be feared owing to excitement produced thereby on frontier. I was naturally very-severe on this argument, and he quickly retracted, and took refuge in theory suggested by your Excellency that these incidents may be engineered by other party which wishes to impede friendship. He promised to telegraph at once to Amir about both incidents.&quot; Mahmud Tarsi has shown himself very amenable about communications with Indian agitators, and has now voluntarily (given us ?) full authority to stop anyone from approaching him, and to stop without reference to him the delivery of any unsuitable telegrams to him, one or two of which have recently arrived. He has stipulated, however, that letters addressed to him shall not be interfered with.&quot; I am very uneasy as to results of discussion on point (F), refusal of title of His Majesty. Very confidential enquiries go to show that immense importance is attached to this point, and that whole conference may be wrecked upon it. Persons in Mahmud Tarsi&apos;s confidence say that if it is not conceded, he may perhaps not dare to return to Afghanistan.&quot; (For reference to points (E) and (F), please see my telegram of 21st April, No. 474 S.
