This document is the property of His Britannic-Majesty^ Government.SECRET.3mm   $THE CABINET.GENERAL MALLESON&apos;S FORCE AT MESHED.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRI&quot;^ YRY OF STATE FOR WAR.When I presented the Army Estimates to the Cabinet, a decision was taken that General Malleson&apos;s force should be &quot; immediately and entirely withdrawn &quot; from Meshed. My Estimates have been framed upon this basis, and I have no funds available,, without going again to Parliament, to meet the heavy charge entailed in maintaining this force. I am strongly opposed to its retention, which is regarded both by the War Office and the India Office as unnecessary. I enquired a few days ago what progress had been made in the evacuation of this force. I am informed that no progress whatever has been made, as Lord Curzon had requested Mr. Montagu to postpone the withdrawal and has stated that the &quot; withdrawal had not been definitely decided upon.&quot;In these circumstances, I do not think the responsibility for asking for further credits from Parliament ought to fall upon me, and, I consider also that the subject is one which requires early Cabinet attention.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.0162384The Wae Office,19th April, 1920.(B20/188)   100  4/20   H&amp;S  8148woj
