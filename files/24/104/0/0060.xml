Employment of women at night is already prohibited under our law in all mines, quarries, factories and workshops, but is not prohibited in certain classes of works to whioh the Convention also applies, viz. works of sonstruotion, works (other than mines and quarries) for extraction of minerals from the earth, and works in which articles are broken up or demolished.    It is probable that there is little if any employment of women at night in these work, but in order to enable the British Government to ratify the Convention it is necessary formally to prohibit it.The Bill also contains a provision to allow the continuance of the two-shift system of employment for women in factories and workshops.     Before the War women could only be employed during one period of twelve hours, which had to be the same for all the women in the factory or workshop.    During the War the system of employing women on two consecutive shifts of approximately eight hours each was introduced in order to increase production and lessen the strain on the women, and is being continued during the period of reconstruction under the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act.     The system is cne which many employers desire to introduce as a part of their permanent arrangements in view-of the general reduction of hours to eight in the day, as by this means they would be enabled to maintain or increase the level of production and at the same time to reduce its cost.     The system was recommended for the favourable consideration of the Government by the Reconstruction Committee on Employment of women after the War, and I think it is very desirable that it should not be allowed to drop when the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Aot oomes to an end next August.April. 87th,1920.
