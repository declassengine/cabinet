/ 3Referred toCommittee of Home Affairs 144r,S gOgUtejg IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAim 10 MAJESTY&apos;S QOVSRNMENT,MtHo16of^fT^5^   PROPOSED   DENTISTS   REGISTRATION   BILL./JfJ/fMemorandum by the Minister of Health,I have to ask the consent of the Home Affairs Committee to the introduction of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on the Dentists Act, 1878, which reported in 1919.    The Committee found that grave injury to public health results from the fact that under the existing Act it is open to anyone without even a minimum of training to practise dentistry, provided that he refrains from calling himself a &quot;dentist&quot; or &quot;dental surgeon&quot;*    The Committee accordingly recommended that legislation should be introduced to prohibit unregistered and unqualified persons from practising dentistry and performing operations on the mouth; but in order not to prejudice the legitimate interests of the present unregistered dentists, they proposed that, subject to proper safeguards, bona fide unregistered practitioners should be admitted to the register, a special body being appointed to scrutinise the claims of unregistered dentists before admission to the register.     The Committee also proposed to provide for the admission of certain dental mechanics after a shorter period of training than is at present required to qualify for the degree of L.D*S-* the degree required at   present as a condition of registration,....I therefore recommend the introduction of legislation to give effect to these recommendations of the Departmental-Committee.     The Bill will provide that after a prescribed date no person shall practise dentistry unless he is a registered medical practitioner or dentist, except that in emergency a simple extration
145extraction without anaesthetics may be carried out by an unregistered person.    The case for legislation is so strong and the interests of bona fide unregistered dentists are so fully safeguarded, that I do not anticipate opposition to the Bill, and I hope that by improving the status of the profession, it will become more attractive and will secure a better flow of recruitsiThe number of dentists now on the register and of unqualified men who would be entitled to be registered under the Bill is barely sufficient to meet existing needs, and for this and other reasons the Departmental Committee went rather beyond their terms of reference and recommended the establishment of a system of scholarships, with State subsidies, to increase the flow of recruits.    They also recommended that Local Health Authorities should be empowered to establish public dental clinics.    These recommendations are important, but in nty view, they ought to be considered in conjunction with other public health questions as part of the comprehensive scheme for the re-organisation of public health services which is the corollary ot the establishment of one central health authority, the Ministry of Health.    I therefore prop6se that the Bill should be limited strictly to questions&apos; of registration.    The control of the Dental Register is vested in the General Medical Council, and therefore there is a single Register for the whole of the United Kingdom. I have consulted the Scottish Board of Health and the Chief Secretary,, and it is proposed that the Bill should apply to the whole of the United Kingdom,The expenses incidental to the maintenance of the Register are met from fees, and the Bill will therefore not impose any charge upon the Exchequer.MINISTRY OP HEALTH.
