[This Bocoaoni is to Propel; *f His Britannic Majesty^ Government..]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1920.CONFIDENTIAL.D- Li 1,1Z     )*J^JJ IMPERIAL EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY.[emorandum by Sir L. Worthington Evans and Lieutenant-ColonelL. S. Amery.IN continuation of the memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (CP.-846) of the 11th March, we wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to two papers on the problem of Imperial Exchange and Currency which, at our invitation, have been written by Mr. J. F. Darling, a Managing Director of the London Joint City and Midland Bank, and by Major Ewart Grogan. Without endorsing all the views expressed in these papers in every detail, we venture to submit that they deserve the most careful study of the Cabinet both for their critical analysis of the present exchange situation and for their constructive suggestions.The present disorganisation of the exchanges within the British Empire has already created a serious situation from which every part of the Empire suffers, and none is really a gainer. The most serious single factor in this disorganisation has been the rise in the Indian rupee, culminating in the decision of the India Office and Government of India to cut the rupee adrift from sterling altogether, and to link it up to the gold or dollar exchange, at the same time revising its ratio to gold from 15 to 10 rupees to the sovereign. This decision appears to have given serious dissatisfaction in India itself, where it is being misrepresented as a deliberate device to subsidise British imports into India at the expense of Indian industries, and to augment the pay of Anglo-Indian officials and pensioners. In that aspect the matter is, of course, entirely within the responsibility of the Government of India, undoubtedly a grave one at this time of general unrest. But the decision has had effects of an even more serious character outside of India. By putting India on a gold basis and divorcing it from sterling, an element of fluctuation and uncertainty, seriously hampering to trade, has been intro-duced into all the trade relations between India on the one side, and the United Kingdom and the greater part of the Empire on the other. Meanwhile, trade with America and Japan, the latter our chief competitor in the Indian market, is fostered by being on a permanently stable basis. From the economic point of view India has, in fact, been deliberately annexed to the United States and Japan, and the strength of her export trades instead of being of avail to help redress our adverse balance with America, acts on the other side of the scale to depress our exchange unnecessarily and to increase the burden of our external debt. At the same time the height to which the Indian exchange has been raised, which, under normal conditions of competition in the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs, would operate in reduction of India&apos;s exports, at present simply operates to increase the price of foodstuffs and raw materials in this country. These unfortunate effects have, of course, been even more acutely felt in those parts of the British Empire which are more completely dependent on Indian supplies than the United Kingdom. In the Malay States, Fiji, and other parts of the British Empire in the East which are on a sterling basis the effect has been to add heavily to the already exorbitant price of rice and other necessaries drawn from India, and to create an acute industrial and social crisis. Other colonies, like Ceylon or Mauritius, are so closely linked up with India that it has been impossible to cut them loose from the rupee, with the result that existing industries are seriously hampered in marketing their produce, except where they can compel the British consumer to bear the extra cost, and the flow of capital for their development checked. In British Somaliland the rise in the rupee is calculated in the current financial year to add  87,000 to the grant-in-aid, which will have to be paid by the British taxpayer. In East Africa, which hitherto has been on a rupee basis and whose development has been gravely prejudiced by the rise in the rupee, it was found impossible to restore the old rate of exchange, but the situation has been saved, to some extent at least, by
stabilising the rupee at 21- sterling, the loss being thus divided between the white settlers, who sell their produce here and whose capital is reckoned in terms of sterling, and the Indian community who owe money in India or have to buy Indian goods.The rise of the Canadian exchange against us has, of course, also contributed to the high cost of living in this country. But in so far as the Canadian exchange has begun to drop something like 15 0/0 below the American, the effect, though hardly appreciable on the cost of living here, has undoubtedly been to stimulate both Canada&apos;s home production and export trade and to furnish a very appreciable additional preference to British imports into Canada. The advantages of this state of affairs are, we believe, being increasingly realised by Canadian -business men, so that it is by no means impossible that Canada might come to consider it in her interest to break away entirely from New York and link up her dollar with sterling at a rate well below New York, say at 5 dollars to the pound sterling. In South Africa the exchange, in spite of the serious leakage of gold coin out of the country, has been kept at or near sterling, and a realisation of the disaster in which all the poorer gold mines as well as the other promising export industries of the country would be involved by a rise of the South African exchange to anything like a .y;old basis has led to the adoption of a scheme for the substitution of gold currency by ultimately convertible notes. This scheme, devised by a Mr. Strakosch, is based on the idea of a central note-issuing bank only doing business with other banks and issuing notes partly against gold but mainly against bills of exchange, and would fit in naturally with the scheme for a Central Empire Bank outlined in Mr. Darlings memorandum. But there is always a danger of short-sighted banking and importing interests combining to pull South Africa away from sterling, and the same might at any time happen in Australia where the banks have hitherto kept the exchange at par with sterling.The confusion and instability of the exchanges within the Empire are, of course, only a part of the wider problem of the chaos in the world&apos;s exchanges. But for our purposes it is much the most important part. The resources of the Empire are so great and so varied that any measure which enables the whole Empire to act as one for exchange purposes by that very fact enormously steadies the exchanges of each part with the outside world. Moreover, in so far as we in the United Kingdom import foodstuffs and raw materials from within the Empire, we reduce the adverse balance of trade against us, while our exchange is raised with America and the rest of the outside world by what other parts of the Empire export to them as well as by our own exports. And as our exports are largely of a class which America deliberately keeps out by her tariff while she eagerly imports the rubber, jute, tin, vegetable oils, long staple cotton and other products of the Empire, the importance of this aspect of the problem is obvious.Whether, as a matter of fact, it is desirable to restore our exchanges with America and the metallic standard world too rapidly is another question. Our low exchange in the United Kingdom is, at this moment, acting as a most effective protection to our home industries and as a stimulus to our export trade, and is enabling us to undersell the United States in every market. A low exchange between the British Empire and the outside world would similarly act as a tremendously strong stimulus to inter-Imperial trade and Imperial development and constitute a most effective and politically non-contentious form of Imperial preference. Again, as Major Grogan suggests, a relatively low exchange would make it much easier for the British Empire to supply food and raw materials to Europe and help it on its feet. For all these reasons it would probably be desirable while aiming at restoring the Empire exchange to the old gold basis eventually, more particularly with a view to paying off our debt to America, not to be in too great a hurry to make this our immediate object, but to aim at keeping the exchanges wrell below gold parity for the period of Imperial reconstruction and development immediately ahead of us.In any case the Imperial part of the general exchange problem is the part which it is within our power to take in hand and set right. Exchange is a political as well as an economic problem. There can be no fluctuation of exchange between two areas, however different their conditions,or whatever the direction of the flow of commodities between them, where the same monetary token or unit of value is recognised by the administration and the courts as legal tender or of the same statutory value. There is nO exchange fluctuation between Halifax and Vancouver, 4,000 miles apart, or between England and West Africa, in the one case because there is the same legal tender over the whole area, in the other because the West African Currency Board, by agreement of the Governments concerned, always supplies exchange at par. The economic problem under such conditions adjusts itself in an innumerable variety of minor ways.   All, then,
that is required to secure stability of exchange within the Empire is an agreement to that effect between the Governments concerned. And such an agreement is obviously far more easily secured with the other Governments of the Empire than with foreign Governments.There are several possible solutions of the problem. But in the existing constitution of the Empire they must all provide against one possible danger inherent in any fixed system of exchange not controlled by a single central Government, namely, the danger of one part of the Empire depreciating the exchange and currency of the rest of the Empire by its own currency inflation. That implies some automatic limitation on the extent to which exchange is given, or a common medium of exchange put into circulation. In Mr. Darling&apos;s scheme this limitation is secured by the provision that the proposed Central Exchange Bank of the Empire should only issue its Imperial notes against short-dated self-liquidating bills of exchange. Major Grogan suggests a conversion by agreement of the existing note issues of the Empire into an Imperial note, to be recognised everywhere as legal tender at the agreed parity of exchange, and maintaining that parity by the very fact that it could, like gold, be shipped from one part of the Empire to another to correct the balance of trade. ]Iis scheme savours a little of inflation, wliile Mr. Darling&apos;s, as he himself admits, may err on the side of restriction. A possible compromise which suggests itself is the conversion by agreement of a fixed percentage of existing note issues, say, 25 or possibly even 50 70* to be then supplemented according to the growth of inter-Imperial trade by the further issue of notes limited by the volume of bills of exchange.In any case the problem is one of the greatest importance and urgency, and we venture to suggest that a financial conference of the Empiie should be summoned at the earliest possible moment to deal with it, and that even before this is done an attempt should be made to see whether the Government of India, in view of the&apos; unpopularity in India of its present policy as well as of its anti-Imperial character, might not be persuaded, without waiting for such a conference, to fix the rupee at 2/-sterling instead of 2/- gold, until such time as sterling can be brought back to its old gold parity.L. WORTHINGTON EVANS. L. S. AMEBY.March 31, 1920.Annexure A.Suggestions for an Empire Currency and an Empire Bank.Memorandum by Mr. J. F. Darling.Probably the greatest disorganizing factor in the American Exchange is the large debt we owe to the United States, and it is of the first importance that as a solvent, although temporarily embarrassed, State we should boldly face the situation. The interest on this debt should be paid regularly and not funded, even for a short time, and arrangements should be made for redemption of principal within a reasonable period. It was stated in Parliament that our debt in February of this year to the American Government was  865,000,000 and to other United States creditors  120,000,000. Together in round figures  1,000,000,000. But the debt is a dollar debt, and so it makes a vast difference to the British taxpayer, both as regards principal and interest, at what rate of exchange payment is effected.While this debt to America must be borne by the British taxpayer, much might be done with the Empire&apos;s co-operation to lighten greatly the sterling equivalent of the burden. May I therefore suggest whether the time has not come for the Government of the Mother-country to take counsel,with the different Governments of the Empire to see whether some plan cannot be devised to bring the British Empire closer together in the production and interchange of goods ? The result would doubtless be that not only would the payment of the debt to America be facilitated, but there would be such a stimulus given to production and interchange as would mutually benefit bqth the Empire as a whole and the world at large.The absolute necessity of Empire co-operation is brought very prominently forward in ,the currency measures which the Government of India on the recommendation pf
the Indian Currency Committee have just adopted. The terms of reference to the committee are confined to India alone and contain no mention of the effect of changes upon the rest of the Empire. And so we have produced the strange anomaly not only of the rupee being nominally based on gold, which sooner or later disappears into India&apos;s hoards, but of the par of exchange of India, which still forms part of the British Empire, being detached from sterling, on which the bulk of the Empire&apos;s transactions are conducted, and attached to the American dollar. We thus have two results which are detrimental not only to the rest of the Empire but to India herself. The one is that the sterling rupee exchange will fluctuate wildly with the sterling dollar exchange, and may even take some excursions on its own account; and the other, that, instead of a sterling par of 2/- which conditions seem to warrant, the rupee is roughly at 2/8, and thus the price of lndia&apos;s products to the rest of the Empire will be greatly increased. That cannot be for the benefit of either India or the Empire. It is little wonder that Indian trade has been disorganized and that the mercantile community in India are crying out at the prospects before them.The Indian Commission gave considerable attention to this question of a gold or sterling basis for the rupee, but in deciding on gold they took the wrong turning, though not without certain misgivings, for they console themselves with the thought that the adverse conditions will anyhow &quot; only exist until the jjold basis of the British currency is restored.&apos;&apos; Such a statement however is not practical politics. Were &quot; the gold basis of the British currency restored &quot; our special difficulties caused by the disorganization of the exchange would be at an end. But there is much work to be done and much time must elapse ere we reach that consummation. Meanwhile India, instead of helping us to reach it, actually introduces legislation which puts&apos;obstacles in our way. It raises the price of her products against us. and by her action tends to lower further the pound sterling as against the dollar, and increases the sterling burden of that debt to America which Great Britain incurred so that India, with the rest of the Empire, might be free.   To speak plainly, this is not business.Canada, too, has her special difficulties with American exchange, her dollar being at a discount of some 12% compared with the United States dollar. She is thus between two stools. Her imports from the United States are hampered on the one hand, and on the other her exports to the other parts of the Empire lose a portion of the benefit they would receive -were Canada on a sterling basis. If, as the result of a conference, she saw fit to come in with the rest of the Empire on a sterling basis she would be able to render special assistance in liquidating the debt to America, and would doubtless also find that in so doing her own development had been greatly stimulated.The resources of the Empire, already great, are capable of much greater develop-ment, and it is through this development and in the economic handling of what is produced that we can in time redeem our debt to America, This can be effected by the double process of increasing inter-Empire trade and thus buying less from foreign countries, and in increasing the EinphVs exports to foreign countries and especially to the United States. The necessarv adjustments, as between the different parts of the Empire, can be settled internally as we shall show.But before we can reap the advantage of closer co-operation it is of the first importance that the Empire should possess a sound and, as far as possible, a uniform system of currency, it is with some diffidence that the writer brings forward his ideas, but they have occupied his mind and undergone development during the past three years, and are the result of sonie practical experience spread over a considerable time and gained through contact with different parts of the Empire. It is hoped that the suggestions may anyhow form a basis for discussion.In considering a uniform system of currency for the British Empire at the present time we must adapt ourselves to the new conditions with which we are confronted. A basis for currency may conform to past theory, but if it is neither practical nor workable for us under the changed economic conditions caused by the wars upheaval, we must endeavour to find some other basis. This is surely the case in regard to gold and silver. Their sources of supply are at all times uncertain and subject to great changes; on the other side we have to contend with the insatiable demands of the East. These demands are ineradicable and in a greater or lesser degree have always to be reckoned with.For the five years immediately before the war India&apos;s absorption of gold was nearly  20,000,000 per annum. As( the Currency Report points out, India has a large favourable trade balance and can therefore demand payment in any form she chooses. In the long run we would be unable, nor would it be politic, to withhold from her the gold and silver she desires, provided she is prepared to pay the price.   But this is
surely just one of the reasons why these metals should not also be used as a basis, or anyhow as a primary basis, for the Empire&apos;s credit and currency systems.At the present time we are seeking for a basis for currency which will assist the Empire, not so much years hence when things get settled down, but here and now when we are struggling to reconstruct and produce and pay our debts. For this purpose, were gold ever so stable, it is not a practical basis because there is not enough available to go round and the price is too high.Fortunately we have an instrument at hand the supply of which is largely determined by the actual movement and prices of a mass of different commodities the self-liquidating bill of exchange payable in London. It is necessary to distinguish between the bill created on pure credit and that drawn against a movement of goods from one country to another. The former we eliminate and even in the latter it is desirable to limit the time the bill has to run to three months and to avoid renewals. But within these limits a currency system based upon bills of exchange is really based upon a mass of different commodities in course of movement, at current prices, and in the majority of cases, actually sold, so that the bill can be easily met at maturity.As it is proposed that the bills of exchange should form the primary basis for the Empire&apos;s currency, it would probably be desirable to limit them to those drawn against a movement of commodities (a) from one part of the Empire to another, (b) from a part of the Empire to a foreign country, (c) from a foreign country to a part of the Empire.London is still pre-eminently the centre for bills of exchange and possesses the experience for successfully handling them and for discrimination.With a currency system based on self-liquidating bills of exchange there would scarcely be room for inflation, for over so large an area as the British Empire the currency would automatically expand and contract with the movement of goods and of prices, for on that movement it would be based. The question however arises whether there would be produced sufficient bills of exchange of the character described to provide a wide enough basis for the credit and currency systems of the Empire. This leads us to consider the desirability of creating a Central Bank for the Empire, not to compete with other hanks in ordinary banking business, but to be the banker of Governments and of banks, with a central office in London and offices established throughout the Empire. If all banks and financial houses &quot;banked with the Empire Bank it would hold the banking reserves of the Empire, thus forming a pool into which all cheques large and small would ultimately be cleared. We shall then see that very important results could be secured, including a great economy in the use of credit in the Empire and the speeding-up of our credit machinery, which by diminishing the demand would probably result in the basis afforded by self-liquidating bills of exchange being found sufficient.In considering how an Empire Bank of this description would economise credit and greatly speed up our credit machinery let us for the moment leave the foreign exchanges to look after themselves, and defer consideration of the effect of movements of currency  both of which will be dealt with later and concentrate upon cheques, with which practically all large transactions and many small ones are settled. There is a very simple formula which it is necessary always to keep in mind-that every debit involves a credit and vice versa.   So far as Britain is concerned this takes place (a.) In the same office of a bank in cases where both the drawer of the cheque and the receiver keep their accounts in that office. In that case the cheque does not go outside the office, but the account of the drawer is debited and the account of the receiver credited by a simple transfer.(b.) In different offices of the same bank where the accounts of the drawer and receiver are kept at. different offices. In that case the cheque would be sent by office A, at which the receiver keeps his account, to the head office, and through the banks internal clearing there it would be forwarded to office B, on which the cheque is drawn. But the net result is that the receivers account at office A is credited and the drawer&apos;s account at office E debited. In the process office A in the books at the head office is credited and office B debited, but that only means that office A has so much more balance with the head office and office B so much less. The banks cash reserves are left unaltered.(c.) In offices of different banks where the accounts of the drawer and receiver are not kept with the same bank. Here bank A, where the person who receives the cheque keeps his account, sends it to the clearing-house, of which bank B on whom the cheque is drawn, or their agent, is a member.
In the clearing-house the cheque is handed to bank B and through the Bank of England, where both banks or their clearing agents keep accounts,, the transactions are settled, bank A being credited and bank B debited in the books of the Bank of England (of course it is the balance of the clearing which is actually credited and debited, the other transactions cancelling one anotherh In consequence bank A&apos;s balance with the Bank of England may be increased and that of bank B diminished, but the aggregate balances of the bankers with the Bank of England is not directly affected by the transaction.Let us now carry the process further and assume a Central Bank for the Empire with a central office in London and offices throughout the Empire ; that all banks in the Empire keep an account with the Empire Bank at the central office and at the office in the country where the individual bank is located ; and that one of the functions of the Empire Bank is to issue cable transfers to its banking clients at par between the central office and any other office. Further that the figures of each office are wired weekly to the central office and incorporated in the weekly balance-sheet issued by the Empire Bank.In the different parts of the Empire what may be termed the local cheque transactions would be settled in the manner described either direct or through the office of the Empire Bank in the district. But the aggregate of the bankers&apos; balances would not be directly altered in consequence.   The pool would remain intact.But it is in inter-Empire transactions that we would have the most important results. For all inter-Empire trade settled by cheque would be dealt with in a similar way and that wuthout any movement in the aggregate balances of the banks with the Empire Bank, for here again it is a matter of transfer a debit and a credit.If, for example, A in London wishes to remit to B in Montreal and A&apos;s banker finds it necessary to apply to the Empire Bank for a cable transfer, the transfer resolves itself into this, that A&apos;s bankers account with the Empire Bank in London is debited and B&apos;s bankers account with the Empire Bank in Montreal is credited. But the aggregate of bankers&apos; balances with the Empire Bank is unaltered, and the level of the pool remains the same,   sOr again, if bank A in South Africa wishes to remit to bank B in Australia, it applies to the Empire Bank in South Africa for a cable transfer, and the transaction is effected by a diminution of bank A&apos;s balance with an office of the Empire Bank in South Africa and an increase of bank 5&apos;s balance with an office of the Empire Bank in Australia. But the aggregate of bankers&apos; balances with the Empire Bank is left unaltered.Nor would one-sided trade in a part of the Empire interfere with this result.Suppose, for example, that at a time when imports to Australia are small Australia is a large exporter of wheat. The Bank of Australasia makes a loan on wheat. Its customer sells the wheat to an exporter, who banks with the Bank of New South Wales, Sydney, and who ships the wheat to London, and he sells his bill on London to that bank. The transaction is settled in the first instance by a transfer, through the clearing, the Bank of Australasia being credited, and the Bank of New South Wales debited, in the books of the Empire Bank in Sydney. The Bank of New South Wales sends the bill to London where it is met by the miller giving his cheque on the London Joint City and Midland Bank. In the books of the Empire Bank in London the Bank of New South Wales is credited, and the London Joint City and Midland debited. But the Bank of New South Wales has paid out in Sydney and has received in London and wishes to return its funds. It applies for a cable transfer to the Lmpire Bank. All that then passes is that the Bank of New South Wales&apos; account in the books of the Empire Bank, London, is debited and that in the books of the Sydney office credited.Or the Bank of New South Wales in London may find it more profitable for a time to keep the proceeds of the bill in London and lend it in the money market there again a transfer. As a matter of fact surplus moneys which the banks, no matter where situated, could not employ locally would tend to come to London. And they would do so with the greatest freedom because the banks would know that at any time they could obtain a transfer at par from the Empire Bank either to their own part of the Empire or to any other part where the Empire Bank had an office.These results are very important and must greatly assist inter-Empire trade.   It means that inter-Empire exchanges would be practically done away with, and that in the Empire there would be no relative scarcity of money in one part and plethora in, another, for money would immediately go to where it is most wanted.
We will now consider the foreign exchanges. If the Empire will only enter into the close co-operation which we are contemplating there would doubtless, as we have said, be a great stimulus to inter-Empire trade. The rate of exchange would practically not require to enter into the calculations on which that trade is based. The pound sterling would be universal all the Empire over. There would be some slight difference between buying and selling pounds sterling as between one part of the Empire and another, sufficient to compensate the banks for handling the business, but as the banks could always obtain telegraphic transfers backwards and forwards from the Empire Bank, exchange fluctuations would in effect be eliminated. When we consider how great an area of the world the British Empire covers; how already within that area there are produced many of the things the Empire wants and how with economic handling production is capable of indefinite expansion, we can see how important the inter-Empire trade is likely to become. But if inter-Empire exchanges become practically eliminated, it follows that the Empire&apos;s exchange with the rest of the world becomes in effect uniform on the basis of cable transfers. For example, the rate for cable transfers Cape Town on New York would within the narrowest margin be the same as Montreal on New York, otherwise a bank in Cape Town would at once apply to the Empire Bank for a cable transfer on Montreal and remit from there and vice versa.We thus arrive at a further important result, that if the sterling exchange is favourable it is favourable for the whole Empire and if it is unfavourable it is unfavourable for the whole Empire. Again remembering what are the potentialities of the Empire in relation to the rest of the world the Empire would depend more and more on its own resources and buy less from foreign countries with which its exchange was unfavourable. Similarly the Empire&apos;s exports to those foreign countries would be stimulated. The demand for commodities the world over is urgent and the discount of about 30% at which sterling dollar exchange stands would prove a powerful stimulus when applied not merely to a manufacturing area but to a very considerable portion of the globe rich in developed and undeveloped raw materials likely to remain for a long time in urgent demand. That this would prove a remedy, and perhaps a speedy remedy, for the exchanges seems indisputable.We shall now go back to the effect of foreign exchange transactions on the pool held by the Empire Bank and here again we shall see it is a matter of transfer. An exchange transaction with New York, for example, involves a buyer of dollars and a seller of sterling and a buyer of sterling and a seller of dollars. The Empire Bank system is only directly concerned with the sterling end of the transaction which is settled by a cheque and results in the seller of sterling&apos;s bank having so much more balance with the Empire Bank, and the buyer&apos;s bank so much less. But the aggregate of banker&apos;s balances is unaltered and the level of the pool remains unchanged. The sterling-dollar exchange will fluctuate according to the Empire&apos;s command of dollars in New York, and we have shownhow through co-operation that, command can be greatly increased. The trade of the whole Empire, especially with the exchange at a heavy discount, would in effect be concentrated on obtaining a command of dollars.But if all these transactions local, inter-Empire, foreign-can be settled without raising or lowering the level of the pool constituted by all bankers&apos; balances in the hands of an Empire Bank, what is left to cause that level to rise or fall ? The answer is, when a banker considers his cash reserves too small. He would then go to the Empire Bank with bills for discount and thus increase his balance. There would under the system be no discredit in so doing; on the contrary, it would form one of the ordinary functions of a banker.There are two factors which would operate to cause the level of the pool to move. One when a bankers loans increase. A loan made by a bank either pays off another loan with that bank or with some other; or increases the deposits with that bank or with some other. The aggregate deposits are thus increased and consequently the banker is desirous to maintain his percentage of cash- 150/0 or whatever it may be  which he considers it is prudent he should hold.But here again it is necessary to keep well in mind the variety and extent of the British Empire ; how its harvests for example come at different times ; how spring and autumn occur simultaneously; and how the trade demands vary slackness at one season in one part being set off against activity in another. When a demand for loans arises in one part, loans are being paid off in another. When one bank considers its cash too small another may have a surplus. And how through the system of cable transfers at par this increase on the one hand and falling off on the other in the demands for money would be concentrated in London, and through the machinery of
the London Money Market, which would become still more important, these fluctuations would be set off the one against the other with great rapidity. This is what we mean by a speeding-up in our credit machinery.Another factor which would disturb the level of the pool would be an increase in the demand for currency. But here again the size and variations of the Empire would mean that there would be an inflow in parts at a time when there would be an outflow in other parts. So that the general level of currency notes in circulation throughout the Empire would probably not produce so great a movement as might be expected.We shall next deal with the nature of the currency. We leave out gold which, as we have seen, is not practical at the present time either as currency or as a basis  anyhow a primary basis for credit or currency ; it is debatable whether it is even desirable. But when the pound sterling again reaches gold level the question of gold can be taken up afresh. What we are concerned with is to raise the pound sterling to gold level, and the most effective way to that end does not appear to be through joining in the scramble for gold.The sterling currency note of the Empire Bank, would, as we have seen, have behind it a great mass of commodities, raw materials, manufactured goods produced in the British Empire or being consigned to the British Empire; goods in demand as is evident by their being in course of movement; goods valued at current prices, and in many cases actually sold in the part of the Empire or foreign country to which they are consigned. In addition, the relative bills of exchange in which the title to these goods is concentrated would bear the names of two good British banks, and the bills would have not more than three months to run.The note of the Empire Bank which would be that of the whole British Empire  with this extremely liquid form of security behind it is one for which we do not require to apologize, or to make convertible into any form of coin. What we have to arrange for is to make the coin of the Empire convertible into notes, which would be the primary currency.We shall now consider how, under the proposed system, the bill of exchange would act upon the note circulation and we shall see that compared with the system in operation at the Bank of England there is a wide and fundamental difference.At present when bills are taken to the Bank of England tor discount, bankers&apos; balances are increased by a corresponding amount, but the reserve of notes is left unaltered. The Bank of EnglamTs liabilities are thus increased and the ratio of reserve to liabilities is lowered.Under the proposed system the bills of exchange (of the character previously described) would be transferred from the Banking Department to the Issue Department and a corresponding amount of notes created, which would be transferred to the reserve of the Banking Department. While therefore the bankers&apos; balances would be increased by the proceeds of the bills of exchange, the reserve would also be increased by a corresponding amount, and the ratio of reserve to liabilities would be raised. As the bills matured the reverse process would take place so that there would be no prolonged period of expansion unless legitimate trade demands warranted it. The bills of exchange through which the expansion would take place would represent that particular class of business, the movement of goods, which is what the Empire to-day most urgently desires.If arrangements were arrived at with the Bank of England whereby it became the foundation of the proposed Empire Bank, there would also be available over  100,000,000 of gold in the Issue Department. But the rise and fall in the note circulation would depend, at least until gold parity were reached, not upon gold, but upon bills of exchange.Under the new system there could scarcely be inflation though conceivably there might be at times insufficient currency. This however would tend to correct itself as it would lead to a further movement of goods, and a creation of more bills in order to supply the deficiency. There is also the counteracting effect of the speeding-up of our credit machinery in the manner already described.A political question for the Imperial Conference to consider would be whether the notes of the Empire Bank should go into actual circulation throughout the Empire or wmile nominally being legal tender, be used in place of gold in the reserves against an expansion of the existing currency issues. This latter would mean a minimum of interference with existing arrangements. But whichever decision was arrived at on the question, it would apparently be necessary to place some restrictions on what may be termed the local note issues. Not in Britain only but in other parts of the Empire as well, there has been a great increase in the note circulations and inflation is supposed to be more or less general.
A line should therefore be drawn beyond which the local currencies should not be allowed to go unless with a backing of Imperial notes, assuming this method and not direct circulation to be adopted. But even then it is conceivable that the local currencies might prove to be in excess. We would propose therefore to test this by giving banks the option to tender local currencies to the Empire Bank to be funded into long-dated loan certificates to be issued by a body representing the Empire and to be called, let us say, Empire War Debt Commissioners. (Their functions we would hope might yet be extended to cover the consolidation of the whole of the Empire War Debt. But this is beyond the scope of the present scheme.) These loan certificates would bear a low rate of interest perhaps 3 0/0-but would be free of all taxes in any part of the Empire. The Empire Bank would also be prepared to advance upon them although at a higher rate of interest than for discounting self-liquidating bills of exchange. It should be noted in passing that the effect of loaning on these certificates, would be very different from discounting bills of exchange, for a loan would mean an increase in the bankers&apos; balance with no increase in the Empire Bank&apos;s reserve, whereas the discounting of bills of exchange would, as we have seen, mean an increase in the reserve.These Empire loan certificates would stand in the very forefront of securities in the Empire ; they would have the whole British Empire behind them; they would be free of taxes all over the Empire ; the market for them would be Empire-wide ; and they would be a security on which the Empire Bank would be prepared to advance. They would thus form a security which all banks, discount companies, and financial concerns would desire to hold.To the extent then that banks funded currency notes of the existing issues it would be some evidence that the currency was redundant. But of this the banks would be allowed to be the judges in their respective spheres of operations.Also to the extent of the funding of currency notes and corresponding issue of loan certificates there would be in some degree a transference from active purchasing power in the form of currency to more or less dormant purchasing power in the form of loan certificates. Eor anyhow the larger banks would probably not borrow upon the certificates unless in an emergency, although it would be a great advantage to them to hold them. Of course to the extent that the notes were funded the maximum amount of existing issues would be respectively reduced.To turn now to coin. Anyhow during the reconstruction period, we leave gold out of account, although the sovereign might be kept legal tender throughout the Empire. This, of course, would not operate until the exchanges were restored to gold level. Silver at anything like its present price is too expensive, but a coin of half silver and half alloy might be adopted-The demand lor coin varies very much in different parts of the Empire, and is not even wholly determined by currency requirements. The customs of the natives enter largely into it. Therefore it is proposed that issues of the coin. suggested should not be made for account of the Empire Bank, but for account ol each individual part of the Empire, and that they should be full legal tender only in that part where they are issued. The name of the part of the Empire where it is legal tender would therefore appear on the coin, otherwise it could be uniform.It would probably be found convenient and more economical that the issues of coin should be made through the agency of the Empire Bank, but after payment of all expenses the profit on the issue would be placed to the credit of a fund, to be called the Coin Conversion Fund, in the name of the individual part of the Empire for whose account the issue is made.If the coins in any part of the Empire became redundant the Empire Bank would be prepared to receive them from their customer banks in large round amounts at face value, but charging a commission, and giving in exchange currency notes. The silver in the coins would then be valued at the current market price and held for-the time being in the reserve of the Empire Bank, the difference being debited to the Coin Conversion Fund of the part of the Empire where the coin was redundant. In this way the coin, would be made convertible into notes, which as we have seen would be the primary currency and a parity bridge between coin and notes would be provided. The Empire Bank would be able to dispose of the silver to other parts of the Empire as the demands, for coin arose.The subsidiary coins would only be of limited legal tender and purely local and therefore do not call for convertibility into notes.The legislation which has followed on the adoption of the Indian Currency Committee&apos;s Report renders the position so far as India is concerned somewhat complex.
1.0The productive power of India, already so great, is capable of much greater expansion, and it is important, both for the sake of India and of the Empire, that she should sooner or later be included in the scheme. But the situation there may require further study, and that means delay. Meanwhile a conference representative of the Mother-country, the Self-governing Dominions, and the Crown Colonies and Protectorates could be held, when it should surely be possible to arrive at a plan for a Currency and an Empire Bank for the rest of the Empire, on a basis equitable to all concerned, and in the control of which each part of the Empire would have a share. Later on India might decide to join, or anyhow be affiliated with the system.With regard to the Empire Bank an entirely new institution could be. created, but before doing so it would be most desirable that an effort should be made to use the Bank of England as the foundation. It would, however, probably be found to be politic in that case to change the name from Bank of England to, say, Bank of the British Empire.But the Bank of England belongs to shareholders whereas a bank of the character we are contemplating should be a State institution. The Bank of England shareholders would therefore require to be bought out and the capital held by the different parts of the Empire in proportion to be arranged. (Capital is really not necessary; the responsibility of the Empire would be sufficient.)It may aid in arriving at the proportional interest of the different parts of the Empire if it is kept in mind that the main function of the Bank is co-operative and not to make a profit. A given proportion of the bankers&apos; balances, which would be free of interest, could be lent by the bank to the State in redemption of War Debt at a rate of interest to be agreed upon. But if from other sources, such as the discount of bills of exchange, the profits were small it would be evidence that the machinery set up was working so smoothly and well that discount to a large extent or at a high rate had not been found to be necessary. Further, the expense of establishing and maintaining offices throughout the Empire might be considerable. It is not therefore expected that the profits would be large. What is most urgently desired ib the closer relationship on a practical co-operative basis of the British Empire, towards which end an Empire currency and an Empire Bank would greatly contribute.J. F. Darling.Algiers, March 12, 1920.Annexure B.Imperial Currency and Exchange.Memorandum by Major Ewart Grogan.Every civilised State must have a legislatively defined unit of value, just as it must have a legislatively defined unit of length and of weight.This statutory unit of value is- necessarily some physical entity. It may be a given weight of gold or of silver or it may be a given number of intrinsically worthless notes, unsupported by, and therefore inconvertible to, metallic currency, yet endowed with value by the fact that they are by law made legal tender in payment of debts expressed in terms of their face values.Tins unit of value must be the nucleus of the currency of the State; and such currency must be maintained in subordinance to the statutory unit of value of the day.Thus the statutory unit of value (as the measure of all monetary contracts) and the related currency, whereby such contracts may be in practice completed in accordance with the intention of the law, are deliberately established by legislation and complementary administrative action on the part of each State.So long as the statutory unit of value was the physical constant, gold ; and the unlimited legal tender money of the currency system was composed either of gold coin or of paper or silver readily convertible, in defined relation, to gold ; every monetary contract automatically matured in accordance with the intention of the law.Previous to the shock of war, the currency systems of the entire British Empire were homogeneous in essential principle.
Gold, defined as the British sovereign or (in the case of Canada) the dollar, was the statutory unit of value throughout; and legal tender money was either confined to gold itself, as in the case of the United Kingdom, or was extended to silver token money or notes, rendered by administrative action convertible to gold when required for the adjustment of external obligations as in the cases of India and the West African Colonies.If the statutory unit of value and the dominant- legal tender coin are of the same metal, and import and export of that metal are unrestricted, and conversion of coin to and from metal is free, the currency system works automatically.Wherever there is identity in the statutory unit of value, parity of exchange (beyond the trifling margin of the cost of currency movement) is automatically maintained.During the war, the gold unit of value, perhaps unnecessarily, was lost; and a host of entirely different statutory units of value developed from such various legislative enactments and administrative restrictions of the movement and convertibility of coin and bullion as each State was constrained to impose upon its subjects.It is evident that the war has left the world &quot; short &quot; of foods and raw materials, yet with immensely increased general manufacturing capacity subject to particular readjustment to peace requirements.It is vital, therefore, that tne stimulus inherent in controlled as distinct from, automatic currencies should be concentrated on the production of the vital needs of the world and elaboration of transport facilities, and not allowed to evaporate in unpro-ductive extravagance.Currency inflation, like doses of oxygen, may win the race or merely induce hysteria, according to the judgment with which it is applied.The main purpose of this preliminary dissertation is to show that when gold is lost as the international medium of exchange, and merely remains as a distorted and unstable international measure of value, automatic international adjustment ceases.Without international currency, international trade degenerates into desperate gambling in exchange.There is no precedent in history whereby the present problem can be judged. At the time of the Napoleonic wars all the States of the world were relatively self-sufficient. To-day, with the exception of the United States of America, they are all specialists in primary or secondary production. The industrial States rely on foods brought from the ends of the earth from States where their own currencies have no legal validity.For this reason alone, laissez-faire leads them all to inevitable disaster. Controlled currencies must be controlled by positive action in accordance with defined policy.Classification and consolidation of these varying national statutory units of value are therefore the essential prelude to the resumption of calculable international trading.The utmost possible elimination of the factor of uncertainty is necessary for &quot;&apos;close&quot; trading. In other words, assured parity of exchange acts as a directive stimulus of business between States, because it eliminates the financial middleman and thus enables &quot; close &quot; prices combined with the full advantage of price to buyer and: seller.The key to the whole problem vests in the British Empire, because the establishment of a common statutory unit of value throughout the Empire is a political possibility.If, for example, the entire State note issues of the Empire could be consolidated into one Imperial   note issue under the control of an Imperial Currency Board, and that   note were made the statutory unit of value in all the component States of the Empire and thereby enabled to function throughout the Empire as the extinct sovereign originally functioned, parity of exchange throughout the Empire would be assured, and the use of gold in Imperial inter-State settlements would be obviated.This assured parity of exchange would act as a terrific and &quot; politically unobjectionable&quot; system of Imperial preference, and the entire gold resources of the Empire would become available for the regulation of the extra-Imperial exchanges.The Empire would develop rapidly towards economic self-sufficiency, and with its marshalled gold resources could appreciate or depreciate at will the unit of value in the free-gold countries. It could, in tine, lift sterling to gold, .or depress gold to sterling at will, because of the ultimate dependence of the free-gold countries upon the resources and opportunities of the Empire.
The main result would be classification of the world&apos;s varying units oi value into three mam categories, namely : 1. Free gold or silver comprising United States of America, Japan, China, Spain,South America. 2. Imperial sterling. The British Empire.3. The &quot; also ran&quot; comprising all the States that have lost the free-gold or silver standard and cannot combine politically to establish a common statutory unit of value inter se, or adopt gold or sterling.Exchange between any one of the States in group 1, and any other of the States in group 2, would be identical, and exchange between any of the States in either group would remain at par.There would thus be an immense simplification of the existing position.any of the States in group 3 would continue to vary indefinitely; and exchange between any of the States in group 3 with group 11 or group 2 would continue to vary indefinitely, but such variation would be identical for all the States in group 1 or in group 2.Imperial sterling would become the clearing-house through which the variant units of group 3 would endeavour to make contact with group 1.it would be possible for the Empire to create additional credit (by extending the note issue) for the purpose of establishing a complete arterial system of communi-cations throughout the Empire; and the assistance which it has been decided in principle to afford to group 3 could be rendered in a form -that would assure the permanent improvement of the world&apos;s economic resources. For example, it would be possible to employ Germany to roll a million tons of rails to open up the undeveloped lands of the Empire and pay her with such Imperial raw materials as are produced in excess of Imperial industrial requirements, measuring the whole transaction in terms of Imperial sterling.Thus the first principle in this suggested policy is the establishment throughout the Empire of a common statutory unit of value to assure parity of exchange throughout the Empire a common gauge for the Empires financial traffic.There are no doubt various means by which this principle could be established. The simplest means would probably be the consolidation of all existing note issues and limitation at the existing amount. The value of the note would inhere in this limitation, and&quot; for immediate Imperial purposes and ultimate international purposes would not necessarily require any metallic backing.The Report of the Committee on Indian currency (C. 7060) of 1893 (p. 26, paragraph 92), cites the classic example of Brazil in the following terms : &quot; The case of Brazil is perhaps the most remarkable of all, as showing that a paper currency without a metallic basis may, if the credit of the country is good, be maintained at a high and fairly steady exchange, although it is absolutely inconvertible and has been increased by the act of Government out of all proportion to the growth of the population and of its foreign trade.&quot;This simple method of consolidation and limitation would have the merit of providing a statutory unit of value that would operate automatically throughout the Empire.There are many alternative methods whereby it could be made ultimately convertible without perceptible shock to the economic system of the Empire.One example will suffice, ft might be arranged that the Imperial Currency Board should extend the issue to finance a complete Imperial scheme of communications. This would be distributed by way of loan among the affected States, and be made payable as to interest and sinking fund either in gold or notes at their current rate of exchange with gold. The notes thus received would be retired, and the gold would go into the reserve. , &apos;&apos;The establishment of this essential principle of a common unit of value throughout the Empire would have been simple at the termination of hostilities, and before the &quot; unpegging &quot; of the exchanges&apos;began.Every moment increasing divergencies between the State units are accumulating, developing in their train vested interests of vast complexity.It might however be achieved if immediate advantage be taken of the general alarm that the chaotic condition of Middle Europe is creating; and especially if an
object lesson can be given by swift arrangement with the Union of South Africa which is now floundering half-way between the sterling and the free-gold units.The greatest political obstacle is the recent decision of the Government of India, but the present rise in sterling might be taken advantage of to unlink India from gold and relink her to sterling. This would secure parity of exchange between India and the United Kingdom, and afford some relief to the burden on Indian industry imposed by the escape of the rupee from control, and the consequent appreciation of the Indian unit of value.The second principle in this suggested policy is that each State&apos;s currency should retain the same relation to the imperial   unit of value that it bore to the British sovereign. The importance of this principle lies in the fact that the depreciation of the unit of value only acts as a stimulus to production if the relation of debtor to creditor is maintained constant in terms of the altering unit of value.The case of India, probably provides an insuperable obstacle to the realisation of this second principle in so far as India herself is concerned.The Indian currency system as defined by the law of 1899 established gold as the unit of value, and a token rupee of unlimited tender to function as the money of use denoting one-fifteenth of  1.The system was automatic in so far as it was calculated to prevent the rupee from rising above 1/4 sterling.Owing to the commandeering of gold by the Imperial Government for war reasons, this automatic control failed, and the rise in the sterling price of silver carried the rupee out of control, since it was not deemed expedient by the Indian Government to apply either of the alternative methods of maintaining the rupee as a token, namely, by an inconvertible note issue or by the diminution of the metallic value of the rupee coin.Recovery of control of the rupee in other words, its resubordination to its original token function was eventually effected by altering its legal relation to the unit of value from the original one-fifteenth to the present one-tenth.Since all Indian monetary contracts are expressed in terms of rupees, this change in the law has the same effect as an appreciation in the Indian statutory unit of value to the extent of 50o/o, and to that extent must act as a check on production. As suggested above, this tendency would be modified by the substitution of Imperial sterling for gold as the Indian unit of value.Admittedly the political difficulty of establishing this second principle is much greater than the difficulty of establishing the first and more vital principle of Imperial parity of exchange.All the States of the Empire have a common interest in establishing the first principle, while the second principle is primarily the domestic concern of each State, although a general Imperial interest, as well as a special domestic interest, is served by the maximum possible stimulation of production.Fortunately the West African Colonies have secured both principles; the East African rupee group has secured the first principle, but for the moment lost the second principle.India has lost both principles, but the power to remedy the position remains with the Imperial Government.Both principles may, perhaps, be secured for the Union of South Africa and her currency satellites, Nyasalancl and Rhodesia, if speedy action is taken.Canada could secure the first principle, but would probably have to fix her dollar in a smaller ratio to the Imperial   than it bore to the sovereign.Both principles could probably be secured for Australia and New Zealand.The following effects would flow from this policy : 1. A rapid movement towards Imperial economic self-sufficiency. 2. A consequent diminution of imports into the Empire from the free-gold and silver countries.3. The elimination of the use of gold in exchange adjustments between the States of the Empire.4. The more complete &quot; clearing&quot; of all transactions between the Empire States and other countries, thus enabling a smaller amount of gold to settle the ultimate trade balance.5. The diminution of the use of gold as Imperial currency with consequent depreciation of the value of gold thus diminishing the hiatus between gold and sterling if and when it may be considered desirable to export gold, rather than to depreciate sterling for the purpose of attracting the capital margins of America to investment in the British Empire.
If this policy be not adopted, the portions of the Empire which are dominantly primary producers must inevitably slip back on to a free-gold plane of costs, which means that their exports of foods and raw materials can only be maintained by a further enormous rise in sterling prices for their products.The congested industrial areas of Europe, including England, will perish politically under a blockade of prohibitive price for all their essential needs.Exact currency is the fly-wheel of modern production; a defect in this adjustment may stop production at the moment of the world&apos;s direst need of the product.No issue so pregnant with catastrophe as this problem of the international exchanges, has ever yet faced the world.Ewart S. Grogan.12th March, 1920.o
