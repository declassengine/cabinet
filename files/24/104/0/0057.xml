This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.m6 ^rnHE CABINET.INTER-ALLIED DEBTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I have read Lord Curzons paper CP. 1093 proposing to wipe off at once all debts owing to us by our allies, principally France, Russia and Italy, irrespective of any similar action taken towards us by the United States. I consider this would be altogether unjustifiable, and would seriously weaken our position in securing a similar release from the United States.It seems to me that a very simple and straightforward policy is open to us. We should declare publicly that we are perfectly ready to wipe out every European debt owing to us if the United States will accord us a similar release from the fifty per cent, smaller sums we owe them. From this position we should not budge. There is no need to be frightened by anti-British propaganda or feeling in the United States so long as we do what is just and right. It will boil up for the election and simmer down afterwards. The Republican Party is much more friendly to this country than the Democratic Party, and although for electoral purposes they may make any points off us which are helpful to them, once they are in power we shall have better relations with them, even than we have had with Mr. Wilson and the Democrats. It is most necessary that we should observe au attitude of cool and calm indifference to electioneering manifestations in the United States. The British Press have been unusually sensible and helpful in this matter and the public have followed their lead.It Avould, I am sure, call forth a violent outbreak of anger in this country if it were known that while we are taxing ourselves more than double as much as the French, we are nevertheless forgiving them their debt, and at the same time allowing the United States, which has already pillaged us of twelve hundred millions of our securities, to continue to exact from us payment to the uttermost farthing of a debt contracted for a common cause.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,23rd April, 1920.*B20/160)  100  4/20 h&amp;8  8160wo
