J      ///ill . Lcr-^lThii Document is thrt Propel/ of^m^^ui.-..^.^-^...........Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.fl&amp; .1109$J^irculate for the information of my colleagues Part L of the Report ofllX%BALL 6^^^omm^ee Presided over by Lord Esher which was appointed last year ^^^s^^i^-^fo examine the administration of the Army in India and other connected questions, together with a copy of a telegram from the Government of India thereon. As the treatment of these other questions will depend on the. decision taken with regard to the higher administration, -Lord Esher has asked to be informed of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on, t, Part I. of the Report, which deals solely with the latter subject, before the.Committee proceed to make recommendations on the rest of the matters referred to lliem.The Report has been critically examined both by the India Office and by the Government of India. Moreover, the majority of the Committee have visited India, where .they had the advantage of hearing from the Viceroy in person his views on their recommendations. I am glad to say that all parties are in substantial agreement in regard to the main principles laid down. The Report is short and clear, and no purpose would be served by summarising it. I propose merely to indicate the points in which some slight modifications or reservations appear to be necessary.The Committee are indisputably right in insisting on the necessity of unity in the supreme direction of the high military policy of the Empire, and in finding the seat of that unity in the Imperial General Staff. On the other hand, the Army in India can in no sense be under the control of the War Office, for by Statute &quot; the superintendence, direction, and control of &quot;the civil and military government of India is vested in the. Goverrior-&quot; General in Council,&quot; who in turn is subject to the superintendence, direction and control of the Secretary of State for India (5 &amp; 6 Geo. V., c. 61, ss. 2 (2) and 33). The Indian Army, in so far as it is paid out of Indian revenues, is as much the property of India as the armies of Australia and Canada are the properties of those Dominions ; and to whatever extent India may, and ought to, be willing, in. higher imperial interests, to place restrictions on her liberty of military action, her rights must be recognised and safeguarded. The Committee^ recommendations must be read in the light of this reservation.The few modifications which I think it necessary to make in accepting and applying the Committee&apos;s recommendations are designed to emphasise the statutory position. Thus, as regards direct communications between the Commander-in-Chief, India, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (para. 2), 1 consider that these should only be allowed on the conditions by which they were restricted when permitted as temporary arrangement during the war. Again, the position of the Secretary in the Military Department requires some further consideration. It is admitted that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff must be the sole responsible military adviser of the Secretary of State on all questions of imperial military policy in which India is concerned, and that the Secretary, Military Department, should for these purposes be a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff. But outside these questions there is a whole range of purely Indian military questions as to which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff can seldom be in a position to /give advice, e.g., the class composition of Indian regiments or the employ-ment of Indians as artillery. To deal with such questions the Secretary of State requires expert Indian advice, and he must be entitled, to obtain it from the Secretary in his Military Department, who should be an officer, not only of Indian experience, but of the Indian Army, appointed by the Secretary of State in consultation with (but not on the recommendation of) * the Army Council.   On these conditions I think that a Military Member ofthe Secretary of State&apos;s Council will no longer be necessary, and I am prepared to dispense with him.The Committee further recommend that the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of the General Staff, India, should be nominated by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.   To this 1 must make a similar reservation.  The 10  1312     100 4.20
Commander-in-Chief should, I think, be appointed by the Secretary of State for War acting in consultation with the Secretary of State for India. The Chief of the General Staff should be appointed, on the recommendation of the Government of India, by the Secretary of State for India acting in consultation with the Army Council, and with their concurrence in the case of a British Service officer.Of course, in ease of a difference &quot;of opinion between the War Office and the India Office the matter must be submitted for the orders of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet. But as regards the position of these officers vis-a-vis of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, it will be quite plain from what I. have already said that in no circumstances Avhatever do they take their orders from that officer or from the War Office; and if these reservations are accepted and fairly worked I do not think ihat with due vigilance on the part of the Secretary of State for India-there is any danger of the Army in India passing out of the statutory control of the Government of India.23rd April 1920.K.

HH&apos;  HICirculated by the Secretary of State for India.REPORTOF THEARMY  IN INDIA COMMITTEE,1919-1920,TERMS OF REFERENCE.1. To enquire into and report, with special reference to post-bellum conditions, upon the administration and, where necessary, the organisation of the Army in India, including its relations with the War Office and the India Office, and the relations of the two Offices to one another.2. To consider the position of the Commander-in-Chief in his dual capacity as head of the Army and member of the Executive Council, and to make recommendations.3. To consider and to report upon any other matters which they may decide are- relevant to the enquiry.
If,REPORTOF THEARMY IN INDIA COMMITTEE, 1919 1920.To the Right Hon. E. S. Montagu, M.P.Sir,In forwarding you the first part of our Report we desire to point out a difficulty with which we are confronted at the outset of our enquiry. We cannot consider the administration of the Army in India otherwise than as part of the total armed forces of the Empire ; yet we have no indication of the form of organization which may be set up in the future for the control of other parts of those forces, or of the whole.We have, it is true, been told that proposals for the higher direction of our Imperial forces are under consideration, and we are aware of the circumstances under which an Imperial Cabinet was formed during the late war. But the bases of permanent Imperial control over the organised forces of the Empire are as yet unlaid, and we have therefore been obliged to take existing statutes and usage as the foundation of the proposals we have made in accordance with the terms of our reference. The remedies which we shall venture to suggest for such defects in the Army in India as may be disclosed in the course of our enquiry will therefore be made subject to the limitations ave have indicated.Novel political machinery created by the Peace Treaty has enhanced the importance of the Army of India relatively to the military forces in other parts of the Empire, and more particularly to those of the British Isles. We feel bound to assume that Western Europe will no longer be an armed camp containing national armies in a high state of preparation for war, and we note that conflicts fraught with the gravest consequences to the belligerent nations cannot in future take place within a few days or weeks of an order to mobilise. We realise, and the evidence of Lord Allen by confirms our belief, that the war has left Eastern Europe and what is commonly known as the Near and Middle East in a condition of grave unrest, with consequences to India, especially as regards her military and financial resources, that we are unable to ignore.We are aware that, during the war, the necessary co-ordination of the fighting strength of the whole Empire brought into existence what has been called an Imperial Cabinet, performing real functions of Imperial Govern-ment, and accepted apparently without demur by the united peoples. The evolution of this novel, constitutional instrument is for the moment arrested. If the principle of an Imperial Cabinet composed of the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and the Dominions becomes rooted in our institutions, other changes connected with Imperial defence seem likely to follow.An Imperial General Staff, an Imperial Naval and an Imperial Air Stall, possibly an Imperial Foreign Office, may become segregated under the leadership of the British Prime Minister of the day, but controlled by a body that from the naturejof the case cannotbe wholly responsible to the Parliament at Westminster. If India were again to be represented directly in a permanent Imperial Council or Cabinet, such as that summoned ad hoc 10  1320     75  4.20 A 2
during the war, the position of her Commander-in-Chief might assume a special aspect different from that which we have had to consider. Desirable and perhaps vital as such an evolution of our institutions may be, the chances of its accomplishment are not immediate. We have, therefore, accepted for the purpose of our Report the relations of India to Great Britain and to the Empire as they stand to-day.We desire also to mention that we have been requested, in considering our recommendations, to avoid, if possible, framing them in such a manner as may hereafter prove inconsistent with the gradual approach of India towards a Dominion status; and we observe that the Indian Constitutional Reforms recently proposed have in view the relaxation of the control of the Secretary of State, as well as of Parliament, over the Government of India.We are at the same time confronted with evidence of the continued reluctance of the India Office to relinquish into the hands of the Government of India greater freedom in the administration of the Army, even in cases where this could be done without compromising the administration of the Army at home or contravening the sound principle of uniformity in military policy. We are strongly of opinion that greater latitude should be allowed to the Governor-General in Council and to the Commander-in-Chief in India in matters affecting internal military administration, in order to secure greater efficiency, and especially the greater contentment of the Army in India.At the same time we lay stress upon the importance of maintaining constant and intimate touch between the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London and between their general staff officers.Taking, then, existing institutions and the present conditions in India as the basis on which to work, we consider that we shall be laying the foundations of a sound Imperial military system, if the plans we propose are consistent (1) with the control by the Government of India of Indian military affairs ;(2) with giving to the Government of India a voice in questions ofImperial defence, and (3) with allowing the Imperial General Staff through its Chief to exercise a considered influence on the military policy of the Governmentof India.Keeping these principles in mind, we propose to submit our Report to you in several parts, and to report on each separately. Part 1. is forwarded herewith, and deals with matters upon which a great mass of evidence already exists in documents laid before us. We have therefore not thought it necessary to travel once more over ground investigated by numerous committees and commissions, and by eminent Viceroys and Commanders-in-Chief in past years.We have limited our enquiry upon these matters to obtaining the views of distinguished soldiers of recent war experience, and we have found that their conclusions are in general agreement with the recorded opinions of Lord Lytton and Lord Kitchener.At the outset of our inquiry it was necessary to decide whether formal evidence should be taken. After consideration we determined that it was undesirable to add to the mass of documentary evidence already available. We consequently decided to take counsel with high officers, military and civil, and certain independent persons whose views and experience could simplify our task, but not to record their evidence formally. We have thus obtained expressions of opinion given with complete freedom, and, coupled with the experience of the members of the committee, they have been of great value to us in forming our conclusions.We desire to remind you that&apos; the subsequent Parts of our Report, dealing as they are bound to do with matters of administrative detail, would be largely influenced by the decision at which you may arrive to accept or reject the proposals we have made in Part I.   So convinced are we of the
desirability of obtaining a decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the principles laid clown in Part 1. before proceeding to the laborious examination of the numerous questions covered by our reference, that we have thought it imperative to place Part I. of our Report in your hands before the committee proceeds to India. It would facilitate the work of the committee, and would render their complete report of greater value to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the Government of India, if we could obtain from you at an early date an indication of the advice you are likely to tender to His Majesty&apos;s Government upon the principal questions covered by Part I. of our Report.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants, ESEER.M. F. 0&apos;DWYER. H. V. COX, Lieut.-Genl. CLAUD W. JACOB, Lieut.-Genl. J. P. Du CANE, Lieut.-Genl. G. FELL.WEBB GILLMAN, Maj.-Genl.C. M. WAGSTAFF, Brig.-Genl., Secretary, 3rd November 19 L9.
PART I.Section I. The India Office.1. The relations between the India Office and the Government of India are presumably based upon the importance of keeping the control of Parliament as.far as possible intact over Indian expenditure. The theory, sound in itself, in view of the bureaucratic form of government in India, has proved to be illusory in practice. The business of Parliament is too great and too complex to enable any effective control to be exercised by the House of Commons over Indian expenditure, in practice, therefore, the control of the India Office has been merely the control of one bureaucracy over another.The working of this system undoubtedly causes delay in dealing with military questions that frequently require rapid settlement, both in the interests of efficiency and of the contentment of the Army in India. We, therefore, recommend that greater latitude should be allowed to the Governor-General in Council in deciding questions of a military character, provided they do not influence by reflex action the adminis-tration of the British Army at home.2. From 1909, and particularly during the war, the rule was relaxed under which all communications of a military nature between the Oommander-in-Ohief and the War Office passed through the India Office. During the war the Commander-in-Chief in India communicated direct with the War Office. We consider that this freedom of communication should now be established as a permanent light on a regular official basis ; but should be limited to communications between the Commander-in-Chief and the Imperial General Staff. The Secretary of State for India should be kept fully informed of such communications.3. In order to facilitate what we consider of primary importance, namely, the free and intimate relation between, the Commander-in-Chief in India and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and in order that the Secretary of State for India should also be fully informed upon all questions of military policy affecting India, we recommend that the Secretary in the Military Department of the India Office should always be an officer with Indian experience, of high military rank, appointed on the recommenda-tion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff by the Secretary of State for India. It would be convenient and desirable that this officer should be a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff in order that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff may have the benefit of experienced advice on Indian matters. Furthermore, he should have the right of attending the meetings of the Army Council when questions affecting India are discussed. Although we strongly advocate that questions of administration regarding the Army in India should be mainly settled in India itself, and should only be referred to the India Office under the circumstances which we have previously noted, we are of opinion that the Secretary in the Military Department of the India Office should have attached to his Department two officers specially conversant with &quot; A &quot; and &quot; Q &quot; questions, in so far as they affect India.4. We are unable to see any advantage, from the point of view of India, in retain-ing upon the India Council in London the services of an officer of high military rank. It is undesirable that the Secretary of State for India should be left in any doubt as to the quarter from which military advice should be offered him. The principle upon which we think it important to insist is that the sole responsible military adviser of the Secretary of State should be the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. This advice could be tendered either through his Deputy Chief established in the India Office, or directly by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff himself, who should be authorised to attend any meeting of the Council of India at which military questions of first importance are to be discussed.5. We recommend in Section III. that the commander-in-Chief in India shall be appointed with the concurrence of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and that the Commander-in-Chief shall be the sole military adviser of the Government of India. Jf this system can be established, the chain of military responsibility for questions
of an Imperial character will be complete. On the one hand, the Oommander-in-Chief will look to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for supreme direction in all questions of Imperial military policy in which India is concerned ; and, on the other hand, the Governor-General will look to the Commander-in-Chief for military advice upon questions in which India only is concerned, and also upon questions of a wider military character with confidence that the&apos; Commander-in-Chief will be in a position to express upon the latter the considered views of the Chief of the Imperial General -Staff.G. We believe that, under the plan thus proposed, the Government of India will retain its statutory control over the Army in India, that the Governor-General will he assured of undivided counsel upon military questions, and that uniformity of military policy will at last be established between Great Britain and India.Section II. Defence Committee.7. Our attention has been called to the Committee of Defence set up in India by the Governor-General during the war. It composition and functions follow those of the Committee of Imperial Defence in this country as they were understood to be after it was reconstituted on a new basis in 1902 and before the establishment of its permanent secretariat in 1905.That Committee was consultative and not executive. It had no administrative functions. It could not prescribe a policy or give directions. Its duty was to advise. It interfered with no existing authority. It possessed no fixed constitution, and the persons composing it were selected by the Prime Minister from among his colleagues and their technical assistants, with the addition of any person whose advice he might desire to obtain upon the matters about to be discussed. The Committee, in short, contained no ex offi.cio member except the Prime Minister himself, and this flexibility, as Mr. Balfour pointed out at the time, gave it an advantage of first-rate importance in dealing with the manifold subjects that gather round the problem of national defence.8. Such, we understand, was the body upon which the Governor-Genera] modelled the Defence Committee in India, and we are firmly convinced that, taken in conjunction with the existence of the War Book, which had been prepared in 191-1, it contributed valuable assistance towards bringing India into line with Great Britain during the war, and. that it should not he allowed to disappear.We recommend that its Secretary should, be a member of the Governor-General&apos;s Private Secretariat, and that he should have charge of the records and be responsible for the preparation and upkeep of the War Book.9. The War Book, designed by Sir Maurice Hankey some years before 1914, was planned with a view to the instant mobilisation of all government departments at home on the outbreak of war. For the first time in this country the attention of all Departments of Government was drawn to the fact that war was not the sole business of.the Admiralty and the War Office, but that it was the concern of practically every Department of State. The Defence Committee, by its composition and its method of working, first suggested this somewhat novel conception of modern war, but the War Book stereotyped it and fixed it indelibly in the minds of the whole Civil Service.The War Book prepared in India in 1914 has been laid before us. It is a work of such value that we strongly recommend that it should be constantly revised and kept up to-date by the officer we have designated, who will at the same time he the Secretary of the Defence Committee.We would suggest that the Secretary of the Indian Defence Committee should be placed in direct touch with the Secretary of the Imperial Defence Committee in London, so that as far as possible the measures concerted by the latter should be applied by the Governor-General in India, so far as they are appropriate to local, conditions.Section III.The High Command.10. The definition of the High Command in India in future.requires a few pre-limmary words of explanation. We have before observed that our attention has been drawn to the importance of keeping in view in any proposals we may make, the
gradual approach of the Government of I ndia to a Domin ion status. We have also kept before our minds the possibility that in the near future Imperial control over the military policy of the Empire may take a form other than that which obtains at the present time, leading to the establishment of a real Imperial General Staff deriving its authority, not from the War Office and the British Parliament, but from an Imperial Council such as that contemplated in 1907, which materialised in the course of the late war, in what has been called an Imperial Cabinet.We have, however, felt ourselves obliged to base the. recommendations we are about to make upon existing facts. We are unable to admit any close resemblance between the principles which are applied to army administration in this country, governed as it is under democratic parliamentary institutions, and the conditions that obtain in India, Avhere the government remains of a bureaucratic character with such parliamentary checks as are found to be possible. No analogy exists between the Government of India and that of any European country. It appears to us, therefore, that army administration in India must conform to the principles laid down by the statutes upon which that Government is based, which place the control of the Army in India in the hands of the Governor-General in Council.1.1. We have endeavoured to superimpose upon the existing fabric of Indian army administration the general staff idea. In other words, while leaving the control of the Army in India to the Governor-General in Council, we have tried to knit closer the relations betAveen the high command in India and the high command as it now exists at the centre of the Empire. We have considered and rejected the proposal to establish in India a civilian Member of the Executive Council responsible for the Army, and an Army Council with collective responsibilities, as unsuited to Indian requirements at the present time. Among the numerous recommendations that have been made in former years for the reconstitution of the War Department, avc have adopted that of Lord Lytton, that the Commander-in-Chief should be himself the only military member of the Viceroy&apos;s Council, and we have not thought it conducive to good administration, that upon the Execute Council the commander-in-Chief should have any military colleague or competitor entitled to deal with the administration of army affairs.12. We recommend that in future the Army Department and the Headquarters Staff should be consolidated under one head, and with a single secretariat, which is not at present the case, and that the Commander-in-Chief should be in that capacity con-sidered. to be the administrative, as avell as the executive head of the Army, subject only to the Governor-General in Council, in whom the supreme control of the Army is vested by statute. Every trace of the duality of functions resulting from the same officer being Commander-in-Chief and Member-in-Charge of the Army Depart-meiit should, be SAvept aAvay.13. We are of opinion that the financial responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief should not be divorced from his executive responsibilities, and that, avhile his purely military status should be in no way affected, it should be recognised that he possesses a personal and professional interest in and responsibility for the economical admini-stration of Army funds. We are in agreement with the view that the Commander-in-Chief should be looked upon by all His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects and feudatories in India as the depository and representative of a personal authority, second only to that of the Viceroy; and we are strongly of opinion that any change in the position of the Commander-in-Chief, which Avould have the effect of Aveakening that authority, is inadvisable.14. We propose that a Military Council should he established, composed of high staff officers and others, to assist the Commander-in-Chief in the performance of his administrative functions. This body would have no collective responsibility. Its members, however, would be individually responsible for the branches they would be called upon to administer.15. We hold the position of the Secretary to Government in the Army Department, as it is generally understood, to be inconvenient and undesirable, as rendering possible an interference avith the sole right of the Commander-in-Chief to offer military advice to the Governor-General in Council.16. We purpose to deal in Part II. of our Report with the personnel of the Military Council and their respective functions, responsibilities and powers.
17. We are in agreement with the General Stall&apos; view that the Oomniander-in-chief in India should be more directly in touch with the Chief of the Imperial General Stall&quot;, with a view to obtaining increased efficiency as regards the organisation, equipment and training of the Army in India, so as to develop the military resources of India in a manner suited to Imperial, necessities. We have already stated that, in our view, the Commander-in-Chief in India should have the established right to communicate in peace with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in London with regard to strategical plans, war organisation, training and the selection for commands and senior staff appointments. But we are not prepared to dogmatise as to whether the Government of India or the Imperial Government at Whitehall is to be responsible for the military safety of India. It is obvious that, if the gradual approach of India to a Dominion status is to be taken as an axiom, this question can be resolved only by the exercise of judgment, tact, and the principle of &quot;give and take.&quot; We, however, are strongly of opinion that, while unity of administration is for the present out of the question, unity of conception on. broad lines of military policy, such as those for which an Imperial General Staff should be responsible, is essential in the interests of India herself and of the Empire as a whole. For this reason we suggest that the Commander-in-Chief in India should he appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the recommendation of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and that the same procedure should be observed in the appointment of the Chief of the General Staff in India. Should this recommendation be approved, given a close co-operation and. correspondence between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief in India, we believe that as much will have been done towards securing unity of military purpose as can be profitably accomplished at the present time.18. We have said that, in our opinion, the Commander-in-Chief should be the sole military adviser of the Government of India. So important a function carries with it a necessity that the Commander-in-Chief shall be in the closest relation to the Governor-General in Council during the progress of hostilities and at all moments in peace when military questions of the first importance come under discussion. At the same time we cannot disregard the importance of personal inspection from time to time of the larger army formations by the Commander-in-Chief himself. During his absence from headquarters under peace conditions, we therefore recommend that he should delegate to his Chief of the General Staff such functions as he thinks may he properly exercised by that officer during his absence. We do not contemplate that under any circumstances the Commander-in-Chief should himself take the field in war. In our view the command of military operations, whether on a large or small scale, should always be entrusted to an officer specially selected for that purpose. We are too well aware of the inconvenience and clanger created in 1914 by stripping the War Office of its most experienced advisers and administrators, to desire to see a repetition in India of so unfortunate an incident. To the personal influence of the-recognised head of the Army of India, especially over Indian troops, we have already alluded, and while we are anxious that it should not be supposed that we depreciate the value of his making himself thoroughly acquainted with the sentiments and requirements of officers and troops in all parts of India, we desire to make clear that, during moments of tension, it would not be consistent with the efficient discharge of his highest duties to absent himself from the council table of the Governor-General.19. We are convinced that the Commander-in-Chief, as being an &quot; Extra-ordinary ; * Member of Council, could be relieved of considerable technical responsibility. There appears to us no sound and valid reason why his signature should be obtained to despatches from the Government of India upon questions which have no military significance or importance, or that he should be required to study and record his opinion on cases which relate exclusively to the civil administration. We are sure that a liberal interpretation of the necessities of Indian administration would lead to an appreciable reduction of his duties. We, therefore, recommend that he should be excused attendance at the Executive and Legislative Councils except when the. business under discussion affects military interests.20. We have refrained from exploring in detail the functions which, in our view, should in future be imposed upon the Military Council which we have recommended. We believe that this can best be done after the visit of the committee to India.
C. M. WAGSTAFF, Brig.-Genh, Secretary. 3rd November 1919.21. The recommendations we have made in Part I. of our Report are based upon general principles to which the whole committee have given their adherence, upon a mass of documentary evidence that has been at their disposal, and upon the con-ferences between the members of the committee and officers and others with profound experience of the working of army administration in India, previous to the war, during the war and since the armistice. 1We offer these recommendations to the Secretary of State for India in the hope that he will obtain for them the early sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in order that the labours of this committee may not, like those of so many others, be thrown away.ESHER.M.

Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of Slate for : .India, dated 1st April 1920.Your telegram dated 10th December 1919, Army Committee.. We have carefully examined and discussed in Council proposals put forward in Part I. of the Committee&apos;s report.2. My criticisms and comments on these proposals are set forth in the printed statement of my evidence before the Committee, copies of which have already been sent you.3. With these criticisms and comments my colleagues are, generally speaking, in full agreement, and, subject to the remarks below, they are prepared to accept them.4. Points to which prominence has been given in course of our examina-tion of Part I. are as follows : (A) There is no objection to Commander-in-Chief corresponding-direct with Chief of the Imperial General Staff on all questions of organisa-tion, training, equipment and personnel but on questions of military policy, more especially those which affect the distribution and recruitment of Indian troops or their employment outside India, we consider that all communica-tions should be made through the normal channel, viz., through the Govern-ment of India and the Secretary of State.(B) Although desirability of establishing closer relations between Chief of the Imperial General staff and Commander-in-Chief is fully recognised, independence of Government of India from control of Imperial General Staff as distinct from Bis Majesty&apos;s Government should be beyond all doubt, and it should be made clear that in matters of military policy the Government of India is in no way subordinate to War Office.(C) Secretary in Military Department, India Office, should be an officer of Indian Army who has commanded an Indian unit, and thus acquired first-hand knowledge of idiosyncracies of Indian troops; we agree that Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be sole responsible military adviser of Secretary of State, and that there is consequently no need to have officer of high rank on India Council. Position of Cobbe in Military Department, India Office, seems, however, a difficult one, as he will have to serve two masters, and fact of his being a Deputy to Chief of the Imperial General Staff might tend to give General Staff undue influence in Indian matters and thereby weaken our authority. Latter might be safeguarded by prescribing that no decisions on questions of policy should be arrived at without previously ascertaining our views.(D) We agree that Commander-in-Chief should be sole military adviser of Government of India. There is no objection to Chief of the Imperial General Staff being consulted in regard to his appointment or that of Chief of the General Staff in India, but selection and nomination should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in consultation with the Government of India. *(E) While agreeing that it is desirable that position of Defence Com-mittee should be better defined, we hold that it should have no executive authority, and that any advice of importance it may tender should require confirmation (groups omitted) Council. There would be no objection to officer of General Staff attending meeting of Defence Committee to make notes. But it is preferable that officially Committees should be purely civil organisation, and that the duties of secretaries should be performed, as heretofore, by Viceroy&apos;s Private Secretary. Work on war book could be entrusted, as at present, to general staff. Having regard to the different status proposed for Secretary, we do not think that latter should correspond direct with Secretary of Imperial Defence Committee in London.jo  1327     100 4/20
(F) We agree (Commander-in-Ghief ?) should have no military colleague -on. the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council. Duties and responsibilities of his office are, however, more than any one individual can be expected to discharge, and it is essential that he should be relieved of a considerable portion of his administrative work. We, therefore, recommend that responsibility for manufacture and provision of stores ,and supplies required by the Army, administration of factories and of Royal Indian Marine should be transferred to a civilian member of Council to be called Civil Army Member. Latter would be responsible for supply of Army requirements, but would be entirely independent of Commander-in-Chief and have his own secretarial establishment.(G) We concur in formation of the proposed Military Council, and agree that one of its principal functions should be to watch progress of the military expenditure.(H) We agree that Secretary of consolidated Army Department and Army Headquarters should be a civilian.(I) We demur to the statement made in para. 17 of report that object of increasing efficiency of Army in India is to develop resources of India in a manner suited to Imperial necessities. We prefer (? formula) suggested in para. 10 of the statement of my evidence before Committee.(J) We agree that Commander-in-Chief should be excused attendance at Executive and Legislative Councils except when business under dis-cussion embraces military interest.5. Finance Member does not share opinions recorded under para. 4 (F). He is opposed to the appointment of Civil Army Member, and considers undoubtedly economical use of financial resources of the Army will not be secured under dual control resulting from dividing up of Army business between Commander-in-Chief and proposed civil member. He considers sooner or later friction would result, and that (proposal ?) would provide no one who could spare the time to (corrupt group) expenditure and think out economies. He would, therefore, prefer to have an Army Member-responsible for military policy and a Commander-in-Chief subordinate to him, who would be responsible for command, training and discipline.6.
