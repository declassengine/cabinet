D 10/91.Int emat ional Labour &quot;Office, 7, Seamore Place, Curzon Street, London, Wclo15th April 1920.Sir,I have the honour to refer to my circular letter of the 3rdFebruary last cn the subject of the Special Session of theInternational Labour Conference which is to take place at Genoa on june 15th next to deal with questions relating to seamen, an:&apos; tosay that the Governing Body, at their meeting in Lone? on j on theS2n&amp; ultimo, gave further consideration to the method of appointingdelegates and advisers to the Genoa Conference,,     After a consider-able discussion a resolution, which I was instructed to convey totho various Governments, was adopted in the following terms&quot;In order to avoid possible confusion in the appointing of &quot;non-Government delegates to the forthcoming Maritime Conference &quot;at Genoa, and any future special conferences, the Governing &quot;Body deems it advisable to declare that the 3rd paragraph, &quot;Article III, 389, of the Treaty of Peace should be interpreted &quot;to mean thatWIto&apos;all general conference of representatives of the &quot;Members,, special or otherwise, nongovernment delegates should &quot;bo chosen in agreement with employers- associations and &quot;workers&apos;4&apos;&apos; federations,, moot representative of all sections of &quot;industry, if such organisations ei:ist(;n&apos;In passing this resolution tho Governing Body of courserealised that it rested with the Governments to select theirdeleg tea in whatever manner seemed best to them, so long as it wasin conformity with the provisions of Article 389 of &apos;i-he Treaty ofVersailles,,   At the same time they felt that it was desirable todraw attention to the speoi- 1 difficulty which arises in the c;.-seof the Genoa Conference,   Although that Conference will constitute a regular session of the International Labour Conference inaccordance vith the Artiole just referred to, it will only be concerned/Sir Malcolm Delevingne; K*CtB Home Office,Lone&quot; on 9.
153joncerned with ono speoial kind of labour, namely that of seamen, 1 nd at first sight it might appear that only persons who were ompetent to deal with maritime questions would be eligible for lomination as delegates and advisers.      It has to be borne in mind, KTOeyer, that as the Genoa Conference will    constitute one of the leries of oonferences of which the Washington Meeting was the first, ,t is desirable to maintain some continuity if possible.    It will In the first place greatly facilitate the proceedings, if a certain lumber of the delegates are already familiar with the rules of procedure and the methods adopted at Washington for conducting business,    further, the Central Organisations of Employers and iJrade Unions in several countries have pointed out that they are concerned not with any particular industries, but.with all industries iand that if they are left out of account altogether in the selection of delegates and advisers for the Genoa Conference, a difficult precedent might be created which might lead to a de^^a.being made by any industries particularly interested in the subjects for discussion at future Conferences that the choice of delegates should rest exclusively with them and not with the Central Organisations9 .   It will readily be appreciated that any continuity of policy and the adoption of uniform principles of International ^tour legislation would be rendered exceedingly difficult, if such^ claims were admitted.At the same time, the Governing Body fully appreciated the importance of representation be in a -dven to the ship owners1 and $earners organisations if the decisions of the Genoa Conference are to possess the necessary authorityaIf tfour Government has already made its choice of delegates and advisers, it would clearly,bo too late for them to reconsider the method of nomination0    If, on the other hand, the choice has not yet/been made, it may be thought advisable to take the above considerations into account.   I would venture to suggest that a possible solution would be to select as one of the government delegates/
legates a Person who represented your Government at the Washington ?ference, and that ? the employers&apos; and workers&apos; legetes the Central Organisation of employers and workers in your county should at any rate be consulted before the nomination is ?de, even though it may ultimately be found desirable to appoint a ? owner and a representative of the seamen as the titular delegates ? the Genoa Conference.

I should be gr?atly obliged in the names of the delegates and ?visers appointed could be communic?ted to me as early as possible, ? order that an estimate may be made of the probable numbers who ? attend the meeting, and the necessary measures fo? its ?commodation may be taken accordingly,

I have the honour to be,

Sir,

Your obedient Servant,
