Um v * *106(P 3102)Z&apos;Vom Fwero//, 20t/i 4priJ 1920. (Received 22nd, 10 a.m.)468 S.   Following telegram from Dobbs, 5 S., dated 19th April: -&quot; Both delegations agreed to-clay first subject of discussion should be views of British Government regarding national status of Afghanistan, as this is felt by-Afghans to be fundamental, and without preliminary assurances on this point other misunderstandings cannot be successfully dealt with. Afghans stated their first doubt to be whether wo consider Grant&apos;s letter regarding freedom of foreign relations to be equally binding with actual peace treaty. I replied in the affirmative. Second point was Afghan representation at Court of St. James&apos;. I replied that this was question on which I was empowered to give no assurance, as British Government could not even discuss it until they were satisfied of Afghanistan&apos;s sincere desire for our friendship and until subsequent stage of consideration of friendship treaty was reached.   They said they wanted representative for three reasons : &quot; (a) It is wounding to Afghan amour propre not to be treated like other independent States.&quot; (6) They wish to have official in England to look after young Afghans whom they desire to send to England for education, and to purchase English stores direct instead of through intermediary of Indian merchants and agents. They think that when there is a difference of opinion between themselves and Government of India they should be allowed to represent their case to British Government direct instead of its having to go through the Indian Government. I said that I would inform my Government of their statements, but I could tell them at once that our refusal to allow representations in London was not due to design to lower status of Afghanistan, but to fact that practically every question arising between Great Britain and Afghanistan concerns Indian interests alone, and Government of India with their special know-ledge of Indian interests must obviously have principal, say in the matter. Therefore Afghan representative in London would be fifth wheel in coach, and settlement of the question between the two Governments would only be delayed and confused. As matter of curiosity I enquired whether, supposing that Afghan representatives were at auy future time admitted to England, Afghanistan would wish to receive British Minister. They replied yes, as all their former ideas of isolation had been altered and they would give him full liberty of official and social intercourse, though peculiar Afghan circumstances might make it necessary to go slow in some respects.&quot;Third point was whether Afghanistan is at liberty to send representatives to other States. I replied yes, if other States will consent to receive them. Afghans will put forward further points under this main head to-morrow.&quot; At the beginning of the discussion Mali mud Tarsi made strong appeals for venue of conference to be changed to some place much nearer the frontier. I replied courteously that this was impossible to arrange.&quot;5*
