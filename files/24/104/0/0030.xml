The railwaymen, cotton operatives and transport workers, including 1 busmen, aro the most restless.   The railwaymen frankly admit that their demands are due to the advances in the wages of other industries and they threaten a &quot;stay-in&quot; strike as from May 1st. On the other hand, there is certainly an increase in production throughout the country.   To quote one example, the Birmingham Small Arms Company, who employ a very large number of men, give &amp; bonus to their operatives on production.   Up till five weeks ago, the men were earning only 30$ of the bonuB, but tho output has increased during the last five weeks until now they are earning 80$.   This is an undoubted sign that they are growing tired of unrest.The Demonstration of Ex-Service men in Hydo Park was large but the speeches were comparatively moderate, though there was talk on one platform of a surprise march on Downing Street.The blinded men, who have met with much public sympathy during their maroh to London, will arrive at the end of this weeip.The May Day celebration in London will probably be large but there is little real enthusiasm for it in the Provinces.The high cost of paper and printing is a blessing in disgui^. fhe revolutionary newspapers are finding it very hard to pay their way.The/
The Herald League is losing support and ic in need of funds.A side light on Mr. Lansbury&apos;8 tour in Russia is given in a letter from a Russian in Moscow, who says that the streets were specially lighted during&apos; &quot;Lord Lcnsburv1 s&quot; visit and relapsed into darkness when he left.
THIS COAL MINERSThe recent bollot has resulted in temporary quiet in;  &apos; most of the coalfields.   In South Wales, however, there are several cross-currents and a break between the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation is not impossible.   These miners, on the whole, think that they are penalised by national awards and would favour a return to district rates.   Such a programme will be bitterly opposed by the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain. -:mg RAILWAYMANThe1 restlessness among railwaymen is increasing.   From a statement by llr. Cramp it is clear that their demands are not made&quot;&apos;&quot;on account of the pinch of high prices but because other industries are having an advance of wages.   There can be no railway strike for some weeks but in the meantime they are determined to &quot;work to rule.book&quot; if their demands are not granted by April 30th.   Mr. W, T. A. Foot, of the London District Council, is trying to engineer a &quot;stay in&quot; strike.The Railway Clerks Association is organising itself -   politically although many members are reported to be seceding to the National Union of Railwayman.   A London and District Political Advisory Council has been formed, of which S. C. Button of Watford is secretary.   The aim of this Council is to organise members in conjunction with the Labour Parties of the districts in which they reside so that a watch may be kept on all Parliamentary and local Government developments and suitable opportunities for action in the interests of the Railway Clerks Association and the Labour movement utilised.     Groups are being formed in all parts of London.MAY/
MAY day the publicity given by the Labour Press to tho preparatioi for May Day seem to show that tho leaders are not sure of suppi from the rani: and file.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is using the occasion, under the name of &quot;Rooster Day&quot;, to augment its fundif and will sell flags, badges and literature -in Hyde Park.   The London Co-operative Societies are taking a prominent part in the arrangements.   The tickets for the Albert Hall Meeting ha^l not yet been all sold, but the demonstration in Hyde Park is sure to be large: considerable support will come from the National Union of Railwaymen.   Mr. Mark Starr will speak in Esperanto from one of the platforms.   The Co-operative Wholesale Society thinks that it will lose  14,000 by the Demonstration. jAt Demonstrations in South Wales the miners will be asked! to put forward a demand that the Government shall take control I of the selling prices of home production, that the limitation of coal prices shall be removed and the miners paid a wage commensurate with the danger and difficulty of their employment The Labour Party will also be asked to urge that housing shall I be a charge on national funds.In Bradford a complete stoppage of work is expected and I the trams will not be running.   At Sheffield the principal speakers will be J. Bromley, Arthur Ponsonby, William Paul and Mrs. Helen Crawford.At Newcastle a demonstration, with sports for children, has been arranged; meetings will also be held at Jarrow and Wallsend, but my correspondent says there is very little enthusiasm.   Appeals to the local employers to pay the men foil the holiday have been refused and had May Day not fallen on a I Saturday   the proceedings wo*uld have been a fiasco. I
- 3 -103Yorkshire Textile employers have refused to pay their workers for May Day end the Yorkshire Miners are also concerned about their wages, which they want paid on Friday.The South Derbyshire Miners1 Association has decided that May Day shall be celebrated as a general holiday through out the coalfield.The &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee has circularised all Trade Unions, Trades Councils and local Labour Parties with an appeal to demand peace with Soviet Russia.iHE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES :The officials of the Co-operative Societies are doing their best to foment resistance to the claim for Income Tax. Many meetings have been held but it is doubtful whether the rank and file are.seriously interested in the matter.   On April 17th at Dewsbury Mr, Tom Myers, U.P., said that the Yorkshire Co-operators cared nothing for the principle of co-operation and only used the Stores in order to receive a dividend, and there was therefore no effective machinery with which the taxation could be opposed.   In Coventry and Leicester, on the other hand, the body of Co-operators is reported to be strongly opposed to taxation.The Co-operative V/wholesale Society has purchased 4,000 acres of mining land in Yorkshire; the directors intend to sink two shafts and expect an annual output of one million tons.   The spinning and weaving mills of Messrs. Hamlyn Brothers have also been acquired for the sum of  270,000; the present output is abaut 10,000 yards of serge per week.The movement for inducing Trade Union branches to transfer their funds to Co-operative Societies continues with some success.   The Stratford and Edmonton Societies, with a membership of 50,000 and 25,000 respectively, havedecided/
Ikdecided to amalgamate from September next under the title of the &quot;London Co-operative Society&quot;.   Efforts are also to be made to bring the. London Perseverance Society in Marylebonc arit the Hendon Society of. Finchley and the Hampstead Garden Suburb into the amalgamation.   This would reduce the number of co-operative societies in the Metropolis to five&apos;, the others being Woolwich with its 70,000 members, West London with 14,000 members, the South Suburban (a recent amalgamation of the Croydon, Penge and Bromley societies) with 25,000, and the Little Anchor Society, which operates in Whitechapel and the foreign quarter of East London.   This quintette of London societies has a combined membership of 184,000.THE MARCH OF BLINDED MENThe contingents of blinded men who are marching to London number about 250.&apos;,They walk, together by day but go to differon towns to sleep owing to the lack&apos;of sleeping accommodation. They are timed to reach Watford and Sudbury on Ar)ril 22nd. There they will be joined by contingents from the Home Countiee to the number of perhaps 500.   They will then proceed to London via Willesdon on   April 24th.   J. Grierson and G. Chamborlain, the President and Organising-Secretary of the Demonstration Committee, may be identical with the two extremist members of the National Union of Railwaymen of the : same names.The men have received very great sympathy from ,the general public and have collected a considerable sum of money in the towns through which they passed.   The men themselves say that their, demands; are technical education, national and municipal workshops, where the blind can earn a living wage, and pensions for the aged and infirm.   The Demonstration includes a number of civilians who did not serve in, the War., &apos; VISIT/
VISIT &quot;OP PRIHCE ALBERT TO THE TYUESIDBMy Newcastle correspondent reports that the visit ofPrinoe Albert to his area was a great success and writes:-&quot;There is no evidence of extreme ideas making headway here.   This may he confirmed by the enthusiastic reception given td Prince Albert during his two days visit-to Tyneside on-the 16th and 17th instant.   Everywhoro he went and especially in the yards, His Royal Highness was very well received by the workmen.THE THIRD INTERMTIONALThe &quot;Daily Herald&quot; of April 21st prints a remarkable document which appeared in the Viennese &quot;Rote Fahne&quot;.   It is signed by &quot;The Executive Committee of the Third International&quot;. The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; professes to doubt the authenticity of the document:1* It is a mistake to demand that where wage.  slavery still exists, the revolutionary advance guard must be backed at the beginning by the :.;    &apos; majority of the people.2. It is a mistake to think that the exploiters&apos;resistance can be broken without the use of force and terror.3. It is a mistake to spend one&apos;s time deploringcivil war against, the exploiter, which is the unavoidable outcome of the policy of the Government.4. It is a mistake not to acknowledge openly thatthe dictatorship of the Proletariat implies the smashing of the capitalist Stats machine.&apos; : 5.    /       Even the most short-sighted must see that crisis and ruin are unavoidable and that we can overcome them by revolutionary means only, but to use this fact as a. bogy is anti-revolutionary cowardice.6. To support bourgeois clamour about liberty of meeting and of the Press, and not to explain clearly the previous necessity of expropriation s In printing and paper works, is a dangerous prejudice.-7. You are not carrying on propaganda .in favour.  of. immediate revolutionary measures to obtain possession of large property.8. (Censored).9. You are doing nothing to prepare for&quot;thepassing over of the troops to our side.The/
H     Q     MThe tenth point condemns any attempt to form a Fourth International.   The statement then says:-&quot;The Executive Committee of the Third International invites all who honestly fight for the Dictatorship of the Proletariat to join them,&quot;The Executive Committee is prepared to negotiate with all parties willing to creak with the Second International.   It invites the representatives of such parties to come to Russia. It will refuse, however, to co-operate with the Right Wing leaders of the Independents and of the Longnetists.&quot;The Committee weloomes the decision of the Leipzig Conference to break with the Second International, and invites a delegation from the Independents.   It is convince that the growth of the revolutionary mass movement will fo the party to affiliate to the Communist International.&quot;THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUN1ST INTERNATIONAL.&quot;THE COST OF LIVINGDisoontent at the rise.in prices has produced a resolution of the Scarborough Branch of the National Union of Railwaymen, which asks the Executive of the Triple Alliance &quot;to fix a date by which the Government must secure what the Alliance considers a reasonable reduction in the cost of living, on which date the whole Triple Alliance shall cease work until such time as the cost of living goes down&quot;.THE HOUSING question in working olass districts there is consternation at the proposal to increase the pre-war rentals.   In the East End, where the Workers1 Socialist Federation has some influence, there is talk of a &quot;no-rent strike&quot;.COVENTRYMy correspondent sends a reassuring report from this area, which has passed through cycles of extreme revolutionary feelingHe/
He writes:-&quot;After attending many of these extreme Socialist meetings in Coventry and carefully observing the audiences end having heard the views of many workers whom I have associated with, I have formed the opinion that the workers of Coventry, although strong Trade Unionists, are not revolutionary at present.   There are many sympathisers with the speakers at these meetings, but also a fair amount of opposition.   The great majority are apathetic and obviously unconvinced.&quot;ABEL INS AMONG EX-SERVICE MENA very large crowd of ex-Service men, variously estimated at from 10,000 to 50,000, came to the Demonstration in Hyde Park on April 18th.   The men were orderly and the speeches moderate, except for the comments on the Government treatment of ex-soldiers.   To the usual resolution about unemployment, gratuities pensions and discharges was coupled a demand for a public enquiry into the action of the Police on March 1st.The only untoward incident was an appeal by two men, whose names could not be obtained, for volunteers to meet in Whitehall and Downing Street in order to force the Government to keep an Army of soldiers and police to prevent their approach, and try conclusions with them.   Their remarks appeared to meet with&quot; favour and a large number of hands went up.There is some reason for believing that there will be serious efforts made in the Spring and Summer months to undermine the loyalty of serving soldiers.   Bodies like the British Socialist Party, the Herald League, the Workers&apos; Socialist Federation and some sections of the Independent Labour Party are appealing to their members to destroy patriotic feeling.The Paddington branch of the National Union of Ex-Service Ken has agreed that the service of members should be placed at the disposal of Labour for the purpose of forming a local Soldiers Council or section of the &quot;Red Army.&quot;The/
- 8 -The Cowcaddens branch of the International Union of Ex-Service Men is meeting with a good deal of opposition; - at a recent meeting one of the three speakers was, intoxicated; my correspondent saw these three men divide the collection and put the money in their pockets.According to the current issue of &quot;Solidarity&quot;, the East London branch of the International Union has taken the lead in forming local Social Soviets. THE HERALD; LEAGUEThe Herald League seems to have fallen on evil days. On April 18th a speaker at the Lee Green Branch complained that the forty members enrolled two months ago numbered only eight and the Committee had fallen from five to two.   The .   remainder&apos;had Joined the Labour Party because the League was too extreme in its views.   It is also seriously hampered for funds.   At Birmingham attendances have also been poor. Mr. W. Gee, of the Socialist Labour P^rty, speaking on April 18th, said that Birmingham was the worst place he had ever been in and all he could say was that workers in Birmingham deserved all they got.   The Government could do just what it liked: with them.   &quot;Why don11 you wake up and; do something for yourselves&quot;, he cried.   &quot;Why don&apos;t you study the Socialist methods?&quot; INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OP TEE WORLDW. Pielder, of tho Industrial Workers of tho World, is reported to have shown letters from Chicago at the INTERNATIONAL) Socialist Club, urging that the dock labourers in England should stop work until the United States released all Industrial Workers of the World prisoners.   The Chicago ofiij meanwhile,, would support them with funds.MR./I
-9- &apos;    112MR. LANSBURYA remarkable letter from a Russian in Moscow has been published in the &quot;Morning Post&quot;, showing that Moscow was specially lighted up during the whole time of Mr. Lanebury&apos;s visit and relapsed into darkness as soon as he had left. He believed Mr. Lanabury to be an English Peer whom the Soviet Government waB very anxious to conciliate.My correspondent at Liverpool reports that Mr. Lansbury received an enthusiastic welcome from an audience of 3,000 people but before he had finished his lecture one half had left the Hall and there was scarcely any applause.   This was duo to his advocacy of industrial conscription which seems for the time to have been the most effective propaganda against Bolshevism.EXTREMIST NEWSPAPERSThe high price of paper and printing is seriously hampering the revolutionary movement in England and is causing some bickering among the extremists themselves.   For example, when Miss Pankhurst was asked to give a gratuitous advertisement to the &quot;Spur&quot;, she charged tho ordinary advertisement rates of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;.   This is being stigmatised as &quot;Communism -at so much an inch&quot;.aTHE WOUNDING Off SIDNEY HANSONHanson, a man who gets his living by making revolutionary speeches in the Park, was stabbed with an ice pick on the night of tho 11th April by Frank Robert Lark, aged 66, who said that he had done it&apos; because Hanson was inciting young men to revolution.   Lark has been identified a3 a man who was bound over in 1913 for a similar stabbing assault on another person. Lark was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court to-day.SINN/
SIM IfSIN Ig GREAT BRITAINThe first Annual Conference of the Irish Labour Party    i of Great Britain was held at Gateahead on April 11th.   It was decided that the Irish Labour Party should not affiliate itself to any other organisation,   There was a complaint on the part of Councillor Ryan that the Irish Self-Determination League is working against the Party.A Demonstration convened by the Glasgow Trade and Labour Council on April 18th was attended by 4,000 people to protest against &quot;the oppressive Military rule in Ireland&quot;,   Arthur McManus said in his speech that tho general strike in Ireland was called from Gateshead by two members of the Iri3h Executive,   It is significant that LieutBnant-Colonel Maione, M.P., said that tho Irish could give points to the Scotch workers in so far that they had a large and organised force and were drilled and equipped to fight for life against british! rule.   He appealed to the workers to strike in sympathy with Ireland when called upon.   William Gallacher also asked the workers to pledge themselves to strike and said that a strike had been arranged on the Clyde for April 14th if the Mount Joy prisoners had not been released.A meeting of the &quot;Clan-na-Gael&quot; is to be held in Liverpool at the end of this week; 3ix delegates are expected to attend from Glasgow,On April 11th a meeting was convened by the Mersey Workers&apos; Committee in Liverpool to protest against the arrsst of three Irishmen.   A feature of the meeting was an attack*on the Labour Party by Mr. P. J. Kelly, who said that the British workers had no one but themselves to blame for the manufacture and transport of guns and ammunition which were sent to Ireland to be used against their own countrymen.John/
- ii. 113John Kearnes, of the Liverpool Dockers, said that i  he had the opportunity he would send any ship soiling from Liverpool to Ireland with munitions to the bottom of the sea.At St. Helens five Sinn ]?ein. organisations are reported. A new Society called the &quot;Qlarnb&quot; is said to be of some importance and to be in direct touch with Dublin.   It is composed entirely of women who are taught First Aid and Signalling.   The badge is a rifle with the letters Q.I A.M.B,The arrest of Cathal 0&apos;Shannon and the search of Art 0&apos;Brian1s residence and offices have caused oonsternation in Ion don Sinn Fein, circles. .Countess Markiewicz is reported to have left for England on Tuesday evening.   Enquiries are being made.IRELANDThe general strike to obtain concessions for the prisoners in Mount joy Gaol, ordered by the National Executive of the Irish Trades Unions Congress and Labour Party, was generally observed throughout the country on the 13th and 14th with the exception of a small portion of Ulster.   The strike was called off on the 14th April on some of the prisoners being released.During the last week nearly 150 serious outrages have been committed.   Two officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary have been killed; two wounded and another fired upon.   One of the officers killed was found with his eyes bandaged and his hands tied.   At londonderry on the 14th April the Poliee escorting political prisoners were attacked and on the night of the 17th there was serious rioting and the Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks were attacked.   A large number of persons have been arrested, followed by many internments.Agrarian/
Agrarian agitation continues in County Galway where houses have &quot;been fired into and other forms of intimidation practised.The organised burnings of empty police barracks during the Easter holidays have not had the effect that was expect their main object was to raise the drooping spirits of the rank and file, but the fact that the rate payers will have to foot the bill has hud a depressing effect.   Some 56 Rebel have been arrested as being connected with outrages or as members of the Irish Republican Army and these constant arrests are having a disorganising effect on the &quot;Staff&quot; wo: of their Array.Threatening and anonymous letters are being sent to prominent local people, particularly those who are known to be anti-Sinn .S?ein.   There are indications of an attempt by the Labour side of Sinn Fein to get into,touch with the Bolsheviks of Russia for the purpose of putting the case of Ireland before them.
