ki tjlin c.p.. .11-53 VJJ jnis document is the property of,His Britannic H.:2? *UMA^lZr Majesty&apos;s Government.THE   CAB BIST,INTERALLIED ^^BTKDNSSS. memorandum by Sir Laming Wor worthington^Evans.It     I am in general agreement with the Treasury views expressed in CP. 584 for the mutual cancellation of indebtedness.S.    Lord curzon&apos;s vivid endorsement in C.P. 1093 goes further and suggests Unconditional cancellation of loans due to the United Kingdom and raises questions as to the manner and time in and at which any announcement of policy should, be made hy the Government with regard to which I should like to offer some observations.3.    Lord Curzon does not refer to the Treasury proposal to include the Dominions in the cancellation of debt.I do not think they, could be omitted, but it may be that some have raised more money locally in proportion to the advances made to them by&apos;the United Kingdom than others and it may be n&amp;oessary to remit indebtedness to each in the same proportion.4.    7/hile I agree that every appearance; of public bargaining must be avoided,.could we not use the opportunity for securing adherence by the Dominions to a scheme of Empire currency?    I have proposed in other papers and ) that a conferenceof finance Ministers of the Empire should be called together to discuss means for regulating our disjointed currency systems.        The.same conference might also
adjust the amounts of the outstanding loans and accounts between the United Kingdom and the Dominions.The two questions are not unconnected^for the power which the Dominion indebtedness gives us to draw capital and interest from the Dominions may have to be used to steady fluctuation in exchange unless some Empire currency is adopted. 5.    Lord Curzon considers that it is most desirable that if the Inter-allied debts are to be renounced, the action should be taken before the International Financial Conference under the League of Nations Bext month.It seems&apos; to me that this Conference might be used to educate publio opinion both here and in the United States and lessen the difficulties which we might otherwise meet with in Parliament.      It is true that a discussion at the Conference and a reoommendation from the Conference that the cancellation o$ Inter-allied in&amp;ebteaness is necessary for the rehabilitation-tion of Europe, would rob us of the appearance of initiative, but would it do enough to spoil the beau geste if we very shortly afterwards introduced a bill into the British Parliament for authority to accept the recommendatioaU 6.     The xe advantages of obtaining such a recommendation from the Conference appear to be:-
(a) The United states could not so easily suggestthat the renunciation by us was merely a dodge to force them to cancel their loans to us;   it might even be difficult for them to refuse if we accepted conditionally.(b) The recommendation will serve as a ballon d&apos;essai, upon which public opinion in this country can be created or tasted before the Government is committed, fc)   Any guarantee required from&apos; France or Italy  -as to imposing direct taxation or for deflating their currencies or formfunding a portion of the German indemnity need   not be imposed by us, but may form part of the reoommeudation of the conference,(d) It would enhance the prestige of the Let. n ofNations and demonstrate the value the Government itsattaohes to/future usefulness.(e) Time will be secured to consult the Bomirl xnsto ensure that their inclusion   and that theterms will be agreeable to them, If it be decided that recommendations should be got from the   Conference, it will be necessary to take immediate steps to secure them.-    I have little doubt that one of the neutrals, perhaps Holland,   would father the proposal and that if the British represen-tatives were well chosen, they could do what is necessary unofficially.25th April 1920
