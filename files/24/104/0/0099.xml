The most disturbing factor has been the development of Sinn Fein activities in England.Demands for higher wages are imminent.   In London tho district delegates of the Railwaymen have decided, by 75 votes to 7, to &quot;work to rule book&quot; from May 1st unless their claims are settled.The outlook in the cotton industry is brighter, but the workers seem determined to secure large advances.The Omnibus and Tramwaymen are dissatisfied and the Gas workers want a uniform rate throughout the country.On April 24th the Postal Workers in Manchester stopped work for half an hour to draw attention to their grievances.The Miners are planning another Nationalisation campaign to cost from  20,000 to  30,000.   The last is said to have cost under  5,000.The Boilermakers end Shipbuilders believe that a period of unemployment is coming and they are uneasy.May Day will probably be celebrated imposingly in London. The Soviet Government, which has urged Labour organisations in Europe to hold demonstrations, has itself decreed a day of work.LATERSINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINAT DINNER TIME TO-DAY ONLY 3,000 IRISH DOCKERS HAD STRUCK. THEY HOPED TO BRING MORE OUT TO-NIGHT.
Active preparations are being made throughout the country for May Day,- but it is believed that many of the -rank and file will work on Saturday morning.   The Scottish Ironmoulders took a ballot on the question and, out of a membership of 9,629, only 2,530 voted for a holiday.On the other hand, in the Wigan district the Garment Workers1 Union had a large majority in favour of a holiday, Probably the Miners will absent themselves from work as they are generally glad of any excuse for doing so.   In Newcastle the Tr&amp;mwaymen and Shipyard workers on the Teeside have given notice of their intention to absent themselves.   The Postal Workers of Sheffield have asked for a Bank Holiday service.   The National Union of R&amp;ilwaymen has discountenanced a general stoppage but&quot;probably sections will abstain from work.The organisers fear the competition of football;, Mr. John Hill, of the Boilermakers, implores his members to &quot;give the football match a miss&apos;&apos;.   The speakers at the Albert Hall will be Tom Mann, Robert Fleming, a Director of the Co-operatives, Sylvia Pankhurst, James Cash and Alfred Barnes, President of the Stratford Co-operatives.It seems probable that in London the Demonstration-vail be used as an advertisement for the Co-operative movement and for the sale of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.In Russia the day is not to be observed as a holiday. According to the wireless news, lenin has said that the Workers&apos; Holiday must be converted into holiday work. THE COST OP IIVIHGMy correspondents re,turn again this week to the unrest caused by high prices.   The women in Yorkshire are complaining specially about butter and sugar.   They dislikemargarine/
margarine and say that if they had more sugar they could make cheaper meals.   On April 26th a deputation of miners1 wives waited on the Executive, urging that action should he taken to reduce the cost of living.In Glasgow there is much grumbling at the increased cost of liquor under the Budget proposal.   My correspondent reports an increase of drunkenness in this area, especially on Saturdays.The Worth Eastern Railwayman at G&amp;teshead decided on April 23rd to strike one day a week to reduce the cost of living.   Other sections of,the Railwaymen are pressing the Triple Alliance to take action to the same end.   The question will be discussed when the Triple Alliance meets on May 5th. As every strike must add to the cost of necessaries these resolutions show the extraordinary ignorance on elementary economics which is to be found among the rank and file.THE HOUSIKS ft U3 ST ion the prospect of increased rents is a cause of much uneasiness.   A demonstration ha3 been arranged on Glasgow Green for May 2nd and a Scottish National Conference is to be held in Glasgow on May 22nd.FILM PROPAGANDA FOR LABOURIt is reported that the Labour Party end the Trade Unions are to use the film as propaganda.   At Leicester a Committee is said to have been formed to study the methods. At present the idea is confined to supplying the Trade Union and Labour organisations with portable projectors and films for use during elections.   So far as can be ascertained, the effective propaganda film has yet to be written.LABOUR/
LABOUR AND T.HS TAI ON C0-.0PSRATIV3 SOOjMIBgEfforts are still being made to arouse resentment against the Income Tax on the Co-operative Societies.   The main argument is that poor people not otherwise subject to Inoome Tax will be mulcted of 5 per cent,   Glasgow and Manchester are the strongholds of the movement and their leaders are gaining some support.Meanwhile the attention of the Co-operative Wholesale Society will be diverted to dealing with its own employees, who threaten a national strike,THIS SECRET BALLOT bill the great body of Trade Unionists do not appear to take much interest in the Bill,   In Glasgow.my correspondent reports that the majority are in favour of it on the ground that it is a fairer system than the present one.THa SUNDBRLA.ND BYE SLI3CTION .My local correspondent reports that Labour is by no means united in the present Election.   Mr,,&apos; John Hill, of the Boilermakers, announced that his l&amp;ecutive would support the Labour candidate, but afterwards his meeting was stigmatised as unofficial and it is probable that 1?tour men will vote according, to their individual predilections,   Tne Local Trades and Labour Council complains that the Labour candidate was not selected from the district.   The Australian Roman Catholic \   Chaplain, Father O^ozmell, has been making inflammatory speeches in the ConstituencyTBS TIN ION Off DEMOCRATIC control the attack made by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on the French
for using coloured troops in the Ruhr has proved a two-    I edged weapon.   Mr. Lansbury and Mr. Morel must have forgotten that they stand for racial equality and that whe they paint the black troops in lurid colours some of their native supporters may have a good deal to say.   At a Conference on April 24th, with Mr. Rtjnsay Mtcdoneld in the Cheir, a Persian who put this view was ruled out of order and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which has published. Mr. Morel10 articles, refused the letters of a negro, Claude McKay, whi had, in consequence, to accept the hospitality of the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; for bis attaok on Mr. Morel.   Among the resolutions passed at the Conference was a clause declaring opposition to all forms of industrial conscription.   This question and that of the negro troops bid fair to cause another split in the ranks of Labour..THB METROPOLITAN police the increase in rent allowance granted to&apos; the Metropolitan Police has given great satisfaction.   It is reported to have allayed the feeling of discontent arising from the belief that the Provincial Porces were in a more favourable position.THE DEMONSTRATION OP BLINDED MSNAt tne Demonstration in Trafalgar S^u&amp;re on April 25th the audience numbered about six thousand, who were very sympatheticIt is stated that the men were accompanied on their march by Mrs. 3own, ?/hom they call &quot;Joar* of Arc&quot;.   She is believed to be the wife of James Bown, the notorious Rotberuam agitator who was associated with Hedley (see my Report No. 39 of the 29th January).It/
It is to &quot;be regretted that a cause which deserves so much sympathy should have been exploited for political purposes. It was noticed in Trafalgar Square that the blind men were practically abandoned at the end of the Demonstration, and it was left for the Police to arrange for their dispersal and to escort them to their destinations.i. ;PEELIEG mm EX-S15HVICE MSOn April 26th a demonstration of Ex-Service men against the employment of women in offices and tramcars culminated in rioting.   In Glasgow ex-soldiers have threatened to wreck tramcars which carry recruiting posters.On April 25th delegates of the -National Federation and the Comrades of the Great War, representing 25,000 members, met at Cardiff.   They passed a resolution,&apos; condemning the Prime Minister for his attitude, towards the deputation of February   6th, demanding: training facilities for the disabled, .  . . the Immediate stoppage of discharges, a public enquiry into the events of Itarch 1st, and an additional pension of f,2 a month to all who served in the Forces. -The International Conference of Bx-Service Men will be held at Geneva on April 30th.   The only two British Societies represented will be the National and the International Unions.   Probably-A.. - E. Mander v/ill represent the former   and Patrick Burke and A. Hannah the latter.F. L. KSHBKAHN   &apos; - &apos;A violent speech was made.at the International Socialist Club on April 21st by P, L. Kehrhahn, the hunchback who . escaped from internment during the War.    He is the son of a German who fought in the Franco-Prussian War and, althoughborn/
born in England, has been registered in Germany as a German subject.MR. BERTRAND RUSSELLMr. Bertrand Russell has left for Bergen en route for Russia to write special articles for the &quot;Nation&quot;.SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINThe hunger strike at Wormwood Scrubs Prison has.given an impetus to the Sinn Feiners in London.   Great capital is made of the fact that the prisoners are untried, but the demonstrations outside Wormwood, Scrubs Prison have been .   exaggerated.   The chief organiser is Sean McGraith.   He attracts large crowds but they are not all sympathisers and on April 27 th some hostility was shown to the demonstration.On April 27th a deputation of Irish workers, chiefly from the docks, informed the Lord Mayor of Liverpool that if the Irish prisoners were not released within forty-eight hours the dockers would strike.   There are said to be more than 100,000 Irish port workers in the district.   On the other hand, I am informed from an inside source that Councillor Kelly1s threat is quite empty, for he knows he cannot get the support of the Transport Federation.There has been a talk of resorting to crimes of violence in this country if any of the hunger-strikers should die, but on the whole this seems unlikely, since the essence of such crimes is that the criminals should run no personal risk.At a.large demonstration in Liverpool on April 25th ,    Councillor Kelly urged Irishmen to abstain from loading munitionsfor Ireland, Egypt and India; the Irish, he said, would find &apos;   means of disposing of them.   At the same meeting Professor MacNeill said that from the proceeds of the Irish National LoanIrish/
Irish Ambassadors were being sent to all countries and he instanced France and Spain.Yesterday there was a disturbance in Glasgow, owing to the Police having refused to allow a meeting to take place in George Square.   The leaders were told that the proper place for the meeting was Glasgow Green; this they agreed to but. after a series of inflammatory speeches CEoeffe, the blind orator, called for them to march in military formation to George Square.   Accordingly, a body calling itself the 1B1 Company of the Irish Volunteers formed up and tried to break through the Police, who drew their batons and charged. Several arrests \v9te made.   Alarm was caused by fog signals which had been placed on tram rails by the Sinn Peiners. My correspondent reports that the feeling of the public is now running strongly against Sinn Fein.It is not unlikely that the new Society in St. Helens -&quot;Quiamb&quot; - to which I referred in my last Report, is a Branch of the Cum&amp;an-na-mBah, or Women&apos;s Auxiliary to the Irish Republican Army.My Yorkshire correspondent says that younger Englishworking men are talking of&apos; a strike &quot;to help the Irish.&quot;W\ P. Coates, of the &quot;Hands off Russia&quot; Committee, hasbeen speaking on Ireland in the Coventry district.The Leicester Railway workers&apos;have passed a resolution that the Triple Alliance shall be convened to call a national strike against the Government policy in Ireland, and asimilar resolution has been passed by the Dowlais Miners.Yesterday at Newcastle an open-air meeting was addressed by Mrs. Larlcin and others to demard the release or trial of the prisoners in Wormwood Scrubs; they marched under a Sinn Fein flag to the Mansion House and&apos;1 eft the resolution with the Lord Mayor.There are rumours among British Labour leaders of another/
another Genei-al Strike in Ireland to demand the withdrawal of the Military Forces jfrom employment in aid of the PoliceLAJDThe general situation in the country is very disturbed A considerable number of outrages have occurred.   In Dublin district the attack on Constable Dalton, an active Dublin Metropolitan Police Officer, is the only serious outrage reported during the week.   The Constable was proceeding on duty to the Railway Station about 1 p.m. on April 21st when he was shot from behind at close range; three shots were fir at him as he lay wounded on the street, without anyone makiB any effort to seize   or identify the assassins.Patrick McMahon and four others were arrested as the result of a military and police raid on the night following the murder of Constable Dalton.   McMahon is detained for deportation; the others were released after due enquiry.One point worthy of note regarding recent outrages is that the great majority ore of a nature that does not entail any danger to the perpetrators: organised attacks on defended police barracks have greatly decreased, whilst cowardly assassinations of police are on the increase.lawlessness and hostility to the Government abound everywhere, the former being manifested in land disputes, cattle driving, attacks on mails and other outrages, the latter by outbursts such as the recent Derry riots.   Some cases of burning and attempted burning of Courthouses have .. occurred and in Cork and Limerick creameries were destroyed to prevent the export of food.A reliable report from the 6th  -Division Shows that 400 rebels took part in a practice mobilization at Clogheen, Cori:East/
east Riding, on 3rd instant.   A similar exercise was carried out by the South Tipperary Brigade, Irish Republican Army, about April 10th.   This practice mobilization lasted two days.Wo polioe barracks were attacked during the weok, but very many cases.of. serious crime were reported, the greater number directly attributable to Sinn Fein, or the spirit of lawlessness which it fosters, and there are, no doubt, a large ncraber of cases which have not been reported to the police at allow   Intimidation is rampant.On Sunday 18th instant, outside Xilmihill   Roman Catholic Church, Co. Clare, Sergeant Carroll, Royal Irish Constabulary, was shot dead end Constable Collins seriously wounded by a band of armed ruffians headed by a local Volunteer named Michael Breen.   Constable Martyn, who was with the petrol, shot Breen, killing him instantly, and several of the assailants were wounded.Sinn Fein is reported to have issued orders that police going home &apos;on leave are to be attacked, and a member of the Dublin Metropolitan Police was fired at while working on his father&apos;s farm in County Cork; he has since died in hospital.   Constable Clifford, Royal Irish Constabulary,  &apos; was fired at and wounded while on leave at Waterville, Co. lerry, and two other members of the force were fired at while on leave during the week.   The motive is to make a policeman1s life more hazardous.It is said that rate-books are to be burned and that as soon as Sinn Fein have control of the Councils no rates will be levied to pay compensation awards.Sinn Fein and Labour are jubilant at the result of what they describe as the &quot;Battle of Mountjoy&quot;, and are likely to take advantage of the release of the Mountjoy prisoners to try some further scheme of outrage.   Practice mobilisationsare/
are taking plaoe which show that interest in a hostile force is unab&amp;ted. Such manoeuvres oan only encourage the rebellious and intimidate the loyalists.The industrial situation remains unaltered.   The two days general strike was very thorough outside Ulster, but the object was one for which Sinn Fein and Labour could unite, and cannot be regarded as an example of organisation by Labour.During the past week 30 officers and members of the Irish Volunteers have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in outrages.
