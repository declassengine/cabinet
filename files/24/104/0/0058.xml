There has been an outbreak of smallpox recently in East London and the neighbouring districts, and further case3 continue to be notified.   The matter ia being carefully watched, by the Ministry in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, and it is hoped that a serious epidemic may be avoided. The task of dealing with the out-break has been rendered more difficult by reason of the decline In vaccination of late years (and the consequent Inadequate protection of the population concerned), and by the refusal of some of the contacts of cases to submit to vaccination,3.      i/i edical In spec t ion ^f jUieii^ Immigrants^  In st rue t ions to Medical Inspectors appointed under the Alifins Order, 1919, have been issued by the Ministry during the month.   These instructions were based upon the recommendations of a Sub-Committee which was

6* &apos; MSilZ-^L^lliJl!^^    The malrlrriwu*rvOT&apos;the&apos;&quot; 15th &quot;March, 1920, to all local authorities (outside London) carrying out Maternity and Child Welfare Schemes, a circular letter relative to the care of Children to whom Section 9 of the War Pensions (Administrative Previsions) Act, 1918, applies -that is to gay, neglected children of sailors,   soldiers or airmen dead or still on active service with the Forces.   Local War Pensions Committees are called upon, under Regulations made by the Minister of Pensions, to inspect the homes which are offeree fcr the accommodation of such children and to visit the children periodically when they have been placed, in them, and the circular suggested that the   services of Health Visitors might, in seme instances, be of assistance to Local War Pensions Committees in this connection.    The Minister accordingly requested that local authorities carrying out Maternity and Child Welfare Schemes would favourably consider applications from Local War Pensions Committees for their consent to the employment of Health Visitors in such cases, primarily for the inspection of homes and more rarely for the supervision of the children for whem the Committees are responsible. .1, Rent ReetrictionJ^cts^    The Committee appointed toconsider these Acts informed the Minister that they had decided to recommend that the operation of the Acts should be extended for a-further substantial period, subject to amendments - the precise form and extent of which they had not then determined;   and the &quot;Minister stated in the House of Commons on the 18th March that a Bill for the purpose would be submitted ir. due course..      The Committee have now mads their report.Re-organisation of Staffs    The work ofS the Audit Staff has been largely and continuously increased in recent years owing to the constitution of new authorities subject to audit, the extension of powers and duties of existing authorities, and the extensive
development of the system,, of &quot;Government -grants &quot;If cr&quot;the &quot;purpose of which certificates are given b;y the auditors) 0    A heavy increase in audit work&apos; will result in consequence of housing grants *    To put the audit, staff in a position to cope with the present work, it was felt that a complete re-organisation of the staff and districts was necessary, and a new scheme has been approved by the Treasury and is now in operation.   Under this scheme, although there will bo no increase in tho number of Auditors, there will be a large increase in their clerical staff, to whom more work will be delegated, and further the old arrangement under which the accounts of County Councils and &apos; their Committees have been audited by separate Auditors will be abolished.     Each Auditor will have a compact and convenient district which he will be able to work from a centre where the bulk of bis work will be.     The new scheme will effect a great economy in time and in travelling and subsistence expenses, will give Auditors generally the &quot;advantage of experience of all classes of work and by its full recognition of the principle of devolution will leave the Auditors themselves free to devote *&quot; -adequate time to their more responsible duties.     It will enable the accounts of the County Councils to be audited much earlier than was possible under the old arrangements.&amp;c$p&amp; of Audit Stamp Duty.    A scale of audit stamp duties payable by local authorities and charged&apos;according to their -expenditure was fixed by the District Auditors Act, 1879, (with some modifications since introduced), but the amounts realised under this scalo have for some years fallen far short of the actual cost of the audits, and are now little more than half of that cost,    The cost of audit has risen considerably in late years owing to war bonus and other causes, and the Treasury have expressed the view, in which the Minister concurs, that the scale of stamp duties payable should now be revised so as to cover the
actual cost of audit. An amended scale has exceedingly been prepared and submitted for the consideration of the Treasury.Progress of Audit Work a    During the war the audit work, from unavoidable causes, fell greatly into arrear, and a direction was given in April, 1919, to the audit staff that the audits must be brought up to date by the 31st March, 1920.     It is gratifying to record that this result has beer/secured - though not without great efforts on the part of the audit staff - and by the end of March the audits for the periods/ended &quot;march and September, 1919, were completed.    The audit of the accounts of local authorities may therefore be considered to be -practically up to date, a position which is perhaps without precedent, in the history of district auditt
