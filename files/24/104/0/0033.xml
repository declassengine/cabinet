This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET. &apos; ftTHE CABINET.DESTRUCTION OF GERMAN WAR MATERIAL.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, the minutes of the     121 Conference held between M. Lefevre and myself on the 13th April, to consider what    Peace steps should be taken to secure the destruction of German war material in accordance Co&quot;^33 with the terms of the Peace Treaty,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office, 22nd April, 1920.Precis of a Conference held at the Ministere de la Guerre between Mr. Chtjkchill (Secretary of State for War) and M. Andre Lefevre (French Minister of War).-13th April, 1920.I There were present: Marshal Foch, General Weygand,General Btjat, &apos;General Bingham (President of the Inter-Allied Sub-Commission in Berlin). General Sackville-West, General Matjrin, andGeneral Remond (of the Direction de 1&apos;Artillerie).The Conference was opened by M. Lefevre putting certain questions to General Bingham as to the manner in which the destructions of German war material were being carried out. He made some suggestions which General Bingham said would be examined by the sub-Commission on his return to Berlin.Marshal Foch pointed out that only 500,000 rifles had been surrendered by the Germans. A certain number of rifles had been recovered by the French in the recent advance in the neutral zone. It could be assumed from this that a great many of the rifles were distributed amongst the inhabitants.General Weygand pointed out that the Germans had only handed in the list of guns to destroyed on the 8th March, the latest date upon which, according to the Peace Treaty, these guns were to be handed over for destruction being the 10th March. This was clearly a violation of the Peace Treaty, since the 12,000 guns in question could not possibly be destroyed between the 8th and 10th. Further, had the German revolution been successful all these guns would have fallen into the hands of the revolutionaries.Marshal Foch emphasized this point of view, stating that if the Treaty had been executed there would have been no arms in the Ruhr during the recent troubles in this area.The question of guns in fortresses was also raised, but was not further discussed, the question having already been dealt with by the Council of Ambassadors.Mr. Churchill said that &apos;it was important to destroy at the same time as the weapons the factories and machines that manufactured these weapons. This was agreed to, and it was reasserted that those factories that can only manufacture warlike material should be definitely closed down, and the machinery which can only be used for making weapons of war should be destroyed.   Certain machines which can be used(B20/190)   .100  4/20   H&amp;S  8161wo
for the manufacture of material used in commerce as well as war material would be dealt with separately by the Commission. It was clearly understood that machines which had a bona fide peace value would not be destroyed.The question of wood for rifle-stocks was also dealt with, but the question was finally reserved, the general opinion being that such wood could be rendered useless for warlike purposes by the planks being sawn in half.Mr. Churchill, in summing up the result of the Conference, stated : 1. The personnel of the Commission is to be increased so that both the material and the weapons can be destroyed simultaneously.2. The number of rifles surrendered by the Germans is absurd. It cannot be hoped to recover all those rifles, but every endeavour should be made to recover a number corresponding with the numbers the German Army put in the field.3. The questions of the methods of destruction raised by M. Lefevre, which are technical, should be further studied.4. It had been alleged that there were a great number of German guns hidden. Every endeavour should be made to discover the location of such guns, but the Commission should not be charged with this duty.General Weygand asked whether the Germans should be notified of the increased number of the Commission.General Bingham said that he would notify the Germans of this increase, he having an absolute right to increase the numbers of the Commission; the Americans had already been replaced by British and French officers. Fourteen French and ten British officers were now going to be appointed in addition. He.would inform the Germans that this increase in the numbers of the Commission was being made with .a view to accelerating the work of the Commission.
