CONFIDENTIAL. A.J..-166.German Peace Delegation. No, 166,Translation.M,le President,In the letter of the 17th April, of which Your Excellency will find a copy annexed hereto, a detailed statement of the German troops both in the Ruhr Valley and in the rest of the neutral zone was communicated to General Nollet, President of the Inter-Allied Military Mission of Control,   As a result of the reduction of the forces which will be completed by the 21st April, there will only remain the following effectives in the fifty kilometre zone:(a) In Section 1 and 2 (Ruhr Valley); 26 Battalions, 7 squadrons, 12 batteries, amounting in all 48 guns -a total, including Headquarters Staffs, auxiliary arins and Supply Columns, of not more than 15,500 men:(b) In Section 3 to 5j 4 l/3rd battalions, 3 squadron 0 batteries - a total of not more than 2,170. men.On the date mentioned, the number of effectives&apos; permitted in the neutral zone according to the decision of the Supreme Council of August last would, It is true, have been, strictly speaking, exceeded, namely for the infantry by 10 l/3rd. battalions, for the cavalry by 0 and for the artillery by 10 batteries.   At the same time, however, the number of officers and men of which these effectives are composed has been reduced to roughly 17,700, that is to say, the number which would be arrived at, as shown in Annex 2, if the above mentioned numbers permissible had been taken as the basis.It does not seem practicable, at the present time, to reduce these effectives which are very weak from thenumericalHis excellency the President of the Peace Conference.Paris,
numerical point of &quot;lew, by combining&apos;several together^ -seeing, that they were collected from all parts of Germany and that the units once constituted could not be broken up in order to form others without risk of seriously impairing the cohesion and practical utility of the whole force.   Further, the re-establishment of order and tranquility is a police measure rather than a military measure.   For the execution of a police measure of such a nature in this region where the population is very dense and uninterruptedly concentrated, it seems to be of special sVantage to employ small effectives with the greatest possible number of officers, headquarters staffs, etco     The actual numbers are less important than a detailed organisation,,In these circumstances the German Government begs the Allied Powers to agree that the effectives allowed should be counted only by heads in accordance with the previous suggestion of the German Governments
So far as the artillery is concerned, it is necessary that the Reichswehr, in carrying out in the basin of the Ruhr police action, full cf extraordinary difficulties, should dispose of a certain number of batteries because artillery exercises hy its mere presence strong influence on the morale and because often by that means a shedding of blood and street fighting on a large scale can be avoided.   Guns have therefore been attached as far as possible to each infantry detachment operating independently.. The German Government therefore begs that, while a definite decision as to its demand for th* maintenance of troops in the fifty kilometre zone is awaited, it may be authorised to keep in the basin of the Ruhr besides the two batteries already allowed an average of one battery for three battalions in addi-tion, which would bring the total number of batteries in the fifty kilometre zone to eleven batteries with Juch an organIsa-tton of effectives totalling 17,700 men still continuing after April 21st.&apos; The German Government believes that it will be in a position to maintain order in the fifty kilometre zone. In particular it counts on being able and hopes to be able to re-establish order as regards t&amp;e general situation south of the Ruhr without having recourse to force unless it is compelled, on account of fresh acts of violence or fresh appeals for help to employ energetic means,The German Government finds itself in the necessity of continuing to emphasise afresh, with particular insistence and ccnsciGlfctf- of its responsibility how important it is that it should be able:to answer absolutely for order, tranquility and security in the, region which constitutes the kernel of the industrial life of Germany.    If its hands were to be tied in this direction It would follow inevitably that every disturbance would spread over the entire territory of Germany, which,together
together with the resultant   fetopfMfcgO of all the arteries of economic life would bring the country ever afresh to the edge of the gulf and would thus compromise the possibility *jf fulfilling the obligations resulting from the Treaty of Peace.I remain, Monsieur le President, etc. GOPPERT.
Berlin,April 17th.1920.Monsieur le General,According to recent verification of the number of troops in the neutral zone, I have the honour to inform you as follows-: -On the 11-th April there were in the neutral zone:(a) In Sectors&quot; 1 and 2:   34 battalions, 8 squadrons, 30 batteries, including auxiliary arms and equipment (trains d&apos;equipage) -total: 22,105 men;(b) In Sectors 3 to 5; 4 1/3 battalions, 3 squadrons,, 0 batteries total: 2,171 meruThus the total effective of the German troops in the neutral zone was on the 14th April 1920, 24,276 men, of whom 6,510 were in excess of the number allowed (if not unities but effectives are taken as the basis of the quantity allowed). Further, up to the evening of April 18th 1920, about 3,000 men will be withdrawn from sectors 1 and 2 of the neutral zonej the remnant of 3,500 men will follow in three days in such a way that, once the movement is terminated, the effective allowed of 17,700 men will no longer be exoovjo^at as regards the other measures destined to regulate the occupation of the basin of the Ruhr I venture to ask to he allowed to make a further communication with the shortest delay.Please accept Monsieur le General, the assurance of my deepest consideration.-,(Sd,)   von Haniel.
