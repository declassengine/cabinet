(This document&apos;Is the property of His Britannia   Majesty1a Government).iCRET THE TRADE UNION BALLOT BILL, ^* P * 1112* v w-7Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.This Bill is to com-! up for second Reading on friday,23rd April.The Bill is expressed to be &quot;to provide that when a ballot of trade union members is taken on questions relating to strikes it shall be conducted by independent public officials and under a system of secrecy&quot;.Clause 1 of the Bill provides that in order to facilitate the taking, of a true and secret vote of the members of a Trade Union on any question relating to a proposal to stop work or arising out of a stoppage of work a Trade Union may decide that a ballot vote of its members shall be taken under the Act and thereupon the provisions of the Aot are to be observed by the Trade Union and the members thereof*The Bill proposes to constitute a Committee to be known as &quot;The Trade Union, Ballot Regulation Committee1&apos;, consisting of a representative of the President of the Board of Trade and of the Minister of Labour, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, the Chairman cf the Trades Union Congress and certain other persons nominated by the Labour Party and by the Trades Union Congress.     The Chairman of the Committee is to be the Registrar of Friendly Societies.The Bill provides that a ballot taken under the Act is to be conducted under the supervision of this Committee and the Schedules to the Bill set forth the procedure to be adopted in connection with the taking of a ballot under the Act and lay down regulations as to the proceedings of the Ballot Regulation -Committee.   The Committee are to make the arrangements for the ballot including the date on which ballot papers   are to be issued and returned.     For this purpose the Trade Union Officials are to supply the Committee with the question or questions onwhich/
3rs &apos;    iiiwhich it has been decided that a ballot shall be taken andi.the Committee are thereupon to prepare a suitable ballot ppper. The Trade Union officials are to furnish the Committee withIHthe number of the members of the Union, and the names and addresses of the Branch Secretaries,   For the purposes of the ballot the officials of the Unions are to be made Returning Officers and the necessary ballot papers are to be forwarded to the Returning Officers for distribution to the members of the Unions.   The ballot papers pre to be returned in a franked envelope to the Ballot Regulation Committee who are to count        I the votes (in the presence of representatives of the Trade Unions) and declare the result of the ballotsThe Bill provides that the Minister of Labour, on the recommendation of the Ballot Regulation Committee, is to appoint officers and clerks for the purposes of the PctaThe Bill provides that persons who for^e or fraudulentlyIdeface or fraudulently destroy any ballot papers or who threaten  1 or intimidate, or in any way interfere with the votin;; by the members of the Unions are guilty of misdemeanour under the Ballot Act.r&apos;ith the exception of the penalties under the Ballot Act foi fraud etc. in connection with the ballot the Bill does not appear jto contemplate enforcement of any kind, that is to sav, it would   1Imerely set up a machine which mirjit be utilised by the Trade Unions if they thought fit, but they are under no penalty if they should decide to continue to take their ballots *n a way to which they have been accustomeduThe.only existing statutory reference to a. ballot vote conducted by a Trade Union is contained in the Trade Union ,*ct, 1913, Section 4, which provides that when a Trade Union proposes to take a vote as to the use of its funds for political objects a ballot vote shall be taken In which every member has an equal-riiht, and if reasonably possible a fair opportunity of voting,   and in which   the secrecy/
the secrecy of the   ballot&apos;is properly secured.No doubt one of the objects of the Bill is to draw attention to the pit head voting and to the practice-which has grown up whereby a few men who may take the trouble to attend aLodge meeting can give a vote which (although those members attending are in a minority) has the effect of committing thewhole of the members of the Lodge to a particular course ofaction0    Reference will probably also be made in the debaseto what happened at the time of the railway strike last yearwhen the officials of the railway Unions were able to call astrike without the matter having been in any way subjected tothe vote of the members of the Unions.The Unions will probably point out that they are capable of conducting their business in their own way, and that they resent interference with the method whereby their members control their affairs.    But the promoters of the Bill will probably argue that the results of a ballot taken by a trade Union may have very serious effects upon other sections of the community and may result in interference with essential public services, and that therefore the rest of the community are entitled to be assured that the matter at issue will be properly placet) before the members of the Union, and will be voted upon in a proper manner.If Trade Unions are singled out for special statutory treatment in the conduct of their voting it will be because parliament is convinced that such an interference is necessary on account of what hab;transpires in the past in general &quot;Trade Union balloting.    On this point it has to be stated that there is very little evidence (apart from certain incidents at collieries) that there Is any real intimidation.    Thepractice
pract5.ce of the Unions in taking baljots vprj.es considerably. A bp Hot may he taken by a. show of hands or by a earn1 vote, at lodge or branch meetings or may be taken by p postal veto sent direct to the headquarters of the Un:&apos;ont   It would be difficult to produce adequate evidence in Support of any general allegation to the effect that Trade Union ballots are not taken in a manner ^hioh ensures free expression of opinion on the pprt of the members of the Unions.,The Rill does not, however, touch the subject of interposing some delay before p. strike takes place, and this issue may be raised in the debate,   On this subject there have been during recent months a few questions ?n Parliament, principally about the time of the railway strike, and the Trade Unions are very sensitive on the subject,The Trade Unions will certainly not give up the strike weapon pnd will not like to have it watered down.   Tt is true that certain Unions provide for a ballot vote before a. strike, notably the Dockers, Boilermakers and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers; others, however, including the National Union of Railwaymen, leave the strike decision to the Executive s Committee.   If a delay either by a ballot vote or any other method is interposed, it &quot;puts the man at a disadvantage in that it gives the employer tine to prepare to meet the strike0 If the men are compelled to ballot before a. strike, the employers should also be compelled to ballot before a lockrCUt:oIt may be mentioned that the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, makes a strike wjthout notice unlawful in the case of employees in Gas and Water Undertakings, while a. similar provision in the recent Electricity Supply Pet affects employees in Electricity Undertakings 0The opposite point of view can be seen in Ilr. Bottomley&apos;motion/
met ion put clown after the railway strike calling upon the Government at once to introduce legislation rendering Illegal any stoppage of the Public Services at the instance of Trade Union Executives without due notice and a ballot of the workers concerned..   The Middle Classes Union has decided to urge the Government &quot;to make all strikes illegal which are declared without previous resort to compulsory arbitra-tion courts and without a secret ballot under Government control&quot;In New South Wales there is a statutory provision by which in the event of a strike or a threatened strike the Minister of Labour may direct that a secret ballot shall be taken under Government supervision,Provided, of course, there should be a fair measure of assent on the labour side to the proposals in the present Bill and Parliament agreed to set up the machinery and there was some prospect of its being used, there would seem to be no reason why the Government should oppose it.     But as Labour assent is scarcely to be assumed, it seems to me that the course to pursue is to ask Labour Leaders to take note of the statements made by the promoters so that they, the Labour Leaders, may, in the first instance at any rate, take care wherever necessary to put and keep their house in order,  *1r-ukwuild myggJH? pi ujjuou to vote u^^iiraL Lliy&quot;Diil*(Signed)   T.
