\This document is the property oi His Britannic Majestys Government. - , ^--, ------, ---.-SKCKET. &apos; ^6THE CABINET.THE SITUATION IN SOUTH RUSSIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate a letter addressed to the Representative of Russia in Paris by a Russian 0164 who was in Moscow and Kieff in the years 1918 and 1919. It was brought to me 9312 by the ex-Minister of Finance, Monsieur Bark.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,ink April, 1920.Copy of a Letter addressed to Russia&apos;s Representative in Paris by a Russian who was in moscow and kleff during 1918 and 1919.Dear Sir, 2nd March, 1920.Going by the information published in the Times, a tragedy is being enacted in the South of Russia. The remainder of Russia&apos;s cultured classes of Society is now pressed against the Crimea and Novorossisk shores, and in deadly horror awaits its end. There will be no mercy for them. I left Soviet Russia later than many other persons now living in England, and know with what perfection and with what pathological extremity the extermination of the whole of the Intelligentsia, including doctors, schoolmasters, engineers and lawyers, is being carried on. The Kieff Red newspapers gave very simple reasons for such an incessantly growing number of executions: &quot;The intellectual classes of the old training are working for us insincerely and even treacherously; they are accustomed to work for the bourgeois class. They must be exterminated and a new type of intelligent people out of our own proletarian midst must be created.&quot;Having escaped from Soviet Russia in the last days of August, 1919, I maintain that even by that time Russia&apos;s cultured classes of Society were dead, either physically or morally. Some of those physically still alive were so depressed that they constantly remained in a state of stupor or madness, and were awaiting, and even longing for, death as a liberation from derision, moral torture, hunger and cold. Others again tried to accommodate themselves to the Soviet regime so as to save themselves and their dear ones. But the suspiciousness and inquisitorial instincts of the Soviet officials demanded from them such indisputable proofs of their new allegiance that they had to make the most painful bargains with their own conscience.Generally speaking, they are nothing less than living corpses, and perhaps only some of the officers are a happy exception amongst those serving for the Soviet.The officers&apos; prestige has been gradually, but systematically and openly, restored by Trotsky, and although in the beginning they joined the forces under compulsion, they are now finding some kind of consolation in the wide Imperialistic aims for attaining which the Red Army is to be used.These officers, as well as anybody else who lived in Soviet Russia during the last - months, know for certain that the present Red masters of Russia, a handful of Communist autocrats drunk with power and incomparable in their conceit, will avail themselves of the very first opportunity to bring under their yoke Bessarabia, Poland, the Baltic provinces, Caucasus, Finland, and will go even further their aspiration to conquer India is quite earnest.   Their big talk about &quot;Federation&quot; is only camouflage.(B20/199)   100   4/20  il&amp;S   8166wo
I have seen how in a few days all traces of pro-Ukrainian feelings were eradicated in the Kieff population, the Reds officially stating in their newspapers that such trivial nationalistic pretensions are only apt to obscure and to retard the advent of the great realm of Communism, common to all nations; simultaneously all the Ukrainian news-papers were naturally suppressed, and&apos;tbe disobedient editors were taken charge of by the &quot;Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Re volution.&quot;All treaties are in the eyes of Reds only respites, and they proclaim it openly in their official organs, even during the negotiations, without feeling abashed in the least. Many amongst the officers are undoubtedly captivated by the idea that the present Soviet regime will serve its purpose as the very best manure out of which a new Great Russia will spring up vigorously. If such officers are left out of consideration, then I repeat all is dead, and the pitiful remainder of Russia&apos;s cultured classes, the building of which took all her time from Peter the Great to the present day, is doomed to perdition on the Black Sea shores.It is perfectly impossible for these few ten or hundred thousand people to leave Russia : difficulties with passport visas are unsurmountable and steamers unobtainable with the exception of a few boats which speculate on the deadly horror of the unfortunate and charge many a hundred thousand roubles for a single berth to Constantinople (without food on board). How is the necessary tonnage to be procured ? Perhaps it is still not hopeless to try to arouse the Christian and humanitarian feelings of the civilized nations so that half a score of steamers might be sent in order to save what is still left of the civilized Russian people now in the Crimea and Novorossisk. They are indeed the last Mohicans of Russia, the Russia who stuck to- the Allies to her last breath ; they are the people who protested against the sale of Russia and her honour under the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, not with mere words but by their actions. People representing the civilized and true Russia have risked their lives to the very last for the dignity and honour of their Mother Country.Now their women and children will be massacred without exception. This is perfectly clear to me I escaped from Soviet Russia later than others and know that &quot; Evolution of Bolshevism &quot; spells surprising progress and refinement of atrociousness. All who remained on the wrong side of the barricades will be annihilated with a resoluteness typical of professional criminals.For God s sake consult other representatives of our dying State, and find a practical solution. I have already spoken with Russia&apos;s representative in London about the coming tragedy, and am convinced that we who escaped must organize an appeal to public opinion so as to prevent a new merciless slaughter of Russian people.Perhaps it is already too late   ....Most respectfully yours,
