Very Urgent.

Sub-Committee.

Following for the President, League of Nations.

The Supreme Council at one of its recent sittings unanimonaly accepted the proposition that Armenia should in accordance with the pledges repeatedly given by the Allied and Associated Powers at various stages of the war and since its conclusion, be constituted a free and independent Stated. It had been hoped for long that the Mandate for this State under the League of Nations, might be accepted either by America or by some European Power. In the absence however for the time being of any Power willing to undertake the task, the Supreme Council have expressed the desire, which it is proposed to incorporate in the text of the Turkish Treaty, to place the future Armenian State under the protection of the League of Nations.

This appears to them to be the sole effective guarantee at this juncture for the successful creation and the future security of the proposed State.

In these circumstances the Supreme Council are anxious to know with the least possible delay, whether the Council of the League now/



 
now sitting in Paris, will be disposed to accept the obligation.

In connection therewith ariset the question of the provision of adequate armed forces to enable Armenia to maintain her independence, and of the material resources required to promote her future economic development. The first of these subjects has been carefully examined by a special Commission, whose report has been accepted by the Conference.

The Armenians of Erivan have at present an army of some 25,000 men partially officered by trained officers of the former Russian Army. This is a framework on which the necessary measures of self-defence could be developed, and they express confidence in being able to raise 40,000 men if arms and equipment are provided. The Allied Powers are assisting in this task, and it is hoped that the first instalments will shortly be delivered.

The League of Nations, if it assumes the general protection of Armenia will be able as time passes to assist materially in the prosecution of this undertaking. The Armenian representatives hero, who are imploring the protection of the League, earnestly plead for the help of foreign officers and volunteers, if regular forces are not available, and any case for the supply of military and civil advisers.

There remains the other categories of material aid that may necessitate either now or at a later date a public appeal, which no authority could issue with an authority comparable with that of the League of Nations.

It is not thought desirable at present to make any statement with regard to the boundaries of the new State; but full information can be supplied on this subject to the Council of the League if it is so desired.

Before proceeding further with the matter, the Conference would like to know if they may hope to receive the co-operation of the League of Nations in the projected undertaking. They need not emphasise its vast importance for the settlement of the peace of the East.

FUTURE STATUS OF ARMENIA.

MEMORANDUM agreed to by the Council of the League of Nations, meeting in Paris, on April 11th, 1920.

The Supreme Council of the principal Allied Powers, being desirous of securing the existence, order, and security of the Armenian nation, has decided to form an independent Armenian Republic, whose boundaries and status will be fixed by the Peace Treaty, now in preparation, with the Turkish Empire and other international Conventions.

Lord Curzon, in his telegram of the 12th March last, enquired whether the League of Nations would agree to take the new Republic of Armenian under its protection.

The Armenian Delegation in London have defined more or less exactly the conditions under which the League of Nations might protect the Republic of Armenia.

From Lord Curzon&apos;s communication as well as that of the Armenian Delegation, it appears that the League of Nations is asked to accept a Mandate for Armenia in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 22 of the Covenant. In examining the proposals of the Supreme Council the principal concern of the Council of the League of Nations has been to determine how the independence of Armenia could most effectively be secured and order and security maintained in Armenian territory. Indeed, the Council has been guided entirely by its desire to help a nation whose misfortunes alone have given it a title to the sympathy and consideration of the  civilised world. The Council of the League is, in a word, in full accord with the Supreme Council as to the claims of the Armenian nation. It regards the establishment of an Armenian State upon a safe and independent
basis as an obligation of humanity and as an end worthy of effort and sacrifice upon the part of the civilised Powers of the world. Within the limits of its own authority it is anxious to co-operate to this end. On the other hand, the Council of the League realises its own limitations. It realises that it is not a State; that it has as yet no army and no finances, and that its action upon public opinion would to fainter in Asia Minor than in the more civilised regions of Europe. Nor can the Council forgot the bitter disillusionment of the Armenian Nation over the failure of the Armenian Clauses inserted in the Treaties of the last century. It cannot overlook the fact that the stipulations of Article 22 do not contemplate the League of Nations itself accepting and exercising a Mandate. On the contrary, these stipulations require the League to supervise the execution of Mandates entrusted to a specified Power for communities which formerly belonged to the Ottoman Empire. The supervision of the League of Nations of the vaious Mandates ontrusted to certain Powers for different regions of the former Ottoman Empire hardly seems to be compatible with the execution by the League itself of a Mandate for one of those regions. Having these considerations in mind, the Council, though it has no desire to give too narrow or pedantic an interpretation to its power, has come to the conclusion that the future of the Armenian Nation could best be assured if a Member of the League or some other Power could be found willing to accept the Mandate for Armenia under the supervision and with the full moral support of the League, under the general conditions laid down under Article 22.

But until the intentions of the Supreme Council of the Allies on certain fundamental points are clearly defined, it will be difficult for the Council to ascertain whether any Members would be prepared to accept the responsibility for such a Mandate.

1. The Government of the Armenian Republic will require substantial financial advances in order to secure, in an exhausted country, the services essential to every State. Without those essential advances the independent Republic of Armenia cannot be


constituted under satisfactory conditions.

The Council of the League of Nations is of the opinion that it would not be fair to expect the Member of the League invited to exercise a Mandate for Armenia to assume the financial responsibilities involved in such a Mandate; nor is it probably that any Member of the League would accept a Mandate under such conditions.

The League of Nations possesses no financial resources of its own. The Council is disposed to recommend the Assembly to guarantee such a loan from all the countries Members of the League of Nations. Until the decision of the Assembly can be taken the Council desires to know whether the Supreme Council of the Allies is prepared to make the necessary advances or to give a provisional financial guarantee to the independent Republic of Armenia.

II. A large part of the territory of the independent Republic of Armenia is at present under the domination of the Ottoman Empire and is occupied by the Turkish Army. The League of Nations ? no military force at its disposal is not in a position to compel the Turks to evacuate the territory of the Armenian Republic.

The Council of the League would be glad to know whether the Allied Powers are prepared to assure to the Republic of Armenia, if necessary by force, the restitution of the territories formerly belonging to the Ottoman Empire and now to be assigned to the Republic of Armenia.

Even when the territory of Armenia has been freed from Turkish troops there may for some considerable period still be need for military forces beyond the resources of a Mandatory Power. The Council of the League would wish to be informed whether, in these circumstances, the Supreme Council of the Allies is prepared to provide for the defence of Armenian territory until it can be assured by other means.

III. Any Member of the League of Nations who may be invited to accept a Mandate for Armenia, will doubtless desire to know what,if any, arrangements have been made by the draft Treaty of Peace with Turkey to secure free access to the sea for the
independent Armenian Republic, and this not only in the interests of Armenia herself but in order that full facilities of communication between the Armenian Republic and the Mandatory Power may be assured.

The Council of the League trusts, therefore, that the Supreme Council of the Allies may find it possible to notify their intention both as regards the Port of Batoum and as to the measures which will be taken to assure the future protection not only of the town but also of the lines of communication between the Port and the territory of the Armenian Republic.

Should the Supreme Council of the Allies find it possible to give the Council of the League adequate assurances on these points, the Council of the League will then undertake informal enquiries with a view to ascertaining whether any Member of the League would be prepared to accept a Mandate for Armenia under the above conditions. If those enquiries have a favourable result, the Council of the League will invite the Member concerned to communicate immediately with the Supreme Council of the Allies in order to obtain the requisite informtion relating to such essential questions as the future boundaries of Armenia and the regime to be applied to the neighbouring States.

IV. The Council does not conceal its opinion that by far the best solution of the Armenian question would be the acceptance of a Mandate for Armenia by one of the civilised Powers. Such a solution would be acceptable to Armenia conformable to the general diplomatic arrangements on which the Covenant of the League of Nations is based, and likely to be more conductive than any other plan to the efficient organisation of the new State. The Council would do its best to facilitate such an arrangement by recommending to the Assembly of the League that it should endeavour to obtain collectively from the countries of which it is composed the necessary financial guarantees for the Mandatory State. It is possible, however, that these negotiations might fail. It is conceivable though it is to be hoped not probable, that no State would be willing be assume the responsibilities of a Mandate for Armenia. In that event the Council of the League would not cease to interest itself in the fate of Armenia. On the contrary, it would be prepared to discuss in conjunction with the Supreme Council whether, in that unfortunate event, other measures could be devised for the protection of the Armenian State.

infidonti&amp;l.. J.-185.III.Hill LY TO Tiii!) Jj,a(tUjjj OI&apos;1 NaT  QUA,(Apt) rived by the  Supremo Council at ban Homo on 26th April,1920,  - 1.0.1.109(2)).The bupreme Council, sitting at Ban Aemo, has received with gratification the memorandum dated April 11th, of the Council of the League of Nations respecting the extent to which the league might be able and will in?? to co-operate in assuring the future of Armenia.     The Allied Governments desire to express their gratitude for the response of the Council of the League in a matter which the mom or and urn ri.ditly describes as an end worthy of effort and sacrifice upon the part of the civilised Powers of th e world.Before referring to the various questions formulated by the Council cf the League, the Supreme Council desires to rectify a misapprehension which appears in the early part of the memorandum under a   reply,     It was the intention of the Allied Governments to enquire as to the decree of support and assistance which might be expected from the League in the establishment of an Armenian State upon a safe and independent basis rather than to suggest .that the League should itself assume a mandate far this purpose. Itis realised that, as pointed out in the memorandum, the Leaguo is not a State and has as yot no army and no finances, and the Supreme Council fully agrees that the object in view could best bo assured if a member of the league&apos;or some other Power could be found willing to accept the mandate for Armenia.The Supremo Council has, as will be seen, been guided by this view and has indeed felt that it would bo failing in its duty if it did not make a final effort in the direction suggested. In reviewing the sources to which it might appeal one country has obviously $eon indicated net only by its natural capacities but by the fact that these have been considerably&apos;less burdened by the events of the past six years than these of the other Allied and Associated Powers.     The resources of.the United -States are relatively unimpaired and their sympathy with the Armenian cause has been coral; oil;/ r,.,rested.
Those considerations have prcmptod the Supremo Council to address itself to President Wilson.   It has frequently been suggested during the Peace Conference that the rand ate for Armenia might he undertake n by the United States but no definite of for has been made or rejected.     The Supreme Council have deemed that tho moment has now come when this step should bo made.    At its sitting of April 25th it was agreed -(a) To make ait appeal to President Wilson   that tho United States of America should accept a mandate for Armenia within tho limits set forth in Part IIIt Section V of the first print of the draft Treaty of Peace with Turkey;(b) That, v hot ever may be thc answer of the United ot&amp;tesnGove thc. subject of themot sn /mandate the President of the United States should be asked to arbitrate on the boundaries of Armenia as set forth in the draft q.rticlo below;(c) That an article in regard to Armenia should be inserted in the Iroaty of Peace in the following sense:-Turkey ane? Armenia and the other High Contracting Parties agree to rofer to. tho arbitration, of the President of tho United States of America the question of the boundary between Turkey and Armenia, in the Vilayets of 2rzerum, Tr-jbizond, VaE and&quot; Bitlis, and to accept his decision thereupon, as well as any stipulations he may prescribe as to access to tho sea for the independent state of Armenia.Pending the arbitration, the boundaries of Turkey and Armenia, shall remain ss at present.Tho boundaries of Armenia on the north and east, that is between Armenia and Georgia, and betweon Armenia and Aflerbaija shall be laid dov/n by the Supreme Council at the same time as those between Armenia and Turkey, failing a spontaneous agreement on this subject between the three Caucasian States.In order that tho Council of the Leaguo may be fully apprised of the situation, a copy of the note addressed to President Wilson in this connection is herewith enclosed.From the text of the resolution and tho note, the Council of ths Leaguo will understand that tho Allied Powers, unable by. reason of their other overwhelming responsibilities at present to assist Armenia otherwise than by tho despatch of arms and munitions, have experienced groat difficulty in fixing tho frontiers of Armenia in tho r^anr&apos;&quot;&quot; best consonant with her
San Rome-26th April,. 1920.frontiara of Armenia in the-. manner best-consonant with hor Immediate interests and future prospocts,     Tho true solution of the problem con indeed scarcely be decided upon until it is finally known whether or no the United States will accept a mandate for Armenia and, failing this, to what extent she will contribute by the provision of men or at least money to a cause which the United States Government in a recent note has itself declared to be   !the demand ana expectation of the civilised world in those circumstances a definite reply to the three specific points   raised in   the memorandum of April 11th must bo deferred for what it is hoped may prove a short period..The Supremo Council will not fail imffied lately to communicate to tho Council of tho League President Wilson1 s reply, in the liont of which the full and frank consultation, already begun with encouraging response, can if necessary be c onti nuo d or, a&apos; d eve lo po d .
