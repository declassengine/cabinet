(This document la the property of His Britooulo MajestjrMi Government).ri::Ci.M   * 3JHADB DISPUTES ACT, 1906.;p.n*55, ^.....- ........ *----------Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of labour.The following motion is to be submitted by Col, Eewman tomorrow (Wednesday);-Trades Disputes Aot, 1906, - To draw attention to the working of The Trades Disputes Act, 1906; end to move;. That this House, whilp fully recognising the value o5 organisation both among employers end employed9 is of opinion that tho existing law dees net sufficiently protect the liberty of the individual or of tho public, and oalls upon Eis Majestyrs Government to without delay appoint a Royal Commission to consider tho law dealing with restraint of trade and conspiracy, and to report at an oarly date what amendment is desirablo in the public interest. 2.   She motion will no doubt attract considerable attention and I should therefore liko to ask the advice of my colleagues as to the lino to be taken if I am called upon to intervene in the debate.3o   It is ovident frcm what transpired in the House on n Friday last during tho debate on the Bill to secure secrecy of Trade Union Ballots (a Bill to which the House gave a Second Heading -after a Division) that, concurrently with a disposition in certain quarters to lose no opportunity of criticising the position said practices of Trade Unions, thoro is a most marked sensitiveness, and a good deal of resentment,, on the part of the labour representatives towards what they regard as a policy of deliberate attack upon Trade Unionism,   m those circumstancesthey/
they will no-doubt regard the present motion fas they regarded last Friday1s Bill) as another &quot;pin-prick&quot;.   It may be noted that a demand for a Royal Commission to enquire into this matter does not come from the Employers1 Organisations, though it is they who might be expected to put forward the demand if. with their practical experience of trade disputes, they were of opinion that the circumstances justified it.4.   The events and circumstances which led up to the Trades Disputes Act Ere well known and I need not enlarge upon them at this stage.   The Act resulted from tho Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Disputes and Trade Combinations, appointed in 1903, as a consequence of the agitation which  dlXoweit the Taff Vale Judgment.5,   It iftias to be borne in mind that in recent years Trade Unions have been placed by Parliament and by successive Governments in a position of increasing responsibility and that, while the earlier legislation sought to release the unions from the disabilities vender which they had hitherto been placed, later legislation and executive action by the Governments of the day has imposed upon the Unions duties and responsibilities which have given them a position in the State of increasing Importance.   Instances of this tendency are to be seen in the national Insurance Act, 1911, the Coal Mines&apos; (Minimum Wage) Act, 1912, and the Munitions of War Act, 1915, while in innumerable cases the Government have called upon the Trade Unions to take part in the work of Executive Committees etc.6, The motion calls for the appointment of a ftoyal Commission &quot;to consider the law dealing with restraint of trade and conspiracy&quot; and the demand for the enquiry is basedupon/
upon the view &quot;that the existing law does not sufficiently protect the liberty of the individual or of the public&quot;. This suggests that evidence is available to show that, prima facie, the effects of the   Trades Disputes Act have operated adversely to the publio interest,,I am advised that it is doubtful whether adequate evidence on..these lines is forthcoming,(Signed)   T0 J, MAOMKAEA,
