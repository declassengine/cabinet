This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET.THE CABINET.THE PRESENT SITUATION IN GERMANY.MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith an interesting paper by Lieut.-Colonel Stewart Roddie, of the 0154 Armaments Sub-Commission of the Inter-Allied Commission of Control at Berlin, in 519* which he gives his impressions of some phases of the present situation in Germany.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The Wae Office, 27 th April, 1920.THE PRESENT SITUATION IN GERMANY.Berlin,14th April, 1920.The chameleon quality of affairs in Germany during the weeks which have passed since the 13th March renders it somewhat difficult to report clearly on a situation which has changed from day to day.items of interest and importance, both military and political, have been reported as they were received. It is not proposed to recapitulate these but rather to define the impression which the mass of reports and information received from various parts of Germany&apos; from our District Committees, from personal observation and from association with individuals, official and unofficial has made and left.The Kapp-Putsch might be described as a still-born child which nearly caused the death of the mother and which has left her in a state in which it is difficult to foretell whether the result is to be recuperation or insanity.The optimist builds on the stability of the German character. The pessimist tells you that the shock to its ideals has undermined this character to such an extent that it is no longer to be relied on, and adds &quot; What we have to deal with now is no longer the stable character of the German, but a workman who has tasted blood and is armed.&quot;Reichskanzler Miiller said to me two days ago &quot; The terrible truth is that the people have no longer-any &apos; National Gefilhl&apos; (Patriotism). They have nothing to look up to to respect. Before the War there was nothing in Germany that really counted as a moral or physical force but the army. That one idol has failed them and there is nothing to replace it on its pedestal.&quot;The three objectives of the people are at present: Firstly, that of the Military and Reactionaries, who every day become more and more blindly hateful of the Entente, and whose sole thought and action is directed towards the retention, by fair means or foul, of an Army, with the object thinly disguised of revenge for the &quot; shameful peace.&quot;Secondly, that of the Government and the Bourgeoisie and the wiser element of the &quot; Upper Classes,&quot; who have the honest desire to pull their country through, who have no force behind them, and who are genuine in their belief that a certain armed force in excess of that allowed by the Peace Treaty is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of order in the country. (It.is probable that the Government has been influenced by the Right to think somewhat exaggeratedly of this necessity. At the same time it is well to remember that a Government which so far is practically destitute of moral force is not going to be strong enough, to pull its sinking people out of the mire without force of some kind.) It was this party which was responsible for the sending of troops to the Neutral Zone recently, not the Military Party as has, so repeatedly, been asserted in Paris.Thirdly, the rabid Left, whose motto might be &quot; Once bitten twice shy down with all armed force but ours.&quot;(B20/197)   100  4/20  H&amp;S  S162wo
oThe position of a Government without a stable foothold, buffetted between the first and last parties, is a precarious and unenviable one, and unless they acquire some accession of moral force to compensate for the reduction of armed force, one may safely predict that their days are numbered.What will replace them ? A Labour Government ? The Labour leaders have already stated that they are not in a position to undertake the Government as they can no longer confidently rely on their own men.We come then to an element still further to the Left, and the finish can be seen without the aid of field glasses.The Government are not absolutely devoid of hope, but privately they frankly acknowledge their lack of confidence. &quot; If we can tide over the next few weeks &quot; Muller said, &quot; We may win through. An election at the present moment would be disastrous, but in a few weeks time if we can satisfy the people on the French Occupa-tion question- if we can bring about the withdrawal of the French troops if we could hold out to our people a prospect of feeding and clothing them, it might give us the strength we need. It will be a long and difficult struggle, but I am not without hope that we shall succeed.&quot;1 met the lleichshanzler, with several members of the Government and other officials a few nights ago, in a private capacity. Muller, Gessler, the new Reichswehr Minister, Albert, Reichskanzler Secretary, who was privately offered the Foreign Ministry and refused on the score that the appointment of an official of the old regime would be dangerous ; Schiffer, the former Minister of Justice, who told me that the Entente orders in connection with the Officers Trial question were to make all preparations and immediately to carry out the instructions to be given by the Allies; &quot; And now I have been ready for weeks and have not had one single reference to the subject since ! &quot; General von Seeckt, Commander-in-Chief of the Reichswehr; General Grqner, who arranged the flight of the Kaiser the democratic General before whom all pious monarchists and reactionaries make the sign of the Cross ; Noske, the strong man, somewhat embittered, somewhat hopeless of the situation, but tenacious and purposeful as ever, ready to push on in a forlorn hope. It is with profound pity that one realises this man had to be sacrificed to a diseased mob, who saw in him only the Samson whose head had been shorn by a reactionary Delilah. Noske does not admit that he was fooled by the Military. &quot; I was,&quot; he said, &quot; betrayed by one or two officers, one, the Commander-in-Chief, who was in a position, when one realises the discipline of our army, to be obeyed without question, but if I had been permitted to go out against them with 200 of my own picked men, as I wanted to do as I begged my colleagues to allow me to do I believe I would have quelled that revolution; but they would not let me do it, and who knows perhaps they were right.&quot; Muller, who was standing by, said, &quot; We knew that it would be over in a day or two. I was so certain of it that I did not even pack an extra shirt. We were only away 10 days, so I was able to make the one shirt do. I did have to buy another collar, though.&quot; (I quote this as as instance of what so many of the German people object to in the members of the Government. In spite of the outcry against class distinction, in his heart of hearts the German does not appreciate being ruled by &quot; Some one just like ourselves,&quot; which is one of the difficulties to be contended with.) Albert said, &apos;k The people need a figure-head, but where is it to come from? Hindenburg? No! Much as he is respected, he represents something which has failed, and would, therefore, never unite the country.&quot; I spoke about the appointments of Gessler to the Reichswehr and Koster to the Foreign Office. &quot; Frankly, these were appointments of embarrassment,&quot; I was told. &quot; Koster is an unknown quantity; but Gessler did not want the Reichswehr, but some une had to be found, and he consented to be sacrificed for a few weeks. We know it cannot last. Brockdorf-Rantzau or Bernstorff would have been infinitely better in the Foreign Office, but we considered it impolitic to take either of these appointments. It was felt that the fact that Rantzau had refused to sign the Peace Treaty would make his appointment unpopular with the Entente. The appointment of Bernstorff, we thought, would not be approved by America, and so, therefore well  we decided on Koster.   We are in deep water, but not in despair.&quot;Muller was the only one who seemed to regard the future with any optimism. - (The rise to Reichskanzler may have had the effect of imparting a shade of rose to his horizon.)Noske told me he still lived at the Reichswehr Office, busily engaged on private affairs, but he added that he was being consulted all day long. (The fact is that Noske is carrying on &quot; as usual.&quot;)The fear of Bolshevism does not seem to be so strong as it was in this part of
Germany. Civil war is what is feared. Attempts on the part of both Right and Left to gain a footing will without doubt take place. So long as Germany is the diseased body she is now, so long will she be the happy hunting ground of the bacilli of intrigue. It is as evident as ever that the Government requires strengthening and support.I asked Noske and Mliller what the effect of the concessions in the Auslieferungsfrage had been so far as the position of the Government was concerned. Noske said &quot; the Government had been considerably strengthened.&quot; If these concessions had not been made the whole of Germany would have united against them and the Government could not possibly have won through. As it was, it was one of factors that had aided in bringing both the Right and the Left Putsch to a head before either was properly organized, and they fought against one another instead of combining against the Government. All agreed that there would have been a general debacle had that question not been settled. (This is also my own conviction. There is little doubt that the trial question has been mainly responsible for the present state of affairs It roused the whole country to a pitch of almost frenzied indignation and the concessions came too late to ensure a return to normality.)I recently visited Meeklenberg and the Mining District of Waldenburg in Upper Silesia. Mecklenburg was bad during the last revolution, the lawless element being much in evidence but unorganized to any appreciable extent. Considerable damage to private property had been done. There were many cases of pillage and ill-treatment and some of murder. The military there were unreliable, and, being entirely without what the Reichskanzler called &quot;National Gefuhl&quot; were ready to side with whoever paid and fed them. The people, themselves, were depressed and the main feeling seemed to be &quot;anything would be better than this.&quot; In Waldenburg and in the Breslau area the workmen and Communists are well organized. Regierungsrate have been formed. Work was going on quietly but the inhabitants were jumpy, and appeared, in spite of a superficial calmness, to feel that they were on the brink of a volcano.In the &quot; Ruhr Gebiet&quot; the Red Army has disappeared armed. There is little reason, however, to suppose that they have given up the game, but rather that organization is going on, and that sooner or later, when the means of opposing them have been reduced to a minimum, a serious attempt to get the upper hand will again be made. It is true that only the minority will support such a rising, but an armed minority opposed by an unarmed majority is capable of ruining this country and the consequences of such ruin will be somewhat comprehensive.The&apos;troubles in &quot; Vogtland,&quot; according to the latest reports, appear to be subsiding, but here again the danger exists in that no arms have been given up.The recent French occupation of Frankfurt, Darmstadt, &amp;c, has, as was to be expected, raised a storm of indignation and contempt, and has augmented the already existing hatred of the French to a dangerous degree. The use of black troops has especially roused bitter wrath. The whole move is looked upon as a deliberate attempt to cause a split in the country to divide north from south. Many people state openly that they would gladly encourage a military Putsch if thereby they could see the opportunity of eventually &quot; dealing &quot; with France. The militarists are aware of this feeling, and it will doubtless encourage them to fresh and more mature effort.Pomerania at present is the cradle of a military plot. The Government is aware of it, and I was told to-day in the Reichstag that it was believed it was being well controlled. I was also told that the reactionaries were spreading a report to the effect that the Conservative parties of the Entente, especially of Britain, had let it be known to. the Conservative party of this country that in the event of another Putsch from the right the Entente would remain neutral, and that, should the Putsch succeed, they would not refuse their support.I saw Gessler to-day. Hp spoke first of the unfortunate incident in which a British newspaper correspondent was concerned (he was ill-treated by some of the Reichswehr troops in the Ruhr district). Gessler said, that while he did not wsDnt to excuse the incident, he wished to mention the following circumstances : On the correspondent was found a copy of a telegram stating that the soldiers of the Red Army were &quot; good, brave fellows.&quot; The correspondent stood, while talking with the Reichswehr officers, with his hands in his pockets (in Germany, an attitude considered contemptuous and rude). The Reichswehr, whose nerves during the civil war were somewhat overstrung, found these circumstances, combined with the fact that the mans name was&quot;Yoeght&quot; a suspicious circumstance too much for them. I told Gessler that I would mention these facts.
Gessler is very pessimistic. He admits candidly that he sees no way out for the country. They are trying to disband the army, &quot; but,&quot; he said, &quot; our troubles only increase with demobilization.-^ There is no work for these men, nowhere to send them to. They are a grave danger to the country, and, of course, will join in and support the first move against a Government which has thrown them on the street.&quot; I asked him whether he thought the Putsch would come from the Right or Left. &quot; I do not know,&quot; he said, &quot; but it makes so little difference ; the one will bring about the other, and then again Civil War. What a people ! Look at them our representatives,&quot; he said, indicating the members of the Reichstag (we were sitting in the House at the time); &quot; emaciated or flabby, not a scrap of real strength in any one of them ; under-nourished, overworked, harassed from morning till night. We ought to be strong at such a time, but here we are battered about and torn from all sides ; none of the organization or administration working properly, everything was upset during the revolution. Can you imagine what the effort to hold the threads together must be under such circumstances ?   Frankly, I have little hope.&quot;Germany, at present, might be likened to Russia during the Kerensky phase. What happened in Russia? What will happen in Germany ? The character of the people, the instincts, the education are different, and, therefore, one cannot say that the result in both cases must be the same. Also the German is beginning to realize that the Bolshevism of Russia is not justifying the doctrine of Communism. At the same time, I will here quote from a report of one of our officers in South Germany :  &quot; In South Germany the Bolshevist menace is still regarded as very serious. Well-informed circles estimate a Communist regime as imminent. The centres of agitation are Mannheim, Ranau and Friedrichshafen on the Bodensee. It is considered that 2-1 million men will be with the Red Army by the 1st of May. The opinion is becoming more general that the only salvation of Germany, the only way of escaping the Treaty, is to join hands with the Russian Bolshevism against France. If not, the German race will be slaves for a hundred years.&quot;One can, with conviction, say that until Germany can find means of employing a surplus population of which she cannot rid herself until she can satisfy the hungry and clothe the naked she is going from bad to worse.There is a heavy hill in front of this country, and the horse in the cart has scarcely sufficient strength to pull it along the level.W.
