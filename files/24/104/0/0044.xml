This Report has been approved by the allied naval., Llilitaryand Air Commission).A.J.-165.2Gth April, 1920,M, le Marechal Foch,I resident of the Interallied Military Committee, Versailles.The Allied naval advisers have the honour to forward herewith theii recommendation with regard to Articles 1, 8, ana 22 to 27 of the Report of the Committee on the administration of the ,;&apos;,aterways of the straits and the oea of iwarraora together v.ith a covering letter and explanatory notes.(ad.)

Covering Letter, .The naval Advisers in submitting the attached recommendations for the revision of certain articles in the Report of the Committee on tho Administration of the Vaterways of the Straits and Sea of Marmora (A0J,51 a) are unanimously of the opinion:-1.   That the governing principle to be followed in providing a regime for the administration of these waterways is that all vessels both of var and of commerce should have free, passage in peace and war. .   That in order to maintain this principle the precadent of the buez Canal Convention should be closely adhered to.3,     That any restrictions opposing the right of free navigation of these waterways v111 form a fruitful source of international misunderstanding.Restrictions on the passage through these waterways will interfere with the commerce of nations bordering on the Black tea.The Naval,advisers have considered the present situation vis-a-vis Russia, but are of opinion that no measures concerning thai situation should be adopted in the regime for the otraits  &apos; as the,Russian situation is not yet stabilised and this regime submitted herewith is intended for an indefinite period.4. &apos; That the Commission provided for in article Z of the above Report (A.J.51 A) i..e. the straits Commission should be chiefly composed of administrators-,and technical experts and their functions limited to the application of article 7 and other similar articles.It would appear to be logical that there should be a &quot;High Commission&quot; composed of representatives of the Guaranteeing rowers only, who would have authority over the straits Commission- which
which would be a Sub-Commission and any other Sub-Commissions such as the Customs, etc., ana would also be empowered to deal with larger issues affecting the vaterways in question, buch as are indicated in article 8 of the above i.ej ort (A.J.51 a). If, however, there are objections to this procedure the Laval advisers recommend that the status of the Commission provided for in article   of the above   Report (A.J.51 A) should be that of a DUb-CiOmmissicn as their duties are purely technical (A.J. 511).5.     ihat the provisions of article 2, whereby the   t Straits Commission exercises its control in the name of the Turkish Government, would appear to be an anomaly if the Callipoli Peninsula and the north shore of the uea of Marmora are under the sovereignty of another Power.6.     That   although article 28 (A.J. 51   A), has not been specifically referred to them fox revision, they desiie to emphasise that the regime of the straits can only be effectively assured if the whole coast and islands situated within the demilitarised zone are either under a mandate of the Guaranteeing Powers or under one sovereignty over whom the Guaranteeing lowers will have collective and positive control.Kpte^     The Japanese Naval adviser has placed a &quot;reserve on the observation concerning a High Comm:skIou contained in Clause 4, paragraph 2, pending the leceipt of instructions from his home author ities*xiiticle 1
Article 1 as drafted inThe navigation of the btraits noluding the Dardanelles,. the wea jpLarmora and the Bosphorus,. shall a future be open, both in peace -rid war (except as provided below), o the ships of the allied and ssociated Powers,. of all states, embers of the League of nations,&apos; land of states, non-members of the eaguo of Nations, on an applica-iion being made to the Council of; me league of&apos;Nations and approved iy them,, provided that such btates accept the provisions of the present oh erne.Article 1 as revised by the naval advisers,The navigation of the Straits,, including the Dardanelles, the oea of Marmora and the Bosphorus, shall in future be open, both in peace and war, to every vessel of commerce- or of war and to military and commercial aircraft without distinction of flag.These waters shall not bu subject to blockade, nor shall any right of war be exercised nor any act of hostility be committed   within them, unless in pursuance of a decision of the Council of the League of nations,Remarks of the naval Advisers on article 1.In aocordance with the views put forward in their covering letter, the naval Advisers do not consider that Article 1, as originally drafted, sufficiently allows for the principle of complete 1 freedom of the Straits1.In particular, they consider that States which are not members of the League of Nations, the United btates, for instancev will fetal a legitimate sense of injustice, if the conditions in the said article which refer to application being made to the Council of the League of nations are retained.Article 8 as drafted inA^Ja51Ayn the event of the Commission being &apos;f opinion that the liberty of lassage is threatened by external ,ction, they will inform the commander of the Allied forces, ho will thereupon be &apos;esionsible for taking any such ction as shall be best alculated. to avert such threat,Article 8 as revised by the naval Advisers,In the event of the representatives of the btates who are supplying the naval and military guaranteeing forces being of the opinion that the liberty of passage is threatened by external action, they will inform the naval and military authorities of the permanent Allied forces, who will there-upon fee responsible for taking, any such action as shall be best calculated to avert such threat,,
Remarks of the Naval Advisers on Article 8.The Naval advisers consider that, should the principle of a fHigh Commission&apos;, as recommended in their covering letter, be adopted, then the words &quot;High Commission&apos; should be substituted for the words &quot;representatives of the States who are supplying the naval and military Guaranteeing foice s&apos;.Article 22 as drafted in A * J * 51 A*ships of v ar shail be allowed free passage through the waters specified in article 3 provided they conform their movements in all respects to the regulations issued by the Commission.   Any vessel of ^ar intending to pass the Straits shall notify the Commission and shall comply with such directions as they may give. In particular, they may prescribe the number of such vessels which may at one time be within the waters under their control, the time within which the passage shall be completed, the period for which they may be allowed to anchor, and the supplies which they may be allowed to ship.Article 22 as revised by the Naval advisers.Ships of war in transit through the waters specified in Article 3 shall conform in all respects to the regulations issued by the Commission for the observance of the ordinary rules of navigation, and of sanitary requirements.-Remarks of the Naval advisers on Article 22.In recommending that this article should be revised, the Naval advisers considered that the free passage of ships of war through the waters specified in article 3 is adequately safeguarded by the provisions of article 1. and that there should be no. restrictions of any form, except such as may be required for purely administrative purposes.Ivioreover
Article 23 as drafted in Article 23 as revisedA.J.51 A. &quot;&quot;by Naval Advisors.In time of peace war like material in transit through the waters specified pin Article 3 must be declax-ed to the commission,,   In time of war munitions [of war. and contraband must bo likewise f declared to tho Commission who willlals6 have the right to visit and (To be deleted)Jsearch vessels,   N*B. Iftirther in the hvent of a war in which Turkey is a belligerent and not an aggressor, [passage of munitions of war andcontraband destined for tho enemies of purkey shall be denied by theCommission.Remarks of the Naval Advisors on article 23.In recommending the deletion of this article, the Naval Advisers desire to point out that the question of ^contraband of war1 must always be determined in war by the contraband rules laid down by the opposing belligerents, and that it is not within the province of the Commission to decide what is, and what is not contraband.Furthermore, they consider that the examination of the cargoes of merchant vessels in transit through the waterways defined in Article 3, by the Commission for the purpose of discovering &quot;war material&apos; is quite impracticable, under modern conditions.The Suez Canal Convention does not put any hindrance on the passage through the Canal of &apos;war material1 carried in Merchant vessels.TheMoreover, the Suez Canal Convention does not limit the number of warships of any Power which can be in transit through the waters of the Canal at one time, provided that no interference is caused thereby to the administration of the Canal.
\The naval Advisors are df the opinion that all questions affecting the belligerency of Turkey, and the passage &apos;war material&apos; and contraband destined for the enemies of Turkey should be determined by the League of nations, and they have therefore recommended the addition of a clause to Article 24, which should provide for these circumstances.Art ic le^24 jas jdraf ted^ in ITT. 51&quot; A,Without derogating from the [revisions of Articles 1 and 22 plicable to all vessels of war, tioto belonging to a belligerent hall not rovictual nor take in ay stores within the waters lad or the control of the commission except so far as may e strictly necessary to enable hem to complete the transit of he Straits and to reach the nearest ort where they can call, nor hall they add to the number of heir crews or in any way add toir fighting efficiency^   no epairs shall be effected if the amage was due to hostile action, or in any case beyond what may be ecessary to enable the vessels o keep the sea.   Tho transit of uch vessels shall bo effected ith the least possible delay, hey shall not remain in such aters longer than twenty-four ours from the departure of a essel of war of the other elligorent.In the event of war in which turkey is the belligerent and not he aggressor, passage through such /ater shall be denied by the ommissicn to vessels.; of TurkeyTs nemies.Article 24 as revised by the 1avil&quot;&apos;^dvisefsT      &apos;(i) Vessels of war of belligerents shall not revictual or take in stores except so far as may be strictly necessary to enable them to complete the transit of the Straits and to reach the nearest port where they can call, nor shall they replenish or increase their supplies of war material or their armament, or complete their crews, in the waters under the control -of the Commission, or in the free ports of Constantinople and Haida pasha..

The Commission shall decide what repairs are necessary, and these must be carried-out with the least possible delay.(. ii)   The transit of vessels of war of belligerents through the waters under the control of the Commission shall be effected with the least possible delay, a without any other intermission than that resulting from the necessities of the service.(iii)   Their stay at ports within the jurisdiction, of tho Commission or in the free ports of Constantinople and Haida Pasha shall not exceed 24 hours except in case of distress-    In such case they shall be bound to leave as soon as possible.
