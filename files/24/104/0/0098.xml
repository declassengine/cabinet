Nil.Part II. Departmental.Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Scheme.In the work of resettlement the assistance given by the Ministry of Labour through its administration of the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Scheme continues to be of very considerable importance.The earlier scheme, that of 1916, instituted for the benefit of officers and men with the Forces, continues to attract a certain number of applications, but the number , is not very large. In round numbers some 475,000 applications have been received under this scheme, but the main work of the Department now consists in the administra-tion of continuous grants sanctioned at various times in the past. Over 313,000 grants have been sanctioned, of which, approximately, 4,600 are still in operation. The amount expended is about  10,000,000.Under the later scheme, however, that of 1919, designed to promote the resettlement of officers and men after leaving the Forces, a steady How of applications for assistance still continues. On the 10th April, including appeal cases, over 236,000 applications had been received. The number received since the middle of November, 1919, is considerably more than twice as great as had been received before that date. The weekly number of applications shows little signs of falling off, and for the week ending the 17th April amounted to over 10,000. About 70,000 grants have been made under this scheme, involving a sum of over  1,750,000.   In some 80,000 cases no grant has been made; a(c 1989)  150  5/20 h &amp; S 2 C
large number of these, however, are coming under revision through recent changes in regulations. Over 6,000 applications have been withdrawn. Arrears of work in connection with this scheme, it may therefore be claimed, are almost completely over-taken.  There still remain 12,000 cases to be dealt with in whole or in part.Assistance under thislater scheme has been given in far the greater number of cases as a lump sum grant. Approximately 64,000 such grants have been made, while only in some 5,000 cases have continuing grants been awarded. A large majority of the applications granted are for assistance in the re-establishment of business, but a very substantial number of applications are still being received for the provision of tools to enable workmen to resume their previous occupation, or for disabled men who, although they have been in employment before the war, find that they can no longer return to their former occupation, and require assistance to set up suitable businesses of their own.Some disappointment has been caused in the past by the fact that the Ministry were restricted in the administration of the scheme to cases where, if the man had been demobilised before the Armistice, application was made before the 30th September, 1919, and in other cases to applications made within a year from the date of discharge. This provision, it was found, was liable to inflict some hardship upon disabled men who were still receiving medical treatment or training, and were, therefore, not at the time able to enter into civil life. Special provision has, therefore, recently been made to extend the time limits within which disabled men who have been under medical treatment since demobilisation may apply for assistance under the scheme and consideration is to be given to the question of some further extension.Part III. The Labour and Socialist Press. Topics of Discussion.It was noticed in this I(eport* last week that the writers to the Labour and Socialist Press were becoming weary of the acrimonious discussions which have been proceeding since January on the relations which should subsist between the various Socialist bodies in England and the various international socialist movements, and upon other internal matters. This week there is almost a complete cessation of this kind of discussion, the only exceptions being a controversy between &quot; The Call&quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought,&quot; arising out of a criticism in the latter of the British Socialist Party annual con-ference, and a bitter criticism of Miss Sylvia Pankhurst in &quot; The Call &quot; by Mr. F. Willis. It was suggested last week by &quot; Justice,&quot; the &quot; Clarion &quot; and Mr. Philip Snowden that this discussion should give place to socialist propaganda, but it is worthy of note that it has, in fact, given place to criticism of Government policy, in particular of the Budget.The Budget.The discussion of the Chancellors Budget speech is voluminous. Mr. A. M. Thompson in the &quot; Clarion &quot; is the only person to express satisfaction with it. All the other papers are very critical, but the level of criticism is remarkably low. As an example the following argument from the i( Labour Leader&quot; maybe quoted: &quot;Included in the estimated revenue is a sum of  310,000,000 expected to be derived from the proceeds of the sale of war materials: the new taxes are expected to realise in a full year about  200,000,000. Therefore . . . the position is that, when receipts from surplus assets are exhausted, we shall be  110,000,000 a year short of making expenditure and income balance.&quot; The fact that there is an estimated surplus on this years&apos; Budget of  234,198,000 is met simply by regarding it as &apos;a manipulation of figures.&apos; The expendi-ture side of the estimated Exchequer balance-sheet for 1920-21 is criticised in the &quot; Democrat &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen,&quot; which both insist upon the urgent need for a, drastic reduction in public expenditure. The bulk of the criticisms are, however, upon the income side of this balance-sheet: the Labour and socialist Press tends usually to the opinion that the expenditure side is not big enough for the health of the country. To take in turn the various proposals for new taxation, it may be noted that the increase in the rate of the Excess Profits Duty receives very little approval in these papers. The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; the &quot; Nation &quot; and &quot; Justice &quot; criticise this tax&apos; as being unfair and as lending itself to evasion, while the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; makes the unfounded remark that this tax &quot; appears to be a dwindling source of revenue.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; goes so far as to argue that the abolition of the Excess Profits Duty would not make much difference to the total revenue, as a considerable amount of revenue lost would be* Page 191.
(C 1989)* Cf. this Report, 14th May, 1919, page 7.202regained by the operation of the ordinary Income Tax and the Super-Tax. It will be remembered that the criticism of the 1919 Budget in the Labour and Socialist Press was concentrated upon the reduction in the Excess Profits Duty.* Since then these papers would appear to have absorbed the ordinary commercial criticism of this tax. The Corporation Profits Tax is regarded by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; as an unnecessary duplication-tion of the Income Tax, while the &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; argue that it is an unfair imposition upon one type of trading organisation, and that it will be raised equally from the poor and the rich. These papers, of course, regard it as an axiom of public finance that a flat-rate tax must be inferior to a graduated tax, although there are cases in which this is doubtful. Complaints about the increased postage rates are frequent, but the customs and excise duties meet with criticism only in the I.L.P. papers, and especially in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; not because of any objection on the part of these papers to additional taxation of wines, spirits, beer and cigars, but because it is thought that too great a part of the new taxation is indirect. These criticisms lose in their value, however, from the fact that they are based upon the revenue estimated to accrue during the current year from these increases, and not upon the estimates as to the product of the whole of the new taxes for a full year. The inclusion of the Disposal Board&apos;s receipts in the ordinary revenue of the Exchequer is severely criticised in the I.L.P. papers and by the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; as being dishonest finance. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; has a theory that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should produce his Exchequer balance-sheet in the form of a statement of assets and liabilities rather than of revenue and expenditure, and, criticising the Budget on this basis, argues that the net indebtedness of the Govern-ment will be increased during the current year. The fact that the proposed Corporation Profits Tax will apply to co-operative societies was not realised until the Wednesday or Thursday of last week, too late for notice in any of these papers. The statement that this Budget, as a whole, will do nothing to solve the problem of high prices is very generally repeated, but no arguments are advanced to show how the Budget could solve this problem. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; believes that the most effective means of dealing with this problem are the funding of the floating debt and a capital levy.The Trade Union Movement.The opinion that the Trade Union movement should concentrate upon securing a general reduction in prices rather than upon securing a series of separate wage advances for the various organised bodies of workers was very prevalent last week, and apparently originated in a statement to this effect by Mr. Smillie in the course of the miners&apos; ballot. This opinion is being taken up very strongly by the I.L.P. papers and this week it is put forward with special reference to the threatened cotton textile dispute. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour leader,&quot; urges that any stoppage of work in the cotton textile industry will have a disastrous effect upon rates of exchange and consequently upon the course of prices, and his opinion is repeated by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in a leading article. Mr. Snowden, too, criticises the operative spinners for declining to accede to the suggestion of their employers that their claim should be referred to Government arbitration. Mr. Snowden apparently would like to see a public enquiry into the cotton textile industry similar to the enquiries into the coal industry and the conditions of employment of dock labour. The trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; discusses the possible cotton dispute from the point of view of trade union organisation. He is doubtful how far the organisation of cotton operatives is suited to modern conditions. He suggests that, should a strike take place, the opportunity should be seized upon by cotton workers to establish a system of shop stewards and to construct upon shop steward committees in the various factories an industrial organisation of cotton textile operatives. It will thus he seen that the attitude of the official journal of the I.L.P. towards the cotton workers in Lancashire, is remarkably different from the attitude it has adopted in the railway, coal mining and other disputes. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; contains a fighting article against the employers for their replies to the various operatives&apos; demands.Government Policy.Criticisms of the Department of Overseas Trade, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour may be noted.  The debate in the House of Commons on Monday, April 12th, on the Overseas Trade (Credit and Insurance) scheme is noticed in the Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot; New Age.&quot;  The &quot; New Age &quot; argues that this scheme
Paet IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Week.The outstanding feature of the week is the position in the cotton textile industry. On the 26th inst., the results of the ballots taken by the operative cotton spinners and the card and blowing room operatives were announced, and showed overwhelming majorities in favour of a strike. The weavers had already lodged strike notices to expire on the 1st May. A series of negotiations has, however, taken place between representatives of the Ministry and the parties concerned, and the prospects of a settlement are now more hopeful. The Northern Counties Textile Workers&apos; Federation has, on behalf of the weavers, accepted arbitration ; and an important conference between Sir David Shackleton and the Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation, the Operative Cotton Spinners and the Card and Blowing Room Operatives took place on the 29th April.will mean an immediate increase in prices at home with no prospect of anything but further increases if the scheme is successful in fostering British export trade to Central Europe. Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; begins an article on the scheme but, obviously finding it beyond her power to comprehend the workings of the scheme and to make effective criticism of it, tails off into an attack upon Colonel Malone for pressing his opposition to the project on utterly wrong grounds.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; complains that discussion upon the housing question has become an affair of all-round recriminations and asks why the Minister of Health does not encourage the spread of &quot; direct labour &quot; schemes as the only promising way of solving the difficulties. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; contains an article by Mr. Ben Riley propounding a proposal whereby two-thirds of the cost of housing schemes may be defrayed by a tax of 1 per cent, on wages bills. Mr. Riley states that this scheme has been developed in Huddersfield and he chooses Huddersfield as his example in showing its feasibility. On his own figures, his scheme would only allow of the building of 83 houses per annum in this town in any one year. It is thus difficult to see that this proposal is any more valuable than the previous proposals, emanating from Bradford and Wigan, for the financing of housing schemes.It has been observed in previous issues of this Report that the trade union correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; on every possible occasion compares Industrial Councils with Trade Boards to the advantage of the latter. It would appear, however, that he is beginning to think that he has in the past been too enthusiastic in his praise of Trade Boards. This week he expresses fear that the Ministry of Labour is tending to take more power into its own hands and to turn the Trade Boards more and more into advisory bodies. He urges workers to see that their representatives on these Boards should gain rather than lose power, and suggests that appointed members of Trade Boards should be dropped as early as possible and the Trade Boards converted into ordinary Boards of Conciliation.Ireland.The Irish general strike is noticed in &quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Socialist &quot; as a triumph of direct action over parliamentarianism. The Trade Union Correspondent of the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; however, is more interested in it as a proof of the power of the Irish Transport Workers&apos; Union. He claims that this union approximates to the &quot; One Big Union.&quot; This correspondent^ low opinion of trade union organisation in England is always a noticeable feature of his articles.Foreign Affairs.&quot; The Call&quot; contains an article of the usual kind exhorting the workers to make the object of their May Day demonstrations the expression of solidarity with Russia. Fear is expressed in this article that the Allied Powers are again meditating a renewal of war with the Soviet Government.The forthcoming International Financial Conference at Brussels is noticed in the &quot; Nation.&quot; It is complained that Austria, Germany and Russia are not invited to send representatives to the conference, and attention is drawn to the separate representation of British Dominions. &quot; To point out that a League which excludes Germany and Russia and multiplies the British Empire by six cannot serve as a mirror of European opinion, would be to betray a lack of humour.&quot; The &quot; Nation &quot; regards this conference as a more formal meeting of the League of Nations than it really is, but these hasty remarks are typical of the criticism of the League of Nations and similar international bodies at present current in the Labour and Socialist Press.
Otherwise the week has been uneventful. Negotiations have continued on some of the wage demands to which attention was directed last week, but no important developments have taken place. A large number of demonstrations have been arranged for May Day, but there is no suggestion in any responsible Labour quarter that anything in the nature of a general strike should take place.The Unemployment Position.The increase in the number of H.M. Forces Policies remaining lodged for the week ended the 16th April, 1920, was 6,315 compared with a reduction of 10,522 between the 1st April and the 9th April. The number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 16th April, 1920, was 220,418 composed of 218,114 by men and 2,304 by women..72,122 Unemployment Books remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 16th April making a reduction of 3,097 since the 9th April, 1920. At the latter date there were 50,453 books lodged by males and 24,766 by females (a total of 75,219) and at the 16th April the number of books lodged by males was 47,868 and by females 24,254.At the 9th April, 103 policies remained lodged by short time workers of which 72 were in the insured industries (79 -1 per cent, being in the Engineering and Ironfounding group) and 31 in the uninsured. At the week ended the 2nd April there were 140 short time policies remaining lodged, and 467 at the 12th March, 1920.The total live register at all Employment Exchanges for the week ended the 16th April, 1920 was 286,342 men, 48,641 women, 26,479 juveniles, compared with 288,023 men, 46,023 women, 24,350 juveniles a week ago (9th April) and 322,616 men, 51,487 women, 20,527 juveniles at the 19th March, 1920.Retail Prices of Food.In connection with the index number showing the general level of the retail prices of the principal articles of food, which at the 1st April averaged 135 per cent, above the general level of July, 1914, it may be noted that a considerable increase may be expected to be revealed by next month&apos;s statistics, as a result of the reduction of the flour and bread subsidy, which first affected retail prices on 12th April.Unemployment Insurance Bill.Local branches of trade unions continue to pass resolutions protesting against the amendment to this Bill made in Standing Committee, providing that a friendly society might be regarded as an association of employed persons for the purposes of the Act. On the other hand, at the annual meeting of the Midland Societies&apos; Federation on the 24th April a resolution was passed protesting against any arrangement being made in the Unemployment Insurance Bjll which would place the national friendly societies in an unfair position as compared with other societies under the Insurance Act. A conference of friendly societies&apos; delegates will be held on the 29th April to decide their attitude. It is reported that the executive of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union has decided to endeavour to form a scheme for the distributive trades to contract out of the Bill. Preliminary con-ferences have taken place with the Drapers&apos; Chamber of Trade, and the Grocers&apos; Federation has been communicated with. It is reported that workers in the printing industry are anxious to secure a special scheme under the Bill.Labour Party Conference.The preliminary agenda for the Twentieth Annual Congress of the Labour Party to be held at Scarborough on the 23rd June has been issued. The National Executive proposes that the affiliation fee for trade unions and other organisations should be raised by 50 per cent, to 3d. per member. This proposal it may be remembered was put forward at the Southport conference last year but was not then approved. The committee points to the need for improved organisation in the constituencies and the possible expenses in connection with international developments. The policy of the party with regard to its international affiliation will be one of the most important subjects of debate. Resolutions are on the agenda in favour of secession from the Second International, and also in favour of the summoning of a new international congress including members of the Second and members of the Third Internationals. Certain local Labour Parties suggest a resolution instructing the national executive to consult the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress with the object of formulating a programme embodying nationalisation with democratic control of the mines, railways, land and food distribution, and including a levy on capital as a means of reducing the national debt.
May Day.The movement in favour of a holiday on May Day has been almost universal through-out the country. A very large number of trade unions have applied to their respective employers&apos; associations for a holiday on that day. In most cases the request has been refused, but in some it has been granted. There is, however, very little talk of a strike on that day, though it is certain that a large number of workpeople will absent themselves from work.  Demonstrations will be held in all parts of the country.Nationalisation.At the joint meeting of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Executive of the Labour Party, the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and representatives of the Co-operative Movement, held at the House of Commons on the 21st April to consider the position of the mines nationalisation campaign, it was decided to refer the question to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress to consider ways and means for giving effect to the decision of the recent special Trades Union Congress in favour of intensive propaganda. In South Wales the attitude of the miners towards nationalisation is an interesting one. The South Wales miners are in favour of nationalisation, but as they are afraid that they may have to wait long to obtain it, they are agitating for the immediate decontrol of the industry. They object to the inter-mediate position which it holds, and maintain that if it is not to be nationalised out and out, it should not be differentiated from any other industry. Free play should be granted to the law of supply and demand to operate on prices and wages. The South Wales miners contend that with the prevailing high prices for South Wales coal they are entitled to a higher wage, and as they are not getting it the coal industry as a whole is being subsidised at their expense, and other industries in which coal is used are also being sub-subsidised. Particular reference is made to the cotton trade in regard to which it is held that the extra profits which are being made are due to some extent to the fact that the coal supplied is subsidised from the profits of the South Wales export trade. There is a strong movement in favour of making the South Wales coal industry a self-contained whole, and it is reported that the May Day demonstration is to take the form mainly of propaganda in favour of nationalisation or decontrol.The Building Guild Movement.It is reported that the Manchester Building Guild has opened a register for operatives who wish to work under guild conditions. The immediate response is said to run into hundreds of workmen, a substantial number of whom are bricklayers, and the Guild Committee is greatly encouraged by the readiness with which workmen are prepared to support the ideal which it is endeavouring to realise.Association of British Chambers of Commerce.At the annual meeting of this Association on the 21st April and subsequent day, resolutions were adopted calling for an enquiry to determine whether the Employment Exchange system as now administered fulfils its original objects and warrants its increas-ing cost, urging the Government to appeal to employers&apos; federations and to trade unions for a temporary extension of the present working hours in order to meet the deficiency in production, declaring the opinion of the conference that any further reduction in working hours would inflict irreparable injury on the trade of the country, and also urging the Government to discourage any administrative or legislative measures in the direction of increasing municipal trading.National-Conference of Labour Women.This conference took place on the 21st and 22nd April. 410 delegates were present, of whom 286 represented women&apos;s sections of local labour parties in the metropolitan area, 90 represented trade unions and 34 represented national societies affiliated to the National Labour Party or the Standing Joint Committee of Women&apos;s Industrial Organisations. Arising out of a report on the Washington International Labour Conference presented by Miss Margaret Bondfield, a resolution was adopted giving the support of the conference to the convention concerning the employment of women before and after childbirth, and calling for a Government Bill to provide benefits for mother and child on a universal and non-contributory basis. A resolution was also passed pointing out the need of pro-vision for the continued part-time education of all boys and girls up to 18 years of age with adequate maintenance grants, and for the total prohibition of overtime and nightwork
for women workers and for its general prohibition except in special emergency for men workers. A resolution was also carried congratulating the Labour Party on its effort to secure equal civic and political rights for men and women.&apos;/National Unionist Labour Conference.Three hundred and fifty delegates from the Midland counties attended a National Unionist Labour Conference at Leamington on the 24th April, 35 trade unions being represented. Resolutions were adopted condemning the nationalisation of mines, land and industries and urging trade unionists not in sympathy with the policy of the &quot; Socialist Labour Party &quot; to exercise the privilege of claiming exemption from contributing to the political funds of their respective unions.Union of Democratic Control.A conference under the auspices of this body was held on the 24th April. Speeches were made by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, Mr. C. P. Trevelyan, Mr. E. D. Morel and Mr. J. Mills. A resolution was passed declaring the opposition of the conference to all forms of industrial and military conscription.Trade Union Topics.National Federation of Building Trade Operatives. The Executive Committee of this Federation have decided that, for a period of seven days, they will not sanction overtime work by any of their members. This decision has been taken in order to celebrate the coming into operation of the 44-hour week in the building trade.Amalgamated Society of Engineers. Dalmuir branch of this union has passed by a majority of 10 to 1 a resolution against piecework.Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen. This body has reached an agreement with the more recently formed Architectural Draughtsmen&apos;s Association under which the former society agrees not to accept purely architectural draughtsmen, while the latter agrees to leave steel structural draughtsmen to the A.E.SJD.YorJcshire Cotton Operatives Union. It is reported that this union is taking steps to bring into its organisation local unorganised workers in the cotton mills in the neigh-bouring Midland counties. Cotton operatives in the densely populated Lancashire centres have been almost completely organised for many years, but it is only comparatively recently that cotton workers in Yorkshire have been organised, and the scattered workers in Midland counties are still very largely unorganised.General Union of Textile Workers. This union recently endeavoured to secure an agreement with the employers in the woollen and worsted industry for the elimination of non-unionists from all mills. The employers, however, declined to consider the sug-gestion, and it is reported that the Union of Textile Workers has now referred the matter to the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trade with a view to joint action in the matter by the whole of the organised workers. The operatives attach special importance to this question at the moment in view of the proposals which are being made for the establishment of a special scheme for the woollen industry for contracting out under the Unemployment Insurance Bill.Ex-Service Men.The first ordinary meeting of the Standing Joint Committee for ex-Service Questions was held last week at Montagu House. At the morning meeting, presided over by Sir Montague Barlow, questions affecting ex-officers were considered by the Officers&apos; Panel of the Committee and the official representatives concerned. Major Try on, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions, was present. In the afternoon session, questions affecting other ranks were considered by the Other Ranks Panel under the chairmanship of Major Try on. Sir Montague Barlow attended this meeting. A further meeting of the full committee was subsequently held under the chairmanship of the Minister. At this meeting the constitution and objects of the Standing Joint Committee were formally approved.Labours International Relations.Trade Union International. At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Federation of Trade Unions held in Amsterdam recently, a number of resolutions were passed.  Affiliated organisations were called upon to stop work on the
1st May and hold demonstrations in favour of an 8-hour day and the socialisation of the means of production. Resolutions were adopted approving of the attitude adopted by the bureau of the International with regard to the International Labour Conference at Washington and supporting the maritime conference which is to commence at Genoa on the 15th June. South Africa and Greece were admitted to membership of the Inter-national, the latter country with the reservation that its entry must be confirmed at the next full congress. The meeting urged the necessity of appointing members of the trade union movement as attaches at embassies, to enjoy similar rights to those of commercial attaches. It was stated that efforts were being made to induce the trade unions in Japan, India, Australia and South America to join the International.Second International. The agenda of the tenth congress of the Second International to be held on the 31st July in Geneva includes the following subjects: The adoption of the constitution of the International; the question of international unity ; questions of responsibility for the war; matters of general international policy including peace and the League of Nations, democracy versus dictatorship, socialisation, the political system of socialism, labour legislation, colonial policy, emigration and the high cost of living.  The organisation of the Labour and Socialist Press will also be considered.The British Labour Movement and Hungary. The Executive of the Labour Party and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the 21st April appointed representatives to visit Hungary. These are, in the case of the Labour Party, Messrs. F. W. Jowett, J. Wedgwood and W. Harris, and in the case of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union^Congress, Messrs. G. H. Stuart Bunning and J. B. Williams.T. J. MACNAMARA.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to :-Intelligence Division,Ministry op Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London. S.W. 1.
