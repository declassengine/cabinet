This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.SECRET, llvi    M i&apos; &apos; - &apos;CV*THE CABINET.BATOUM,MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The attached telegram from General Milne makes an early decision on the evacuation of Batoum imperative.It appears to me inherent in the decision to abandon the Caspian and acquiesce in the destruction of the Uussian volunteer armies that we should definitely accept the complete loss of all control in the Caucasus, and should effect a general withdrawal of our posts and curtailment of our responsibilities throughout Kurdistan and Persia. There were advantages in a strong policy. There are other advantages in a weak policy. There are no advantages but only dangers in a policy which, having thrown away all the effective forces and situations, nevertheless clings on at enormous expense without adequate military force to a series of interim positions.The safety of the single British battalion in Batoum is a &apos;direct matter on which ;i decision must be taken.W. S. C.The War Office,mh April, 1920.__ft   Telegram to War Office from General Officer Commanding, Constantinople. (No. G.C. 554.) 26th April, 1920.Clear the line.   Defence of Batoum.1. Plostile forces to be considered are Bolshevist. Georgian, Turkish. There is no real ground for assuming that Bolshevists do not intend (?) recapturing whole of former Russian Empire. Georgians do not intend to resist Bolshevists and once the latter humiliate (?) Georgia whole country will become Bolshevist. Turkey already contemplates attempt against British (see my telegram I.E., 13th April) and might combine to expel Allies2. Enemy numbers : Bolshevists, 35,000 ; Georgians, 30,000 ; Turks, 10,000 regulars, 20,000 irregulars; 30,000 Kurds and Tartars.3. Attack from all land sides must consequently be considered. Essential that town and docks be free from hostile shell fire, owing to danger of conflagration from enormous quantities of oil exposed in elevated tanks and to the necessity of free entrance to harbour. Town of 70,000 inhabitants, containing large Bolshevist element, serious risings must be expected. Precipitous and complicated hill system, merging into mountains,, commands town from north-east and south-east.4. Topographical considerations render naval (?) low trajectory fire practically useless for purposes of defence, excepting on flanks and in vicinity of coast. Allied garrison of one brigade essential to maintain order in town, and in no way available for defensive purposes.5. If town is to be defended food for inhabitants and troops must be wholly provided from sea.6. There is an old Russian defence system of forts covering Batoum at a radius of 2 to 4 miles (see my report forwarded (?) to you numbered 58 (?) 79, 11th February, 1919). Russians estimate force required was 16 infantry battalions, 2 battalion sappers, 2 squadrons cavalry, 200 guns, excluding machine guns. This line leaves the town open to hostile artillery fire and is dilapidated and out of date and there are no guns.7. Most suitable defensive position runs from sea to 2 miles south of Kobuleti, by hills 11 60 and Chertunaga, to point 14 40 on Turkish border and to sea near Linnan with a perimeter of oO miles, Northern front strong by nature; other fronts much work required; field of fire poor. This is the only sound tactical position. Town of Batoum can be defended. Measures : Against troops we are likely to meet absolute minimum of troops required is 2 divisions with 2 brigades of mobile artillery and full administrative and supply service. Though perimeter might be somewhat reduced, number of troops required would not be correspondingly affected, owing to avenues of approach remaining the same. .8. Owing to the situation in Constantinople not a single Infantry or Artillery unit can be spared. As I have already stated, proper defence of Batoum lies in the pass of the Caucasus. Once Bolshevists have (?) passes of Georgia there can be no possible advantage to anyone in retaining Batoum. It should be borne in mind that the problem of strength of the garrison necessa ry to maintain order in the town is an entirely different one from that of the strength of force necessary to defend it.(B20/202)   100  4/20   H&amp;S   8170vvo
