This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.l4SECRET.TiiESORT BY GENERAL SHAW ON THE PRESENT SITUATIONIN IRELAND.THE CABINET.MEMOEANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a report and covering letter from General Shaw on the present situation in Ireland.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office, &apos;22nd April, 1920.General Headquarters, Ireland,Parkgate, Dublin.Sir, 27th March, 1920.For the information of the Army Council, I forward herewith a statement setting out my view of the situation as it exists at the moment. This statement was begun a few days ago, before I was aware that the decision to replace me in command, immediately, had been arrived at; but the imminence of my relief makes it, I think, more desirable still that the Council should be in possession of my views.Since the Rebellion at Easter in 1916, the state of the country has gone steadily  and is still going from bad to worse.Clever men at the head of the rebel movement saw clearly that without a better organization they had no chance of success; and the leniency with which they were treated, and the sympathy which they received encouraged them to hope that they would be able to train and organize without serious interference.They were justified in their confidence. The system which they have built up is a remarkable one ; the so-called &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; is organized and commanded in a manner which would be creditable to highly-trained military experts ; its communications and intelligence services are most efficient, and its discipline leaves little to be desired.The failure to enforce conscription, which was fully expected and would have been accepted after the Rebellion, and which, in my opinion, was always possible until the end of the War, has left, the country teeming with young men, ripe for mischief, who have readily fallen into the net spread for them by the rebel leaders. It is only want of armament which has prevented the &quot;Irish Republican Army&quot; becoming a most formidable and open enemy.Whatever the reasons may have been for such shortsighted policy, the fact remains that, for two years after the Rebellion, &quot; drilling &quot; was openly and practically without opposition carried on all over the country.And it was this &quot;drilling&quot; which made possible the discipline and organization which is so apparent at the present time.The time for leniency and &quot; sympathy &quot; has gone past, and it is only by the most drastic and repressive action that we can hope to deal with the situation. Thanks to the energy and cool personal courage of the officers of my intelligence staff, we are now in possession of the threads of the conspiracy, and the heads of it must be. and, I hope, soon will be, arrested and placed in security.At the moment I see no reason to apprehend overt and general rebellion, but the menace is always with us, and local outbreaks may occur at any moment. And such outbreaks, unless they are destroyed in the bud, are likely to develop quickly.The numbers for which I have always asked in terms of efficient &quot;rifles&quot; would be sufficient to meet the situation, but in some respects, notably infantry, the signal service, and more especially the &quot; wireless &quot; personnel of that service, we are lamentably deficient.(B20/184)   100  4/110  h&amp;s   8143wo
The Military Situation in Ireland, 25th March, 1920.Towards the end of 1919 the activities of the Irish Volunteers (or &quot; Irish Republican Army,&quot; as some of their supporters like to call them) became far more pronounced. During the whole of the year (1919) they had persistently and quietly carried out raids for arms on police barracks and private houses, and occasionally they had attacked members of His Majesty&apos;s forces (e.g., the raid on Collinstown aerodrome on 20th/21st March, 1919, and the attack on the party of soldiers at Fermoy on 7th September, 1919).Since December the outrages and attacks carried out by Irish Volunteers have been more frequent and bolder. The objects of the outrages are two fold (a) to obtain arms and (b) to terrorize the police and law-abiding section of the community. The reasons for the increased activity were many - - the failure of their cause at the Peace Conference and realization by the extremists that there was no hope for the Republican Cause except in force (vide No. 14 Vol. 1 Ant&apos; Oglach)  determination to thwart the Governments efforts to introduce a Home Rule Bill (a half measure from their point of view) the energy of their leaders the inflamatory doctrines preached by the Ant&apos;Oglach, the official journal of the Irish Volunteers, which is issued to every officer the increased supply of arms and ammunition  the longer nights which facilitated concealed movement  the immunity from damage and arrest, and apathy or passive approval of the vast majority of the law-abiding population.It became obvious before the end of 1.91.9 that matters had got beyond the power of the police to handle. They had been given the active support of troops whenever possible, but searches for individuals and arms generally failed, and their channels of communication by post and telegraph were unsafe.After deep consideration, therefore, I decided early in January, 1920, to recommend to His Excellency the Lord Lieutenant that the Military Forces, in Ireland should take a more active part in dealing with the situation.A. copy of my report to His Excellency was sent to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the 3rd January, 1920. Briefly, the proposal put forward was to arrest and deport under Defence of the Realm Regulations 14b directly an outrage occurred, the heads of the Irish Volunteer movement., i.e., commanders and officers, in the immediate neighbourhood.In order to ensure secrecy and co-ordination of action between the troops and the Royal Irish Constabulary it was proposed that the orders for such arrests should he issued by the local Military Commanders in their capacity as competent military authorities and not by the Police authorities.The reasons why deportation was necessary and why prosecution was impossible in most cases are obvious to all who know the present situation in Ireland, and realize that no witness can come forward and give evidence against a member of the Irish Volunteers without running grave risk of assassination. Nor is it possible to induce any Jury outside parts of Ulster to convict even on the clearest evidence.His Excellency approved of the proposed plan which was put into operation on 31st January, when a large number of Irish Volunteer leaders and officers in Dublin and in the counties of Cork and Clare, Limerick and Tipperary were arrested and deported. In the four counties named 80 per cent, of the individuals &quot;wanted&quot; were found, but in Dublin itself 12 out of 1.8 were absent when searched for. I may mention here that the selection of individuals for deportation is gone into most carefully by His Excellences Executive Council assisted by the Law Officers of the Crown. Information -has always been scanty, but -it was not - until the new scheme was put into operation that the extraordinary lack of information in the hands, of the police became really apparent to me, and I felt that if more was required, I should have to expand my Military Intelligence Organization. My snail Intelligence Staff hadReinforcements may or may not be required, but, whether they are or not, the Secretary of State&apos;s announcement a few days ago that they were available if required, and the unfailing support which is given in Parliament and elsewhere to His Majesty&apos;s Forces in Ireland in their very difficult task, will, in my opinion, have a very marked effectively have, &amp;c, F. Shaw, Lieut.-General,Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.
143collected a quantity of most useful information regarding the organization of the Irish Volunteers, but it was quite inadequate to furnish names or addresses or to identify individuals. For this I looked to the police forces in Ireland, but found that  especially in Dublin the amount of information at their disposal was hopelessly insufficient to cope with the situation. This was due, in my opinion, to the fact that until quite recently the police authorities in Ireland had strenuously opposed any proposal to organize an up-to-date and efficient intelligence system.Since that date measures have been taken within the force under my command to establish a more comprehensive system of intelligence, and I am in a position to-day to say that we are now in this respect in a far stronger position than we were 2 months ago.The first real result of the policy adopted has been the capture of most valuable documents from which the organization of the Irish Volunteer Army has been deduced,The new policy has now been in force for nearly 2 months, and it is only now pi *impossible to begin to judge results. It must be remembered that action taken has been local, that it has been punitive and that the initiative has been in the hands of &quot; the enemy &quot; (as the Irish Volunteer Organization must now be considered), for it is only when an outrage has been committed that the local Volunteer Organization has been punished. It must also be remembered that many of the men wanted are &quot; on the run,&quot; and that it is difficult, if not impossible, in a country district to concentrate the troops necessary to raid the houses of half a dozen Irish Volunteer officers living in different villages without attracting attention. I think one or two of their most enterprising battalions have been very hard hit; I hope almost crippled. Some of their brigades and battalions are, however, still untouched.It is early yet to judge results, but there are indications : (a.) That raids on private houses are beginning to discontinue (such are theinstructions issued by Irish Volunteer headquarters). (6.) That attacks on police barracks are less frequent than they were.   This is dueto improvement in measures of defence and to the fine fights put up by theRoyal Irish Constabulary constables, who have beaten off the majority of attacks made on them, (c.) That in a desperate attempt to terrorize the police, the Irish Volunteer leaders have descended to the policy of murder pure and simple, even without the . excuse that the crime was committed to obtain arms.Such is the situation as I see it at present. The Irish Volunteers consider them-selves at war with the British Government and forces. They have a very powerful organization, which can only be crippled through its leaders. By concentrating every effort and all our resources against those leaders, the organization can and will be broken.   No other course is possible.We may not be able to achieve our ends without some loss of life, but any weakness or delay in dealing with men who are known to be the prime movers of rebellion will mean encouragement to them and far greater loss of life in the end.F. Shaw, Lieut-General,Commanding-in- Chief, Ireland.
