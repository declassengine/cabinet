SECRET.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVEliHlMT.IfINCREASE OP HARBOUR DOCK AND PIER CHARGES.CP 1177     Til       Memorandum for the Cabinet by the &apos;        &apos;     Jspjj klbls t e r^oTTr arisporl; *As a result of the award given by lord Shaw5s Committee on the 20th March under the Industrial Courts Act,, increasing the dockers&apos; remuneration to 16/* a day/ a deputation representing the employers and the men re-quested me to secure that provision is made to increase the maximum charges which the owners of undertakings affected are authorized to make to such an extent as will enable the owners to pay the increased wages.Both sides have agreed that the increased wages should be paid from May 10th, but the employers demur to bringing the increased wages Into force until they are assured that they will be in a position to levy increased charges.Dock charges, are, at present, in most oases, other than docks owned by railways., being charged in excess .&apos;of statutory powers under Defence of the Realm Regulation S9B.B, but the use of this Regulation for the further increase is not practicable.    Under the Ministry of Transport Act I have power to take possession of the Dock Undertakings and to Increase the charges;   this&apos; however, requires the consent of the owners, which they are unwilling to give, and I do not feel justified In using the present emergenoy to press them for their consent.In view of the extreme importance of enabling-the Dock and Harbour Undertakings to increase their charges
by, or as soon as possible after Kay 10th, I recommend that I should have authority to introduce a Bill (n. draft of which is attached) giving mo power to make Orders authorising increases in the statutory maximum&apos;&apos;charge s; Of Port, Harbour, Dock and Pier Undertakings *.-. &apos;The Bill follows the precedent of the Tramways (Temporary-Increase of Charges) Bill, which.has-passed Committee without any serious amendment, and proposes that the increased charges shall not be more than is sufficient to allow an Undertaking to bo   carried onp if the Undertakers are: a Public Body, without loss, and if the Undertakers are private owners, to provide for interest on loan capital and a reasonable return on share capital.The Bill further provides, that, before an   -Order is made reference should be made to the Rates Advisory Committee constituted under the Ministry of Transport Act for their consideration and advice upon the proposal, end that this Committee may appoint with my approval Sub-Committees for the purpose of-these-enquiries consisting of its own members and other members drawn from the Panel appointed un$er the ItLnistry-- of -Transport Actw-. :       It will be competent however for an. Interim Order .(valid for net more than six&quot;months) to be made before the, receipt of the report, from the Rates Advisory. committee     The Act will cease to have&apos; effect after the -15th February 1923 - the date when the period governing the increased-Railway Hates directed to be charged under the Ministry of Transport Act expires *
