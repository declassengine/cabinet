It has now been decided that ALGIERA will transfer her ammunition to OLGA and be freed.The latter ship will be detained pending decision as to disposal of her cargo.Senior- Naval Officer, Baltic reports that bi-weekly steamers between Helsingfors, Reval and Riga are now running and carrying passengers.Information was received from Raefsoe on 13th April to the effect that navigation in Gulf of Bothnia was reopened.Trade.Delegates at Copenhagen continue their deliberations with Litvinov preparatory to their visit to England.Repatriation of British Nationals.The last batch of nationals have crossed the Finnish frontier *    ,Sub-Lieutenant Giddy, R*N.? is reported to be amongst them.     This news relieves the anxiety as to his fate; the Soviet have retained him as a special hostage.      Tho Bolshevik in a long apologia to H.M. Government for the delay in sending last batch, state that they are continuing enquiries as to the confirmed news of the brutal murder after torture of British Officers; Captain Freshville and Lieutenant Smith at Rostov.FinlandoPeace negotiations with Soviet Government continue * The Bolsheviks have accepted Finnish selection of Rajajoki as place to discuss armistice terms.     The subsequent peace negotiations are expected to take -piece at Danzig, probably Poland being also represented.   The Russian Naval Delegate will bd Admiral Behrens, formerly Naval Attache at Rome in the old regime *The Bolshevik terms are more or less conciliatory, but they firmly insist on tho Finns denying to all foreign countries the use of their harbours as Naval Bases to forces operating against \ -.   Bolsheviks.     Proposals are also put forward for the creation of a large neutral passage three nautical miles from the mouth of the Gulf of Finland to a point on meridian crossing Eastern end of Island of Bjorko.   Eastwards from this point to the frontier on the coast a line of demarcation is to be drawn, which, neither party is allowed to exceed.   The sea-lane may be used by all traders, including Russians, carrying cargo.  to/..
90to or from Russia; ships are not to be allowed north of this passage except through stress of weather.    A maritime region on lusbian coast in zone of Islands of Lavansari and Saskari, Cape Loga and. Kaporia Bay may be navigated only by vessels of the Russian Republic.      The conditions of armistice respecting land and sea also apply to aircraft of both parties.The Soviets emphasise their desire for peacef but add that the political activities of anti-Soviet parties in Finland, which have formed armed bands, must cease.Finnish Navy.jjL      ,.11,11 .111        I     -M-) ,&apos;H-Jl..There is reported to be great friction between the former Officers of the Russian Navy and Officers of the Finnish Mercantile Service.      The latter are pro-German to a man, the former, though better trained and more competent, do not enjoy muoh c onf ide no e *Esthonia*No material change In the situation.   Arrangements are being made for a contract for 114 locomctiv.es, presumably from U.S.A. to be delivered in Esthonia for ultimate disposal to Soviet Government *Latvia *An exchange of Motes with Esthonia reiterates the Latvian policy as being friendly to Esthonia. but expresses the hope that the frontier questions will be sfettled satisfactorily. It is also stated that at the Warsaw Conference Latvia reached an agree-ment with Poland on peace negotiaticns with Russia. Lettish peace Delegation to Russia is due to arrive at Moscow at the end of this month.Lithuania.Peace negotiations with Soviet Government are to commence at Reval.on 27th April.   The Soviets state, however, that the Lithuanian claim, to Vilna and Grodno must be considered separately, torn which the Lithuanians reply that definite recognition of the towns as Lithuanian is essential, to any peace negotiations. Soviet Government, however, recognise independence of Lithuania.norjfajy.Negotiations as to co-operation of Norway in the relief of the Bolshevik ice-breaker in the Kara Sea ore in progress.Delegates for the International Congress of Transport-are on the way to Christiania.   Robert williams, described as the &quot;English Bolshevik&quot;, is expected to be the leading figure at the Congress.North Russia.The Soviet Government have reiterated their appeal to H.M. Government to .send a relief expedition to rescue the Russian ice-breaker S0L0VEI BUDIMIROVITCH, ice-bound in the Kara Sea. On the grounds of humanity it has been decided to recondition the ice-breaker SVIATOGOR, now at &quot;Rosyth, and despatch her to Vardo, in a few days, with stores and medicaments for the castaways. The ex-Russian ice-breaker KOSMA MINIM, now at Liverpool, will follow as supporting ship as soon as necessary repairs to hull are made good.   In view, however, of the arctic nature of the expedition, the only route open being north about Nova Zembla, the Admiralty state that as no ice experts are immediately available, it isproposed/in  ti  n
i IS wAfter/proposed to turn the relief vessel over to the Soviet Government1 at Vardo.    A collier will, in addition, he sent to this port, and will either disembark cargo or remain there to renew coal supplies to the expedition.   The Norwegian Arctic explorer, Captain Otto Sverdrup (formerly Hansen s first Lieutenant), has offered his services and will in all probability be in command of the expedition.    The British crews of ice-breakers will return by sea and rail to United Kingdom from Vardo when vessels have been turned over.-Red Army and Navy.It is confirmed by various sources that the morale of these services is very good and the discipline strict, but the general spirit of the sailors and troops, especially those that are workmen, is very hostile to the Soviet Government.MEDITERRANEAN AND BL^CK SEA.Flume.The declaration of the independence of Fiume and Its constitution as a sovereign state by the legionaries1 has created very little enthusiasm or interest in Rome.-On 19th March D&apos;Annunzio, probably pressed by necessity, sent a squadron of motor boats out and seized the s.s. *Vragnizza&apos;, bound from Trieste to Spalato.   She carried a considerable quantity of coffee and other provisions, which were unloaded from her when she was taken into Fiume.   Eventually, the ship   was released and proceeded back to Trieste, where she arrived on the 28th March.An Italian Foreign Office Representative, in conversa-tion recently, stated that America was purposely holding up the Adriatic question so as to develop their project of a huge protected roadstead and harbour in the QUARNERO, with Fiume as its key.   He had actually seen projects of this as proposed by the U.S. Naval Commission, in the Adriatic.The latest development in the Fiume situation is in-dicated by the Italian Prime Minister1s speech in the Chamber on 29th March, which laid down three alternatives settlements:a. Direct agreement between Italy and Jugo-Slavia.b. Application of the Treaty of London.   Under this treaty Volosca, Dalmatia and Flume pass to Jugo-Slavia&apos;and Italy must realise that its application involves the renunciation of Fiume.c. A Modified form of the joint Franco-British-American proposals of Dec 1919, based on a scheme of a buffer state of Fiume.   This does not at all suit Italy, and Jugo-Slavia even less, but would safeguard Italy&apos;s economic interests,Signor Nitti favours (a) and believes Italy is prepared to make grievous sacrifices to arrive at the very necessary settlement.   It is unfortunate, therefore, that M. Pachitch, the head of the Jugo-Slav Peace Delegation, is ill with pleurisy and unable probably to go to San Remo, as his attitude regarding this question is conciliatory.Crimea.General Wrangel, C-in-C, has stated, through British political representative, that he places himself unreservedly in the hands of H .M. Government with regard to negotiations with the Bolsheviks for the capitulation of his Volunteer Forces in the Crimea.   H.M. Government has communicated with Soviet Government and offered to mediate between their forces and General Wrangel.
The Reds are advancing down the coast In the Sochi and Tuapse region.     Trebukis, under General Shkuro, consisting of about 20,000 Kuban and 10,000 Don Cossacks, are retiring to River Shakhe,.   The position of Whites is critical as there is no food&apos; and hostile Georgia is in their rear.   H.M. Ships STEADFAST and CARAD0C are endeavouring to stop Rod advance by gunfire.   The Green Army is operating in this Area, and Is reported to be coming to terms with. Bolsheviks,.thus precipitating the threat to Trans-Caucasian Republics and our line of communication to Persia via Bat cum - Baku Railway.Azerbaijan .Hostilities on.a large scale between Azerbaijan and Armenia have commenced.   If this continues, resistance to Bolshe-vik advance will be lessened and road open to Trans-Caucasia for their advance.Georgia.  .No material change.   Allies&apos; promised aid in material has not yet matured, with consequent political effect&apos; on situation, and which may decide Georgia   to throw in her lot with Bolsheviks. Anti-British feeling is becoming more apparent, but the-inhabitants are prepared to fight the Bolsheviks. Allied re-inforcements for the British garrison,at Batoum have not yet arrived.   As &quot;a matter of policy it is not proposed to eject the Georgians who have invaded Batoum Province.   H.M. Commissioner, Mr. Wardrop, is report ed by C-in-C to be in&apos;indifferent health and anxious to be relievedThe Georgian Government has now released the four Russian Volunteer ships at Poti.Batoum/After considerable delay, an evasive reply was received from M. Chicherin, in which it Is clear that the Soviet&apos;s intention is to make capital out of the offer by introducing irrelevant subjects; such as recognition of Li. Litvinov as a delegate to United Kingdom, and Central European political questions..   Lord Cur z on has presented a strongly worded note in reply, in which he states that if no definite c.p.].y is received in which It is clearly stated that tho safety of the remnants of the Volunteer Army will be respected, H .M. Government will use K .M. Ships as necessary to ensure General Wrangells hold of the Crimea.   The C-ih-C, Mediterranean has been informed of this action.Meanwhile the situation in the Crimea remains critical. If the Volunteer Army remains loyal and fights, the Crimea can be held, but if Bolshevism breaks out in rear of the fighting line, the.Crimea must fail.   Latest news is that the Beds have been repulsed in Perekop area.   The Whites assumed the offensive and landed troops In Karkanit Bay and North of Genichesk combined with advance on Perekop Peninsula.   All operations were successful and much ground regained, prisoners and guns being&apos; captured.   The Reds have, however, mounted guns to command the Kertch Peninsula and are concentrating for a further offensive.   Strong Forces of cavalry are reported in the Sivasft Area.   The Ice in Sivash is, however, now reported to bo thawing. Local risings against Bolshe-boisheviks are reported In Kiev and Odessa districts.British kiss ion with JDenikin.Have been reduced to a minimum and have been transferred to Crimea.   Captain V* Phillimore, R.N. is at Theodosia in command of Naval Units.   &quot;Kuban *- 4 -

STANDFAST and ARK ROYAL at Soc$i to ascertain the situation.   He will then proceed- to Batoum.Cas plan Fleet.Petrovsk has been evacuated and the Volunteer Fleet with the exception of two ships &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;Chesovoi&quot; has arrived at Enzeli.The Commander of one of the chips reports that though the Volga is still ice-bound, Astrakhan is now clear of ice.   He was attacked by four Red ships outside Astrakhan and again off Petrovsk.Commander Luke telegraphing from Baku on 13th April reports that all fifteen ships of the Volunteer Fleet are satisfactorily interned at Enzeli.The C-in-C, East Indies, has been ordered to send an officer to liinzeli as soon as possible to supervise their intern-ment and, if necessary, their destruction.C-in-C, Mediterranean has been asked for information with regard to the disposal of 12 C.M.B!s given by Great Britain to this Fleet.   It is important that these units should not fall into bolshevik hands, as their reappearance in the Baltic via River Volga In a few weeks is most probable.   G.O.C. Persian Force requests C-in-C, Mediterranean that one or more Naval Officers be sent to help in the supervision of Fleet and for mining operations. C-in-C, kediterranean proposes to send a party of 5 Officers and 30 men.   Leaving Constantinople 19th April for Batoum they will proceed to iinzeli via Baku for this service.TURKEY.On April 7th Damad Ferid visited the British High Commissioner to discuss the question of combating the Nationalist Movement.   He informed Admiral cle Robeck that the Government were supporting Anzavur in the area south of the Sea of Marmora and had  -legalised his position by appointing him Governor of Balikesser. (Anzavur has recently been carrying on hostilities against Turkish Nationalists in the neighbourhood of Bigha, and has captured fchs several places),   The   germ of a similar movement existed, he said, between the gulfs of Guenlek and Isrrild, and he asked how far the Allies would go   in supporting the Government to organise and utilise these movements.   Admir 1 de Robeck held out no hope of active British co-operation against the Nationalists forces in Asia Minor, but proposes that the British Government should alloif military material to be used for equipping the Anti-Nationalist force so     He also proposes that permission should be granted to the Turkish Government for the movement of any regular forces of undoubted loyalty, and that the principle should be observed that the new Government is entitled to full Allied support short of armed co-operation in reasonable efforts to suppress the National-is ts who continue to defy its authority.   General Milne is pre-pared to act on these principles, provided the High Commissioner, gives him the necessary authority.     This Admiral tie Robeck has done.     As regards the other High Commissioners, the High Commissioner proposes to keep them generally informed of such movements, but to act so far as Constantinople and Anatolia are concerned on the assumption that the carrying out of the above programme rests primarily with us In the same way that it rests with the French in Northern Cilicia.Italy/
