The officers concerned would in this event pay the cost of operating and maintaining the cars, and consequently have every inducement to run the cars,efficiently and economically,I am proposing to discuss an arrangement on these lines with the Departments concerned^
1tym -     .Cars used &quot;by Fighting Services Departments.The question of the control&quot; of the oars used for official purposes by the Fighting Services Departments was also discussed by War Cabinet &apos;635 but :no conclusion wag-come -to, the War Cabinet reserving their decision in the.case of the Fighting Services until the Secretary of State for War had furnished a&apos;memorandum-, on the subject and the First Lord  . of the Admiralty could be present.A memorandum was submitted by the Secretary;of State for War on December 9th, C.P.274, but I am not aware of any decision of the Cabinet.on the subject.    A final decision on this point is necessary so that.I may be in a position to make -arrangements,.for the proper supervision of all the cars for&apos; which the Cabinet desire to hold me responsible.
