Note from President Wilson dated 26th March, 1920.II. Reply drafted by Lord Curzon and. approved by the Supreme Council, on 26th April, 1920.(Circulated for information).A.J.136, I,PARAPHRASE of Dispatch from the British Representative at Washington, dated  6th March, 1920, to the Foreign Office, London.The Secretary of State!s note is as follows:-In acknowledging receipt of Your Excellency&apos;s communication of the 12th March in respect of Conferences relating to the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and the present position of negotiations proceeding between the chief Allied Powers, I am to inform you that in the view of the president it does not seem desirable that a Plenipotentiary should represent the United States at the Conferences.    As, however, this Govern-ment is profoundly interested in the future peace of the world,the President thinks that its views on the suggested solutions of the intricate problems connected with the Turkish treaty should be frankly expressed.     The United States it is truewere not at war with Turkey,&apos; but its armies and navies were fighting the principal Allies-of that country and. in contribution-ing to the defeat of those Allies, they also contributed to ytlje defeat of the Turks.     Accordingly the President holds that it is the duty of his Government to communicate its views and to press for a solution which will be at once lastingand/
and just.     The Washington Government understands the . cogenojj 2 4 of.the arguments for the retention/)! the Turks at Constantino-pie, but is of .opinion that the arguments against it are far stronger and contain certain elements which, in thoir opinion, oan soari&amp;ely be ignored. .   The Allies have often expressed their Intention that the anomaly of the Turks in Btfope shouldend., and it is. difficult to believe that the Mohammedan peoples who not only witnessed, without protest, the defeat0$ Turkish power, but even contributed materially to that defeat, willow feel so strongly on the subject as to resent tho expulsion of the Turkish Government, necessitating on the part of the Great Powers a complete reversal of policy which seems neither necessary nor desirable.It is assumed that the line given as the Southernfrontier of Turkey is meant to be the ethnological frontier of the Arabs.     If this is the caso, certain rectifications would appear to be necessary.     Supposing, however, that .,ln choosing this line the Allied. Powers were guided by other considerations, the Washington Government, without any desire to oritioise, would be glad to fee supplied with thearguments which led the Powers to make this choice.    The Washington Government are glad. to-, note that on the International Council which it is proposed..should beestablished for the Government of Constantinople and theStraits, provision is made for Bus si an representation.They.are convinced that no arrangement which is new madein respeo-t of.the Government and the control of   constantinople and the Straits can possess any element of permanency unless Russiars vital interests in those problems are protected and. carefully provided for, and unless,-when Russia once more has a Government which is recognised by the civilised world, it is understood that that Government may assert its-just claim to be heard in respect of whatever decisions may-now be readhed.     The United Spates Government are convinced that no final decision should, or can, be made in respect of the passage of men-of-war and the regime of the Straits-.in War time without the consent of Russia. They accordingly note with pleasure that these questions are under consideration.
As regards Thrace, it appears to the Got eminent ofthe United States only right that that portion of Eastern Thrace, which is outside the zone reserved for Constantinople, should, with the oreontion of the Northern part of that provincev become part of tho Kingdom of Greece.     This northern part is clearly Bulgarian in population;    justice and fair dealing consequently demand that tho cities of Kirk-Killisse and Adrianople and the surrounding territory should be part of Bulgaria.     Both on ethnic and historicalgrounds Bulgaria&apos;s claim is worthy of the most serious consideration;   moreover, it- would appear that Bulgaria is entitled to have its claim to this territory favourably considered, having regard to the fact that it has been com-pelled to give up territory whioh is purely Bulgarian as well as many thousands of Bulgarians on its Western boundary, on the rather doubtful grounds of securing for Serbia a strategical frontier.In respect of the proposed preferential right of three great Mediterranean powers to furnish instructors and advisers in certain zones, the Washington Government feel that before they can express an intelligent opinion on thisquestion, they must be furnished with more information as to the reason and purpose of such a plan.     The genuine interest of the Government of the United States in the plan for Armenia cannot/ be questioned, and the Government are convinced that most liberal treatment for that unfortunatecountry is both expected and ciemanded by the civilised:world.     Armenia!s boundaries therefore should be fixed insuch a way as to recognise all the legitimate claims of the Armenians, and to secure for them unencumbered and easyaccess to the sea.     The United States Government are not aware of the considerations whioh governed the decisionarrived1 at by the Supreme Council, but   they feel that the-  3 - access/
aooess to the sea, whioh is indispensable to Armenian interests, would hardly be assured by granting special rights over Lazistan.Taking into considernation thsfc TreHzond has always been the termination of the trade toute across Armenia and that M.Venizelas, speaking on behalf of the Turks of that district, has expressed their preference fur connection with Armenia rather than Turkey, it is hoped that the Powers will agree to grant Trebizond to Armenia.In respect of the question of Turkey relinquishingher rights to Arabia, Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia andthe Islands, the Washington Government suggest that thesame method adopted in the case of Austria should now beresorted to, that is to say, that these provinces shouldbe placed by Turkey in the hands of the Great Powers,for those Powers to dispose of as they may think right.The Washington Government have too limited informationas to the exact arrangement that is contemplated for Smyrna, and the reasons for deciding upon this arrangement,to be in a position to express an opinion at present on this most important question.The Washington Government fully appreciate the many difficulties that come up for settlement in connection with the Treaty with Turkey.     Owing to the conflicting interests involved the problems are complex and fruitful of misunderstandings, but the United States Government are confident that in handling these problems the Powers will be animated by a spirit of fairness and of ascrupulous regard for the interests of the vanquished,victor and neutral alike.Before a comprehensive plan can be worked out itis obvious that much remains to be done, and this Government will be glad to receive further information in/
in regard to the economic clauses of the Turkish Treaty.The plan that has apparently been elaborated by the Supreme Council in connection with the continuation of concessions granted to aliens, and also giving the rightto cancel or to revise concessions on payment of indemnity(vide 8th paragraph of Your Excellency&apos;s Note) has, incidentally, grave possibilities, and careful elucidation would seem to be necessary.In conclusion, let me say that, whatever arrangements or territorial changes may be made in the farmer Ottoman Empire, the Washington Government understand that such arrangements or ohanges will   in no .way place the citizens or corporations of the United. States of America or ofany other country in a position less favourable than corporations or citizens of any Power which is a partyto the Turkish Treaty.Whitehall Gardens. S.W.I. 29th March, 1920.. .

ANSWER TO AMERICAN NOTE ON THE TREATY 0F PEACE WITH TURKEY.

(Approved by the Supreme Council at San Rome on 26th April, 1920, - I.C.P.-109(2)).

The allied Governments value the frank expression of the views of the United States Government. They have, however, necessarily deferred a reply to the note of the secretary of the State Department until the terms of the Treaty have been sufficiently formulated to be submitted to the supreme Council now assembled at San Rome.

The Council notes that the United States Government do not propose to be represented by a planipotertiary? at the Conference charged with no ?tiating the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, other-?ise than in the ?city of an observer, from which it follows that the United abates Government do not intend to become signatories to the Treaty.

The Council welcomes, however, the assurance borne out by the presence of the United States Ambassador at Rome that the United states maintain their close interest in the terms of the settlement, end is happy to take this occasion to afford the United states Government further information and explanations concerning the terms agreed upon before ?. Johnson&apos;s arrival. The Allied Governments do not inter? ?r. Colby&apos;s desire ?or such information to mean that the negotiation with Turkey should be delayed until each of the particular points raised in his note has been exhaustively discussed with the United states Government, and on agreement with the arrived at. This would, indeed, in existing circumstances have rendered all fruitful ?tions impossible.

The Allied Governments have never cancelled their ?ish to see the United states associated in the ?tion and ? the Treaty which is to embody the re-settlement of Turkey on a just and la?tin basis. In the hope and expectation of American participation they had delayed the ?tions with ?
sameTurkey t tho risk of ^rve/ly Imperilling the pru-spect ox any oat is factory settlement being effected vita out a fresh recourse to arms.     Thoy. fully understand and apureoiate the reasons tor -which the United abates Government have not, finally, seen their way to bo oo me oar ties to the Treaty.     The burden of the negotiation -which has not be on lightened by the Ion?: dolay which has unhappily, but in the circumstances unavoidably, intervened - has therefore fallen on tho -Hies alone.   They have readily accepted it, and have endeavoured to discharge an increasingly difficult duty to the best of their ability and judgment.   They feel con-fid en t that the settlement which they are about to propose to the Turkish Government will be found in harmony with the - or I no ivies and&apos; id eals&apos;which have -inspired them, in common %ith the United Atotes, in vadng war and in. concluding peace with Turkey&apos;s late allies.    The desire of the United States Government that the Treaty shall be fair and Just to all parties is entirely shared by the Allied Governments.   When, hoaever, it is ur^ea that the settlement shall be mode/with scrupulous regard for the interests of victor, vanquished and neutral1, it oeust be , remembered that there cannot in justice be equality of consideration-tion on tho one hand for the interests of the Turks who wantonly joined Germanyand.Austria-Hungary in their war of aggression, and on the other  hand for the interests of the former subject races of ?ur; ey whom the Allies, at immense sacrifices of life and treasure, have delivered from Turkish misrule.The Allied Governments now pass to the consideration of the specific points raised in   It. oolby&apos;s note.   (1) with revard to Constantinople the advantages and disfadventages of excluding the Sultan&apos;s ;government :ient from any territory in Europe, have been very carefully &apos; oi-hed.     An ewhoustive examination of the problem in all its boorinas hod convinced the -lllied Governments that, suau^irr: ouch a policy to be in itself desirable, its ado.&quot;tion&apos; would entail upon tbe;n responsibilities, dangers and sacrifices which, with, due record to their e n national interests and obligations, they ore not in a position sorely to incur-   -&apos;,t the
same time the Allied Governments recognise that the problem might have presented itself in a different light if those responsibilities dangers and sacrifices were not to be borne by themselves alone but shared by the United States of America.

(2) The southern frontier of Turkey has been ? after due consideration not only on the ethnical but also of the economic and geographical factors involved. The United States Government will readily recognise that as in the case of other Treaties with Enemy Powers, it is impossible to isolate these factors. In the region of Cilicia the problem is more than usually complicated by the intermingling of those racial elements, whose interests it is the object of the allied Government to protect.

(3) The Allies not with pleasure that the United States Government welcome the provision made in the Treaty for the representation of Russia on the straits Commission. The United States Government would, however, appear to be under a misapprehension in supposing that the scope of the Commission is to be extended to the administration of Constantinople itself.

(4) The question of the straits has formed the subject of prolonged and careful consideration with a view to ? free on of ? it is hoped and believed that the United States Government will be in full accord with the provisions agreed upon. It has obviously been impossible to defer the drafting of so vital chapter on the Turkish Treaty pending the eventual consultation with Russia.

(5) The decision of the Allied Governments to incorporate Eastern Thrice, outside the zone of Constantinople, in the Kingdom of Greece appears generally to conform with the views of the United States Government. The statistical date in the Possession of the Allied Government do not, however, support? Colby&apos;s contention regarding the Bulgarian character of the cities of Adrainople and Kirk Killsseh and of the surrounding territory. On the contrary all sources, agree in estimating the Bulgarian populatin as marked

It is, therefore, the intention of &quot;the Governments of France, Groat Britain and Italy/to conclude a self-denying ordinance which shall avoid any semblance of rivalry or competition among themselves and which shall conduce to the more effective protection of the minorities still remain-ing within tho Turkish Empire.     It is needless to observe that such an ordinance only binds its -signatories, and that there is nothing therein to impede the free entry for commercial and economic purposes of the nationals of other states into any part of the area mentioned   in the Allied Agreement.(7) The Allies share to tho full, America&apos;s interest in the establishment of an independent Armenia,    It has been Their earnest desire to accord to Armenia the territory which she might reasonably claim for her present needs and future expansion. The problem has proved to be the most difficult cf the whole treaty and the obstacles with which the Allies have found them-selves confronted have at times seemed almost, insuferablo.   The matter Is being fully and frankly dealt with in a separate communication to the United States Government.(5)*2he Allied Governments are in accord with the United States Government in holding, that Turkey should relinquish by the Treaty her forrnor rights over.Mesopotamia, Arabia, Palestine, Syria and the Islands.     The precision with which the arrangements for the future status of these territories can be formulated in the Turkish Treaty has of necessity been, governed by the necessity of expediting the conclusion of the Treaty with Turkey    a conclusion
conclusion which  as already pointed out- .1as boon deferred to the limits cf. expediency.(9) The settlement of the.district of Smyrna has proved one of the most difficult problems with which the Allied Governments wore   faced.     The most impartial statistics at their disposal shew that at a date prior to tho forcible expulsion ef the subject population from this area, a majority of Greeks existed In tho Sanjak of Smyrna and in some of the neighbouring cazas. Past experience of the Turkish treatment of this Greek population wh? have preserved in a marked degroo and in spite of oppression their national characteristics, havo led the Allies to grant their strong   claim to be placed under Greek administration.   On the other hand the interior of this region, in which the Turkish population gradually increases until it markedly predominates over the Greek, is connected economically with Smyrna.   Indeed Smyrna forms the present natural outlet for. the trade of a large part of Western Anatolia.     Moreover the Allied Governments have beon advised that the immediate and complete, cession of an area, so closely linked with the economy of Anatolia and for so long a time an integral part of tho Asiatic provinces of Turkey would, in practice, have aroused national feeling to a degree which might have rendered the rest of tho contemplated settlement of Turkey difficult, if not impossible.Tho Allies have fully weighed their conflicting considera-tions and have agreed upon a settlement which, while placing a carefully defined area securely under Greek administration, safeguards Turkish access to the port of Smyrna and preserves Turkish suzerainty over the Whole region during a period fully sufficient for the true wishes of the population to find expression.(10) The economic provisions of the Turkish Treaty are in general harmony with those approved in the Treaties with the other enemy powers.     With particular regard to concessions in the former Turkish Empire these were, as is well known, not infrequently obtained by dubious means, and in conditions
consistent with the best development of the areas where they wore located.     The -event ua.1 right to cancel-concessions has only been provided for in territories which are to be placed under   tho tutelage of the Principal Allied Prwers.   It has been felt unfair necessarily to saddle these new states with burdens which they had no vc ice in incurring.   All that is sought In the present Treaty is the right inherent in every sovereign state to c ancel or resume concessions incompatible with the interests of the state;   but in any such eventuality the fullest provision is made for the indemnification, if necessary by way of arbitration, of the concessionaire.   With regard to the general financial provisions- of the Treaty, the aim of the Treaty is to protect Turkey from the exploitation to which she is exposed by her financial necessities, and to establish a sound system of finance which will enable her to meet her obligations and to reap herself the advantage,of her economic possibilities.(11) Pinally the Allied Governments take this opportunity of assuring the United States Government that the Allied Govorn-ments have in no way sought by the territorial changes and arrangements&quot; provided for in the Turkish Treaty to paaoe corporations or citisens in a privileged position as compared with American citizens or corporations,   They feel, however, that they would be lacking in candour if they did not point out that as they, are precluded from undertaking obligations on behalf of non-signatory powers, so. also they are unable to stipulate conditions in their favour. -San Remo.26th April, 1920.
