SITUATION IN SOUTH RUSSIA.Uj colleagues may like to see the appended extracts from a private letter dated 1st April, 1920 from Admiral    de Robeck.(Intlld) W.H.L. 22. 4. 20,
The Rear-Admiral (M. Culme Seymour) appears to have done very well during the evacuation of Denikin&apos;s Army at Novorossisk, and it is due to the British Navy that so many were got away - as far as it is possible to find out about 35,000 actual soldiers were taken to the Crimea, and perhaps another 8,000 will be collected along the Coast of the Black Sea province and some at Poti who are retreating from the Caspian side.   If the Russians now secure themselves in the Crimea and reorganise their forces, they will at least be in a po;:: it ion to make the Bolsheviks come to terms.   I hope so, as one wants to make them use it as an asylum for the refugees Fisher has do: o wonderfully well in settling these unfortun-ato people, in spite of        opposition in every direction. In fact as soon as Lemnos is a going concern we should have them all placed, of course unless the Crimea goes when I confess that I do not see what more can be done.   If the fight against the Bolsheviks is to be continued by the Russians, it should be done under a new and popular leader (possibly &apos;i;rangel, who I am expecting here to see me at any moment) Denikin has been done down by his entourage and is no longer suitable.   In fact, the future must be organised on quite&quot; different lines from the past effort, which should, and would have succeeded had Denikin1s advisors been even honest and capable.   Apart from,the difficult situation here due to no policy; the constant intrigues of our Allies are truly pain-ful, and for the moment the French are the worstj they do not seem to care so much about their own affairs and interests, as long as hey can down us.   All their efforts in Turkey, Russia or   Caucasus are in that direction. It will truly only an interesting thing Is going on which will show the confidence the Germans have in their future in Russia. Recently when &quot;Hussar11 was going to Taranto for Webb I sent a Russian Princess to Koine to her sister there (she was without means, but owner of large estates in Russia) she writes now to another Russian lady here (Constantinople) that she is going to Berlin, as she has had an offer from Germans to buy her estate at a good, price, and advising her friend here in Constantinople to do the same.   That shows how confident the Germans are that they will control Russia in the near future and the clever Run is gambling in &quot;real estate&quot;.The Admiralty have got a very strong case for a strong Navy after events out here, if it were -not for our fleeT in these waters we would indeed be impotent.     Once we start on war in Anatolia it will spread into a very big fire, and to my mind the Turkish Nationalists are sure to turn to the Russian Bolsheviks for assistance and there is no reason now that Denikin Is finished they should not receive it. A grave danger to us.X .  X X X X
