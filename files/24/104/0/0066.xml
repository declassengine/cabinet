&apos;    3 0 9LEAGUE OjB1 NATIONS.Governing Commission of the Translation. Saar Territory,&apos;Saarbruck,25th March, 1920.FIRST RjSPOBT OF TH3 SAAR Molh GOVJSKMIMGCOMMISSION.The Governing&quot; Commission of the Territory of the Saar Basin, constituced. by a decision of the Council of the League of nations on 13th February, arrived at Saarbruok on  1st February.     Even before its official entry into the city it held several meetings in Council, at which it examined and decided some important questions.preliminary Questions.Four members only of the Commission were present:-MM. Victor Rault, State Councillor (France), President;   de Booh (Saar);   Lambert (Belgium);   and Count von Moltke-Huitfeldt (Denmark).     The Commission did not know who was to be the fifth member or when he would arrive.     It was of the unaiimogs .* opinion that there were serious objections to postponing ir,s installation owing to the absence of one of the Commissioners. In a letter from the President of the Peace Conference to -line President of the Gorman Delegation, dated 5th January, 1920, the Allied and Associated Powers had, in fact, undertaken &quot;to reduce to a minimum the period of transition between the cominginto force of the peace Treaty and the installation of the Governing Commission&quot;&apos;, a period daring which it had been agreedthat the military authority in occupation should continue to exercise, sonxrol ov^r the government and the administration/)! the Saar.     The welfare of tfre population of the Territory re-quired that military occupation should be replaced at once by a permanent regime.     Moreover, it is stated in para.V tf the Directions drawn up by the Council of the League of Nations that &quot;the Commission will settle whether, and, eventually, to what extent, Its deoisions are valid if taken in the absence of one or more members&quot;.At its first meeting, on 21st February, the Commission decided, to enter officially on its duties without waiting for the arrival of the fifth memoer.     But it resolved to take only the most urgent decisions  and it announced its intention to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations in a telegram dated 21st February.Distribution of Duties among the Members of the Commission.The Governing- Commission^roceeded first to a provisional distribution of its duties among its different memDers, as it had the right to do under its Directions (para.IV).   The presidenytotik charge of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, Commerce, Industry and Labour;   Mr.von Boon, of Finance;   Mr.Lambert, of Public Works, Railways and the Postal and Telegraph Service; and Mr.von Moltke-Huitfeldt, of public Education,&quot;Ecclesiastical matters, Charities, Health and Social Insurance.     The Depart-ments of Justioe, Agriculture and Supply were reserved for the fifth/
fifth member of the Commission, subject to his acceptance. In the Interim the President will take charge of these departments.Choioe of the Seat of Government^In order to instal the services of the new government, it was necessary at once to select the seat of the Commission. The Secretary-General cf the league of nations had notified the Commission of a petition presented by the inhabitants of Saarlouis, claiming for their city the honour of being des-ignated as the seat.     The day after its arrival, the Commissiom,went.to Saa^] ouis to hear theJv^yor1 s declaration, and to consider the advantages and disabvantages of residence In thatcity.     The Commission was of the unanimous opinion, that, inspiie of the historical claims cf Saarlouis, the capitalcould not bo established eslewhere than at Saarbruok.     In thismatter it attached the greatest importance to the suggestionscontained in para.II of^the Directions of the League of Nations.By an Ordinance of 27th February it decided that its seat should.be established at Saarbruck;   but at the same time, in order tosatisfy as far as possible the desires of the population oxSaarlouis, is announced that the latter city should be the seat of the highest Judicial authorities, and that the civil and Cirminal Court of Appeal should, be established there.     TheCommission decided, moreover? to use the great military estab-lishments created in Saarlouis by the Germans and now standingempty.     These will serve as prisons and. penitentiaries, andwiil house the services for the relief of children and old people, sine0 these services will be better domiciled atSaarlouis,almoe&amp; in the country than at saarbruoJ^ which isa centre, already over-populated.Assumption of Bower and Offlpi&amp;JL Entry into Saarbruck.mHaving taken these preliminary decisions, and having rapidly examined the position, the Commission decided to assume power on 26th February, and on the same day to make its official entry into Saarbruck.     It was received, at the Station by the Mayor and the Military Authorities in occupation, and proceeded to the Hotel du lane rat, where the seat of government will be established.     Delegations of officials and of the organised bodies tf the Territory presented their respects and promised loyal collaboration.In his reply, the President developed, the principles set forth in a proclamation which the Commission the day before had had posted and printed in all the newspapers of the territory.(The Proclamation has been sent to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and a copy is enclosed with the,,present report). The Commission affirmed in this Proclamation that it desired to govern the country in the name of the League of Nations in accord with the priiciples set forth in the Covenant, and to enforce respeot for all the stipulations of the Treaty, of Ver-sailles.     It further stated, that it had no- other concern than the welfare of the population whose fate had been entrusted, to it.It was the more necessary to reassure the Inhabitants of the Territory, as they had long been expecting the arrival of the Commission anfl had great faith in it.
! 311The pcli tic al and Fcono-rlc Situation of t h r S a a r in F eh ru a r y 192 g .tThe- regime of the Saar had remained practically unchanged since the Armistioe.   The coming into force of the Peace Treaty had not aoftoned Vi in any way.   Notwithstanding the ability and tact of GENERAL VIREEL, the Supreme Administrator of the Saar, to whom the President of the Commission made a point of paying a public tribute on 26th February, the military occupa-tion and the dictatorial powers implied by it weighed heavily on the population.   Since 11th November, 1918, tho Saar had been living, under a provisional regime without any legal basis; none of the numerous and serious questions arising since that date had been settled.   The Commission, instead of devoting all its strength and time to organising its government and carrying into effect the Treaty of Versailles, was consequently obliged, immediately after its installation, to deal with urgent and complicated problems, and will continue to be so occupied for some time to come.From the first, ^he economic position of the Saar seemed to the Commission to be critical,   The Mines, which are the great wealth of the Territory, have been given to France for the pur-poses of reparation, the country thus being deprived of its prin-cipal resource.-. Moreover, the Treaty-stipulates that the Saar Basin shall be included in the French customs regime.   The taking over of the mines and the customs by French agents, consequent upon the coming into force of the Treaty^ could not be arranged without disturbing the normal course of business and damaging many interests.   Further, the supplies of the country, hitherto1 assured by Germany, seemed to be mere and more endangered;   The situation was rendered still more difficult by the proximity of the French frontier, which emphasised the difference, at the present rate of exchange, between the franc and the mark.   Goods bought in France (in francs) reach extremely high figures (in marks) when they are sold in the Saar.   Wages must be continually increased.   Persons giving on fixed incomes and those on the retired list are espec-ially affected by the depreciation of the mark.   The crisis will become still more acute if the French State mines, availing them-selves of a right conferred on them by the Treaty, pay their workmen, and effect their purchases and sales, in francs.   The absence of all political life,&apos;the economic difficulties, and the constraint of a prolonged military regime, had undeniably provoked unrest among the inhabitants.   Their discontent had been aggrava-ted and exploited by those who, within the Saar as well as else- -where, have not accepted the Treaty of Versailles and are prepar-ing either to tear it up or to evade its stipulations.   The Commis-sion has proofs that the population has been worked upon by agents whose objects are altogether removed from the interests and wel-fare of the inhabitants of the Saar.   When the Commission entered on its duties, these agents attempted to profit by the occasion to promote disorder in the country; certain of them delivered inflammatory speeches at public meetings.   This agitation coital-ded with the attempt made at Berlin to establish a military die-tatorship; it was inspired by the same ideas and the same hopes and, doubtless, by the same men. v
Attitud&quot; of the aoverging (ummission.&apos; Confronted with this situation, the Governing Commission refused to take any severe measures: no public meeting, was prohibi-ted, no newspaper was suspended, and not a single individual was ex-pelled.   The President simply called the leaders, of the political parties and explained to them the line of conduct that the Govern-ment had chosen, stating that it was resolved to maintain order in the territory.   The Commission, had the satisfaction of noting that its advice was respected.   Contrary to the statements of certain foreign newspapers, there has been no disturbance within the entire Territory of the Saar.   Only one manifestation, on the part of a few hundred&apos; persons and lasting not o/er an hour, took place in the streets of Saarbruck.   It was without Incident, save for.the singing of patriotic songs, and a patrol of 15 men was sufficient to dis* :.-perse it.   The few strikes that have taken place since 26th February all originated in the demands of workmen for higher wages; they wBre of short duration and were settled without the least difficulty.Substitution of civil Administration for Military Admini strati on.The foregoing general remarks on the political&apos; and economic, situation in the Territory of the Saar were necessary in order to explain the difficulties with which the Commission has to deal and the precautions that it mast take in organising a new regime.   Its first concern was to substitute a c!2il administration,for the military administration.   To. this, end it retained the greater number, of the officials appointed by the Imperial, Prussian and Bavarian   -Governments.   As to the choice of new men, it was Very difficult to find immediately among the native inhabitants of the Saar, a country almost exclusively industrial; men sufficiently trained for public office.   The Governing Commission has therefore retained for some weeks a reduced staff of officers of the Supreme Administration of the Saar, which has been entrusted,- under the orders of the Commission; with the duty of &quot;^expediting, outstanding business.   As the services are permanently organised, these officers will be gradually replaced by inhabitants of the Saar, under the direction of a few heads of services from other countries chosen for their professional ability.The military administration proper has already completely disappeared; its representations in the Districts (Kreise) have been relieved of their offices. . The Commission has endeavoured to organise its services in the shortest possible time.   Since its arrival in Saarbimck it has established a Secretariat-General, whose -;.principal -duties will be to prepare the meetings of the Commission,, to draft . the minutes and to kee; the archives, and,&apos; finally,, under the direct-ion of the President, to maintain relations with.the League of Nations, It has organised a Department of Public Safety, without/which it would not have been possible to dispense with the French military.police, and a service for the Inspection of Mines.   Without the latter it would not have been able to guarantee to France the free exploitation of the mines which is conferred on her by the Treaty.Adoption of t, i c eral   ?* ea sur eg.Simultaneously with the substitution of a civil administra-tion for a military administration, the Governing Commission has restored to the country its public liberties.   There would have been serious disadvantages in passing without a gradual transition from a regime of occupation, with all the severity that this implies, to the really democratic regime which the Commission is determined to establish.   A few days after taking over /
authority, the Commission restored complete freedom of move-mont vlthin the Territory, removed tho. oontrol in the railway stations, except on the frontiers, and abolished postal oen-sorship.    It is taking steps to restore complete liberty to the ?ress and the right of publio meeting.    If it has in theory maintained the precautionary measures instituted by the military authorities in those respoots, it has avoided resorting to then.    Military, police courts have been abolished; no inhabitant of the Saar will henceforth bo summoned bolero a court-martial.   An amnesty ordinance has been promulgated; it covers sentences pronounced by the military police courts, and will be followed by other measures of grace in favour of individuals - condemned&apos; by German courts or French courts-martial.Mai ntenance 0 f Troo ps,Entrusted by the   eace Treaty with the duty of maintaining order.in the Territory of the Saarp the Commission was of the opinion that it could not, until the local gendarmerie was organised, dispense with the presence of troops.     It has, therefore, requested that French troops may be retained, thereby availing itself of the right conferred on it by para,3Q of the Annex to Section IV (Pai*t III) of tho Treaty of Versailles, as interpreted in the report submitted by lie Oaolamanos to the Council of the League&apos; of Nations,,     But these troops are no longer troops of occupation, they aro garrison troops.Status of the Officials,,The Governing Commission has been obliged to settle some special problems upon which it will be opportune to give somo information, without going into administrative details.&apos;    It is endeavouring to conform with the Treaty by making the Territory of the Saar an autonomous country independent of Germany,   But&apos; it was necessary to retain an adminl strati on.   By an ordinance&apos;, of which a copy is enclosed,&apos; it has regulated the status of the officials by roappointing to its service the Imperial, Prussian and Bavarian agents holding office in the Saar, provided they are put at its disposal by their respective Governments,,     On the other hand,, it has taken the right, after an experience of a few months, to replace at the disposal of their own Governments those individuals who,-by their ill-will or by their hostility to the new regime, will bo likely to paralyse its action or to compromise its work,-   The ordinance obliges all to take an oath as follows: - &quot;I pledge my fidelity to the Governing Commission, representing tho League of Nations, my obedience to the laws and my conscientious fulfilment of the duties of my office,&quot;    In return, the ordinance assures to the officials., together with the necessary- guarantees for their future, important material advantages.Hnanoial Organisation of the SaaroBy another ordinance, the Commission has undertaken to es-tablish the financial autonomy of the Saar,   .It has.decided to date its first budgetary year from 1st. April, i920, the date on which the Russian fiscal year begins.   The taking over of the receipts and expenditures of the Territory will thus be facili-tated, as the organisation of a central treasury will be available for the collection of taxes from 1st April,   The Governing Comm-ission fully appreciates the difficulties that it will, encounter, in endeavouring to balance a budget.    The burden on such a small country of a central administration,
however limited, the advances necessary for supplies and the deficit from the exploitation of the railways, will weigh very heavily on ita budget.     By an ordinance dated  Oth March, 19SO, the Oommission decided to collect, as from 1st April, 1920, the tax on ooal established by German law.   The rate of this tax will, however, be fixed at 10 per cent.New Organisation of the Railways.On the day of its arrival in the Saar, the Governing Commission was called upon to solve a particularly delicate problem.     Saarbruck was the seat of a Prussian Railway Board, whose authority extended far beyond the limits of the Territory of the Saar;   on the other hand, the lines established in the  ; part of the Bavarian Palatinate attached by the Treaty.to the Saar 3asin were under the Bavarian Board of Railways at Ludwigshaven.During the month of December last, Marshal Pooh, ss President of the Inter-allied Council of T^ar at Versailles, ordered the establishment at Saarbruck of a special Board for the Territory of the Saar (that Is, one which should direct both the Prussian and Bavarian lines In the Saar Basin), and the transfer to some point outside the Territory of the offices directing the Prussian lines situated outside the Saar Basin (but hitherto attached to the Board of Saarbruok).     The German Government and its agents showed themselves in no way disposed to comply with the order issued to them.   After lone negotiations, it was decided that the Conference meeting at Treves on 9th February should&apos;settle the question.   The German delegates came without full creden-tials.   Nevertheless, the Conference fixed 25th February as the date for the establishment of a special Board at Saarbruck for the lines of the Territory of the Saar.   But as the Governing Commission appointed on 13th February was about to assume power, the Marshal decided to tie tot this question to it. After a careful examination of the documents, the Oommissiorv considered it advisable to establish a Board for the Saar Railways, independent of all authority outside the Saar, and to order the transfer, to some city outside the Saar, of the administration of lines lying outside the Saar and depending on the governments of Berlin and Munich.   The Commission decided therefore, by an^ordinance dated 28th February, to fix 10th March as the date for establishing at Saarbruck a special Board for the lines of the Saar.   In spite of the objections of the Prussian President of the Board of Railways, it abided by its decision, which was carried out on the date fixed.     However, at the request of the railway officials, and in order to give them proof of its goodwill, the Commission allowed those who were to leave the Saar to remain there until 1st April, on the understanding that they were to devote their time to the railways outside the Territory of the Saar under the former Board at Saarbruck.   This permission was abused by the President of the Railways, who established at Saarbruck two railway Boards:   Board No. 1 (Saar lines) and Board No. 2 (lines outside the Saar).   This situation was intolerable. In-fsot, close to the office for the Saar railways and in a building belonging to the Government of the Saar, they had, installed a Board for German railways outside the Saar. In spite of the protests of this Board, and after a Conference . with the Unions of Railway Employees, to whom the Commission explained that their interests were not in the least endangered, the decision was maintained, .and it is now understood that it\
will be fully carried out on 1st April.   On this date there will be in the Saar one single Board, managing only the Saar railways.Conclusion.To conclude this report, already too long, the Commission be^s to state to the Council of the League of Natioas, from whom it holds its mandate, that it hopes it has deserved the confidence placed in it.     The principal care of the League of nations is to insure the welfare of the Saar.     The maintenance of public order is the first necessity.   Although we assumed authority under the most difficult circumstances, and on the eve of events which have profoundly shaken Germany and which were bound to have considerable effect in the Saar, we have been able to maintain public order and safety.   The inhabitants of the Saar realise this.At present our principal care is to prepare for the elections for the municipal assemblies and for those of the Districts whose powers have virtually expired.   We wish to reconstitute the local assemblies as soon as possible,&quot;being inspired by democratic ideas and by the stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles, in order to meet the wishes of the population and to assure for ourselves the administrative co-operation that we need.     He will do all in our power to win the confidence and the esteem of the population by a prudent, firm and far-sighted administration.In the name of the Governing Commission of tho Territory of the Saar Basin.(Signed)     V* RAULT,President, State Councillor.
SAAKBHUOiC,25th February, 1920.PPOCLAMAT action to the inhabitants of the Tej^rjji^cabinet^ of&apos; the oaariUnder the terms of xhe Treaty of Peace of Versailles, the Governing Commission enters upon its duties as from the present date.     In the&apos; name of the ^eague of Nations, which has established it, the Commission will administer the Territory of the oaar Basin and will esexcise all the powers which formerly belonged to the German empire, Prussia and Bavaria.   It is determined te -earry out strictly the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, and to enforce respect on th.- part of all for these clauses, both in the letter -,nd in spirit. .Being firml;, resolved to impose respect for its authority, it will fearlessly suppiess all attempts, from whatever source, to disturb or mislead the population/  It will tolerate neither open violence,  intrigue, nor passive resistance.     The Treaty of Peace does not leave it without the necessary authority, and-the powers conferred will permit the CDmraisi!ion to devote itself to its task without being troubled with useless and criminal opposition.The Commission considers that maintenance of peace and order throughout the Territory of the baar is its first duty,.    It undertakes to enforce respect for the rights and well-being of the population,     Under its control, the inhabitants will retain their local assemblies, their religious liberties, their associations,, their schools and their language.     The protection of their persons and property will be provided for.In the exercise of its authority and in its administration, the Governing Commission will be inspired by the principles which directed the establishment of the League of Nations;    it is inspired by the most liberal and friendly feelings towards the population, whose care has been antrusted to it,     It will try to restore the prosperity of the country and to reassure the public mind,     It knows that a prolonged period of uncertainty has affected legitimate interests;,    It intends to establish a stable regime and regular administration in the Territory. ,Its attention has already been drawn to some particularly urgent problems. .   It will try to solve without delay the financial, customs and commercial problems about which the inhabitants of. the Territory are naturally concerned.     It will not allow the inhabitants t.3 be exploited nor inadequately paid for their labour.The Governing Commission will concern itself specially with the development of industry and the condition of the workers.. . It intends to encourage production with all its power and to assure to the employees and worKers all the advantages compatible with thesmooth running of the production undertakings..     In this respeot it will take into -consideration the wishes expressed by the local Labour Organizations as well as the principles adopted by the League of Nations. .   It feels certain that in pursuing this policy, it will be working in complete agreement with the French &apos; Administration of the Mines. ,   On the other hand, ,it will guarantee to  ranee a free exploitation of the mines as laid down in the Treaty. .ANITFX &quot;B&quot; .
It relies on the hearty co-ope ration of the populations in carrying out its mandate.     f.ihe population, by remaining calm and showing good will towards the authorities, will show its confidence in the League of Nations and itsrrsop&amp;rt for the Treaty.      By devotion.to its work it will contribute to the economio restoration of Lurbpe.     Called upon  ;t&apos;o share in the necessary work of reparation, it .will not shrink from this duty; it will be a point of honour for it to a].ply the principles of international co-operation laid down in the Covenant of the League of Nations.Those principles will continually guide the Governing Commission.       Et intends, with tho lo^ul.collaboration of the inhabitants, to maintain order, liberty and justice in the Territory, to as.ure to the population respect for its rights, together with its material welfare ;nd prosperity.The Governing Commission of the Territory of the Saar Basin:V&quot;.
