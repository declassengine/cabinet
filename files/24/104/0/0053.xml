SjB^tffSECRET.&apos;w1 0*      /co THE CABINET.THE FUTURE UNIFORM AND DRESS OF THE REGULARARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. During the war the size of the Regular Army was enormously increased, and      55 the whole force was under active service conditions.   It was, therefore, unnecessary to Gen. No. provide the new troops with any dress beyond the Service uniform, and officers were     799 not required to provide themselves with anything but Service dress.2. Now that the country has reverted to peace conditions the situation has entirely changed, and it is necessary to provide the other ranks of the Army with uniform clothing in addition to their working dress, and to require officers also to provide themselves with additional uniform and equipment.3. Two alternatives only appear to be possible : (a.) To lay down for the Army, as additional uniform, a pattern similar to the working dress.(6.) To revert, for full dress,, to something similar to the uniform in force in 1914.4. The first alternative would involve a smaller expenditure, and the Army Council in considering the matter have given full weight to the question of economy.On the other hand, the adoption of this alternative would seriously undermine regimental esprit de corps, and eventually adversely affect both recruiting and discipline.5. In view of the great importance and far reaching effect of a decision on this question, the whole subject was referred to a committee, presided over by General Sir J. A. Murray, and arrangements were made by the Committee to gather opinions throughout all the ranks of the Service, and to make their investigation as comprehensive as possible.The Murray Committee, who were fully impressed with the advantages from the point of view of economy of adopting the Service pattern for the additional uniform, recommended, in view of the strong body of opinion which was placed before them, that this course could not be adopted.6. The Army Council have made an independent review of the subject, and are satisfied that a reversion for the additional uniform to something on the lines of the 1914 pattern is essential so long as the basis of recruitment of our Army in peace is that of voluntary enlistment. They consider that it would be unsafe to adopt in peace time a universal Service pattern for all purposes, and to sweep away the different uniforms which have been associated for many years with hallowed traditions of the various regiments.Sentiment is a factor of extreme importance in the case of a voluntary Army, both as regards recruiting and discipline in peace and esprit de corps in war, aud the distinctive uniforms of the various regiments have a sentimental hold on the men, which it is considered could not be replaced.7. The Army Council consider, however, that certain modifications in the 1914 full dress can be introduced which will decrease the expenditure involved, and at the same time make the dress more comfortable.If the Cabinet approve the recommendation to reintroduce the full dress, the pattern which the Army Council recommend will contain modifications under these two heads.8. The expense falling on the public in consequence of the introduction of full dress would in the case of officers be confined to the initial allowance towards outfit on first joining or on first being required to provide themselves with full dress, which it is proposed to fix at  150, and to which the Government are already committed by the conditions of pay which were published in September last.    This allowance will,(B20/191)   100  4/20  h&amp;S  8155wo
generally speaking, go a long way towards covering the initial cost of the uniform for an Infantrv officer, though for Household Cavalry, Foot Guards, Cavalry and Royal Horse Artillery the sum will have to be more fully supplemented from private sources.As regards the other ranks, the expenditure consists of the provision throughout the Service annually of the uniform required or allowance in lieu.9. In view of the importance of announcing a decision of this question at an early date, at any rate in general terms, the matter is submitted to the Cabinet for a decision in principle.J.O. It is not considered essential that the reintroduction of full dress either for officers or other ranks should be completed within 1 year, and it is suggested that the process might be spread over a period of 3 and 4 years, priority being given on the following basis: (a.) The Guards.(b.) Units in United Kingdom.(c.) Units abroad.The necessary provision on this basis has been made in the Estimates, and if the reintroduction of full dress is approved in principle by the Cabinet, definite proposals will be prepared for submission to the King.11. The question of uniform for the Special Reserve and Territorial Force is being dealt with separately.12. The question has been submitted to the Treasury, in letter 55/Gen. No. 790/F. 5, of the 19th March, 1920, but they do not concur in the proposals which have been put forward.   A copy of the correspondence is attached.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.22nd April, 1920.
APPENDIX..o5/Gen. No./790.  (P. 5.)19/% March, 1920.Sir,I am commanded .by the Aimy Council to state that they have had under consideration the Report of the Committee presided over by Sir A. J. Murray, appointed to consider the future uniform for officers and men of the Regular Army,As their Loiclships are aware, except in the case of the Household Cavalry, full dress uniform was not provided during the war, the troops wearing Service dress uniform on all occasions, but the Committee have recommended that, now that peace conditions are returning, full dress should be reintroduced, broadly on the lines of the pre-war system. Similarly they propose that full and mess dress should be resumed for officers; undress will be eliminated.While the Council would have desired to avoid the expenditure which such reproduction would neces-sarily entail they have been convinced, both by the weight of the evidence placed before the Committee and by an independent review of the question, that it is essential for an Army recruited in peace by voluntary enlistment to have full dress. They do not consider that it would be practicable or politic, so long as the Army is recruited by voluntary enlistment, to do away with the different uniforms which are associated with the traditions of the various regiments or to confine the whole Army to a uniform pattern of Service dress. They, therefore, have endorsed the recommendation of the Murray Committee in principle, and are anxious to make a start-as soon as possible with a scheme to put the principle into operation.A careful review of the detailed proposals of the Murray Committee has been made, with the object of eliminating all unessential and expensive details and of securing that the uniform adopted is as simple and inexpensive as circumstances will permit.(1.) Officers.As their Lordships are aware, the principle of granting an initial outfit allowance to officers has already been accepted by the Fisher Committee, and was enunciated in Army Order 324 of 1919, but the Council could not decide upon its amount until the various articles of full, mess and Service dress uniform had been prescribed.They now propose that the allowance for officers commissioned during peace time shall be fixed (for the present and subject to review according to the course of prices) at  150, this sum being as nearly as possible the present cost (estimated in detail at  147), of an Infantry officers&apos; outfit, exclusive of the cost of camp kit, binoculars, revolver and steel helmet which are ptovided free in addition. This grant, though based on Infantry patterns, will apply to other arms the cost for which is in all cases higher, and in many cases considerably so, and will apply also to Infantry Quartermasters who at present get a special rate of  100; but Quartermasters of other arms will get an addition representing the excess cost of their outfit over an Infantry outfit. To a Quartermaster commissioned in the Hussars, for instance, about  100 extra would be issuable, the approximate, total cost being  250. Further, to officers commissioned from the ranks in the ordinary way, in their first few years of service  50 more than for Quartermasters will be given, for the provision of articles, other than outer garments, necessary to a man starting his career as an officer^ on the . same lines as at present.The Council have also had under consideration the position of Regular officers already serving; these fall into two classes : (a.) Officers appointed during the war.(bi) Officers appointed prior to 4th August, 1914.The officers at (a), with the exception of those promoted to permanent commissions whilst serving in the ranks or a peace attestation, received an outfit grant ( 50 for the majority), which was only intended to cover the provision of Service dress, Such officers should now draw the difference between their original grant (minus the included allowance for camp kit, which is now in principle to be free) and that now sanctioned, as it would be unreasonable to expect them to provide full and mess dress from their own pockets when the newly appointed officer, who has not rendered war service, receives a grant to cover the cost of all three uniforms.The officers at (b) ou the other hand, who were already serving before the war, were required to be in possession both of full and mess dress in addition to Service dress, and the Council do not, therefore, consider that they have any claim to be refunded anything but the actual cost of alterations necessitated by change of pattern dr detail or the addition of new items of kit which were not part of the prescribed dress before the war. Any such officers, for instance, required to provide themselves with a shako would be refunded  10 the estimated cost They are, however, of opinion that the cost af alterations or provision of new items rendered necessary solely by the lapse of time, must be borne by the individual officer. The expenditure on -account of these officers will not be great, as they will be allowed to wear full dress uniform of the pre-war pattern for a period of 5 years, before the end of which a certain number will become due to retire.The total initial cbst of these proposals is estimated at about  1,200,000, of which it is proposed that .-.-some  300,000, representing issues to British officers serving in India, should be borne by Indian funds. This point will be taken up with the India Office. Against this figure must be set the sum of  150,000 which, had full dress not been reintroduced, would have been required to cover the cost of additional Service dress for ceremonial occasions. Thus the net initial cost consequent upon the reintroduction of full and mess dress may be estimated at  1.050,000. As with the scheme for the reiutroduction of full dress for other ranks, detailed below, the Council propose that the expenditure on full dress shall be spread over a period of three years; though mess dreos will be introduced simultaneously throughout the Army at an early date. The charge which it is estimated will be required for the coming financial year will be  250,000 leaving  470,000 to fall into the year 1921-22, and  480,000 to fall into 1922-23. The normal annual charge will be approximately  75,000 in addition to  35,000 for new entrants.(2.) Warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men.While the data for estimating the cost are meagre and the price at which red, blue and green cloth aud the material for head-dresses will be obtainable is uncertain it is estimated that the initial expense of providing full dress clothing for an Army approximating in strength to the pre-war regular Army on the
British Establishment (excluding the Household Cavalry who have retained their full dress uniform through-out the war, the Boyal Hying Corps, Native Indian troops, the Special Reserve, the Territorial Force), and the British Army on the Indian Establishment, say 230,000 men in all, would be  2,470,000. The recurring expenditure for maintenance of the proportion of these troops on the pre-war British Establishment (say 166,000) would be  746,000. Against the recurring expenditure must be set the fact that if full dress were not reintroduced the consumption of Service dress would necessarily be increased, probably to the extent of&quot; some  220,000 a year. So that the net increase in expenditure involved by this reintroduction would be  5^,4-70,000 lor initial cost and  526/K)0 recurring expenditure.While the cost of new full dress clothing sent or taken to India falls, under the established rules, on Indian funds, it is possible that there may be a counter-claim of substantial amount by the Indian Govern-ment for clothing in possession of troops that left India for the war. In default of knowledge on this point, the above figure for initial outfit includes that for troops in India estimated at  330,000.The above figures are based on proposals made after a careful revision of the recommendations of the Murray Committee with a view to securing as simple and inexpensive a uniform as circumstances will, permit, and to eliminating so far as possible all unessential and expensive details not only in the scheme recommended by the Murray Committee but also in the pre-war standard. By this review savings estimated over  250,000 on initial provision and  30,000 on annual expenditure have been made.It is recognized that it would be impracticable to carry out the eomptete programme in the course of a single financial year, and it is therefore,proposed to spread the reintroduction of the full dress scheme over 2 or 3 years. Provision has accordingly been made to the extent of over  400,000 for the current financial year, and it is proposed that  1,000,000 shall 1 e spent in the year 1921-22, the balance of  1,070,000 falling into the year 1922-23.The question of the expenditure involved in provision for the Special Reserve and Territorial Force will he submitted separately.1 am to request you to be good enough to move their Lordships to accord their early sanction to the CounciFs proposals both for officers and men.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.^1     II. J. Creed v.The Secretary.The Treasury.55/Gen. No./799.   13186/20.Treasury Chambers,7th April, 1920.Sir,I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury Sir B. Cubittfs letter of the 19th ultimo (No. 55/Gen. No./790 (P. 5)), formulating the proposals of the Army Council for the reintroduction in the Army of full dress and mess dress broadly on pre-war lines, and I am to request you to lay before the Army Council the following reply :-Under these proposals, the cost of the normal outfit of an Infantry officer, excluding camp kit, binoculars, revolver and steel helmet, which are to be provided free, and garments other than outer garments, will be no less than  150. The cost in other arms will be greater, and in some arms considerably greater, amounting for example in the Hussars to  250.-Although the Council propose that the charge on public funds in respect of officers&apos;uniforms should,, except in the case of officers commissioned from the ranks and Quartermasters, be limited to the cost of an Infantry officers initial outfit, the net additional initial expenditure involved for the Regular Forces, excluding .cost of articles provided directly at the public charge, is estimated at  1,050,000 for officers and  2,470,000 for other ranks, or  3,520,000 in all. The additional net recurrent cost is estimated at  75,000 per annum for officers and at  526,000 per annum for other ranks, or  581,000 a year in all.! In addition the proposals now under consideration will set the scale for expenditure in the Territorial Force a,nd the Reserves; and the amount of outfit allowances to be granted to officers of the Royal Air Force^and ultimately no doubt of the Navy, will be determined by the grants made to Army officers. The proposals also impose a heavy future charge upon Army officers for the renewal of expensive uniforms.       ,My Lords are unable to contemplate expenditure on this scale on provision of uniform. The opinion of the Council that adherence to khaki uniforms would be prejudicial to recruiting is incapable of proof, and was strongly dissented from by several witnesses before the Dress and Uniform Committee.My Lords are certain on the other hand that, at a time when the absolute necessity for public and private economy is being urged on every hand, and not least by the Ministers of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the general upinion of the country would bitterly resent a step by which the minimum cost of the uniforms, required by a Second Lieutenant would be from  150 to  250 or possibly more according to arm, and would decline to accept an apprehension that. recruiting would be injured by, the present dress as any justification fo so costly a policy.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,i - &apos; (Signed)  G. L. Barstow.The Secretary,  ,War Office.
