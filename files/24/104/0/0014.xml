&quot;4ICJCP. .11 14     )ip!&apos;(P31J^?v/ From Ficero?/, 17i/i .4pr^ J920. ,I^LLG^^X30NFIDENTIAL(Weceiyed 20th, l.p.m.)453 S. Your telegram of 19th March received 25th. Afghan Envoy for Peking. Lampson&apos;s telegram of 30th March, No. 172, has since been received. All A.rnir&apos;s actions since signing of peace treaty point to increasing desire of Afghanistan to pose as fully independent and civilised nation, and we see no probability of her consenting, in course of any negotiations which can at present be anticipated, to restore our control of her foreign relations in any shape. Only prospect of ultimate reversion to former status seems to lie in her being given all the rope she wants. If she then finds herself hopelessly embarrassed she may turn again to us for advice. If on the other hand we now seek by subterranean means to prevent other Powers from entering into direct relations with her she will certainly attribute their refusal to us and only become more suspicious and hostile. Moreover, we have no locus standl for preventing unfriendly Powers such as Germany from entering into relations with her, and if we prevent friendly Powers from doing so result will only be that unfriendly influence will be unchallenged at Kabul. There would of course be great possibility of embarrassment in presence at Kabul of representatives of other Powers such as Turkey, Russia, Persia, China, Japan, Germany and France, but their intrigues would probably neutralise one another and perplex the Afghans, while we should always exercise predominant influence from our geographical position in the same way as Czarist Russia did at Teheran. . Moreover, presence of numerous foreign representatives at Kabul which Amir seems to desire can hardly fail in the long run to act as solvent to harsh and fanatical spirit of Afghans to break down their isolation and make them much less unpleasant and dangerous neighbours than they have hitherto been. We think, therefore, that wisest course would be to recognise new status of Afghanistan boldly, with all its implications, and to inform China that Afghanistan is free to enter into direct diplomatic relations with her, and that she must exercise her own discretion whether she will allow her to do so. China might at the same time be told.that the only foreign representative at present in Kabul is that of Bolsheviks.
