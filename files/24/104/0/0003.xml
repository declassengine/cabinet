[This Document isthe Property of His Britannic Majestys Gover^erit]CONFIDENTIAL. (11526)Political Intelligence Department Foreign Office.Denmark/010. &apos;MEMORANDUMONTHE DANISH GOVERNMENT CRISIS.THE recent Danish crisis passed as suddenly as it rose. A new Government is in power, and enjoys a large measure of support. The date of the election is provisionally settled. The general strike is over. The Folketing has met once more. It might seem from a rapid survey that all is as before; but this is not the case, and it is important to appreciate the change that has taken place.1. The Rigsdag^adjourned for the Easter recess with the Zahle Ministry still in possession of its small majority (3 or 4). No adverse vote had been passed in the Folketing, though a vote of &quot; No confidence &quot; had been carried in the Landsting on the 3rd December. The Government&apos;s South Jutland policy was not popular. A perfectly prudent attitude rarely commands widespread support in the face of inflamed nationalism. But the Opposition had not sufficient confidence in their support to challenge the Government openly. They had voted with the Government on the 23rd October, 1918, &quot; that no change in the status of Slesvig except one based on the principles of nationality would accord with the desires, feelings and interests of the Danish people.&quot; When the draft treaty containing the provision for voting in the Third Zone became public (in May 1919) only the Conservatives dissented, from the confirmation of the resolution of&apos; the 23rd October. Many prudent people thought that the economic factors might lead to a solution in Southern Slesvig on lines other than nationality; and the Rigsdag confirmed their decision to abide by that one test. The Conservatives did not dissociate themselves from this point of view; but maintained that by taking that course the Rigsdag would dissipate the good-will of the Peace Conference. The Opposition attempted (July 30, 1919) to compel the Government to insist on the evacuation of the Third Zone when the Third Zone clause was omitted from the treaty. But up to that time all parties at least officially claimed a decision in Slesvig on lines of nationality alone. During the interval between the presentation of the treaty to Germany and the actual voting in Slesvig, the Nationalists have done their best to upset the Government; and their line of attack is of considerable interest. It was suggested that the Government would not accept Flensborg the real crux of the Slesvig question if the Inter-national Commission offered it. Behind this position was the admission that the Danes could not hope to secure Flensborg on a majority of votes. The enthusiastic put the Danish vote sometimes as high as 40 per cent.; but no one expected that it would be greater than the German vote. The latest mood of the Nationalists was to pass, resolutions of &quot; Confidence in the decision of the International Commission,&quot; after the fashion of calling upon Providence when the case is quite hopeless. The rural districts of the Second Zone voted as heavily for Germany as Flensborg. This was a heavy blow; and votes of &quot; Confidence &quot; were the only hope. It is to be noted that even at this point there was no attempt to challenge the Government in the Folketing.2. So matters stood when the Rigsdag rose on the 27th March. But on that day a new factor was involved. It was reported from Flensborg that the Inter-national Commission had decided in favour of giving the whole Second Zone to Germany, and that M. Claudel, the French Minister and French member of the Commission, was entrusted with the task of carrying the Commission^ report to the Supreme Council. This marked the position as almost desperate. M. Claudel. was known to favour the policy of alienating German territory on general grounds,, and although the Second &apos;Zone was almost signed away, there was therefore a loophole. The Opposition with M. Marott (Socialist), M. Jensen and M. Mosgaard-Kjoldsen at once issued declarations in favour of an immediate51   [2905]
election * The Governments majority seemed to have disappeared; and certain politicians pointed out this fact to King Christian. The Government had no majority in the Landsting, and now in the Folketing they could only command half the Chamber. It is reported that the Empress Dowager and Prince Valdemar, recently returned from this country, also made representations to the King. AVhatever the cause, King Christian \s action was prompt. On the 29th March he called upon Hr. Zahle to resign and, on his refusal, dismissed him. King Christian is a man of conspicuous courage, and he had acted hitherto with prudence and skill. On this occasion he acted with little foresight. Hr. Zahle, without a majority in either House, might safely have been left to shift for himself and endeavour to avoid the fate which would certainly befall one who had become so thoroughly disliked as, it must be said, is generally the case with Denmark&apos;s strong statesmen. The King well knew that the Government was unpopular. He believed that it had lost the support of both Houses; and it was therefore both reasonable and right for him to call for Hr. Zahle&apos;s resignation.3. How then did the Constitutional question arise? As soon as Hr. Zahle refused to resign the King would have been wiser to withdraw. When he dismissed the Premier, he laid himself open to the charge of joining with the opponents of the Government. The Government had not formally lost the confidence of the Folketing; and the matter was capable of being settled by the simple test of allowing Hr. Zahle to present himself before the House once more. The King, however, could not wait. Time pressed. The latest solution of the Chauvinists was that the Second Zone should be internationalised. The internationalisation of Tondern (which voted German and is, in fact, a thoroughly German enclave in the First Zone) or of the Third Zone (which has also its Danish population) might be claimed with equal justice, But neither Justice nor dignity were in the ascendant with the Nationalist minority. The Liberals had forsaken them. The cause seemed almost lost. Hence the King&apos;s precipitate action, which presented the Radicals and Socialists with so formidable a battle-cry. The second factor which threw the Constitution into the struggle was the widespread report that it wTas no party but the Dowager Empress and Prince Valdemar who had inspired the Eoyal action. And this was supported by the fact that none of the parties would join battle openly in the Folketing and none of the parties would take office. Fir. Zahle refused to &quot; carry on &quot; until a new Government was ready, and the Social Democratic Party issued a manifesto branding the King&apos;s action as unconstitutional and clamouring for a republic.4. On the 30th March, M. Otto Liebe, a lawyer of the Supreme Court, formed a &quot; Cabinet d&apos;Affaires,&quot; and the amalgamated trade unions demanded the re-establishment of a &quot; Constitutional regime &quot; by the recall of the Zahie Cabinet, failing which they threatened to declare a general strike. It was decided later that the strike would not be quite general, and that it would be deferred over the Easter holidays. The new Government and the Socialists met frequently, and the latter . offered to countermand the general strike if the Government would summon the Rigsdag for the purpose of passing the Electoral Bill. Some sections of the workers ceased work at once. &quot; Social-Demokraten &quot; wrote &quot;Be ready for a popular rising stronger than that which in 1848 overturned absolutism.&quot; On the 31st March the Trade Union Congress unanimously decided to begin the general strike on Tuesday, the 6th April, to compel the Government to convene the Rigsdag so that an electoral reform measure may be passed, and to secure the cancellation of* the lock-out declared for the 9th April.   The terms are to be noted, for it will be seen that when* The terms of the resolutions are worthy of note.The Conservative Party&apos;s Statement was : &quot; The Slesvig question is now at its last stage, and the Danish people in spite of Government promises-have never been given the opportunity to express their desires in the matter. If the Danish people are to have any influence on the final decision it is absolutely imperative that elections for the Folketing should be held at once. The dropping of the suggested constitutional reforms has put off the passing of new constitutional and electoral lawn for an indefinite time. The Constitutional Party demands, therefore, as the indisputable right of the people, an immediate dissolution of Parliament and new elections so that the final negotiations regarding South Jutland may be carried out by men enjoying the confidence of the people.&quot;The Left Party&apos;s Statement was &quot; As the elections of 1918 were war elections and a promise was then made that new elections should take place when the war was over, and also in consideration of the fact that the present Government and its supporters have not the authority of the electors 1o take the final decision in our national question, the Left Party in the Rigsdag wish to say that they consider that it is now an absolute necessity that a new election should take place.&quot;
the crisis passed it was by the King bowing to them. As the crisis dragged on, the rowdiness in the metropolis grew. On the night of the 31st the Socialists and Syndicalists held open-air meetings, and large crowds streamed towards j the Amalienborg Palace crying &quot;Down with the King ! &quot; and &quot;Long live the Republic ! &quot; There was no attempt to rush the police- cordon on this occasion; but there was greater violence shown later, and attempts to bring the troops to the capital resulted in a refusal of railwayman to work the troop trains. Negotiations w,ere still proceeding when the new Government, on the 2nd April, issued a proclamation dissolving the Rigsdag on the 21st April and ordering a general election on the 22nd April. The Rigsdag was to meet on the 14th April and non-contentious measures would be passed. By this proclamation the new Government tacitly decided against the Electoral Bill, since, though the measure had been before the Rigsdag since November, it had not yet been passed. On the 3rd April the situation seemed more critical than ever. The general strike appeared to be inevitable. Ships were already missing their sailings.5. It was then that King Christian summoned representatives of all political parties to a conference.   Great efforts had been made to effect a compromise; and in the eight hours&apos; conference, which began at 9 p.m. that night, there must have been many moments when tempers wore thin.    From the glimpses which have appeared in the Danish press it is clear that the discussion lacked nothing of realism. At one point M. Liebe is reported to have said &quot; If you call the strike off I&apos;ll debate all these points.&quot;    The reply made to the King was &quot; That is too late now, your Majesty.&quot;   The Conference ended in the morning of Easter Sunday with the resignation of the Liebe Government.   It was agreed that M. Friis, Public Trustee, should form another &quot;Cabinet d&apos;Affaires&quot; of senior officials, that the Rigsdag was to be summoned at once, and to pass an Electoral Bill in preparation for a general election to be held on the 21st April, or as soon afterwards as possible.   The general strike was to be called off as soon as the technical difficulties between the Employers&apos; Association and Workmen&apos;s Unions could be settled.   The orders for a lock-out and a general strike were at once annulled, and though there was some rioting in Copenhagen on Sunday night it was not of a serious character.   The new Govern ment has for its Foreign Minister Herr Otto Scavenius, cousin of the Foreign Minister in the Zahle Cabinet and Director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    By this may be measured the extent of the King&apos;s defeat.   He had interfered in the Slesvig question, quite properly, but inprudently, by dismissing the Cabinet which had taken up a standpoint with which he was completely out of sympathy.   He was compelled to take as his new Foreign Minister one of the men who was most closely associated with the Zahle Ministry policy. The Liebe Cabinet had attempted to show its Nationalist sympathies on the Slesvig question.   If &quot; Social-Demokraten &quot; can be trusted, the new Ministry is composed of men who are all known to be in favour of the Zahle policy.   The King had had to retrace his steps.   But the position is not the same as it was before.   The demand for a republic has now been placed openly in the Social Democrats&apos; programme and the King has suffered in prestige.   It is commonly held that a revolution in Denmark is unthinkable.   The King is so deservedly popular; but his real support lies among the peasantry; and the recent crisis has shown how7 slight their influence may be a,gainst the political organisation of the Radicals and Socialists.7. As to the cause of the crisis-the disposition of the Second Slesvig Zone  the best that could happen to Denmark is that the Supreme Council should at once declare its decision to adhere to the results of the voting. The voting was held with certain conditions in favour of a Danish decision. The Germans are already accusing the Allies of attempting to bias the result by their decision as to the final disposition of the shipping. In the last resort it is an excellent thing that this decision was published, for it is evident that even with considerable advantages the Danes could not prevail upon the voters of the Second Zone to choose Denmark, If Flensborg goes to Germany the northern hinterland will naturally drain into Aabenraa, and this will become an important Danish port. The Clausen line, the boundary of the First Zone, is sufficiently good as a first approximation to a frontier before the final line can be delimited on the spot, as provided by the Peace Treaty.-   April7,m0.
