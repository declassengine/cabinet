No.71.For the wock ondod 24th April, 1920,.BALTIC AND NORTH RUSSIA.s.s. &quot;DONGOLA&quot; sailed from Coponhagen on 20th April for Southampton.     British Legation at Copenhagen;! have asked Yrticther thero is any objection from a Naval point of view to tho use of Rcval in the near future as tho port of disembarkation of Russians repatriated from Europe in British Ships.   Senior Naval Officer, Copenhagen, has boon informed that, in view of the foot that this would entail a lengthening of the voyage and tho provision of an escort it is not intended that those ships should bo sent to Reval.     It is not tho policy of H.k. Government for H.k. Ships to visit Rcval at present.The Ivdlitary Lisslon, Reval, reports that the Bolshevik Fleet is ready for sea, and gives details of ships, which corroborate previous information in the Intelligence Division.Rear-Admiral Sir \U Cowan sailed for the Baltic in H.L.S. &quot;DELHI&quot; on 24th April to take over the duties of Senior Naval Officer, Baltic.Flensborg Force.Vice-Admiral, H.k.S. &quot;CARYSFORT&quot;, reported on 21st April that the proposals for the new frontier between Denmark and Germany had been signed..Sir Charles karling left Flensborg on 22nd April in H.i, .S. &quot;STORLCLOUD&quot; for Paris via Copenhagen and visiting London en route.     H.k*.S . &quot;STORLCLOUD&quot; will not return to Flensborg after landing Sir Charles harling at Harwich.Vice-Admiral, II .1,1 .S . &quot;CARYSFORT&quot;, has been asked if an approximate date can now be given for the withdrawal of his Force-.Esthonia.It is difficult at the moment to report on the exact state of feeling entertained towards the Entente by the Esthonian Government.   It is considered, however, that In any case Esthonia is afraid to show active antipathy towards the Allies owing to her enormous indebtedness to the United States of America and Great Britaino     The masses are bein^: subjected to active Bolshevik propaganda, which finds fertile soil in view of the privations due to the high cost of living and unemploymentj on the other hand, they are much too interested in their future domestic rela-tions with Russia to pay much attention one way or the other to the Entente.&apos;   It is probable, however, that the Secret Clauses in the Soviet Peace Treaty denyin   the use of their ports to foreign irien-of-war for ilaval action against the Soviet Government will be respected.Latvia.Present elections indicate that public opinion bac;;s the present Government, who will be returned.   The Government peace negotiations with Russia continue.Lithuania/
Lithuania.H. iii CominIssloner reports that Lithuanians propose a commercial treaty with Germany covering six to twelve months, to facilitate the exchange of goods and to secure redemption of German marks now current in Lithuania.     British interests are affected through the flax and timber trade.   The Lithuanian Government state that they are prepared to send delegates to Moscow for peace negotiations with Soviet Government. Deliberations should commence in Eay.Trade.HcL. Government has decided to grant passports to the British Labour group to visit Finland and Esthonia.   The delegates will in all probability proceed Into Russia.Unfavourable reports as to Russian capacity to supply goods in exchange for British imports continue to be received. It is not expected that there will be any marked improvement until the chaotic state of Russian transport is changed by complete reorganisation under able direction, which must be foreign^ and supply of necessary rolling-stock on railways.Denmark.Reports received indicate considerable industrial unrest, and Copenhagen is stated to be full of undesirable Bolsheviks, camp followers of Litvinoff and his entourage.Finland.kr. George Kidston, O.L.G., is proceeding in a few days to Eelsingfors to relive Lord Acton as H.3.ivi. Liinister to Finland.   Lord iicton reports that he has been informed by the Finnis   Prime Linister that there is little prospect of success-fui negotiations for armistice between Finland and Russia, owing to the fact that Russia declines the readiest for the establish-ment of a neutral zone in Karelia^ and insists on a free water-way through the Gulf of Finland.   On this latter point the Finnish Government hesitate to give way, as they are unaware as to attitude of British Government towards such a concession.   The Prime Linis-ter is urgently anxious to know definite British Naval Policy and whether acceding to the free water-way request would prejudice in any way British plans for the continuance of the Naval blockade. The Finnish Government emphasise their previous request for a visit of British men-of-war to Bjorko in order to give naval support during the negotiations,   beanwhile the Foreign Office have stated that in reply to the Admiralty enquiry, they concur in the Admiralty proposal as to desirability of sending men-of-war to visit Finnish ports as soon as ice clears.The latest information is that General Mannerhein^s anti-British views have been much exaggerated and that he is friendly to Great Britain.It is reported that the German ship &quot;BALTIC&quot; from Lubeck. has arrived at Helsingfors with munitions of war, believed destined for the Finnish Protective Corps, which, has the reputation of being aggressively pro-GermaneNorth Russia.H.k. Icebreaker &quot;SVIATOGOR&quot; sailed from Rosyth to Bergen on 23rd April for Kara Sea Relief Expedition.   She will be turned over to the Norwegian Government at this port, the British crew returning by the most convenient routeo   The British CollierUNDiMHORST,/

Seid Attdul Kadir is willing enough to co-operate, but does not want to commit himself until he is certain that the Kurdish aspirations will be realised (i.ec, emancipation from direct Turkish rule and some form of British protection).The British High Commissioner proposes to tell them both that if such a movement can be organised without inflaming the Kurdish provinces (which he considers very doubtful), the British Government will have no objection, but that any arrangement of that nature cannot impair the right of the Peace Conference to settle the Kurdish question on the reccgnised principles of the self determination of the population as a whole.Admiral de Robeck has been informed that his proposals for supporting the present Turkish Government against the Nationalists by permitting the use of loyalist Turkish troops and the encouragement of irregular anti-nationalist   risings are approved subject to the following considerations(a) That Turkish regulars should be employed wherever possible instead of irreguaars;(b) That Damad Ferid should understand clearly thatthere is no prospect of lenient peace terms, in order that there be no possibility of his accusing us of perfidy later on.The Anzavur anti-nationalist movement in the Panderma area has collapsed and the nationalists have again occupied the townnAnzavur had moved from Panderma via Liichalich to Kirmasti, his apparent intention being to occupy Brussa.   On the 16th instant his force was attacked at Kirmasti and, suffered a severe reverse, losing a considerable number of prisoners. Anzavur retired to Panderma with 500 me.-i, the remainder of his force splitting up and moving further west.By the/UNLENMORST., with 4,000 tone ?f ooal, will leave the Tyne during the week for Tromsoe, where the Norwegian Government will take over the cargo of coal and the vessel will be sent home a    The Norwegian Government, in consultation with the leader of the expedition, Captain Otto Sverdrup, have decided that it is not necessary that the Icebreaker KOShA kINIIvi should follow the expeditions   They ask whether SVTAT0G0R is insured in England, and presume that theyheed not concern themselves with insurance * The British Naval Attache, Copenhagen, has been given Instructions to facilitate the turning over of the SVI^TOGOR and repatriation of British crew0   All possible details of ship, radius of action and stores carried have been sent to the Foreign Office for communication to the Norwegian Government?MEDITERRANEAN AND BLACK SEA o
A report has been received at Constantinople to the effect that the situation at Adana is becoming daily more serious, and that the lives of Europeans are In danger.   The British Government have asked the French Government what stops they are taking to me -at the situation and have urged upon them the necessity for action.Aintab was again relieved on April 16th, after a fight in which the French suffered slight loss.Orimea.0-in-C, Lediterranevn, reports tnat on 18th April the Whites assumed the offensive and landed troops in Karkinit Bay and North cf Ghenichesk combined with advance on Perekop peninsula.   All operations were successful and much ground gained and guns captured.   The unites now hold 5 versts N.E. of Perekop, the Chongar Peninsula and outskirts of Ghenichesk.   Landing parties have occupied Efremovka (H .E. of Ghenichesk)) and Khcrli (Karkinit Bay)*General  range1 has placed himself unreservedly in the hands of H .k. Government for negotiations with Bolsheviks.The Soviet Government have again replied in an evasive manner to H.L. Government1s offer to mediate during proposed armistice negotiations between General  range 1, C-in-C, Crimea White Army, and the Soviet Forces.   Lord purzon has sent a further communication dated 24th April in which he re-itorates the reasons why H .k* Government offered to mediate, and. points cut that Soviet Army continues to advance along the coast road towards Eatoum, which is held by a British Garrison.   This constitutes a direct act of war, which H.L. Forces are bound to, and will, resists Meanwhile, C-in-C, Mediterranean has been instructed to render all possible   assistance to protect/the Crimea from being invaded, provided no men are landed.   The operations are to be continued until the Soviet Government commences to negotiate with General &quot; range 1.Ku b a. n a ncl C au c a su s *Hah. Ships continue to shell the Bolsheviks on coast road in the vicinity of Sochi.   The C-in-C, Mediterranean, withFlag/pi    /q.    k-*By the 19th instant the Nationalists forces (including apparently the bulk of the Gist regular Turkish division from Baiikesr and of the 5Gtli division from Brussa) had occupied Panders a with some 5,000 menj other detachments, about 2,000 strong in all, moved on Ecllnjik and Brdek.Anzavur is believed to have gone towards Bigha; his forces have been broken up, and there seems no possibility of his being able to organise any further movement against the nationalist: for some time to come, if ever..The Grand Vizier was arranging to send him supplies of rifles and ammunition from Constantinople with General Miners consent, but for various reasons thane were not sent in time.According to information from well informed quarters, the Sultan is believed to be delighted at the overthrow of the Rationalists in the capital by the Entente Powers, which has reliev him o^Vtne unpleasant necessity of waking head against them and perhapls/at tempting a similar 1 coup1 with inferior forces and considerable risk of failure which would probably have cost him his popularity - if not his throne.Adana*
would/Flag in H.&amp;;.S. &quot;AJAX&quot;, has visited Sochi and is visiting Qagri, Poti and Batoum to view the situation; the Lllitary Governor 630. Batoum accompanies him.   He reports that Red Forces are now at River Sakhe, 17-g- miles from Sochi.   White Forces, which consist of Kuban and Don Cossacks, with the assistance of K*iv-. Ships and aircraft from II .fe .S. &quot;ARK ROYAL&quot; ?. can hold this line unless outflanked inland, provided they receive food.   TheMain body of Cossacks, all fighting men, are under  &apos;      &apos;  General ShkurOj but are very short of food.   The daily mortality of men and horses is great, about 1500 sick and wounded being in improvised hospitals . II olvi, Ships have provided all possible relief. General  range1 is expected at Sochi on 23rd Aprils   General Shkuro and Georgian War M-inistar visited C-in-C on board H.M.S. &quot;AJAX&quot; on the 21st April.   The unanimous decision was arrived at that they should await the arrival of General Wrangel. It is considered that unless Crimea can continue to feed Cossacks, which is improbable, they must move to South to get food.   Shkuro is ready to help to defend Sukkum. Province if allowed;- over Georgian frontier with his Armies, or alternatively is prepared to march through Sukkum with his Armies and back to Kuban through the Mountain Passes, provided he is fed on the way.   The Georgian Minister, while expressing sympathy with the Cossacks, asserts his determination to resist Bolshevism, but declares that no armed forces could be permitted to cross the Georgian frontier.   If both sides persist in this attitude, it is pointed cut that a conflict must result, and the road will be open to the Bolshevik advance.   Without committing General V-rangol, C-in-C, Mediterranean pointed out to Georgian Minister the desirability of using the Cossack Force to resist the common enemy*   This view, which is the only one which can secure the coast road against the Bolsheviks, met with little favour *   The Admiral emphasises the fact, which has already been reported; that the Georgians are relapsing on all sides and look in vain for assistance from us or our Allies.^iPi^B Area and Trans-Caucasia.C-in-C, Mediterranean reports that General Kourushky is collecting the 32nd, 33rd, and 39th Divisions of Red Army and preparing to attack Azerbaijan.   The Reds are concentrating at Vladikavkaz, Grozni and Petrovsk in order to attack the Trans-Caucasian Republics and Balm.   The Admiral&apos;a general view after a personal survey of the situation,is that the present diplomatic methods no longer count in Trans-Caucasia.        It is pointed out that Military force alone can preserve to these Btates the de facto independence recently recognised by us and our Allies, and without this force they will suffer eclipse and Armenia be isolated and laft a prey to the lurks, the population being in due course massacred when convenient.   The G.O.C. Constantinople reports that the military opinion is that the 20 to 30,000 Cossacks retiring on Batoum are desperately determined to force through at Gagri and Sukkum, under strong Red pressure.   It appears therefore doubtful if Georgia would hold out against these desperate men.   It is there -fore likely that negotiations regarding permission to enter Georgia in exchange for military aid of Cossacks   against Bolsheviks will mature. ;-Batoum. :The Foreign Office 3nave informed Admiral de Robeck   that if the Bolshevik advance continues on the coast road Batoum Garrison will shortly be in grave peril.   The military view is that the town cannot be ho Id&quot;against powerful or sustained attack except by forces in excess of snv that Axlies could provide. On the other hand, the political consequences of withdrawal would be most unfortunate, particular 1?/ at a time when representatives of these Caucasian States are on the eve of agreement here for recognising Batoum as a free port %n Georgian territory with qualifications for all states. *A Bolshevik success at Batoum
p* 6 **374would destroy this agreement and imperil the alliance of these Republics *   It might precipitate the Bolshevik capture of Baku, and consequent loss of entire Caucasus, besides dealing a heavy blow at Armenian hopos.   The Admiral-High Commissioner is authorised that if he finds British troops in i minent danger he is to concert with General Lilne for their withdrawal, since Hti&apos;.:* Government cannot contemplate a mill tart disaster. Meanwhile the French have agreed to send a whole battalion from Thrace at once to Batoum, If it is decided to retain it, and await the Admiral&apos;s decision before sending orders for its despatch.   The Italian Government are prepared to fulfil their original promise to send a battalion if the situation can thereby be rendered secure.yiadivostook.The Japanese remain in occupation of the town and. have presented the following demands to Provisional Semstvo Government for the termination of their military occupation.(l) Russian   Armed, forces of whatever party are to be removed from certain specified areas within the vicinity of Japanese troops and 30 Kilometres on either side of Ussuri railway, Russian and. China frontier and Suchan railway.(2) A limited number of Russian soldiers will be allowed for the purpose of maintaining order in these areas.The protection of railway will be carried out as stipulated by the Inter-^llied Military in accordance with the Allied Powers Agreement.Russian Fleat.The Japanese Command have taken over temporarily all ships of the   Russian Naval Department, arms $ munitions of war and munition factories and depots.   The Russian Command have -been ordered to comply with the least possible delay, a special joint Russo-Japanese Commission being formed if necessary to put these demands into effect.ITALY.Italy has granted Austria a free zone in the port of Trieste, so that if Austria intends to build up a mercantile, marine again all her traffic will pass through that place.   (Aiis is certainly not a bad stroke of business from Italy*s point of view,The Arsenal at Saples and the Yards at Castellamare are to be clone away with as Naval establishments.The Government has sent a Commission to Venice, Trieste and Pola, to report on what should bo done regarding the naval dockyards at those places.-    GERMANY.Of the 192,000 tons of floating docks etc, to be surrendered by Germany about 50% of the material selected by Germany for surrender has either been sold already, Is unfit for use, or is at Danzig and therefore not available.The Conference of Ambassadors decided on the 15th April that the Inter-Allied Naval Commission of Control in Berlin should inform the German Government that they must replace it by other material.The reparation/

At Kiel a warrant officer proclaimed himself Commander-in-Chief, and at Mlhelmshaven a Sub-Lieutenant recently promoted from warrant rank.   It appears that the constitutional. Government at Stuttgart recognised the status of these two officials., An extraordinary situation now arises, as neither tho Allied nor the German Naval Commissions of Control can or will carry on their work in these ports.It is understood that the officers concerned tn the coup d1etat are to be tried before civil courts.    How long it will be before officers are reinstated in the Naval establish,  nts and ships at these ports who can be recognised is not known.,Allocation of ex-German Warships.^he allocation of ex^-German Vessels so far decided on is ae&quot; follows :-To Great Britain     ....
