Asmall number of men couia easily set the whole of the machines atany
f -     80**    m    *.1, place on file, as it is verj cliff ioult to guard them.   It is also preferable for the        -^oroe to protect the aerodromes themselves instead of asKin^ for *riii$&apos; protection.   It must be remembered that without machines communications will break down.   It should also be re:.nembered that some of the otations have ver;. large numbers of rnaohine guns in store and these must be protected - one station alone has 30,000 maohine guns,   Unless the Cabinet rule that there is no need to protect aeroftsmes and that responsibility for the destruction of machines will not rest on the /dr service, adequaten guards must be retained for their &quot;j rotection.Another point that I must bring forward Is,  ,hat a large number of Royal uir Jforoe reservists are untrained in the use of any arm (steps are being taken to train all men in arms in thej future) and it is Impossible to say hov* many are trained.   This is being investigated and I have arranged to notify the rVar Ofiioe. how many men trained in the use of arms there will be available for handing over after the schemes mentioned above have been provided for.   It is impossible to give any figures at present, but,in the course of another 84 hours I hope to be able to give thenumbers that will be available for the assistance of military force.I would point out that the i.ir Airce realises the seriousness of the situation and is making ever  effort to make every possibleman available for protection work.YourB sincerely,(od. ) JERDBRIOK GUlfoT.
