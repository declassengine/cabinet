Oft 1%?- k-Cabinet Memorandum  019, &quot;Representation of Employees on Boards of Management&quot;, ehould be road as a supplement to this Memorandum.
THIS DOCUHENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BR ITALIC MAJESTY&apos;S OOVIMMBNT. CP. 2824.CABINET.LUhiU I RAIS7AY BUT;. 1981.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Minister of Trans-port.The Cabinet has deoided at its seoond meeting after the Easter Reoess to disouse two items in connection with the Railway Bill whioh is to be introduced shortly into the House. The first of these is the question of men on the Boards.     This arises under the following heading in the &quot;Outline of Proposals as to the Future Organisation of Transport Undertakings in Great . Britain and Their Relation to the State&quot;, approved by the Cabinet at the time the announcement was made:-&quot;Managemsnt.Eaoh of the grouped railways will require a Board of Management, and in order to secure efficienoy and uniformity, and avoid undue cost, the number of members composing the Board should be limited to probably 21.    The composition of the Board is considered to be of the greatest importance, and whilst in the past the Direotors of Hallway Companies have all been appointed by the shareholders, the Government are of opinion that the time has arrived when the workers - both offioials and manual workers - should havo some voioe in management.&quot;Tho view of the Railway Companies is givon in the following quotation under the same heading from their letter of the 8th December last to me:-&quot;Management.The Assoo3ation are unable to aoquiesee in the proposals of the White Paper under this heading, and will strenuously oppose any suggestion that &quot;workers elected by the workers&quot; shall be appointed to the Boards.They consider that the proposal is quite unjustifiable and wrong in principle, and that from every point of view it is objectionable.Dealing with the question of discipline alone, the position created by such appointments would become intolerable, end in the opinion of the Association no servant in a subordinate position should in any circumstances be placed at any time In authority over his official ohlef in the conduct of the business of the undertaking. *
&quot;Apart,-howe-var, from&quot;this the Association believe that it is entirely wrong that the G-OTBrxraent, whilst expressly-refraining from accepting any financial responsibility, ah^uld; seek to impose upon railway undertakings proposals which radically affect the constitution of a Company and its powers of management, and which interfere with the right of share-holders to choose their own Directors.The Association recognise the possibility of advantage resulting from the association of the workers with the consideration of certain operating problems which call for solution from tine to time.Those objects would be secured by the appointment of a Committee or Committees composed of;-fa)   Officers to be nominated by the Board;fb) Workers to be elected by and from among the workers either seotionally or generally and in such proportion as may be thought advisable;(o)   A Secretary appointed by the Board.These Committees to meet under the Chairmanship of a Director to consider and make recommendations to the Board.&quot;The uncompromising opposition to the proposal is fully maintained by the Railway Companies.Dealing first with the alternative suggested, in my &quot;view such an Advisory Committee, with no power, tacked on as an excrescence to the recognised machinery of direction and manage-ment of the railways would be perfectly useless, and if the men accepted it - which I do not imagine for a moment that they would the result would be delusion and a feeling that they had been tricked.    Nothing of any importance would be sent to this Advisory Committee;   their recommendations would be treated as-worth the paper they had been written upon;   they would have no power, and being outside the reoognised channels of authority and submission for authority, the proposed organisation would die of inanition.The proposals which were put forward with the authority of the Cabinet were with the -object of first of all strengthening the Railway Boards by the addition of three members
who were to be whole-time Directors and. who had the experience gained from having devoted their life-time to problems of transportation, and by the addition of, say, six workers, elected by the workers on a railway from amongst themselves.It was thought that by so introducing workers into the inner oouncil of the railway, not only would good result from these men bringing their experience to aid in the deliberate-ations of the Board, but also that railways being a statutory undertaking, with charges fixed from time to time by the community and not being dependent upon world competition, the workers would see for themselves when the economic level was being reached and would thus be educated to ease onerous conditions of service in the interests of economy and not to press their wage claims beyond .what was reasonable for the industry to bear, or to an extent which would kill trade by high charges.     The statutory and essential characteristic of the industry, with charges fixed by the community and not by competition,appeared to be sufficient justification for differentiating between putting workers on the Boards of such undertakings and refusing workers on the Boards of ordinary commercial undertakings..The Railways, as I have said, are bitterly opposed to the suggestion and even if it were found possible to settle with them on other matters, I am told that they would decline to settle anything so long as this to them obnoxious proposal remained in being at all.I have, over the last year, had the closest consultation With trading bodies.    A great many individual traders favour the suggestion:   others favour it, but do not like the compulsion; others frankly fear the introduction of workers on these Boards as a   first step to the interference of labour in industry generally, and while admitting in argument the difference betv/een
a statutory railway undertaking, with charges fixed by the legislature, and a commercial undertaking, so dislike tho idea that they will not admit its desirability.The slureholders are of course, at the bidding of the Railway Companies, bitterly opposed to anybody but elected representatives of the proprietors being on the Boards, and wo must reckon with the railway shareholders as a powerful force of great political significance.The only really organised thoughtful body of trading opinion which I have been able to test in this matter is the Federation of British Industries.     They have gone into the proposals for the future of railways with care and assiduity. Their Committee has worked arduously at the subject.     They cannot agree to back the men being put on the Boards in words, as they were much divided on the subject, but they have suggested as a counter to It that an equal   number of traders&apos; should be put on the Boards,    This of course would meet with equally strenuous objection from the Railway Companies, and indeed it seems to me to be somewhat less justifiable than to put men on the Boards, though not altogether without justification because although the user of the railway is tho customer, he has no freedom in the choice of where he shall trade, and the old basis Of railways having to do the bost they can on the fixed statutory maxima having been departed from, he has some justification for saying that as he has to pay the piper, he ought to have a voice In calling the tune.   He may well say: &quot;You built your railway under certain statutory charging powers. For reasons with which I am not concerned, or at any rate for which I am not responsible, those statutory charging powers are now insufficient, and you want higher powers.   I have to pay them.   I am entitled to an Insight first of all into the finance of your undertaking,   for   which   I have to   provide chargingn    m
powers, and alse) I am more than ever interested in the economical  forking of your undertaking, because the more economically it is worked, and the more efficiently it ia ravaged, the greater will be the reduction from time to time in these abnormal charges which I must sanction&quot;*The men, on the other hand, can say:-   &quot;Our wages we are told are bo high that the industry cannot bear them.   We say that the industry could bear them if it were better managed; that we could help you if we understood the financial effect  of some of our demands, and if we saw whether in fact traffic was being killed by the charges which had to be put upon it. In this case it is the community who decides what charges traffic has to bear, and it is the community, which supports us or declines to support us in our wage dements&quot;.Put briefly, that is the position as regards the participation of labour in the direction of these great under-takings, and under the proposals there will be only 5 or 6 great Railway Companies in Great Britain.      So far as I know, we are under no specific pledges in this matter, and I desire guidance from the Cabinet as to what its wishes are.The second point upon which I desire instruction from the Cabinet is as to Wages and working conditions.    In the White Paper under this heading, the following is set out:-&quot;images and Working Conditions.It is proposed to provide by the Bill for a permanent machinery to deal with questions of railway wages and working cond:. on the lines of the two Boards which havo beenestablished temporarily by agreement, namely, the Central Wages Board, oouristing of equal numbers of Managers and men, with an appeal to the National Wages Board, consioting of four Managers, four men, and four users of the railway, with an impartial Chairman&quot;.
The reply of the- Railway Compaajjea, ia-as fxjdlows;-*Wages and Working Conditions.The White Paper provides for permanent machinery to deal with questions of railway wages and working conditions on the lines of the two Wages Boards, which have been established temporarily by agreement, namely, the Central Wages Board, consisting of an equal number of representatives of the manage-ment and of railwayman, with an appeal to the National Wages Board, consisting of four Railway Managers, four   representatives of railwaymen, and four representatives of users of the railways, with an independent Chairman.The Association wish to point out that such a proposal is hardly consistent with the statement made in another part of the White Paper that it is intended to hand back the railways to their owners to be managed on the basis of private enterprise, as it takes from them the power of dealing with their own men or setting up their own machinery for settling disputes.It also tends to establish as a permanent arrangement standardisation of wages and conditions of service without taking into account the different conditions that apply to different parts of the country. This, in the opinion of the Railway Companies, is wnong in principle and uneconomic In practice.The Association therefore suggest that the system of Conciliation Scheme Boards which was first introduced in 1907 and amended by a Royal Commission who sat in 1911, should be re-established subject to such modification as subsequent experience might suggest, and should become the means of arriving at a settlement of questions affecting the rates of pay and conditions of service within the various groups.Although the members of the Clerical Staff were not parties teD the Conciliation Scheme, there would appear to be no objection to some similar scheme being set up on their behalf&quot;.The great clash of opinion here is, as in the Coalfields, between the national and district settlement.    The men want a National Board, with national rates of wages, and the Companies want district Boards.    There is, however, this great difference between the coalminers and the railwaymen:   the Unions are national Unions on the railways, and district Unions on the coalfields.    Railwaymen move from place to place.   A driver running from Leeds to Edinburgh would meet in Edinburgh a driver who has worked from Perth into Edinburgh, and so would a Guard, and so would an Attendant.   A signalman, too, would be moved from one place to another, and they would find themselves always
meeting people working under othor conditions of service. This was the cause of much discontent on railways before the War.    In L*eda, where there are many Companies, there were thousands of men on identical work under possibly half a dozen or more varying sets of conditions and wages, sometimes working in the same station, simply because they belonged to different Companies, and wherever the districts meet, there will be trouble.The Railways wish to go back to the system in th3 good old days when each Railway dealt with Its own employees on a semi-feudal system, and we must remember that immediately before the War moat of tho Railways had not gone sufficiently far to meet the Unions at all.    On tho 16th August there will be no machinery for settling any of these disputes.    The old Conciliation schemes, which applied to each Company, are gonej the present system of settling wages and working conditions is makeshift and cumbersome, and in any event only applies until the end of the Government guarantee.Tho proposal of the Railway Companies1 Association is not acceptable to the men because it departs from the national settlement basis.    The Railway Companies are making no effort to-day to deal directly with their men and try to arrive at a settlement.    They have asked me whether I would invite them to meet the men.I propose, subject to the directions of the Cabinet to provide in the Bill for a continuation for six months or a year of the present National and Central Wages Board machinery, and to prov5.de that during a brief period the Railways and the men shall be free to settle these jnatters by conference among themselves, and that at the end of that period, fulling a settlement, a Railway Commission shall be set up to hold public enquiry and formulate a scheme for the purpose of
12th April, 1921.regulating these matters in the future.    I think that the railways would accept this as tho best in the circumstances, although of course what they desire lc to have district machinery set up before the guarantee expires and get wages reduced on a district basis by the Government during the continruanc-e. of ;he guarantee, so that any ijnduairiaJi &amp;4AKUfotoQQ&amp; might be met by the- Govej^nmeort guarajvtoer -and not by the Companies-1 ^wn funds.     This, for obvious&apos; rea&amp;ms,-is a course which it ia musi: undesirable to adopt, as apart from.--the financial I03S, it would be. putting the ^niojas is an unfair position that the public purse should be used for financing them on a question of machinery of this kind.I desire instructions from the Cabinet as to whether they approve of the lines which I propose to take.(Signed)   ERIC GEDDES.
