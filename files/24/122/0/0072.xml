SlTlUfYoT Iff isgDSFPoT&quot; -(Si SS^fc?A fo. ?Ae. J,Q-cr-e-^-:ry of State for War).1. (MBAAL MILITARY .SITUATION.The number of minor outrages shows no diminution, &quot;but there iB still an absence of rebel activities on a large scale, and the general situation remains unchanged.*In Dublin the principal feature of the week has been the oapture of arms.   These captures, following those of last week, are the result of information as to the existence of hidden arms.In the country, the only operations of any magnitude were the rounding-up of armed rebels drilling at Ballymurphy, Co. Carlo;?, in which five rebels were killed and ei;jht captured; and an attack on ration wagons at Clogheen, Co. Tipperary, in which a Hotchkiss Gun on a farm cart was captured from the rebels.Several police barracks have been attacked, both in the vicinity cf Dublin and in the country, but none of these attacks has been pressed home.The rebels appear to be concentrating their efforts on out-rages on a smaller scale, such as the shooting    of horses, the cutting of roads, and the sniping of individual members of the Crown Porces and murder of loyalists.This policy of avoiding risk was the usual rebel method until the formation of the Flying Columns and Active Service Units. The inauguration of these units led to more active operations, involving large numbers of rebels and considerable risk to their lives.   In the Martial Law Area, at ariyrate, this semblance of Military operations has for the time disappeared, and it may be assumed that the policy has not met with the succesc which had been hoped for by the I.R.A. leaderu, or that the rank and file do not consider their achievements justify the risk involved.The An T&apos;Oglac is now published weekly instead of fortnightly as has previously been the case.   This is significant j,n view of the known reliance which I.K.A. Headquarters place upon the influence of this paper on the moral of the Volunteers,   Recent numbers havo shown an increased incitement to murder, and to small outrages as compared with larger activities.   The article which dictates this policy is hardly consistent with the haad-ing of the leading article in the previous number which was entitled &quot;All or Nothing.&quot;The 0.0.C. 6th Division has recently submitted to me a review of the Situation in the Martial Law Area and of the progress made by the methods adopted.   In considering this question it must be borne in mind that the Area in which Martial Law was imposed contained the counties in which the rebels had made most headway and that the situation there was rapidly becoming worse. The degree of success attained must, therefore, be viewed in the light of the probable state of affairs which would have existed in Munster to-day had Hartial Law not been imposed.
The principal point8 brought out in the report of the G.O.C. Martial Law Area are as follows(a) The intense rebel activities on a scale previoualy not attempted, which marvel the De,-in.iin;; of the Martial Law period, have died do-vr., and for a month there has been comparative immunity from such operations.   This is probably due to re-action after ill-success, the desire of some men to get back and attend to their farms, and,possibly, instruction to keep quiet till after the olections,(b) Rumours, apparently well-founded, as to inten ed attacks on isolated garrisions in Kerry and elsewhere, have come to nothing, although it is believed that the preliminary con-concentrations of rebels took place.(o) Individual murders of Protestant Land Owners and Farmers and other moderate people are numerous, and are probably due to an attempt to frighten inhabitants from Giving information. The murders increase as the larger outrages decrease, and it is thought that they are the work of members of Flying Columns in their spare time.   These murders of individuals are particularly, difficult to prevent,(d) Information has not been coming in so well recently. This ic due partly to the increased wariness of the rebels in their movements - previously they moved about freely in confidence that their movements would not be reported by inhabitants.   In Cork City, however, information has in-creased since the murder of unarmed soldiers.(e) Interning has Undoubtedly done good.(f) The attitude of the Press in the Martial Law Area has much improved, thanks to firm control, and also probably to the recognition Of the faot that intimidation does not now have such a free hand as before.(g) Inconvenience is no doubt caused to the population by Martial Law restrictions, and certain   sej/tions of the inhabitants are apt to attribute the cause for these restric-tions entirely to the Troops and Police.(h) Generally speaking, Martial Law has justified itself and the rebels have been driven back to their old position of small outrages involving little risk.   Two courses appear to be open to the rebels for future action.   To organise strong surprise attacks; but the rebels will probably be in no better position to do this in the future than they are now.   Or, to play a &quot;Waiting game&quot; in the hope that we may be worn down by the cumulative effect of minor outrages and that political propaganda will supplant military operations.I am in agreement with these views of the G.O.C. Martial Law Area, and I have no hesitation in saying that our policy, not only in the Martial Law Area, but all over Ireland, must be to be ready to strike when intelligence is received and to enforce restriction rigorously in order to bring home to moderate men and neutrals alike, that the forces of the Crown are gaining control of the Military situation.Ugd.)
