This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.SECRET.CP. 2821.THE CABINET.THE   SITUATION  OP   THE   BRITISH  FORCES   IN  and around CONSTANTINOPLE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate a memorandum.by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.I am of opinion that we should press upon the French the necessity of unity of command at Constantinople under Lieut.-General Sir C. Harington, presenting to them as the alternative the necessity of withdrawing the British troops from Constantinople altogether.L. W.-E.The War Office,April, 1921.1. From time to time the General Staff have drawn attention to the dangerous situation, in which our forces in and around Constantinople might be placed, in the event of failure tc come to terms with the Turkish Nationalists.In a recent paper they expressed doubts as to the prospects of success held out by the projected Greek operations, and feared that they might injuriously affect the security of the Allied troops in the neighbourhood of Constantinople.2. The course of the Greek operations, now becoming known, goes to show that the General Staff understated rather than exaggerated the probabilities of failure. As a result of the failure of the operations, it appears to be the intention of the Greeks to remove the 11th (Manissa) Division to the Brusa front, thus uncovering the Ismid Peninsula. Nationalist bands have already made their appearance in the latter area, and General Harington reports that a great increase of hostile activity is probable if the 11th Division goes south. But whether this Division remains or not, it is clear that the moral of the Greek Army, already not too high, will sink still further, and that it will be unsafe to place any further reliance on it. General Harington has been given discretion to withdraw west of the Bosphorus, but in this event he anticipates the appearance of hostile artillery on the east shores of the Bosphorus, which would be a great annoyance, if nothing worse.In addition, it is highly probable that recent events may at any time bring to a head the many causes of unrest latent in Constantinople itself, whilst the danger from General Wrangel&apos;s forces cannot be neglected.I have only dealt with the forces near Constantinople, but if the Greek Army dissolves, the situation of the British troops at Chanak will be precarious.3. In these circumstances I would press most strongly that not a moment should be lost in securing unity of command, which has become an urgent military necessity. Further, I would suggest that the time has come when the Government must make a definite decision as to which of the following, alternatives should be adopted, viz. : (a.) Send reinforcements tq Constantinople ; (b.) Withdraw the existing British troops ; or, (c.) Readjust the Allied policy.Of these alternatives, (a) is impossible at the moment, whilst the Greek failure is likely to have added to the difficulties of (c). On,military grounds, therefore, I should prefer (6).HENRY WILSON, Field-Marshal,Chief of the Imperial General Staff.6th April, 1921.(B21/148)   100  4/21   HAS, Ltd.   9084wo . ,
