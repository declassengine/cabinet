DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERHMKRT) C R E Tt2863. C A B I II 5 T.MSTHQD3 OF EXERTING NAVAL PRESSURE UPON GERKANY.TOQRiUjDUM BY THE ADMIRALTY.(Ref. Cabinet 24(21), Conclusion^ 5).1. tJhls is the only effective measure open to navalPorcest2, If a Blockade should be declared, a completesurveillance of the German North Sea and Baltic coasts could be achieved by the employment of moderate British Forces, in view of the present weak state of the German Navy, and non-existence of submarines, v/hich would enable a close blockade to be maintained.3. It is presumed, however, that a complete blockade,equivalent to an act of war, would not be contemplated, as it might embroil us with the &quot;Jilted States and other countries not participating in our action.     (N.B. A separate note on the legal aspect of this question is attached hereto. See Appendix.)NAVAL OCCUPATION OF HAK3URG AND BREMEN. 4. These towns lie at distances of 70 and 68 milesrespectively from the mouths of the Rivers Elbe and Weser. 5, Although before the war big liners could proceedto Hamburg at a draught of 25&apos; 6&quot;, the maximum draught now possible, owing to lack of dredging, is 24r.    This is quite inadequate for Battleships, which draw over 30 feet, 6, The situation at Bremen is similar and thelargest size of war vessels that could proceed to either of these places would be light cruisers v/hich would have
an insignificant number of men available for landing parties. 7. If the maintenance of a peaceable attitude byGermany can be guaranteed, there would be no naval objection to sending lirht cruisers to these ports, but under these conditions it is difficult to see what would be gained by so doing, except as a moral support to the officials superintending the collection of customs. 8. If, on the other hand, the attitude of germany is in doubt, it would be taking an unjustifiable risk to send warships up the rivers unless the safety of their passage through the narrow waters, and on arrival at their destination, wes ensured by military occupation of the forts and river banks.     There would also be a risk of the ships becoming imprisoned if the channels should be Hocked behind them.9. The entrances to both rivers are within short range of powerful artillery, mounted as coast defences, which Germany was permittee1 to retain under the Treaty of Versailles, and the rivers themselves are so narrow and tortuous that the ships would be subject to attack by field artillery if the German Government were hostile. 10. Their position on reaching their destinationwould also be unfavourable, as the practicability of effective action by naval gunfire in such narrow waters would be extremely limited.11. If, on the other hand, a military occupationshould be decided upon, it could only be effected by the Army, and the value of warships at these inland harbours would be confined to acting as 1 points d!appui! for the military forces.
12. In the view of the Admiralty, therefore, theoccupation of Hamburg and Bremen by HaTal forces is no a practicable operation.(Intd)    L of ?Admiralty S.W. April 21st, 1921.
EBQAJi   ASPECT OP A EOSglSU.: BLOC-FADE.The normal blockade is blockade imposed upon a belligerent. . There have however been cases of blockade beingimoosed in tiue of peaoe.     Such blockades have in differ-ent oases been applied:-(a) Only to the ships of the nation blockaded;(b) To all ships entering and loaving the port blockaded.&apos;3. There is considerable doubt as to the legitimacyof any form of pacifio blookade, but international lawyers generally are prepared to ad;.it the validity of pacifio blockade of type (a).    Pacific blookados of type (b),. where ships of all nations are stopped, are such more doubtful, and we havo recently refused to admit the validity of the Italian blookade of tho port of Plume In 1902 Germany and Great Britain gave notice of a blockade of Venezuela of this type but it is believed that noeffeative action was ever taken. 4. In order to be legal any blockade has to be effective in the sense that the blockading ships must be sufficient to render most probable the capture of vessels to which tho blookade a-plies.    It will be seen from the accompanying memorandum that there will be no difficulty in making a blookade effective in this sense.In the present oase a blookade of type (a) is of course worthless as the trade in German ships is negligible.
