[Tills Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1921.SECRET.THE SITUATION IN EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Sultan having expressed a wish to see me in audience, and Lord Allenby advising that I should go, I accompanied him to the Ahdin Palace this morning.The Sultan said that he had long wished to speak to a Cabinet Minister, as he felt that the Egyptian situation was not properly understood by the British Government. How could they understand it when they had all the affairs of the world as well as of their own country on their shoulders ? He complained that he was never consulted until things went wrong, and it then took a long time to get them right again. He could not understand why imperative orders should be sent from home hastening matters on without allowing people on the spot, like himself, to judge to some extent the time and method of action. I asked His Highness to give me an illustration of what he had in mind. In reply he said that, whereas the country was quite quiet three or (our weeks ago and settling down very tranquilly, it had now all been disturbed again by the imperious wish of the British Government to have a delegation on the Milner Report. His countrymen were orientals, who rarely pursued the same object for long, and if they had been left alone there would have been a continued improvement in the Egyptian situation. Now, however, for the last three weeks, things had been getting steadily worse; excitement was rising, and there might easily be trouble and serious disorders, undoing all the appeasement of the last six months. He then went on to say that the British Government were woefully misinformed of the influence and strength of Adly Pasha. His influence was very limited. He was the leader of a small group who had their headquarters at the Mohammed Ali Club, and most of whom had received office in the new Ministry. He did not believe he had any strong elements of support in the country behind him. Moreover, Adly was not a man of courage or combativeness, and he believed he was already shaking in his shoes at what lay before him, with Zagloul on the one hand and the British Government on the other. He could not understand why it was we had forced a change of Ministry and insisted on reviving the whole Milner Report question again. Why not leave the initiative in these matters to the men on the spot to himself and Lord Allenby, with whom he was in complete accord ? Those two would know much better than statesmen in London how to handle the Egyptian situation and retrieve the false position into w?hich the country had been plunged by the Milner Report and its premature publication last August. He supposed that the reason was that the British Parliament forced this action on the Government.I explained to His Highness that this was not so; that the Conservative constitu-tion of the present House of Commons would make it very averse from many of the provisions of the Milner Report, and that, so far from there being any pressure on the Government in the direction of Milnerism, Parliament might very easily manifest a strong opinion to the contrary. So far as the Cabinet was concerned, we had been placed in a false situation by the premature publication of the Milner Report. It might be a false situation; but we were obliged to recognise that it was a new one; and since then we had been endeavouring to act in a sincere manner to the Egyptian people with a view to meeting, as far as possible, their legitimate aspirations. However, I said the British Government would certainly insist on important reservations, and I thought it was quite possible that no agreement would be reached. The Sultan said he was certain that no agreement would be reached, that the delegation would demand absolute impossibilities, and that when these were refused they would return to Egypt to create trouble. It was not possible to meet their wishes in full, and nothing less than the full satisfaction would be accepted. The extremists were in control of this movement, and even if a moderate delegation signed [6073]
an agreement on moderate terms in England, they would be repudiated when they got out here.I asked His Highness what he thought would follow the breakdown of such negotiations, and he replied that undoubtedly there would be trouble, but that the right course in that event would be for the British Government to state absolutely what it was prepared to give in the way of liberal reforms; to govern with a firm hand, using martial law and having sufficient troops on the spot, and then to carry into effect under these conditions the principal measures of reform we intended to give. Do this bit by bit without ostentation for six or seven months and watch the effect of each concession very carefully, so that at the end of that period we should be able to say : &quot; We have done all that we undertook to do. We are not talking about it: it is actually done. That is all, and there is no more to come. That is how matters stand for the present.&quot; His Highness was very insistent upon the need of a policy or &quot; programme,&quot; he called it, from the British Government. &quot; Programme and confidence,&quot; he repeated several times, &quot; were the watchwords. Let the Government tell me and the High Commissioner what they want done, and let them give us a fair chance to carry it out in our own way. How could the British Government, or individual Members of Parliament who had been a few months in Egypt during the war as young soldiers, understand Egyptian politics as well as he, who, as Prince Fuad, had lived in the middle of it all for twenty years and knew all the personalities and intrigues ?&quot;He evidently thought that his task had been rendered much more difficult by the recent handling of this question from London. It was not possible for him to say to his countrymen : &quot; Remain slaves; cease to agitate for liberty.&quot; On the other hand, he regarded the demands put forward as absolutely impossible. He seemed greatly to regret the advent of the Adly Ministry, which he anticipated would either collapse or be dominated completely by the extremists.Altogether the Sultan made a good impression upon me. His views about men and affairs were expressed with much pith and point, and his description of the practical difficulties in which he was placed by the Milner-Zagloul agitation would impress anyone who heard it. I am quite sure that if he had been able to make to the Cabinet the statement which he made to me my colleagues would have been very much impressed. This movement in Egypt at the present time is very largely run by the Pasha class, who have accumulated enormous wealth without being in any way subject to taxation on modern lines. They are now ambitious of getting the whole country in their hands and re-establishing a reactionary regime. These men are of course well known personally to the Sultan, and I expect he is capable of forming a very shrewd opinion of them.It is quite impossible to stay even a short time in Egypt without feeling how gravely bur interests have been prejudiced by the Milner Report, and by the lack of any policy in regard to it, into which we have been forced by its premature exposure. The agitation is fed on false hopes from day to day, and the belief grows in their breasts that they have only to push hard and keep on pushing for the British Government to surrender to their demands. As I have no doubt whatever that we shall not surrender to their demands, it is clear that a very unpleasant and abrupt shock lies ahead ; and certainly we shall have ourselves created a greater part of the difficulties with which we are confrontedw. s. c.March 22, 1921.................- -----,.............. - .        -----.....&apos; 7 ! h -      &apos;t&apos;r^t,.; - &quot;^fw W*
