Mr. Longhurst

This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.

Referred to Committee of Home Affairs

SUMMER TIME BILL.

Memorandum by the Home Secretary for circulation to the Cabinet.

CONFIDENTIAL

The Summer Time Act of 1916 gave power to make annual Orders in Council as to Summer Time "during the continuance of the present war". By the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act of 1920 this power was extended for a period of one year after the termination of the present war. If the war is terminated this year, the present emergency powers will lapse next year, and it is desirable therefore, if possible, to pass permanent legislation this Session. I circulate a draft Bill herewith for the approval of the Cabinet.

It will be remembered that the question was fully investigated by a Departmental Committee in 1916. In their Report (Cd. 8487) they strongly recommended the continuance of Summer Time and there can be no doubt that there is an overwhelming preponderance of public opinion in favour of it.
