Geddes (Washington)April 25th, 1921.D,   April 25th, 1921.K,   11.15.a.m. April 26th. 1921. No, 262.      (R), Urgent,German reparation proposals were received at State Department this afternoon at 4.30, Following is text, begins:&quot;April 24th.  ll,0,p,m.    United states Government have by their note of April 22nd. opened possibility, in a way which is thankfully acknowledged, of solving reparation problem once more by negotiations ere a solution is made possible by coercive measures. German Government appreciates this step in its full im-portance.    They have in following proposals endeavoured to offer that which according to their convictions represents the utmost limit which Germany&apos;s economic (? group omtd..) even under most favourable developments can bear.1.    Germany expresses her readiness to acknow-ledge for reparation purposes a total liability of 50 billion gold marks (present value),Germany is also prepared to pay equivalent of this sum in annuities adapted to her economic capacity, total of 200 billion gold marks.Germany
Germany proposes to mobilize her liability in following way.2.    Germany to raise at once an international loan of which amount, rate of interest and amortiza^ tion quota are to he agreed oil    Germany will parti-participate in this loan, and its terms in order to secure greatest possible success will contain special con-cessions and generally be made as favourable as pos-slble.    Proceeds of this loan to be placed at dispos-al of the Allies.3.    On the amount of her liability not covered by international loan Germany is prepared to pay interest and an amortization quota in-accordance with her economic capacity.    At present juncture she considers rate of 4% highest possible.?4. Germany is prepared to let the powers concerned have the benefit of Improvements in her economic and financial situation.    For this purpose amortization quota should be made variable.    In case an improve-merit should take place quota would rise whilst it would correspondingly fall if development should be in the other direction.    For regulations of this variance an index scheme would have to be prepared.5.    To accelerate redemption of balance Germany is ready to assist with all her resources at recori-struction of devastated territories.    She considers reconstruction most pressing part of reparation because it is the most effective way to combat hatred and misery created by the war.    She is prepared toundertake
undertake herself, the rebuilding of townships, villages and hamlets, or to assist in reconstruction with labour, material and her other resources in any way Allies may desire,,    Cost of such labour and material she would pay herself (full details about this matter have been communicated to reparation commission),6.    Apart from any reconstruction work Germany is prepared to supply for the same purpose, to state concerned, any other materials and to render them any other services as far as possible on a purely commercial basis.7.    To prove the sincerity of her intention to make reparation at once, and in an unmistakable way Germany is prepared to place immediately at the dis-posal of the reparation commission the amount of one billion gold marks in following&apos;manner:Firstly, 150,000,000 gold marks in gold, silver and foreign bills;Secondly, 850,000,000 gold marks in treasury bills to be redeemed, within a period not exceeding three months by foreign bills and other foreign values.8.    Germany is further prepared, if United States and the Allies should so desire, to assume part of indebtedness of the Allies to United States as far as her economic capacity will allow her.9.    In respects of the way the German expend!-tures
expenditures for reparation purposes should he creditedlift -     : :    - : &apos; .    . : . .&apos;        &apos;&apos;, . &apos;.v   &apos; 1 &apos;y   :. - - :     - . - &apos; &apos;.against her total liability, Germany proposes that prices and values should he fixed by a commission of expert s%10.    Germany is prepared to secure subscribers of loan in every possible way by assigning to them public properties or public income in a way to be arranged for,11.    By acceptance of these proposals all other German liabilities on reparation account are cancelled and German private property abroad released.12.    Germany considers that her proposals can only be realised if system of sanctions is done away with at once;    present basis of German production is...... .not further diminished;   and if German nation is again admitted to the world&apos;s commerce and freed of all un-productlve expenditure.These proposals shall testify to German firm will to make good damage caused by the war up to the limit of her economic capacity.    The amounts offered as well as mode of payment depend on this capacity.  &apos; As far as differences of opinion as to this capacity exist, German Government recommend to have them examined by a commission of recognized experts agreeable to all parties concerned (gr. undec.) (? which they) hereby declare to accept, as should United States Government consider negotiations could be facilitated by giving proposals another form, German Government would bethankful
thankful if their attention were drawn to points in which United States Government consider an alteration desirable.    German Government would also readily re-ceive any other proposals United States Government might feel inclined to make.German Government is too firmly convinced that peace and welfare of the world depends on prompt, just and fair solution of the reparation problem not to do everything in their power to put United States in a position which enables them to bring matter to the attention of the allied governments.

(D)My immediately preceding telegram.Since receiving (? text) of German Reparations proposals I have seen Secretary of State who informs me (? that, omitted) his desire is to help the Allies exclusively.He is anxious to know if it would he agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Government if he were to transmit German proposals to them and he has informally asked me to let him know if I am prepared to receive them.    Have replied to the effect that I cannot answer until I have had time for consideration but that it would appe to me that if on examination they are found by him not to contain a proper basis for discussion it would be better that I should not be asked by him to receive them,Seoretary of State is very anxious not to do any-thing likely to cause difficulty for the Allies and will, I have no doubt, be entirely guided by His Maj esty1s Go vernment in the matter ,I await instructions which I hope will be sent at the earliest possible moment.
-   398POLITICALUNITED STATES 0? AMERICADecypher.    Sir A.Geddes, (Washington),25th April 1921.D. 25th April 1921.R.   12.15.p.m.   26th April .1921.NO.264.My two preceding telegrams.I received the text of German proposals informally from State Department in part from Secretary of State, and in part from Under Secretary of State.I saw Secretary first alone, then withdrew to consult with my French colleague who had not seen him and then saw Secretary again in company with Monsieur Jusserrand.Mr.Hughes is very anxious to be helpful in this matter and spoke very plainly to French Ambassador saying that he hoped the psychological moment for securing maximum reparation payments from Germany would not he missed.    He expressed his confidence that France did not desire to destroy Germany,    He added he was not in a position to judge whether psychological moment had arrived hut hinted that if it were agreeable to Allies America might join with them in an expert economic commission to determine amounts Germany should pay and has paid.Throughout his remarks Mr.Hughes insisted on his sole desire to help the Allies.I have little doubt that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment
Government and French Government wish anything in reason definitely conveyed to Germany Mr. Hughes can he persuaded to convey it without apparent reference to Allies but taking: advantage of this opening afforded by the penultimate paragraph of German note.Mr.Hughes is now in my opinion in such a position at home that it will be very weakening to him and damaging to the administration if interchange of notes simply lapses without some result.    Sentiment of American public appears to be in favour of strong action by their Government and is not inclined to support any effort to secure easy terms for Germany.
