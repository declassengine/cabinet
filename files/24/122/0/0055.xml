S S 0 R E It Copy so.C.P.-2B55.0 *ABIHE!Mo to by theBeo^o t a ry of :j :-n te for the Colonies (Re f o rar,o o C a&quot;b laa t 24 (21), Cone lus 1 o n 6.)I wish to put on record my reason for agreeing to the Fronoh occupation of tho RiUir, viz:-    It will happen anyhow. We cannot stop it even if wo nado an open &quot;breach with FrancOt Therefore it is better to acquiesce in their action while trying to obtain the mitigations proposed by the Prime Minister. On no account should we Gurselvas be involved.     The consequences of the whole policy of reparations on the absurd scale with which the French public are still being deluded will load to a tremendous economic disaster in Europe and to the concentration of all German thought and energy upon a war of revenge.(Initialled)    WvS*C.50L0HIAL OFFICE, S.V/.1, April 81st, 1921.
