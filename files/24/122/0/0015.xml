[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmefft. 1I HAD four interviews with the Emir Abdullah in Jerusalem.  His attitude was moderate, friendly and statesmanlike. His visit excited considerable demonstra-tion of Arab enthusiasm taking a distinctly anti-Zionist character.  He maintained an absolutely correct attitude, reproved the demonstrators, stated that the British were his friends, and that the British Government would keep their promises to Jews and Arabs alike.  The general drift of our policy had already been explained to him by Colonel Lawrence, who has his complete confidence.   I gave him my proposals, already communicated to my colleagues, for constituting Trans-Jordania an Arab province of Palestine under an Arab Governor appointed by the High Commissioner in consultation with himself. He hesitated over this and finally asked that it should be referred to his father and to his brother Feisal, the remnant of whose governorate the province was. He then advanced as his own idea of the best solution the appointment of an Arab Emir for Palestine and Trans-Jordania bear-ing the same relation to the British High Commissioner as would be determined for Mesopotamia.  This, he thought, was the best way to allay the growing alarm of the Moslems at the Zionist movement.   I explained that such a solution was incompatible with our mandate.   He said he was not making demands, but only giving advice as a friend.  He then offered to carry on in Trans-Jordania as at present while his father was being informed.   I thought something more definite and lasting must be arranged.   At our third meeting, therefore, I proposed a temporary arrangement to last for probably six months, the period covering the candidature of Feisal in Mesopotamia.   This arrangement is informal.   Abdulla would govern as at present but with the assistance of a chief political officer from us, British officers for his local levies, and British advances of cash to pay the levies now three months in arrear. No British troops will be sent at this stage. Abdulla will establish the three aerodromes required by the Air Forces and he and the local levies will be constantly visited and supported by the air squadron from Ludd. Chief of the Air Staff has been requested to give the necessary directions from the Air Ministry.  Meanwhile, action is proceeding.  Abdulla has now returned to Amman to begin work for us.As regards the French, I have made him fully aware of the importance to himself and his family of maintaining a correct attitude towards them. He has promised to exert every effort to keep peace on the borders. He has sent orders to the desert tribes to refrain from raiding their enemies in the French zone, and he will hold the Syrian exiles in check. I have agreed to try to get them, or some of them, an amnesty from the French, as they are necessarily a disturbing element.I also had a long and not unsatisfactory interview with M. de Caix. He began by pressing strongly for the despatch of &quot;British troops to Trans-Jordania, and conplained that we were not discharging our responsibilities in that region. In reply, I spoke very plainly to him about the unfortunate effects of French policy upon our Arab problem, and I told him that he was generally reputed to be extremely hostile to the British. He denied this, and declared that he had only recently forbade French officers to start intrigues against us in our zone. I explained to him the arrangement I was making with Abdulla about Trans-Jordania, and told him that the keystone of it was the prevention of attacks upon the French. He accepted the arrangement without objection of any kind, though he regretted British troops were not being sent as well. Subsequently, in conversation with Sir.Herbert Samuel, he said he was glad the arrangement with Abdulla would not be a formal one, as at the moment that might offend French opinion; but that if Abdulla was able to maintain order &quot; all would be forgotten and forgiven in six months.&quot;  There is noPrinted for the Cabinet.

doubt that the French have already been trying to get in touch with Abdulla them-selves. On the whole, I was well satisfied with the attitude of M. de Caix.It is no use pretending that this plan will be as satisfactory as the sending of the force originally specified, but it will cost very little and we run no risk of an entangle-ment. I have therefore felt it right to give full weight to the misgivings which the Cabinet had expressed. It is probable that at a later stage troops will be needed, but by then the position will have become much more stable and they can perhaps be found from Palestine without reinforcement. AbduhVs own position will be a difficult one. He was everywhere accepted as a deliverer who had come up to attack the French in Syria, and to protect the Moslems of Palestine from the Zionists. Instead of this he has definitely undertaken to be our friend. Whether he will have the same power for good as he had for evil cannot yet be seen. His change of front was due to the explanations which were given hin\ of our general policy towards the Shereefians, both in regard to Iraq and the Hedjaz, and also no doubt to his hope of an ultimate reconciliation with the French. If the matter had not been treated in this general way, no local agreement would have been possible, and a very disturbed situation would quickly have arisen.The principal cause of unrest in Trans-Jordania is the number of exiled Syrians who are roaming about in distress seeking vengeance on the French, M. de Caix told me that General Gouraud was thinking of announcing an amnesty following on a new programme of reform in Syria. I told him we were doing the same in Mesopotamia, and if possible the announcements will be synchronised. Meanwhile, Abdulla will make lists of Syrians who are on his hands in Trans-Jordania, and these will be sent to the French in order that each case may be dealt with on its merits and the number of homeless men will be diminished.W.
