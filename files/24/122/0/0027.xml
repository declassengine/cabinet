circulated by the secretary of state for india.SECRET.op 07       !)Proposed Bill to validate Divorces granted to Europeans in India.The President, of the Divorce Court has recently decided in the case of Keyes v, Keyes tliat the High Courts in India have not jurisdiction under the Indian Divorce Act, 1800, to pass decrees dissolving-marriages between Christians who are not in a legal sense &quot;domiciled&quot; in India.It is known that the Indian High Courts have in many ca^es during the last 50 years passed decrees for dissolution of marriage between persons not technically domiciled in India, and that re-marriages have been con-tracted on the faith of the validity of such decrees. The jurisdiction of the Indian High Courts in this matter has been upheld by the opinion of Sir Henry Maim1 and Professor Dicey, and had not, before the case cited above, been called in question in the English Divorce Court. The effect of the recent decision is to invalidate the divorces so granted, and the rc-marriages contracted on the faith of their validity, and to illegitimatise the children of these unions.The only remedy for the hardship and distress caused by this purely legal decision is legislation in the Imperial Parliament. Even if it were practicable for the Secretary of State for India in Council to institute, or desirable for him to support, proceedings with a view to reverse the present decision in a higher Court, (his course would, only lead to delay and might very probably prove unsuccessful in the result.I therefore ask authority for the introduction in the House of Lords at. the earliest opportunity of a Dill to validate the divorces and the re-marriages in question. The Dill would not propose to authorise the Indian Courts to exercise the disputed jurisdiction in future. It would clearly bo uncontroversial.Tho Bill is now in preparation and will be circulated as soon as possible.E, S. M.11th April 1921.3759     100  4.21
