S, M,20th April 1921.Extract front holslieeih ucwspiqicr Bednota, Moscow, dated &apos;Mth november 1920.English newspapers are full of impatient expectation as to when will trade commence with Soviet Russia. Traders and commercial hom-.es are heaping the Government with questions in regard to this. Why such hurry? First reason--defeat of the last White Guard forces by the Red Army. Second reason-pressure of English workmen. Another reason is that they are afraid that the revolution will spread from Uussia to England s rich dominions in Asia. By a peaceful agreement the English capitalists hope to stop the Soviet Governments agitation in Asia. Make haste Messrs. Bourgeois: to-day you are still in power, hut, who will guarantee that in a short time we will not he buying peace from you, but will conclude a brotherly union with the English Soviet Government.Extract from the Bairaq-i-Adalat, published by the 1st Army Political Department,dated 7th November 1920.(This is an extraordinary number of the paper published on the 3rd anniversary of the declaration of Soviet Republic in Russia.)li On auspicious occasion of the 3rd anniversary of the Great Revolution.&quot;Oil, Muslim Brethren ! Open your eyes and look round. Think of the conditions under which Muslims are living. Think of your countries Persia and Afghanistan, as well as of your Muslim Brethren in Turkey, India, Egypt, Arabia, Tripoli, Tunis, &amp;c, and examine the situation carefully. In whose hands are these Islamic countries, and who is administering them ? England, France, and Italy. See how they are oppressing the populations of these countries.What is the position of the Calaphate V In whose possession is Constantinople ? See how the religious places of Sultan Mohamed the Conqueror, Sultan Bayazeed and Sultan Ahmed have been turned into churches for the use of the British. See how they intend putting up the cross over the minarets in place of the crescent.Supporters of the religion of Islam and sons and children of Ottomans are being daily imprisoned by hundreds and thousands. Every day those who take up the cause of the Muslim womanhood and endeavour to. maintain the honour of virgin girls and save them from the grip of British officers, are being done away with and thrown over into the sea.3814    100 4.21

We shall never forget the treatment and the cxcesse3 committed by Russian Cossacks on -Persians prior to the Revolution. Our hearts are still bleeding in memory of those ravages.
