This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestyfs Government.CONFIDENTIAL.RELATIVE RANK OF OFFICERS OF THE NAVY. ARMY AND AIR FORCE.AIR MINISTRY MEMORANDUM FOR THIS CABINET.The Air Council agree in the view of the Admiralty that the position in regard to relative rank of offloors of the N&amp;vy, Army and A^r Foroe is unsatisfactory.2,       Tho suggestion in the Admiralty memorandum C.P.2805 that recent action on tho part of the Air Force has contributed to the difficulty cannot, however, he aooepted. So far as officers of the Air Force are concerned, when their titles wore tho same as for the Army they had by law a vested right to the same relative rank,&apos;   when their titles were changed by King!s Command to those which now obtain their position as regards relative rank was still seoured to them by king order.    It cannot be admitted that this involved any fresh claim,    What is however tnue is that the similarity of title between Captain R*N* and Group Captain R.A.F*, and between Commander RCN. and w&apos;ing*-*ComiHander, R.-A.P., brings out in a way unacceptable tc the Admiralty the difficulties which have long existed as regards the relative rank of Captain and Commander R.N. compared with Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army.30       The specific points dealt with in the Admiralty memorandum are really an issue between the Admiralty and the Army Council, the Air Force not being concerned except in so far as vested rights are affocte&amp;.340       It is assumed however that the Admiralty proposal that an &quot;impartial arbitrator of Cabinet rank should consider the whole question&quot; refers not merely to the rolative rank of Captains and Commanders R.N. but to the relative rank of all officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force0    This appears to be necessary, because while the Admiralty desire to put forward a grievance as regards Captains and Commanders R.N., the Air Foroe (and the Army also) are able to point to some striking anomalies in the lower part of the scaleo    For instance, a Lieutenant in the Army or Flying Officer in the R.A.F. ranks with a Sublieutenant in the Navy;   but whereas the Army or Air Force officer oan attain&quot;the age of 30 years within this rank, the Sub-Lieutenant R.N. rarely exceeds the age of 22 or 23.&apos;5.       On the assumption that the whole soale will be considered, and that the Air Foroe will be given a full opportunity of participating in the enquiry, I^should desire to support the proposal of the First Lord of tffie Admiralty to appoint a Cabinet Minister to consider the whole question.Air Ministry, F.E,G.27th April, 1921.
