7I!fIS DP^^^T I?- T1IS PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S BRITANNICCABINET *Forth J^evon Light Rally ay. Wota by the Minlater of Labour.S3CRST. CP.2849. vrtien the schemes for Light Railways in North Devonand South i/ales, supported by the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment&apos;s recommendation for financial assistance, were considered by the Cabinet on the 24th March&apos;, a decision was postponed, and in the meantime I was given discretion to ascertain whether the promoters of the Railways could raise a larger proportion of tho cost locally.     I circulate herewith a copy of a letter which I sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 14th April, detailing the steps taken with regard to the North Devon Light Railway, together with a suggestion which was put to me as a way out of the difficulty.     I shall be glad if this matter can receive very early consideration by the Cabinet, in view cf tho great local Interest in the North Devon scheme as a means of relieving unemployment, and the necessity of riving an early reply to those who have Interested themselves in it.(Initialled)   T.J.M.Ministry cf Labour.
212.D.5583/X920,14th April, 1921,My dear Home,You will, no doubt, remember that when my memorandum (C.U.141) dated 4 th it arch, regarding Schemes for light Railways in North Devon and South wales, supported by a recommendation from the Cabinet Committee on Unemploymentfor financial assistance, came before the Cabinet on the 24thMarch, the question was discussed but no decision was reached.It was felt that it &quot;would be necessary for the local interests to subscribe more money towards the schemes before theGovernment could reasonably be expected to make a grant.     Itwas accordingly decided -&quot;(a) To adjourn both questions until the newChancellor of the Exchequer, to be appointed shortly, had had an opportunity to re-examine then.(b) That the Minister of Labour should have discretion to ascertain whether the promoters of the two schemes for Light Railways could put forward a more attractive proposal from the point of view of the Treasury.&quot;This afternoon I have had a meeting with a deputation representing the various bodies interested in the promotion of the Worth Devon scheme and have discussed the whole position with them without, of course, giving any guarantee that, even if more money was raised locally, Government assistance would necessarily be forthcoming./SomeThe Rt.Hon. Sir R.S.Horne, G.B.E., K.C., k.P., H.ivi. Treasury, S. v/ * 1 *A
213Some time a-o, it was estimated that this scheme would cost  327,000.     It is now, however, represented to me that this figure is too high, and that the scheme could probably be completed for  260,000*I pointed cut to the deputation that up to the moment local interests had held out the hope of raising only  100,000 and. that unless this contribution could be raised very substantially, there was no hope of the Government beln/? able to make up any difference.In the course of discussion I e plained that on their revised estimate of  &apos;.:60,000, and assuming that the Wages Bill was approxiinately 50^ cf the total cost, i.e.  120,000, the most that a Local Authority, Interested in a scheme of this kind, would be able to get from Lord St. David&apos;s Committee would be 60^ cf the latter figure, 1,6.  76*000;   and that on these rough comparisons, it seemed clear that unless the local interests could make out a case for more favourable treatment than a Local Authority rt*ould receive from Lord St. David&apos;s Committee, (which it would be very difficult to do), the local interests would have-to raise something in the neighbourhood of an additional  100,000 before the Government could reasonably be expected to consider the question of coming in and supporting the scheme.I gathered from the manner in which this intimation &quot;tv&amp;s received that it would be nc easy matter for the locality to raise this additional sum, and it seemed to me that part of this difficulty .vas due to the disappearance, in premotion fees and expenses, of the entire sum cf  50.000 which was raised for a similar purpose a number of years ago.It it38, therefore, rather strongly urged that in order to help the local interests in the effort which they would make to raise the additional money, they should be authorised to announce that in the event of the locality being/ able
214able to raise another  100,000, cr such further sum, as, together -.,Ith the Government grant, would be sufficient to secure the completion of the scheme, the Government would be prepared to make a grant towards the cost of the scheme of  80,000.In vi.e* of the unemployment position which is undoubtedly serious in Plymouth, Exeter, and Earnstaple, (the towns which would most benefit from the work in connection with the construction of this railway) I was strongly urged tc obtain the necessary authority for such an announcement to be made without delay.I undertook to let the parties know the decision on this proposal at the earliest possible moment, and to bring the matter to your personal notice Immediately,     I should be very glad,therefore, if you ..ould be so good as to give it very early consideration, and let me know ycur view.I have written in similar terms to Mr. Chamberlain. Very faithfully your^ (Sgd)   T. J. liaonamara,
