PROPOSED ENQUIRY INTO INDUSTRIAL UNREST.

NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.

SECRET.

P. ?

I circulate herewith a memorandum which has been prepared by my advisers on the subject of a proposal made by Lord Robert Cecil that there should be a Commission of Inquiry into Industrial Unrest.

The advantages of such an Inquiry seem to be :-

(1) It might serve to show that wages adjustments are being made not because there is "concerted action" by employers but because circumstances beyond the control of employers render reductions in cost of production inevitable.

(2) It might lead to a discussion and elucidation of some general wages principles, e.g. that wages ought to fall more slowly than the cost of living, so as to ensure an improvement in the relative standard of living of workpeople.

(3) It might recommend (as did the Whitley Committee in 1917-18) resort to arbitration where employers and employed fail to agree.

(4) It would show to what a large extent negotiations are in progress in most industries by means cf various forms of joint machinery.

The disadvantages of an Inquiry seem to be:-

(1) Negotiations which are now going on in many trades about wages adjustments might be hampered because the Trade Unions would feel impelled to try to use the Inquiry as a means of delaying settlement or a means to bring pressure to bear upon employers to grant more favourable terms.

(2) Labour would concentrate upon Unemployment and would attempt again to press for an Inquiry into &quot;oauses&quot;; they would raise again the issues disoussed in Parliament last year and again this year and press for still more favourable measures in relief of Unemployment and Distress,(3) Attempts would he made to discuss matters which are political rather than industrial, e,g, the abolition of the oapltalistio system, the repeal of the Trado Disputes Aot, etc, and   any &quot;mixed&quot; Commission would bo bound to disagree upon suoh matters,(4) The Inquiry would be used as a vehicle for the disoussion of tho various Labour Party manifestcs and for further attacks upon the government for their alleged failure to oarry out the reoommenda-tions of the National Industrial Conference whioh met m the early part of 1919,(Signed)   I.

PROPOSED INQUIRY INTO INDUSTRIAL UNREST.On the 21st instant Lor\ Robert Cecil and Sir H. Foreman a3kod the following questions:-&quot;Whether the Prime Minister will recommend the appointment cf a small R:yal Ccmmisalon to report upon the main causes cf industrial un-rest as shown In the recent disputes on the railways, in the coal trade, and in many other departments of British Industry?&quot; \&quot;Whether the Government has made any inquiries since the publication cf the Report of the Committee on the Relations of jEmployers and Bnployed into the best, aud latest means of minimising the industrial troubles from which the nation is suffering?&quot;The Prime Minister gave the following reply;-&quot;Seme form of systematic enquiry into the in-duatrial unrest may be desirable.    The Qovern-meht are considering the question, but I do not think the appointment cf a Royal Commission would be the best means of eliciting information on this important subject.&quot;In answer to a supplementary Question, the Prime Minister indicated that he had in mind the Commission of Inquiry into Industrial Unrest which was appointed in the early part of 1917.    The present memorandum deals with some points which, it is thought; ought to be borne in mind in giving further consideration to the proposal to appoint a Commission new.It may be noted that for some months past the number of strikes in existence in this country has steadily diminished;   thus, while In August last there were at any given moment about 120 strikes In progress,/the
the number ha3 steadily diminished until at the present time there are only about 50 anA the majority of these affect very small numbers of workpeople. Immediately after the Armistice the Government intimated to employers and Trade Unions that its Policy wtuld be to encourage industries to settle their affairs for themselves with a minimum of Govern-ment interference and the result of this, combined with the working of joint negotiating bodies (such as Conciliation Boards, Joint Industrial Councils, Trade Beards, etc.) has been to ensure a vast amount of consultation between employers1 associations and trade unions on matters affecting the several industries consultation whioh, notwithstanding a certain pro-portion of inevitable failures, has resulted in a large measure of mutual agreement.Apart from the conciliation arrangements that exist in the large industries of the country (engineering, shipbuilding, building, iron and steel eto.,) there are 70 Joint Industrial Councils and 61 Trade Boards, each covering about $4 millions rf work-people, as well as the Agricultural Wages Boards whioh deal with agricultural labour.    These Con* dilation Boards, Joint Industrial Councils and Trade Boards provide a measure of joint discussion whioh far exceeds anything previously experienced;   every week the meetings of Joint bodies of these kinds number hundreds.The two main causes *f such &quot;unrest&quot; as exists at the present time are, of course, obvious to everybody - Unemployment and Wages Reductions.
thoroughly gone into during the disoussionswhich took place last year in the House of Commons and again this year in the same place on the proposals put forward for Unemployment Insurance, and the revised legislation is so reoent, that it does not seem probable that any useful purpose would be served by now reopening the question, more especially having regard to the dislocation of industry which is bound to result from the ooal strike.   It will be remembered that at Christmas an attempt was made to secure the oo-operation of the employers and the Labour Party in an Inquiry into Unemployment, but the proposal was dropped in view of failure to satisfy the Labour Party as to tho scope of the proposed Inquiry.6. So far as regards Wages Reductions, in his supple-mentary reply, the Prime Minister rejected the idea that there might be an inquiry into Wages;   he indicated that &quot;the question of wages is much better settled between employer and workman&quot;,   m faot, there has been for some months past a very large amount of discussion between employers and employed on the subject of wages adjustments, and in many important trades settlements have been reaohed or negotiations are in progress.7. It will be apparent, however, that any Inquiryat present would neoessarily have to devote a great deal of attention to the question of wages.   There is, for instance.a suspicion that there is &quot;concerted action&quot; by employers gener-ally to reduce wages.   An inquiry, while it could not prove ordisprove the allegation about &quot;concerted action&quot;, might show that the causes of wage reductions are really outside the/control
control (and largely outside the influence) of employers, and to this extent the Inquiry might do good.On the other hand the prohabilitles are that some Trade Unions now faced with reductions would make the Inquiry a reason for further delay.   Thero is evidence that the fall in the cost of living and the slump in Trade generally are having their effects on the minds of the Trade Union leaders and also on those of the workmen.   The minority, who are the most noisy, represent these reductions as a transference of monoy from the workman to the employer, bujfc the average workman knows differently, and whilst he is prepared to receive any benefit that resistance may give hi^r when the test comes he will follow the advice of the leaders to whom for years he has been aooustomed to look for guidano^.An Inquiry might do good by ^providing for a discussion and elucidation of the broad principles underlying wages adjustments, e.g. that, though money wages must necessarily be reduced, they should (unless the conditions of tho industry are so overwhelmingly bad that no other course is possible) bo reduced more slowly than the fall in the cost of living, so that readjustments of wages ensure a higher standard of comfort than that which existed before the war. But what suits one trade will not suit all, and any recommendations about wages principles would have to be in very broad and general terms, and, while they might afford a certain amount of debating material, they would not very much affect the real question at issuo at any particular series of negotiations (o.g. whether wages in the chemical trade shouldbo reduced 2d por hour or l^d).If the Government announce that they propose to/hold
hold an Inquiry into Industrial Unrest, it may be anticipated that the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress will seek to extend the Inquiry to cover &quot;fundamental causes&quot;, e.g. the distribution of profits, &quot;control of industry&quot;, etc   The employers, too, if they took part in the enquiry, would probably want to include an investigation into output and into &quot;ca canny&quot; as well as an examination of the effects of Trade Unionism, the^Trade Disputes Act, eto.An Inquiry into what are called &quot;fundamental causes&quot; would develop into an examination of the structure of society. A Commission of the ordinary kind, including, as it must, leading employers and leading labour men, could not reach agreement upon such a proposition as the abolition of the capitalistlo system and Its replacement by, say, Guild Socialism; nor could the Commission agree that management and labour should between them share the control of industry,   Equally the members of the Commission would not be likely to reach agreement upon proposals to abolish Trade Unions or to repeal the Trade Disputes Act.The experience of the rVhitley Committee appointed at the end of 1916 is of interest in this connection.   Theterm3 of reference were:-.(1) To make and to consider suggestions for securing a permanent improvement In the relations between employers and workmen.(2) To recommend means for securing that industrial conditions affecting the relations between employers and workmen shall be systematically reviewed by those concerned, with a view to improving conditions in the future.No terms of reference could be wider than these andthere were few subjects *which the whitloy Committee did notconsider during the two years of its existence; but in the/end
end It was found impossible to make any reoommendations which in themselves attempted to deal with &quot;causes&quot; of unrest. 13. An Inquiry at the present time might, of course,(as did the v/hitley Committee) arrive at an agreed reoommenda-tion favoring resort tc arbitration, and it would doubtless call for a better spirit in industry and for closer co-operation between employers and employed.   But this really would get us very little further.   Arbitration during the war was compulsory and there was a good deal of it; arbitration in peaoe time must (as before the war) be put forward just when, and only when, the parties can be brought to agree to it.   The conciliation work which the Ministry of Labour is already doing, leading as it does on suitable occasions to settlement by arbitration, constitutes as much formal State intervention as the parties to industry are at the present time disposed to accept.   If more is needed in any particular dispute, a Court of Inquiry can be set up, aa waa done in the cases of the Dockers1 dispute and the recent national Tramways dispute.14. As for specific schemes to avoid Unrest (co-partnership, profit-sharing, etc) an Inquiry at the present time would doubtless come to the same conclusion as did the Whitley Committee, namely, that such matters cannot profitably be dealt with In general but must be considered by the employers and employed in the industry concerned through its appropriate joint machinery.15. All that an Inquiry would appear to be likely to do would be to resolve into formal language what those who Hudy the position know, namely, that ae a result of the war the economic conditions of industry are so changed and are now. so disturbed that the process of re-adjustment is bound to oreate/situations
situations of difficulty -but the difficulties are largely transitory and to search for specific &quot;causes&quot; at the present time is unlikely to prove fruitful of good result.   v;hat in needed is a general recovery of industry and a concentration of effort on the part of employer&quot;; and employed to secure a steady and enlarged output, at prices sufficiently lo1? to secure a market.   It seems doubtful whether this process would be assisted by the existence of an Inquiry into &quot;causes&quot;.It will be appreciated that the Inquiry, if held, would tend to become political in character.   Assuming that the miners&apos; strike is still the subject of discussion, the Commission might be tempted to try to include coal mining within the scope of the Inquiry.   Moreover, there will shortly commence a discussion about labour on the railways and the Commission could not very well avoid calling attention to such a question as this.In both instances the subject has certain political aspects and no doubt the labour member&apos;-: of the Commission would make the most of their opportunities accordingly.Moreover, the labour representatives would press for a discussion of the Labour ?arty election manifesto, the Trade Union Memorandum on the &quot;causes and remedies for Labour Unrest&quot; put forward after the national Industrial Conference in  February, 1919, and the Labour Party proposals regarding Unemployment submitted early this year,   And they would doubtless use the  -opportunity to point again to the &quot;failure&quot; of the Government to adopt the recommendations of the National Industrial Conference,/On
On the whole/ the considerations indicated above seem to lead to the conclusion that the appointment of a Commission now is not desirable.   The Commission appointed In 1917 served a useful purpose as a safety valve and as such it did good work;   the conditions today are quite different *   In the last two years good progress has been made in the direction of leaving Employers and Trade Unions to discuss and settle their difficulties and it does not appear that this progress would be accelerated by the intrusion of a Commission of the kind suggested by Lord Robert Cecil.Ministry of Labour. 28th April, 1921.
