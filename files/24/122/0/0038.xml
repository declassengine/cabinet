It is not, however, at all likely that the strike will be general except perhaps for a few hours.Efforts are being made by tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the extremists to promote a general strike: the London Distriot Council of the Electrioal Trades Union is prepared tc ast, but an adequate voluntary service can be maintained.Among railwaymen and transport workers there is little onthusiasm for a strike, but a large percentage always obeys the leaders.Should the Trinle Alliance strike, there is grave risk of sabotage by extremists.
The miners as a whole have been orderly and aro still solid; in Fifeshire they have raided signal boxes at Thornton Junction and pilfering has occurred in several areas.The Communists are abnormally active in the coalfields and intend to infiltrate the Defence Units; fraterni-vc^lon with the tro&apos;:ps is urged and leaflets intended to undermine &quot;discipline aro in circulation.Tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; Intends to issue a special revolution]] edition cn the first day of the Triple Allienoe strike.The British Bureau of the Rod International of Trade Unions has received  4S0CD from Moscow:   &quot;Solidarity&quot; receives a weekly subsidy of more than  70 from tho Bi:rc?u,   The money may have bt^en given before the Trado Agreement was signed.A raid on c Glasgow communist has&apos; resulted In the seisure . of a quantity of&quot;ammunition and explosive. ,
(Egg,,CO^;]CTTOAs a result of an interview between the Government ana the Railwaymen and Transport Workers, negotiations between the owners ana miners were re-opened on April 11th. The Federation had previously issued orders to the effect that there should be no interference with the work necessary to preserve the mines.    Pumping has therefore been resumed and the majority of mines have been saved.A series of meetings on April 11th and 18th ended in the refusal of the miners to accept proposals put forward by the Government, which included district rates, to be settled by national negotiation, end State financial* *aid, during a short period, for the hardest hit district, but rejected the demand for a national pool.On April 13th tho Executive of the Railwayman and Transport Workers, having conferred with the miners the previous evening, ordered their members to strike on Friday, April 15th, at 10 p.m.    This morning, April 14th, they again interviewed the Government but at the timo of writing there have been no developments.As indicated in my last report the miners1 strike is largely political in aim in that it was engineered by Eocleston Square.    Corroborative information has been received from France that the strike was really planned for a later date but that the extremists in tho Labour Party precipitated action when the approach of de-control was announced.    There has been feverish activity at Eocleston Square during the week, but it is now doubted whether a general strike would be successful owing,to mobilication.jwiellish/
- g -Mellish went so far as to suggest the use of violence to stop the formation of Defence Units.     The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; staff ha been the link &quot;between Sccleston Square end the Columnist Party and although the contact between this party and Sinn Fein is not close, it is belieied that both organisations have issued orders for the infiltration of their members into the B$fence Units.    It i3 reported that 2,000 Glasgow Sinn Fciners have been detailed for this service and that 800 communists and Sinn Peinero in South V/ales have been given similar orders.The vast majority of the general public firmly supports tho Government but recurring industrial crises have given rise to tho belief that the&apos;present 3triko, like its predecessors, will bo settled without a social upheaval: this opinion has deterred ma-ay thousands from joining the Defence Units.   At the same time the effect of extremist propaganda is seen in the attitude of working &apos;olass reservists who while obeying their calling-up orders, have shown unmi stakeable sympathy with the miners.   Another significant feature of the situation hi the fraternisation order given by the more able revolutionary loaders to their followers.The Midlands Division of the national Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers lias issued a circular in which members.are urged not to assist actively any party or organisation but,in the event of trouble to form pickets under the command of&apos; their own officials and maintain order in the interests and defence of their homes and relatives.   Members are informed that whilo they are not concerned with the present dispute, they are concerned with the country!s welfare and that it is their duty &quot;to keep the crowd back&quot; from the Government, owners, and unions who are &quot;in the ring.&quot;The disorders in the Scottish and Welsh coalfields have been substantially as reported in the Press and can be tracedin/
in practically every case to the influence of tho Unofficial Reform Movement.   In the Lothians three communist minors, one of thorn an official, have been arrested in connection with disturbances and it is of interest to note that the Fife Miners&apos; Association has decided to affiliate with the Rod International of Trade Unions.   In South Wulos revolutionary activities have been directed from Tonypandy and Blasn Rhondda. Tho prime mover in A.J. Cook:   &amp;s agent ^ov Rhondda No. 1 distriot and a member of the executive of the national federation ho carries exceptional weight.   His activities are best expressed- in a letter to tho recent national conference of the Unofficial Workers&apos; Committees at Shoffield in which ho said that he was working for the revolution in spite of the fact ihat he was an official of the Federation.In all the coalfields the organisers of the unofficial movement havo been working incessantly.   As an instance it may bo mentioned that a comparatively unimportant &quot;rebel&quot; applied &quot;for two or throe thousand leaflets on the minors&apos; dispute&quot; for personal distribution in the Liverpool area. These leaflets, which were issued by the headquarters of the &quot;Workers1&apos; Committees, ha^e been distributed broadcast throughout the country.   Another corununist in Wigan stated that he had sixty dozen copies of the &quot;Communist&quot; for &quot;sale.&quot;It was decided at the Sheffield Conference that as the reductions under the owners1 offer were less in Yorkshire than in any other large coalfield an intensive propaganda campaign should be organised:   this was started in Castle ford by a delegate from Wales named Roman! Pritchard.   He and a gang of extremists went round the West Riding and secured by intimidation the withdrawal of the men who were pumping. Pritchard has now returned to Wales&quot; and his own account of his activities,&apos; though exaggerated, is not uninteresting:5  &quot;Last/ &apos;
&quot;Last Thursday morning- wo had a meeting in the Market Place and held the attention of one of tho largest crowds ever seen there...At ni&amp;bt an even bigger crowd turned-up and we fairly gingered them up.,,1 1,500 of them marched with its to. the railway station, a distance of fully a mile and a half.   En route they sang the &apos;Red Flag&apos;...and at the station they promised that not one scab should be allowed to continue at any of the surrounding collieries...They cheered like Hell for the revolution and it was interesting to note that a tremendous number of them were carrying hoavy cudgole and sticks.&quot;On April 9th a secret conference of the North of England section of the Red International of Trade Unions was held at Newcastle in connection with the mining crisis.   About 100 delegates, including miners, railwayman and transport workers attended and a strong&apos; attack was made on moderate trade union leaders, particularly tho local officials.   George Harvey, wh is the North Eastern organiser of the Red   International of Trade Unions, declares that &quot;the fakirs have passed the word to the 1 Herald1 to boycott us.   They refused to publish our reply after giving the fakirs a show.   Our lads are wild at the 1 Herald&apos;s&quot; behaviour.&quot;   Harvey has accordingly sent an &quot;Open Letter to Durham Minors&quot; to &quot;Solidarity&quot; and has offerej to take 5,000 copies of the paper if it is published; his comment on the present situation is important In view of his intimate acquaintance with the North-Eastern coalfields.   &quot;The miners are done for.   The wires have been pulled.   A ballot on revised,but catchy terms, would be accepted.   The men are feeling the pinch next week.   But, if we go down again, it will help us in the end.&quot;My correspondent has secured a copy of the national rules of the Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Movement:   these are a good illustration of the attack on trade unionism by the Red International by the process of &quot;boring from within.&quot;Organisation&quot;That .this organisation of the Unofficial Movement shall be composed of members who are active members of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.   As a general rule the units of this organisation shall correspond to the already existing units of which the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain is, or shall be formed..   &quot;Districts/
&quot;Districts should correspond to tho corresponding existing districts inside the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain&quot;(--.t present) owing to the moment being inopportune to set up or fix lines of demarcation.For purposes of Co-ordination&quot;District secretaries shall be supplied with names and addresses of all the District Secretaries. Each district seoretary to send reports onoe a month to General Secretary of the &quot;Miners&apos; Section&apos; of the National Workers1 Committee Movement, whose duty it will be to collate the reports from the districts, and to issue to the districts a monthly repor of all tho districts.&quot;In the event of any development which necessitates speedy action the district first cognisant of the dovelopmen to send such report to all district secretaries, also to general secretary.   Action to bo taken on such reports.&quot;BAII/.;ATO5N AI1D TRANSPORT workers the past week has boon one. of alternating hope and despair for tho revolutionaries, whose position on the executives has been much weakened by the opposition to strike action among the rank and file.   A majority of railwaymen and a large percentage of transport workers are of opinion that they should not be called out without a ballot;   they believe that if the miners are &quot;beaten&quot;, it will be their turn next but would prefer to express their sympathy in terms of financial assistance.The following are extracts from a circular issued by-Bobert Williams to the officials of unions affiliated to theTransport Workers1 Federation on April 9th:&quot;I am directed by the Executive Council to ask you . &apos;     as representing one or more sections of transport workers to prepare for every strike eventuality which may arise. No dispute of the magnitude of the one \;hich faces us now can be &quot;run in a slip-shod or ill-organised manner.   It will require all the directive and co-ordinating ability of every responsible official and member of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation and of the Triple Alliance to organise our forces in such a manner a3 to ensure a successful result to the issue if and when that issue is joined between the Railway Workers and the Transport Workers as well as the Miners who are already involved.   There must be no hesitancy, no disloyalty .   We are entitled to expect from the members of tho Federation all thatdisplay/
display of co-operation which the railwaymen gave to their Executive when the call came for action in September 1919.&quot;Transport V*orker3, the Executive Council are convinced, will display as much discipline as Railwaymen.   Where it is uossible, strike Committees must be arranged in connection with the railway workers and mine workers in any area where these bodies work and aro grouped together.   The Government, as the Prime Minister has indicated in the House of Commons, will 3top at nothing to destroy the power of trade unionism and the advantages secured and maintained by collective bargaining and the solidarity displayed by our members.&quot;If the telegrams are despatched calling for action at midnight on Tue3day, April lEth, we are not sure that the authorities will allow them to be dolivcrcd.   You may look forward to Labour Proclamation which will be as necessary for the workers as Government Proclamations are deemed necessary for the propertied classes.   The press may bo rigorously concored, and it may be essential to ask for that co-operation of tho printing trades operatives to ensure that the information we want to convey is not held up by a decree of the Government.   The rDaily Herald&apos; will be co-operate in publishing official statements issued by the Federation and the Triple Alliance, and members will be safe in belying upon such official declarations as may bear tho signature of myself and the President of the Federation, or of tho officials of the Triple Alliance, as being accurate and roliable.&quot;The Federation will naturally expect you to devote yourselves to creating and improvising such organisation as may be required to conduct the strike to a satisfactory issue, and I am asked to impress upon you that you should at once arrange Mass Meetings, Demonstrations, organise joint committees, strike committees, etc., in conjunction with ether affiliated unions and with our Allies in the Triple Alliance, in order first of all to create and maintain the best form of organisation possible and to ensure that in a real class conflict between the propertied interests and the wc rJe in&amp;&apos; c las s the workers shall come out of,the Ordoal with their Unions strengthened and the economic position of the working class safeguarded against these &quot;bitter and unscrupulous attempts to throw us back to the position from which we had emerged after more tht.n half a century of consistent effort.&quot;It is to be understood that in the case of Unions having a mixed membership, the strike order is for the present to apply to the Transport members only.&quot;THE OOmUMISTSThe leaders of the Communist Party have conducted intensive propaganda in the coalfields by means of speakersand/
and leaflets and efforts are also being made to gain a footing in the defence Units.   The underlying idea is to obtain possession of arms, and if possible to secure information regarding organisation.   It was pointed out by a speaker at the International Socialist Club to communists and members of the Industrial V-orkers of the World that if they joined as volunteers they could perform useful acts of sabotage.   They could v/ork wonders by putting a handful of sand into machinery, dropping a match in a warehouse or paraffin in milk churns. The members agreed to sign on under assumed names but intend to carry   their Industrial Workers of the World cards in case they are molested by pickets to whom they propose to explain their mission.   It is reported that in case of a Triple Alliance strike tho communists would endeavour to adopt Sinn Fein tactics in such a way a3 to make it impossible for transport and government lorries to proceed.It is reported, on the authority of a single informant, that a number of communists in South Wales have already joined up.Communist speakers are urging fraternisation with the troops and a leaflet which is given as an appendix to this report is being prepared for distribution.   The authorship is not as yet determined, but from internal evidence&apos;there is close connection with the Rod Officers Course which figured in the Malone case.A leaflet headed &quot;Union Jack or Red Flag - What is a!TerrierT&quot; has also been distributed in,large quantities inWellington;   the imprint has been cut off but enquiriesregarding the origin of tho leaflet are in progress,.   Thefollowing is an extract:tTV,\hy should you get into khaki, become fit, learn to shoot and jab, in the defence of that very Capitalism that degrades you?   With what intelligence your masters credit you.   And look how ora:c&apos;tily they tempt you into their service.   They appeal to your dislike of a humdrum existence, to your lack of healthy recreation, to your &apos;  &apos;    ,&apos; thwarted/
thwarted desires for a change of scenery and open-air, to your love of comraderie.   &quot;Keep fit I&quot; they say,   V;hy? Do they desire you to he a man, and a breeder of men?   Not they.   Some day, v&amp;en the time is ripe, there will again be bloody trenches &apos;to let1 which your rulers are too cunning to man.   And that is where YOU come in...They want to pit you against a similar tool elsewhere.   One day there will be a strike which you may be mobilised to break.   You will be set to picket a mine, factory or railway.   Or in a tank you may lumber through an English town spitting fire and death into a crowd of your own class.   If ordered you must fire upon your father or brothers.   What moro cowardly or traitorous act is possible towards comrades fighting for industrial or social betterment?   The only body of real &quot;territorials1 is in Russia.   They ARE 1 territorials1; for they own their territory; they are not dupes ftho fight for others..,These Soviet Territorials are In arms, not because of tawdy advertisements, of toadying to employers, or of the empty glamour of soldiering.   They fight to protect the Workers&apos; Revolution against the Capitalist knaves of the world, and to show workers everywhere that, organised and determined, their Class is Invincible.   What Territorials!&quot;The communist branches have now tabled amendments to the Draft Rules and Constitution of the party mentioned in my report Ho. 94:   the outstanding feature is the dictatorial attitude of headquarters which has marked at least 75$ of the amendments &quot;Executive dissents.&quot;   It seems likely that at the Manchester Conference the Executive will exercise its &quot;iron discipline&quot; and override any suggestions which the mere members have the temerity to make.There is evidence that the chairman, Arthur McManus, is all powerful  within the inner ring aid branches have been plainly told that they must vote for him and not for William Gallacher as   chairman of the Party.   It was indicated by Kehrhahn in an unguarded moment that McManus holds the strings of the movement in his hands and is working upon a constructive revolutionary policy which his colleagues consider o&apos;f great importance.   Extraordinary secrecy is observed by headquarters and an elaborate system of shadow officials has been put into operation in order to render a raid on King Street abortive. The same methods are employed by local branches.The Communist Party has given instructions that all communist members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union are to vote for McManus as representative of the union at the forthcoming annual conference of the Labour Party.During./
During the week-end extreme speeches have been made at communist meetings throughout the provinces;   most of tho speakers while propagating revolutionary doctrine contrived to avoid direct incitement owing to their foar of the Snergency Powers Act.John McLean and his followers, howevor, have given way to unrestrained violence:   on April 10th McLean told an audience of about 3,500 on Glasgow Green that the opening rounds of the revolution had commenced and he could assure them if they maintained a proper attitude that is neither insulting or assaulting&apos; the police or military, they would be sure to win. To prepare for the change which was coming, he advocated the formation of committees everywhere.   Industrial Committees, Education Committees, Workers&apos; Committees and Unemployed Committees were necessary to take the ruling power from the hands of the capitalists.   All these committees must be subject to a central committee, of which McLean would be the president, and from which thoy must take their orders. The unemployod must carry out picketing&apos; in conjunction with men on strike, and that picketing must be done so that no man can work.   They must all work together, strikers, unemployed, and those in jobs, to see that a general strike did take plc.ee as a preliminary to overthrowing the present iniquitous system.On the afternoon of April 10th extremists attempted to hold a meeting on the esplanade at Greenock, permission for which had been refused by the magistrates,   notwithstanding the prohibition, the men started the meeting by singing the &quot;Red Flag&quot;, whereupon the police present proceeded to arrest the ringleaders.   People present numbered some thousands, but the great majority were there to see what would happen.   About six men were arrested during a struggle in which attempts weremade /
made to throw the police into the 30a.   Mounted policefinally dispersed the crowd and those attracted by curiositysoon melted away.The present serious situation in the industrial world isGlasgowbeing eagerly exploited by the/communists.   Sabotage is discussed and instances euotedof what took place during a large railway strike in the United States a few years ago. It seems likely that the rebel trade union groups will shortly come under the leadership of J.S. Clarke of &quot;The Worker&quot;, whoso influence is gradually increasing in various sections of the movement.   He will endeavour to link up all unofficial bodies in this area so as to make of them an efficient fighting force of the extreme left wing.The Glasgow Communist Group which has consistently attacked the Communist Party of Great Britain has now applied to that body for financial assistance until^Aldred is released:   the Party is reported to have forwarded the sum of  200 as a loan, free of interest, to be repaid in quarterly instalments.   New branches are to be formed with the money but the Glasgow group has been greatly disorganised by Aldred&apos;!s arrest.THH RED INTERNATIONAL OP TRAPS unions on March 26th a meeting of the Provisional International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions was held in Moscow .at which J.T. Murphy and N. Watkyn (shop stewards&apos; delegate) were present.   It v/as decided that Canada was to be organised by the Afcurioan section of tho movement, but that propaganda in Australia, Now Zealand and South Africa should&apos; be controlled by the British Bureau, which would also be responsible, with the assistance of the Bureau at Tashkent, ,  for revolutionary industrial activity in India,   Some difficulty arose over finance and the council decided that &quot;the four thousand pounds already sent forward should cover the entiro expenditure, of the next two- months,&quot;   Thistightening/
*   159, f, ctightening of Moscow1 s purso-strings is already being felt in this country for the accounts&apos; department of &quot;Solidarity!-&apos; is complaining bitterly that it is at &quot;a serious disadvantage financially&quot; and unable to meet its liabilities because it has this week received from tho Financial Controller of the British Bureau only  70 &quot;instead of the usual figure.&quot;UraCPIOYlOTUnemployment continues to inorease and the stoppage in the ooal industry will greatly aggravate the situations-Lancashire and Cheshire constitute an important example of the growth of unemployment.   The total number of men on the &quot;live1 register was 142,074, an increase of 10,711 on the previous week.   The Increase o^women on the &apos;3.ive&apos; register was 4,366, making a   total of 85,270.   The fallowing are the figures for men on the &apos;iive&apos; registerBarrow............. 2,169Birkenhead.........5,559Blackburn .......... 7,595Bolton ............. 2,950Bootle ............. 7,934Burnley ............ 2,449Liverpool..........5.8,499M-vnchester .........10,152Oldham............. 1,573Openshaw........... 6,266Preston............ 6,338Rochdale........... 2,414Sal ford ............ 6,221Warring ton......... 3,145Wigan............... 1,941Benefits were claimed during&apos; the week by 212,687 totallyunemployed and by 398,937 short time workers, making a totalof 611,624, the net increase being 6,232.   On April 6th over9,000 attendee&quot; at the St. Anne Street Employment Exchange,Liverpool, either to register or receive the unemployment donation.   Tiey included a large number of men who, havingexhausted their allowance as ex-soldiers, now come under thegeneral unemployment donation scheme,   T^e men formed up as early/
early as eight in the morning, hut the worst time was in the afternoon, v/hen the usual orderly queue became &quot;broken up.   % continual waiting made the men impatient and at one time it looked as though there might he disorder;   traffic was heldu for a time, hut a strong force of Polio - arrived and succeeds in reforming tho men in a queue.   A* scheme has now been drcum up which will obviate the necessity of men bavin&quot;: to wait-long periods; each man is to bo given a fixed time for attend at the I&amp;ichango.   This scheme ha3 met with tho hearty approval of the men as for come time now they urged that something si be done to prevent them waiting at the exchanges.In Manchester and Liverpool unemployment is gradually increasing; trade generally is slack and the largo number of unemployed is having its effect on the shops and warehouses i the shape of greatly reduced turnover.   In Liverpool, tho joiners&apos; strike still continues, and there appear to bo no steps taken to bring the dispute to an end.   Meanwhile, a&amp;l tho ships requiring repairs are either laid up in dock or sei to some Continental port.   The strikers themselves are to a great extent employed on housing schemes.   Several large fin in this district have already stated that in the event of Wa$ coal orisis continuing they will have to close their works v/, in a few days, but a3 in most cases they have been gradually reducing their number of employees for some time tho actual closing down will not make a great difference.Before the coal crisis there was a slight change for thi! better in the cotton trade; a number of mills which have be stopped, for long periods have now re-started.   Apart from minor signs of improvement in ma,^towns there was a growing feeling: that the cotton trade slump is over, and that a slow but sure improvement mi;;ht be looked for.In the Midlands tho coal crisis has already affectedemployment/
employment; in North Staffordshire various pottery works have closed and the Stanton and other blast furnaces have damped down; necessitating the discharge of a large number of workers.Six members of the Leicester Unemployed Workers1 Committee divided the sum of  21 during March and disbursed only  4 in 19 cases of distress, although tho money had been publioly oolleoted.   The sales of the &quot;Leicester. Unemployed Bulletin&quot; rose from 1,500&apos; at the first issue, to 20,000 in March, but have now begun to drop.My correspondent reports&apos;&apos;that ugly rushes, with which, however, the police have been able to cope, have been made on the Labour Exchanges in Glasgow.On April 12th a national conference of unemployed organisations representing in the main tho &quot;unemployables&quot; was held at the International Socialist Club.   About 100 delegates from London and the provinces attended and resolutions were passed demanding work or full maintenance for the wholly or martially unemployed at trade union ratos, immediate operation of the trading agreement with Russia with a view to relieving unemployment and tho recognition of the Soviet government. After a long discussion it was decided, in view of the present &quot;financial position, not to set up a National Administrative Council.THE NATIONAL WORKERS1 CO IMITTJij U0V5M5NTFrom i secret report of the Sheffield Conference to which I referred last week, it is clear that progress was made towards the unification of the unofficial movement in all industries.   The following delegates wero elected members of the Provisional National Administrative Council:Chairman/
ChairmanJ.R. CampbellSecretaryT. Kime(   W.J.C. Kirker (Miners)ScotlandNorth of EnglandSouth of England\7ales(   T. Thomas   (Miners) ((   T. Dingley   (Engineers)R* Beech   (Seamen and DockersA, Connal   (Building Trades)A sub-committoe, consisting of Romani Pritchard, Thomas, A*V* Williams and Kealey was elected to form a liaison with the Executive of the Communist Party of Groat Britain. x\part from the organisation of tho unofficial movement on a national taris, the conference discussed at some length the question of propaganda.   It was decided that the active men in South Wales should bo sent to assist those areas where t movement was weakest and that they should devote special attention to the Yorkshire coalfields and to the seaports, A seaman outlined the possibilities of the movement in the dock areas and delegates from the London District Council of Unemployed Organisations indicated the important role which could bo played by organised unemployed in an industrial crisis.There are signs that the National Workers&apos; Committee movement like the Bed International of Trade Unions will come into collision with the Communist Party of Great Britain, which is&apos;calling for a return of those of its members who are   trade unionists, while Kime complains that in the Manchester district the industrial field is almost unworkable owing- to the strength of the Communist Party, \imemb e]
. &quot;Tho Central Bureau for the convening of the International conference of the Seamen&apos;s, River, Dockers and Port Unions of all ./orld Marine Workers&quot;, which consists of the notorious Tom Barker, at present in Russia, Otto Rieger and A, Ischinki, havo issued a manifesto in which they invite all marine transport workers to send delegates to a conference whioh will be held in Petrograd during the second week in August, 1921.   Nearly half of this manifesto is devoted to an attack upon Mr. Havelock Wilson and his colleagues, whoso organisation the Bureau hopes to smash.   The manifesto deolaros that the industry &quot;is the most strategic point in tho modem capitalist world and it is our duty to possess ourselves of the control of world transport&quot; and that the Petrograd cor-fcronce is called &quot;with the object of creating a Rod International Federation of Marine and Transport Workers for tho purpose of establishing as soon as possible the Dictatorship of the Proletariat by taking possession of the industry and controlling it in the interests of the working class.&quot;THE SCOTTISH TR^DE UNION CONORESJ3 1Tho twenty-fourth annral meeting of the Scottish Trade Union Congress will bo held at Aberdeen-on April 20th.   The -  agenda covers a variety of industrial subjects as well as matters extraneous to trade unionism.   Scottish Homo Rule, unemploymentan instruction, to, Trade Unions to transfer their accounts to the Op.-operative Wholesalo Bank, the Irish question, condemnation of the Emergency&apos; Powers Act, affiliation to tho Red International of Trade Unions,,     indue trial/Mmembers refuse to push the &quot;Worker&quot; and &quot;Solidarity&quot; which they regard as rivals of the &quot; communist&apos;.THE RED INTFWCIONAD CF MARINE AND TRANSPORT WORKERS
industrial unionism, nationalisation of mines and railways and the publication of a trade union newspaper will be debated.ARRESTS AND convictions on April 8th James Stowart, Midland organiser of the Communist Party of Great Rritain,was arrested at V/olverhaJ and charged under the Emergency Po .rors Act with committi^ an aot oalculated to cause disaffection among the civilia population.   He was remanded for a week in custody:   his arrest has caused consternation aeon;, the conuunists in t Midlands whose branch business ha3 been dislocated.   They complain that the arrests of their loaders d-ter many would-be members from joining the Party.   Stewart was actually under recognizances from Birmingham.On April 11th James Matthews, a Manchester communist was fined  20 or in default sentenced to- 2 months&apos; imprisonment at Marlborough Streot Police Court under the Emorgency Powers Act for attempting to cause disaffectio among the civil population by a speech in Hyde Park on the previous day.   The fine was paid.The two printors and tho distributor of a manifesto to the unemployed issued by 3nery&apos;s committee in Coventr, without an imprint were fined respectively  5 each and 20 r. on April 7th.THE &quot;DAILY HEFALiD&quot;Throughout this industrial crisis the &quot;Drdly HoraiS1 has done its utmost to effect a revolution and has workel untold mischief.   Aoart from its usual propagation of the doctrine of class war the paper has consistently urged not merely a strike of the Triple Alliance but a general strike.   A feature of the paper has been the pernicious turn given to industrial news, but this is not - surprising in view of the fact that William Mellor,the/
the industrial editor, is a member of the Executive Committee of the Cmmiuiist..?arxx7 of Great Britain.Arrangements were made to publish a special edition of the   &quot;Daily Herald&quot; at midnight on ^ turday for circulation throughout the country on Sunday had the strike of the Triple Alliance materialised.   This publication vao to have been a direct incentive to rebellion and was to have been printed simultaneously in London and in Manchester:   speoial efforts had been made to ensure its distribution throughout the northern industrial areas.   As the strike was postponed it was arranged to pursue the same.policy on Tuesday night.Tho plans.- still stand and will be put into operation if tho strike threat materialises on Friday.G. Lansbury has addressed various meetings in London and on two occasions went beyond his usual theme of passive resistance&apos; by the workers to the onslaught of capitalism. On April 10th at E&amp;st hankey he said that the capitalist was dependent upon the workers to keep the workers down.   If the workers refused to shoot workers then the whole of this &quot;rotten government&quot; would collapse.On the same day Lunsoury said at Bow that the reserves were being called out and that miners and. railwaymen were among them.   He thought it was rather a serious thing to givo these men rifles as they might use them in a way not intended by the Government.   If the CI.D. man was present he hoped he would take a note of that.   He thought it would net be a bad thing if the reserves turned their rifles in that way.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; will function throughout the crisis as, the official organ of tho Misers1 Federal ion and of the Triple Alliance.   Members of the Triple Alliance have been instructed to act on orders which appear in tho &quot;Herald&apos;&quot; over tho signatures of certain of their leaders.81M/

The watchman was attached by mashed and armed men, who bound and gagged him.   He was released when the building- ras well alight and told that he need not try to telephone as the wires had been cut.   Corn and hay-ricks were destroyed at three farms in tho neighbourhood0In the triangular area formed by South Shields, Sunderland and Newsastle a number of telephone poles were sawn through about a yard from the ground on the same evening.   Many of the poles were brought down and brought the wires with them.It is stated to be the intention of Sinn Fein to makeyan attack on shipping in the Tyne.   It was proposed at a recent Irish gathering to seize motor boats lying at thewharves at South Shields, Jarrow and &apos;Tyne Dc3.k3 and to U3ethem to convey the incendiaries and inflammable materials to ships moored at buoys, on which there are only watchmen.It is reported that the local outrages are organised by theIrish Self-Determination League, in spite of the fact thatthe officials deny all knowledge.The following report has been received from acorrespondent at Liverpool:&quot;Luring my investigations into the Unemployment problem in Liverpool I frequently encountered the statement that whilst members of the Dockers1 and of the seamen s and Firemen&apos;s Unions remain unemployed, Si:ra Fein agents arriving from Ireland can secure almost immediate employment, either at the Docks or aboard ships leaving the port.   Protestant Dockers and Seamen allege that this is only possible with the connivance of responsible officers of the Trade Unions. I am informed that the Unions in question,have a system.;, known locally as the 1 But ton system&apos;, &apos; which is designed to ensure that the men&apos;who have been longest unemployed shall have the first chance cf any vacancy that may occur.   In spite of this rebels fresh from Ireland continue to be signed on ships and obtain billets amongst the docks over tho heads of Liverpool
men who have been unomployed, in some oases for months.   Sixty per cent, of Liverpool dockers are Irish Catholios which may aocount for their silence on this question.   It is certain that agents of the Irish Republican Army, before they oan leave Liverpool as members of the orew of any ship must be provided with the neoessary discharges, Trade Union oard, and must further be favoured with precedence over other . unemployed seamen.   It does not sepm possible that this could be done without the assistance of looal Trade Union offioials.&quot;During the week, branch meetings of the Irish Self-Determination League have beon held at Highbury, Southward, Lewisham and Tooting: tho lectures given were of no particular interest.   On May 6th L. At 0&apos;Mohan will lecture at the Paroohial Hall, Tooting, on the &quot;Hun in Ireland&quot;.Application was recently made by John 0&apos;Sheohan to the Glasgow Communist Group for the use of their rooms at 13, Burnbank Gardens; the communists refused to let the premises as tney oonsider the Sinn Fein movement an organisation, of Irish political capitalists who do not intend to free the Irish people from economic bondage.IRELAND /The week has been comparatively quiet in Ireland, apart from the audacious attack on cadets in the London and North Western Hotel.   There have been numerous murders of Protestants in the South.Michael Collins has modified his attitude on the question of meeting Sir James Craig: after consultation with de Valera he is willing to discuss, In Ireland, the interests of Ireland with any ^representative&apos; Irishman.It is reported, but not confirmed, that a sum of  50,000 is to be paid to certain- Sinn Fein agents in Ireland through the Russian Trading Delegation.The following list of offioials in the Foreign PropagandaDepartment of Sinn Fein is of particular interest;&apos;Hirector/r

appendix to THE SOLDIERS      MEMBERS OF TH  HSOIKIHG CLASSSoldiers, Comrades,In the present crisis, due to the lock-out of the Miners, the Government has called upon you - our Comrades in uniform to heat down the workers.   Most of you aro in khaki , because you aro unable to get work and pay that will give you a decent standard of life.You come from tho Working Class.You know what low wages moan.You know what unemployment means.Unemployment is being used by the capitalists to foroe us, the Workers, to accept starvation conditions for our wives and children.You have boen brought in to help the employers. Will you do so?The Government in using you, will not send Lancashire Regiments to Lancashire, Welsh Regiments to Wales, or Sootoh troops to Scotland.   They are too cunning.   They know better ... they dare not.They know no soldier can be relied upon to shoot down, or threaten the workers in his own district.No soldier who is a human being - who is a man -would shoot down his own people.Yet wherever you are sent, whoever you are sentt to subdue, remember they will be workers.   Members of your own Class.   If not your own relatives and friends they are other soldiers&apos; relatives, and among them men who were your regimentscomrades/
comrades a short time ago.Think of it1, Soldiers, Comrades,It is like this.   The late war has been proved to have been fought solely in the interests of the rich. * It has created ruin for the mass of the people everywhere.   The wage earners of all countries have been the sufferers.   Some gave their lives, others are maimed.   Those who remain are now fighting against being forced to accept slave conditions, On the other hand, the rich in all countries are still weal! and in the winning countries even richer than before, and in order to remain so they are now trying to still further redw the standard of our daily existence.The Miners, the advance guard of the workers, have refused to accept starvation conditions.   Rather than see thi wives and children condemned to poverty they will fight fori better life ... if need be with arms.In spite of the capitalist press, which is trying to poison your minds against us, and in face of the united attai by the governing and employing class, we will resist tpe onsl of our enemies.   Whose side will you be on?Remember the Government that orders you to move agaii us is not our, nor your Government, it is the instrument of the employers, the profiteers.But we are the more numerous, we have the industrial power, we creators and the distributors of all wealth. With our labour the wheels of industry are turned; when we withho our labour all production ceases. We refuse, at the orders those living in luxury and idleness, to live any longer miss and poverty stricken lives.
And wo count on your help.&quot;You are our oIebs and will know the bitterness of our lives.Our fight is your fight, Yet you alone stand between us end victory. Soldier Comrades, do not boar arms against your friends and relatives, against your own brothers, against your own class.   Come over and join with us in the fight for a better and a freer life.Long Live tho Working Class&apos;.
