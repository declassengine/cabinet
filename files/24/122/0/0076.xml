386The attached correspondence Is circulated with reference to Cabinet Papers C.P.-2081 and C.P.-2808.(3d) M.P.A.HANKEY,Secretary.i^Mghall Gardens, 3.W.I. 26th April, 1921.Secretary, Imperial Communications Committee to Vice-chairman of MiFelesTTelegrapli Commission.IDiKTIAD. 13th April, 1921,Reference 17/G/70. Dear licclesIiI notice from the Minutes of the Thirteenth Meeting of the ./irelesa Telegraph Commission whioh was dealing with the wave-lengths to be asked for by us at the proposed Conference in - aris, that representatives of the (Government of India were present in order to Inform the Sommission what wave-lengths are required by India.I further notice that, when giving their evidence to your Commission, the Indian representatives stated that theGovernment of India wished for direct wireless communicationwith the United Kingdom and Europe generally.You will recollect that Sir Henry Norman^ &quot;ImperialV/ireless telegraphy Committee&quot; after full consideration of allthe different systems that might be used, recommended that for communication with India, the tfar uast and Australia, valvestations -
-   387stations should oe erected in England, near Oairc, at Poona for other Indian station), at oing&amp;pore, at -onrr iCong and in 1 Australia at Port Darwin or Perth,In case the question is raised and has to ho considered by the imperial -ioanuni oat ions Committee, I should like to be ready with tno views of the experts on /our Yfireless Commission, cvs to whether direct tireless communication between the Unitod Kingdom and Inrla is, unier existing conditions, a practical proposition, both from the technical and economic-1 points of view,   therefore I should be obliged if you would get their opinion on this point.   If by any chance direct communication v,ers decided on, your JommiSJion wouK have to be asked to design the aooossar;/ stations.Yours sincerely, (Sd).i.H.Secies &apos;&amp;acX4, D.8o.f II.I.L1.3., 2, Ryder Street,3t. James1, tf.i7.1.Yioe^Jh-iirman,   ,&apos;irelapa Telegraph Oomalssion to oepr&apos;e&quot;tarj7^&quot;&apos;Impe&quot;rial&quot; 0 o^imipations&quot; Jommittee&apos;^2,  /hitshall Gardens, S.v/,1. 20th April, 1921.Deal wilson,In reply to your latter concerning the feasibility of establishing a Cirect wireless commercial service be-tween the United kingdom and India, the Commission havegiven this matter careful and sympathetic considerationduring the past two months ar.cl have kept it in mind during their recent inspection of the French wireless services. Thisvisit to 1&apos;rance, added to the information accumulated since theformation of the Jommis3ion, has placed the Commission ina very  ood position, I think, tor giving an impartialand up to date opinion on the matter.!i&apos;he Jorami3Sion visited at the end of last month the principal wireless receiving station of 1 ranee, which iso situated
situated at Villejuif near Paris. Here a number of distinct sets were receiving commercial and other messages from the high power stations on the Eastern coast of the U.S.A. and from various European points. Three of the sets have been erected by the Government services, Tout two special set housed in separate buildings have been supplied by commercial firms to their own specifications under a Financial arrangement with the French Post Office.

The Commission&apos;s impression of the traffic being carried on was that even in March and using modern apparatus atmospheric disturbances are a serious hindrance to traffic across the North Atlantic. These distances are somewhat less than 4,000 statute miles. The apparatus recommended by the commercial firms was receiving from the American stations Tuckerton and Annanpolis which are very powerful. There is no doubt that delays in traffic due to atmospheric conditions will be more numerous in the summer months than in Spring.

The Commission also visited the transmitting station near Bordeaux which is the largest and perhaps the most powerful in existence. The antenna and earth system alone cost more than £200,000 and the equipment is of the most modern description. The opinion of the French experts, both Governmental and commercial, based upon the past winter&apos;s working, tends towards the view that it is only sufficient for the Trans-atlantic span, and the French Government have already laid the foundation stone of a great new station of more than double the power.

On the whole the Commission&apos;s experience in France indicate that in order to attempt good commercial service at all seasons of the year across the North Atlantic (nearly 4,000 miles) it is necessary to erect the transmitting stations of at least 500 Kw., costing about £300,000 in England, including sites and buildings but no residences.

It
It 13 clear therefore that in oroer to transmit     &quot;      &quot;03 ovor land from England to India (a distance of 4,600 miles) it wixl be necessary to erect stations more powerful and co3tly than those, firstly because of the greater distance, secondly because it is overland, and thirdly, because the signals would have to be received in a tropical country where atmospheric conditions are immensely worse than in temperate latitudes.   Suitable transmitting stations would together cost at least one million sterling and no genuine guarantee could be given with regard to performance, for the reason that there is no eirperience in the world on such a problem.On the 26th March last as Vice-Chairma-o of th* Commission I visited the larconi Company and met the Managing Director, the three Vanac.ers and the two principal Engineers in conference concerning the reception of long distance signals at tropical receiving stations, with a view to inviting the Company to submit for test the apparatus they would recommend and be able to supply.     They strongly advocated certain types of patentee apparstus depending upon well-known principles. I was informed that the vompany had no o^perience sf the oehaviour of this apparatus in tropical or sub-tropical countries but was assured that it aad proved very successful in the United Kingdom.   I pointed out to the Comp.-.nyTs representatives that judging from my own personal experience of tropical working tnis success probably would not oe regarded by the Commission as sufficient evidence of suitability for Sgypt, In;ia or other hot countries.   The Commission have not as yet heard further from the Company.iVireless transmission varies greatly with atmospheric conditions.   It is ejected that the proposed short-link stations of the Imperial Chain will be able to communicateduring certain intervals of each day across distances of5,000 miles or more and that direct communication between england and India sufficient for strategical purposes will-4- bo
be obtained b/ means oi the proposed short-*liiLfc: stations.Briefly it m% be said that stations giving a.commercial ser-vice across 2,500 miles will give strategical communicationacross 5,000 miles.   On the other hand for an equivalentcommercial service across distances of 5,000 and 2,500 m^lesit would be necessary to provide enormously more powerful stations for the longer ran^e thai: for the shorter; -there is absolutely no practical ouperience in existence thatwill give the exact proportion where tropical oou-rtries       /are concerned,I am authorised to say that the Commission wouia be prepared to g;o into fuller detail in this matter of direot communication between England and India if so instructed. In the course of the next low months they hope to obtain trustworthy data concerning reception in tropical countries.Yours sincerely,(3d), W.300LBS.
