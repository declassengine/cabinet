THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNtC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINETtREFUSAL OF TRANSPORT WORKERS TO HANDLE COAL. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTSR OF LABOUR.36* A matter of urgency has arisen owing to the instructions issuedby the National Transport Workers1 Federation to their members to refuse to handle coal - either coal that is being imported, or coal that is to be utilised for the purposes of ships which are being partially bunkered here so that they may go to continental ports to complete bunkering.Sir Joseph Broodbank, Chairman of the National Council of Port Labour Employers, has been to see me to-day (having been referred to me by the Minister of Transport) because the employers . at Glasgow and Manchester, where ships have been held up, have communicated with Sir Joseph in order that he may ascertain the views of the Government as to the action which the employers ought to take.I have seen Mr. H. Gosling and Ivlr. Robert Williams, Chairman and Secretary of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation; they inform me that the Feet oration adhere to the policy which they adopt-ed on the S5rd instant.   The fact that the Railwaymen have agreed to modify their attitude to the extent of confining their embargo to coal &quot;which is intended to be used for commercial purposes&quot; has no effect upon the Transport Workers policy; the Transport Workers state that they cannot differentiate on the ships between coal to be used for public utility, domestic, or hospital purposes, and coal to be used for &quot;commercial purposes&quot;.I have asked Sir Joseph Broodbank to request his colleagues to take no action for the next twenty-four hours.   This may prevent what the employers may otherwise be tempted to do, viz., obtain alternative labour for the work.   This they say they can obtain.-   j.   -4/R51a.
If they arc loft to thorcselvos the employers will probably insist upon tho coal being handled.     They feel, however, that the matter is one upGn which they ought to have the directions of the Government.I have undertaken to coirminlcate with Sir Joseph Broodbank as early as possible tomorrow.(Intld.) T.J.U.Ministry of Labour. 28/4/PI.
