P. 2bl2INDUSTRIAL SITUATION.Statement made by the Prime Minister in Parliament on Friday, April 8th, 1921.Before the House rose last night I intimated that I proposed to ask the Coal-owners and the Miners&apos; Federation to a joint conference at which the first subject for discussion should be the pumping and preservation of the mines, it being understood that, until that question was disposed of, no other matter should&quot;be taken up.     This morning I acted in accordance with that intention, and addressed to the Miners&apos; Federation the following letter:-10 Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W.1. 8th April, 1921,Pear Mr, Williams,In the course of the Discussion in the House of Commons last night certain suggestions were made by Leaders of the Labour Party which have led me to make to you a further proposal for a meeting with the Hiners-1 Federation in order to make a start towards a solution of the present dispute.A suggestion was made to the effect that a Conference might be summoned by the Government which should deal in the first instance with the question of the pumping and preservation of the mines and that that matter should be disposed of before any other question was entered upon. The Government&quot; has considered this suggestion and 1 have now to invite your Association to send representatives at 12 o*clock noon today to a conference to be held at the Board of Trade upon these terms.Yours faithfully,(Signed) D. LLOYD GEORGE.Evan Williams Esq.,
A similar invitation was au&amp;ressea to tho Ooal-c vv n o r rT A s s o o i a t i o n eI received the following replies :C oal- owne rs1 Reply 0Reply from the Miners1 Ie:&apos;.ercvbion.The IJiniu: Association of CtoBritainBth April, 19810Dear Mr. Prime iiinister,I bog to acknowledge the receipt of your letter inviting representatives of the Mining Association to a conference with representatives of the Miners1 Federation to be hold at the i:-o--rd of Trade at neon today, at which the question oi the pumping ani. preservation of the mines would be da alt with in the first instance and disposed ci&apos; before any other question was entered uponcOn this understanding the Owners accept your invitation,-.I remain,Yours faithfully,(3d), EVAN WILLIAMS,Miners.1 J^der^ticn, of .Gt*Britai 8th April, 19,21cPear Prime Minister,We thank you for your letter oi this morning and hasten to inform you.that we toe fully considered your proposal for a meeting with the coalowners this morning at 12 c1clockdeal in the first instance with the question of the pumping and preservation of the mines an6 that that matter should be disposed oi before any other question was entered upoho We have already stateC to you in clear terms that we are wi!3.ing and ready to meet the Owners and the Government at any time and place convenient to all parties and are willing to meet as scon as we hear from you that the conference is to be held entirely freed from any preliminary conditions as to what is to bo or is not to be discussed.

10,, Downing Street S *^1 1. April 8th, 1921.&apos;^Dear Mr. Hodges,I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of this morning.    You state that you desire to be free to discuss&quot; fully every aspect of the present situation with a view to ar-riving at a speedy and honourable oonoluslon.    This is also the wish of the Government.    V7e have never suggested that any limitation should be imposed upon discussion, but as regards the order In which matters are to be discussed the national interest in the preservation of the mines is paramount and it must take first place*    ,rhile the mines are hourly being flood-ed and ruined and one of the most valuable of national assets being destroyed it is Impossible to expect other questions to be debated.    Accordingly the question of the safety of the mines must first be disoussed and disposed of before other matters are taken up*I therefore invite you to a Conference in this sense and will be glad if representatives of your Federation will attand at the Board of Trade this afternoon at 3 o&apos;clook for this purpose.Yours faithfully,(Signed)   D. LLOYD GSORGE.I have now reoeived the following reply;-THE MINERS1 FEDERATION.April 8th, 1921.Desr prime Minister,I have to inform you that your further letter has been con-sidered by my Committee.        noto your clearly stated condition that the question of the &quot;Safety of the mines must firs^ be discussed and disposed of before other hatters are taken up.w We think the condition stands in the way of a resumption of ne-negotiations.As previously stated we are billing to meet the owners and the Government in conference at once if we are allowed to meet unconditionally.    We trust that the government will raise no obstacle to ensure this end.Yours truly,sd. Frank Hodges.The answer of the Miners1 Federation obviously did not meet the point which I had put, viz.. that the question of freeing the mines from water should first be discussed and disposed of, and I accordingly addressed to Mr. Hodges the following letter
From those communications and from the statements Neitherately made at the meeting with me yesterday it is plain that the Executive Committee of the &apos;!lnorsJ Federation are resolved to let the mines go to destruC&quot; tion in the belief that they will th&apos;8 intimidate the Government into a surrender to their nrmnls.The desperate character of this policy is visible in the disastrous effects which it will have on the livelihood-hood of the miners themselves.     hole villages which derive their entire support from the mining industry will become derelict, and thousands of families will he deprived of the means of existence.   And from the point of view of the. nation as a whole the results are not less calamitous.   Goal is the foundation of industry, and to wreck coal-mines or allow them to be ruined by flooding is to strike at the life of the whole body of citizens0 It is accordingly tho duty of the Government, as tho trustee of the nation, to prevent this catastrophe, more especially as it i3 becoming increasingly clear that in some places at any rate largo organised bodies of miners are, by threats of violence, preventing this necessary work being done by the mine officials and others willing to help.Protection and ade yuate protection must be given to those who are engaged in preserving those vital assets of the community.   No other course is open to us.   The nation is, for the first time in its history, confronted by an attempt to coerce it into capitulation by the des-trnction of its.resources, and this menace is apparently now,to be supplemented by a concerted plan to suspend the transp rt..services which ar*e essential to the life of the country.&apos;
If ta -3 threatened railway and transport worker a strike tak) s pi-e 3 the supply of food and of other immediate necessaries of life will      denied to all classes of the population unless vol-unteers come forward to carry cp  the minimum of transport work required to maintain the nOat essential national and municipal services,     The government proposes xo call for volunteers tc help carry on,these services, and announcements will he made telling volunteers at what centres they should apply to &quot;be regis-tared and instructed as to the help which they can b at afford.These toe will need&quot;adequate   protection in the discharge their patriotic duties while it is no less essential that, in the face of such * widespread disturbance of the ordinary machinery Of the life of tho community, law and order should be effectively mai Gained.     The police force, even when strengthened by the enrol merit of special constables, for which an appeal will bo issued, will obviously be insufficient for this task in view of tho very large number of points that require protection and of the organ-ised character of the interference with the \o lnntary workers. They are entitled %  look to the Governs nt for protection and help from the armed forces of the Crown in their difficult task. This protection the government has deal ded to afford them in what-ever measure may be necessary, and therefore proposes to make a special appeal to patriotic - ci tizens&apos; to enlist in an emergency &apos; force, recruited not for the purpose of interfering in any wage dispute, but solely to support t-te Police in the fulfilment of their duties to the &quot;community.. Enlistment for this force&apos;, which we propose to c all the Defence   Force, will be for- 90 days at the ordinary rates of j. ay s allowances.   The Territorial Force will&quot; not he embodied or asked 1 serve, but members of the Territorial Force and ex-Service men generally-will to specially iawited to enlist.   Enlistment will commence tomorrow at the Territorial Drill Halls and Headquarters, -The Government have also come to the conclusion that it is
necessary, with the same objects in view, to strengthen the armed forces of the Grown nor serving, and I have therefore advised the King that a situation has arisen in which he is justified in b.snotioning the issue of a Proclamation calling up the Reserves of the Army, Kavy and Air tforoe.The cause of the This&amp;aeat dispute ie being represented in some quarters as a delibsrate attach up on the wages cf the worker.    Shore is no justification of a.y kind for this suggestion.    The Government have never pronounced any opinion, nor have we formed any, upon JM&amp;3 rates of wages which have been offered to the miners by the ooai-omere: they have not even been discussed between the parties.    When our services were offered in attempting to bring the parties together upon that matter the reply of the miners was that it was of no use unless the Government were prepared to subsidise the coal industry.    It was clearly acknowledged by the miners that at the present tine  the proceeds of the coal industry are not sufficient to yield the wages which the miners demand, and the only ears presented to the Government by the miners is one for an immediate subsidy from the Exchequer.     To this propositl on the Government have been unable to agree, for reasons which have already been fully sYtated ana are easily understood.2 Whitehall gardens, S.W.1, 8th April, 1921.
