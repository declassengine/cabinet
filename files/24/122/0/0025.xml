GENERAL.3. The industrial situation is at present entirely overshadowed by the dispute in the coal industry. Owing to the fact that this dispute coincided with the extended holiday period, it is difficult to estimate how far it is at present affecting the labour situation, but large numbers of men have already been discharged from the iron and steel industry and also from engineering works. The pottery trade is also affected, owing to the small stocks of coal which are held by the manufacturers. In the ship-building trade the number of unemployed continues to increase steadily, although some of the men are finding intermittent employment on repair work. There is a distinct improvement in the cotton industry. It is understood that a definite turn for the better has taken place in this industry, but it is expected that the revival will be gradual, and no sudden decline in unemployment is anticipated. A more optimistic feeling prevails in regard to the jute industry, and it is believed that the worst period of the depression in this industry is over. Conditions continue to improve very slowly in the boot and shoe trade, but in the woollen, hosiery and lace trades the position remains unchanged. Unemployment remains heavy among fishermen. Among minor trades affected by the coal stoppage are the glass-bottle and fire-brick trades.II. EMERGENCY WORK.On the 19th October, the Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. A further statement was made in the House by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December.1. The schemes of work then outlined (which have been more fully described in Report No. 22 for the week ended the 18th March, 1921, and earlier reports to the Cabinet) included the following : (a.) Arterial Roads.The anticipating of a four years&apos; programme for arterial roads in London and in the Provinces.(b.) Road Maintenance,Pressing forward with the Ministry of Transport programme of road classifica-tion and maintenance grants.(c.) Housing.The acceleration of the lay-out of roads and sewers on approved housing schemes work brought forward as additional to the main programme.(d.) Unemployment Grants Committee.The distribution by the Unemployment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids,, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities on relief schemes other than house-building work and certain kinds of road work.(e.) Unemployment Insurance.The amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit.2. More recently the following additional measures have been devised by the Government, viz.: (a.) The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921.&apos; Under this Act, which became law on the 3rd March, the rate of benefit was raised from 155. to 20s. for men and from 12s. to 16s. for women, and it was provided(10821 . B 2
Grand Total......     83,652* No figures are at present available in respect of Admiralty Establishments later than for the 19th March.  It is known, however, that some hundreds of men have been discharged since that date.that benefit might be drawn for sixteen weeks in each of two periods running from the 3rd March, 1921, to the 2nd November, 1921, and from the 3rd November, 1921, to the 2nd July, 1922; after the last date benefit to be drawn to the extent of twenty-six weeks in each insurance year.(b.) Alternative Work.Alternative work has been arranged by the War Office at five national factories. This includes waggon-repairing, manufacture of medals, coin blanks, locomotives and new waggons and miscellaneous articles for the Post Office and for private firms.Alternative work has also been adopted at His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Industrial Establishments, but fresh entries for this work ceased on the 19th March, 1921.(c.) Short-time in Government Establishments.This policy was introduced on the 24th January, 1921, in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Establishments and in the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich Arsenal and other National Factories administered by the War Office.It was also introduced, where practicable, in the remaining War Departments, Industrial and Semi-Industrial Departments and Factories from the 7th February. No further entries in Admiralty Establishments have been made since the 19th March, 1921.(d.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.This includes a considerable amount of decorating and repair work in Govern-ment Departments with a view to the absorption of unemployed painters and similar workpeople. The entire programme is expected to be completed by the middle of May and the numbers of men employed are being gradually reduced.3. Other Public Work. In addition, various Local Authorities throughout the country are employing labour on schemes of relief work which have not been assisted by Government grants.Returns are received weekly from the Government Departments responsible and from the Local Authorities in regard to all the schemes of works indicated above, and the latest returns show that the number of men for whom emergency work has been found in this way is as follows : Summary of Labour engaged on Relief Schemes.

As reports for the week ended the 8th April have been received from only 298 Local Authorities out of 355 who were asked to supply information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of 85,000.(The Ministry of Transport estimate that there are also some 20,000 men employed on road maintenance and repair work over and above those ordinarily so employed.)III.
