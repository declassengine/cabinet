-\JJHLcme Affairs1IT lo 1*the PRCriiRTY OF HIS britBILL *te Minister of Healthsm.e.34.Tho Rome Affairs Qommittoo, at thoir meeting of February 22nd, decided that draft clauses of a Bill enabling Uator Companies to increase their charges should be circulated together with a state-went showing precisely the financial difficulty of tho Ccmpanio3.Tho financial difficulty is that at the present time many Water Companies and Local Authorities find that tho revenue derived from their statutory charges Is insufficient to moot thoir expenditure *In tho case of many Companies this is preventing them from borrowing money required for extensions of mains which are urgently required, their dividends are much reduced, and their shares aro practically unsaleable.In this session some thirty Bills and Provisional Orders are being promoted raising the statutory charges,    Thi3 is a very expensive way cf procooding, and for many of the smaller Water Companies it is out of the question.     In all those Bills clauses are being inserted empowering tho Minister of Health to raise or lower the charges now fixed.It is proposed therefore to pass a short general Bill empowering tho Minister of Health by Order to raise or lower water charges on the application of the undertakers or of any Local Authority acting within the limits of supply.If tho Order is objected to, It will require confirmation by Parliament,Draft Glauses have been agreed with -iThe British Waterworks Association, Tho water Companies1 Association, The Municipal Corporations Association. The Urban District Councils Association, The Rural District Councils Association.
A copy of tho clauses is annexed.Legislative provision has already been made- for revision of charges in the case of  as, tramways, harbours, docks and piers., The fairness of making similar provision for water undertakings is beyond question, and a promise to introduce legislation as soon 8,9 possible was given last year in the House of Commons,The National Industrial Council for the Waterworks Undertakings Industry have passed a resolution on the lines of the policy embodied in tne clauses.    Accordingly I think the clauses may be said to be not controversial, and I ask for authority to frame a Bill and * introduce It as early as possible.ALFRED MOND.14.4,1921.nistry of Health,
