[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1921.SECRET.REPORT ON MIDDLE EAST CONFERENCE HELD IN CAIRO AND JERUSALEM, MARCH 12 TO 30, 1921.I.-EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CONFERENCE AND procedure adopted.) -er-1. ON the 14th February, 1921, the Cabinet met to consider the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee which had been appointed by the Prime Minister to make recommendations as to the formation of a new Department under the Colonial Office to deal with mandated and other territories in the Middle East (Appendix 1).The Cabinet decided to approve generally the recommendations contained in the Report on the understanding: (i.) That this approval involved no modification of the present arrange-incuts, under whioh the revenues of the Government of India bore a portion of Middle Eastern expenditure; and(ii.) That the Committee&apos;s proposals should, before being put into force, be communicated to and approved by the Government of India.They also agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to visit Egypt in the early part of March for the purpose of consulting with the British authorities in Palestine and Arabia as proposed.2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies immediately commenced the formation of the new Department, which was to take over from the Foreign Office, India Office and War Office on the 1st March. He had recommended to the Cabinet that, in order to ensure the immediate carrying out of the necessary measures to effect economies in the Middle East, it would be necessary for him to hold a Conference at some convenient centre, where he could meet, and discuss outstanding questions with, the responsible civil and military officials in the areas whose control had been transferred to the Colonial Office. The most convenient meeting-place was Cairo, and, as soon as it was confirmed that there was no local objection, arrangements were made for the High Commissioners and General Officers Commanding in Palestine and Mesopotamia, the General Officer Com-manding in Persia, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Governor of Somaliland, and the Resident at Aden, with such staffs as they might consider necessary, to meet there early in March.3. Provisional agenda were at the same time prepared by the Middle East Department and communicated by telegraph to all concerned. The departmental view on the questions to be discussed was submitted to the Secretary of State before his departure, after it had been discussed confidentially with a number of officers of local experience who happened to be in London at the time (Appendix 2).4. On the 1st March the Secretary of State left London for Egypt, accom-panied by Air-Marshal Sir Hugh. Trenchard, K.C.B., D.S.O., Chief of the Air Staff, and officials of the Middle East Department. Major-General Sir P. P. de B. Radcliffe, K.C.M.G., C.B., D.S.O., Director of Military Operations, Mr. J. B. Crosland, Finance Department of the War Office, and Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Treasury, joined the party at Cairo.   During the voyage from Marseilles[6053]B
--to Alexandria, a programme for the Conference was approved by the Secretary of State (Appendix 3), and more detailed agenda prepared for the first discussions on Mesopotamia (Appendix 5). Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Congreve, V.C., K.C.B., commander-in-Chief in Egypt and Palestine, who was returning to Alexandria by the same ship as the Secretary of State, most kindly consented to act as Chairman of the Military and Financial Committee throughout the entire Conference. To his unfailing tact and resource the complete unanimity, which was such a striking feature of the Conference, was very largely due.5. A list of Members of the Conference, by Missions, will be found in Appendix 4. The first session was held on the 12th March, when the Secretary of State explained his object in calling the Conference, and outlined the programme to be followed. The Conference then split up into Committees, the composition of which varied with the subject under discussion, but which may be classified under the two main heads of Political and Military. Mr. R. D. Badcock, M.C., whose services were lent by the High Commissioner for Palestine, acted as Secretary to the Conference as a whole, and also to all Political Committees. The services of Lieutenant-Colonel B. H. Waters-Taylor, C.B.E., were similarly placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State by the Commander? in-Chief, Egypt and Palestine, as Secretary to the Military Committees. It reflects great credit upon these two officers, and especially upon Mr. Badcock, who made all arrangements for providing a temporary Secretariat, that such a full and accurate record was kept of between forty and fifty Committee meetings held between the 12th and the 24th March.(1. On the night of the 23rd March the Secretary of State left Cairo for Jerusalem, where further meetings were held to discuss questions affecting Palestine and Trans-Jordania, representative deputations were received, and visits paid to outlying districts. On the same day Sir George Barstow arrived in Cairo from London and presided over meetings which considered various financial questions relating to Mesopotamia. The Missions from Mesopotamia, Aden and Soinaliland left Cairo on the 25th March, the Financial Adviser to the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia remaining until the 27th in order to complete the discussion of financial matters with Sir George Barstow, who then left Cairo for Jerusalem.7. A summary of the conclusions arrived at will be found in the succeeding sections of this report, to which the minutes of the more important Committee meetings are attached its appendices.II.-MESOPOTAMIA.1. The main Mesopotainian agenda (Appendix -0) were discussed by two Committees; a Political Committee, presided over by the Secretary of State (Appendix 0), and a Military and Financial Committee, presided over by Sir Walter Congreve (Appendix 7). These two Committees also met together as a combined Committee, under the Secretary of State (Appendix 8), when the political and military proposals were considered side by side and co-ordinated. Sub-Committees of this combined Committee considered detailed questions relating to the distribution of troops and the&apos; respective roles of military and air forces.2. The Conference decided that political conditions involved the necessity for a Sheridan ruler to be selected for Mesopotamia, and that the most suitable ruler was the Emir Feisal. It was fully realised that His M!ajesty&apos;s Government could not nominate Feisal, but that he must be chosen by the people of Mesopotamia. At the same time it was felt that without his actual presence in the country it was possible that the activities of local candidates might prejudice his claims. It was also necessary to consider French susceptibilities, and a detailed programme was worked out for the successive steps necessary to ensure the best possible chance of Feisal being selected by the people of Mesopotamia as their ruler without His Majesty&apos;s Government taking too active a part in pressing for his acceptance (Appendix 9).3. On the assumption that the programme could be satisfactorily carried out, the Conference decided that the garrison of Mesopotamia could be reduced to a total of twenty-three battalions as fast as shipping could be made available. Proportionate reductions of staffs, auxiliary services of all kinds, followers and animals would follow.   It was estimated that the resultant saving in the estimatet
for Palestine and Mesopotamia in 19*21-22 would amount to 5  millions, provided that prompt action was taken at all points. A further saving would result if the Government of India could be induced to shorten the time during which Indian troops remained on Imperial charge after repatriation to India. It was not proposed that the garrison should be reduced below the twenty-three battalion scale until after the hot wTeather. Meanwhile steps were recommended in order to facilitate a further reduction in October.4. The Conference realised that any attempt to force purely Kurdish districts under the rule of an Arab Government would inevitably be resisted (Appendix 10). They accordingly recommended that, until such time as a representative body of Kurdish opinion might opt for inclusion in Iraq, Kurdistan should be dealt with direct by the High Commissioner, and kept separate from Iraq itself. The advantage of this solution would be that His Majestys Government would be enabled to recruit Kurdish units under British officers, and thus to improvise a force which was more likely to be in a position to take over from the British garrison the defence of the frontier than an Aral) army officered entirely by Arabs (Appendix 11). It was recognised that the existing force of Arab levies under British officers must for the present remain in existence, though political Considerations demanded that measures should at the same time be adopted for the raising of a purely Arab army. It was accordingly decided that the existing Arab levies should be expanded by the addition of Kurdish and Assyrian units, and also by the recruitment of Arabs to replace the Kurdish elements in the existing organisation. By this means it was hoped to effect the early withdrawal of the Imperial garrisons in Kirkuk and other frontier districts. Speed, combined with maximum efficiency, was the object of this arrangement, and it was anticipated that, as the Arab army grew and became capable of taking over the whole country, the levy organisation, except in Kurdistan, would gradually disappear. The cost of the levy organisation would he borne on the Colonial Office vote, subject to a possible contribution by the Mesopotamian Government. The cost of the Arab army, on the other hand, would be borne entirely on Mesopotaniian revenues, and would constitute for the year 1921-22 the contri-bution of that Government towards the cost of Mesopotaniian defence.5, Assuming that the country remained quiet internally and was not disturbed from outside, that the Arab Government proved a success, and that good progress were made in the training of the local levies and the development of the Arab army, it was hoped that a further reduction in the Imperial garrison to a twelve battalion scale, with further resultant savings, might take place in October, but this would of course be contingent upon events (Appendix 12).0. The Conference then discussed the normal or permanent garrison for Mesopotamia, which it was hoped to reach some time in the year 1922-23.A scheme for the control of Mesopotamia by the Royal Air Force was submitted by the Chief of the Air Staff and approved in principle by the Conference (Appendix IB). If this scheme were brought into operation, the Imperial garrison in Mesopotamia would eventually be reduced to 1 brigade and 1 pack battery. The alternative would be the retention in Mesopotamia of an Imperial garrison of 12 battalions of infantry, 1 cavalry regiment, 1 field battery, 1 pack battery, 1 sapper and miner company and 5 squadrons of the Royal Air Force. The Conference recommended that, in calculating the comparative advantages of these two alternatives, consideration should be given to the vital necessity of preparing and training an Air Force adequate to war requirements, the importance of testing the potentialities of the Air Force, the need for giving to superior officers and staffs experience in independent command and responsibility, and the provision of an all-British military and commercial air route to India (Section V, paragraph 3).7. The following recommendations were made for the immediate disposal of the various refugees who were being maintained at the cost of the Imperial exchequer in Mesopotamia (Appendix 14):-(a.) Armenians. There were 14,000 Armenian refugees at Basra, who could neither be repatriated by land nor absorbed into the population of the country. No provision had been made for their maintenance during the financial year 1921-22. It was clear that they could not remain indefinitely in Mesopotamia, and the Conference accordingly recom-mended that they should be shipped forthwith to some port on the Black Sea, the Foreign Office being asked to recommend which locality was most suitable, in the light of the Turkish situation.
(b.) Russians. There were some 800 Russian refugees at Basra who had been evacuated from Enzeli by the War Office under conditions arranged with the local Bolshevik commander. The Conference considered that they were in exactly the same position as the Russian refugees awaiting repatriation in Egypt. They would almost certainly be executed if they were sent back to Russia, as they were for the most part very obnoxious to the Bolshevik Government. It was realised that the time had not yet arrived for their repatriation, but it was considered desirable both from a humanitarian and from an economic point of view that they should be removed from Basra, where considerable mortality would be caused among them by the hot weather, to Egypt where their compatriots were being well looked after and assisted to some extent by local charities, the Conference accordingly recom-mended that they should be shipped immediately to Egypt with the exception of a few who might possibly obtain employment in Mesopotamia. The only alternative was that they should be shipped to Constantinople where the problem of the disposal of the large number of Russian refugees already there would not be materially affected by the influx of so small a number as 800. (o.) Assyrians. The High Commissioner for Mesopotamia had already warned all the Assyrian refugees that no funds would be available for their maintenance during the financial year 1921-22, and that on the 1st April steps would be taken to close down the refugee camps. The Assyrians fell under two categories: Urumians and mountaineers. TheUrumians were those who had had already one chance of repatriation but had turned back owing to severe winter conditions. The Conference under-stood that there was no real prospect of these refugees being received either by the United States of America or in the French zone in Syria. They could not be absorbed into the local population of Mesopotamia, and no destination suggested itself to which they could be shipped. The Conference considered that there was no alternative but to give them some arms for their protection, and to turn them out to make their way back if they could to their own country. A small number might possibly be assisted by American charity, and some might enlist in the new levies.With regard to the mountaineers the Conference recommended that they should be settled locally in conjunction with the new levy scheme. It was proposed that a few Assyrian companies should be raised under British officers and distributed along the frontier in localities where there appeared to be reasonable prospect of small Assyrian communities being settled down. It was anticipated that this would involve a total maximum expenditure of 200,000/. to meet the cost of providing them with agricultural implements, &amp;c. The Conference recommended that this should be done, the expenditure involved being included in the proposed grant-in-aid for Mesopotamia.8. Various financial questions were discussed in the first place by Committees under the Secretary of State, and provisional conclusions were arrived at, which were discussed with Sir George Barstow after the Secretary of State had left Cairo for Jerusalem (Appendix 15). Sir George Barstow&apos;s final recommendations as approved by the Secretary of State were on the following general lines: The Imperial Government to be responsible for any net difference between the expenditure and receipts (on a cash basis) whether civil or military, in Mesopotamia up to 31st March, 1921, Capital assets derived from military expenditure from vote of credit or army funds, e.g.f railways, port, electric appliances, telegraphs, &amp;c, to be vested in the Colonial Office as from the 1st April, 1921, but as a general principle air properties which had been paid for by civil revenues, as shown in expenditure accounts of the civil administration of Mesopotamia, to be vested in the Mesopotamia!! Government. The Imperial assets to be disposed of as soon as convenient, as far as possible to the Mesopotamian Government at a fair valuation,, failing this to private persons or companies. Payments by the Mesopotamian Government would probably not be made in cash, but would constitute an interest bearing debt due by Mesopotamia to the Home Government. Payment of interest might be deferred until the finances of Mesopotamia were in a position to bear them.   The Mesopotamian budget should in future meet all civil charges, and in
addition provide a contribution to Imperial military charges. This contribution would for the present take the form of provision made for an Arab army to enable Imperial forces to be reduced. The local levies, Arab, Kurdish and Assyrian, would be regarded as Imperial forces.9. Railway capital charges could not be met from current revenues of Mesopotamia (Appendix 10). An otter w,is made by Sir Arnold Wilson, on behalf of Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co., to purchase the Mesopotamian railways. The Secretary of State considered that it was inadvisable to accept this offer, more especially as the Company demanded a guarantee from his Majesty^ Government. He was of opinion that if the hot weather passed quietly, and the policy suggested by the Conference proved successful, more advantageous offers could be expected in the future than were then justified. It was estimated that an expenditure of 325,000/. would be required during the year 1921-22 as the first pail: of a scheme of reconstruction and reconditioning of the Mesopotamian railways, which might eventually require as much as 0,000,0007. In order to relieve the administration of the liability of finding fresh capital for the railways, it was considered desirable that a bargain should be struck with private enterprise as early as possible, but it was not anticipated that this could bo done until the political outlook was more settled.111.-PALESTINE.1. The Palestine Mission under Sir Herbert Samuel arrived in Cairo on the Kith March and left on the 23rd for Jerusalem with the Secretary of State. *The outstanding question to be discussed was the policy to be adopted with regard to Trans-Jordania, and its effect upon the strength of the Imperial garrison in Palestine. A combined political and military committee under the Secretary of State considered this question (Appendix 17), and arrived at provisional conclusions, which were then referred to a military committee (Appendix 18). The Conference recommended that Trans-Jordania should be constituted an Arab province of Palestine under an Arab governor, responsible to the High Conimis-sioner. On this assumption they recommended the immediate military occupation of Trans-Jordania, without which they understood that it would be impossible to secure a settled government there or to stop anti-French action initiated in the British zone. These recommendations were, however, dependent upon the attitude adopted by the Emir Abdullah, and were subsequently modified as a result of interviews^Between the Secretary of State and the Emir which were held in Jerusalem on the 28th, 29th and 30th March (Appendix 19). In the course of these conversations it became quite clear, not only that the Emir was unwilling to become governor of Trans-Jordania himself under the High Commissioner, but also that lie was not prepared to recommend a candidate for this appointment. He had himself announced his intention of taking a, leading part in anti-French action, and the people of the district were expecting him to persist in this policy. When the policy recommended by the Conference for Mesopotamia, and for Arabia generally (section V, paragraph 2) was explained to him, lie realised that for him to persist in active measures against the French would conflict with the interests of the Sherifian family and permanently alienate them from His Majesty&apos;s Government. His own suggestion was that an Arab Emir should be appointed for Palestine and Trans-Jordania, who should be in the same relations with the High Commissioner for Palestine as the future Emir of Mesopotamia with the High Commissioner for that country. It was explained to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government were already too Jar.committed to a different system in Palestine for them to be able to adopt this proposal. He reluctantly accepted this, but proceeded to suggest that Trans-Jordania should be incorporated with Mesopotamia. He was told that this was also impossible. He then agreed to do his best to keep Trans-Jordania quiet during the month which must elapse before his father and brother could be consulted about the original proposal that it should be constituted an Arab f province of Palestine. It was realised that he was being asked to undertake a very difficult task, and it was eventually suggested to him that he should make himself responsible for Trans-Jordania for the period of six months, during which time he would be assisted financially by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would also help him to organise local forces under British officers. It was pointed out to him that if he succeeded in checking anti-French action for six months he would not only convince the French Government that, so far from being actively hostile to them, [6053] C
the Sherifian family was prepared loyally to eo-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in protecting them from external aggression, and would thus reduce their opposition to his brothers candidature for Mesopotamia, but he would also greatly improve his own chances of a personal reconciliation with the French, which might even lead to his being instated by them as Emir of Syria in Damascus. It was made perfectly clear to him that while they would do everything they could to assist towards the attainment of this object, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not in any way guarantee that it would be achieved. After full consideration he agreed to undertake responsibility for Transj-Jordania for six months. He preferred that military assistance should be given him in the form of aerial support, and assistance in the organisation of local levies under British officers, and said that he did not wish troops to be sent to Amman. As an alternative to the procedure recommended by the Conference this solution appeared preferable to the Secretary of State, both on financial and military grounds, and he accordingly recommended its adoption to the Cabinet on his return to London.2. The question of the composition and recruitment of the Palestine Defence Force was discussed by a committee at Cairo (Appendix 20).The recommendations made by this committee were reviewed in the light of the political decisions taken later at Jerusalem, where further committees were called to discuss this subject (Appendix 21). The original proposal of the High Commissioner for Palestine had been to raise a Defence Force on the militia system. He considered that the duties that would fall to a Palestine Defence Force were not such as to render indispensable the training of the men up to the standard of European armies, however desirable that might be in itself. He had suggested that a training of six months, followed by six months&apos;service in their stations, and then periods of three months in each of the three following years, should suffice to provide a militia effective enough for its purpose, and numerous in proportion to its cost. Two objections were offered to these proposals. From the military point of view it was urged that a training on the militia basis would not provide a force which would be capable of taking the place of Imperial troops. From the political point of view it was pointed out that the terms of service would not appeal to the Arab in the same way that they did to the Jew, and it was feared that the result would be that no Arabs would enter the force. The alternative of enrolling the two elements of the force under different conditions-the Jews on a militia basis and the Arabs on a long-service basis was considered and rejected. It was finally decided that the same terms of service should he offered to all namely, short service of two or three years, with the option of extension to long service at the end of that period. As a result of the decision to regard Trans-Jordania as an Arab Province of Palestine, it was decided that the forces raised locally in Trans-Jordania should form part of the Palestine Defence Force.&apos; It was suggested that the Circassian element in Trans-Jordania might also be made use of for the formation of mounted troops. The High Commissioner, pointed out that the effect of these decisions would be to make the Palestine Defence Force more expensive and to preclude the possibility of its being paid for entirely from Palestine revenues as he had originally suggested. There were two possible alternatives for dealing with the financial aspect of the force. It j night either be regarded as a purely Palestine force paid for from Palestinian revenues, with the assistance of a grant in aid from Imperial funds; or it might be treated on the analogy of the British officered levies in Mesopotamia and regarded as an Imperial force to the expenses of which Palestine revenues would provide an increasing contribution. No final decision was taken on these two alternatives and the Secretary of State desired the High Commissioner to prepare a complete scheme and submit it to him for approval. He undertook that the cost of the units of the force which were raised in Trans-Jordania would in any case be regarded as an Imperial commitment for the present.3. The question of the composition of the Commission on the Holy Places referred to in Article 95 of the Treaty of Sevres and Article 14 of the draft mandate for Palestine was considered by a Committee under the presidency of Sir H. Samuel (Appendix 22), which recommended that the post of Chairman would be most suitably filled by an Englishman of judicial experience and, so far as possible, world-wide reputation. They considered that, provided the members were not local people and were chosen as much on account of their impartiality as of their religious views, the best composition for the Commission, under a British
chairman, as suggested above, would be two Christians (one Catholic and one Orthodox), two Moslems (both Sunnis) and two Jews (one Zionist and one Orthodox). Sectarian views would be laid before the Commission by panels specially selected by the respective communities, but forming no part of the Commission. The Committee agreed that the Administration should be represented on the Commission, and considered that the best way to secure this would be by the appointment of a secretary, Who would act in a dual capacity as member of the Commission and representative of the Administration. With regard to the payment of members, they recommended that this should be under-taken by the League of Nations or, failing this, by His Majesty&apos;s Government. They did not regard the functions which the Commission would perform as a Palestinian interest, and considered that no payment should be made towards it from the revenues of Palestine.4. The Secretary of State received influential Moslem and Jewish deputations (Appendix 23), and assured them both that there would be no change in the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Balfour declaration contained two distinct promises, one to the Jews and one to the Arabs; both would be fuliilled. He was convinced that the Zionist cause would bring good to the whole world and welfare and advancement to the Arabs of Palestine. He appealed to the Jews to dispel the exaggerated fears of the Arabs by a good and friendly attitude and by the exercise of due restraint as well as of enthusiasm. He advised the Arabs, on the other hand, to give help and encouragement to the Jews, whose success would bring general prosperity and wealth to all Palestinians.1. The position with regard to Aden was that the Cabinet had only approved its transfer to the Colonial Office subject to the concurrence of the Government of India in the Report of the Mastorton Smith Committee (Appendix 1). On the 21st March the Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office that so far as could then be seen the Government of India were likely to be able to accept the main recommendations of the Report in principle, subject to satisfactory financial adjustments. Any proposal to saddle India with financial liabilities for Aden on its transfer to the Colonial Office must be strenuously resisted. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, to whom this telegram was repeated, immediately informed the Secretary of State for India, that there could of course be no question of the Colonial Office accepting the transfer of Aden unless a, substantial contribution were made by India for the maintenance of Indian interests and responsibilities in Arabia (Appendix 24). It must be understood, therefore, that the recommenda-tions made by the Conference, other than those relating to the immediate reductions proposed for the garrison of Aden, are subject to a satisfactory agreement being reached on the question of financial adjustments between the Imperial Government and the Government of India.2. A Committee under the chairmanship of Major-General Sir Percy Radcliffe (Appendix 25) recommended that the present detachment at Nobat Dakim should be withdrawn in order to permit the infantry of the Aden garrison to be reduced at once to three battalions. A condition to this recommendation was that a flight of aeroplanes should be sent to Aden as early as possible, two machines to be available for use on either side of the Gulf of Aden as might be required. They also recommended that the orders already issued for the despatch of a pack battery to Aden should be cancelled ; that the squadron of Indian cavalry should be returned at once to India; that two out of the four 6-inch guns, which form the main armament of the Royal Garrison Artillery at Aden, should be laid up; and that the defence light section should be reduced to the minimum required for keeping the instruments in a serviceable condition.3. In order to ensure a further reduction in the garrison it was necessary that satisfactory relations should be established with the Imam of the Yemen (Appendix 26). The following steps were recommended for the attainment of this object: the removal of the ex-Turkish Vali, through the good offices of the Emir Abdullah ; the transmission of a friendly reply to the Imam&apos;s latest letter, which had been received at Aden at the end of February; and the despatch of a member of the Lahej family, with some intelligent ex-Turkish subject, to Sanaa with a view to preparing the way for negotiations. On the success of this mission would depend the prospect of more formal negotiations, resulting in air.   ADEN AND SOMALI LAND.[6053]D
Treaty of Alliance. The Committee were of opinion that if these negotiations were successful it would be possible to reduce the garrison of Aden to one British and one Indian battalion. The battalion of Yemen infantry should at the same time be reduced to a strength of 400 and transferred to Somaliland to take the place of the Somalis of the Camel Corps, who would be organised on a retaining fee reserve basis. Arrangements would also be made to station one company of the Aden garrison at a hill station in Somaliland, provided that a station ship of about 1,500 tons, capable of carrying GOO troops, was always available at Aden. It was pointed out that the Chief of the Air Staff was averse from permanently detaching so small a unit as a flight of aeroplanes for service in Aden and Somaliland, and that he would prefer the force to be increased to one squadron. Financial considerations would render this impossible unless the Aden garrison were still further reduced, and it was considered premature to propose any scheme with this object.4. The complete amalgamation of the Aden and Somaliland Administrations was recommended (Appendix 27). No conclusion was arrived at as to whether the Governor should be a military commander of Major-General^ rank, as hitherto at Aden, or a purely civil officer. In the event of its being decided to separate the civil and military functions and to appoint&apos; a Civil Governor, the Committee considered that the Officer Commanding troops should not be of higher rank than Colonel-Commandant. It was agreed that a separate administrator resident in Somaliland would be unnecessary under present conditions, and that in the absence of the Governor the Officer Commanding troops at Aden should administer the Government. The political and civil secretaries, the political officers in charge of districts in Somaliland and the officers in executive charge Of the towns of Aden and Shaikh Othinan would be members of the political service recommended by the Masterton Smith Committee.5. The Governor of Bombay kindly agreed to send a financial representative to discuss the financial aspect of the transfer.of Aden, but owing to the shortness of the notice given this officer was unable to reach Cairo in time for the Confer-ence, he accordingly remained at Aden to confer with the Resident, who had by that time returned. In the absence of precise information as to Aden expenditure the Conference were unable to make any financial, proposals.V-GENERAL.1. Middle East Services. The Secretary of State approved the recommenda-tions of a Committee which discussed the question of the civil services for the countries dealt with by the Middle East Department (Appendix 28). These recommendations provided for a distinction to be drawn between officers to be absorbed into the pensionable Colonial Service and those who should be offered a five years&apos; engagement on suitable terms. The latter category wras practically identical with the political service recommended by the Masterton Smith Committee. It was decided that the respective High Commissioners should submit names of individuals whose retention was desired, with details of services,-if any, to which they belonged, and recommendations specifying under which of the two categories they should fall. The Committee recommended that individuals transferred from pensionable services under other Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or under other Governments, should be enabled to carry with them the pension rights which they had already earned, and that special provision should be made for the grant of a higher rate of pension to senior officers who were not already in the possession of previous pension rights. They considered that in the event of the termination of the mandates which had been vested in His Majesty&apos;s Government steps should be taken to safeguard the rights of British officials employed in Palestine and Mesopotamia and that a clause to this effect might be inserted in the mandates. The Colonial Office would work out a scheme as soon as possible which would be communicated, through the respective High Commissioners, to the individuals concerned for comment. Meanwhile individuals should be informed that their status would remain unchanged for a period of three months.2. Subsidies. The Conference framed a comprehensive policy for subsidies to the independent rulers of Arabia (Appendix 29). This provided that the subsidy to Ibn Saud should be increased to 100,000Z. a year, paid monthly  in  arrears,  conditional  upon   his  maintaining  peace  with
Mesopotamia, Koweit and the Hedjaz. They recognised that King Hussein and Ibn Saud must be treated on the same footing, and accordingly recommended that the former should be paid a similar subsidy, con-ditional upon improvements in the pilgrimage arrangements, recognition of peace treaties, and the exercise of his influential help in maintaining order and good government in Arabian areas. In the event of satisfactory relations being established with the Imam they considered that that ruler should be offered a subsidy of 2,000/. a month. In order to control the aggression of the Idrisi against the Hedjaz and the Yemen, and thus to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to increase their influence over King Hussein and the Imam, it was proposed to offer the Idrisi a subsidy of 1,000/. a month on condition that lie preserved the peace and excluded foreigners from Asir. They also recommended a payment of 240,000 rupees a year from Mesopotamian revenues to Faliad Bey of the Anezeh and the continuance of the remission of date tax at present accorded by the Mesopotamian Government to the Sheikh of Koweit. They considered that no further payments should be made in respect of the lease of the Koweit foreshore, the appointment of a new Sheikh of Koweit being a suitable occasion for its discontinuance.3. Cross Desert Route, Railway and Pipe Line. The Secretary of State impressed upon the Conference the necessity for carrying out a far-sighted policy of Imperial aerial development in the future. One of the main air routes of the Empire would undoubtedly be that connecting Egypt with Mesopotamia and India, which would shorten the distance to Australia and New Zealand by eight or ten days. He directed that a committee should examine the possibilities of opening up a motor route across the desert from Palestine to Iraq (Appendix 30). This committee, over which Air Vice-Marshal Sir Geoffrey Sahuond presided, recommended that the route should run via Amman, Azraq and Ramadi. This line was preferable to the southern alternative running through Maan, Jauf and Baghdad, because the distance involved was shorter, the tribal conditions were simpler, and the line was in close proximity to the projected railway line from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia. Arrangements were made for a preliminary reconnaissance to be made at a cost not exceeding 10,000/., and the Emir Abdullah undertook, at Jerusalem, to co-operate in every way.Sir Arnold Wilson was consulted by Sir Herbert Samuel about the proposed railway and pipe line. He anticipated that it would not be known for three years whether the prospect of oil in Mesopotamia would justify the construction of such a line, and that two years more would be required for its completion. It was arranged that a railway representative should accompany the desert route reconnaissance party, on receipt of whose report an estimate of the probable cost would be prepared, and definite proposals would be submitted for the whole project, including the port at Haifa.4. Mandates and Anglo-Frencli Convention. Opportunity was taken of the presence of the High Commissioners for Palestine and Mesopotamia to discuss the draft mandates and the Anglo-French Convention (Appendix 31). Beyond the clause suggested by the Committee on the Middle Eastern Civil Services (see paragraph (1) above) the only modifications which suggested themselves were possible additions to the Palestine and Mesopotamian mandates respectively to deal with the administrative distinctions recommended by the Conference for the treatment of Trans-Jordania and Kurdistan. It was realised that it would be difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to suggest any addition to the mandates at so late a stage, but it was thought that in order to anticipate possible legal objections it would be advisable for legal advice to be taken on this point. As a result of a reference to the Colonial Office, additional clauses to the two mandates were drafted in London and the Secretary of State decided that, if it proved un-avoidable that some such addition should be made, these clauses should be adopted.With regard to the Anglo-French Convention, the question of the appointment of the boundary commissioner provided for in article 2 was discussed. It was decided that, as the Mesopotamian section of the boundary could not be delimited until after the hot weather, it was desirable that the delimitation should be begun from the Palestine end, and the Foreign Office were informed accordingly. They were also requested to represent to the French Government that the selection of a French Commissioner who was already on good terms with the British authorities would best serve the ends of both Governments, and the names of two French officers were submitted to them, with the request that they would approach the French Government for the nomination of one or other of them.
5. Hcdjaz Railway. The question of the Hecljaz Railway was raised at Cairo by Sir Herbert Samuel, who pointed out that some authority was required to organise the traffic on the railway, and suggested that this authority might take the form of a joint Board. The question was discussed by a committee at Jerusalem (Appendix 32), which recommended that the Hedjaz Railway, being constituted as a single wakf, and comprising the lines from Damascus to Medina and from Haifa to Deraa, should be treated as a single administration. They considered that, in so far as the territories subject to a British and French mandate were concerned, the general supervision of the line should be entrusted to Moslem representatives from these territories. There should be a Board of Control composed of these representatives, which would meet at Deraa once a quarter. The management of the line should be vested in three managers, one appointed by each of the three Governments concerned, to whom an appeal would lie in the event of difference of opinion. These managers would be responsible to the Board of Control in respect of the disposal and distribution of the properties of the railway, but in respect of management, running of trains, &amp;c, each should be responsible to his own Government. All rolling-stock belonging to the railway should be returned to it without delay. They recommend that the finances of the line should be treated as a whole, the allocation of revenues and expenditure being decided by the Board - of Control subject to the approval of the Government concerned, and in accordance with the conditions of the wakf. There should be one auditor for the whole line, nominated by the Board of Control, and approved by the three Governments. The Secretary of State decided to take the matter up with the Foreign Office on these lines on his return.VI-CONCLUSION.On the 30th March the Secretary of State left Jerusalem and returned to England, having for nineteen days been engaged in examining and discussing the Middle Eastern problem in all its bearings with the officials concerned. Both at Cairo and Jerusalem the official meetings were supplemented by private and informal discussions which were of at least equal value. Not only did the Conference work out the measures necessary to ensure an immediate and substantial reduction in Imperial expenditure, but opportunity was taken to frame a common policy for the future. Questions which would normally have involved protracted correspondence between Departments in London, and continual references to the respective authorities on the spot were settled in a few hours&apos; friendly discussion. The experiment was amply justified by its results, and when improved communications bring the various countries of Middle East into closer contact, it may perhaps be repeated with even greater advantage.o
