145titiCABINET.2835.THE COAL DISPUTE.SUGGESTED ISSUE OB1 STATEMENT EXPLAINING GOVERNMENTPROPOSAL.Memorandum by Dr. Addison.The manifesto of the Triple Allianoe issued this morning plainly shows that tho Government proposal haa not been examined with sufficient dare and is not understood.I would suggest that a statement on the following lines be issued at once -(1) The manifesto suggests that the Government proposal does not contain a fair prinoiple for the determination of wages.It is that Hno profit shall bo payable until the standard wage is satisfied&apos;1, i.e. wages are to be the first claim upon the industry and to come before profits.(2) The manifesto states that &quot;the miners have been &quot;denied the right to have their wages regulated upon a national &quot;basis&quot;.     This is not correct.    Tbe Government proposal is that &quot;the standard wage for each and evory distriot shall be &quot;determined nationally&quot;, by a national Oommittee on which there should be representatives of the coal^owners and miners in equal numbers.for a &quot;permanent wage arrangement based upon a national &quot;regulation of wages&quot;.    This is what the Government proposal provides for except that it does not accept the principle of a pool.(4) Further, the Government proposes that the National Committee shall examine wages and the division of surplus profits with a view to deciding what relation there should be between the profits of the owners and the wages paid to the miners, n (5)What i3 the prinoiple of the Government proposal?(3) The manifesto states that the miners are working
(5) In addition to all this, the Government proposes additional assistance for a time for poor districts in order to mitigate the severity of tho present industrial conditions.(Sgd.1 C. ADDISON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W*1. 14th April,- 1921..* 3&apos;.&apos;     /-*2*
