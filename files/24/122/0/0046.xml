Committee of Home Affairs(THIS document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY1 S GOVER1IMEIIT)SECRET. %C A B I 13 S T.CP, 2846.ALLQTireflTS IN KINGf5 PARK, BDIIOURGH. Memorandum by the secretary for Scotland.1.       It has recently been decided by the First Commissioner of Works that the allotments in King!s park, Edinburgh, must bo surrendered in February, 1922, and that no further extensions can be granted.    I have been in correspondence with Sir Alfred Mond on this subject.    I understand that difficulty is felt in making an exception in this case to the general principle that Royal Parks maintained at the publio expense for the benefit of the people should bo restored to their proper use as soon as possible.In view of the many representations made to me, I have con-si derod this question very carefully * and I have cone to the con-conclusion that the special circumstances justify me in asking for a decision by the Government that these allotments should, in the special circumstances, bo continued.I accept the general principle that the Royal parks are for the use of the public as a whole, and if there were any reason to suppose that the continuance of tho allotments in the King&apos;s Park curtailed to a material decree the opportunities of\the , general public for legitimate recreation, I should not fe&apos;el justified in pressing my request, notwithstanding the demand for allotments in the City and the few areas which are available to meet it.It does not, however, appear that the existence of Itho allotments in question has any such effect.   The superficial area of the Park is 648 acres.   Only 17 or&apos; 18 acres are aij present under cultivation.     They comprise 295 allotments, sit-uated In four blocks at various points on the outskirts M the -   Park.   It is admitted by the Office of Works that thoy oapa no serious inconveLdsnoe to the public, and that they involve-^no material intorforence with the use of tho park as a pleasure resort or for recreation.   They are adjacent to congested areas of the City, and form the only ground available for cultivation to the residents in those areas.Although this question has been freely ventilated in Parliament and the Press, I am not aware of any objection having been made to the continuance of the allotments&apos;&apos;3*y any section of the Edinburgh public.   On the other hand, if these allotments have to be surrendered,&apos;many allotment holders will be deprived of healtliy and useful recreation.    The prospects of allotment holders In the City after the current year aro not good.   Much of the ground now under allotments will have to bo surrendered including ground in the public parks in the centre of the City which cannot without detriment to tho publio Tbo reserved for allotments.The value of allotments an,d tho need of assisting the movement were recognised in the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919, and I feel very strongly tb&amp;t allotments should be allowed to oontinue wherever it is reasonably practicable to reserve land for that purpose.
200It is not necessary, in my view, that the Government should give a pledge that the allotments in the icing Ts park will be allowed to re^in in perpetuity, but I think that they should &quot;be allowed to remits i&apos;-rrtil it appears that they materially interfere with tUe legitimate public use of the Park.(Signed) ROBERT MUMO.Scottish Office, April 19th. 1921.
