Clynes, M.P. to thePrimo Minister._(Previous Papers - Cabinet 23(21) Conclusion B.C.P. 2776 &amp; CP. 2655).House of CoinmoLS. 27th April, 1921.Dear Prime Minister,No doubt you are aware that my colleagues are greatly concerned as to the Government&apos;s attitude towards the Report of the Select Committee on Members1 Expenses, and I am taking the liberty of sending you this letter in the hope that its contents will have some influence upon the Cabinet in ooming to a decision.We are particularly concorned about the proposal for the provision of a free railway pass between London and the \con-stituenoy.   This would bo a valuable concession but it wouidsnot operate fairly as between Member and Member, and as it can be^ oonolusivoly shown that the oost of an open pass on all railways (the privilege enjoyed by the Members of most other Parliaments) *\ would be very little groater than that of a pass between iondon and the oonstituenoy, I would urge you to consider the possibility of making tho full concession and thus put all Members upon an equal footing.   If you are in doubt as to the difference in oost I would suggest that the Railway Executive be asked for ail estimate You will know that the Companies issue traders&quot; passes at Very cheap rates, and tho State is their biggest trader.If the full concession oannot be granted I would respectfully suggest that at any rate the pass should be available between London and the constituency and London and home.   It is just as much a duty of a Momber to travel from his home to the House of Commons as it is for him to travel between the Houbo of Commons and his constituency.The second point to which I would draw your attention is that of Income Tax.   It is unfortunate that in the first in-stanoe the payment was designated salary, although you yourself stated at the time that it could not be regarded as a salary but merely payment for expenses incurred.   There is not the slightest doubt that the  100 at present allowed free from Inoome Tax does not cover the actual out-of-pocket expenses of the average Member. Of course, the London Member is advantageously plaoed as compared with the provincial Member whose home is in the country, but even the formerrs expanses exceed  100.
I sincerely hope the Cabinet will agree that a greater allowance, if not the whole  400, ought to bo made.Our Yiow is that if these two points could be met the proposal for free postage, which is a rather difficult matter, might well be dropped.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) J.R. CLIHES.Rt.Eon. 3* Lloyd George, LS.P.
