The stumbling block is still the National Pool:   the obstinacy of the miners1 officials on this point is due to thoir unwillingness to go back upon their own propaganda.   Tho majority of the rank and file aro concerned only with wages.   The delegates are reported to be somewhat lavish in their scale of living in London.There is still much recrimination re^ardin^ the breakdown of the Triple Alliance:   the actual cause was undoubtedly the obstinacy of officials who know that thoir members would not come out.   One told the Joint Executives openly that it was impossible for the Triple Alliance to function and tho sooner they recognised that fact the better.Transport workers and rail?;railwaymen have placed an embargo on the transport of coal:   in the case of the latter this applies only to coal intended for industrial purposes.Nine Nottingham railwaymon have been dismissed for refusing to handlo coal:   the Executive has adopted a   threatening attitude, but a solution is probable.Short time on the railways is causing a serious situation which might develop into a strike:   unemployment is, however, a deterrent.The special delegate meeting of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has decided to resist the owners&apos; proposals to reduce wages and a stoppage is not impossible.The communist movement is making rapid progress industrially.Ay was to be expected unemployment has assumed grave proportions:   on April 22nd the totally unemployed numbered 1,774,400, and short time workers 1.007,000.Extensive preparations have been made for May Day celebrations: as it is Sunday the demonstrations will probably be exceptionally large.
TH5 COAL CRISISApart from increasing distress the situation in the coalfields has changed little during the weak; outwardly the miners are as solid and determined as ever, but reports are beginning to oome in from South Wales, the Midlands and Lanarkshire which indioate that the older men care little about a National Pool as long as they are sure of a &quot;reasonable&quot; or &quot;living&quot; wage.   Peeling in regard to the Pool is strongest in Lancashire and Cheshire, where the miners are absolutely convinced, as the result of persistent propaganda by their officials, that unless they obtain a Pool, both of profits and wages, their future earnings will bs very seriously affected.In South Wales, Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands, outcrops are being extensively worked and the ooal sold at comparatively high prices.   Palling earth has caused the death of two miners who were working outcrops in Yorkshire.During last week the miners and owners bombarded each other with statements through the medium of the Press and various outside experts contributed to a somewhat technical discussion in the &quot;Times&quot;,   As a result the Prime Minister invited the miners and the owners to meet him in the after-noon of April 22nd.   On the same day the National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain reaffirmed the demand for a ^^tional Wages Board, a National Pool, national flat rate variations above the standard and the retention of the.principle of the war wage.   On April 24th the owners sent to the Government and the miners an amended offer for a temporary settlement for three months on an area basis.Tue proposals for a temporary settlement were asfollows
1.     That for a period of three months reductions in wages in each area shall he of uniform amount per shift worked for all workmen in the area, and shall not in * any area exceed such an amount as may be fixed by the Government, the owners and the men for each of the three months respectively.   No payment shall be made for days not worked.2.    That for each month of the temporary periodascertainments shall be made upon the basis of the durable scheme; but the owners in the aggregate in any area (a) shall not have any share in the surplus revenue of the area if the taking of such share shall have the effect of reducing the rate of wages in the previous month, nor (b) shall they have their standard profits either in whole or in part if by the taking of either the whole or part the men in their area would on the area results for the month be suffering a reduction in wages of more than the maximum fixed under paragraph 1 for the month.3.    That 1he Government shall, where necessary, make such a contribution to any area as will prevent the reduction, after the operation of 2(b), being more than the maximum amount for the month fixed under paragraph 1.4.    that the temporary period for these proposals extend to 31st July, 1921, and thereafter the wages paid in each area will depend solely upon the financial ability to pay as determined under the durable scheme.5.    for the purpose of accounting the March results in each area will be applicable to May and June, and May results to July.The wages to be paid in August under the durable scheme will be calculated by reference to the June results in each area.   No loss of sither surplus or standard profits during the temporary period will ba carried forward into August, but any net loss will be carried forward.The suggested areas were:-(l)   Scotland Fife and Clackmannan,The Lothians, -Lanarkshire and Ayrshire.(2)   Northumberland (3)   Durham (4)   MidlandsCumberland, Lancashire and Cheshire, North Wales, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, South Derby-shire, North Staffordshire, Cannock Chase, South Staffordshire and Worcester-shire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, Shropshire.Northumberland.Durham.Southern/
(5)   Southern Forest of Dean, Somerset,Bristol, and Kent.(6)   South Wales&quot;   : Soutii Wales.The owners also put forward the following proposals fora permanent settlement1.    The wages in the industry shall depend upon thefinancial ability to pay and for the purposes of the scheme the coalfields of the country shall be divided into agreed upon areas.2.    The following principles shall he adopted to determine the wages payable in each area in accordance with the financial position of the area:-(a)   Standax^d wages,for the men shall be fired as against standard profits for the owners the standard wages being the first charge on the industry.fb)   The surplus revenue&apos; of the area shall be divided between the owners and. the men.On April,26th the negotiators discussed definite wagesproposals for a temporary settlement, $he owners contended that an average reduction in wages of 5s. 4d. per shift wasnecessary to put the industry,on an eoonomio basis without government support:   the miners offered a reduction of 2s,per shift and claimed that the State should give an equivalentamount, estimated at the rate of  91.000,000 per annum.   TheGovernment suggested a reduction of 3s. 6d. per shift, thedifference to be drewn froa a subsidy \   The woriang arrangement suggested by&apos; the owners wa&apos;s that where necessary the Government contributions should make up the area difference between the economic wage and tho actual wage determined,&apos; while the owners should give up&apos; both standard&apos; and surplus profits.   *On April 27th the &quot;Government proposed&apos; that the reduction should be hot more than 3s. per shift, during a period of four months.   The Delegate Conference will consider the latest offer to-day. ; &apos;1 m*The extremists continue their activities in the coalfields
and are devoting special attention to the rebel sections of the railwaymen!and transport workers.The Executive of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwayman have instructed their members not to handle imported coal or&apos;Coal moved from colliery sidings.   The embargo has taken effect in some districts, more notably on the Clyde, but in the London docks opinion is divided owing to unemployment.   At Nottingham nine railwaymen . S have been dismissed for refusing to handle ooal and the Executive announced yesterday that &quot;it has been decided to use the whole force of the Union to secure their unconditional reinstatement&quot;.   It is added that the embargo is not placed on &quot;coal used for hospitals, for publio utility purposes or for household use: but coal intended for commercial purposes must not be moved.&quot;Robert Williams has been expelled from the Communist Party of Great Britain owing to his inaction in regard to the Triple Alliance strike.   It appears that&apos;the Communist Party had worked out a scheme by means of which it was thought&apos; &quot;Strike Committees&apos; could practically run trie essential services of the country -i or in other words - feed the &quot;proletariat,&quot;. ; This; scheme was . handed to Williams who was instructed to lay; it before the. Triple Alliance Exeoutive.   He did not do so., hence his expulsion from the party. .,J. R. Thomas., M,P., who has now. issued writs for. libel against the printers of &quot;The Communist,&quot; and against Francis Meynell has a somewhat plaintive letter, in.the current issue of the Railway Review,in which he, asks, members and branches.to withhold Judgment until they have heard his side, ofthe case.. A. J.. Coolc has announced that.the mijiers will leave the Triple Alliance; this statement has been denied but is probably only premature./&apos; On/
On April 24th the Trafalgar Square demonstration in aid of the &quot;Save the Miners&apos; Children Fund&quot; was attended by about 4,000 people; the fund is now reported to stand at  10,000.The Sxtreraist Press has raised a howl of execration ag&amp;inst the Triple Alliance and muoh of its language is not fit for reproduction.THE COMMUNISTSThe communist movement in Great Britain has made more progress during April than during the whole period since the Second Congress of the Third International in July last. Politically the Communist Party is still negligible although unemployment gives its doctrine more hold than it would have in normal times.   Industrially, however, a great change is apparent: this is due to two causes, the breakdown of the Triple Alliance and the activities of the Red International of Trade Unions, which embraces the Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Committees and the Workers&apos; Committees.   Until the Triple Alliance had actually failed under the acid test, the extremists, although they were aware of its*flaws, were loatf-to discard an instrument which had wide revolutionary possibilities.   Decontrol precipitated a crisis whioh they   , had timed for a later period, when the permeation of trades union executives by communists would have ensured a majority for revolutionary action..  The cleavage between moderate and extreme leaders is now definite and the revolutionaries&apos; path is so muoh clearer.   Efforts to dislodge leaders such as Messrs. Thomas, Tillett and Bovin have accordingly been redoubled and the rebel elements are being welded together.At/
At the moment^ommunist propaganda is most evident among railwayman and transport workers, who are being persuaded not to handle ooal in the belief that the more industry is crippled the more fertile will the soil be for the seeds of revolution.   There is undoubted evidence that the communistsl working through the Unofficial Committees are offering strenuous opposition to a settlement and are responsible for practically every case of disorder and intimidation that has occurred.A striking instance of wirepulling by the Red International of Trade Unions is the fact that the Scottish Trade Union Congress has deoided to sever oonneotion with the Amsterdam Federation and to apply for representation on the British Bureau of the Red International.On April 23rd and 24th the Communist Party of Great Britain met in conference at Manchester with the principal object of settling the Constitution and Rules to which reference was made in my report No. 94.   The Conference was attended by 163 delegates from all parts of the country, representation being on the basis of one delegate for 50 members, but not more than 1wo delegates for any one branch. Examination of the list of delegates indicates that the movement has its firmest grip in London, the West of Scotland /South Wales and Lancashire: many of the smaller branches were unable to raise the money necessary for delegates1 expenses.   All the arrangements were made and hotel bills peiil by James Crossley, a Manchester communist.   A general levy of Is. 6d. per member was made.MoManus, who presided, was elected chairman, receiving 104 votes as against 34 for William Gallaoher and 4 for Mai one Arthur MoManus stated in his opening address:-&quot;If/
&quot;If the working class wishes to get into the saddle, it must be prepared for the eventuality of the use of violence.   We are realists.   We have our minds made up that the one solution of the problem is revolution, and nothing else.   Capital is going to -** resort to any method in order to prevent it.   We shall have to resort to all the essential methods to achieve it.   Already the working olass have got the oapital class so tottering that its members are leaning against each other to prop each other up.   In its final attempt to kill the working.olass capitalism will find on the other side a fortified, relentless organisation.&quot;Kirker of the Fife miners and Vaughan, Bolshevik Mayor of Bethnal Green, respectively moved and eecondod a resolution deolaring whole-hearted sympathy with the miners &quot;who were so treacherously abandoned by the leaders of the transport workers and railwaymen&quot; and calling upon the rank and file &quot;to prepare against a repetition of this disaster by reorganising the unions on a class basis wnd with a class war polioy&quot;.William Paul moved and Walton Newbould seconded a resolution appreciating &quot;the great noble fight&quot; of the Russian working olass against &quot;the onslaughts of Capitalism&quot; and assuring the oppressed workers of Germany and other countries that tho British oomraunists &quot;will be steadfast with them in the coming world revolution.&quot;  A third resolution, passed unanimously as were the two preceding, expressed solidarity with the unemployed and urged all communists to work together for the replacement of capitalism by the Workers&apos; Republic; this was  moved by Paul and seconded by Bishop.The remainder of the conference was devoted to discussion of the Constitution and Rules of the Party.In connection with MaoManus&apos; opening speech it is not uninteresting to note that the communists hope to persuade some reservists and members of the Defence Units to refuse to give up their arms when released from service.The expenses of the Communist Party must be inoreasing rapidly; there is definite information that in one provincial town alone four officials are paid a weekly salary of  6 eaoh\,and/
and last week an extra  10 wfcg wired to an organiser in the same town and Headquarters enquired how much money was needed to pay the fines or maintenance of communists wiio had been arrested in the neighbourhood.A special emergency edition of the &quot;Communist&quot; was&apos; printed for circulation if and when the Triple Alliance strike took place; this edition was sont with special instructions to the chief organisers and has now been returned to Howard, the circulation manager.   A few copies, however, have not corns in and Headquarters are much perturbed by this fact.   Efforts are being made to secure a copy.The Left Wing of the Independent Labour Party in Coventry hes now seceded to the local branch of the Communist Party, and the latter body has taken possession of the&apos; Independent Labour Party rooms and their furniture, including 150 chairs, 40 small; tables, a billiard table and other articles.   On April 21st three Bight Wing members of the&apos; Independent Labour Party arrived to play billiards; they were refused admittance by the communists and strong language and blows were exchanged before they were forced to retreat.   The members of the Coventry Unemployed Workers&apos; Committee, with the exception of Odell and Preeoe, who belong to the Socialist Labour Party have also joined the Communist Party.Large quantities of the &quot;Communist&quot; were forwarded to the Midland branches last week and members were instructed to go amongst the railwaymen and transport workers and to giv away those oopies which they oould not sell. There is some opposition in this area to the&apos; payment of large salaries to officials:  6 weekly is thought to be sufficient but it is doubtful if the officials concerned will pay much attention to the feelings of the rank and file. The&apos;national organiser, for instance,, illustrated the iron discipline of the Party whfthe/
he wrote last week to two delegates &quot;In view of the nature of your engagements I am prepared to excuse your attendance at the conference.&quot;On April 20th the Yorkshire Divisional Council of the Communist Party held a secret meeting at Leeds.   The chair was taken by Ebury and members were appointed to form branches in Castleford, Normanton, Pontefract, Beasworth, Featherstone, Wakefiold and other colliery districts.   Shillito was appointed for Castleford.   It was decided that Ebury should not take any active part in propaganda work as he was the only person who oould deal with secret documents and if he fell into the hands of the police his arrest would upset the uhol$ organisation for Yorkshire.   This decision was already apparent at Homsworth on April 18th when Ebury failed to put in an appearance as advertised at&apos;11 a.m. or 3 p.ra:   an audience of about 1,200 people was addressed by Fletcher of Sheffield.The Shipley branch of the Independent Labour Party has turned out its Right V/ing by 40 votes to 16 and assumed the name of &quot;Independent Socialist Club&quot;; actually it is a group of oommunists.   The Huddersfield Left Wing has seceded to the Communict. Party.My correspondent reports that the Communist movement is making considerable progress in Manchester,   On April 24th two meetings were held in Stevenson Square; the first was attended by about 1,000 people and the second by 3,000. The latter was addressed by W..McLaine, who is acting as Midlands Organiser during the imprisonment of James Stewart. He dealt chiefly with the miners1 strike and in common with the other speakers made a violent attack on, the leaders of their partners in tho Triple   Alliance,,. In South Wales the Left Wing of the Independent LabourParty/
-* xo -*Party is taking steps to join forces with the localcommunist parties.   Secession has already occurred in thecase of the branch at Clydach-oh-Tawe, Swansea Valley.Of the Newport branoh, 73 opposed secession, and 61 werein favour but no definite action has yet been taken.W, Paul has been delivering his Bolshevik lantern leoture;in the South Wales ,coal field.At a meeting of the Left Wing of the Independent LaiParty held in Glasgow on April 18th the voting was:-For joining the Communist Party ofGreat Britain.......................... 105For delaying secession ......................   S3Against seoession...........................   52Only tho Anderston branch has seceded en bloc amajority in the remaining branches having decided to rernain the Independent Labour Party.TBS SCOTTISH &quot;BED GUARD&quot;In the course of the enquiry into the authorship cfthe seditious pamphlet &quot;To the Soldiers&quot;, a Glasgow commhas been raided.   In his house were found 2G&amp; live ballcartridges, 6 sticks of gelignite, 5 yards ff fuse,7 detonators, gun cotton and a number of important documeiincluding the &quot;Oath of the Red Guard    Scots section.&quot;  Thoath bears stronp resemblance to the oath.in the RedOfficers&apos; Course, which figured in the lvlalono trial, and iprobably of the same origin, although the copy seized appeto have boon mode by Jack Leckie.   The text is as follows:&quot;I . . a son of the exploited class within Capitalist Society hereby assumes the responsibility of combining with my kindred on a military basis for the purpose of establishing economic and social freedom through working-olaso dictatorship.
I ?)ledgc to bear myself honourably to undertake my duties conscientiously and to observe without hesitation Revolutionary Discipline.I pledge to direct my thoughts and actions towards the liberation of my olass, to battle in its defence and to destroy Capitalism by every military means possible.Should I fail my solemn ofcth then may the stern power of Revolutionary Justice overtake me.&quot;TRE RED mmi^SIOUlt Off TRAPS UNIONSThe finanoial controller of this movement has sent &quot;Solidarity&quot; a sum of  380, thiB being presumably the subsidy for four weeks.   Jack Tanner, the editor of this paper, left for Canada on Thursday; he carries credentials ts a delegate of the Shopv Stewards movement to the 13th Annual Convention of the Industrial Workers of the World in Chicago.Apart from the&apos;ooal fields the organisers have concentrated on railwaymen, dockers and engineers.   Harry Pollitt has disposed of 15,000 leaflets in the London area, and is about to issue a sneoial appeal to shipyard and engineering workers.united V.^RICLE workers on   April Slst some, members of the United Vehicle Workers Union took possession of the Union Headquarters, as a protest against the policy of their officials.   They withdrew the following day after the Executive Council had promised to hold an enquiry into the matters in dispute^,THE COI W:BALTH LEAGUEA meeting of delegates from vorious labour organisations in South Wales was held under the auspices of the CommonwealtLeague/
League at Cardiff on Aoril 23rd.   The speakers included George Barker, M.P., Councillor Morgan Jones and fl. L. Outhwaite, secretary of the League.   The following resolutions were carried:(l)     &quot;This conference declares that the land belongs by equal and inalienable right to all. and that its private usurpation is an infringement of common right that can no longer be tolerated. In view of the fact that millions are destined to misery unless the economic system based on land monopoly be transformed, this conference demands that the common right shall be forthwith asserted, and, that as from an appointed day the land, with all the natural resources pertaining thereto, shall be deemed to have been restored to the people and that its economic rent shall be collected by and for the people.&quot;(2)     &quot;That this conference is of opinion that the present system of placing on tho localities a large, proportion of the cost of meeting our national responsibility in the matter of education, maintenance of the poor, aged, and infirm, unemployed relief, asylums, infections, hospitals, etc, and the many optional powers given to local authorities, is unjust and oppressive, and further results in many of these urgent obligations being inadequately met, or altogether evaded, to the great detriment of the community.   This conference, therefore, demands that these charges be placed on a national fund raised by calling upon all holders of the national property, the land, and the resources of nature resident therein, to pay the economic tfent thereof to a common fund through the national exchequer, and that for administrative purposes the money so raised, should be allocated to the local authorities in proportion to the requirements of their districts as determined by population and other essential factors.&quot;On April 24th Outhwaite also addressed a public meetingat the Hippodrome, Cardiff, on &quot;Land and Unemployment&quot;.About 400 people were present.   In the course of hie addressOuthwaite said that the troubles now being experienced bythe country originated in land monopoly, and that if a labour government put into operation the principleyof the restoratioof the land in the same manner as men were conscripted duringthe Great War our prosperity would be regained.   The capital!class could not start a counter-revolution because the labour government/
Government would have the armed forces in its own   hands. The present Government was an unconstitutional one, elected at a time when millions of voters could not record their votes.   Therefore they ahould destroy such a Government, and they could do it by constitutional methods.convictions on April 33nd Tom Morris was fined  5 at Boston for insulting His Majesty&apos;s uniform and attempting to interfere with reoruiting.On April 25th four communists named Socol, Lookett, Jesson and McHugh were charged under the Emergency Powers Act at Birmingham Police Court in respeot of speeches likely to causo disaffection among the civil population. Socol was sentenced to 6 weeks and the others to two months&apos; imprisonment.   McHugh was also sentenced under Regulation 27 of the Defence of the Realm Act to four months&apos; imprisonment for being in possession of the leaflet ,fTo the Soldiers&quot;, given as an appendix to my report &apos;3o. 101.On the same day William Hall was fined  20 with the alternative of 6 weeks&apos; imprisonment at Marlborough Police Court for a seditious speech made in Hyde Park.SINN gEIN IN GREAT BRITAIN .The&apos; epidemic of window scratching has extended throughout the Metropolitan area and to some provincial . towns.   While there is no definite evidence, it is believed that the perpetrators are Sinn Feiners.   There have alsobeen/
been cases of corrosive liquid being put into pillar boxes...... ,, . ,        d ... ^ ^,The Irish Self-Determination League has held the usual meetings during the week and collections have been made on behalf of the Irish White Cross fund.   The League intends to hold a meeting in Hyde Park on May 1st, but this has no connection with the labour demonstration on that date.   It is reported that Councillor Hioherd Purcell has been appointed League organiser for London.The current issue of the &quot;Glasgow Observer and Catholic Herald&quot; contains a whole front page advertisement over the signature of J. 0&apos;Sheehan, Sinn Fein organiser for Scotland, asking for funds to prevent the partition of Ireland by the elections for the Northern Parliament.   &quot;Irish Gaels of Scotland&quot; are asked to r&amp;iso  10,000.IKBLAJBD*The militant sections are active and there seems to be&apos;   &quot; . &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;    &apos; ...some method in their attacks.   It is believed that many of the Sinn Fein leaders would welcome any reasonable offer of self-Government.   Murdering of officers and the killing of transport animals appears to be part of a settled policy.Considerable disappointment is felt at the failure of the Triple Alliance.   Great things were hoped for from a, general strike and serious trouble which would compel the withdrawal of part of the British Forces in Ireland.It. is again reported that Michael Collins is going to the Worth to take charge of Flying Columns there and organise for the destruction of the Unionist property.Attacks on individual policemen and small patrols are again on tho increase.   At KiMLkin in Galway on April 24th 14 policemen were ambushed by a large force operating   aroundtho/
tho house of a Sinn Feiner member of P&amp;rliamant, Patrick 0&apos;Malley.   The police maintained their ground all day under heavy fire and a local Roman Catholio priest was fired upon by the rebels while attending the wounded police.The Belfast boycott continues and on Aoril 23rd about 200 rebels held up and destroyed a Belfast goods train at Falkland, Co. Monaghan.The campaign against loyalists shows no sign of abatement and the murder of Protestants for alleged spying and giving information to the Crown forces is on the increase.
