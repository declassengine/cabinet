SQI&amp;JS&amp; FOa KMPLOYii^T OF SX-SSRVICk UfiS IN THii BULuDING INDUSTRY.MEMBBABDIN BY THE iilMISHM 0  L&amp;BO Uli.The negotiations for the employment of ei-Servioe men to be trained in the Building Industry are now concluded and tho National Federation of Building trades Employers propose to start the Uchemo on the 10th April.    They are anxious for full Government co-operation In aooordanoe with the assuranoe given by the Prime Minister at an interview on the 18th February with representatives of the Federation that the Scheme would be put into operation on all building work on whioh publio money is directly or indirectly expended. They have asked that the attention of all Government Departments and Looal Authorities should be drawn to this assuranoe and that the neoossary direotions should be issued to seoure their co-operation in carrying out the Soheme.Tho Government Departments concerned have been consulted in this matter and pertain conclusions have been reaohed which I doBire to bring to the notice of the Cabinet. (a) Xabour direotly employed by Government Departments.The Schomo provides that as between a private employer and an ex-Sorvioe man acoepted for employment under its provisions an agreement of service should be   entered into legally enforceable and valid for two years.   It is reoognised that Government Departments are not in a position constitutionally to enter into an agreement of service of this description but I think that in order to satisfy the undertakings given by the Prime Minister they should regard themselves as under the same/obligation
obligation to employ ox-Service men and train them undor tho provisions of the Scheme for a period of two years, if possible, as is an employer who enters into the legally enforceable agreement of service.    An Interdepartmental Conference has been held to consider this; and subjeot tc Cabinet sanction, this can bo arranged.(b) Q^ntractsb for^ Government Departments .In the oase of existing contracts I recommend that Government Departments should circularise their contractors pressing them to take on their due proportion of ex-Servioe men under tho Scheme, and I am of opinion that all future contracts should be let subject to the condition that the oontraotor is participating in the Scheme.   A. oondition of this nature is necessary in order to oomjrly with tho assuranoe given by the ifrirae Minister that in the oase of oontracts not yet entered into Government Departments would introduce a provision on the analogy of the tfair ft ages Clause to the effect that the contraot is subjoot to tho provision that the oontraotor is co-operating in the Scheme,   In oonstruing this provision it would have to be la id^ that if a contractor operating in more than one district is observing generally the conditions of the Soheme as regards his business as a whole, he would not be required necessarily to employ the requisite proportion of ex-Service men on every contract undertaken for the Government.    The Employers1 federation havo stated that the employment of ex-Service men under the Scheme will not be made a ground for a claim for the variation of contract prices and I am asking for an cxplioit assuranoe on the point.In this connection I think that a similar course should be followed to that adopted with reference to the K&apos;ing&apos;s Roll of Employers.   Tho Conference of Ministers held on the 6th April decided that save in very exceptional oircumstances all firms contracting for Government contracts to whom the/corditions
conditions for membership of the  lag1a Soil are applicable must be on the King;s itoll,   In my opinion a.similar rule should be laid &amp;o*.n that in future save in very exceptional ciroumstances ail firms contracting for Government building contracts must participate in the Scheme for the employment of ex-Service men to be trained in the Building Industry,Exceptional circumstances would cover the case of. small firms in rural districts whose ability to co-operate in the Scheme may be limited by the fact that they employ normally only very few operatives and who may be unable to enter into a 2 years1 agreement of service with ex-Service men. (c) Housing schemes,In the case of housing operations undertaken by Looal Authorities by direot labour I recommend that tho Ministry of Health and the Soottlsh Board of Health should circularise local Authorities urging them to assist in carrying out the Soheme and that the approval of direot labour schemes in future should be subject to&quot;the condition that the Local Authority shall oo-operate in the employment of ex-Service men on its housing operations.   In the ease of schemes carried out by contract I thlnx that directions should be issued that Local Authorities should fall into line with the procedure to be followed by Government Departments both as regards existing and future contracts,   I reoommend that a similar course should bo followed with regard to housing operations in connection with the Land Settlement Schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries and of tho Board of Agriculture for Scotland,I should like to have authority to intimate to the Master Builders&apos; federation that the proposals indicated above will be adopted by the Government Departments concerned.(Sgd.)   3J.J.M0NAMAUA. -Ministry of Labour, 15.4.21.*m \J wm*
