This Docuro^t is t!vo Property ofHis Britannic frs4)0 3 * y&apos; o - G 3vernmerrt.-   1SSCirculated by the Secretary, of State for India.,    ,       iff   11SECRET. //la yjew of the way in which, I have 110 doubt accurately, the Cabinet decisions of yesterday on the subject of the new Railway Bill are reported, I have no choice but to record an earnest dissent from Conclusion (/) of the decisions about the Railway Boards. I am very sorry that, when 1 am in enthusiastic agreement with the policy of the Bill, 1 should have to dissent from a recorded decision as to the arguments to be used in support of it.But I do not agree that there is unrestricted competition in coal. I do not agree that there should be no workers&apos; representation on the Boards of Management of coal mines, and 1 do believe that the recognition of the wage-earners&apos; partnership in an industry is the best answer to syndicalism and nationalisation proposals.I hope I shall not be misunderstood. It would be folly to suggest that we should complicate the very difficult light that we shall have in winning through the policy as regards Railways by even suggesting its extension to anything else at this stage. I have no quarrel with any argument that the Minister chooses to use to get his Bill through. But 1 must place on record my objections to this being the Cabinet conclusion after very little, if any, discussion.E. S. M.10th April 1021.3804-1     100 4/21
