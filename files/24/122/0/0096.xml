PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The two important developments of the week in connection with the coal dispute are the resumption of negotiations between the owners and miners under Government mediation, and the new phase which the question of sympathetic action has assumed. Conferences between miners, owners and the Government took place on the 22nd, 25th, and 26th April, and the most notable feature is the revised form of the owners&apos; proposals. With regard to sympathetic action, the executives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen have decided to instruct their members to refuse to take part in the movement of certain classes of coal. Sympathetic action of this kind is more in accord with the recognised trade union practice than the general strike method upon which the Triple Alliance was based. These new features of the situation were still developing on the 26th.The meeting of the committee established by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party, on the 22nd April, resulted only in the issue of an appeal for funds to help to relieve the distress among miners&apos; wives and children.Details are given below which illustrate the way in which the general Question of wages reductions is being treated in various industries, in particular in shipbuilding, engineering and shipping. The meeting of the National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building Industry has not been conclusive. The policy of the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers has recently been of an energetic nature, and the union have been active in a number of matters outside the sphere of the building trades proper.The conference of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation concluded at Geneva on the 22nd April. An account is given below of the annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress at Aberdeen.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. On the 15th April, in the United Kingdom, 1,622,855 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,163,048 were lodged by males and 459,807 by females. At the same date 980,856 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 469,468 were lodged by males and 511,388 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of 11.5,902 totally unemployed and 46,685 working short time. &apos; *The total, on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 22nd April was 1,774,400. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ-ment Department and are subject to revision.  , ,   , , .  ,A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 387.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in\Support of the Miners. The most important development in the situation during the past week has been the action of the executive councils of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen in issuing instructions to their members not to handle coal at colliery sidings, or coal imported as a consequence of the dispute. Transport workers employed on coaling and bunkering in the various ports have been instructed to refuse to. bunker.,any ship
taking less than her normal quantity of bunker coal in order to reacli Continental, American or Colonial coaling ports.The only action of the joint committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party, the National Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, has been to issue, on the 23rd April, an appeal to all sections of the Labour movement and to all affiliated bodies to give assistance to the &quot; Save the Miners&apos; Children Fund,&quot; which was instituted last week under the auspices of the Daily Herald.The co-operative societies in the various mining districts are working in conjunction with the county associations in order to relieve pressure on the miners&apos; funds. The Coalville Society have decided to acknowledge trading vouchers issued by the Leicestershire Miners&apos; Association to the amount of  13,500 during the next three weeks, should the duration of the dispute render this necessary, and this loan is to be repaid free of interest by the Association when the dispute has terminated. A similar policy has also been adopted by co-operative societies in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, Warwickshire and Notting-hamshire.A new feature of the situation is the granting of sums of money, either as loans or gifts, by various trade unions. The Amalgamated Engineering Union have lent  50,000 to the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, who appear already to be in financial difficulties, as they have appealed to the Barnsley Co-operative Society for the loan of  100,000. The Asylum Workers&apos; Union have offered to lend  3,000 to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. At the meeting of the executive council of the National Union of General Workers, it was decided that the members should be asked to pay a levy equal to a total payment of 3s. per member, during the present quarter, to enable the union to make a grant of  1,000 a week to the miners. Financial assistance is also being given by the Licensed Vehicle Workers&apos; Benevolent Society and the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives.A curious attitude has been adopted by the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers towards the action of the Triple Alliance in cancelling the proposed strike. At a meeting of the executive committee a resolution was passed &quot; regretting the apparent break-down of the Triple Alliance machinery as evidenced in connection with the miners&apos; dispute,&quot; and declaring that &quot;the workers concerned should appoint a Grand Jury to inquire into iis causes, in order that the working class movement may profit thereby, and reconstruct its machinery in such a way that it will be impossible to fail in its function for working class deliverance from the bondage of capitalism.&quot;United Vehicle Workers. For the whole of the 21st and 22nd April, the central offices of this union in South Kensington were in the possession of an informal committee of members of the union, numbering from 40 to 50; the officials and clerical staff were excluded, and the business of the union was suspended. The informal committee claimed to represent the rank and file of the London branches of the union, and had as their spokesman, the secretary of the south-eastern (London) district &quot; vigilant committee &quot; connected with the union. In the manifesto issued by the committee, two reasons were put forward for their action : the action of their representatives on the 15th, in voting hi favour of cancelling the projected sympathetic strike of transport workers in support of the miners, and the alleged decision of a joint committee of this union and the National Union of Vehicle Workers, at a meeting on the 20th April &quot; behind the backs of the members,&quot; to recommend the commercial road transport section of the union to accept proposals for reduced wages. The feelings of the insurgent members appear to have been aroused, however, mainly by the cancellation of 15 mass meetings in the London area which had been arranged by the officials for the night of the 15th, in anticipation of a sympathetic strike. ..As a result of a meeting between the executive of the union and representatives of the informal committee, the affair was satisfactorily settled on the 22nd, and no further trouble is expected. During the occupation the offices of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation became the rendezvous of the officials and executive. The centre of the district of the union from which the movement arose is the Old Kent Road. .Cotton Reconstruction Board.-ln view of the continued depression in the cotton textile industry, and the consequent drain on their funds, the Board have decided that the benefits payable under their scheme^ must be reduced as follows :-Men from 7s. Qd. to 6s, per week ; women from 6s. to 5s. per week ; boys under 18 years of age from 3s. Qd. to 3s, per week; and girls of like, age from 3s. to 2s. 6d. per week.  The allowances for.&apos;;&apos; v-&apos; * See. this Report?, Vol. Ill, No. 3,15th January, p. ii. (b 17282T) 3 C 2
children are to be reduced from Is. Gd. to Is. per week. These reductions are to date from the 25th April.Industrial and Other Organisations.Scottish Trades Union Congress. The 24th annual session of the Scottish Trades Union Congress was held at Aberdeen from the 20th to the 23rd April. This body differs markedly from the British Trades Union Congress. It is smaller, and its tone is more unofficial. It contains representatives, for example, of local trades and labour councils in Scotland as well as of the Scottish trade unions. The delegates at Aberdeen numbered 240 and repre-sented a trade union membership of 560,000, ,the numbers in each case being approximately the same as last vear. &apos;The proceedings were overshadowed, partly by the coal dispute, which deprived the Congress of the presence of the more notable miners&apos; leaders in Scotland, and partly by the failure of the Triple Alliance strike to materialise at the preceding week-end, the sobering effect of which appears to have deprived the gathering of all enthusiasm.Resolutions were passed expressing full support for the miners and condemning the whole attitude of the Government towards the present dispute, and in favour of nationali-sation of the mines and the railways. The resolution upon the Irish question called for the withdrawal of the &quot; army of occupation,&quot; and the summoning of an Irish constituent assembly, and thus was considerably milder than the resolution adopted by a special meeting of the Congress last year, which made an appeal to all workers to cease manufacturing and handling munitions, and to bear no part in the transport of troops intended for Ireland.The drink question gave rise to the most important division at the Congress. A resolution proposed by the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers in favour of a brighter and better public-house received 79 votes as against 64 votes for a resolution in favour of total prohibition.Other resolutions of interest upon questions of Government policy were in favour of legislation on the 44-hour week for shop assistants, and of the suspension of the 10 per cent, increase in the rents of working class dwellings, which becomes permissible after the 2nd July next.The position of the co-operative employees was discussed on resolutions instructing the Parliamentary Committee to approach the co-operative movement for the purpose of establishing machinery to settle disputes with their employees, and condemning the attitude of certain co-operative societies towards Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award.* The customary resolution was adopted approving trade union amalgamations, and also a resolution that &quot; in view of eventualities in industrial disputes, some scheme of finance, commissariat, communication and transport should be organised to protect the interests of the workers and safeguard the supply of foodstuffs.&quot;Too much importance should not be attached to a resolution instructing the Parlia-mentary Committee to apply for permission to appoint a representative to the British Bureau ot the Trade Union International Movement organised from Moscow. The resolu-tion was carried by 55 votes to 50. There was apparently some confusion in the voting, and the discussion has not been reported by the Press.The annual session of the Congress for 1922 will be held at Inverness, under the presi-dency of Mr. Gallie, of the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, who succeeds Baillie James Walker, , of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.Co-operative Union. A special national conference, convened by the Co-operative Union to consider the report and recommendations of the &quot; Income Tax Committee &quot; with regard to the Corporation Profits Tax, was held at the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 19th April, under the presidency of Alderman F. Hay ward, of Burslem, and was attended, by 850 delegates. The committee recommended that they should &quot; be empowered to suggest to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the adoption of one of the following alternatives:- &apos;(1) The abolition of all direct taxation on trade such as the Excess Profits Duty and Corporation Profits Tax, and, in their stead, reliance upon income tax, super-tax and death duties. (2) The abolition of the Corporation Profits Tax and the substitution of a tax on net turnover after deducting all payments by way of discounts, bonuses and dividend on purchases.. (3) If the Corporation Profits Tax be retained, it should be recognised.in all taxation that the surpluses of co-operative societies arising from mutual trading are not profits, and the consequent exemption of such surpluses.&quot;* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p. 315, and Vol. Ill, No. 15, 9th April, p. 333.
An amendment was supported by 28 societies, including those of Liverpool, London, Manchester and Salford, which rejected the second of these recommendations and recommended all members of the Co-operative Union, inter alia, &quot; to refuse to pay the Corporation Profits Tax, or any other form of taxation that affects the principle of mutual trading.&quot; This amendment, after considerable discussion, was rejected by 1,688 votes to 1,179,* and a resolution &quot; that inasmuch as we consider the Corporation Profits Tax to be an infringement of the principle of mutual trading, . . . societies resist the tax to the utmost limit of the law &quot; was agreed to without discussion. The first and third recom-mendations were ultimately adopted, but the second was rejected by a substantial majority. . : The conference also adopted a resolution recording tf its emphatic protest against the action of the Treasury in proscribing the admission of our specially trained accountants to the list of public auditors, if they are not members of one of the Institutes of Chartered Accountants ... or of the Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors,&quot; and calling upon the Government &quot; to withdraw these offensive and unfair regulations.&quot;Scottish Building Trades Organisations.-Important developments appear to be talcing place in the relations between the organisations in England and Scotland representing employers and workpeople in the building trades.Attention has already been drawn in this report to discussions between the Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers), the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Association, and the National Federation of Building Trades Fjinployers on the question of a claim for an advance in wages in October last by the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives&apos; Wages and Conditions of Service Board. It is now reported that the two Scottish employers&apos; organisations are parties to the proposed National Wages and Conditions Council and Working Rule Agreement which has been prepared by the national organisations of both employers and operatives in the building trades. It may be anticipated, therefore, that, if the agreement is finally adopted at a meeting of the employers&apos; and operatives&apos; representatives, on the 6th May, wages variations in the Scottish building trade will in future be in accord with similar variations in England and Wales.On the operatives&apos; side, the Building Trades of Scotland Operatives Wages and Condi-tions of Service Board, referred to above, which has co-ordinated the action of the Scottish trade unions during the last few years, has now been dissolved, and the unions have become affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives,! a Scottish district council of the federation having been established to deal with matters in Scotland. At the same time, a joint sub-committee of the Building and Monumental Workers&apos; Union and the Amalgamated Union of Building Trades Workers has been set up to negotiate an agreement between the two unions, which, it is hoped, will bring to an end demarcation disputes which have not been infrequent in Scotland between the masons&apos; and the bricklayers&apos; crafts,International Relations of Labour.International Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The Congress of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation was held at Geneva from the 18th April to the 22nd April. The, British transport workers were represented by Messrs. Ernest Bevin, Ben Smith, Cotter and Maynard; and Mr. Tom Shaw, of the General Union of Textile Workers, was also present. A resolution was passed at the first session, declaring that the most effective weapon against militarism was the organised strength of the trade/union movement, and it was decided that a certain sum of money should be set aside for pur-poses of propaganda against militarism. At the second session, resolutions Were adopted demanding universal free trade, and the removal of all protective tariffs, embargoes and controls on the exchange of commodities between countries.  Two commissions were&quot;appointed, the first to consider measures for bringing about the socialisation of the means of transport, and the second to report on the admission of unions representing post office, telegraph and telephone workers to the Federation.- At the last session, a resolution was unanimously carried &quot; calling upon European and American transport and railway workers to refuse all labour service for the transport, shipment or handling of coal likely to be sent to Great Britain during the present locWttt of mine-workers.&quot; The secretary to the Federation stated that notices had been sent out to the transport workers in various countries to cease shipping coal to London, and the. Dutch and German workers had promised to support the Federation.* The basis of the voting was one vote for each thousand members, or part thereof, in the case of delegates from societies, and one vote for the delegate from each district association of the union, f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 2, 8th January, 1921, p. 26. J See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. i, 22nd January, p. 73.
NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National). Prolonged meetings of the newly formed National Wages and Conditions Council for the Building Trades were held in London on the 21st and 22nd April.It is understood that a statement was made on behalf of the National Federation of Building Trade Employers proposing a reduction in wages so as to leave a 25 per cent, difference between mechanics and labourers, and a 12^ per cent, difference between painters and mechanics, together with an extension of working hours to 50 per week. To this proposal representatives of the operatives replied that the general conditions promised to the workers did not warrant the reduction. They also opposed an extension of working hours.  The Council finally adjourned until the 5th May.Engineers (National). A conference, presided over by Sir Allan Smith, M.P., was held on the 21st April, in London, between representatives of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the Amalgamated Engineering Union and kindred organisations, to discuss reductions in wages proposed by the employers.* It was repre-sented on behalf of the men that the proposed reductions were not warranted, having regard to the rate of wages paid to workers in other trades which did not require equal or higher skill. It was further claimed that the rate of remuneration paid to the skilled engineers was not commensurate with the value of the engineering products to industry generally. Several other points for the men were put forward, and the conference was adjourned until the 28th April, to enable the employers to consider the men&apos;s side of the question.With regard to the above conference, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and kindred organisations met on the 22nd April, and adopted two resolutions, as follows: (1) &quot; That this conference of representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, National Foundry Workers, and the National Federation of General Workers, having heard the reports of tho representatives of the various organisations concerned in the negotiations with reference to the demand of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations-namely, a reduction in the wages of the workpeople in the employment of federated firms of 6s. per week in the case of time-workers and 15 per cent, in the case of piece-workers, together with 12  per cent, on earnings in the case of time-workers and 1\ per cent, on earnings in the case of workpeople working under systems of payment by results agreed that the representatives of the said organisations do not commit themselves to a joint recommendation with the employers to reduce wages, and that a further meeting of the said representatives be held. Further, that it be an instruction to the body responsible for the conference to convene a further conference to consider the matter.(2) &quot; That having heard the statement of the attack made on womon&apos;s wages by the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federations, this conference is of the opinion that, if the reductions are insisted upon, they will reduce the position of women employed in the industry to sweating conditions that would be a shame to our social life, and request the male members of the trade unions to render all practical help and sympathy possible.&quot;Shipbuilders (National). It is understood that the decision reached at the conference at Carlisle on the 19th April, between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, respecting the withdrawal in two instalments of the 1920 advances, f are almost certain to be duly ratified by the members of the unions concerned.  The result of the men&apos;s ballot is expected on the 29th April.It is reported that shipbuilders at Belfast generally agree to the employers&apos; proposals to reduce wages, but they declare that they will oppose&apos;the withdrawal of war advances even if these are withdrawn in England and Scotland. A conference will be held to discuss the matter this week.Transport Workers (Lancashire).-The Lancashire federation of local transport associa-tions have given notice that oh the 1st May the last advance of 7s. will be withdrawn, or, as an alternative, one hour per day longer shall be worked. This has been communicated to the unions concerned, namely, the United Road Transport Workers&apos; Association of England, and the United Vehicle Workers. A mass meeting of the members of the United Vehicle Workers was held on the 21st April, when, it is reported, a resolution was passed against any &quot; sectional &quot; action, presumably as contrasted with &quot; national &quot; action.Shop Assistants (London). A joint committee has been set up to formulate a common policy for the employees of London wholesale and retail distributive firms in resisting threatened wages reductions. -* See this Keport, Vol. Ill, No. 16,16th April, p. 347.f These advances were granted by Industrial Court Award No. 181, dated the 10th March, 1920.
This committee includes representatives of such diverse unions as the National Union of General Workers, the Electrical Trades Union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Amalgamated Tailors and Gfarment Workers&apos; Union, the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers, the Workers&apos; Union, the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers, and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.A conference of representatives of these unions was held in London on the 18th April, when a resolution was passed pledging resistance to any attempt at reductions in wages, by any means which might prove effective.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). The following is an outline of the main developments of the week, directly affecting this dispute.In accordance with their decision of the 16th April, the miners&apos; executive met on the 21st April. Mr. Hodges announced that reports from the various districts showed that the men were standing firmly by the principle of a national wages board and a national pool.The delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation met on the 22nd, and adopted the following resolutions; . (1) That this conference expresses its complete confidence in the secretary, Mr. Hodges, and the executive, in the way in which they have, and are, conducting the miners&apos; case.(2) That this conference, having fully considered the circumstances surrounding the failure of the other two sections of the Triple Alliance to put into operation their decision to strike in our support on Friday last, and a full report having been given of what transpired at the meeting of M.P.&apos;s addressed by Mr. Hodges at the House of Commons, the delegates emphatically protest against the official explanation of the other two sections, attributing their defection to the refusal of the miners executive to meet the coalowners again at the invitation of the Prime Minister. Over and over again, before and after the Triple Alliance had arrived at their decision to strike, it had been made quite clear that it was impossible for the miners&apos; executive to accept a settlement except on the terms of the concession of a national wages board and a national pool. The real cause for the sudden, unexpected, and unjustifiable withdrawal of the other two sections of the Alliance must be looked for in the character and structure of the Triple Alliance itself.The important decision of the conference, however, was to authorise their executive to accept an invitation from the Prime Minister to meet him and the owners during the day. It was laid, down that there must be no giving way on the fundamental points at issue.The meeting between the owners and the miners therefore took place at the Board of Trade on the afternoon of the 22nd April, under the presidency oi the Prime Minister, who appealed to both sides to sit down together and investigate the question of actual wages. After some discussion the conference was adjourned until the 25th, it being arranged that in the meantime the coalowners should prepare and submit a paper showing in greater detail the effect of their proposals upon the remuneration of the miners and their own profits. On the 23rd. the miners&apos; Delegate Conference approved the proposed resump-tion of negotiations.On the 25th, therefore, the joint conference was resumed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer presiding in the absence of the Prime Minister.The owners presented proposals outlining, firstly, a &quot;durable scheme,&quot; and, secondly, a &quot; temporary arrangement for transition period.&quot;The most important difference between these schemes and the owners&apos; previms proposals is the substitution of&quot; areas&quot; for &quot; districts&quot;. Six areas are proposed, namely, Scotland, Northumberland, Durham, Midland, Southern and South Wales.* The &quot; tem-porary arrangement for transition period &quot; is to exist until the 31st July, 1921, and provides that (1) The reduction in wages in each area shall be of uniform amount per shift worked for all workmen in the area, and shall not in any area exceed such an amount as may be fixed by the Govern-ment, the owners and the men, for each of the three months respectively. No payment shall be made for days not worked.(2) For each month of the temporary period ascertainments shall be made upon the basis of the &quot; durable scheme,&quot; but the owners in the aggregate in any area (a) shall not have any share in the surplus revenue of the area if the taking of such share shall have the effect of reducing the rate of wages in the previous month; nor (b) shall they have their standard profits, either in whole or in part, if by the taking of either the whole or the part the men in the area would, on the area results for the month, be suffering a reduction in wages of more than the maximum fixed under paragraph 1 for the month.* These areas are identical with those constituted by the Mining Industry Act, 1920, except that Ireland is omitted.
(3) The Government shall, where necessary, make such a contribution to any area as will prevent the reduction, after the operation of 2 (b), being more than the maximum amount for the month fixed under paragraph 1.(4) After the 31st July, 1921, the wages paid in each area will depend solely upon the financial ability to pay as determined under the &quot; durable scheme.&quot;(5) For the purpose of accounting, the March results in each area will be applicable to May and June, and the May results will be applicable to July. The wages to be paid in August under the &apos;: durable scheme &quot; will be calculated by reference to the June results in each area. No loss of either surplus or standard profits during the temporary period will be carried forward into August, but any net loss will be carried forward.After discussion, the negotiations were resumed on the 26th, when figures were produced showing a largely increased deficit on the mines during the month of March. The conference was further adjourned until the 27th, on which day the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to meet first the miners and later the owners.A national delegate conference of the General Federation of Colliery Firemen&apos;s, Examiners&apos; and Deputies&apos; Associations of Great Britain was held in London on the 23rd April when full reports were received as to the position of coal deputies throughout the kingdom, showing that a considerable number are still at work in the collieries acting as safety men, although a larger number are standing down for various reasons. A general discussion took place on the question of deputies withdrawing their labour from the mines, and the matter is to be considered further by the various districts, after which it is probable that a further conference will be called.A deputation from the Federation visited the Mines Department on the night of the 25th April to discuss the position of safety men and their relation to the wages negotiations now in progress, and a meeting between representatives of the &quot;Federation and the Mining Association is to be held on the 27th.Electricians (Scotland). This dispute still continues. The employers&apos; association, namely, the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland, and the Electrical Trades Union, appear to be waiting upon the conclusion of the negotiations between the National Federated Electrical Association and the English branches of the Electrical Trades Union.*Fisherman (Various Districts). In the fishing industry disputes arising out of proposed reductions in pay are in progress on the Tyne, at Hartlepool, and at Scarborough.On the Tyne, negotiations have been proceeding between the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union and the Tyne Steam Packet Provident Society, but at a conference at North Shields negotiations broke down, the owners&apos; offer being refused by the men, who ceased work on the 23rd April. At Scarborough, the men refused the owners&apos; proposals, and ceased work on the 11th. At Hartlepool, the men ceased work on the 18th, refusing the offer of an extra week&apos;s work at existing rates, during which time negotiations could have been carried on. The men here are organised by the National Union of British Fishermen, who appear to be resisting reductions on a national basis.At Aberdeen a conference was held on the 15th April between the Aberdeen Trawl Owners&apos; Association and the trade unions concerned. The owners&apos; proposals were submitted to the officials of the unions, who refused to accept them until the matter had been thoroughly discussed by the operatives affected. Small committees have been formed for this purpose, and another conference will be held at an early date.The reductions of wages and revised conditions for the industry proposed by the Hull Fishing Vessels Association, Ltd.,f are being strongly opposed by the trade unions con-cerned and their members.Settlements and Agreements.Seamen (National).-The National Maritime Board met at the Hotel Cecil on the 17th March, to consider the proposals of the shipowners&apos; side of the Board, for a reduction in the wages of all grades of employees at sea.J Mr. Havelock Wilson proposed that con-sideration of the whole question should be adjourned for a month, and this was agreed to after the employers&apos; and men&apos;s representatives had considered the position separately.The Board therefore met on the 22nd April, and, after a full discussion, the seafarers&apos; representatives agreed to recommend their constituents to endorse the following settle-ment, which was accepted by the shipowners : &quot; (1) That the rates of pay on monthly vessels be reduced by  2 10s. per month in the case of vessels signing articles on or after 6th May, 1921.&quot; (2) That the wages on weekly vessels be reduced by 8s. 6d. per week to take effect from the same date.&quot; &apos;__....................$ A conference between the latter bodies on the 21st and 22nd April is reported. .,  f See; this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 15, 9th April, p. 333.j For the shipowners&apos; proposals, see this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 11,12th March, p. 248.
(b 17282T)3PIt was also agreed that the rates and conditions of overtime and &quot; runs &quot; should be revised. This revision was entrusted to the respective panels for settlement within one month. The question of the practicability of forming a scale for the permanent regulation of seamen&apos;s wages on an agreed basis was referred to a committee of 9 representatives from each side of the Board.The reductions in pay provided for in the above agreement are considerably smaller than those originally proposed by the owners. Before these decisions were arrived at, Mr. J. Cotter, of the National Union of Ships&apos; Stewards, Cooks, Bakers and Butchers, intimated that they declined to be bound by any decision of the meeting, and withdrew, accompanied by other representatives of his union. The Association of Coastwise Masters, Mates and Engineers also decline to be bound by the settlement.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 384 to 386.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.engineering, shipbuilding and allied trades.Electrical Cable Making-The Industrial Council met on the 20th April. Reports were received from the trade unions on the enforcement of agreed Council rates of wages on manufacturers who are not members of the Cable Makers&apos; Association. It was reported that four of these firms have now agreed to pay the Council rates, and that a fifth has been supplied with a copy of the Council agreements. The Council decided to write to the department asking them to take action in the case of the Leeds Corporation, and to point out to the Town Clerk the dangers of ignoring Industrial Council agreements in accepting tenders for local contracts. It was further decided to place the Councu s view on the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons before the department.On the motion of the Electrical Trades Union it was agreed that rates for plumber-jointers and jointers&apos; mates on the North-East Coast in the electrical cable-making industry should be raised by 12i per cent., in order to bring them into line with the rates agreed upon by the North-Eastern District Council of the Electricity Supply Industry. The employers&apos; proposal that the future means of reducing wages should be referred to the consideration of the Negotiating Committee was agreed to by the trade unions.Surgical Instrument Makers (Walton-on-Thames). The dispute between Messrs. Claudius Ash, Sons &amp; Co., Ltd., and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, was considered at the meeting of the Surgical Instrument Joint Industrial Council on the 14th April. The employees&apos; side of the Council stated that over 50 members of the union had refused to accept the proposed reduction in wages, and that unless a settlement was reached no members of the union would be allowed to accept employment with the firm. The employers&apos; side intimated that the firm had confirmed their resignation from the association. In the circumstances the Council felt they were unable to take any useful action. The union requested the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, to take up the case, and repre-sentations were made to the firm, with the result that the manager has agreed to consult his directors as to the desirability of meeting the union again;woodworking and furnishing.Vehicle Building (Scotland). The workers at Dundee have accepted the terms relating to Scotland in the Leeds agreement of the 1st April.*  Work was resumed on the 25th April.At Aberdeen the Scottish organiser of the union requested the intervention of the department. The Chief Conciliation Officer endeavoured to arrange a joint conference. The employers, however, were only prepared to meet the unions if they accepted the reduc-tion of 2\d. per hour. It is understood that the Scottish organiser of the union is again endeavouring to find a way out of the deadlock.Sawmillers (Dublin). The arbitrator appointed in respect of the difference between the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists, the Irish Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and the Workers&apos; Union, on the one hand, and the Dublin Saw-millers&apos; Association and the Native Timber Merchants&apos; Federation on the other, held that, with regard to the claim for a reduction in wages in the native timber industry, the wages paid were so moderate, when compared with comparable rates paid in other industries, and when considered with reference to the requirements of a decent standard of living for the worker, that he did not see his way to award that they should be reduced. If they are incompatible with a&quot;continuance of the industry, the necessities of the case may have to be faced by both parties, who may by a free agreement reduce wages below the level which an arbitrator would feel justified in imposing on the workers by an award. Wages in the Dublin sawmilling industry would be reduced by the following amounts :  operatives, Id. per hour on and from the first pay-day in May, and a further \d. per hour, on and from the first pay-day in June; labourers, \d. per hour on each of the above-mentioned dates.  A claim for extension of hours was not established._* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No, 15, 9th April, p. 334,

With reference to the demand of the National Union of Quarry Workers and Sett Makers for an increase in wages of 15 per cent, for quarrymen employed by the Glasgow and West of Scotland Quarry Masters&apos; Association, and the owners&apos; claim for a corresponding decrease, it is now reported that the union, as a result of a ballot, decided to withdraw their members as from the 22nd April. The Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to arrange a conference.Freestone Quarrying. In September, 1920, the unions concerned in the freestone industry in the Yorkshire area submitted an application for an increase of wages, at the first meeting of the Yorkshire Area Council. The employers countered this with a pro-posal to decrease wages by 5d. per hour to labourers and id. per hour to masons and other quarrymen. When the claim of the operatives was refused, they insisted that the matter should be held over until the Sectional Council was set up, and that the employers&apos; counter-demand could not constitutionally be considered until the National Council had arbitrated on their claim. Consequently the Freestone Sectional Council was brought into operation in March. A special sub-committee agreed, on the 19th April, to recom-mend a reduction of &apos;kl. per hour on the 1st May, with a sliding scale similar to that pro-posed in the building trades. Building trade rates have been obtained since the war, partly owing to the shortage of masons, and largely owing to the efforts of the Operative Society of Stonemasons, who have extended the scope of their union to include quarrymen. The interesting points of this recommendation are that apparently the unions are still in a position to insist upon building trade rates, and that the employers&apos; attempt to introduce wider differentiation as between masons, quarrymen and labourers has, for the present, been abandoned.Clay Industries. The adjourned meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was resumed at Montagu House on the 22nd April, to consider the employers&apos; proposal that wages for adult male workers should be reduced by 10s. per week. At the previous meeting it had been decided to extend the current agreement until the 30th April, in order to allow the workpeople&apos;s representatives to consult their executives and their rank and file. The employers put forward an amended proposal for a reduction of 8s. per week. The workers&apos; side, however, insisted that there should be no reduction. The employers would not agree to the proposal of the workers&apos; side that the matter should be referred for arbitration to the Industrial Court, but asked whether a reduction of 6s. per week all round would be acceptable. The workers, however, would not abandon their demand for arbitration, and the meeting terminated without any agreement. A further meeting will be held on the 28th April.food and drink.Scottish Baking. At the meeting held on the 19th April, counter-proposals in respect of the new National Agreement were submitted by the employers&apos; side. The operatives desired to consider these proposals privately, and the meeting was accordingly adjourned until the 26th April.textiles.Silk.-The Industrial Council met at Manchester on the 20th April. The Macclesfield district wages agreement, dated May, 1920, is in process of revision, and, at the request of the workers&apos; side, the Council appointed mediators to assist the parties in reaching a settlement.Wool (and Allied) Textiles. Consequent upon the fall of the cost-of-living index figure to 133, the cost-of-living wages of operatives in the wool textile industry will be reduced as from the first pay-day in May in the proportion of 145 to 135. The amount of the reduction is approximately 2s. to 2s. bd. a week for women, and, for men, from 2s. Qd. to 4s. Qd., with an average of about 3s. Id. a week. This is the fourth successive month in which the cost-of-living wages have been reduced by 10 per cent, in accordance with the operation of the sliding scale agreement.public authorities and public utility services.&apos; Electricity Supply. The National Council met on the 22nd April. A draft constitu-tion for works committees, drawn up by the Executive Committee, was considered, and it was decided that the draft should be circulated to the District Councils for comment before final approval.(b 17282t) 3D 2
30.4.21,386Industrial Relations Department-continued.government departments.Admiralty. The first meeting of the Council, consequent upon the re-acceptance by the unions of the Whitley Scheme for Government Industrial Establishments, was held on the 22nd April. The Civil Lord presided. In view of the depression in the engineering and shipbuilding trades, the trade union side urged that some proportion of the heavy discharges that were taking place in the dockyards should be postponed to the latter end of the financial year, when the condition of trade might afford a better prospect of the re-absorption of the men in private industry. The Admiralty representatives promised that this representation should receive sympathetic consideration.It was decided that a special meeting of the Council should be held on the 6th May, to dispose of the business that was under the consideration of the Council at the time of the suspension of their proceedings, and that the next ordinary meeting should be held on the 27th May.miscellaneous trades.Tailors and Tailoresses (London). The West End tailors&apos;strike still continues, and there is no sign of any immediate settlement. The department have been in touch with both sides. The London employers&apos; association have joined with the Association of London Master Tailors and the National Federation of Merchant Tailors. At a mass meeting of the three associations, on the 21st April, it was unanimously resolved that the terms of the employers&apos; first offer should be revised, and that a 15 per cent, reduction should be proposed. The widening of the scope of the reduction has brought about a more serious position, and it is significant that, since the London employers&apos; association have come into the dispute, the objection of the employers to arbitration seems to have been strengthened.Gas Mantles.-The Industrial Council met on the 18th April, when a representative of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers moved that a petition be addressed to the Government for the inclusion of the gas mantle industry in the proposed Ways and Means Resolution. He suggested that 3,000 copies should be printed and distributed by individual firms to their employees, who would be requested to obtain as many householders&apos; signatures as possible. This was agreed to. The terms of a letter addressed to members of the National Gas Council by the secretary of that body, urging them to take steps, through members of Parliament, to oppose protection, on the ground that imported gas mantles were better and cheaper, were strongly objected to by members, who pressed that the matter should be taken up immediately. It was resolved to call for the immediate withdrawal of the statement, and to publish a copy of the circular and reply of the Council thereto in the trade papers.Glass. The Industrial Council met on the 19th April, and discussed the appointment of a paid secretary and the amendment of the constitution. A deadlock was reached on the question of the secretaryship owing to the attitude of the unions, who were unable to agree to the expenditure involved. It appeared at one time that the Council would break up, but it was ultimately decided to refer the question again to the Executive Committee, who will try to find some solution of the difficulty.Rag and Waste Workers (Deptford). As a protest against reduction of rates proposed by Messrs. J. &amp; A. Dandridge, the male and female employees ceased work in March. Various efforts have been made to bring about a settlement, but the employers refused to modify their original proposals, and these, the union maintained, were unacceptable. Finally, however, at a conference of the parties held under the auspices of the department, an arrangement was arrived at, that carmen&apos;s wages should remain as they are for three months, workmen other than carmen to he paid 65s. per week, and women of 18 and over 36s. per week, with proportionate rates for those under 18. These rates involve a reduction of 5s. and 2s. respectively. This agreement is to continue in force for three months from the 25th April.The union accepted the terms on condition that the firm would meet two of the shop stewards before resumption, to settle priority of engagement at the present juncture. The firm agreed to meet the workers&apos; representatives.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 376 to 379, 387 and 392.]\
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.proceedings.Laundry Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered the minimum rates for female workers as varied at their meeting on the 12th and 13th January. It was resolved, by the votes of the appointed members and the representatives of workers against the votes of the representatives of employers, to re-affirm the minimum rates as varied at the previous meeting, and to inform the Minister that, both before varying the minimum rates in January, and again on the present occasion, the point as to differential rates had received the fullest consideration.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain).-T\\e Board decided to vary overtime rates for male and female workers in accordance with the Proposal dated the 4th January.The Board decided to issue a Proposal to fix general minimum time-rates, guaranteed time-rates, general minimum piece-rates and overtime rates for male and female appren-tices to cigar making, and to fix general minimum piece-rates and guaranteed time-rates, and to vary overtime rates, for male and female apprentices to cigar sorting and bundling.The Board considered the position of juvenile workers in the trade, and decided to send a circular letter to all firms in the trade, recommending that the practice of engaging juvenile labour without prospect of permanent employment, and the consequent dismissal of juvenile workers when they become adult, are undesirable, and should be discouraged by employers&apos; organisations as well as by trade unions.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 21st April, to vary general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for female learners, other than female learners employed in any branch of the whole-sale and retail cloth hat and cap trade.Linen and Cotton ErnI)roidery Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 18th April, to fix general minimum piece-rates for female workers engaged in nickelling and top sewing French corners on handkerchiefs.EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.employment exchanges.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 15th April: 	Men.

Employment and Insurance Department-continued.General Outlook. Reports show a further substantial increase in unemployment, It would appear, however, that, apart from iron and steel and other large coal-consuming industries, no very large general discharges have occurred, and there is evidence that manufacturers generally are endeavouring to keep their workpeople employed, if only on rationed time, until stocks of coal are exhausted. A decided improvement in the cotton industry is reported from the North-Westeru Division, where mills are working full time in the few towns where a supply of fuel is still available, A few of the London, South Midland and South-Western districts report an improvement in the dressmaking, tailoring and boot trades, but these activities are more than counterbalanced by the serious effects of the coal dispute on the metal, pottery, brick and hosiery industries. The principal alterations in the position during the week are noted below7.Metis Employment.Iron and Steel. In Scotland, Messrs. Wm. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd., Motherwell, have closed down their Mossend works, employing between 1,800 and 2,000 men, and of the 580 men employed by the Motherwell Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., 160 are unemployed, and tin1 remainder are working on short time. At Coat-bridge unemployment in iron, steel and tube works is increasing rapidly. On the other hand, Sir William Arrol &amp; Co., Ltd., Bridgetown, engineers, are starting full-time working and expect to be busy for some considerable time, and in the Falkirk area all ironfoundry establishments are still working.In the Northern Division, at Blaydon, two firms of ironfminders and a fireclay firm contemplate closing down within a few days. At Hartlepool, two of the largest firms in the district have only sufficient coal to last about eight days, and at West Hartlepool, foiu&apos; large firms, employing approximately 3,000 men, have closed down entirely. Of the 1,900 men on the registers at Thornaby, nearly 800 are from a firm of ironworkers. Most engineering firms at Darlington are carrying on under difficulties, and further suspensions are expected daily.In the Sheffield district the situation has taken a decided turn for the worse during the week ; 1,200 men have been suspended from the Siemens and Tyre Mills of Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co.; Ltd., 400 from the Newall Works of Messrs. Hadfield, Ltd., 100 from the works of Messrs. Ho well &amp; Co., Wincobank, and 200 from Messrs. Brown Bayley&apos;s Steel Works. Further discharges of approximately 1,000 men are expected from the tube works of Messrs. Howell &amp; Co., at the end of the week. On the other hand, at Barnsley, Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., Ltd., have decided to re-start 400 of the 1,600 men employed at their rolling mills. The Stanton Iron Works, Ilkeston, have also partly resumed work at their foundries, to the extent of absorbing some 300 of their workmen. In the North-Western Division, at Crewe, the London and North-Western Railway Co. have been compelled to shut down their smelting furnaces, employing some 800 men.In the West Midlands Division it has been decided to close down two ironworks at Bilston employing some 400 workmen, and at Selly Oak, Messrs. F. E. Bakers, Ltd., Precision Works, and Messrs. Clifford &amp; Sons, Ltd., have suspended work. In South Wales, where the majority of steel and tinplate works are idle, distress among the workers is becoming increasingly acute.In the South Midlands and Eastern Division Messrs. Ransomes, Sims and Jefferies, Ltd., Ipswich, engineers, employing 3,000 men, have closed down for an indefinite period, and at Peterborough, 800 workpeople are affected by the closing down of the engineering works of Messrs. P. Brotherhood, Ltd.Shij)building and Allied Industries. On the Clyde, discharges from the shipyards continue to be heavy, but this is due to general slackness of trade rather than to the coal stoppage. At Dundee, notices have been posted in the various yards to the effect that the works may go on short time, or close down entirely, at a clay&apos;s notice. On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, there is a decided slackness in ship-repairing work, but most shipyards are expected to be able to keep going for some little time with present staffs.On the Mersey, employers are retaining the services of all the workpeople they possibly can, but, as the majority of jobs last only a few days, dismissals are heavy. In South Wales the only change is reported from Swansea, where more work for boilermakers and. helpers has been available during the week. At Avonmouth. the outlook is brighter, a number of ships having arrived for repairs.Textiles and Clothing. In the woollen textile trade, notwithstanding the shortage of coal, most mills are continuing to run on short time. At Batley, the position has improved on the receipt of a fewr small orders, but. at Dewsbury the rag trade is practically at a
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.standstill. The depression in the lace trade has been aggravated by the coal stoppage, and the improvement which was believed to be rapidly approaching has received a set-back. No stoppages on a large scale, however, have occurred during the week.Employment in the hosiery trade is slacker, and at Leicester, Messrs. Wolsey, Ltd., have been compelled to close down. Coal stocks at hosiery and other factories in the Sutton-in-Ashfield district, however, are said to be sufficient to keep the mills going for s jme considerable time.In the boot and shoe trade, conditions at Northampton are being adversely influenced by the coal stoppage. Many orders have been cancelled and others postponed, while the limitation of power has reduced the working time of one factory to three days per week. At Stafford the position is good and the majority of firms are still working full time.Reports from cotton centres in the North-western Division are again encouraging. It is clear that the revival has at last actually commenced, and that, immediately the coal difficulty is disposed of, a return to full-time working in some mills is very probable.Miscellaneous Trades. The fishing trade is being badly hit by the coal stoppage. At Aberdeen upwards of 170 trawlers are lying idle, and at Grimsby the laying up of trawlers is also proceeding rapidly. Of 40 vessels landing catches at the latter port on one day, no less than 32 have been held up, bringing the total number of trawlers lying idle up to 400.Soap manufacturers in the Warrington and Widnes districts are working almost normal hours, and the copper trade also continues to employ all its workers.In the Metropolitan area there is some indication that if the coal stoppage continues, the amount of short-time working will he increased. In the building trade opportunities for placing building operatives other than bricklayers and plasterers have increased, owing to a demand, chiefly for carpenters and labourers, on work in connection with the national emergency.  There has also been more activity in the decorating trade.womens Employment.Local Reports. In the North-Western Division the towns chiefly affected by the improvement in the cotton trade are Accrington, Blackburn, Darwen, Earlstown, Heywood and Oldham. At Leigh, Bacup and Bury the cotton trade is easier, but the shortage of coal has necessitated the closing down of several mills. At Stalybridge short time is still being worked in the Egyptian cotton section. A few minor industries, for example, bag and sack making at Liverpool, and salt-packing at Runcorn, are re-absorbing discharged workers.The coal dispute is reported to have intensified the general depression in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. Textile workers have been affected at Armley, Attercliffe, Batley, Bradford, Hebden Bridge, Shipley and Sowerby Bridge, and unemployment is increasing among the lace workers at Basford, Beeston, Derby, Ilkeston and Long Eaton. The recent slight improvement in the hosiery industry of Nottingham and Derby has been entirely checked. Other industries adversely affected are pottery at Castleford, wire ropemaking at Retford, tailoring at Chesterfield, and carpet-weaving at Halifax. The only reports of increased activity come from the boot trade at Mansfield, and the flax industry at Goole and Selby.Northampton report activity in dressmaking and tailoring, though the clothing trade at Kettering, Oxford and Slough continues to be depressed. The satisfactory placing of women in agricultural work is reported from Wisbech.The industries employing women workers in the West Midlands Division continue to be very badly affected by the shortage of coal. At Burslem, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent and Worcester the pottery industry is at a standstill, anc[ many of the brickyards at Dudley, Stourbridge and Newcastle are closing down. Further unemployment is reported among metal machinists at Aston, Rugby and Sparkhill.In London the coal shortage does not yet appear to have been greatly felt. General depression continues to be experienced in all trades, but tailoring, needlework, tin box manufacture and jam-making are reported to be improving in certain isolated districts. Many theatrical workers have been added to the London live registers.In the South-Western Division, the industries specially affected by the coal shortage are cable-making at Southampton and Woolston and the pottery trade at Bristol. Seasonal activity in tailoring and dressmaking is reported from Devonport and Gosport, but efforts are still being made at Basingstoke to place unemployed tailoresses in other trades.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.The brickworks at Ruabon have been seriously affected by the coal stoppage. The effect of the coal dispute has been seriously felt by the ropery and twine workers at Hartle-pool, Wallsend, Willington Quay, and Sunderland. Though there is still considerable depression in the dressmaking and underclothing trade, it is noted that over 100 women have resumed work at the blouse factory at Kendal.In Scotland many factories have closed, and will not re-open until the coal dispute has been settled. Woollen textile workers, linen weavers, paper workers, thread workers, brick workers, pottery workers, rubber workers and calico printers are affected.local employment committees.Unemployment. The Bamstaple Employment Committee have arranged conferences, at which representatives of various Councils in North Devon were invited to attend, to discuss the alleviation of unemployment in the various localities. At these conferences the question of relief schemes has been very thoroughly explored, and each Council has submitted a scheme, to be included in an application to the Ministry of Transport for a grant.discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers,National Scheme.-!^ to and including the 18th April, 24,984 certificates have been issued to employers under the National Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 277,759 disabled ex-Service men.The Lord Chamberlain has circulated an appeal to firms holding the Royal Warrant whose names do not appear on the King&apos;s National Roll. Attention was drawn to the fact that, of 864 Royal Warrant holders who might reasonably be expected to be on the Roll, only 382 had been enrolled.The Minister of Health has issued an appeal to National Health Insurance Committees to assist the National Scheme by taking the necessary steps to secure enrolment. He points out that the example set by public bodies is of the utmost value in inducing private employers to accept the obligations of the National Scheme.juvenile branch.Centres for Unemployed Juveniles. The department have been informed by the Board of Education that approval has been given for the establishment of temporary unemploy-ment centres at Bristol, Manchester, Norwich and Salford. During the week ending the 13th April, five centres were open and the number of juveniles attending was 525.Juvenile Delinquents. A number of Juvenile Employment Committees have been successful in inducing local newspapers to keep the names of juvenile delinquents out of their police-court reports. The London Central Juvenile Advisory Committee have written on the subject to the Institute of Journalists, and have been informed that a resolution has been passed, urging all newspapers to withhold the names of juvenile offenders tried or convicted in children&apos;s courts, as well as those of children innocently involved in criminal cases. This resolution will be sent to associations of newspaper proprietors, and to all district committees and members of the Institute throughout the Empire.After-Care. The Carlisle Juvenile Advisory Committee are arranging close co-operation for purposes of after-care with the Juvenile Welfare Association. The advisory committee and the association will be kept informed of their respective activities by an exchange of minutes of meetings and reports.The first report of the Dundee After-Care Committee, who also work as a Juvenile Organisations Committee, has been received. The policy of the committee has been to institute or develop clubs and organisations for boys and girls wherever the need showed itself. For this purpose the city has been divided into nine wards, each with its separate sub-committee. In some of the wards very considerable progress has been made, but the want of suitable accommodation has proved a great difficulty.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 376, 377, 387 and 392.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT,APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 15th April, the department placed 337 candidates, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 53,553. Of these, 7,072 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 698 ex-Service men and 42 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 15th April was 11,100 ex-Service men and 1,244 civilians. At the same date 871 live vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 356 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 15th April, the department received 34 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,139, of which 1,434 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 700 cases. At the same date, 326 vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 30 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,170 cases, in 502 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 318 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 114 are still in training, and 24 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT,INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 19th April, 24,352 men were in training, as against 24,385 on the 12th April and 24,766 on the 22nd March. During the week, 373 men were placed in training. There were 16,847 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 12th April and thie 22nd March being 16,867 and 16,482. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 30,114, the totals for the 12th April and the 22nd March being 29,708 and 28,458.Trade depression and industrial troubles are reflected in the present position of training work generally. With many discharges, and much short time, trade representa-tives can hardly be expected to be enthusiastic about the admission of new recruits to their craft, while the same causes tend to keep up the numbers on the waiting lists and to impair the immediate prospects of men who have been trained. The curve of progress, which showed a steady and very marked rise until last autumn, was then checked, and, after a few months during which no appreciable advance was made, has, since the beginning of the year, followed a downward course.New Openings. The suggestion comes from one or two quarters that a further investigation into the possibilities of the distributive trades as sources of training openings might lead to good results. In Middlesex a number of men have been selected for training as salesmen at the depots of Mr. J. Sainsbury.Extensions of Training-The monthly returns of extensions of training for March have been collated, and it is estimated that, at the end of the month, approximately 1,700 men were being retained in training centres as being unable to obtain improvership vacancies.Elementary School Teachers.-It has at last been found possible to open the Training College at Springfield, Birmingham. Accommodation is provided for 150 men, and, as over 140 have started work, the college, for all practical purposes, is already full.The Treasury have now withdrawn the condition that was attached to their sanction of the Loughborough and Westminster Training College schemes, and it is hoped that 60 men will start work at Loughborough on the 1st May, and a group of 20 on the following
Appointments and Training--continued.day at Westminster, with a further group of 20 to follow at a later date. The Loughborough Centre is a large and well-equipped technical school, and the Westminster institution is a training college which has been recognised and at work for many years.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 20th April agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,155 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,060 apprentices, employed by 17,519 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agreement between the parties is now 23,112.Unemployment. Local headquarters for the North-Western area report that the general outlook in industry was brighter up to Easter, but that this has been quite eclipsed by the present industrial crisis. In many firms it has been necessary to suspend apprentices under the scheme, which has added to the difficulty in placing other apprentices.Institutional Training. The principal of the Paisley Technical College has been interviewed with respect to the progress and attendance of apprentices at the second whole-time class. The report was not altogether satisfactory, and it is thought that the reason may lie in the fact that, in the first whole-time class, apprentices enrolled of their own free will with a desire to improve their knowledge, voluntarily sacrificing the higher wage obtained in the workshop, while the second class is composed of apprentices avIio are more or less forced, either through actual suspension or through suspension owing to slackness of trade, to take up theoretical studies.Applications for institutional training continue to he received by local headquarters for the North-Western area. At present there are approximately 70 apprentices in the area undergoing technical training.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. The work of setting up an apprenticeship committee for Great Grimsby is proceeding. At a recent meeting, representative of the industry, various points in connection with the national scheme were discussed, and apparently the difficulty in regard to the Grimsby and Cleethorpes education authorities working in conjunction with each other has been overcome. The North Shields, Tynemouth and Whitley Bay Apprenticeship Committee are to hold a mass meeting on the 22nd April to explain the scheme to the rank and file.Joint conferences of employers and operatives have been held at Leamington and Rugby. At Folkestone a meeting of the master builders is to be held, and the education authorities, who originally took very little interest in the scheme, have apparently decided to render every assistance in their power.The secretary of the Sussex Master Builders&apos; Association states that Brighton employers have appointed representatives for a committee. They are now awaiting similar action on the part of the operatives. It is hoped that employers at Lincoln, with the exception of the master painters, will be willing to give the scheme their consideration. The master painters have a scheme of their own and do not feel justified in abandoning it.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on page 387.]
