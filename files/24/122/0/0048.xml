PART II.GENERAL INT^LLIQPNOS.INBIA.laziri^tan     Enemy activity is increasing.    Organised attacks nave been made on protective troops and convoys, during which hand-to-hand fight jug has taken plaoe.   All attacks haW been repulsed with loss to enemy. &quot;The Persian Minister in Madrid is proceeding to Sweden to engage some 24 officers on the active list for service in the Persian gendarmerie.     The Prime Minister, though he would prefer to engage British officers, thinks it essential that this force should he under neutral officers in the northern provinces, as he considers that the Russians would never acquiesce for long in the presence of Persian troops on their frontier under British officers.Persian forces under British officers will occupy portions of the front against the Bolsheviks after the withdrawal of the British force in North Persia.   In view, however, of the recent change in the situation, the probability of the Bolsheviks attaching has been greatly diminished.The Persian Cossacks have taken over our forward positions in the Menjil area and our troops are now two marches south of Menjil.   G.O.O. North Persian Force expects that our traops w,ill be clear of Ramadan by 1st !,ray arc! that all troops will be at Q,uaraitu, the railhead of the Cluaraitu-3aghdad railway by 14th May.It is now reported that the Bolsheviks have been firing at the Persian positions.The Finnish Government has commenced the construction of a raitvvay in the Kivamoni - Petohcnga district and the improvement of the harbour at the mouth of the river *   There appears to be a certain amount of friction on the Norwegian frontier.ESTONIA.The economic situation remains critical.   The Soviet Government has recently assumed a more threatening attitude towards Estonia.RUSSIA.Siberia.It is reported that the Siberian Railway functions to the Eastward only as far as El:aterinburg.   The Far-IUastem communication is interrupted by Cossack&apos;and armed peasant raiddis . The anti-Bolshovik peasant movement is stated to be pvvwinv * in the Vladivostok   area, &apos;
NORWAY.Unrest is reported in the neighbourhood of Vardo attributed to Bolshevik propaganda.ITALY,The Royal Decree dissolving the present Parliament, and providing for a general eleotisn m 15th May, and tho re-assembling of tho now Parliament on 11th June, has been signed.GREECE.A new Ministry has been formed under Hi Gounaris as President.    M. Kalogoropoulos is not included.It is reported that the Greek Government have definite information of persooution of Greeks by tho Albanians.   The Albanian authorities have been informed that Greece will take active stops to protect these people if this persecution continues.    It is oortain that Albanian and Bulgarian oomitadjis are in communication, and a concentration of Albanian troops near the frontier is rumoured;   but there are between 6,000 and 7,000 Greek troops in Spirus, to deal with any danger which may ariso.ARABIA.Ibin Saud is within thirty r,i les of Hail, and fighting is believed to be imminent.JTJGO island.VIA.It is reported that there is a good prospect of the Serbian Government taking 20,000 men of tfrangel!s refugees in the near future.   It is thought that the majority of men selected, will he Oossaoks, some of which will he used as guards on tho Albanian frontier.   Workmen, especially engineers,&quot;are also needed.TURKEY.The Nationalist delegation to the recent London Conference arrived in Constantinople (where they stayed with the Italian High Commissioner as the guests of the Italian Government) on the loth April, and left lor Angora, via Ineboli, on the 14th.     The leader, Bokir Sami, hold no&apos;communication with the British High Commissioner, and die. not see the Sultan, hut conferred with various members of the Central Government. There is not, however, any prospect of the two rival governments ceasing to exist.   The political situ/vli on at Constantinople is difficult to assess, hut Towfik Pasha        very likely remain in power for the present with a re-constituted Government.The attitude of the Nationalists towards the Sultan is respoctful, but should he summon Dam&amp;i Ferid to form a government, they would dethrone him, and appoint a successor.
They seem prepared to accept the decisions of the London Conference except as regards Smyrna, but would accept a mixed allied administration for Smyrna. In Thrace, they would be content with the Enos-Midia line. Generally, they seem anxious for a settlement, and show symptoms of moderation.

Greek operations.

In the northern sector the Greeks have retired to their original line east of Brusa.

In the south, they are withdrawing from Afium Karahissar, and intend to take up the line Akar Dagh - Tonlu Punar - Murad Dagh - Gedis Chai. In this sector, the Turks made an attack north of Toulu Punar; but were driven back to Yalia Chalkemi and Ulujak.

The last Greek Division are taking up a position of the line Chivril - Karatash - Nazili.

It is reported that the failure of the Greek offensive was due to incompetency in the higher commands, and bad staff work, which was responsible for the breaking down of the transport arrangements.

This is largely attributable to the fact that the Venizelist officers were relieved by Constantinists just before the offensive was started. The latter have had little experience of active service since the last Balkan War.

It is now reported that a reconciliation has taken place, between the Constantine and Venezelist officers, the latter having offered their services to the Greek Government.
