MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON&apos;WHOLESALE FOOD MARKETS.FOURTH   REPORT.LONDON WHOLESALE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE MARKETS.To the FOOD CONTROLLER.We have the honour to submit our Fourth Report dealing with the London Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Markets.I. A list of the markets concerned and a statement of the Authorities under which they are operated was published as an appendix to our First Report. In relation to that list we have now to point out that the purchase of Spitalfields Market has been completed and this market is at present fully owned and administered by the Corporation of the City of London. We also understand that the owners of the property and market rights of Convent Garden Market have recently made attempts to sell the property.II. Before dealing with the condition and requirements of individual markets, the following considerations are of general application.A. RAILWAY TRANSPORT.Statements by Representatives of the Industry.1. Nearly all the witnesses representing the industry expressed dissatisfaction with the existing railway transport arrangements both from producing areas to the London termini and from the termini to the markets. Even before the War the facilities provided both as regards railway service and delivery were the subject of serious criticism; and it is represented to us that the 1914 standard in this respect has been by no means yet regained.It was stated by representatives of the growers and merchants that before the War special fast goods services were run by the Railway Companies for the conveyance of perishable fruit and vegetables and we are informed that the bulk of the produce was then conveyed by goods train. Many of these services were withdrawn during the War and all have not yet been reinstated. The result is said to be twofold :-(a) In the case of the cheaper vegetables which will not stand a passenger rate, transport is made by ordinary goods train and we are informed that delays are frequent. Tn many cases through these delays green vegetables arrive in London in very poor condition. A proportion is destroyed and the remainder has to be sold at a low price, sometimes less than the charge made by the Railway Company for transport. It was stated that this is having the effect of discouraging production and is bound to react unfavourably in the long run on prices.(b) In the case of certain fruits and vegetables the traders have had to resort to the passenger services, and it was given in evidence that of the fruit which is conveyed from London to the North of England over 80 per cent, is sent by passenger train at a greatly enhanced cost, averaging about five times the pre-war goods rate. This additional cost falls on the consumer.It is further stated that there are considerable delays on&apos; the part of, the Railway Companies in delivering produce from the railway termini to the markets. This delay frequently results in produce arriving on the market after sales are over for the day and deterioration is thereby caused. We are informed that owing to the occurrence of these delays growers in the producing areas within a restricted radius of London are utilising motor-transport to an increasing extent, but this means of overcoming the difficulty does not help the more remote districts.A complaint is also made by the Trade to the effect that there is a tendency to run goods received by any given Railway Company as far as possible on that Company&apos;s line, although an alternative route involving transit partly over another line would give a. more expeditious service and would involve less cartage in London.(32498) Wt. 37477-3713 10,80 4/21 h. St, q.36 a 2
Statements by Representatives of the Railway Companies.2. iii reply to these criticisms the railway representative stated that the various Railway Companies, recognising the perishability oi the fruit and vegetable traffic, make special arrange-ments to ensure early deliveries, in the case of fruit grown in Kent, for instance, where the quantity despatched may vary from 50 to 1.U00 tuns a day, special fruit trains are always available to run the maximum quantity.The suggestion that produce from all parts of the country should be consigned to the railway station nearest to the market was said to be impracticable.In many cases this would involve transference of the goods at various junctions; the advantages of a through service to the London terminus would be lost, delay would result and additional cost would be incurred.The railway representative added that sufficient cartage strength is available at the railway depots to guard against delays in delivering the goods to the markets. He laid special stress on the lack of facilities for receiving and unloading vans at the markets, and explained that any delay which might occur in delivering goods was due to this cause. In this connection he stated that a free period of two hours is generally allowed by the Railway Companies for unloading, but the South Eastern and Chatham Company do not make a charge for delays in excess of this period as they do not accept the principle that their vans can be allowed to be detained for as much as two hours. The average detention of vehicles belonging to this Railway Company at Covent Garden between 1st July, 1920, and 31st October, 1920, was J hour 47 minutes on a total number of 11,461 van loads. It was stated that in no provincial market of importance is there any unreasonable detention of vans; this practice is peculiar to -London and is caused by the bad planning and inadequate accommodation and approaches of London markets.The representative of the South Eastern and Chatham Hallway Company informed us that the train services now provided in effect bring produce to London in good time for the opening of the markets. This Company has, in our opinion, provided adequate railway sendees for the district covered by its operations.The latter witness also stated that if adequate facilities were provided for taking prompt delivery of produce at all markets, so that night trains could be cleared on arrival, his Company would be able to deliver the whole of their consignments before the market opened. The Superintendent of Spitalfields Market, who had taken up the appointment on the completion of the purchase by the Corporation of the City of London, informed the Committee that since June last he has already effected a substantial improvement in that respect by the appointment of Traffic Controllers with instructions to insist on the off-loading of vehicles immediately on arrival. He states that the practice of delaying vehicles pending the sale of their contents has by this means been minimised, and that goods now are required to be cleared from the vans and brought into the market building for sale, except in eases of growers&apos; vans occupying the special stands rented by them for the purpose. We desire to draw attention to the success which has attended the adoption in this case of the principle recommended in the majority report dealing with the conditions which are desirable for the wholesale fish market for London.Representatives of the traders agreed with the view of the Railway Companies that there is much room for improvement in respect of planning accommodation and approaches of the markets, and that delays do occur as the result of these defects.In reply to the statement made in para. 1 (b), the representative of the Railway Companies informs us that before the War certain fast day goods services to the north were run, practically on the lines of passenger services but at goods train rates. The supply of goods for the trains was then variable, and at the acute period of the War these services could no longer be justified and were abandoned. There has since been no guarantee of a sufficient and regular quantity of goods to justify the re-instatement of these special services. The Companies are quite prepared to reconsider the position when it can be shown to be remunerative. Meantime, every possible effort is being made in all directions to accelerate the ordinary goods services which are stated now to approximate to pre-war conditions.3. We are strongly of opinion that where possible special provision should be made for fast goods services from the principal fruit and vegetable growing districts to London, to be organised and run to advertised scheduled times as is already done by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company. In working out such services it is essential that they should be so arranged as to secure delivery at the markets in time for the early morning trade.4. The railway representatives emphasised the fact that many of the difficulties which the Railway Companies have to face are caused by the practice of growers loading small coHsign-ments instead of combining to forward full truck-loads.We share the view of the Railway Companies in this matter and are strongly of opinion that both the markets and the Railway Company would be benefited to the ultimate advantage of the consumer if there was more co-operation between growers in the direction of combination for the purpose of forwarding consignments in two to three-ton loads instead of in separate small parcels.   In this way a lower rate would be secured and labour generally considerably reduced.We are of opinion that if the growers can be induced to combine in this manner, many of the current difficulties of railway transport will disappear. This view was put forward by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company to the Board of Agriculture in July, 1916, and had the effect of enabling fruit and vegetables from the Kent districts to be forwarded at the lowest possible railway rate, and also by special goods service. Representatives of the Agricultural Organisation Society stated tha.t the Society was strongly in favour of this policy, but they were unable to point to any case in which they had secured its adoption among their members. There appears to be no reason why the advantages secured in Denmark by co-operation in the handling of agricultural produce should mot also be realised by the British grower.
We are of opinion that the difficulties indicated by this evidence afford a further reason for a Central Market Authority which, with the assistance of the Market Advisory Committees, would be in a position to co-ordinate the interests of the traders and the Railway Companies. We have an open mind as to the composition of such Authority, as suggested in our First Report.5. Increased substitution of motor for horse-drawn traffic is a marked feature of present conditions, and this factor will emphasise the need for general improvement in the approaches 10 markets, and the necessity for providing the market buildings with suitable facilities for off-loading as well as additional exterior space within which the large lorries generally used can be efficiently handled. With regard to the use of tractors and trailers for market deliveries, it is pointed out by a representative of the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis that a tractor with two trailers comes within the category of a locomotive, and its speed, is restricted by existing regulations to a maximum of four miles per hour. This witness was of the opinion that the motor-lorry of the prevailing type was a suitable vehicle for this purpose, and that while some obstruction would undoubtedly he caused by the use of single trailers, there was no substantial objection to the employment of this type of vehicle provided that sufficient space in the neighbour-hood of the markets could be provided.B. IMPORTED FRUIT.1. Fruit from Spain. Portugal, and Italy, and the Mediterranean, as well as a considerable quantity of imported vegetables, particularly tomatoes and onions, are shipped direct to the Port of London, the smaller vessels unloading at the wharves in the neighbourhood of London Bridge, while larger boats are unloaded in the docks lower down the river, sales taking place in the London Markets, the principal centres being the sale room at Pudding Lane, operated by the City Fruit Brokers&apos; Association, and the Floral Hall at Covent Garden.Australian fruit, &amp;c, is chiefly unloaded at the docks, the Floral Hall being the principal saleroom dealing in this class of goods. A considerable quantity of American and Canadian fruit is shipped direct to London and unloaded, as a rule, at the docks.The sales of apples by auction at Spitalfields have recently been resumed.A proportion of this fruit is also landed at Southampton and forwarded to the Floral Hall for sale via Nine Elms Goods Station. Quite recently arrangements have been made, so far with success, for periodical sales of fruit in the Docks at Southampton1, from which point con-signments for the provinces are forwarded direct, and the cost of the unnecessary transit to London and additional handling entailed in respect of provincial sales is thereby saved. South African fruit is chiefly landed at Southampton and forwarded to London by rail. This, as a rule, is not sold by auction at the Floral Hall but goes into the London Markets to consignees for sale on commission.2. As stated above, the Pudding Lane salerooms are the property of the City Fruit Brokers&apos; Association, which consists of four firms only. It was established about 100 years ago, and we are informed that no claim has ever been&apos; made on this saleroom in respect of market! rights and tolls under any of the existing market authorities. The fruit is graded and sales take place by auction from samples in the salerooms, purchasers having had an opportunity to examine the fruit and bulk in the warehouses if they so dpsire. Tt was stated in evidence that these ware-houses do not provide proper facilities for this examination, and that the lack of light and space at the wharves makes grading unsatisfactory. The salesmen in the Pudding Lane saleroom safeguard themselves by a clause stating that &quot; anv packages on show before the time of sale are not shown as or meant to be representative of the bulk.&quot; A representative of this Associn-tion informs us that these sales are open&apos; to all, and that only on one occasion has a man been refused admission, the refusal in this case being brought about bv his failure to pay for previous purchases. It was stated that most of tbp frn.it sold at Pudding Lane goes to the wholesale fruit and vegetable markets in London for re-sale. The Commission charged at Pudding Lane is stated to be 2 per cent.3. The sales at Floral Hall are conducted by brokers, who are tenants uhlder the owners of the market. The goods handled by them are sold By auction from catalogues, samples being displayed.   The goods to which these samples relate are brought up from the place of landingto the precincts of the market and are there graded for sale; the buyers at Pudding Lane and Floral Hall may be wholesale merchants, retailers, or even eostermongers.4. At Spitalfields it was found to be unsatisfactory to sell by sample with delivery of bulk from the London Docks. One merchant who has re-commenced sales by auction brings the whole of his goods to his warehouse in the Old Columbia Market, where sorting is carried out before the sale, and from which delivery is taken.5. On the evidence given we have no reason to supjx)se that the sales at Pudding Lane and Floral Hall are conducted in other than a perfectly open and straightforward manner, and in this respect these salerooms appear to be free from the suspicions that might exist in the case of closed salerooms, where bids are only accepted from, a restricted number of members. We consider, however, that the system is open to serious criticism in other respects, and particularly in regard to the lack of facilities offered for inspection of the bulk of the goods: sold at Pudding Lane; the addition of market charges made on goods coming&quot; through the London Markets nrior to dispatch to the provinces; and the additional cartage and handling involved, particularly in the case of goods brought to Covent Garden for sale and ultimate dispatch to the provinces. The railway representatives stated in this connection that the amount of imported fruit consigned annually by rail to the provinces from Covent Garden alone was approximately 64,600 tons.
6. Evidence has been given before the Committee in support of a proposal that sales by auction of imported fruit should be permitted at the docks where such fruit is laoided. The representative of the Port of London Authority stated that his Authority was prepared to offer facilities of this kind to any trade or section of a trade without granting a monopoly, provided that satisfactory guarantees could be furnished. He also emphasised the point that the Port of London Authority are not a trading body and have no desire and no power to open a market, but as a public body they are prepared to consider any scheme which may be brought forward by the trade and, if possible, offer facilities for its development.It was stated in evidence that one such definite application had been made and permission to hold the sales in question had been refused by the late lessee of Spitalfields Market by authority claimed under the terms of his Charter.It was stated by witnesses in support of the proposal that the denial of this privilege compels a considerable quantity of fruit to be brought up to London and passed through the London salerooms, or markets which might otherwise be forwarded direct to provincial buyers, and that, so far as concerns this proportion of the goods, road traffic and handling would be minimised, market charges and cost of labour saved, and more expeditious delivery obtained, if sales were effected at the docks.7. The suggestion was opposed by the representative of the London Fruit, Flower and Vegetable Markets Association and the City Fruit Brokers&apos; Association for the following reasons :  (a) Buyers, as a whole, are satisfied with the present method of distribution.(b) There will be no saving of transport; contractors&apos; vans at the docks would be replaced by even a greater number of retailers&apos; vans, (a) There as no dock which has easy access to buyers who can at present purchase all home-grown and imported fruits from Covent Garden.With regard to these objections we would point out that there is no desire to enforce sales at the docks, that the purchasers in all probability would be wholesale dealers or their agents, and that if the importers or consignees desire an opportunity of conducting such sales, it should be accorded to them inasmuch as the risk is theirs and the success of the undertaking can only be determined by experiment. In this connection we would again refer to the enterprise lately inaugurated at Southampton which appears to have all1 the elements of success, and also to the example furnished by the sales of imported fruit and vegetables on the Riverside Quay at Hull where cargoes are habitually sampled, sold, and loaded on rail for despatch within the limits of a single working day with a minimum of handling, and, so far as concerns despatch to places outside Hull, without any road transport being required.8. After taking into full consideration the whole of the case submitted to us, we are definitely of opinion that facilities on reasonable terms should be afforded by the Market Authority in agreement with the Port of London Authority, for the sale by auction of imported fruit and vegetables at any of the docks.in the Port of London where a demand for this method of disposal can be shown to exist.C. PORTERAGE.1. The general system of charging porterage in the London fruit and vegetable markets differs from that in force at most of the large provincial markets of the same kind, where the&apos; terms of sale are on the basis of delivery to the buyers&apos; van if in the precincts of the market. In the London markets the cost of porterage is borne directly by the buyer, being usually collected as a separate item on his account, while the porters themselves are in these cases paid by the sellers. In some instances the buyer pays the porters in cash. It is represented that this system is unsatisfactory, because it takes the responsibility from the salesmen of making a proper delivery to the buyer who has not himself engaged the porter or had any opportunity of supervising the latter&apos;s operations.On this point we are of opinion that the salesman should accept full responsibility for the work of the porter employed by him.A further complaint is made that charges are levied by sellers for porterage which do not exactly correspond with the amounts actually paid to the porters themselves, and that further charges are, in certain cases, made on goods which have not in fact been handled by porters in she market. If the existing practice of paying a rate per package is maintained, we are of opinion that lists of authorised charges should be prominently displayed by all salesmen, and that the system at present working successfully in the Floral Hall, which enables the porter to check the amount due to him, should be generally adopted.2. It is represented, moreover, that the system prevailing in some of the markets of paying the porters for their work at a rate per package is thoroughly unsatisfacotry. The men them-selves are very unequally paid and the tasks are of so variable a nature as to afford room for considerable abuses and favouritism.On this point we are of opinion that all porters should be licenced by the Market Authority and paid at standard rates, the terms of which should be settled by the organisations representing the salesmen, buyers, and porters.D. CONDITIONS OF SALE.1. The evidence on the subject of the sale of fruit and vegetables is confined chiefly to sales on commission.The representative of the Evesham and District Market Gardeners&apos; Association stated that the prices charged to consumers are out of all proportion to the returns to the producers, and
that under the present system the interests of the growers are not safeguarded. He stated that the accounts rendered by salesmen often did not supply an accurate record of the transaction. It appears to be the practice in many cases for the salesmen to return an average price for produce consigned to them. The evidence shows a difference of opinion on this subject. On one side it was claimed that the actual prices realised should be returned to particular growers, but on the other hand it was pointed out that consignments of produce from the same district of similar quality and similarly packed often bring different prices on the market according to the time of sale, and that in such cases the return of actual prices would cause dissatisfaction among the growers, to whom it would often be difficult to account for the variation.On the question of sales on commission, we recommend that the Market Authority should be empowered to make the following regulations :-(a) That salesmen should only be allowed to operate in the market under licence fromthe Market Authority, licences heing issued on production of satisfactory evidence as to business integrity and financial stability.(b) That an authorised table of rates of commission and other charges should be prepared and published with the sanction of the Market Authority on the advice of the Market Advisory Committees.(c) That a standard form of account only should be used for sales on commission andthat the details of charges&apos; other than commission should be separately stated thereon.(d) That invoices to buyers should be similarly standardised and subject to the sameprovision as to statement in detail of all charges.E. BENTS AND TOLL8.1. As will be seen from our reports on the individual markets below, the practice with regard to charging rents and tolls varies considerably. We consider that the present systems in force of charging rents and tolls, should be standardised for all the London Markets, and also that adequate space should be provided for producers selling their own goods.2. Tenancies are at present nominally subject, as a general rule, to a week&apos;s notice. No goodwill appears to be recognised by the Market Authorities, but, as a matter of fact, continuity of tenure is secured by the practice of taking in partners. It appears to us that, in Tact, goodwill is created, and we are bound to recognise the necessity for fixity of tenure within reasonable limits, which should be the subject of review from the point of view of public interest. With the provision of adequate accommodation in the markets, any artificial value that may attach to a stand under existing conditions would disappear.III. With regard to the particular markets covered by our terms of reference, we desire to offer the following observations and recommendations : COVENT GARDEN MARKET.1. The owners of the property are the Covent Garden Estate Company Limited, a Com-pany formed under the direction of the Chancery Court, for the purpose of carrying through the contract made by the late Sir Joseph Beecham with the Duke of Bedford, for the purchase of the Covent Garden Markets and the surrounding property. The whole of the shares are held for and on behalf of the estate of the late Sir Joseph Beecham or those interested in the same. There are no outside shareholders. In addition to the markets, the Company owns a large quantity of the adjoining property, which when let for market business is subject to agreement that the tenants thereof will pay the same tolls upon articles dealt in by them as would Have been leviable if they had been sold in the market.The Company has statutory power to let shops and buildings to tenants by the year, or for any shorter period at fixed rates. It also has power to provide and let stands on similar terms. It is worth while to point out in this connection that the Act (Act 9, George IV, Chap, cxiii) recognises that growers are to have a preferable right to bring their produce to these stands and sell it themselves2. The market covered by the precise provisions of the Charter has an area of about 130,000 square feet. Within the last 50 years the following subsidiary market buildings have been erected : The Floral Hall (Foreign Fruit Market),Russell Street Market,The Flower Market,The Foreign Flower Market andThe Tavistock Street Area.The total area is about 250,000 square feet or 5f acres.3. On the evidence given we have no doubt that the market in its present condition is altogether inadequate to the necessities of the trade. The buildings are obsolete, inconvenient and badly lighted, although we note that an improvement in the latter respect is now being carried out. The internal conditions in our opinion are such as greatly add to the cost of handling produce, and are responsible for much of the delay that is stated to occur in the delivery of goods both to and from the market. One of the most conspicuous results of this inadequacy is the development of outside business. Merchants who in a number of cases are tenants of one of the small and inconvenient stands in the market, have found it necessary io32498
provide themselves with other accommodation in the immediate neighbourhood, and this growth has now extended as far North as Long Acre and is continuing. In fact, it was stated that half of the total business of the market is at present transacted outside its area. The considerable proportion of this business, which is done on property belonging to the Covent Garden Estate Company Limited, is&apos;charged with market tolls. In the case of merchants whose premises are not the property of the Covent Garden Company but who occupy stands in the market, market tolls are also levied on the whole of the produce sold, whether on the stand or in the outside premises. A third class of merchants, who are not tenants of the market and occupy premises in its immediate neighbourhood which do not belong to the Covent Garden Company, have a favourable handicap inasmuch as they are able to transact their business without any of the market charges levied on their neighbours and competitors. A representative of the Market Gardeners&apos; Association complained that growers whom as indicated above, are entitled to pre-ference in the use of the outside stands, are being gradually pushed out of the market.4. Traffic Congestion. For very many years there has been no improvement in the approach to the market, although the business done in the larger area has increased considerably and is still increasing. The regulation of this traffic is the outcome of a recommendation contained in a Keport made by Mr. Justice Lawrence&apos;s Committee, and dated 28th June, 1918. The evidence of the police is to the effect that substantial improvement has been obtained since the regulations were put into force. At the same time the Police Authorities pointed out that the development of the external trade in the area, between the market itself and Long Acre had introduced a new element of difficulty into this work, and that no permanently effective improve-ment could be hoped for so long as the present conditions were allowed to exist. The various classes of buyers and sellers using the market are practically unanimous in their view that the difficulties of the present building and its surroundings seriously hamper their trade. The railway authorities have also represented in strong terms the loss that they incur by reason of the difficulties of obtaining an expeditious delivery of rail borne produce into the market area. The railway representative gave the total annual supplies brought by railway to the market as approximately 153,000 tons.The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company, which is stated to deliver more than 50 per cent, of the fruit and vegetables coming into this market, have represented that delay id delivering goods is caused not only by the defective plan and approaches to the market, but by the fact that no provision is made by the majority of the merchants for accepting delivery during the night, as is the case with certain other markets. In consequence, this company is unable to clear its trains on arrival or to employ its road transport expeditiously or economically. It frequently happens, moreover, that produce which, so far as the railway company is con-corned, could have been made available for the early morning trade, is not delivered until the market has been closed, a practice in the case of perishable fruit and vegetables which means ultimate loss both to the producer and to the consumer.In this connection we would again refer to the system under which imported fruit is at present dealt with. It appears to us that to some, although not to a sufficient extent, the con-gestion at Covent Garden might be relieved by the direct dispatch of supplies to provincial markets, and buyers from the points of landing. It is obviously uneconomical that such supplies should be brought into Covent Garden at a heavy expense for cartage, unloaded there, subjected to market tolls, porterage charges, &amp;c, and again re-loaded and carted to the railway termini for despatch, when one operation might well cover the whole transaction.5. Site. The situation of the market is central, and although an alternative was suggested by one witness we are of opinion that there are not sufficient grounds lor suggesting a removal of the market. The accommodation generally, however, is altogether inadequate even to the amount of trade which is at present done in the market, without taking into account the undoubted growth which is to be expected. The obvious direction in which the market area should be extended was indicated by several witnesses who pointed out the advantages of securing for this purpose the block of buildings to the South-West including St. Paul&apos;s Church, and extending the market over an area as far as Bedford Street in that direction and bounded by King Street on the North and Henrietta Street on the South. If this site could be secured it would provide means for an adequate market building fitted with proper accommodation both for salesmen&apos;s stands as well as for those producers who bring their goods by road and need stands outside for the sale of their produce. Suitable office and other accommodation could also be provided, and a considerable relief afforded to the congestion of the market by the construction of alleyways, permitting a substantial number of delivery vehicles to unload direct on the stands. This would give opportunities for the inevitable development of motor traffic which is now taking place. We are of opinion that if this additional accommodation could be provided, the majority of the merchants at present conducting their business in the neighbourhood of the market would be glad to acquire stands, to the great advantage both of the traffic and of the trade. In any case, the existing building should be reconstructed, and in the new buildings consideration might be given to the provision of accommodation at a higher level than the ground floor The area surrounding the market, including the proposed additional site, should also be substantially widened in order to accommodate as much traffic as possible in the immediate vicinity of the building. With the exception of the Church, we understand that practically the whole of the property concerned in this proposal belongs to the Covent Garden Estate Company Limited.6. We desire especially to draw attention to the fact already mentioned, that the owners of this market are at present making active efforts to dispose of it. We wish to record our opinion, in the strongest possible terms, that this market, the largest of its kind in the Kingdom
should be placed under a public authority with a view to its development in the interests of the trade and the consumer.7. Porterage.-The general observations put forward by us in Section II, C, apply par-ticularly to Covent Garden. Under the byelaws, made on the authority of the Act of George IV. (cap. cxin.), 1828, it is provided that every person intending to apply for hire or to work in the said market as a basket woman or carrier shall be provided by the superintendent of the market with a ticket, and shall not work unless so provided. This has the effect of requiring all porters to be licensed, but we are informed that a considerable number of the porters are in favour of a licensing scheme, and that negotiations are at present pending with a view to the enforcement of the byelaw. We are of opinion, on this point, that all porters should be licensed by the Market Authority.We find that the terms under which porterage is paid vary considerably. In some cases the porter is employed by a. salesman, who pays him a retaining fee, and, in addition, he may receive either from the salesman or the buyer payment on the basis of a rate per package for the goods handled by him. It is alleged by representatives of the men that the porters do not receive the whole of the money collected by the salesmen in.respect of the goods they carry. At the same time, we are informed that, in respect of the retaining fee, the porter performs other services than those of porterage. In another class of cases porters attach themselves by custom to particular growers, who sell their own produce from wagons and stands. These men do not, as a rule, receive a. retaining fee, but are paid entirely at rates per package by the grower or by the purchaser. A third class consists of casual porters plying for hire, who are also paid at rates per package. The rates charged are at present the subject of considerable discussion between those concerned, and the incidence of the porterage as between buyer and seller is also the subject of complaint. We are of opinion that the whole subject is one which can only be settled by a properly constituted public authority, having power to enforce its bye-laws and in agreement with the various parties concerned.B. BOROUGH MARKET.1. The Market Rights of the Borough Market are vested in the Churchwarden, Overseers, and inhabitants of the Borough of Southwark, and for a considerable time the market has been a source of revenue, applied to the relief of the rates of that parish. In the event of a deficit, the parish may be charged with a rate not exceeding 6rf. in the  .The market is administered by 21 trustees, who are appointed by the local authority concerned.2. The area of the actual market is about three acres, but, as in the case of Covent Garden, a considerable amount of the trade is carried on in shops and warehouses outside the market itself, but in its neighbourhood. In the case of the Borough, however, the business done in these premises is not subject to tolls. The market building itself is extremely dark and inconvenient, and is crossed by two branches of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway  carried on brick arches. The approaches are very narrow and congested, the traffic going to and from the Hibernia Wharf, which is between the market building and the river, adding to the difficulties. It is somewhat unfortunate that this wharf, for all practical purposes, cuts off tho market from the river front, which would be its natural direction for development. If this difficulty could be overcome, there appears to be no reason why a considerable quantity of imported produce should not be brought to the Borough by means of lighters. As a matter of fact, there is a small dock (St. Saviour&apos;s Dock) which at present could accommodate one or two lighters for this purpose, but it has no space for dealing with the goods when landed, and we are informed that, in fact, no use is at present made of it for market purposes. A considerable quantity of the produce brought to the Borough Market is carried by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company, and this produce is, for the most part, unloaded by the Railway Company at Bricklayers&apos; Arms and, to some extent, at Blackfriars Bridge. From these points delivery takes place by van. The suggestion has been made that the portion of the railway crossing the market should be widened to allow of the construction of sidings and lifts, by which the rail-borne produce could be actually brought into the market itself, with a minimum of handling and cartage thus entirely avoided. The South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company have considered this proposal, but have decided that it was impracticable.We are of opinion that both the site and the buildings of the Borough Market are thoroughly unsuitable, and that no considerable expenditure on improvement is justifiable in this case. A very large trade is, however, carried on at this centre, particularly in potatoes and such fruit and vegetables as are in popular demand. A market on the south side of the river affords a very useful centre for the distribution of the produce of the south-eastern counties, par-ticularly in view of the present development of motor transport; and when circumstances are more favourable we are of opinion that a. modern market should be erected on some convenient site not too far removed from that of the present market, and so placed as to be in touch with Che southern railway system.The Market Superintendent stated that the Trustees have acquired property in Three ^jwvns Square and propose making another entrance to the market from the Borough High /treet.3. Twenty porters are engaged by the Trustees and are paid weekly wages, with uniform, noots. sick pay, and free medical treatment. These porters handle all produce in the market, and their services are charged to the tenants. A. complaint was made that unnecessary delays iKjeur in unloading owing to the number of porters supplied by the Trustees being inadequate. :38498 A 5
4. The railway representative gave the total annual supplies brought by railway to the market as approximately 124,000 tons. The chief deliveries of this produce are made by the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company, and the detention of the railway teams during the busy season is stated to be serious, amounting at times to as much as from 3 to 4 hours.One of the difficulties of the present situation of the market is the inadequate space for the accommodation of vans in the immediate neighbourhood of the market building. The buyers&apos; vans, to a considerable extent, have to stand at some distance from the market, and goods have to be conveyed to them across a busy thoroughfare, which is fully occupied with its own traffic. The representative of the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis was of opinion that the present police arrangements were meeting this difficulty, but this view is not supported by other evidence receivedC. SP1TALFIELDS MARKET.1. Market Rights. As already stated above (para 1), the Corporation of the City of London are now the owners of the freehold and Market Rights of this market. The market itself is said to extend for half the width of the streets surrounding the buildings, while monopoly rights conferred by the Charter are claimed to be valid within a radius of 7 miles. Under these rights the Great Eastern Railway Company pay commuted tolls to the extent of about  2,000 per annum in respect of the produce sold at their market at Stratford.2. The area of the market is a little over two acres and during the last lessee&apos;s tenancy the actual space available lor market purposes was increased by the removal of houses formerly on the market property. The internal arrangements are good and intersecting roadways enable traffic to be handled easily inside the market, the produce to a considerable extent being unloaded directly on to the stands.The approaches to the market are not satisfactory and are liable to become very congested. The front of the market abutting on Commercial Street is occupied by warehouses which deal largely in potatoes and vegetables. The representative of the Metropolitan Police stated that the great disturbance of traffic in Commercial Street was caused by vans unloading produce at these warehouses. They appear to have a privilege under the Charter of taking up space and unloading goods in the roadway to within 3 ft. of the tram lines. Further accommodation is undoubtedly required for this market, the trade of which is rapidly increasing. The Corporation of the City of London in conjunction with the Stepney Borough Council and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police have considered a scheme for providing lay-byes for van traffic, involving the demolition of property and an extension of the market along Commercial Street, but the Market Superintendent is oi opinion that the most effective solution of the difficulty would be by means of an extension in a western direction, with a view not only to the provision of additional space for general purposes^ but especially the removal of the Commercial Street warehouses in such a manner as to clear that traffic altogether. He stated that he had a waiting list of over 50 applicants for stands which could not at present be provided.3. Conditions vj Tenancy. The Charter gives the owner of the Market Rights power to charge tolls on two days only (Thursday and Saturday), the toll to be paid by buyers. To cover the remainder of the period, however, the former lessee established a system of what are in effect commuted tolls, collected in the form of rents from the tenants and from persons selling goods from the market. He also collected a toll from the growers and salesmen of Id. per bag on all peas sold in the market. We were informed that the Corporation so far has not varied these arrangements, but that the continuance of the toll on peas was under consideration. Most of the stands are let at a weekly rental. The warehouses already referred to are occupied by quarterly tenants. In the case of weekly tenants considerable dissatisfaction was expressed at the practice of the former lessee of raising the rent at short notice. In this respect an improvement will no doubt be effected by the Corporation in the direction of the standardisation of rents as soon as sufficient experience has been gained of the working of the market.4. Porterage. The porters are engaged by the stand-holders or the growers and a charge for porterage is made on the purchaser. A revised list of porterage charges has been recently drawn up in agreement between the salesmen&apos;s and porters&apos; organisations. The rate fixed is 3d. per ewt-bag for potatoes and other root vegetables. In this market barrows are used by the porters to a considerable extent, and by this means as much as half a ton of produce can be dealt with by a porter at one time. This method compares favourably with that in vogue in some of the other markets in which the congestion prevents the general use of barrows.5. The railway representative stated that approximately 120,000 tons of produce per annum is brought by railway to London for delivery at Spitalfields Market; of this the greatest propor-tion, about 50 per cent., is carried by the Great Eastern Railway Company. Of the total quantity of rail-borne goods only about 27 per cent, is actually delivered to the market by the Rail-way Company concerned. This market serves mainly the area to the north and east of London and north of the Thames, and most of the produce dealt with by it is consumed ini this area. It is stated that very little produce is consigned to the provinces other than supplies to the towns to the north and east of London within easy reach.6. We are of opinion that definite plans for improvements of the lines recommended by the Market Superintendent should be prepared without delay in order to be ready when a favourable opportunity occurs for carrying them out.
-   120nI). STRATFORD MARKET.1. This market was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway Company and was opened in 1878. This Company had also organised a fruit and vegetable market at Bishopfcgate. It was, however, held by the House of Lords in .1884 that the establishment of the latter market was an infringement of the Spitalfields Market Rights, at that time held by Mr. Horner. A further action was brought against the Company by Mr. Horner in regard to the Stratford Market, but after the decision in the House of Lords an agreement was entered into between the parties by which Stratford Market was to be kept open, JVishopsgate Market was to be re-opened, and the Company was to pay to Mr. Horner an annual sum Axed according to the amount of produce sold in these markets. This agreement, however, was not sanctioned by Parliament, and Bishopsgate Market has not been re-opened. The situation at tbe present time is that Stratford Market is maintained by the Company, and an animal sum of about ( 2,000 is paid to the holder of the Spitalfields Market Right? : this charge is based on a rate of 3d. per ton on all rail-borne produce, and Is, Rd. per load on all produce brought in by market gardeners, ft was stated that as a consequence of this charge, no revenue is derived by the Company from the market gardeners using the market. A portion of the market is set aside for the use of market gardeners who may take stands either on a weeky or a. daily tenancy. The salesmen in the Stratford Market pay rent but no tolls.2. Porterage.--The market authorities do not supply porters or concern themselves with the organisation of this work. Each merchant engages his own men and pays them a retaining fee, with an allowance per package, which is charged to the buyers. For dealing with large loads, hand-barrows are used.3. Accommodation. The market consists of 22 warehouses, which are in the occupation of 28 tenants. The Commercial Superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway Company estimated that the market would double itself if given an opportunity for extension. The Great Eastern Railway Company, although they have a. scheme for reconstruction under consideration, hesitate to develop the market on account of the indemnity that has to be paid to the owners of the Spitalfields Market Rights.   At present the market is used to its utmost capacity.The market consists of two lines of warehouses, divided by a roadway, and fed on the opposite sides by single railway sidings; it is possible to place six trucks in position at the same time, but additional room for truck.- is urgently required. Produce is taken straight from the trucks, in which it was originally loaded, into the merchants&apos; warehouses. One witness stated that the roadway which lies between the two lines of warehouses is too narrow, and described the congestion before the war as appalling; he further stated that the trade of the market has outgrown the accommodation, and frequent delays occur owing to shunting operations. The Great Eastern Railway Company&apos;s representative agreed that the sidings need reconstruction in order to avoid such delays.The market has two exits, which serve also as entrances: these are stated to be very narrow, only two vans wide, and they are badly congested, particularly between 6.30 a.m. and 9 a.m.Tt has been suggested that two additional roads should he made on the west side of the market for the accommodation of traffic arriving after a certain hour.We are of opinion that this market serves a useful purpsoe, and is capable of considerable development. The fact that it lias been possible for the owner of another market to prevent this further development is. in our opinion, a strong argument in favour of our earlier recom-mendation that the whole of the London markets should be placed under the control of a. Central Ma market Au thority.4. The Great Eastern Railway Company does not object to produce being brought into the market by other railway systems. The market has more or less direct connection with most of the Railway Companies serving London, and representations were made to us that a great deal of cartage from stations such as Nine Elms and Paddington could be avoided if through running on rail were adopted to a. greater extent, and the market&apos; enlarged to provide facilities for handling the additional trucks. We have already dealt with this question of through running on rail in Section II. A. of the present report, and in this case we are unable to disregard the railway evidence that no substantial advantages could at present be given by this. The rail-borne tonnage dealt with at Stratford in the yea-r ending November 19th, is 87,436 tons, of which 92 per cent! was delivered direct to the umrkot by rail, and 7 per cent, to the market by Railway Company&apos;s vans.The supplies are derived chiefly from Essex, Cambridge, Lincoln, Bedford and Kent, and consigned almost entirely on the Great Eastern Railway.5. The market deals in all descriptions of fruit and vegetables in general use, very small quantities of the luxury varieties being handled there. Originally the market dealt mainly with potatoes and heavy vegetables, but the want of accommodation and the local demand which has sprung up in connection with this produce has developed the tra.de in fruit, which has had to be provided for by the establishment of warehouses in the immediate neighbourhood at Burford Road.   The traffic to these warehouses adds to the congestion at the entrance to the market.E. BRENTFORD MARKET.1. The market is owned by the Brentford Urban District Council and was established and built by the Brentford Local Board in 1893, under the powers contained in Section 166 et seq. of the Public Health Act, 1875, incorporating the Market Fairs and Clauses Act, 1847. The control of the market is in the hands of a Committee of six Councillors who have under their jurisdiction a Market Superintendent, Constables, Toll Collectors and Caretakers.32498 * 6
2. The South Western Railway actually adjoins the market, but all rail-borne goods are at present unloaded 200 or 300 yards away and have to be carted into the market. It is obvious that a considerable saving oi&apos; time, labour and expense could be made ii sidings could be contribute structed in such a manner that the rail-borne produce could be unloaded direct into the market. Sufficient space lor these sidings is available in the market area, and we have been informed that the Urban District Council has made proposals to this effect to the Railway Company con-cerned which were, however, not accepted on account of constructional difficulties. It is difficult for the Committee to believe that this objection is insuperable, and we are of opinion that the Railway Company should reconsider its decision with a view to effecting, if possible, an improve-ment in the market service.3. Accommodation. At present all available accommodation is fully occupied, and there is a demand for more room both from the tenants in the market and from persons desiring to become tenants within the covered building. The market is provided with wide roadways from which carts can unload direct on to the wagons. Tenancy in this market is yearly, and holders are entitled to six months&apos; notice. Vacancies occurring in the market are filled by the Markets Com-mittee on the advice of the Superintendent. It is interesting to note that at present about three times as many growers as salesmen use the market. The Council has power to increase rents and tolls. A standardised uniform rent is charged for stalls, and tenants of these are ex-empted from the daily market charges. Each tenant is responsible for keeping his stand or stall clean and in good condition.The Market Authorities do not engage or licence porters; each tenant is free to make his own arrangements in this repsect.4. Supplies. The produce sold at Brentford consists principally of fruit, flowers and vegetables, with one stall for the sale of imported meat. All the requirements of a greengrocers ordinary trade can be satisfied with the exception of choice fruits and vegetables. The market serves local requirements for a considerable area, and we are informed that retailers find them-selves able to obtain their supplies without difficulty, the weekly journey to Covent Garden being sufficient for their special requirements.5. Brentford affords a valuable example of the successful establishment of a local wholesale market. It has shown itself able to provide for the needs of a large neighbourhood to a consider-able extent from the supplies which are available within a reasonable distance, and by this means has saved both growers and buyers both time and expense to the extent that it has been able to obviate the long journeys to Covent Garden which were formerly necessary. The actual saving of cartage to the grower for produce coming from the West of London is in this respect 14 miles, per journey, with a proportionate saving to the local retailers who were formerly obliged to attend Covent Garden to obtain their supplies.(Signed)      E.

Note Regarding Railway Transport.  10/3/1921.Whilst agreeing with my colleagues upon the major portion of the Fourth Report, I regret I cannot associate myself with the manner of reproducing certain statements upon the Railway Transport question, as 1 feel that such treatment can only tend to obscure the fundamental difficulties at the Markets and lead to misconception of the real position of the Railway Companies in the matter. 1 consider it necessary to point out that the &quot; Statements by Representatives of the Industry,&quot; require to he read in close association with the evidence tendered by the railway witnesses to the specific questions put, and points brought to their notice, by the Committee. To this end, therefore, 1 wish to record that it was brought out conclusively in evidence that the lack of market accommodation is the responsible factor for any holding back of early morning supplies at the railway termini, such detention generally being incurred at the request of the traders as they could not accept delivery.It is true that certain general statements regarding rail transport delays were made by trade witnesses, but in my view these were largely influenced by difficulties experienced during the war and in the immediate post-war period. In their Third Report the Committee have recorded the satisfaction expressed by traders in connection with the transport of fish to London, and the Committee have also now before them the evidence of the Railway Companies that con-tinued efforts have resulted in the goods trains conveying market produce being placed practically on the pre-war basis.Special reference is also made in Clause I B. of the Report to the necessity for traders resorting to passenger train conveyance at the relatively higher rates for the reason that the goods train services are inadequate. It should be understood that this statement does not concern produce traffic to London, but to outwards consignments principally from Covent Garden Market to the Provinces. The evidence of the Railway Companies shows that in pre-war (fays special afternoon goods trains were run from two of the London termini to the North, but had to he discontinued during the war period. At the present time there is very little produce which would be conveyed by these trains if they were run, but the Railway Companies state they are quite prepared to reconsider the reinstatement of the sendees as and when it can be shown by the trade that there is a sufficiency of traffic to ensure remunerative working.&apos; I have considered it my duty to outline the position of the rail transport question in this way as I feel that no public service is likely to be advanced by statements or charges against the Railway Companies which have little or no substance in fact at the present time.With these reservations T have signed the Report.(Signed)      JOHN WARDLE.
FIFTH   report.LONDON MEAT SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION,To the FOOD CONTROLLER.We have pleasure in presenting our 5th Report which deals with the question of London meat supplies and distribution.(1) We have examined witnesses representing the Corporation of the City of London, the various trade interests operating the markets both wholesale and retail, the Railway Companies, Carriers, and the Smithfield Branch of the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation of Great Britain.(2) The London Central.Markets (Smithfield Market) are owned and operated by the Cor-poration of the City of London under a, Charter of Edward III; and the market rights extend to a distance of about 7 miles from the City walls.(3) We desire to refer to the special report by the Superintendent of the London Central Market prepared for the purposes of this Committee, and printed herewith as an appendix &quot;Appendix 1). This report gives a full and detailed account of the market with many relevant statistics, and constitutes a document of considerable value from this point of view, which makes it unnecessary for us to submit details of the site, construction, approaches and general trade of the market. We desire to record our thanks to the Corporation of the City of London and the Superintendent of the markets for this excellent report.(4) We agree that the buildings are well provided with approaches and traffic avenues, and the area in their immediate neighbourhood is adequate for the receipt and delivery of goods. The general plan is more than equal to the present requirements of the trade and is sufficient to provide for any extension thereto which can at present be foreseen.Some criticism has been directed to the practice of placing meat on the side walks outside the market in readiness for clearance on sale. The recent completion of a shelter extending to the whole circumference of the market is a. substantial improvement on earlier conditions, and we are informed that the practice has recently diminished to a considerable extent. A suggestion was made that a, further improvement might bo effected by the erection of a loading bank on the exterior of the market which might be either a built-up structure, or, better still, consist of hinged shelves. We understand that in many cases the carriers removing meat already make use of boards to keep it from coming into contact with the pavement, and it has been objected that any permanent fitting for this purpose will have a tendency to encourage the accumulation of meat outside the market to a greater extent than is advisable.We are of opinion that the practice of storing meat on the pavement should be discontinued, but so far as this may be impracticable, the use of boards should be insisted on.(5) The sub-structure referred to in the Superintendents report provides a connecting link between the Northern and Western Railway systems on the one hand, and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Compa.ny&apos;s system via Snow Hill on the other. It is used by the Rail-way Companies not only for meat, but as a depot for general merchandise and is connected with the markets by hydraulic lifts, spaces for 11 of which are provided. Five lifts have been installed but only two are generally operated. It is somewhat remarkable that more use is not made of this means of direct transfer of meat from the railways to the market. The evidence of the representative of the Railway Companies, was however, quite definitely to the effect that only a limited amount of traffic could be worked through to this point and that the company concerned could not increase the tonnage of meat brought by this means into the market except to the detriment of other merchandise handled at the depot. Moreover it appears to be considered that the balance of convenience was in favour of the cartage of the bulk of rail-borne meat from the stations of arrival in spite of some increase in cost, and that a greater use of these lifts would involve more porterage as compared with the distribution from vans which are able to select the most convenient of the 31 entrances to the market for the discharge of a, particular consignment. The Market Superintendent and other witnesses endorsed this opinion and we have no option but to accept it.(6) The market provides 364 stalls occupied by 188 different tenants. It is alleged that some stall-holders have a controlling interest in stalls nominally occupied by other tenants. The representative of the Retail Traders stated that this practice existed and was extending in the case of certain foreign firms, and he suggested that if it were allowed to increase without a check, these firms might be in a position to control the prices of imported meat by minimising competition and restricting supplies. It was further stated on this point that foreign firms having no stalls in their own names operated many others in the names of other firms. The Superintendent of the market stated that the greatest number of stalls held by any one firm in its own name was nine, tenanted by an English firm. He was of the opinion that the acquisi-tion of additional stalls by stall-holders was to the advantage of the public, and that the stalls should continue to be allocated to those persons who were beRt able to do large business, without the distinction of Nationality.&apos; The stalls are held on weekly tenancies, and although under normal conditions no goodwill in the holding is recognised by the Market Authority, evidence was given tha,t large sums of money amounting to as much as  15,000 had been paid as consideration on a transfer of a business. The Market Authority does not require the payment of any premium or other consideration-tion on the allocation of a new stall such as those which were made available some little time
ago in the portion of the market known as the &quot; annexe.&quot; It appears, however, that except under conditions such as the latter, which are not likely to recur very often, it is difficult for an applicant to obtain a stall in the market except on payment to an existing tenant of a very con-siderable sum of money. An interest in a stall may be acquired by way of partnership, the terms of which would, of course, vary according to the circumstances. In this way it is con-ceivable that a good salesman who was rewarded with a partnership might ultimately become the holder of a stall without payment of any kind. The Market Authority recognises no goodwill of any kind, and the person paying for a stall or the share of a stall clearly does so at his own risk. At the same time we are of opinion that some limit should be placed on the number of stalls which can be held by any one linn, and also that the absorption of stalls by foreign firms should be most carefully watched.The market revenue is derived both from rents and tolls as shown in the report of the Super-intendent of the market. The Market Authority has the right under its Charter to exact tolls over an area with a radius of %\ leagues, but it does not appear to be in a position to obtain payment of all the tolls to which it might technically be entitled. It also claims tolls on all consignments coming into the market as well as on the declared weight of ail goods sold in the market ex-ship or ex-dock but not actually received into the market area, Tolls are due in fact on all business done in the market whether by tenants or other persons, and it is stated that the Corporation in all new tenancies requires an agreement to this effect.We have not received any complaints as to the efficiency of the railway services in respect of the provision of trains. It was stated that the provision of insulated vans was sufficient for the normal needs of the trade, and the representative of the Railway Companies informed the Committee that as it became necessary to replace this class of rolling stock the Companies were prepared to consult with representatives of the trade as to the most efficient types to be con-structed. During the War the Railway Companies insulated 500 vans to deal with the meat traffic, and these were built in consultation with the trade. The railway representative stated that the companies made provision for the cleanly conveyance of meat, and that responsible officials were detailed to see that vehicles destined for the conveyance of meat were in proper sanitary condition before loading.(8) The rail-borne meat is delivered to the market approximately in the following pro-portions : By Railway Companies or railway hired teams       ...      ...     64 per cent.By vehicles belonging to or hired by the trade......      ...      17   ,,    ,,By lift from the underground station at Smithfield   ......      19   ,,    ,,At this market no complaints were made by the trade as to the late delivery of the rail-borne meat to which we feel it necessary to call attention, and on the other hand the railway representative did not complain of undue detention of railway vans. A very large quantity of imported meat is delivered by carrier&apos;s vans ex-docks and cold stores. No complaints were made in connection with the deliveries so far as regards the facilities provided by the market. The representative of the cartage contractors referred to the inconvenience and delay caused by traders giving insufficient notice of orders, but that is a matter which the Market Authorities obviously cannot control. This witness also stated that the difficulty would be to some extent obviated if the cold stores at the Victoria and Albert Docks were open for the delivery of meat during the night as is the case with other cold stores. Since the evidence was given arrange-ments have been made for this purpose. This witness also complained of insufficient labour at the Port of London Authority&apos;s stores.Meat leaving the market is taken away principally by cartage companies&apos; vans, but a certain number of retailers use their own vans. Very little is taken to railway stations for re-consignment to the provinces.(9) The representative of one of the principal Carriers Companies stated that the vans used for carrying meat were washed out inside every night and outside at least once a week. On the general question of the conditions under which meat is conveyed by road to and from the markets and especially with regard to the conditions affecting the latter, we desire to draw special attention to the recommendations made by the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London in his Report for the year 1919, pages 38-39, with which we are in general agreement (Appendix II.). We understand that the whole question is now under the consideration of the Ministry of Health. We are of opinion that regulations to ensure greater cleanliness in the handling of meat should be drawn up without delay, and the necessary powers given to the Superintendent to enforce them.So far as the Medical Officers criticisms apply to the porters employed in the market, we desire to point out that no provision, except in one or two cases of individual firms, has yet been made in the market building for such accommodation as is necessary to enable the men to do their work under proper hygienic conditions. The representative of the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation of Great Britain stated that there is only a very limited number of stalls where the men have a room in which to leave their clothes, which in most cases can only be hung up in the stall itself. The lavatory accommodation is very deficient, and speaking generally no official provision of any kind has been made to secure the cleanliness and comfort of the men. We are strongly of opinion that an adequate canteen should be provided for the men fitted with ample dressing room and lavatory accommodation. When this has been done the Market Authority would be in a position to insist on rules ensuring that the necessary cleanliness should be observed.10. Porterage.-Under the existing bye-laws the market porters are required to be licensed, and in this sense the word porter is defined as including all butcher&apos;s carriers and the men in their employment, and all men employed in the shops in the market if acting as porters, and
shall not include the purchasers of meat or the men in their permanent employment. The representative of the porters recommended that the licensing system should be extended to cover all men carrying meat in or out of the market, no matter by whom employed. It is stated that this proposal is made as a precaution against pilfering or other malpractices by casual un-licensed men, and by men who may have been licensed, but have been discharged from their employment for such reasons as would disqualify them from holding licences.It was stated by a representative of the&apos; porters that the bye-laws &quot; are exceedingly old and out of date&quot;and that even those which are of vital importance are not fully enforced. An example was quoted in support of this statement ; under the bye-laws the size of the trucks that may be used for the conveyance of meat inside the market is (dearly defined as follows : &quot;No trucks, trolleys, or barrows shall be used in the market which are wider in the extreme outside measure-ment than two feet four inches or higher from the ground than one foot six inches, or which have more than two wheels ;and no quarters of beef or carcases of any animals shall be placed cross-ways upon any truck, trolley, or barrow, nor shall any load exceed in width four feet.&quot; It was stated that a type of truck is now commonly used in the market which is considerably larger than the prescribed size and is capable of holding forty to fifty sheep whereas the trucks formerly used held only ten sheep. The bye-law further states that all truck wheels shall be shod with leather or rubber but it was said that those at present used have iron tyres. It was claimed that these large trucks are a danger to market users and that they restrict labour without reducing the porterage charges on the meat so carried. Other witnesses agreed with the porters&apos; represents tives in the former claim.It was said that the attention of the Market Superintendent had been drawn to the use of trucks of an improper size and the question was under his consideration.Wo recommend that the Market Authority should consider the question of extending the system of licensing to porters engaged in carrying meat into the market.11. Cold Storage.-The Port of London Authority operates a public cold store in the immediate neighbourhood of the market, but there are no cold stores directly operated by the Market Authority. A suggestion was made that it was advisable that a system of inspection of cold stores should be instituted and powers taken to restrict the period during which meat should be allowed to remain in store. It was further suggested that these powers should be vested in the Market Authority, but we are of opinion that this is a. question which requires close investi-gation both from the economic and scientific points of view, and that it is one which should he probably dealt with in the first place, at all events, by the Ministry of Health.12. We are of opinion that it would strengthen the hands of the Market Authority and be of advantage to the general working of the market if an Advisory Committee were formed under the Chairmanship of the Superintendent consisting of representatives of the various classes of traders using the market, including retailers, to which should be added representatives of the railways, public carriers, journeymen butchers and porters. Several witnesses have suggested that in some respects the bye-laws need revision, and a proposal has also been made as to the general use of delivery notes in order to avoid pilferage, and on questions such as these the advice of a Committee on the lines proposed would be of very great value.13. The Metropolitan Cattle Market, Islington. The market for live stock at Islington should in our opinion be looked upon as ancillary to the Central Markets, and its operations be judged on the results shown in the supply of meat to Smifhfield. From this point of view we do not consider that the live stock market comes within our terms of reference, but at the same time we desire to record the fact that no complaints have been received as to the working of this market so far as it affects the wholesale supply of dead meat, and that on the occasion of a visit of the Committee to the market its operations appeared to be conducted in a throughly satisfactory manner.(Signed)      E.

APPENDIX I,LONDON  CENTRAL MARKET.Special Report by hie Supekixtkndent.To the Chairman and Member$ of the Special Markets Committee.LONDON CENTRAL MARKET, SMITH FIELD.Gentlemen,in compliance with your request 1 respectfully submit the following review, which besides containing a general survey of the London Central Market, deals with the important question of traffic or transport; also the eonduet of trade under normal conditions, and embraces the references to the Departmental Com-mittee on Wholesale Food Markets.At the outset, 1 purpose showing that the hue bold arrangement of the Market, internally and exter-nally; its capacity; its approaches, by road and rail, are not only adequate for the present and future needs of the wholesale meat trade of London, but also reduces to a minimum matters involved in the term traffic, or the transport of commodities.Site.Excluding the two retail sections, covering about three-quarters of an acre, the Market comprises five distinct and separate buildings.Four of the buildings stand in alignment on a rectangular site, a quarter of a mile in length  running East to West and about six and a half acres in extent.The site is situated within the North-western boundary of the City, and is defined by the following immediate street boundaries : on the East, Lindsay Street; on the North, Charterhouse Street; on the South, Long Lane and King Street; and on the West, Farringdon Street.It is intersected by three roads running North to South, so that each of the four buildings Btand apart on a section of the site, surrounded by a footway 12 feet in width, and again by roads averaging 38 feet wide.Commencing from the Lindsey Street end the buildings are known as, and run in the following order: Meat Section, East; Moat Section, West; Poultry Section; General Section, with its Western end fronting Farringdon Street; the fifth building, known as the Annexe, lies on a small triangular and separate site of about a quarter of an acre in extent, South of the General Section.The retail Fish and Fruit Sections, rather smaller than Billingsgate, are built on a separate site to the North of the General Section.Sub-Structure and Uses.There is a sub-structure to all the Market buildings with head-room of about 22 feet, and a bas&amp;ment of similar area to that on the street level or Market floor.That of the two Meat Sections is partly occupied as a goods depot by the Great Western Railway Com-pany, and partly by through railway and shunt lines, used by that and other companies.The Poultry Section sub-structure is partly occupied by through railway lines, connecting up with the South-Eastern main line system by way of the Snow Hill Low-Level Junction, and partly by vaults in the occupation of salesmen and the London Central Markets Cold Storage Company.The sub-structure of the General Section, also that of the Retail Sections, is used by the Great Northern Railway Company as a goods depot, and contains the usual running and shunt lines.A further connecting link with the South-Eastern, and other railway systems, passes underneath both the General Section and the Annexe.This link proved of inestimable value during thelate war, for trains carrying men, horses, munitions, and material from all parts of the United Kingdom ceaselessly passed over it to and from embarkation ports served by the South-Eastern Railway and the i-ondon, Brighton and South Coast Railway.In this connection the possibilities of bringing marketable produce to the basement of the Market apparently did not find much favour with the rail-way companies concerned in the early days, for although the sub-structure of the two Meat Sections wus constructed by the Corporation at great expense for the express purpose of having marketable com-modities brought by rail to the Market, spaces for eleven hydraulic lifts were provided, and five lifts actually installed for raising meat from the low-level to the Market floor, only two of the lifts camo into action and arc now in use, one in each of the Meat Sections, both operated by the Great Western Railway Company.Since those early days, however, the growth of the Metropolitan Railway Company&apos;s passenger train service,,and consequent incessant train running, has formed a circle difficult to break through excepting at short specified times, and this to a train contain-ing perishables, and running late, means loss of market.On the other hand, it may be the sitting company, Great Western, found the general merchandise traffic of London more profitable each way than the one way meat traffic, and other companies, doubtless for similar reasons, did not take advantage of their running powers to Smithfield.LViluinos-Internal Arrangement and Capacity.All the buildings contain a ground floor space, allocated to (i.) sales area, by way of shops or stalls, (ii.j circulating area tor traffic, by way of avenues, leading in every case direct to the street; also a first Moor, much smaller than the ground-floor area, used as offices by the salesmen.Each building is provided with bold entrance or clearance gates, for the reception and disposal of road-borne traffic. Meat Sections, East and West, 8 entrances each; Poultry Section 6; General Section 5 and Annexe 4.Of the 31 entrances, the greater number are placed equi-distant on the North and South sides of the (sections, with one entrance on the East and West of each section, excepting. the General Section, which has no West entrance, and, with this exception, every entrance has a facsimile entrance on the opposite side of the section.Each entrance opens on to a traffic avenue, and these avenues range from 17 feet to 13 feet wide, and extend the whole length and breadth of each section, as the case may be.Market stalls abut on to these avenues.A fine example of an internal circulating area is afforded by the lay-out of the two Meat Sections.Each section contains a main avenue 17 feet wide and nearly 300 feet long, running East and West, intersected by three equi-distant avenues 13 feet wide and 240 feet long, running North and South.As previously indicatod, all the avenues are imme-mediately accessible to the exterior footways and roads surrounding the Market.Thus, a person entering a section at the East entrance can easily walk through and pass out by the West entrance within three minutes; on the other hand, if proceeding North to South the tiffift occupied would be lees.A market porter, however, carrying a quarter (if beef (160 lbs.) would accomplish either distance U
still less time, and so would two porters handling a 20 cwt. truck load of meat.This accessibility from the North, South, East West, to any part of the interior of a section, and vice cersa, cannot be improved upon, and reduces to a minimum any traffic or transport problems.The lay-out of the remaining sections is equally good.From the foregoing it will be seen the Market is well planned for serving road-borne traffic, for its 31 entrances can be brought into operation simul-taneously for off loading &quot; inward &quot; deliveries, and adapted to suit &quot; outward &quot; deliveries as circum-stances arise.It is, however, only on very rare occasions anything out of the ordinary occurs. Tho last occasion being on Monday, December 22nd, 1913, when the day&apos;s supplies totalled 4,390 tons.It may be of interest to record here that of that day&apos;s supplies 70 per cent, were made to market shops or stalls before 6 a.m., &quot; pitching &quot; or &quot; in-ward &quot; deliveries commencing on the Sunday at 10 p.m. all gates in use.The bulk of the remainder of this day&apos;s deliveries were &quot; pitched &quot; before 11 a.m. on the Monday, with most of the North and Smith gates out of action for &quot; inward &quot; traffic after 5 a.m. by reason of &quot; out-ward &quot; traffic requirements,What such a tonnage means can best bo appre-ciated by the fact that the great bulk of what comes in must go out again the same day.The internal capacity of a Market is determined by (i.) area of stalls and accommodation, (ii.) dis-position and area of the traffic avenues, and (iii.) frontages of stalls.The aggregate of the areas of the stalls of the five sections of the Market is approximately 193,458 square feet, and that of the open avenues for traffic, 69,872 square feet, as set out hereunder: Section.Meat, East Meat, West Poultry ... General  ... Annexe ...TotalsArea.Shops and Stalls, Traffic Avenues.Square feet. Square feet.55,191 13,20955,191 13,20937,508 24,89235,988 15,3929,580 3,170193,45869,872From this it will be seen that 26-5 per cent, of tho Market floor area is set aside for open traffic purposes, and this, whilst of the greatest value in facilitating movements &quot; inward &quot; and outward, facilitates inter-shop movements; also inter-section movements, by reason of tho East to West avenues linking up ail sections.This, however, is not the most important factor necessary to dispatch, for that, I think, can be claimed by the internal off loading or loading points - the frontages of the stalls.The aggregate of the lengths of the open frontages of the stalls, or internal off loading points, is If miles, or nearly 1 mile more than the length of the footways or pavements surrounding the Market, and therein lies the secret of the Markefs capability to tackle and handle, with ease, the meat supplies of the Metropolis.What the Market containing more than 1.5 miles of meat hanging rails is really capable of accom-plishing will perhaps be better appreciated if the display and volume capacity is given, aftor allowing for runways within the stalls.It is possible to display or hang 60,000 sides of beef at one time in the Market, or say 9,000 tons.Leaving hanging or display, however, out of the question, it is possible to safely pile or stack a similar weight of frozen meat in the same space, and even then leave room for poultry and other miscellaneous goods.This tonnage may be considered the maximum load the Market, as at present constituted, can reasonably carry, on any one day. The heaviest one day load, so far, being 4,390 tons.ExTEnxAi. Arrangement and Capacity.The success of a Market depends in no small measure upon the rapidity in which the daily supplies can be off loaded and displayed in the various stalls,and this again depends entirely upon the capacity of the circulating area, external to such Market.The circulating area immediately without the Market, including Market foot pavements and road-ways, aggregates 193,182 square feet, or about four acres.Of this area 63,450 square feet are on the North side of the Market; 63,792 square feet on the South sidp; both running East to West; and 65,940 square feet in the intersecting roads of the Market, and jinking up the first mentioned roads.I have not included in the foregoing areas Farringdon Street and Smithfield Square; but if, and when, the daily supplies approach maximum, it may bp found necessary to make more use of these fine thoroughfares in the early hours of the morning as temporary lay-byes whilst off loading places are being cleared.As to the external off loading points; these aggre-gate about 3.898 feet in length, or in terms of vehicles 350-3 ton lorries which can be backed in, end on, at one time to the market pavement, and if labour were available and delivery orders clear, to &quot;liable off loading to he proceeded with simultaneously from each lorry, the whole could pull out empty within one hour.Moreover, this operation would not interfere with hand-drawn trucks and man-carried loads from the 11 Cold Stores, which are adjacent to the Market, nor with the working of the six hydraulic lifts in connection with the Cold Stores underneath the Poultry Section and the two Great Western lifts.I am of opinion that with a clear delivery order, and with all the 31 gates, 8 lifts, 350 off loading places occupied by three-ton lorries, and the 11 Cold Stores in operation, together with the first essential, four market porters to a throe-ton lorry, it would be possible to deliver 2,000 tons of meat to the Market within one hour, and without undue stress.I venture to say there is no other traffic centre in the London area where off loading on such a magnitude-tude can be dealt with so expeditiously as at the London Central Market.It is, or rather was, usual for off loading to com-mence at about midnight, and by 6 a.m. most of the &quot; inward &quot; delivery vehicles would be cleared and away.So it follows that empty butchers&apos; and retail meat carriers&apos; vans, when arriving at the latter hour to load for the various areas of London, find ample room for backing in to tho Market pavement.These &quot; outward &quot; delivery vehicles, however, out-, number the &quot; inward &quot; delivery vehicles, and are not of such uniform size as the latter; also they remain longer at market, as the process of loading up is dependable upon the success or aptitude of the meat buyer.Nevertheless, after 8 a.m. ordinary traffic obtains free passage East and West, and after 9 a.m. North and South.A deadlock rarely happens, even when omnibus and other heavy traffic is diverted to Market streets, as on the occasion of City or other ceremonials.Ail credit for this is due to the City Police, who manipulate the street traffic, and to the scheme of streets abounding the Market, which does not permit of a dead end or even a bottle-neck.Thus traffic, which usually becomes impotent as it approaches off loading, or loading points, is, in tho case of the London Central Market, expedited by the facilities afforded by, and accruing to, the compre-hensivo scheme inaugurated half a century ago by the Corporation of London.Approaches Road and Ram.The immediate approaches to tho Market are, in relation to some of London&apos;s main and connecting roadways, moro than advantageously situated, for they the approaches aro just sufficiently near and yet clear of the ahnormal general traffic attraoted by main roads.Thus the roads running on the North and South sides of the Market each links up with main traffic arteries; Aldersgate Street on the East; Farringdon Street and Holborn on the West. Whilst the. road running between the two Meat Sections links up St. John Street on the North, with Smithfield Square, and its outlets to the South, East and West. , ,
The map of London will prove how get-at-able, from every point oi the compass, the Market place is for vehicular traffic.Moreover, the system of building the Market in distinct sections tacilitates the handling of inch traffic upon entering tho Market roadways, for the lour main buildings alone present twice the number of off loading or loading sides than would be the case had the same area been covered by only two sections.That the Market is also within very easy road dis-tance of most of the goods termini, or hist olf loading points, of tiie trunk railways is shown by the following table: -Company.L. &amp; N.

On the spot. &apos;2J miles.8     .,Again, the principal abattoirs of the Metropolis, the main source of &quot; London killed &quot; meat, are situated some three miles away at Islington, from wheiic.&apos; horse-drawn loads can reach the Market in 30 minutes.Whilst the next set of abattoirs in importance are at Ahlgate, and within an easy run of 15 minutes.There are other private slaughterhouses in the London area which contribute, from time to time, a quota to the daily supplies.The dock and riverside system of the Port of London lies further afield, but the distance is being rapidly narrowed by the increasing use of steam or other power for road vehicles.The more universal use of mechanical transport, and the withdrawal of horse-drawn vehicles from the roads, will still expedite &quot; inward &quot; deliveries, and should tend to increase the utility of the Market by widening its sphere of &quot; outward &quot; deliveries to say a radius of 50 miles.The riverside and docks, however, ami what they stand for, are brought nearer to the Market through the Cold Stores that have grown up in the immediate vicinity of Smithfield in the last 30 years.These Stores together have, approximately, a capacity of about 13,000 tons, which forms a reserve supply, on the spot, and a necessary auxiliary to a meat market.The railways linking up underneath the Market, as previously mentioned, are of little account in the direct rail to market system of delivery, for in 1913, out of a total marketing of 432,111 tons, only 10,880 tons, oi- 2-5 per cent., were so delivered, and by one company the Great Western.Although marketable commodities are mostly road-borne, traders and workers at the Market are fairly well served, for it is situated within a few minutes&apos; walk of the omnibus, tram, tube, and train systems of London.To more fully appreciate the adequacy of the accommodation at Smithfield for the dead meat trade of the Metropolis, it must be borne in mind that (i.) during 1913 the &quot; inward &quot; and &quot; outward &quot; weight of produce actually marketed approached 1,000,000 tons; (ii.) all the time there was a How of vehicular traffic to and from adjacent Cold Stores, situated in Long Lane, King Street, Charterhouse Street, St. John Street, and Smithfield Square; (iii.) situated 100 feet from the South side of the Market is the only road entrance to the goods depot of the Great Western Railway, whilst at the Western end of the Market is the Great Northern Railway goods depot, and although the &quot; in &quot; and &quot; out&quot; road traffic of these two busy traffic centres probably exceeds 400,000 tons per annum, only 5 per cent, was on account of market trade; (iv.) the streets, provided and main-tained by the Corporation of London for market pur-poses, are not entirely given over to the Market trade, and (v.) there is room for ordinary traffic moving North, South, East, and West, after 8 a.m., when such traffic increases in volume.The foregoing should demonstrate that the buildings comprising the Market, together with its approaches, are not only adequate for the present needs, but ample enough to cope with a volume of trade far greater than has hitherto been recorded.It is desirable that a Wholesale Meat Market should be easily accessible to the trading community it stands to serve, be equipped for the reception, display, and protection of dead meat, and yet within its immediate limits contain proper accommodation for sellers, buyers, commodities, vehicular, other traffic, and to generally perform the functions of a clearing house.In aft these respects the London Central Market complies, for its (i.) geographical position to the area it serves, justifies the title &quot; Central &quot; ; (ii.) accessibility by road and rail (iii.) equipment for the meat trade; (iv.) ample traffic facilities, and lastly, because its capaciousness is more than sufficient to serve for many years to come the needs of London.In point of fact, the inaugurators of the great scheme for a Metropolitan Meat Market planned, and then built, for posterity.Trade under Normal Conditions.The wholesale meat trade of London is a trade unto itself and has no counterpart, even for comparative purposes, in this or any other country.The majority of the tenants, managers, and workers engaged in the trade are men with many years&apos; ex-perience of the London trade, and in several instances can trace their forbears&apos; association with the Market from its establishment.In normal times, trading at the Market depended upon the ability of each tenant to conduct the volume of business pertaining to his stall or stalls.Thus capability to direct, manage, and to act if occasion arose, were essentials to existence and success.Taking the last pre-war year, 1913, for the purpose of illustrating the conduct of business under normal conditions, the number of stalls, in the five sections of the Market then available for the meat and like trades, numbered 364, and were tenanted by 188 different firms. These firms, according to their principal business, may be placed in four categories or classes:  Glass. , Function.1. Carcase Salesman ...   Buys, and sometimes raises,cattle in this country for slaughter, and markets tho meat and like products.2. Importer     ......Raises    cattle,    or    buys,in other countries for slaughter, and markets the meat and like products.3. Commission Salesman Induces   consignments    of meat, and like products, to the Market from this and other countries for sale on commission.4. Jobber or Dealer   ...  Buys in the Market from either of the foregoing classes of tenant, or else-where, or from each other for re-sale.The foregoing briefly compartments trades, but it does not follow that the functions outlined against the three principal classes of tenant are rigidly adhered to, or that the operations relating to the Jobber or Dealer are his special privilege.For at times the course of trading compels each of the first three types of tenant to undertake one, or even all, of the functions set out.The trade of the Market then was dependable upon an assured supply, due to the enterprise and exertions of the carcase salesman the importer, and the coin-mission salesman impelling a volume of meat to regularly pass through their respective stalls.The Jobber, although mentioned last, cannot by any means be termed the least important in the pre-war scheme of&quot; wholesale meat distribution, for fie bought and cut upTo suit and supply exactly what the retailer required.
In short, by reason of his interdependent position between the bulk wholesale and the retail distributive trades, he was a force of no mean valuo in the Market, and his services to the retailer were comparatively as adaptable as the retailer&apos;s services were to the eon-sumer.The wholesale trade, therefore, had all the advan-tages accruing to centralization, and held a position which rendered marketing and calculations in terms of varieties, quantities, values and expenses easily comprehensible.Competition, however, caused supplies to be de-flected to other parts of the Metropolitan area; for the importer, at no small expense, went forth to meet the retailer, and established wholesale depots, or miniature markets, in some of the outer areas of London.This system of decentralization certainly enabled tho retailer to obtain, perhaps, the bulk of his require--ient.s with little trouble.It, however, limited his range of selection, tended to depreciate his buying ability, and rendored him passive, as though &quot; tied &quot; to or &quot; controlled &quot; by the system.It is doubtful though if the importer concerned ob-tainod a better not sales return on moat thus sold, and 1 am inclined to the opinion that all tho way through the Market net sales return would prove tho best.The system, however, gave the importer greater direct business one hundred little customers are bettor than one big one and whilst thus enabling him to maintain an advantageous connection it also helped him to more easily gauge the reduced demand arising in consequence at the Market.It now remains to bo seen, upon the cessation of Government control and altered trading conditions, absence of credit, and comparative affluent circum-stances of the retailer, whether ho, the retailer, serv-mg the outer areas will be content to accept the trade control innocuously imposed by decentralization.On the other hand, the importer may determine to acquire room in the Market sufficient to cope with the full volume of his business in London.This will moan fewer vendors, but it will place the wholesale meat trade on a clear, clean-cut basis.Economic Working and Adaiinistration.The economic working or otherwise of a market can best be arrived at by contrasting its trading turnover with the charge for upkoop and maintenance of tho services necessary to a public markot.Such charges in the case of the London Central Market (Moat Sections) are represented by tho rents and tolls, and in 1913 these aggregated  138,391.In tho same period the commodities marketed aggre-gated 4321111 tons, so that the upkeep of Market h barely six shillings and fivepence per ton, or -034 of a penny per lb.Taking the value of commodities marketed in 1913 at a flat rate of  50 per ton, the turnover amounted to  21,605,550, and the cost of upkeep in ratio is &quot;64 per cent.Again, taking the population of the area served by the Market in 1913 to be 8,000,000, the charge forupkeep is just fourpencc per head per&apos;annum.Further, the gross return on the Capital outlay upon the Markat place and buildings is 7-8 per cent., and the net return 1&quot;8 per cent.Probably no other market in the Kingdom is worked so economically and on such a narrow margin.As regards its administration, that is deputed by the Corporation of London to a Committee of business rron, independent of the meat trade, and non-parochial in their outlook.This is reflected by the Market as it was in 191.3  the embodiment of efficiency and what a great free trade centre should be open and available for marketing the World&apos;s surplus meat productions.In that year (1913) supplies td Market were de-rived trout the following sources:  		Hatio	Tons.	per Vent.I niuul Kingdom	...    99,148	22-9Australasia	...   103,463	23-9North America...	6,652	1-south America ...	...   172,863	400Holland, Ac.	...    49,985	11-6Total   ...	...   432,111	1000South America sending 66-6 per cent, of the total beef supply marketed; Australasia 60-3 per cent, of tiie mutton supply, and Holland 73 per cent, of the pork,The position the Market holds as the wholesale sales centre for the world&apos;s surplus meat supplies is reflected in the following table:-	1913.

Marketing, however, in normal times, was not an easy problem to solve, ami because of the unknown trend of supply and demand.It may. however, be said of demand that it is nearly constant; for, excepting seasonal variations, it Is immediate, ever present and increasing.Supply, on the other hand, cannot lie termed con-stant, for it depends on (i) marketing, (ii) elements affecting production, and (iii) transport, and which latter, as regards the bulk of London&apos;s meat, means shipments from countries ranging upwards of 12,000 miles distant.In ordinary times distance was minimised by a perfected system of transport, which enabled ship-ments of meat to arrive with almost unfailing regularity.A break in continuity was immediately felt, and reflected in prices; for the greater portion of the supply in those days resembled fresh meat, and, like fresh meat, had to be marketed; cold storage was of little or no avail, therefore no margin or surplus could be carried over for emergencies.On the other hand, an abundant supply of perish-able meat occasionally gave rise to situations beyond control, and caused sections of the trade to under-take additional risks of distribution and recoupment; thus, whilst meat became cheap to the consumer, the latent effect tended to strain the stability of traders and producers.Supplies displayed in a meat market, however, represent some of the money outlay, or capital ex-pended on the various stagos of production, from stock raising to dressed meat, and such outlay must be more than realised to stimulate production to maintain supplies.In this connection the carcase salesman, importer, and jobber, knowing the value of the meat they are marketing and their immediate liability, naturally strive to remain in business by trying to avoid selling at a loss; likewise tho commission salesman. He, how-over, does not necessarily know the actual value of the consignment he is selling, as represented by out-lay, and he therefore uses his ability in sensing the market and obtaining the best price possible for his agency depends upon a satisfactory return to the consignor.I think it can be deduced from the foregoing that whatever the value of the facilities and the economic-trading service rendered to the public by moans of the market may be-1 doubt very much if the gross profit of the various trading establishments in ratio to the 1913 sales turnover averaged 4 per cent., or barely -\d. per lb. there are other influences more domi-nating in their effect  on food prices.There must be a centre for the wholesale marketing of London&apos;s meat, and even were it practicable to establish branch markets in specified areas of London, there would still be a central market, which would have the same attraction for meat traders as the West-end shopping centres have for the rest of the community.The long recognised centre for the wholesale marketing and distribution of London&apos;s meat is Smithfield.So in 1868 the Market was established in this non-productive South-eastern corner of England for the sale and distribution of the surplus productions of other and more fortunate places, to supply the wants of the rapidly increasing population of the Metropolis.That it has done so satisfactorily to the consumer, and concurrently the retailer and producer, is mani-fest by its proud record, which affords ample proof that its medium as a sales centre is sought after and far-reaching.I have shown rather exhaustively, earlier in this review, that the facilities pertaining to the Market, including cold stores, are second to none.In all these respects, and having due regard to the public interests and London&apos;s great area, I ven-ture to say no other meat market, or markets, could be established in the Metropolis to in any way equal the economic advantages accruing to a centralized trade as at Smithfield, and any movement in that direction would not cheapen commodities io the public,Effect and Improvement in Wholesale Distribu-tion.Assuming supplies are normal, I am of opinion an improvement in the wholesale distribution of meat by means of public markets may be brought about by restricting the undue holding up of frozen produce in cold storage. That is to say, a reasonable time limit should be fixed, when all stored produce reaching that limit should be placed upon the market and sold for immediate consumption.This should tend to diminish the speculative ele-ment, always present when supply can be manipulated, and would be in the interests of both the consumer and producer.Producers in this country and other countries should be encouraged to become tenants of wholesale mar-kets, and so market their goods first hand, and this, as far as producers in the United Kingdom in parti-cujar are concerned, should be an objective worthy of their collective action.The proper and rapid rail and road transport of perishable foodstuffs in this country, even to the extent of priority, is essential to the continued success of the London Central Market.In normal times the Market was essentially an early one, and therefore most of the &quot; inward &quot; and part of the &quot; outward &quot; traffic was done, and finished with before other trade vehicles were astir.The tendency, however, is to shorten tho hours of labour and limit such hours to daylight working; but an exception should be made in the meat trade, lor it is in the interests of the consumer that the bulk distribution of meat in the Metropolis be effected early in the day.It would not be disadvantageous to marketing were it practicable to (i.) publicly register prices realised by the sale of consignment of produce, (ii.) show quantities and manner sold, and (iii.) effect a daily clearance of market the adoption of these first two suggestions should cause consignors in this and other countries to accept results without question or doubt, and ultimately prove to be in the best interests of the consignee.Wholesale distribution might be improved upon were production but constant and uniform, for then it would be possible, or practicable, to stabilize meat price by some mutual system which, while safe-guarding the consumer^ interests, would assure pro-ducers a fair and equitabe return, and to wholesalers and distributors a reward in keeping with their important services then, however, wholesale markets would tend to become mere clearing-houses, because of the absence of competition.A semblance, however, of a super-system was revealed by the Ministry of Food in *ih&amp; application of some of the principles underlying the Ministry&apos;s methods of food control during the two most critical years of the War.Such system, from time to time, gave rise to much controversy, especially when it disturbed the serenity of trade interests; but it accomplished its purpose, for food control at a trying time pacified the con-sumer, mollified distributors, wholesale and retail, and set a standard of value upon production.In this connection, bearing in mind the fateful times experienced from the winter of 1916 to the early summer of 1918, it even now appears that something should be done to make the security of the country more independent of outside sources for essential foodstuffs.1 append extracts from regulations relating to Market Traffic Working.I have the honour to be,Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant,H.

Howauth, C.B.E., M.D., D.P.H.,the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London..Food Supplies.Handling of Meat A considerable responsibility rests upon the Sanitary Committee to ensure that the food passing through the City is of a satisfactory character, and the following matters are of interest. Meat is purchased at Smithfield by butchers from all parts of Greater London, and.even from districts outside. It is removed from the market either in the purchasers own carts, or in vans belonging to the numerous carriers who attend the market. From the stalls in the market it is carried to the waiting carts either by the purchasers or by market porters. The meat is either conveyed in trucks which are provided, or on the backs and shoulders of these persons.The number of carts in waiting to receive meat is so considerable that during the busier hours they form practically a continuous barricade round the market. The rear parts of the carte are brought up to the edge of the causeway.These vans and carts carry a considerable amount of meat, in the form of quarters or cuts of larger or smaller size and offal. The division of the meat facilitates increased loading.It often happens that the supply, arrives at the carts more quickly than it can be packed, and, as a consequence, it is allowed to stand about on the trucks for a longer time than iB desirable. During &apos; this waiting period the meat is sometimes deposited on the footway. It should be noted that the section-ing of meat results in large areas of muscular tissuesbeing exposed, and as the cut surface is moist, dust readily settles on it with the resulting disadvantages which are common to dust deposition; dust is excess-sive in dry weather as the streets in the loading-up areas are fouled by the large numbers of horses which stand about. As regards the. pavement, I need only mention that there is considerable fouling of the surface by blood and particles of fat, etc., which are trodden into a hard layer mixed with street refuse. The further risk of contamination by animals is obvious.I have had occasion officially to complain of one more than usually gross instance of piling meat on the ground. In this case the meat was separated from the wet ground by a layer of coarse sacking, the edge of the cover being also practically flush with the sides of the piles. The surroundings were foul.As regards the carts, the general practice is to cover the bottom of the cart with straw. In other cases a kind of sacking is used with or without an under layor of straw, and in exceptional cases white calico or some similar matter is used. Some of the carts do not come to the market in a thoroughly clean condition. They are certainly washed at times but not every day.&apos; The straw may be clean but it is not a suitable material on which to place the cut sections of meat. The cloths I have seen used, day after day, being washed, in some cases, not oftener than once a week.     Blood-stained cloths should be
paulins should be kept in as cleanly a state as possible.5. No driver should be allowed to sit on the consignment of meat even if the meat is adequately covered.6. The various joints of meat as far as may be practicable, be covered on the cut section with grease-proof paper.7. It would be an advantage if sides of beef were covered with a layer of some material similar to that used for imported meat. This would avoid soiling by the clothing of porters, who cannot prevent their over-alls being fouled in the course of a morning&apos;s work.8. In the transfer of meat from the stalls to the vans, meat should not be allowed to rest on the uncovered head of the porter, nor on the cap which he regularly wears. A washable headcover should be used by those men who have to carry such large amounts that the meat must touch the uncovered head.9. Meat should not be placed on the ground whilst waiting to be packed in the cart, even though a covering has been first put down to receive it.10. Wet offal should not be placed in contact with quarters, sides, or other portions of meat without adequate protection against soiling by tho moisture exuding from  he offal.The subject is one, which in my opinion, is worthy of careful consideration as it is obviously desirable that the handling of meat in course of transit should be subject to some form of approved regulations.In January of 1919, the Sanitary Committee again considered the reports of the Medical Officer of Health dated 27th April, 1915, and 25th March, 1916, on tho subject, and after careful consideration and in view of Section 1 of the Public Health (Regulations us to Food) Act, 1907, which confers on the Local Government Board, &quot; the power of making regula-tions authorising measures to be taken for the preven-tion of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food or drink (other than drugs or water) intended for human consumption,&quot; decided to recommend tho Court of Common Council to approach the Local Government Board on the matter. Accordingly the Court of Common Council on the 6th February, passed a resolution that the Local Government Board be asked to make regulations with regard to the handling and conveyance of meat through the streets.Although there does not appear to be any concrete results from this representation, which, I believe, was one of several on the subject sent to the Govern-mont by Local Authorities, I am informed that the whole question of the transport and handling of meat is under the consideration of the Ministry of Health.washed before being used again. White cloths are more desirable, as staining and dirt readily show and this results in greater care being displayed.The procedure during packing is open to criticism. 1 have often seen, even on wet days, men, whose boots were soiled with road dirt, get into the cart to fill the front part, in doing so they soil the straw or cloth at the rear and on this soiled part meat is afterwards laid. If a white cover were used this would probably be rolled up at the back, whilst the front was being packed, and it would be straightened out as the packing progressed.I have seen a dog in a cart in which uncovered joints of meat were lying, and the dog would have been driven away in the cart if I had not objected. My protest in this and other cases was received badly. This is simply mentioned as an instance of disregard of an obvious precautionary essential.1 have seen men stretching over uncovered meat to reach the front of the cart, and in exceptional cases have seen them with their feet on it. 1 have also noticed, at times, meat soiled with roadway dirt.As regards the transfer of meat from the stalls to the cart, 1 take exception to the infreqiuncy of change of overalls by the porters, and to meat being carried on a man&apos;s head when he is wearing a cap which has done duty for weeks without being washed.Meat is not allowed to be placed on the floor of the stalls inside the market, and practically every trader has slightly raised wooden benches. There are no such facilities outside the market, nor are there any powers to require them to be provided.It seems strange that whilst in the slaughterhouses due regard MUST be paid to the observance of cleanliness, and in the markets the traders recognise the advantage of cleanliness and order, and further tiiat butchers at their shops encourage brightness and cleanliness as is evidenced by good lighting, clean benches, bright brass and steel fittings, and clean-looking tiles to line the shop, so little regard should be paid to the elementary rules of cleanliness in the interval which elapses between purchase from the wholesale dealer and the reception of the meat at the shop.I beg to repeat the recommendations which I have previously made:  1. Carts and vans used for the removal of meat should be thoroughly cleansed after use.2. When used for the removal of meat, the floor of the vehicle should be covered with some suitable washable material, preferably white or grey in colour. Straw is an un-suitable material to use unless covered with some suitable fabric.3. A clean cloth should be used to protect the meat from coming into contact with the sides of the cart, and also to cover the top of the consignment.4. The surfact of the meat should not come into direct contact with any tarpaulin, and tar-
FINAL  REPORT.INFLUENCE OF WHOLESALE MARKET FACILITIES on food PRICES.To the FOOD CONTROLLER.We have pleasure in presenting our Final Report, which deals with the influence of whole-sale market facilities on food prices, in accordance with the terms of our reference.This entails some consideration of the function performed by wholesale food markets in the distribution of perishable foods. Such markets afford a convenient means of assembling produce day by day in such a manner as to give retailers an opportunity of comparing quality and making their selection accordingly. Wholesale markets dealing with the foodstuffs with which we are now concerned should have the effect of standardising prices in relation to supply and demand. In order to effect this thoroughly and in a satisfactory manner it is essential that the markets should have ample accommodation for something more than normal supplies. They should, for instance, be able to provide to a reasonable extent for the seasonal variations in supplies of fruit and vegetables and fish (c.r/., herrings), and for unusual increases in the supply due to unexpectedly large crops of particular fruits or vegetables, or large catches of fish. Unless accommodation is provided to this extent the producer and flic consumer may be penalised, the former because he is unable to find an immediate market for bis produce, which by reason of its nature in many cases will not keep, and the latter because lie is deprived of the benefit which might otherwise accrue in respect of lower prices resulting from supplies above the normal.In the case of meat, the evidence laid before us indicates that the market accommodation is probably sufficient as far as can he foreseen. In the case of fish, fruit and vegetables we are not satisfied that this is- the ease, and we have in our earlier reports recommended considerable extensions of the principal markets in London.In the course of our enquiries we have given attention to the possibility of the wholesale market system being wholly or partially superseded by supplies direct from producer to retailer. This method of distribution actually obtains to a considerable extent. So long as the market system is able to standardise prices within reasonable margins those retailers who have sufficient business ability to buy well and at prices in close relation to those obtaining in the open markets would seem, at first sight, to have an opportunity of competing on favourable terms with retailers who attend the markets. It would appear that the former would save the market tolls, the wholesalers&apos; commission and expenses, their own costs of attending the markets and the transport of goods therefrom. The additional handling of goods entailed by the process of passing them through the markets would also constitute a factor in the situation. On the other hand, however, the average retailer would lose the benefit of competitive prices in the wholesale markets, he would not have opportunities of choice of goods, and in the event of the failure of the supplies of his producer he would find himself in a. difficulty, unless he were able to have recourse to a market. In the case of one of the big companies recently formed for the supply of fish either direct to the consumer or through retail shops owned by the company, we under-stand that it has been found advisable for the company to establish itself in a wholesale market.We are definitely of opinion that wholesale markets perform a necessary function in the economic distribution of food, and by reflecting the actual state of supply and demand tend to prevent the exaction of unreasonable margins of profit; and that, so far as London is concerned, the prices in these markets are, as a rule, not excessive for the commodities in general -use.Attention has been drawn by several witnesses to the existence in some of the markets of secondary wholesalers, whose operations in many ca.ses appear to be of a somewhat speculative nature. These men, who are not retailers, buy when they think they see an opportunity of making a profit by a. favourable turn of the market; and, so far as an operation of this kind may he successful, it has the result of artificially raising the price. Not infrequently, however, we are informed that the reverse occurs, but as this class of speculator, continues to exist it is reason-able to assume that on the whole a, profit, is made out of transactions of the kind. It has been claimed that in some cases this intermediate dealer performs a, useful service in buying large quantities and sub-dividing them into smaller lots more suitable to the needs of the smaller retailers. So far as it goes this point may be admitted, but we are convinced that although a good deal of the trade in the market is carried on with not more intermediaries than are absolutely necessary, the superfluous middleman, who should in. no way be confused with the legitimate wholesale distributor, does exist in an appreciable degree. At the same time, without an interference with trading customs, which under present conditions would probably be re-sented, we regret that we are unable to suggest a. practicable remedy.The-producer often complains that his returns from the market salesmen and merchants are insufficient and do not recoup him for the cost of production. No artificial remedy can be suggested in this case. On the other hand we are of opinion, as indicated in our earlier reports, that the producer is entitled to consideration so far as regards his being furnished with the most complete information as to what actually happens to his goods when sold in the market. With this in view we have recommended the adoption of standardised forms of account, in which details of prices realised and expenses are clearly set forth.We further consider that all markets should be supplied with public weighing machines which could be available for use either by buyer or seller when required.Although the question of specific railway rates does not come within our terms of reference we consider it advisable to draw attention to a question of principle which appears to be of great importance in relation to wholesale food markets generally,   We have referred above to
complaints by producers that wholesale market prices do not in many cases cover costs oi&apos; pro-duction. The cost ol goods placed on a wholesale market includes not only the producers costs of production but also the cost of transport, it will be evident, moreover, that the return to the producer cannot equitably be considered in relation to specific consignments during short periods, but should be measured by him on his returns for a complete season, but in the course of which he may have experienced both high and low prices. The point to which we wish to draw attention is the necessity for any change in railway rates being preceded by as long a notice as possible. The grower, for instance, must commit himself beforehand to the investment of his capital and labour in crops the return on which cannot be obtained for a period at least of several months, and in some cases longer. If railway rates are raised after he has embarked on this undertaking his calculations may be adversely affected. He will-naturally seek for those markets involving a minimum expenditure on transport, and the normal supply of goods to particular markets may for this reason be seriously disorganised.Even when sufficient notice is given of a change in railway rates the results indicated in the last paragraph will follow if the rates to the more distant markets are too much for the traffic to bear. This danger especially demands consideration in the case of London, which has hitherto depended, for instance, to a considerable extent on Aberdeen for supplies of fish and Lancashire and Cornwall for supplies of green vegetables. The ultimate result either of uncertainty as to what will be the cost of transport or of too high a cost of transport may well be that considerable areas of land may go out of production so far as concerns fruit and vegetables, and that the fishing industry in those centres farthest removed from effective wholesale markets may be seriously discouraged.We desire to draw special attention to the advantages to be gained by co-operation on the part of producers in bulking their consignments so as to make up units of sufficient size to secure the advantage of lower railway rates. In our opinion this could well be done by local co-operation, and it would have the additional advantage of greatly facilitating railway services generally.We desire also to point out the uncertainty which must always attend the operations of the fishing industry, and in a somewhat less degree of those who engage in the production of fruit and vegetables. &quot;These commodities are highly perishable, and must in the case of fish be invariably marketed as soon as available, and this also applies in many cases to fruit and vegetables, although with such commodities as apples, potatoes, onions, &amp;c, a longer but still limited period is at the disposal of the producer. The producer cannot therefore bargain for a price based on ascertained costs of production as is the case with the manufacturer. He is unable within the limits set out above to equalise the supply of his goods to the market, and he has to be content to run the risk of prices actually realised. This fact accounts m very large measure&apos; for the extraordinary variations experienced in the market prices of perishable foods. It also reacts on the retailer. The consumer, as a rule, distrusts fluctuations in the price of food, and the retailer finds it to his advantage both to standardise prices so far as possible and also to work in the direction of a safe and regular turnover at a price which may represent a fair average profit on transactions extending over a considerable period, but may often be very widely removed from the wholesale market prices of the day. This tendency must result in occasional gluts a.t ports and inland wholesale markets, caused by the fact that the normal methods of trade distribution are not sufficiently elastic to cope with sudden and unforeseen increases in supply. So far as regards the, inland markets, gluts of this kind furnish an oppor-tunity to the hawker, who fulfils a most valuable function in bringing cheap foods to the doors of the poorer classes of the community. This branch of the distributing trade was very badly hit by the War. It is difficult to ascertain how far it has been re-constituted, but we are of opinion that assistance should be given in this direction by such institutions as are dealing with the problem of finding occupations for men who have served during the War.We desire, in conclusion, to acknowledge the services rendered by the Secretary to the Committee, Mr. J. Scholes, O.B.E., whose assistance throughout the whole of this long enquiry has been of the greatest possible value.(Signed)      E. F. STRANGE, Lt-Col. (Deputy Chairman).
