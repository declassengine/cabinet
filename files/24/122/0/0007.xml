[This Document is jheJProperty of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1921.SECRET.--[l*v     C.PtDeputation to the Lord Chancellor, Monday, March 21 1921.(In the Moses Room.   House of Lords.)Present:The Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Charnwood, Sir W. Ryland Adkins, K.C., M.P., Brigadier-General Cockerill, C.B., M.P., Captain Coote, D.S.O., M.P.. Captain Elliot, M.C., M.P., Rev. J. Scott-Lidgett, Dr. Finlay (&quot; New York Times&quot;), and Mr. Sidebotham; the Lord Chancellor was accompanied by Sir John Anderson and Sir Claud Schuster.(Transcribed from the shorthand notes of W. B. Gurney and Sons, 26, Abingdon Street, Westminster, S.W. 1.)The Lord Chancellor : Your Grace and Gentlemen, I am glad that those of you who are present to-day have suggested that you should come for the purpose of holding a discussion as to the present Irish situation. Often when one is dealing with grave matters, subjects which cause anxiety can be discussed with a greater degree of freedom in private than is possible when the discussion takes place in public. This is certainly one of those subjects and this is certainly not less one of those occasions, and I myself have every encouragement to speak with the utmost frankness, because I know that while those who are present have, as all of us have, great anxiety at the existing situation in Ireland, that anxiety has constantly found a restrained and not unsympathetic expression. Certainly no Government can complain of any of the representations or interrogations which have been made by those who are present here to-day, and by the very large number of well-disposed people whom they represent.I have had the duty thrown upon me now for two years to reply when Irish debates have arisen in the House of Lords; and it is evident that no Minister could discharge that duty, not being himself in control of the Irish machine, without a very special degree of anxiety and responsibility. My mind has gone through certain processes in the course of the constant study of Irish affairs which my duties in the House of Lords made it necessary for me to undertake, and it has occurred to me that as a useful genera] preface to any discussion which may take place, I might explain the nature of those processes and the conclusions to which they have led me.it ought, I think, to be recognised that, although in dealing with Ireland there is always a great temptation to go back to the past, the present situation is one to which historical retrospect seems very unlikely to make any useful contribution. Some would carry that retrospect as far back as 1906, or even further; another school would draw useful material for controversy from the Ulster attitude some years later; still a third would found themselves upon the actions or omissions of the then Government after the Irish Rebellion as material for indictment. It is perhaps sufficient for us to realise that the mischiefs by which we are confronted to-day are grave enough to justify, and indeed to require, exclusive treatment.Now, what are those mischiefs, and what have they been at any date that could have been selected in the course of the past two years ? Shortly, I think they are these : that, putting aside the case of the population in a certain area of the North of Ireland, the overwhelming mass of the population in Ireland is disaffected. So acute is that disaffection that it has been, during the whole of the period with which we are dealing, in a condition of rebellion which is only not described unreservedly as being throughout one of open rebellion in the field, because prudential conditions[5972] B
have suggested to the rebels that on the whole better results would be obtained by a j war of ambush and assassination. The campaign has constantly, during the whole of the period with which I am dealing, been in the hands of very desperate men who know their own minds quite plainly, and in order to determine their purposes one may distinguish, first, their ultimate political objective and, secondly, one may usefully make a short analysis of the methods which they have quite deliberately adopted in order to attain that objective. Their objective is notorious; it is the establishment of an Irish Republic in complete independence of the British Empire. No person qualified to speak on their behalf, no person whose life would be safe if he publicly proclaimed a more moderate purpose in Ireland, has come forward or dare come forward, claiming authority to speak on behalf of the only people whose views matter at this moment in Ireland or have mattered during the period with which I am dealing.Let us then face as elementary in the question, that the political objective of the only people who are our formidable opponents in Ireland at this moment is the establishment of an Irish Republic, that no person possessing the slightest authority has come forward with any more moderate proposal; and that if any person did so come forward who occupies at this moment a responsible and representative position, his life would not be worth a moments purchase in Ireland.In the second place, one may attempt an extremely brief analysis of the methods which have been adopted, and are being adopted, to realise the political objective. I have said a brief analysis, because the facts are, happily or unhappily, notorious. The methods resorted to are the methods of murder and any other form of minor outrage which seems at the moment likely to contribute to the political purpose. In many cases no moral justification is attempted for the practices of assassination which have been adopted upon a wholesale scale. Where any of those engaged in this campaign think it necessary to attempt to surround themselves by a quasi-moral atmosphere or any quasi-political justification, they are in the habit of saying that they are engaged in a war; that on the one side you have as combatants the forces of the Crown, the military and the police, and on the other hand you have the Irish army. They ignore altogether the circumstance that the war, as it is called, which they have challenged is necessarily carried out, under the existing conditions, under quite different circumstances by what is called the Irish army and the forces of the Crown. No war, guerilla war or otherwise, in the history of the world, as far as I am aware, has ever been carried on under circumstances which are claimed to be legitimate by those who are determining the policy of the Irish army at this moment. They claim that they are entitled, wherever they see a man in uniform, be he soldier or be he policeman, to shoot him. They claim, if it meets their convenience, that the persons so carrying out these assassinations may wear uniform or not wear uniform, and they expect that every assassination carried out under circumstances of the kind I have indicated should be treated as an act of legitimate war, and they resent profoundly if assassins who have been detected in the course of carrying out these murders are treated as murderers. They demand, on the contrary, that they shall be treated as prisoners of war engaged in honourable combat according to the rules of warfare which have been settled by centuries of international law.If, on the other hand, in any single individual case where the bonds of discipline have been unfortunately relaxed, a member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, be he again a soldier, or be he a policeman, takes the law into his own hands, and avowedly and lawlessly takes the life of a member of the Irish army, or of one suspected to be a member of that army, or destroys property which belongs to members of the Irish military or Sinn Fein party, every conceivable device is exhausted in order to pour discredit upon, and excite indignation against, the forces of the Crown. The irony and the audacity of such attempts would indeed excite one&apos;s surprise if it were not that they have met with quite a remarkable degree of success.What would be thought if any person gravely recalling one of the conflicts of history were to say : It was a kind of a war, and upon each side you had combatants engaged. The combatants upon one side openly and unequivocally claimed and exercised the right to murder from behind hedges or with any other circumstances of i convenient clandestinity individual members of the forces who was opposed to them. They claimed to do this in violation of every known rule of war, and they did it over a long period of time, and they murdered hundreds of innocent men in the course of making this claim effective.&apos; Those upon the other side were bound by rules of discipline, which, under circumstances of the greatest difficulty, and of cruel and
constantly increasing provocation, they none the less regarded, but there were cases  extraordinarily, almost incredibly, few in relation to the whole in which provoca-tion was found too strong for the resistant powers of human discipline, and in these cases there were excesses; that the combatants who had universally adopted and defended and founded upon more or less specious doctrines these practices, thereupon filled the whole world as far as their propaganda could reach with complaints of the isolated irregularities of their opponents, and that they were so successful in their methods of carrying on this propaganda that they not only induced persons all over the world who were evilly affected towards the British Empire to receive and even to credit the charges which they made, but they actually induced large numbers of English people to take the view that even if it were not true, that the balance of censure inclined in the direction of the forces of the Crown, still that in a field in which there had been much illegality on both sides, it was perhaps on the whole somewhat difficult to say on which side the real blame, on a true perspective, rested.Now I should myself have thought that it was obvious that if men of resolution and resource were willing to collect the material and inspire the carrying on, upon so great a scale, of a campaign which had produced these outrages in Ireland, it would not be very unreasonable to suppose that they were quite capable of inventing the falsehoods which, and which alone, in broad perspective have produced an impression in this country, and still more an impression in the world at large, which I, for one, believe to be most cruelly unfair because it is both unfounded and untrue.The methods by which this propaganda work has been done are, of course, extraordinarily ingenious, and in result they have been very persuasive. Lest our admiration should be too unreservedly expressed, we must indeed remember that in many parts of the world they found a very fruitful soil. In the United States of America, and in all the more considerable of our own Colonies, there exists a very large Irish population. The majority of the Irish race who have emigrated have come from the South of Ireland, for reasons into which it is not necessary that I should more particularly enter. They are therefore persons who are predisposed to sympathise with the cause of the South of Ireland, and they are persons who, both in the United States and in our Colonies, have always afforded the fertile and willing soil in which movements directed against the British Empire might throw their roots.There are other, more accidental, elements known to all in the United States of America which lend strength to the Irish movement there; and it is hardly necessary for me to point out that every unproved charge which is made by the leaders of Sinn Fein or the leaders of the Irish military movement is accepted without enquiry and without criticism. These charges were not particularly dangerous as long as they proceeded, and they were known to proceed, only from our notorious enemies in Ireland. They become extremely formidable when they proceed from statesmen and others of position and influence in this country; and indeed, the difference between the two sources of authority is obvious. Our friends in the United States of America, Canada, or Australia, can always discredit reports which proceed from persons who themselves are plainly discredited either by their acts or by their words.It is, of course, a very different matter to discredit charges which are made broadcast by Englishmen of high political position and antecedents. I confess that I am filled with indignation, as I have stated publicly in the House of Lords, when I observe the difference in methods of rhetoric and of advocacy which are thought to be justifiable by the gentlemen whom I have in my mind when they give their attention to the outrages which have been committed by the Irish army, and the outrages, real or invented, which they impute to the forces of the Crown. Their speeches I have read very carefully such, of them as have been reported follow a common form. They begin with a sentence which might have been drafted to serve for all of them. It is perfunctory, it is commonplace, and it is conventional. If it is conveyed in the form of a resolution, it is &quot; That this meeting, while deploring theexcesses of the revolutionary movement &quot;-and then you get the operative part ofthe resolution, which has really been drafted with relish and resource; and the spaces which are bestowed in the speeches themselves upon the two topics are in the same proportion. I do not wish upon this point, at this moment, to say more than this, that the effect which is produced, which is known to be produced, which is reflected in every box which a Cabinet Minister receives from the Foreign Office, is deplorable, is tragically injurious to the reputation and the credit of this country abroad, and leads to consequences which are entirely undeserved, merely because those consequences are the result of a misconception which is spread by the method of treatment adopted and which, for the reasonsl have given, seems to me to be fundamentally dishonest.   I shall select one or two illustrations of that inf&quot;5972] B 2
a moment, before 1 approach the detailed questions, copies of which those who arranged this deputation have been so kind as to supply me with.But before I pass from the more general observations which I have thought it my duty shortly to make, I ought, I think, to deal with a question of great moment which is commonly asked. The question is put: What is going to happen ? Is this welter^of bloodshed to continue? Can you offer any hope for the future, near or remote? Can statesmanship really not attain something better than the reality at the moment, or the prospect for the future bloody, internecine strife ? Is there no possibility of a truce \ Are there no parties with whom at this moment you can deal in Ireland?Well, I will say in answer to these questions that there never, so far as I am aware, has been a moment in the last two years it is not much use carrying these matters back beyond the period of the Armistice, for the reasons I have given there has not been, 1 repeat, a moment in the last two years in which it has not been true that the Government would have most gladly welcomed any opportunity of making what is called a truce with the party in Ireland, the members of which have been instrumental in organising these disturbances. I must, of course, qualify that state-ment. It is obvious that no civilised Government can enter into negotiations with men who have committed, or who have instigated, and who are known to have committed or instigated murders. I do not suppose that anyone, however severe his detestation of the bloodshed which is going on in Ireland at this moment, would recommend that we should enter into negotiations with persons who were known to be assassins.But when we are asked whether it is not possible to arrange a truce, or discuss a truce, or a compromise with other persons, the answer is that we have explored and re-explored this prospect and there are difficulties which any one of you gentlemen would immediately find, supposing that the functions of the Cabinet at this moment were committed to the twelve gentlemen in this room now. Supposing that the Prime Minister said to you: &quot; The Cabinet has a great many anxieties of other kinds &quot; (which is true) &quot; in Europe and other parts of the world, and we wish to divide the Irish difficulty into a watertight compartment of itself, and we put you in charge of it; now devote yourselves to it.&quot; I should be greatly interested in hearing your discussions from the moment that you were charged with the direct responsibility, I think you would go through the same processes that we have passed through in the course of our repeated and protracted discussions upon this subject. First of all, you would say to yourselves: &quot; Before one can contribute anything but useless commonplaces upon this subject we must clear our minds.&quot; The moment you approach a stage of mental clearness, two observations become undeniable. The first is that you cannot make a truce unless you have people on the other side to discuss the making of the truce, possessed or likely to be possessed of plenipotentiary powrers, that is to say, of the power of making effective that bargain to which they set their hands. The second point, which I think would instantly force itself upon your attention and ultimately procure your assent would be this: that before you can attempt to make a truce you must know that the other side are prepared to accept something which it is possible for you in any circumstances to give. In other words, the talk of a truce affords little guidance in the terrible difficulties and anxieties in which we find ourselves if two elements are lacking; if there is lacking, in the first place, any man or any body of men who can come forward and satisfy you that they have the slightest claim to speak on behalf of the people who are actually the cause of your anxieties in these matters; and the second &quot;is that such men, when they do come forward, if they do come forward, should be in a position to make any kind of proposal which is one that the people of this country could accept.Now upon the first point I have little to add to the observations which fell more naturally into an earlier part of my observations. No moderate person who possesses the slightest representative quality has emerged in Ireland in the course of the last two years. I am well aware of the meeting of business men and others which recently met&quot;Lord Midleton on the occasion of his visit to Dublin. The Government welcomed the discussions that took place then. They welcomed them without exaggerating their importance. They will welcome any meeting of well-disposed citizens who honestly address their minds, their experience, and their ingenuity to procuring a settlement; but no one who studied the constitution of the meeting, I think, would make the mistake of supposing that any one of the gentlemen present individually, or the whole number of the gentlemen present collectively, possessed the slightest influence over the 30,000 or 40,000 people, whoever they may be, who constitute the Irish army or over the leaders of the Irish army.  And when we
equally apply our minds to the second of those questions, we are struck by this undeniable fact, that no single man of any influence, of any authority, at the present moment in Ireland has ever said that he would be content with anything less than the establishment of an Irish Republic, and, indeed, that there is not one leader of the first influence who has not quite recently and in the most positive manner declared that he will accept no other solution except the establishment of an independent Irish Republic.Well, I imagine that we are all of us agreed that we are not prepared to grant an independent Irish Republic. If events develop in a manner more favourable than at the moment I myself very clearly see the prospect of, it may be that men will emerge with whom one can negotiate. It may be that a modus vivendi may be discovered under which it would be possible to conduct real negotiations with men who have become aware that the actual purpose, which they have hitherto professed would be the minimum, is not really a minimum. Should such modifications take place, the whole situation of course would be altered, and no body of men could be found in this kingdom certainly not you, gentlemen, who are here to-day in many different representative capacities who would welcome with greater enthusiasm, relief and delight the prospect of any negotiations involving even greater conces-sions which would afford, as we thought, a prospect of real and permanent peace in Ireland.I have made these general observations as a preface to the attempt which I will now make to deal with the series of questions of which you have been good enough to favour me with a copy. But I think perhaps it would be convenient, before I begin attempting to answer the questions, if I were to take one more illustration of the methods of propaganda which are being employed to-day. First of all, I observe that Sir John Simon and others have in plain terms stated that members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces murdered the Mayor of Limerick. I confess I am shocked and amazed that any man who has held the offices and laboured under the responsi-bilities which Sir John Simon has undertaken should have made such a statement in public. It is a charge of murder against His Majesty&apos;s servants. He has been asked, and others who have made these charges have been asked, to produce the slightest evidence in confirmation. In spite of repeated challenges, no evidence of any kind has been brought forward. We have directed the most searching enquiries into this matter. The only evidence which we have been able to procure is that the Mayor of Limerick enjoyed the confidence and respect both of the military and of the police in Limerick and in the Limerick area, I should suppose in almost a higher degree than, or at least as high a degree as, any mayor of any Irish town, except in the Ulster population in the north. There is not the slightest ground, in any evidence which has been produced or which is discoverable, that the responsibility for this murder rested on the forces of the police. But of course the other side, the moment anybody is killed, whoever kills him, immediately say in Ireland, &quot; Another police victim.&quot; That is part of their ordinary campaign; but that it should be picked up and repeated in this country by responsible persons, to be then flashed by telegraph into every part of the world, so that if you open an American paper you read, &quot; Sir John Simon claims Mayor of Limerick killed by British police &apos;&apos; (and the same news is circulated to the immense discredit of this country in every town in the United States of America), I must confess this circumstance does produce in one&apos;s mind the most melancholy and disquieting reflections.Let me put another illustration. The Labour Party not very long ago visited Ireland, and as the result of its extremely fugitive visit-Mr. Thomas made a most inflammatory attack upon the Government of Ireland in the House of Commons. I am not going into the whole of the details of that story in a narrative form, because it has been made a kind of test case in order to brand the iniquities of the police, and I assume some general knowledge of that narrative to*be possessed by the members of this deputation. Since, and in consequence of, Mr. Thomas&apos;s statement a Court of Enquiry was set up into the incidents which took place at Mallow on the 31st January, 1921. An unavoidable hiatus in the proceedings of the Court of Enquiry was occasioned by the fact that the rebels killed the President, Colonel-Commandant dimming, on the 5th March, 1921-a circumstance which did not, I think, elicit any criticism or protest from those who made themselves responsible for the charges to which I have referred. But in the course of Mr. Thomas&apos;s speech he said that Mrs. King rushed in front of her husband and thereby received the wounds that she sustained. That was one of many statements. This is found by a full and very competent Court to be absolutely untrue. The second statement was that a railway man who works in curfew liours must stop on the railway premises all night because T59721 B 3
lie dare not go home during curfew hours. This was volunteered as the explanation of why the men were on the spot at that hour. This statement is found to be absolutely untrue. All railwaymen can obtain, and do habitually obtain, curfew passes on application. Mr. Thomas says in the third place thatMoylan and other railwaymen were searched five times in two different ceils. They were, in fact, searched twice, once at the entrance at the gate and once on admission to the cells, and no more. He says that railwaymen were beaten by the police with fists, revolvers and rifles. The Commission, lifter listening to five military witnesses, to nineteen witnesses from the Royal Irish Constabulary, and thirty railway employees, found that they were not beaten or subjected to inhuman treatment or in any way abused. Mr. Thomas made the shocking statement that the railwaymen were told to run and that while running they were actually shot at by members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. This the Court, after hearing the whole of the evidence, plainly find from beginning to end is utterly untrue; there is not a syllable of founda-tion for it. The sixth statement is that the police and soldiers broke into the refresh-:ient room, took food and spirits and started firing in the refreshment room. The findings of the Commission appended are that a constable did forcibly enter the refreshment room, with the sole object of obtaining stimulants for Mrs. King, who appeared at that moment to be in extremis. His action in the circumstances was held by the Court to be justified. Afterwards the refreshment room remained open and was entered both by the Royal Irish Constabulary and the railway staff. There is no evidence to show who is guilty of the alleged depredations.The next statement of Mr. Thomas in the House of Commons was that Mahoney and others on their way from the railway station to the police barracks were ordered to run and then a volley was fired into  hem. The Court found that no volley was iired into this party by either the military or the police, nor were they, when wounded, fired on by the military or the police. The thing is an absolute invention, given to Mi1. Thomas, of course, by those who were concerned in his employment of it for their own propaganda and who found in him a credulous tool. The next statement is thai Moylan and others were arrested after curfew on the day after Mrs. King was shot and were detained in cells all night, and when released on the following morning were fired at and shot dead. The facts are, as found by the Court, that these men were shot on the night of Mrs. King&apos;s murder while they were being taken from the railway station to the barracks at Mallow. As they went, fire was opened by Sinn Feiners and was returned by the Royal Irish Constabulary. One of the railwaymen, through! the location and character of his wounds, was quite clearly killed by the Sinn Fein fire. It is possible that some of the others were killed by the fire of the Royal Irish Constabulary. As showing the degree of care which Mr. Thomas has thought it necessary to employ before making these charges in the House of Commons, it may be pointed out that he placed the death of Moylamand his companions a day later than that on which it occurred; and that he was quite wrong as to the exact date of Mrs. King&apos;s death even. The dates of the different events as given by Mr. Thomas are as follows : The 29th January, Mrs. King wounded; the 30th, Moylan arrested; the 31st, MoylaiFs death. All the events took place on the night of the 31st.General Strickland, after dealing with the findings which I have given in the order of Mr. Thomas&apos;s statements, has appended a short note to the conclusions of the Court. It is to this effect: &quot; I concur in the conclusions at which the members of the Court have arrived. The result of this case shows it to be one of the grossest instances of apparently wilful misrepresentation of fact that has as yet come to light. All the main allegations have been completely refuted. It is evident that certain sections of the House of Commons and the press are willing to receive and use information without taking steps to verify the facts. The seriousness of the allegations which they make does not appear to suggest to them the necessity for caution or to give rise to any unwillingness to make use of them. What I am particularly concerned with is the apparent readiness to give credence to misde meanours on the part of the Crown Forces on little or no evidence. Absolutely false statements were made in the House of Commons, the main allegations being that railwaymen had to stay in the station because of curfew, and that some of them were shot leaving barracks the day after Mrs. King had been murdered. As a result the services of four officers have been engaged for over a fortnight in investi-gating and reporting on obviously false statements. The normal work cannot be carried on in the Brigade Area if the Commander is so employed; and others no doubt realise the fact.&quot; So in that case, which was made one of the principal illustrative cases, by aman occupying a responsible position in the Labour world, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that every material statement made by him and put
SBinto his mouth, of course, by our enemies in Ireland, has been disproved as the result of this enquiry. But can we paralyse, can we be expected to paralyse, the action of the Government authorities in a time like this, by saying, whenever there is an allegation-tion of this kind, we will immediately direct that an inquiry shall be held, which will taive up the whole time of four officers for a week or a fortnight, in order that they may displace a charge which is invented, in many cases, at least, by the enemy in Ireland, and then is repeated by politicians in this country?I have one other observation to make which had escaped my memory until this moment, We hear a great deal of general abuse of the police force in Ireland. Let us remember what the constitution of that force is, I mean the Auxiliary Force, they are all men who were officers in the course of the war. So far as I know, no man was accepted as a cadet unless his army record was stainless so far as any offence is concerned, and also positively creditable to him. I now let me inform you, because this is not generally known, and the informa-tion is, of course, confidential; let me remind you of what the circumstances were under which the special enlistment of this force was sanctioned by the Cabinet. I remember well the Cabinet meeting at which this decision was taken. It took place some six, or it may be eight, months ago; events happen so quickly. It was a meeting of the Cabinet at which almost every member of the permanent executive, and almost every responsible member of the Irish Executive, and almost every conspicuous person in the police and among the Military authorities was present. I do not conceal from you, gentlemen, this circumstance; the note of all those who came from Ireland at that date was one which, if not of utter despair, was of the most unmistakable pessimism. We were met at a moment when the Sinn Fein Courts were openly and most audaciously usurping the functions alike of civil and criminal jurisdiction. We were met at a moment when the barracks throughout the country were generally evacuated; we were met at a time when vast areas of the country were not protected by the police or by anybody else, and could not be protected by the police or by anybody else; and it is certainly no exaggeration to say that at that moment the actual control of British authority and the weight of the King&apos;s Writ were at their lowest ebb in Ireland; and no counsel upon it was brought to us by those who in different capacities represented Ireland at the moment of that discussion. The Chief Secretary was compelled to inform us that week by week the tale of resigna-tions was increasing in the Royal Irish Constabulary, that no men were coming forward to take the places of those who were so resigning and that a moment would come it might even be that a moment had come when the instrument would break in his hand, which was the necessary condition to the maintenance of British authority, and, indeed, to the maintenance of any degree of law and order in Ireland.It was at that moment that the resolution was taken that a new force should be enlisted. Every step was taken to ensure that the character of the men so enlisted should be the highest possible attainable. It is the belief of the Government that very high character and a very high average have, in fact, been attained.From the moment that that force, the discipline of which has improved, as we believe, day by day and week by week, became organised, the loss of moral, of courage and of self-confidence in the original R.I.C. was immediately arrested. The Sinn Fein Courts were put down. The areas in the country from which police protection had been entirely withdrawn, so that quite ordinary crime flourished undetected and uncorrected, were again reclaimed for order and for civilisation. The recruitment for the original R.I.C., which, as I said, had become deplorable, immediately showed signs of remarkable improvement and, at the present moment, the R.I.C. is being recruited from among Irishmen living in Ireland to a degree which leads to no anxiety at all in relation to the resignations which are coming in.We are convinced that we can satisfy any fair-minded critic that, if he will, make an examination, however meticulous, of what has taken place in the period since which this Auxiliary Force was recruited, if he will attempt sincerely to appraise the provocations which they have received, to understand the circumstances in which they have been called upon to act, he will realise how wide and how cruel this torrent of invention and exaggeration has been.I would like those present to consider this. Supposing that in the course of the war with Germany there had been persons who cared, over a given sector, to collect, to analyse, and to distribute every complaint that was made by the enemy-by the Germans whom we were fighting of impropriety, of breach, of the rules of war committed by our troops; supposing again that such persons had found a body of influential politicians in this country who were prepared to take every opportunity -to give publicity to those charges so made by our enemies, why the whole world, and
certainly the whole world of our enemies, would have been filled with complaints of inhumanity and of crime. It is a novel and disquieting feature that men who call, themselves the friends of this country are prepared to go to those who are admittedly engaged in methods of assassination to found themselves openly and admittedly upon statements made from this tainted source, and then to repeat tliem with little warrant of authority to their fellow-countrymen.I must not be taken as saying, and I do not say, and I never have said, in my public speeches in the House of Lords, or elsewhere, that there have been no occasions on which outrages have been committed by the Auxiliary Force; but I do say this, that you could not get any body of men in the world-and I throw in the Metro-politan Police Force, if you choose, for the purpose of making my claim clear you could not get any body of men in the world, who, having been exposed to the provoca-tions to which these&apos;men have been exposed, would have gone through such cruel trials and risks without complaint throughout all these black months. They have undergone bereavement and the anguish occasioned by intolerable physical outrages to their friends, and, in some cases, to their relatives, and have preserved their shield comparatively stainless as all the records, examined with fairness, and in full perspective, show. I would, indeed, wish, if you could find time, that you should take the total numbers of this Auxiliary Force in the course of the last eight or nine months, take the number of occasions on which they have been engaged under conditions comparable with those of active warfare, take the number of outrages which have been committed upon them and upon their comrades, and then examine, in contrast with those cases, the occasions on which on their part any excess has been proved. It has been my duty to make this examination with a very exact degree of care, and to give a great deal of attention to the reflections suggested by that examination; and I say deliberately that, as an Englishman, I am proud of the record of that force taken as a whole. 1 say, as a Minister, that 1 cannot form a picture even in my own mind of what the disastrous condition of Ireland would have been to-day had it not been for the enlistment and the exertions of that force. The police, as I have said, had broken in the hands of authority, and I do not know-he would be a prophet who would say what would have been the state of Ireland to-day had the whole police force been allowed to dissipate before our eyes, and we had been left to rely upon the assistance of the military alone.Now these are all the general observations which occur to me. I have given them at greater length than I had intended. Indeed, the subject is one upon which there is a very great deal to be said, and when one meets those who are sympathetic with our main purposes one is perhaps tempted to enlarge a little more than is convenient upon these topics. I will now, with your leave, take the questions that are before you and deal with them.The first question is this, under the head of Discipline of Auxiliary Force, R.I.C. (&quot;Black and Tans&quot;) and Auxiliary Division, (a.) Is there any special disciplinary Code for the regulation of these forces? Have they been subject to it since their inception? Is it military or civil?The English recruits to the R.LC. (&quot; Black and Tans &quot;) and the Auxiliary Division are subject to the Royal Irish Constabulary Code.(b.) What are their conditions of service? Are there any arrangements made for their recreation when off duty ?The &quot; Black and Tans,&quot; as they are called, are sworn in as ordinary recruits, and are if so facto permanent members of the R.I.C. The Auxiliaries are ex-officers of the British army, enlisted as Cadets for one year&apos;s service. Arrangements for recreation are made subject to the considerations of safety and location. The Auxiliary Company at Kilkenny, for instance, is encouraged to play football, being so situated that they can do so, when they have time, without fear of molestation, and at Gormanstowh Camp facilities are provided for all sorts of games indoor as well as outdoor. To a Company in Dublin this would be more difficult, but the whole question of recreation is not lost sight of and improvements are being made.Then (c). Have there been many cases of admitted indiscipline? Are the numbers of these cases on the increase or decrease ? What special recent measures have been taken to restore discipline ? In particular is there much drunkenness, and how is it dealt with ?Then question (/) I take with that. What are the general prospects of success-fully restoring discipline?(c) and (/). No, the cases of ordinary indiscipline, by which I mean acts of disobedience to superior officers, offences punishable under the R.I.C. Code, &amp;c, have been, considering the circumstances, surprisingly few.  General statements
that Black and Tans &quot; are frequently drunk on duty are often made but seldom substantiated. Cases of looting have been investigated and offenders have been punished. A Senior Military Officer has within the last few days been appointed to General Tudor&apos;s staff at Police Headquarters, Dublin, as Director of Personnel and Administration, which should make the task of restoring complete discipline a matter of comparative ease, since it will free General Tudor himself from much work of detail; and orders have again recently been issued to local police officers, impress-ing upon them the importance of the strictest discipline among the men under them.Question (d). How are Commanding Officers selected? What check is there on them? Have they any administrative duties, e.g., do they serve on civilian Court Martial?It is clear from the above that the so-called &quot; Black and Tans &quot; are officered by the regular R.I.C. officers. The Auxiliaries are divided into companies, and the Company Commanders were selected from the enlisted Cadets by the Commandant of the Auxiliary Division, who chose the man in his viewr most suitable to hold such command, and who was usually the one having the highest army rank. No Cadet wras enlisted at all without a reference to his War Office record. These Company Commanders are directly responsible for the discipline of their companies to the Commandant of the Division, himself responsible to the Chief of Police. They are never called upon to fulfil such administrative duties as sitting on Courts Martial to try civil prisoners.(e.) Has the Government come to any decision upon the question of putting all the Crown forces under military discipline with a unified command ? Are they considering the question of the concentration and redistribution of their forces upon any altered strategical plan, e.g., the South African model?I understand that the Government have had under consideration the question of unification of command, and that the view has been pressed upon them in certain quarters that such a step would greatly improve their efficiency as a fighting force, but I am not aware whether any change is contemplated. Such unification could, in fact, be accomplished only by the extension of martial law, now in force in eight counties, to the whole country. Less drastic steps matters more of internal economy than Government policy might succeed in bringing the civil, military and police heads into closer liaison, and thus secure better co-operation, but if a change is thought to be necessary the general extension of martial law is in all probability the simplest and best method, and anything less would turn out to be merely two bites at a cherry.The next is II. Murders, (a,) Who are the murderers ? Are they crooks or fanatics ?   Are they imported or indigenous ?Captured documents have established that the murder gang are, I should say, invariably members of the Irish Republican Army. They are certainly indigenous; rumours of imported bravos have never been confirmed. There is certainly an element who are in the job for money, and who to that extent may be classed as crooks, but the great majority of the Irish Republican Army rank and file are brought into the business by fanatical and mistaken patriotism and by the halo of romance which has always&apos; rested on the head of the young Irish rebel. Some there are who are brought in, and still more who once in are kept in by fear of the consequences if they were to desert, but it is not likely that this breed is trusted with the more important jobs.(&amp;.) What is the estimated number of rebels under arms? Is it increasing or decreasing? What special centres of disaffection are there, and for what reasons does the disaffection vary in different parts of the country, e.g., why is Limerick quiet ?   How has a truce been established in Tuam ?The best estimate that can be made of the active members of the Irish Republican Army who attend parades for purposes of drill and could be put into the field under arms is about 30,000. The actual paper strength of the rebel army is probably more than double this. We may presume that the young fanatics are already there, and that no very considerable number of recruits now comes in from that element. They are on the other hand undoubtedly gaining recruits by reason of unemployment. I do not agree with the suggestion in the latter part of this question that special districts are noticeably less or more disaffected than others. Certainly there is great variation in the degree of rebel activity in different places, usually due to the lethargy or otherwise of the&apos; local company or brigade of the Irish Republican Army, which in its turn may be due to the personality of the commander, the amount of breaking up which they have suffered at our hands, or the amount of stimulus which has been administered to them from headquarters.   Of course, in some cases the personal
influence of a priest or other dominating person of influence, the removal of some individual had man or the presence of a good Auxiliary Company or particularly efficient and tactful District Inspector may make for especial quiet.Then (c) and (e) I will take together. What is the progress of the campaign of pacification ? How far is murder throttled ? What are the prospects, if any, of (1) breaking armed resistance, (2) stopping assassination ? Does a moderate element exist (i) in the country, (ii) in the Sinn Fein councils, and what is its strength ?This is as a question a pretty tall order, and I can only answer it generally and very guardedly, as it is mainly in the realms of prophecy dangerous anywhere, usually fatal in Ireland. Our campaign has certainly progressed slower than we all hoped and most expected. How far they are sick of it, I do not know. There are signs innumerable that moderate elements all through the population look for peace with increasing anxiety, and there is undoubtedly a body of opinion in the councils of Sinn Fein who would welcome a way out of the hopeless mess into which their methods of supporting an agitation for an Irish Republic have plunged their country, The so-called extremists themselves undoubtedly contain such an element, but while the Republican Party continue to distrust the good intentions of the Government and, at the same time, to distrust themselves and each other to the extent of declining to be lured into any sort of negotiation or statement of basis for settlement, the strength of such element is hard to gauge. Meanwhile, we cannot say that murder is throttled, and continued outrages on the part of the Irish Republican Army seem to call for increasing and more drastic measures of repression on ours. In reply to the direct questions (1) and (2) in paragraph (c) of the Questionnaire, I cannot conceive that the armoury of the British Empire does not . contain weapons capable of doing both.(d.) Has the import of arms been stopped ? Is there a naval blockade ? Where do the rebels get their arms from?I dare not say that the import of arms has been stopped. There is no naval blockade of the Irish coast. Incoming ships are searched as far as possible by customs and police officers and any special ship or port about which we get information is, of course, the subject of special attention. There is no evidence that arms to any extent are being imported at present.Then III. Reprisals, (a.) Can the responsibility be assessed as between (i) soldiers, (ii) old R.I.C., (iii) new R.I.C. (Black and Tans), (iv) Auxiliary Division?I do not feel inclined to do this; there is much too much inclination already to consider our forces as separate entities, (i), (ii), and (iv), that is, soldiers, old R.LC, and the Auxiliary Division, have all been at one time or another charged with reprisals; (iii), that is the new R.I.C., as I have already said, are part of (ii), that istheoldR.I.C.Then (b) and (c). What has been the effect of authorised reprisals? Do they encourage indiscipline? What publicity is given to authorised reprisals? Under whose authority are placards threatening police reprisals issued ?Authorised reprisals are carried out in the martial law area on the orders of the Military Governor of the area, and when houses have been burned on such order due notice has been given and full publicity has been given to the event in the news-papers. The effect of these authorised reprisals is a matter of conjecture. The nouses destroyed usually turn out to be the property of respectable absentee landlords, and though such reprisals undoubtedly terrify the inhabitants, it is doubtful whether they affect the Irish Republican Army one way or the other.(d) Why cannot the summary of the findings of Courts of Inquiry be published in every case ?A Court of Inquiry, unlike a trial, is essentially private, and it would be impossible for the Government to promise in advance that they would throw open to the public and the press every inquiry which they might wish to hold, or to publish in every case the findings. It is essential that the Government retain the right to be the judge of this in each case.TV. Peace efforts, (a.) What is the possible effect upon the Irish situation of the Ulster elections? Will Ulster be Hibernia Irredenta&apos;1. What will be the result upon border counties, Tyrone and Fermanagh ? Will Ulster be an irritant or a working model? There seems good reason to hope that if Ulster sets up her Parliament, gets the thing working, and begins to show signs of success, disappoint-ment in the South, which is laying the flattering unction to its soul that the Belfast Parliament&apos; will he a complete fiasco, will be succeeded by jealousy. To this extent there will be an irritant, but an irritant which will, like as not, spur the South with envious desire.   They could not, I think, fail to see who had got the wrong end of the
stick in a partition which gave a Parliament to the North and Crown Colony Govern-ment to the South.(b) and (c). Is there any chance of peace with the South, by truce, armistice or amnesty ? Why did the December truce break down ? What are the prospects of discussion with (i) elected ad hoc Assembly (Vincenfs proposal), (ii) a Conference (-Lord Midleton&apos;s proposal), (iii) Dail Eireann?I can deal with these in a few words; of course there is a chance of peace coming to this distracted country by any of these channels. The Government is anxious for peace, and is ready to treat as soon as the other side will sufficiently overcome their distrust to come forward and do so. The December truce broke down on the question of surrender of arms, and without surrender of arms a formal truce is next door to impossible, as we could not guarantee that it would be kept; an informal, unofficial truce would be comparatively easy and would indeed in all probability follow auto-matically the opening of pourparlers, I do not appreciate the difference in this connection between truce and armistice; and the question of amnesty would not arise until the stage of full peace negotiations had been reached.I have already dealt generally with the three sub-heads in the last paragraph of the questionnaire when I say that peace may come by any channel; the most likely may fail, the least likely may succeed, but such acquaintance as I have with confer-ences in this country makes me doubt them profoundly. A conference in Ireland always seems to be captured by the most noisy and less businesslike members of the community, and of the three alternatives suggested in the question, Dail Eireann seems to be the most hopeful. The fewer negotiators the better, provided that those who do negotiate with us carry guns enough to speak with authority.Now, gentlemen, as you know, I have very shortly to resume my duties as Speaker of the House of Lords. When I gave my mind to the length of these proceedings it became evident to me that I had somewhat underrated the time which my own exposi-tion of things would require, and I came to the conclusion that it was not quite fair to those who have also given great attention to this matter, that I should expect them to make observations, or to ask questions in the light of the statement which I have made and the information which I have given, without the intervention of a slight period for reflection. I would therefore suggest for your consideration whether you might not fix upon some day suitable to yourselves, and, when you have had time to give such consideration as is possible to what I have said, I should hold myself entirely at your disposal to resume this discussion when you have time to consider it, if that is convenient to your Grace and to you, gentlemen. Perhaps you will discuss it with Sir Claud Schuster.Sir Ryland Adkins : Would it be possible for us to have a copy of what you have said to us ?The Lord Chancellor : 1 should like you to have a copy. The trouble, of course, is that when you once get in print twelve copies of something which is very private and confidential, one is hardly disposed to risk it, even with people of the best intentions and the utmost degree of integrity in the world; but under a very special undertaking that this shall be kept under lock and key, and carefully kept under lock and key, it might be done.Sir Ryland Adkins : I would undertake to do that.Sir Claud Schuster : Perhaps it would not be necessary to give everybody a copy; that would take a long time.The Lord Chancellor: It is understood that this will be regarded as under very special confidence.Lord Charnwood : I would rather not possess one, personally.Sir Ryland Adkins : I will give that undertaking.lord Charnwood : We should like to thank you for the opportunity you have given us to meet you to-day.
