Mr. Longhurst

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

CONFIDENTIAL.

C.P. 2861.

CABINET

THE COAL DISPUTE.

LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE MINING ASSOCIATION.

10 Downing Street, S.W.l.

21st April, 1921.

Dear Mr. Williams,

During the past week several statements have been made in the Press by both parties to the dispute, and numerous suggestions have been put forward by persons who are not parties to it. I trust that your Association will take the earliest opportunity of meeting the Miners&apos; Executive and myself in order to explore the question whether anything emerges from these statements and suggestions that might load to a settlement of the present dispute.

In these circumstances, as I am compelled to leave town early on Saturday to meet the French Prime Minister, I invite your Association to meet the Miners&apos; Executive and myself at the Board of Trade offices at 3 p.m. to-morrow afternoon, and I shall be grateful if you can let me have an early reply.

Yours faithfully,

(Sgd.) D. LLOYD GEORGE.

Evan Williams, Esq., Mining Association of Great Britain.
