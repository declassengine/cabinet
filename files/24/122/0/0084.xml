Recommendations of Supply Priority Sub-Committee.

STREET AND PUBLIC LIGHTING

Reduction of 50% compared with same period last year already called for but subject to Police Requirements. Recommendation

Reduction to 25% in large towns and complete discontinuance in rural areas.

TRAIN SERVICES

Passenger services now reduced by end of week to 50% of normal.

Recommendation

Further reductions to what might be termed "omnibus" services, viz. heavy trains, frequent stops, slow speeds. Exceptions Business and Suburban services to be cut 50%. People should be strongly exhorted not to travel. Sunday services to be entirely suspended.

Freight. Stop all rough traffics i.e. all traffics in classes A, B and C except such as required for vital services. This will inevitably bring to a stand the bulk of industry other than food manufacture.

Business services to be reduced to 50% of normal.

All pleasure services to be suspended.
