ocu..       s tlis Property ofCirculated by the Secretary of State for India. - *SECRET,&apos;^ft   2043   Jcj)i have read 1 h\ Addisun s Momoraudnm, and would ask for an early rlafc for discussing Ireland in accordance with the decision readied just before Easter. 1 do nol disregard the intense preoccupation of His Majesty&apos;s Government at t he moment, but this matter seems to me to be one of such urgent importance as to justify the request.J should like the Prime Minister to announce publicly his willingness to grant a truce for the discussion ol: such amendments to the Government ol Ireland Act as will make it acceptable to the people ol Southern Ireland. J should like this public pronouncement coupled with some indication of the steps that Government would be prepared to recommend to Parliament, provided the Prime Minister was assured that peace in Ireland would result therefrom. I should like it also lo be stated that the Government were not prepared to recommend any changes unless peace was assured as a consequence.J agree with Dr. Addison that the change which wo could contemplate could only be fiscal autonomy. But J think it ought to be clear that we arc not now in a position to grant fiscal autonomy to Southern Ireland under conditions which would prejudice the terms upon which the people of Northern Ireland had accepted the Act. It should, therefore, be made plain, in my opinion, that the Parliament ol&apos; Southern Ireland would not be empowered 16 discriminate in their tariffs against Acts of British origin, and that the Parliament of Southern Ireland would not be empowered to tax goods of North of Ireland origin.As regards Imperial contribution, it is to my mind impossible, that Southern Ireland is to be allowed to escape from any share of the British National Debt. But I do not think we can possibly secure peace in Ireland except by expressing our willingness to leave the ainouut to be determined between the Government of Southern Ireland and the Government of Great Britain with some machinery for arbitration in case of disagreement.I am convinced that negotiations are impossible unless a truce is obtained, and I want to make it quite clear that the truce 1 contemplate is a truce without prejudice. I think a truce in this connection merely means standing at arms. Nobody is withdrawn and nobody is disarmed. To ask for an amnesty for political prisoners as part of a truce, or to ask for the surrender of arms are demands appertaining to a peace and not to a truce.I cannot see what the objections to such a truce are. It is possible that it will be broken. It is possible that the discipline among the assassins of the Irish Republican Army is not sufficiently strong to prevent outrages occurring during the truce. It is just possible, despite the efforts of Sir Ilaniar Greenwood and General Macreacly, that the discipline in the forces of the Crown is not yet sullicient to prevent unauthorised action, which 3779     100 4.21
would break the truce. An incident of certain kind would atTonce-fce the subject-matter for a protest by one side or the other, relfej^inj^ if ii is deemed right, by the protesting side breaking oil&apos; negotiartons**as the consequence of the truce not having been observed.,--Thus it will be seen that the truce 1. advocate is a truce lor negotiation before the appointed day, 1 must say that 1 regard with the profoundest misgiving the arrival oi the appointed day without any new oiler from His Majesty\s Government, without a definite oiler, a public offer, an offer of a truce for negotiations, and a declaration of willingness to accept fiscai autonomy. 1 regard with even greater misgiving a truce over the elections; for I feel almost certain that if such a truce takes place it will merely facilitate the election to the new Irish Parliament of men pledged anew to an Irish Republic which will enormously increase the difficulties of getting, a settlement, How can it be otherwise ? What is the situation to-day? The Government stands iirm publicly to its Act. Southern Ireland does not approve the Ac&apos;.. Failing any new move by the Government, Sinn Fein candidates are certain to appeal to the people to register their dissatisfaction with this, apparently the last word of the British Government, by a renewed decision to break the British connection.It is this conviction on my part which makes me feel that the appointed day at once sets a term to our opportunity and presents new definite and great danger. It is because ol&quot; tins that, notwithstanding the strike in this country, 1 urge immediate decision.10, S. M.J4th April 1021.
