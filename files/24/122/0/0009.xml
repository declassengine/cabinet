10 Downing Street, S V 1 Aprll*3tli,1921tDear l..;r. Hodges,I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of this morning.     You state that ycudeslro to bo 1&apos;roe to discuss fully every aspect of the present situation with a view to ai riving at a speedy and honourable conclusion.    This is also the wish of the Government.    ^o have never suggested that anj limitation should be imposed upon discussion, but as regards the order in which matters are to be discussed the national interest in the preservation of the mines is paramount and It must take first placo.    While the mines are hourly being flood-ed and ruined and one of the most valuable of national assets being destroyed it is impossible to expect other questions to be debated.    Accordingly the question of the safety cf the mines must first be discussed and disposed of before other matters are taken up.I therefore invite you to a Conference in this sense and will be glad if representatives of your Federation will attend at the Board of Trade this afternoon at 3 o&apos;clock for this purpose.Yours faithfully,(Sighed)   D. LLOYD GEORGE,
