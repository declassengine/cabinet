The survivors of the garrison succeeded in effecting their escape from the building which was then almost entirely consumed by fire     There was no loss of arms or ammunition.Seven other occupied Police Barracks were attacked during the week but in each case without success, and except in:the case of Lechy Road Barrack, Londonderry, in which a constable
was dangerously wounded, without less to the defending garrisons.On the 30th ultimo, a cycle patrol consisting of a Eeaa Constable, a Sergeant and two Constables has   ambushed at Baily-fermott, Co. Dublin,     The Serjeant was killed and the Head Constable and me rf the two Constables were seriously wounded. In addition to the casualties sustained in ambushes and barrack attacks, two policemen were murdered in   cold blood, one in Miltown-Malbay, Fnnistymon District, Co, Clare, on the 31st ultimo, and the other in Londonderry City on the 1st instant. Ten Sinn Fein murders of civilians wore reported during the week, the victim in one case being a temporary employee (engaged on ordinary clerical duty) in one of the Departments of Dublin Castle.     Minor outrages during the week included 26 raids on mails, 8 raids for arms, and 34 raids on the offices of rate col-lectors and Petty Sessions Clerks.     Sums of money amounting to a total of  875.1,9 were taken from the offices of Clerks to Petty Sessions,Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 61 for the week.Trials of Civillans^by Court Martial*,Sixty trials of civilians by Court Martial were concludedduring the week.

APrOPMW? OF m&quot;l LORD LPflJTTXCT.The announcement of Lord Edmund Talbot&apos;s appointment as the first Lord Lieutenant of Ireland under the new Constitution established by the Government of Ireland Act has, on the whole, been not unfavourably received.   Even the &quot;Freeman&apos;s Journal&quot; while professing scepticism as to the good results to be expected from the appointment, in view of Lord Edmund&apos;s former antagonism to Home Rule, is constrained to admit that his coming marks the disappearance of the last religious barrier agiinst the political liberty of the Irish people.(InM)   IRQ.Chief Secretary&apos;s Office, Dublin Castle,April 6th,1921.
