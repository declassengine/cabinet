IRELAND FOR THE W3EK ENDED 2oth APRIL, 1921.(Circulated &quot;by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.)I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the weak ended the 25th instant. GENERAL STATE Oi&apos; i&apos;irO COUNTRY,, Statistics of Outrabes.The return oJ outrages for tho weok ended the 23rd instant points to a certain increase c7 effort on the part oi the robsl military organisation.    Attacks on Crown forces reached the exceptionally high total of 46 for the week, and included 17 attacks on occupied police barracks. The majority of the latter attacks were obviously not intended as more than harassing operations in accordsnce with the following instructions contained in the same i^suo of the &quot;AN T-OGLAC&quot; from which I quoted in my last weokTs report.&quot;There is not enough systematic sniping at Police Barracks;   this is because the value of such action is . not sufficiently realised,   We can best show what is meant by an example.   Take a supposed Brigade Area which covers a medium   sized country, and assume it is what the enemy would like to call &quot;a quiet district&quot;; The only enemy forcos in such an area may be about 100 police in half a dozen barracks.     Such a force is not formidable and yet the Brigade Commandant is at a loos to deal with it.    His forces aro not strong enough, nor sufficiently vne 11 &quot;trained to attack the enemy posts in a regular way, and no chance seems to offer of capturing them by stratagem.   How then is he to deal with them.The answer is that he must worry them by sniping I tactics and compel their withdrawal in that manner.I Where the enemy forces are as v$ak numerically asI that there is no reascr? Why they should ever get a nigET7^ *sTeepa   &quot;  Their bliiracls should be fired into
night after night anci they should be kept in a constant state of uneasiness and nerves,   The first shot arouses the uhole garrison, and a few shots at intervals aftor that is sufficient to keep then awake all ni^ht.      Ml this offset can bo obtained by two or three men firing a few shots. In several instances the ovacuation of enemy posts has been compelled by this method&quot;.The last sentence quoted is wholly untrue and the police reports of their operations do not suggest that they are having any of the othor effects intendod.   Tho morale of the polioo forcos was never higher that at present, and is not likoly to be undermined by taotios which aro admittedly based on an &quot;inability to attaok the enomy posts in a regular way.&quot;    Only one police casualty, a case of slight wounding was sustained in this series of &quot;sniping&quot; attaoks, and no damage was done to the   barracks in any case.An attaok made on Kilrusb Barraok, Oo. Clare, on the 22nd instant was more than a sniping operation and would appear to have boon undertaken with tho intention of capturing the barrack.   Tho military barraok and a Marino post at tho Coastguard Station were attacked at tho same timo and it is estimated that a forco of more than 160 rebels wero engaged in these attacks.    Tho attempt proved completely unsuccessful in each case but one casualty (a case of wounding) was sustained by the military in a counter attack, and a sergeant of tho Royal Irish Constabulary was shot dead in the town while the attack on tho barraok was proceeding.    Two marines wore ca tured unarmed in the town but were released uninjured aftor being detained j.s   in for two hours.    A soldier who was also captured unarmed suooeeded in effecting his escapo but was wounded in doing so.Tne other important enaounters with rebol foroes took
place during the week.   On the 22nd instant a part,, of 15 military with a G.S. Waggon wore ambushed at Curragh-olooney, Cahir District, Co, Tipperary by about 100 rebels, but after a short engagement in which 3 soldiers were killed the rebels abandoned the attack.   A District Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary who was returning from Clogheonin his private motor car ran into the ambush and has not sinco been heard of.   His car which v/as found nee,r the scene bore several bullet marks.   The other encounter was an ambush of a police patrol near Kilmilkin, Co. Galway on the 23rd instant.   After an engagement lasting from 4.15 a0mo to 3.30 p.m. in whioh one Constable was killed and two woro wounded, the rebels withdrew to tho mountains taking with them their casualties which are bolievod to have boon considerable.Ho less than sis cold blooded assassinations of poliec-men wore perpetrated during tho week.   Two of these murders occurred in Jolf^et City the vicfjn being Cadet3 of the Auxiliary Division.In addition to the casualties due to Sinn IPein outrages, which numbered in all 30 for tho week (9 police killed and 11 wounded, and 3 military killed and 5 wounded), I regret to state that 3 police (including a district Inspector) were killed and 4 more wounded in two unfortunate occur-renoes in which parties of Crown Forces camo into collision through mutual mistake as to each others1 identity.    One of these incidents took place at Castleoonnel, Co. Limerick on the 17th instant, and tho other near Swords, CcDublin on the night of the 23rd-24th instant..   An official inquiry is being held into each of these occurrences.Two Sinn Fein murders of civilians took place during
the week, one of tho victims &quot;being a Protestant farmer and the other an ex-soldier,,Minor outrages for the- week included 74 raids on mails end 4 raids for arms0Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 107 for tho week.Trials of Civilian by Court Martial.iifty-four trials of civiliansby Court Martial wore concluded during the week, and convictions were obtained in thirty-five cases.,   The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed7 Sentences of Penal Sorvitudo (3 years to 7 years)020 n      u Imprisonment with (3 months to 2 yearshard labour).8 Hnes (10/- to  5)*The cases in which penal servitude was imposed includedthose of three Special Constables of Howry who were eachsentenced to terms of soven years for robbery with violenceA cadet of tho Auxiliary &quot;Division was sentenced to threemonthsx imprisonment with hard labour for theft of monoyand jewellery and a special constable of Tullymalogue,Co.

IMPORTANT JUDGMENT OF KING&apos;S BENCE DIVISION.

The Irish King&apos;s Bench Division gave an important judgment yesterday in an appeal from the finding of a Military Court in the case of seven prisoners who were convicted of levying war against the King and sentenced to death. It was urged on behalf of the appellants that the prerogative right of the King to proclaim Martial Law in Ireland had been virtually surrendered by the Royal consent to the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, and that Martial Law cannot now be proclaimed without the consent of Parliament. The competence of the Military Court to try the case was further challenged on the ground that the procedure applicable to a Court Martial under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act had not been complied with and that there was no state of war actually existing which justified the setting up of a Military Court not complying with these statutory requirements. The first contention was dismissed by the King&apos;s Bench as having no foundation in law. The second was held to depend upon the question whether estate of war does, in fact, exist in Ireland at the present time, and this question the Court after carefully reviewing the affidavits of the Commander-in-Chief and the Military Governor of the Martial Law Area, answered in the affirmative. The case was held to be indistinguishable from the recent case of John Allen in which the question as to the actual existence of a state of war was similarly decided, and following the precedent of that case the King&apos;s Bench dismissed the appeal on the ground that once a state of war justifying martial law was established to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court could not interfere to determine whether the action of the Commander-in-Chief in setting up a non-statutory Military
Court to try oases of rebellion was or was not justified as an act of military necessity. LORD DERBY13 VISIT TO IR-&amp;and.Lord Derby&apos;3 visit to Ireland has naturally excited such interest in Irish political circlos and there appears to bo a general disposition, especially in the Nationalist Prose to road into it a greater significance than tho circumstances warrant.     Although tho attitude of the two Loading Nationalist papers, tho Freeman&apos;s Journal and the Irish Independent is now more definitely Sinn Fein than it was a year ago, neither of them has at any time given its support to a policy of Republicanism, and in their anxioty to discover a foundation of truth in o^ory rumour of negotiation between the Government and the Sinn Fein leaders thoy undoubtedly reflect the hopes of the groat majority of the people of Southern Ireland to-day.(Intd)    H.G.Irish Office, S.W. 29th April, 1921.
