^TTfe^^gjent is the Property of His Britannic Majestys GovernmefltL * P.   2 88 3   iPrinted for the use of the Cabinet.  April 1921.SECRET.Deputation to the Right Hon. the Lord Chancellor,Friday, April 15, 1921.(In the Moses Room.  House of Lords.)Present:The Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Charnwood, Sir W. Ryland Adkins, K.C., M.P., Brigadier-General Cockerill, C.B., M.P., Captain Coote, D.S.O., M.P., J. L. Garvin, Captain Elliot, M.C., M.P., R, M. Barrington Ward (the &quot;Observer &quot;) and Mr. William Hard; the Lord Chancellor was accompanied by Sir John Anderson and Sir Claud Schuster.0V(Transcribed from the shorthand notes of W. B. Gurney and Sons, 26, Abingdon Street, Westminster, S.W. 1.)The Lord Chancellor^ I have received a number of questions from members who attended the deputatioiron the last occasion, and I am very glad that they have adopted the course of putting further questions. The range of them is very wide, and they seem to me to cover probably the whole debatable ground; and the putting of such questions has enabled me to obtain accurate information from the Irish Office where the matters sought to be explored are matters of fact as apart from matters of policy.One question is not answered in the list that I have before me. It is a wider question dealing with broad considerations of policy, which Lord Charnwood desired to raise, on the subject of fiscal policy. He desired to know (I am not quoting his question, but I am giving the substance of it) whether there was any real limit to the degree of fiscal freedom that might be conceded to Ireland, and, generally, what the views of the Government were upon the possible concessions which might be made under that head. I only received that question this morning, and, as the members of the deputation may be aware, I have been very busily engaged the whole day in other duties; and I do not care to answer a question of that importance upon the spur of the moment, because there are certain matters that have to be both accurately and delicately treated in answering it; but I will prepare at my leisure an answer to that, and I will forward it to Lord Charnwood, who possibly will make it known to the other members of the deputation.Lord Charnwood : Thank you very much; of course, we understand you could not possibly answer it at once.The Lord Chancellor : With that preface, I will address myself without delay to the questions that have been put to me by members of the deputation.Question 1 : Is it not both possible and desirable to bring the Irregular Forces of the Crown in Ireland under ordinary military command and discipline ?A answer : Only under Martial Law throughout the country could the Auxiliaries and Police come under military command.The term Irregular Forces is a misnomer, but it is presumably meant to refer to the Auxiliary Companies. Neither they nor the Police can come under military discipline unless enlisted as soldiers under the Army Act.At the same time, where Martial Law is declared, the Police and Auxiliaries work entirely under the Military Officer in Command, and the results in the Martial Law Area at present point to not only the greatest smoothness and co-operation in the work, but particularly satisfactory results in regard to discipline.[6111] &apos; . B
Question 2: Does not the execution of youths found guilty of what are not ordinarily capital offences, for example, having revolvers in their possession, tend to make popular heroes and martyrs, thus solidifying public opinion against the Government ?Answer: The Opposition press, for their own purposes, invariably depict any men who are executed as being in their first youth. As an instance, Joseph Murphy, who was convicted of murder by a bomb, and was described as a youth, was actually a man of 54 years of age. It must be remembered that in Ireland every man, whatever may be his age, is considered and is very frequently spoken of as a boy.The Opposition press have made a great point that executions, either for murder or for having arms in their possession, increases recruiting for the rebel forces, but, from information through intelligence sources, there is no doubt but that the policy at present in force has the effect of deterring many men from risking their lives, and that the rebel leaders find it increasingly difficult to get men to carry out their orders.Executions, whether for murder or for offences against Martial Law, may at the time intensify the feeling of bitterness against the Government on the part of those who are already disaffected, but there can be little doubt as to their deterrent effect; and, from the point of view of the ultimate settlement of the country, a firm and consistent policy is far more likely to be effectual than one of weakness and vacillation. It is believed that this is fully recognised by that section of public opinion which is most worthy of consideration.I may perhaps add, in supplement to that answer, that various steps which have been taken from time to time in the last five unhappy years in Ireland in the direction of lenity and mercy, have not been attended by the results which were hoped for. It will be remembered that at one period it was hoped that an act of special indulgence might produce good consequences, and those persons, many of whom were of desperate antecedents, who were detained in custody for complicity in the rebellion, were released; they were released as the result of agitation for many months amongst not only the Sinn Fein Party but the Nationalist Party. It is hardly an exaggera-tion to say that practically every well-known person who was so released has become a centre of Sinn Fein agitation in the years that have passed since, and in a very great number of cases those who were so released have actually become centres of the murder conspiracy.Then Question 3 : Have not burnings of property been from time to time inflicted upon neighbourhoods as a penalty for crimes that have taken place in them, and, if so, do not such acts of destruction, which must needs affect the innocent as well as the guilty, tend to exasperate the situation and set up a chronic state of crimes and punishments ?A answer: Burnings of property during the last six months have been confined almost entirely to official reprisals, which are carried out with the greatest care and after full investigation, and only in respect of persons who were participants in or had knowledge of an outrage. During that time there have been a few unofficial reprisals, the result of want of discipline on the part of those concerned, but the Irish Government are satisfied that any cases of this kind will in the future be few and far between. The military authorities consider that such reprisals, that is to say, official reprisals, do not tend to exasperate the situation, but, on the contrary, are tacitly welcomed by those persons who wish to live in peace and quiet. It must be remembered that from the highest to the lowest in Ireland there is at the present time not a shadow of moral courage, and therefore no body of persons, whether they call themselves Loyalists or Nationalists, will ever assert their opinions publicly.Question 4: Is there not danger, in the present state of insurrection, of such comparisons between the theory of civil war and that of the outbreak of crime, that the safeguards of either theory are broken down by an admixture of Martial and of Civil Law ?Answer : The meaning of this question is somewhat obscure. It is, of course, the case that many members of the I.R.A. are criminals as well as rebels, and they are treated accordingly. The theory of civil war cannot be applied simpliciter to persons who observe none of the laws and usages of war, persons who, in any war conducted against a civilised country, would undoubtedly be shot at the moment of capture on many grounds, for instance, the ground of not wearing a uniform and yet claiming and asserting the right to make attacks from ambush.
Question 5: Has not the time come when it would be wise on the part of His Majesty1?. Government to make an announcement showing how far they are prepared to go in meeting the national demand in Ireland, assuming always that the safety of the Loyalists, the integrity of the Empire and the safety of the British Isles would be maintained by any such plan ?A answer: As long ago as last August the Prime Minister said clearly that the Government&apos;s proposals for Ireland were embodied in the Government of Ireland Bill, since passed into law, but that he was prepared, if the majority of the Irish people wanted more, to see their accredited spokesmen and to consider any proposals they might put forward within the limits quoted in the question. This invitation, which has never been withdrawn, has never been accepted.The Governments solution is the Act. Sinn FehVs solution is a Republic. The Government have said quite definitely that as the price of peace they will give much more than their Act if Sinn Fein will on their part say what, short of an independent Republic, which Britain can never give, they are prepared to accept as a settlement, or if they will say that they are prepared to accept something short of a Republic as a basis for negotiation.As I stated a few weeks ago, when I was asked to receive the deputation, it is impossible, at the present moment, to resist the inference that nobody dare come forward and make such a proposal, even if there were any responsible body of persons who would be willing, if guaranteed physical immunity, to make it.Question 6: Would not such an announcement put Britain right in the eyes of the world ?Answer: A definite announcement of terms pledging the Government to the extreme limit of possible concession, if it could be made, would no doubt silence all who to-day express themselves sceptical regarding the Governments desire for settle-ment, but in the view of the Government, it is impossible to make such a statement except as the price of certain peace and settlement. While Sinn Fein continue to refuse to say that any such announcement would have this result, such announcement is impossible.This question raises a very important point of policy, on which opinions may differ. My own view, in a disputable matter, is that the Government is right. &apos; If at the present moment they were to undertake the extremely difficult task of announcing how far they would be prepared to go in the direction of compromise, the only result which appears in the least likely is that it would be met contemptuously by persons who would continue to repeat what, to do them justice, they have never varied from; they despise what is offered them and they have no intention of assenting to anything except an Irish Republic. That is the view on which we have proceeded, and I cannot think that anyone who has examined the evidence which is available to us would think that we have taken too gloomy a view.Question 7 : Is the widespread belief that the burning of Cork was the work of the Irregular Forces of the Crown justified ?A answer : It is not possible to add anything to the statement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 15th February last.The whole matter was very fully examined by the Prime Minister then, and such admissions as the Government felt that the facts required that they should make were then made, and it would not serve any useful purpose that I should repeat what he said then and what I have since stated in the debate in the House of Lords.Question 8 : It is reported to me that a Mr. 0&apos;Reilly of Cork, who had never associated himself with any lawless proceedings, was shot on his doorstep by the Forces of the Crown.  Is this true? And have not similar cases been frequent?Answer: An inquest was held on Mr. 0&apos;Reilly on the 10th February, which found that Mr. 0&apos;Reilly had been murdered by some person or persons unknown. There is no evidence whatever to connect the Forces of the Crown with this outrage, and on the body was found a paper which read : &quot;Spies beware. Penalty for all! I.R.A.&quot; The Convening Officer was not satisfied with the evidence of one of the witnesses, a woman, and made further enquiries, but without eliciting more information.The fact that Mr. 0&apos;Reilly is reported to be unassociated with any lawless proceedings has little weight. He was a Justice of the Peace, and it may be that the rebel, organisation had warned him to resign his appointment. It is only suggested that this may have been the reason of the murder. Similar cases have been frequent, inasmuch as a good many murders are committed in Ireland, the motive for which [6111] B 2
it is difficult in each specific case to establish, and in many cases where men have been shot as spies by civilians it has been proved that there was no foundation for the allegations whatever.The grotesque unfairness of drawing inferences that such murders have been committed by the Police in cases where no scintilla of quarrel between the Police and the person murdered can be established is too obvious to need elaboration.Question 9: The R.I.C. is now being recruited from Irishmen. What about Patria&apos;s letter to the &quot;Times &quot; ? Were the Auxiliaries not used without any propercode ?Answer; The statement that &quot;The R.I.C. is now being recruited from Irishmen&quot; is incorrect. The R.I.C. is now recruited both from Irishmen and Englishmen. Patria&apos;s letter to the &quot;Times&quot; gives a wrong impression. Since enrolment the Auxiliaries have always been subject to the R.I.C. code.Question 10 : Are Auxiliaries ordinary recruits to the R.I.C. ?Answer: No. The answer to the question 1(b) of the original questionnaire makes this clear. The so-called &quot; Black and Tans &quot; are the R.I.C. recruits, the Auxiliaries are not.Question 11: Do they get special pay for raids? A answer : No, they do not.Question 12 : Do they perform ordinary police duties?Answer : Yes, when circumstances permit and they are not on mobile work.Question 13: How long per day are they on duty ?Answer : Technically.twenty-four hours, like troops in the field on active service.Question 14 : Is there much drunkenness, and how is it dealt with? Answer : No.   When it occurs, dismissal follows.Question 15: Is every man aware of what his superior officers policy is, for example, conciliation of the population, repression of the rebels ?Answer: Yes. It is pointed out to all that the I.R.A. is their objective, and the civil population their friends.Question 16 : Are personal lectures on this subject delivered ? A answer: The Chief of Police has reiterated the policy mentioned in my last answer to every company himself.Question 17: Does not everything depend on the character of the Auxiliary officer ?Answer: Most certainly.Question 18 : Is method of selection careful enough ? Are they working to an organised and carefully enunciated plan ? Answer : Most certainly so.Question 19: (a.) Are the Government considering the question of concentra-tion and redistribution of their Forces upon any altered strategical plan, for example, the South African model ?(b.) How are allegations of outrage investigated ?(c.) Is Martial Law administered upon any uniform plan ?(d.) Is any special Court of Appeal against actions taken under Martial Law instituted or possible ?(e) How can crime be brought home to the Crown Forces ?Answer: (a.) If any such change were considered desirable, it would be the duty of the Commander-in-Chief to make representations on the subject to the Government.  He has not done so.(&amp;.) In the Martial Law area newspaper reports are carefully watched, and when they or other information point to an outrage the case is at once investigated by the nearest officer, and if there are sufficient grounds, an inquiry is held. Outside the Martial Law area the same procedure takes place. It is well to note that papers like the &quot; Freeman&apos;s Journal&quot; and the &quot;Independent&quot; make it a practice to publish news that is entirely false or so highly coloured as to distort out of recognition any facts there may be, and the work thus thrown on the authorities in endeavouring to investigate such matters is very great.(c.) Martial Law is administered on the same basis as was in force in South Africa, but adapted to local conditions.    As a matter of fact, on account of the
peculiar conditions existing in this country, the administration of Martial Law is but a shadow of what Martial Law is understood to mean, and intended to be, by military men.(d) Under Martial Law, as it has always been understood, there is no appeal, its justification being the Act of Indemnity that is passed when Martial Law is withdrawn. Experience of Irish administration, however, shows that persons who have a grievance, real of imaginary, have ample opportunity of bringing it to light.(e.) Any allegations against the Military, and in the Martial Law area, against the Police, for which there is sufficient evidence to bring the case to trial, are tried by a Field General Court Martial. Outside the Martial Law area all charges are submitted to searching investigation, and prosecution is directed wherever the facts warrant such a course.Question 20 : Does this mean that pacification must take years ?A answer : I am not sure that I appreciate the point. Warfare, irregular on the part of the Republicans, and on ours tempered by a desire not to put the screw on really tight, hitting alike innocent and guilty with equal severity, might take years. But pacification can be established (1) by settlement, or (2) by fighting, if fight we must, with every weapon, military and economic. If we must adopt the latter alternative owing to the refusal of Sinn Fein to negotiate a peace with us, then the the harder we hit the sooner will it be over.Question 21 : Does this mean that Sinn Fein leaders are losing control of their men IAnswer : We have no evidence or reason to believe that orders from their chiefs are not and would not be carried out by the officers and men of the I.R.A. If a degree of independence is given to some units it is probably due to communication difficulties.Question 22: Has not the Government assisted Sinn Fein by failing to make proper provision for ex-Service men ?Answer: Unemployment donation is available in Ireland, as in England, for ex-Service men, and apart from this 265,000/. was voted last year to provide employ-ment for ex-Service men in Ireland on works of public utility. A similar sum has been voted this year. In addition, the conditions attaching to the Emergency Unemployment Grant of 3,000.000/. administered by Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee have been specially modified as respects Ireland to, enable the needs of these men to be more adequately met.Question 23 : Do not the numbers under arms show that Sinn Fein must have many secret sources of supply ? Or arms in barrels seized during Dublin Easter raids ?Answer: Yes, it is believed so. The latter part of the question I am unfortunately quite unable to understand.Question 24 : Does this mean that if you make a truce with some part of Sinn Fein the others will repudiate it ?Answer : There is no reason to think that if &quot;a truce &quot; can be made with part of Sinn Fein, others will repudiate it. A truce implies a cessation of hostilities, and the actively hostile section are of course the extremists.Question 25: Has not the effect of breaking up Sinn Fein courts and administrations been to increase the powers of the extremists ?Answer: Certainly not. Sinn Fein courts were held by order of the Irish Republican Government, and were as much a part of their&apos;&quot; campaign &quot; as the activities of the Irish -Republican Army. It might be argued that it was the suppression of these courts that forced the rebel Government to depend more upon more violent methods of rebellion, but it was none the less a blow at the prestige of the central power.Question 26 : Does this mean that you are getting support from the population ?Answ,er: Generally speaking, it cannot be said that we are getting support from the population. We are undoubtedly getting more information than we were, and the large increase in Sinn Fein murders of those whom they think to be informers and label &quot; Convicted Spy &quot; shows that they are alive to the fact and uneasy about it.Question 27: Is it not contradictory to the facts to say there is a moderate element anywhere ? If not, is it not true that this element cannot affect the situation one way or the other ?
*   (JA answer : The second limb of this question is perhaps a little unhappily phrased, because it appears to have nothing to operate on.There is certainly a moderate element which can, and it is hoped will, make its voice heard in the councils of Sinn Fein with increasing force on the side of moderation and common sense, and thus afreet the situation most materially. It is impossible to believe that the whole number of those who carry weight with Sinn Fein are so unstatesmanlike, so unbusinesslike, and so unpatriotic as t) see no solution by settlement and no alternative to eternal killing for the sake of the name of Republic which we can never give them.Question 28 : Why go on with authorised reprisals if the effect is bad ? Why a large batch of them during Easter Week?Answer : That question was answered when I answered Question No. 3,Question 29 : Under whose authority are placards threatening police reprisals issued ?Answer : No such placards are issued under any authority.Question 30: Greater publicity promised. Discretion reserved. Does this mean Government will publish in cases of trial for life?Answer : Up to date all trials upon the capital charge have been in public, and representatives of the press have been present.Question 31 : It is expected that Ulster will be a working model. She will excite jealousy in the South if her Parliament succeeds.Does not this mean that it is more likely the South will attack than imitate her?Answer: The answer already given on the subject of the effect on the South of the setting up of a Parliament.in the North was prophecy. The answer tc such a question as this cannot be more than one of personal opinion.If the asker of this question, Captain Coote, contemplates that the effect will be to bring a Republican Army into the field against Ulster not at all a likely contingency that would certainly provide a new solution of the Irish question.Question 32: The Government still insist on the surrender of arms as a preliminary to a truce.Is this not insistence upon unconditional surrender ?Answer: No. A formal truce or armistice without surrender of arms is impossible, if only because it would, in our view, be almost certainly broken. Somebody might shoot at a policeman, the policeman might shoot back, and we, since our forces are in uniform and recognisable while theirs are not, would be charged with breaking faith.At the same time/there is nothing to prevent negotiations taking place without any question of surrender of arms. The opening of pourparlers would, in fact, almost certainly be followed immediately by an automatic informal truce, in which equally there would be no question of surrender of arms.Question 33 : What exactly does the Prime Minister mean by his reservations ? Answer : This question is not understood   The Prime Minister has been quite specific on several occasions.Question 34: Would it not lessen Sinn Fein distrust if he put on paper what he will offer ?Answer : That I think I have sufficiently dealt with in my answer to Question No. 6.Question 35: Who are the prescribed members of Dail Eireann? Will the Government publish the names ? If Dail Eireann meet, whom will the Government send to speak to them? What is the authority of Dail Eireann over the Irish people ?   Could they take less even if they wanted to ?   *Answer&quot;. The Government will publish names as soon as there is any response to their offer of negotiation. It would be unwise to do so in advance, as conditions may change radically, but the Prime Minister has made it quite clear that in present circumstances the number would not exceed three or four.That, gentlemen, covers all the questions which have been addressed to me in the interval between our last meeting and the present.Captain Coote : May I explain, by way of excuse for the incomprehensible form of some of those questions, that I did not understand that they were to be submitted to you as questions ?
The Lord Chancellor : I understand. There are only two that presented any difficulty.Captain Coote : I am afraid it was made out in the form of notes for my own use more than anything else.The Lord Chancellor : I follow, perfectly, There are only two which presented any difficulty.Lord Charnwood: Captain Coote relied on my editing them, to some extent, but I gave up the task.The Lord Chancellor : You are very persevering: but it is very easy to under-stand, if one makes notes for one&apos;s own use for a speech, there may be a difficulty in apprehending the precise point.The Archbishop of Canterbury : I should like to say something, if I may. I was very much struck, in trying to get one&apos;s thoughts clear on this extraordinarily difficult subject, by what the Lord Chancellor said on the former occasion. What he said with regard to negotiation and the lack of any one authority, seemed to me to be unanswerable. I was very much struck by his testimony to the increase or the restoration of moral amongst the Constabulary by what had recently been happen-ing. He also spoke to us upon the recklessness of the misrepresentations and the propaganda of lies which is going on with regard to alleged outrages by men in uniform. Every one of us who has tided in any way to look into the facts must have found himself pulled up by that very fact the fact that things break down. I have had case after case where I have tried to look into it and it has broken down, and it has evidently shown that the facts were either not existing or were grossly exaggerated. But when all allowance is made for that. 1 still feel that the impression left upon my mind, when I have read this report of what the Lord Chancellor said last time and remember what he had spoken, was very different to the effect on my mind of the ordinary conversation which one has with people who come back from Ireland, who are not sympathisers with Sinn Fein and who may be even heartily the other way, but who talk about the sight of lorries full of young men in high spirits up and down the country, and that kind of thing, which they have seen with their own eyes.The Lord Chancellor said on the last occasion that any fair-minded person who would make an examination, however meticulous, of what has taken place in the period since the Auxiliary Forces have been in existence, would realise how wide and how cruel the invention and exaggeration has been. That I believe to be absolutely true, but it is an extraordinarily difficult thing, apparently, to make an examination and to get the facts. I have had three instances in the last fortnight of people who have said that they have seen men who have been injured and whose stories thev wished to tell. These people have said:&quot;For God&apos;s sake, don&apos;t name me; my life would not be worth three or four hours if I was known to have given any information derogatory to the Military Forces.&quot;Now the stories that I have referred to are not gossip, but are narratives of people actually telling what they have seen; and the information is not given by the injured or the wronged or the alleged injured or wronged, because they have a fear of what reprisals would mean to them.The other day, after we were here on the last occasion, I read in the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; an account &quot;From our own Correspondent&quot; of what is described as military reprisals. This is from the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; of the 8th April. It says: &quot;Reprisals for the shooting of Constable Stanley Moore at Miltown Malbay on the 23rd March, took place on Wednesday. Lorries of military and police arrived in the town about 10 o&apos;clock, when, following a round-up of all the males of the town, the house of Michael Hayes was bombed and totally destroyed. The bomb explosion shattered the windows of several houses.&quot; All of that would seem to me to be perfectly compatible with what we have been told that that is a mode of military punishment. Then it goes on: &quot;After this destruction a party of Crown Forces went to John Sullivan&apos;s drapery establishment, from which they removed goods and placed them on the roadway and made a bonfire of them. After-wards they bombed houses, which were completely destroyed.&quot;I thereupon wrote to the Editor of the &quot;Westminster Gazette,&quot; and asked : &quot; Is your correspondent in Cork a person upon whose testimony you place reliance?&quot;; because one knows what correspondents may report in a general way. He answered that he had never found hi$ correspondent in Cork to mislead him, but he would
telegraph out and enquire. He then sends me the answer which he got, A telegram had been sent to ask if there was any particle of doubt about the truth, and the telegram in reply is as follows: &quot; No doubt. Basil Blake, Press Agent, Dublin Castle, issued statement Saturday that bombing was carried out as military operation following murder of Constable Moore 31st March.&quot;Now that is a comparatively small matter, in one respect, because it is the burning of drapery stores; but it is extraordinarily difficult to fit in with official accounts which we have of the grave doings under military authority of reprisals which are meant to terrify the neighbourhood by such things as bombing houses. Taking things out and burning them in the roadway would seem to be a thing likely to be done by high-minded and high-spirited young men, but seems strangely unlike what would ordinarily be described as a military reprisal. That is the kind of thing I mean. It is a different matter altogether when the accounts come to us from people who tell us of things which they profess to have seen or to have heard at first hand.There was an extraordinary story current a few weeks ago about some men who were making confession in a place near Cork, and a young officer came in and said to the priest: &quot; These men must speak up so that t can hear all they say. You cannot have men talking privately like this.&quot; The priest answered: &quot;You must have exceeded your instructions; go and ask your chief and I think you will find that kind of tiling is not what is intended.&quot; He did go to the military chief and came back and said that he had his authority and he must insist upon the execution of the order. The priest thereupon ceased to hear confession and the men were dispersed. When 1 was told of this, I wrote to the Roman Catholic Bishop of the Diocese and asked him what the facts were. He said the facts were as stated and that he had received a perfectly courteous admission of them by the General in command of the district and that he regretted what took place. It is a kind of thing which is explicable, but it seems to me that it needs a good deal of explanation, because there must be some authority behind the man who is doing that kind of thing.A further story was current, which I mention because it was connected with that, that there were dictaphones being placed in confessional boxes. I thought it was past all possible belief and I asked the Bishop: &quot;Have you heard anything about that?&quot; because it was not only stated in Ireland, but it was published in France. That is one of the stories like those which the Lord Chancellor has referred to, which I should imagine was without foundation. The Bishop answered that he had not heard of it, and he did not believe it to be true. Then the Bishop goes on to say: &quot;No one living out of Ireland can realise the cruelty with which our people are treated day after day by certain practices of the uniformed servants of the Crown The vast body of our people are resigning themselves to this treatment with marvellous fortitude.&quot; He sent me the correspondence that passed with regard to the other story, which showed that what was said did not exactly correspond with the facts.Now, those are merely examples of the kind of thing which, in grossly exaggerated forms, one is hearing day after day, but they do present a different kind of picture as regards the exercise and successful carrying out of discipline on the part of the Authorities, from what the Government explanations would generally lead one to understand.Then comes an exceedingly grave and difficult matter; I do not know whether I ought to speak of it at all, but one does hear it said: &quot; What do you expect when you know that some of the men who are in high authority are men whose conduct in the past prove them to be people who should not be trusted with these matters?&quot; I do not refer to people at the top, like General Macready or General Strickland; but that is the kind of difficulty which you will be faced with, with regard to men whose names do not carry in army circles or in civilian circles the kind of authority which one would like to be borne.by the people on whom responsibility is placed.Those are the kind of things that occur to me. I quite understand that the Lord Chancellor will say it is quite impossible to answer such I will not say . vague-1 statements, but that kind of statement. I only wanted to say that I had hoped, and still hope, to get something that will reassure all those who wish to say honestly that they feel justified in the main that in the way that the Government are carrying on they are on sound ground, and that we need have no hesitation on that point. The &apos; kind of answers which the Lord Chancellor has given, produce a kind of picture that is quite different from the impression that I % received from people who come from Ireland and who have spoken to me.I do not know if I have put the matter unfairly.
The Lord Chancellor: Oh, no; on the contrary, I think the Primate has rendered a service by the clearness with which he has expressed his view. It is quite true, as he himself is the first to recognise, that he has put forward his view with considerable generality of statement; and indeed, for reasons which are obvious, it is very difficult, if one is approaching this question critically, to avoid that. He did in two cases make more specific statements, and with regard to those two cases, I can only say, what will be apparent to everybody, that if on enquiry they prove to be well-founded, undoubtedly occasion would exist for severe censure and possibly for punishment. In one of the cases it appeared to be admitted that the offence was committed, if I understand the Primate aright.The Archbishop of Canterbury : Do you mean the confession case? The Lord Chancellor ; No, the reprisal case.Sir John Anderson ; I enquired personally into that case when I saw the newspaper reports. To the best of my belief what took place there was that a military reprisal was ordered by the responsible military officer; and no one below the rank of Colonel-Commanding is authorised by General Macieady to conduct a reprisal. I cannot help thinking that the description of the destruction of the contents of the drapers shop conveyed a slightly misleading impression. Miltown Malbay is not by any means a large place, and a drapers shop in Miltown Malbay is not to be compared with Harrod&apos;s or Peter RobinsonV, I should imagine it was the meanest sort of general store; and very likely, I may assume, the military authorities concerned were entirely justified in associating the proprietor of that establishment with the outrage which had just taken place. The purpose of destroying the goods and not destroying the shop itself may have been that according to his information the goods were the property of the offender and the premises were not. I know that in certain other cases furniture has been destroyed on those grounds. I state that simply by way of explanation. The policy of official reprisals, I believe, is recognised by all authorities as legitimate in the administration of Martial Law. Anyhow, that is a matter within the discretion of the Military Governor. But so.far as it is relevant to the question of discipline, I think I may say confidently that this was not a case in which any breach of discipline can be charged against the Forces of the Crown. The action of the Military Governor in giving orders which were carried out in that way may be open to question I do not know but to the best of my belief, whatever was done there on that occasion was done with full authority.. The Lord Chancellor : The Primate himself was good enough to say that his correspondent in Ireland denied the charge which had been made, which certainly seemed to be extravagant in relation to the dictaphone in the confessional. Of course it was absurd; but that is the kind of absurd statement which those of us who have to read press cuttings on these matters over and over again see.When the Archbishop adds that he meets people who come over from Ireland, who are by no means either well-disposed to the Sinn Feiners or ill-disposed to the Government of this country, and they had given an impression of the whole situation which is not altogether the impression which is conveyed by the observations I made a few weeks ago, I think the explanation is not really a very difficult one. After all, I prepared these answers and have made my observations with a definite object which I think will be clear to anybody who listened to them or read them carefully, and what he said showed that the Primate most clearly appreciated it. I made those explanations as a member of the Government, without making them by any means as a member of a Government which came before you triumphantly in order to announce a task which was achieved, but as one who came before you to call attention to the extraordinary difficulties of the task to which we are committed, and to the grotesque unfairness with which it appeared to us in many responsible quarters we were being assailed. In the course of the exposition which I attempted then, I did no doubt deal with a number of specific charges, but my purpose was an altogether different one from that of a gentleman who ordinarily resides in Ireland, and no doubt has been residing there recently under circumstances of great and growing inconvenience and anxiety, and who is asked by an Englishman living in security to give an account of things in Ireland. But I should certainly have been very much surprised if the narrative so elicited had been marked by any exuberant gaiety. It is, of course, obvious that it is an extremely disagreeable country to live in. at the present moment, that much that we most dearly prize is for the moment completely gone, and that there is little safety and little liberty, as we construe safety and [6111] C
liberty under the conditions of Western civilisation to-day. It is very intelligible that the accounts of those who come over from Ireland under those conditions are couched very frequently in terms unsympathetic towards the Government. .0f course, the view of those who live there is that things could not very well be much worse, that Government is responsible, and that if they cannot do anything else, as far as the Government is concerned, they can at least criticise it; and I, for one, should be the last person in the world to blame them for any scanty solace which is to be gained by a process in which so many can participate. But as far as we are concerned, as I have said, our position is not, and has not for a long time been, one of elation. We believe that we are confronted with a task of extraordinary difficulty, we believe that we are making very gradual, often almost imperceptible, but some progress in the right direction; we do not put it higher than that; and I never purported in the whole of the lengthy oration that I inflicted upon you on the last occasion, to claim other than that we have still unhappy experiences, and that there will be further unhappy experiences.I do not know whether any other member of the deputation wishes to make any observations.Mr. Elliot : There is one single point on the question as to this extra-ordinarily indiscreet order that the confession should be made aloud, which has apparently been admitted which was not dealt with.The Lord Chancellor: Was that admitted?Sir John Anderson : Might I perhaps just put one question ? The Archbishop mentioned this case to me privately after the last meeting. I should very much like to know what were the circumstances in which it was possible for an officer to approach a number of people who were making confession and give directions that they should speak aloud, with the result that they dispersed. What occurred to me, when I heard of the case, was that something had happended such as happened within my own experience quite recently at Mountjoy Prison, where a priest visited certain prisoners in that prison in the ordinary capacity of a visitor. He then proceeded to hear confession and was interrupted by the officer or warder, who, according to prison rules, was present, and whose duty it is to be present during visits, and he was told that he could not hear confession in those circumstances, the rule being that the prisoner in custody must select and nominate the priest to whom he will make confession, and he is entitled to make confession to that priest and to that priest only. It did occur to me, in this particular case, and I am inclined to think, notwithstanding what the Archbishop has said, that the misunderstanding must have been due to some such circumstances.The Lord Chancellor : You have not been able to enquire ?Sir John Anderson : I have not got the particulars to enable me to verify the facts from the official side, but in the ordinary way people make confession in church, and military officers do not invade churches.The Lord Chancellor : I forget whether any details were given of the locality; were they?The Archbishop of Canterbury : Yes, it was in barracks.The Lord Chancellor : It did not identify the barracks, did it ?The Archbishop of Canterbury : I can give you the letter to make it perfectly clear. The Bishop was satisfied, I will not say by the apologia, but by the explanation.Sir John Anderson : What I. mean is that the expression of regret was not necessarily an admission of any impropriety on the part of those concerned, but rather a consideration as regards the courtesy on the part of the officer concerned, and that the young officer acted properly in accordance with his instructions.The Lord Chancellor : At any rate, it would be premature to condemn him without knowing all-the facts.The Archbishop of Canterbury : My point was that if it is said that it was undoubtedly right, that meets it; but it strikes one as the type of thing which would give the impression of a subordinate officer feeling himself free to act in that way.
Sir John Anderson : All officers in charge of the temporary barracks and prisons have the most explicit orders in regard to confession.General Cockerill ; I should like to put this rather in the form of a question. You, sir, mentioned that a firm and consistent policy is more likely to be effectual than one of weakness and vacillation. My information is that there are a number of people who are found in possession of arms who are not executed, although the Government did make a statement that all persons found in possession of arms would be executed.The Lord Chancellor : Are liable to be ; they never said that all persons found in possession of arms would be executed.General Cockerill ; Then it is a liability to execution. Then you mentioned something about the theory of civil war in answer to a question. Would the Govern-ment be prepared to offer belligerent rights to rebels, to make a broad distinction between those who fight fair and those who fight from behind the walls ? Would they be prepared to offer them belligerent rights if the rebels for their part would obey the laws of war and, particularly, would carry their arms openly and wear distinguishing uniform in accordance with The Hague Convention? Such an offer would put the rebels in a very difficult position, at any rate, because if they obeyed the laws of war they could certainly be dealt with very much more easily, and if they did not obey the laws of war they could at least be punished with  the full approval of the civilised world.The Lord Chancellor : The suggestion that one should make an offer does not appear to me to afford particularly good prospects of effecting any improvement. If the Irish nation, or a majority of the Irish nation, wish, instead of their present treacherous and murderous campaign, to undertake an open rebellion against the forces of the Crown, they are perfectly well able to do it, and they know they are perfectly well able to do it. without any invitation from the Crown. All they have to do is what any other insurgent population has done, what the Southern States of America did. Persons who want to do that are perfectly familiar with the way they can do it. They can get into uniform, and they can simply rebel and marshal themselves with organised troops. But I think the spectacle of a country whose subjects are suffering from murder and ambushes, publishing an announcement of that kind, and saying : &quot; If you put yourselves into uniform and carry arms openly and generally clothe yourselves with a combatant character, we will treat you as if you were not rebels but belligerents,&quot; would, I think, be unusual, and I confess myself I do not think it would be a very hopeful proceeding.General Cockerill : I do not wish to argue the point; the position is quite clear from the words you have used. What was in my mind was definitely to make a distinction between acts of murder and perfectly legitimate acts of warfare, not only which every soldier recognises as legitimate, but which you just now in replying coupled together with murder and ambushes. But murder is murder, and ambush is legitimate wrarfare.The Lord Chancellor : But ambush without uniform is, in our view, murder, and that is the view of every competent writer on military affairs, and it is so laid down in every manual of every civilised country. When it is committed by a man not wearing uniform it is simply murder. It is as if I, going away from this House, were shot by a man who was not wearing uniform.General Cockerill : Another point I wanted to make clear as to the policy of the Government was this. You said that Martial Law was being administered &apos; practically on the same lines in Ireland as it was in South Africa. I was myself responsible for the administration of Martial Law in South Africa, in Cape Colony, and I confess that to me there seemed to be some very broad distinctions. We issued extremely careful instructions to all officers administering Martial law which were public property. Similar instructions, judging from replies I have received to questions I have asked in the Llouse, were not issued here. W7e made no arrest on suspicion in South Africa, whereas,large numbers of arrests on suspicion have been made in Ireland. We tried reprisals; we tried them for a week and then gave them up. We regarded what is called authorised reprisals as being quite futile; and I should like to ask in that connection whether these official reprisals are only ordered as a definite sentence after due trial, or whether they are what might be described [6111] D
as authorised terrorism, the object being to terrorise the population by an act which might induce them not to repeat similar conduct.The Lord Chancellor : There does not seem to me to be a very strict difference between a reprisal ordered as a result of a trial and a reprisal which consists of pure terrorism. Its object as an act to create a. feeling of terror does not in the least depend upon whether it results from the sentence of a court or not. General Cockerill will allow me to lay stress upon the first part of the question rather than, if I. may say so, to confuse it by an alternative which does not exist: whether in all cases formal trials precede an order for reprisals. I confess I should find it difficult to answer that without notice. It would surprise me if in all cases it was found possible to have anything in the nature of an ordinary trial; because the very nature of the emergency which explains and justifies anything in the nature of a reprisal would in ordinary cases, I should imagine, be impossible to consider in the form of an ordinary trial. I do not suppose that reprisals are preceded by ordinary trials. All one can say is that one supposes and hopes and believes that proper enquiries are made by responsible persons before what are known as official reprisals are permitted. But I must make it quite plain that the Government, except in so far as the Government generally is responsible, does not, of course, hold itself responsible, and cannot hold itself responsible for the exercise of discretion in every matter of detail by military officers who are engaged in countries where Martial Law exists. Of course, there is a sense in which the Government is broadly responsible, and by which it will stand or fall when it comes to Parliament and asks for indemnity; but I believe it was with the approval of the majority of the nation and most of our critics that Martial Law should be established in Ireland. The very admission of the necessity of Martial Law, which precedes the application of Martial Law to a particular area, involves the conclusion that the Government must let go of its control in a great number of areas and must commit the control of those areas to the very experienced military authorities to whom authority in these matters has been conceded. As to whether there is a regular control or not, I should think it is extremely unlikely.As to the question of the distinction between the operation of Martial Law in South Africa and in Ireland as applied by the Irish Office, we share the view that in all fundamental points there is identity of method in both cases. Of course, Ireland is one country and South Africa is another; the relative frequency of towns to rural areas, the disposition of the people, the state of campaign, all these introduce differentiating elements which make it idle to expect a complete parallel. But I myself believe it is well-founded that generally the methods do correspond.Captain Coote : May I ask one supplementary question about that ? You said last time that the houses that were destroyed by authorised reprisals usually turned out to be the property of respectable absentee landlords. If that is so, I quite admit that the Government cannot control the discretion of particular commanders on the spot in regard to those reprisals, but surely they can control the policy of whether there should be reprisals or not.The Lord Chancellor : The attention of those responsible has been very pointedly called to one or two cases in which it was considered that an unfortunate exercise of discretion had been made. For instance, the loyalty of Lord Midleton is unimpeachable, but, on a recent occasion, in the town of Midleton, which bears his name and on which he is largely dependent for his livelihood, four houses were completely destroyed- as a deterrent to the local population, who had no pecuniary or other interest in them. As I said, the attention of those who are responsible was very pointedly called to this. Errors no doubt may be made, but, examining the whole of this situation in perspective and observing what has been done and what has been omitted, it is the opinion of those responsible that very much more good than harm has been done by these reprisals when regulated, and that it is impossible to mitigate the harm, which there is, of course, to some extent, without in any way forfeiting what is useful and deterrent.Sir Ryland Adkins : I am sorry I could not avoid being late, and I did not, therefore, hear some of your answers to some of the earlier questions. Are you able to express any opinion, or are you free to express any opinion, as to whether it is desirable and possible to absorb the Black and Tans and the Cadets into other forces&quot;? It appears to me, as far as I can ascertain, that a great deal of the kind of criticism to which his Grace has referred criticism and comment on the part of persons in Ireland who are perfectly well disposed to the Government and to law and
order is largely concentrated on the acts of the Cadets and on the acts of the Black and Tans The other day I had an opportunity of discussing with two persons, who, I should not say were as well disposed to Ireland as we are, but who were very interested people, one was a mayor of a town in Ireland, a Nationalist, not a rebel, he has done no act of violence, and the other was a Roman Catholic priest; and the very fact that they had no complaint whatever to make against the regular forces of the&apos; Crown and practically no complaint to make against the R.I.C. made one interested to know how far the individuals who are Cadets and the individuals who are Black and Tans could be absorbed into the regular forces and the R.I.C. respectively in such a way as not to be the target for criticism which may sometimes be quite accurate, and very often is quite accurate. The stories that these people tell me about how these young fellows were tearing about on motor-cars and singing songs, which certainly very much disturbed the Catholic population, and generally behaving in a way which one recognised as being undisciplined (I assume for a moment that what I was told was true) made it seem to me unfortunate that that sort of thing should go on; and the sharp distinction they drew between the regular forces and the R.I.C. led one to wonder whether it was not possible so to arrange the forces of order in Ireland that they should have the reputation and authority among people which the regular army and the R.I.C. apparently have.The Lord Chancellor : All the information which I have been able to examine has led me to the conclusion that it is a very subtle part of the propaganda of what I call the murder section of the population to select the Black and Tans for their special abuse. I do not think it is in the least that they like the soldiers any better, but there is not any doubt at all that the Black and Tans have been by far the most formidable of the opponents of the murder gang. I am excluding altogether for the moment the question as to whether there have been irregularities and instances of indiscipline and instances of outrage on the part of the Black and Tans. For the purpose of this argument I put on one side those cases and I ignore them and take the rest of the forces against which no such charges can be substantiated, and, indeed, against whom no such charge has been brought. I say it is the most formidable force in Ireland to-day. When you take the soldiers, when the majority of them went there, they were taken away before they had completed their Aldershot training. They were taken away against the strong protests of many of their commanding officers, because they said they were untrained boys. I heard a most distinguished general, who was in high military command, who was giving his opinion about this; he said they were so young and inexperienced that they were really not fit to go, and that, though they will make and are gradually making fine men, there simply can be no comparison at all on the basis of combatant efficiency between them and the hardened soldiers who constitute the Black and Tans. The Black and Tans have been, and are, a most formidable and even a terrible force; and, putting on one side all the outrages, that is generally acknowledged by everyone. Under those circumstances, the murder people know perfectly well that the Police in Ireland were a doomed force until the Black and Tans intervened. They knew their moral had been destroyed. They were able to hold courts all over the country, and every kind of law and order ceased, and it was the Black and Tans, and the Black and Tans alone, who have cured that; and that, in my judgment, is the reason why they are the principal targets of abuse. It does not follow that it might not be worth the experiment, if it was a practicable one, to retain all the combatant qualities of the Black and Tans while attempting to mask their identity by merging them in one of the other forces. One would have to dismiss at once any suggestion of merging them in the military forces. The conditions of enlistment and everything else would make that impossible. I do not really profess to know how far they might be merged in one of the other Police forces so that their identity would gradually disappear. But, strange as it may appear, they are by no means anxious that their identity should disappear. They are very proud of it. They have a great esprit de corps, and I believe, in the overwhelming majority of cases, it is one of.the most deserving forces and one with the most conspicuous gallantry that I have ever known.Sir Ryland Adkins : Will you say a word about the Corps of Cadets ?The Lord Chancellor : I am really not sufficiently informed about that.Sir John Anderson : I think there is a great confusion with regard to the term &quot; Black and Tan.&quot; The term Black and Tan was originally applied to new recruits for the R.I.C. before there were any Cadets. Those Cadets, within a couple of months, were entirely absorbed into the regular R.I.C., and the term was then
transferred to the Auxiliaries. The ordinary person, I believe, who talks of Black and Tans to-day means Auxiliaries. The term was originally applied to the young new recruits for the R.I.C., for whom there was not a supply of the ordinary green R.I.C. uniform.The Lord Chancellor : Will you tell us, would there be any possibility at all of the whole body of Police being amalgamated ?Sir John Anderson : There would be no possibility at all of incorporating the Cadets with the R.I.C. It would destroy their character completely, and I do not suppose they would be prepared to accept the ordinary terms of the R.I.C. They receive better pay and they are men of a different type of experience.The Lord Chancellor : I think, gentlemen, that those are the principal points.Sir Ryland Adkins : We should like to thank you very much.The Lord Chancellor : It has been a great pleasure to me. I cannot pretend, as I have said, to give satisfactory answers to all the questions, but I can at least try to give all the information that one can.
