The miners agreed to meet the owners at tho invitation of the Prime Minister, but it is to be feared that their unoojigremising attitude in regard to pumping will prevent any sottioment at present.The extremists who control Ecoleston Square, and who are largely responsible for theminers&apos;strike, are very greatlyperturbed by the application of tho Emergency Powers Act.   They were relieved at the turn events took yesterday as they anticipated disaster,in view of the Government preparations, had the strike extended in accordance with their original desire.The case tot   the owners has been very badly presented in the Press, and there is much misunderstanding.On Tuesday ni^ht black slips bearing, in white lettering, the words &quot;DEAD MSN TELL NO TALES&quot; were placed in the hats of moderate trade union leaders and have aroused much anxiety on the part of , the recipients.There has been disorder in Scotland and South Wales at extremist centres and rioting will doubtless increase.   Sinn Feiners are prominent in the rioting in Lanarkshire.A Nottinghamshire miner has suggested that it would be good policy for the owners to pay the wages and district rates to the Miners&apos; Federation in a lump sum and let the Federation distribute the money on a national basis.As might have been expected, the Communists have boon steadilygaining groiind as a consequence of the strike and unemployment,, Some in to touting extracts are given from ler.te.rs wl.K .-c. Ia -7v?o British Extremists, now in Moscow.   They show that on March IVththere/
there was a meeting at which it was decided to give  50,000 to finance the Communist movement in Western countries; Snglai was apparently to have its share.   This, of course, is a grosi breast   of the Trading Agreement.Incendiary fires, shooting at polioe and a murder in London have taken place during the past fortnight, all the work of Sinn 1&apos;sin and its representatives in England, the Irish Self-Determination League.   Fintan Murphy, an important leader in London, has been deported to Ireland.The situation in Ireland is no batter.   While de Valera is ready to meet Sir James Craig, Collins declared to an American journalist lest wee): that his party would not allow meeting and that they wore now certain of winning if they continued their present policy.
THE COAL MINERSOn April 1st work ceased in all the coalfields in Great Britain, and within a day or so the great majority of pump and engine men were withdrawn.   Subsequent        -developments have been fully reported in the Press.Yesterday the executives of the railwaymen, miners and transport workers met separately and afterwards held a joint conference.   The miners and owners later agreed to accept the Prime Ministers invitation to meet, but the former have refused to comply with the   owners1 - demand that pumping should first be resumed.The rai+ioayinen and transport workers&apos; executives met again this morning and the Triple Alliance will meet at Unity House this evening.&apos; The present position is one of deadlock and the extremist &quot;counsels are strengthened by an announcement that the Executive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engitiemen and Firemen has declared that its members will be ordered not to handle traffic to the collieries or carry troops or &quot;blacklegs&quot;.The miners are solid, but the steadier men in most districts regard with&apos; dismay the destruction of their means of livelihood.   In spite of the efforts of volunteers, water is gaining&quot;in many pits and the situation is complicated by intimidation.Disorder has occurred in those districts of Scotland and South Wales v/here there are extremist centres and it is probable that rioting will increase as the &quot;feeling of the men grows more bitter.   Sinn Peiners have been prominent &apos; in the rioting in Lunarkshire..There is considerable discrepancy between the statements of the owners and the miners regarding
the terms offered and the complicated nature of the figures renders juggling easy.   Feeling in regard to the stoppage   9 is governed largely by the rates offered:   in Leicestershire for instance, where they constituted an increase, there is little enthusiasm, and other Midland areas would only suffer slight reductions.A Nottinghamshire minor has suggested that a solution of the dispute might ho for the owners to pay wages, at district rates, to the Miners&apos; Federation in a lump sum. The Federation could then pay on a national basis and the miners1 willingness to sacrifice individual benefit for common good would then bo tested.There   has been abnormally close contact between JSccleston Square, George Lang bury and the Triple Allianco delegates:   last wook Lansbury personally picketed the miners,   Eocloston Square is attempting to function as a sort of General Staff and has converted a great number of labour leaders to the belief that the present is the moment for a united stand against the capitalist system.   Under the camouflage of resistance to wage reduction, class war has been extensively preached and with some success, owing to the fact that the workers will always respond when they believe their wages to be at stake.The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is particularly mischievous and must bear much of the responsibility for the aotion of the Triple Alliance,   Deliberate incitement has been evident in several articles during the crisis and the paper is a distinct danger to social peace.Owing to the Sheffield conference, revolutionaries were concentrated in one town last week, but the men have now dispersed to their various contres and the communists are sending speakers to the coalfields.According to statements made at the Manchester Quarterly Meeting of the Co-operative Wholesale-Society onAnril/
a * 39&quot;; *: w * . -April 2nd, trade union funds invested in the Co-operative Wholesale Society1a Bank amount to just over  2,000,000 and can be easily realised.   Of this sum, about   50,000 belong to the miners.   As the local societies are practically, autonomous, the assistance rendered to the strikers will vary according to the district.   The London Co-operative Society for instance is in close touch with Labour extremists and will probably place its resources at their disposal.On M:.\rch 25th the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform*Committee held a conference in the Labour Church at Mexborough;   probable reporters, including the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;were refused admission, but my correspondent was able to obtain a verbatim&apos;report.   I&apos;ae chairman stated that &quot;the movement-must bo revolutionary..*wo may be called upon very soon to play a very serious part.   Vie are out for the complete capture of the Miners&apos; Federation.   South Wales is adopting our view and all existing officials are to be swept away in the revolutionary movement.   A determined effort is to bo made to oapture the Miners&apos; Ihii on by June, ,,A letter was then read from A.J. Cook, agent for &quot;Khondda No. 1 and a leader of the Reform movement.   He expressed the hope that a lock-out would take place on .Hf,,rch 31st as it would make the men rebels and further their cans o.l&apos;he full programme of the unofficial movement whichaims at the overthrow of the existing system was theni,adopted, as wao a resolution to join the $bird International.3J3ie. policy of the National Mine Workers Industrial Union,, which is to bo the new name of the unofficial movement, v/as then discussed and it was agreed:(a)/ &apos;
(a) That the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Unofficial Befarm MovomJ is an organisation constituted to work inside the Yorkshire Miner&quot;i&apos; Association to reform rules and objeots.        ..  .(b) To join other countries to unite rebel forces in minors Association in Groat Britain.(c) To link up unofficial movement with other industries and shop 3towards.(d) To make use of propaganda, revolutionary literature and to run unofficial candidates for official positions in lodges.(e) To establish an information bureau.(!&apos;)   ffo propagate idea of communal ownership of mines for workers.(&amp;)   To use Co-operative Banh,(h) To run educational classes in conjunction with Labour Colleges.(i) To strengthen tho International Miners Federation.(j)   That Political Action be taken owing to tho utter futility of present&apos; parliamentary institutions.(k)   That International boundaries for industries be &apos;   abolished.Some delegates asked for an explanation of &quot;political action&quot; and the chairman told them that this was &quot;to secure control of education and police and proceed with the formation of Red Guards.&quot;Resolutions were passed advocating &quot;mass action as the only means of throwing over the capitalist state and establishing an industrial republic,&quot; declaring that      * &quot;unemployment cannot be cured by legislation.but only when the workers combine and take over the control of industry.&quot;45 delegates were present and a propaganda committee of 5 was appointed.   The Yorkshire coalfield is to be flooded with revolutionary literature before next June.It must he admitted that the Press has been very badly informed throughout the crisis.   For.this the Mine Owners1 Association must take the blame, though they retort that they invited the Press to send representatives to examine
the figures, which are very complicated, and offered to explain them in the form of a lecture.   The Press, however, sent a few inferior reporters who failed to grasp what was said, with the result that the owners1 case has never properly been presented.The labour Research Bureau in Eccleston Sonare is said to bo exerting an influence on the Press by means of the National Union of Journalists.THE BED Ij^BRgmOM Off TRADE UHIOMSThe official delegates of the British Bureau of this movement and of the shop stewards, J.T. Murphy and N* Watkins, a miner,tare at present in Moscow.   The latter has sent reports of meetings of the International Executive, held at Moscow onFebruary  8th and March 19th.   The first states:&quot;That the Bureau itself should control its affairs and direct its methods of working in the Trade Union movement.   The Communist Party was desirous of governing , and directing the work of the Bed Trade Union International.,,&quot;It was put to the meeting whether they would sit and hear my report at that meeting or adjourn the meeting for another date.   I insisted at least upon giving the most important part of my report dealing with the financial situation of the movement and its latest development; this was finally agreed to, and the necessary arrangements were made regarding the supply of same...&quot;I am predicting a great conflict in the mining industry in the near future in April or May...Press forwaid withcut fear, your cause must win.   Right is ours, let there be no indication of weakness on your part.   Ho fluctuation or wavering but a constant going forward to victory5 marching militantly over every obstacle that dares tu obstruct our path, cr impede our progress,, Capitalism has erected its huge superstructures at the expense of the life-blood of millions of workers, whose . blood besmears the walls of mills and factories, engineering shops and mines, and still maintains its hold upon Society by the imposition of sufferings too horrible to describe. Why hesitate?  Why falter?  Why should you refrain from using similar methods and shrink and shudder from cleansing the earth from its parasitical putridity?   Only by wresting the power from the hands of these murderers by meeting force with force, violence with violence can we ever hope to establish International Communism.&quot;The report of the second meeting is of exceptionalinterest and proves that Moscow intends to continue financingrevolutionary movements in this and other countries.
&quot;The f ol3owing is e brief report on the proceed ins of an Executive Committee meeting heir! on March 12th at headquarters of the International Council of Labour Unions.   The following representatives were present: Comrades Tomeiiy, l&amp;2$Q$s&amp; , Looov&amp;y; Jans en, (Holland, Rosmer (trance), Shaolin and another (Bulgaria), Comrades Murphy and Y/atkins (xilngland).&quot;The meeting was presided over by Comrade Tomsky and the agenda consisted (1) Comrade Murphy1a report of work accomplished by British Bureau, (2) Report of the American movement and (i) Movement in Border States, Poland, Roumania, Georgia and others.&quot;Comrade Murphy1a report was handed to every English speaking representative in the form of a circular giving a full detailed account of the movement and its prevgress from the time Qf his arrival in England on December 7th, 1920, until the time of his departure in February 1921,   The pressure of business forced the Executive Committee to request Comrade Murphy to omit giving a detailed report and to confine himself to the items of greatest importance\ this was resented by Comrade Murphy until the president Suggested the translation of the whole report into Russian and a co y of the same issued, for the immediate perusal of each member of the Executive Committee.&quot;I have already reported that the statement of accounts as set forth in this report were estimated as being considerably above the expectation u:&apos;-1 the committee and it was definitely stated that in view of a limited supply of finanoe a definite sum Lfca been set apart for specific work, namely the organisinjj and convening of the International Congress and also the expenses of the delegates return journey at the termination of same.   This sum which is something like  50,000 is to bo divided into several sums to finance the work of the whole movement in the various countries The estimates of the German movement is something like  2,000 per month, the American movement also a similar amount,   A heated discussion took place betwee: Comrades Murphy and Losovsky over the methods of procedure with regard to the initial stages of the work in England, and resulted in a sub-committee being elected at this meeting for the express purpose of dealing with the question of finance in the International Trade Union or Labour Union movement. This sub-committee consists of the following three: Comrades Murphy, Losovsky and Rosmer with Shalapnikoffl as a consultative member.   The committee is to set to I work immediately with a   7iew of reporting to an adjourned meeting of the Executive. Committee to be held on Tuesday next, the 22nd March, when a survey of[ the whole work of the International and a further discussion with reference to the curtailing of the work and expenditure in our own country,   it is also very probable that an International Conference of Marine and Transport Workers will be held either in Petrpgrad or some other convenient port, it is at least being seriously considered and certain comrades have already drawn up a manifesto to be sent out to the various countries, this to take place in August and if successful should play havoc with Havelock Wilson&apos;s&apos; Cfcicru * *
&quot;I trust that the Reform Committees and Shop Stewards will take advantage of the coming mining crisis to extend their sphere of influence and work, to districts that are as yet untouched and disorganised, at least disorganised in the sense of the higher form of organisation for the complete overthrow of capitalism, Reports of same from you as&quot;often as possible will he acceptable for my information and to report progress to International Council Executive Committee regarding the further development of movement.&quot;The conference held at Sheffield last week to -unite thevarious unofficial organisations was attended by delegates from all parts of the United Kingdom but lack of moneyprevented the appearance of several representatives.&apos;   miners and engineers were prominent and it seems that the nationalorganisation which was formed will be largely controlled bythe Red International of Trade Unions.   The declared object is &quot;the overthrow of the capitalist system and the settingup of a workers&apos; dictatorship under the protection of which system of workers&apos; control and. management of industry shallbe developed,&quot; and the name &quot;The Hr.iti.onal Workers1 Committee&apos;Movement.&quot;       J.R. Campbell was elected president andT. Zimo secretary.   It ,vas decided that district anddivisional councils should be, established on a delegate basis and that there should be a national committee for eachindustrial section, delegates for which will form a NationalAdministrative Council,   The organisation will work withinand without the existing trade union movement for the purposeof bringing about rank and file control and IndustrialUnionism.The National Executive of the Electrical Trades Unionhas refused to send a dclpgato to the Moscow Congress onJu3ylst, but the London District Council are making arrangements to send one - independently.   The result of the voting in the National Union of Vehicle Workers was:Resolution in favour cf secession   )   For    39    Against  32 from Amsterdam International      )Resolution to send delegate to        )   For    33    Against   41 Moscow meeting )The /
The secretary of the Neath and District committee has issued a circular in which he states that various local union! have joined the Red International of Trade Unions:   at the sain time he has informed headquarters that &quot;the names of those branches which the circular says are affiliated are only blufl so far none have.&quot;The Glasgow Dockers have decided to affiliate with the Moscow Rod Labour International, and have instructed their Executive Council to send a delegate,   Tho recommendation came from the Exooutivo Council - wftere it was passed by a    j majority of ono - and was sent to Glasgow to signify tho       j districts approval or otherwise.   A general meeting was calif to deal with the question and, out of a membership of 6,000 just over 200 extremists attended, &quot;who voted for affiliation to Moscow.   The remainder of the dockers had nothing to say in the matter, but now some of them are grumbling at tho procedure and saying that a ballot should be taken on such a momentous question.&apos; Tho movement as a wholo, however, is making steady progress and its future will depend largely upon the present crisis.   If the trade union loaders play their cards badly the grip of the Red International will&apos; be greatly strengthenWAGE REDUCTIONS. . .   , Owing to the miners1 stoppage, interest in this question has become largely centralised.   In some industries the alleged attack on wages has been cleverly exploited by the i extremists, particularly on the Clyde, where agitators&apos; are addressing meetings, with the cognisance, but not the sanction, of the union officials.   Resolutions opposing a  I reduction are being passed by fairly large audiences and   I 1  then sent to headquarters to stiffen the resistance of.theT ; officials. I (,In the Midlands; hoy/ever, the&apos; case of the engineers M somewhat different, because although several disputes are:lprogress/
GLASGOW ftBHKD ESGINSBRSThe rebel group within the Amalgamated Engineering Ualon, to whioh reference was made in my report No. 95,&apos; has made &apos; some progress in organisation and intends to publish this week a paper entitled &quot;The Industrial News&quot;:   four thousand copies of the first issue are to bo printed and the members are/progress owing to the desire of the employers to reduce wages,the industry is seething with discontent,   A large proportionof the workers in this district realise that the high cost ofproduction is greatly restricting the engineering trade.   Ifit were not for the bitter opposition to any reduction bythe offioials of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, theywould bo only too pleased to accept a slight decrease if theywere assured of more work.   The Amalgamated Engineering union is certainly not gaining in popularity by the uncompromisingattitude of looal officials on this matter.   My correspondentgives the following instances&quot;Messrs. A, Herbert &amp; Co.v Engineers,. Butts, Coventry, recently approached their employees through the Shop Stewards end stated that if they would accepb  -about 15 per cent off their bonus, they would guarantee them at least 3 days&apos; work per week (at present they are lucky to get in two days).   The Shop Stewards themselves (although there are several local extremists amongst thorn) considered this a fair offer and recommended its acceptance to the local Amalgamated Engineering Union officials.   The latter would not hear of this being done as they stated it would be breaking the 1920 national agreement, whereby a conference of-employers and the Amalgamated Engineering Union must bo called before any wage reductions took place,   The firm then pointed out that it was only the pieceworkers whom they intended to affeot, but the union would not hear of the matter,&quot;After 3?further consideration, however, and after pressure from Herberts employees, the local union offioials havo consented to a conference with the firm at an early date.&quot;Meanwhile the workers are still on one or two days por week, and they oonsider that the firm should havo done as the &quot;Triumph&quot; did, i.e6 merely state that the reduction would take place from a certain date and defy the union.   Had Messrs. Herherfs taken this action it is probable there would have been a dispute for a few days, but that by this time all the employees would have been on at least 3 days per wook.&quot;
are pledged to push the sale in the workshops.On April End a conference of the groups was attended by B.S. Morton, Ness, Leslie of the Workers&apos; International Industrial Union and J. Brown of the Locomotive Department of Beardmore,s, Dalmuir.   Plans were   made for immediate propaganda inside Beardmore&apos;3 and Singers.   Morton is already working inside Harland &amp; Wolff1 s but claims that he has acted so carefully that there is nothing to warrant his dismissal, * .THE OOIBTJtllSTSThe Communists are elated by tho increase in their numerical strength resulting from the secession of the Left Bing of the Independent Labour Party:   although the members concerned have long been converts to communism, they will now be subject to the &quot;iron discipline&quot; of their new party. Amongst them are men of some ability such as Walton Newbold, C*H* Norman and Saklatvala.The r,arty is making headway: the circulation of &quot;The Communist&quot;, is now about 50,000 weekly and the weekly wages bill of the Party is said to amount, to  600.   It is reported that the International Socialist Club, has passed into the hands of the Communist Party without the knowledge of the members, that the brokers were in and that the Party took over a.bill of sale for  350.On April 23rd and 24th a conference will be held in Manchester for the purpose of consolidating the work of the recent Leeds meeting.The Head Office is asking branches to make a return of members in various unions with a view to&apos;arranging - . sub-committees for propaganda work:   this sphere of activity! is likely to clash with the Red international of-Trade Union!::, Branches/I
Branches In Kensington, W.*.;lworth, Edmonton and Tooting are particularly active among the imeiliploy^^aftTO^tln^ 4ia$Gt, action and the Soviet system,   The committee of the Tooting &quot;unemployables&quot; has openly declared itself to be a communist propaganda body and to have received money from the Tooting branch.Harry Pollitt, who is secretary of the London Divisional Council of the Bed International of Trade Unions, reoently expressed the opinion that the Party would be split into political and military sections.   Ho was asked where tlaa military section intend to procure arms and after asking permission of Arthur McManus, chairman of the Communist party, to reply; stated that arms and ammunition would be sent from Bussia through a certain country and from there transhipped to England.On A^ril 3rd a meeting held under the auspioea of the Wigan branch of the Communist Part; was attended by about 1,000 people:   tho streets were thronged witfo miners but the majority took no part in the meeting although the speaker. Albert V/ard, took as his subject &quot;How the miners can win&quot;t  After attaoklng the Government and the capitalists, Ward said that the Communists wanted the miners and other workers in Wigaa to form Soviets immediately, because if the Triple Alliance struck and the Government stood firm the revolution might start and tho Workers&apos; Councils must take over the. control of the industry.   He was ready to lead this revolution at. any time and reminded his audience that the workers outnumbered the master class by 10 to It   The Communists were out to alter the present system anii to preach open class warfare.   Asked if he thought the miners would be wise to compromise by aooepting a S5$ reduction in wages, Wan? replied that hewas/ &apos;
was opposed to any reduction; the doctrine of the Coqmvmigts was that wages must go higher and higher while trices went lower anil lower.On Karch 22nd Robert and fcies Stov/art were present at the branch meeting of the Leicester Co-rinnist Party,   Robert informed the meeting that when the party organisation was working properly, all members who did not obey instructions would be turned out; mon would be ordered to join the Army and Navy for the purpose of spreading disaffection,; jobs would be &quot;bought&quot; in workshops for others so that the work of overthrowing society godid be systematically organised. On March 21st James Stewart delivered an inflammatory -speech to the unemployed m Leicester market place; he told the ex-Service men that they had made a great aistake in giving up their arras on demobilisation, they should have refused- to surrender them until the Government had. fulfilled its promises,Tho Coventry branch of the Communist Party has made;-&quot; arrangements for propaganda among tho miners during the&apos; coal strike, especially in tho Hunoaton district, , &apos;Tho balance sheet of the Communist Club in Leeds shows an income for the year ending January 1st, 192.1, of  4&apos;,211. 15. 2d.

i i .present.   The speakers were Captain J.R. White, John McLean, ivl,A., John McGovorn, Peter Marshall, H, McShane, J,R, Campbell, P, Quinlan, Hendry, Grant and Liffie.   Captain V/hite, after attacking the Government, urged all Communists to continue demonstrating and organising until their comrades were released.   John McLean said ho could not agree with the attitude of John 0&apos;Sheehan, Sinn Fein organiser for Scotland, who told him that Sinn Fein   could not support the demand of tho Communists for the releaso of their comrades.   He and the Communists did all that lay in their power to further the interests of Irish independence   and thoy would continueito do so.   He thought that any Irishman who came to Scotland in search of arms and ammunition for use against the English Government was not a criminal but a patriot.   He urged those present to organise workshop and workgato meetings in support of their   demand for the release of their comrades.   McGovern advised tho workers to arise as anti-parliamentarians. Parliament was no use to them.   To Hell with Labourist as well as Capitalist Parliaments was his slogan.   The workers mu3t arise and establish communism and march over the bodies of the dead, dying and bruised capitalists,Marshall strongly urged the workers to unite in the workshops and form Soviets for the purpose of seizing control at.the opportune moment.   They must refuse any reduction in -ages, and if the bosses tried to foroe thern, then they must come out on strike &quot;en bloc&quot;.   The minors were showing the way and ho hoped to God the other workers would follow suit.A sparsely attended &quot;Release the Prisoners&apos;&apos; demonstration took place on Glasgow Green on April 3rd,   Harry Compbell, John Maclean, Harry Glass, Sandy Ross,, &quot;-Tarry McShane and Frank Duffy (Irish Labour&apos;Party) dealt with the arrest and imprisonment of members of the Communist -Party.   It was suggested that when the railwaymen and transport workersjoined/ &apos;
joined the minors, as they were bound to do, one of the oonditions of the Unions ordering a return tc work was the   unconditional release of Communist speakers.   Maclean is losing caste as even the unomployed are unable to see what good he has dono for them since he assumed the leadership of the unemployed.On March 30th members of the Glasgow Communist Group and other Communists held an anti-parliamentarian conference at 13, Burnbank Gardens,   Although the Parkhead, Shettleston and Fifeshire Communist groups are not affiliated to tho Glasgow group, they had  delegates present as fraternal representatives,   Tho principal propaganda is to be confined to meal-hcur meetings in tho workshops.    Tho speakers are to explain to the workers that it is only a waste of timo to vote at all, and to expound tho doctrines of the Communists in regard to the confiscation of the means of production and distribution.Dolegates of the Conference made a violent attack on the Communist Party of Great Britain.   This Party were more or less bolievers in parliamentary action, whereas the Glasgow Communist group were absolute adherents to Soviotism as the outlet for the will of the workers.   The Conference expressed itself solid for violent revolution, because, unfortunately, that could not bo avoided and decided to have nothing to do with the Communist Party of Great Britain, because in the first place the Party was financed by Lenin, and secondly because the revolutionary, Pranois Meynell, was a &quot;practising Roman Catholic&quot;, therefore he could not bo a full-blooded Communist,   Delegates also    I talked about money to pay the &quot;Red Army&quot; to fight against tliJ &quot;White Guards&quot;, but none of the speakers appeared to have am clear idea where the money was coming from, except through I a seizure of the banks.   A letter was read from London       Ianti/ I
anti-parliamentarian Communists promising every assistance.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYThe annual conference of tho Independent Labour Party at Easter declarod for constitutional methods:   it decided, by 521 to 97 votes, not to accept Moscow1a &quot;Twenty-one Points&quot; and, by 362&quot; to 32 vetes, to support the Vienna International,   As forecast in these reports, the rejection of the Third International resulted i$ tho secession of the Left Wing to the Communist Party,   Arthur MacManus was in . Seuthport and warmly welcomed this addition to his Party&apos;s ranks.   It is reported that the Russian Trading Delegation has been assisting the Left Wing,.The following offioers of the Independent Labour party were elected for the current year:Chairman .............R,0, VtallheadTreasurer............Philip SriowdenNational Members .....

Urban Counoil at Edmonton resulted in a substantial victory for the Union Jack candidates.   The result of tho election, however, makes no alteration in tho party composition of the council, as the retiring councillors were not labour representatives,THE &quot;DAILY BERaLD&quot; &quot;     &apos;&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is extending its^circulation push&quot; to the South Wales coalfields.   In January of this year a number&quot;of Durham lodges were circularised and asked to buy a certain number of copies of the paper for free distribution.   The South Wales miners are now being informed that 40 lodges have adopted this system and are urged to follow the.same course.   The &quot;Herald&quot; offers1,000/
1,000 -copies, jfor  6, or a small ar-number at the rate of 12s* ^ per huntrea.  although hr*ix lodges In South&apos;T?alj&amp;s^ have-agreed to order the &quot;Herald&quot; the scheme has not, 30 far, been very successful in this area.On April 1st the &quot;Drily Herald&quot; transferred its account to the Co-operative Wholesale Society^ bank,  The paper is arranging to publish a May Day annual this year,SIM ?BIg IH QR&amp;P BRITAINSinn Foin has again had resort to violence in this oountry:   a murder in London, shooting at the Polios and inoendiary fireB have occurred during the past fortnight.During the night of April 2nd -3rd incendiary firea were started in Manchester at the Albion Hotel, victoria Hotol, Blackfriars Hotel, Lyons1 Csfe, Piccadilly, and warehouses in Y/hitworth Street, Portland Street and George Street,   The incendiaries took rooms in the hotels and started the fires in their bedrooms before leaving the next morning.

Taylor &amp; Brierleyf8 warehouse in George Stroet ia estimated at  5,000.As a result of these fires the police entered an Irish Club in Erslclne Street, Bwlme:   armed resistance was offered by the suspeoted men; after a jaevere struggle, la which a police officer was obliged in self-defence to shoot a Sinn fleiner doad, police reinforcements were brought up and about 20 men arrested.   Two policemen were Injured, On a search being made at the Club.a txc-rman Service Revolver was found in a bucket of water at the top of the first fHght of stairs.   Between the 8ffiiaai.*eTifcs^^ room and the Concert Room two steps were removed-^and 12automat to/
automatic pistols and revolvers (mostly loaded), a MillTsbomb and a rifle grenade, were found packed away in a recess,fortogether with a large quantity of ammunition/ revolvers and rifles, also four boxes containing gelignite.   In tho largo Concert Room several flooring boards were removed and a considerable quantity of percussion caps and other .   ammunition was found packed between the floor joints.On April 22nd firos occurred in the Jarrow (6), Lanchester (6), Stockton (2) and Felling (l) divisions of Durham:   seven people have been taken into custody at Jarrow. Similar fires occurred in the South of Northumberland and North of Yorkshire at about the same time.   The villages in which hay stacks were fired in Northumberland were Kenton, Wallsend, Blakeland, Eastern Benton, Little Benton and Battle Hill.   One constable was knocked on the head when on his round of the farm premises in this district, but has sinoe recovered: a fire broke out immediately aftor the assault.Several fires have occurred in Kent, the most serious case bolng at Chilsfield, whexo sixteen large ricks were destroyed:   at Port Talbot farm buildings in which horses and cows were housed have been burnt down and threshing and other machinery destroyed.It is reported that explosives are still being collected in Scotland: two motor cars are said to bo employed for this purpose in Lanarkshire, &apos; &apos;IRELANDWhile de &quot;Valera has expressed his readiness to meet Sir James Oraig au.l the Prime Minister, Michael Collins has declared to an American journalist that his party will not allow thi Seating and that they are now certain of victory and an Irish Republic,   There is reason to believethat /
that he is unaer the direct control of Cohalan and Devoy in* the United States, and that a word from them might modify his attitude..  The number of outrages decreased from 317 to 896.   Of these 253 were due to Sinn ?ein activity and 9 were agrarian in origin and the remaining 34 were crimes of other serious nature   Murders and ambushes are still of almost daily occurrence.   During the week 15 murders were committed and there were 41 attempts to murder.   34 cases of highway robbery were reported and 64 cases of robbery - all with the exception of 7 being the work of Si$n Fein.One of tho most disquieting features of the present campaign of violence is the continuance of the murders of loyal Protestants.   This innovation in the Irish Republican Army murder programme has spread to the other parts of the country from Co. Cork, where it started.   There is not the slightest doubt that this is a settled policy on the part of the leaders of the murder-society, and further murders of a similar nature can be expected. it cannot be conscientiously said that any headway has been made against the Irish Republican Army and there is a feeling among the people that Sinn Fein will win.   This feeling is due to the increased prestige gained by Sinn Fein owing to its success in guerilla warfare, especially in tho martial law areas.   The fear of reprisals is not so great now.   The country folk who were opposed to the*operations of the Irish Republican Army in their localities do not now mind and although they are for the most part against murders of individuals they are in favour of ambushes   Tiioy are beginning to be provd .of tho Irish heroes who have gained such victories over the Crown Forces in spite of all restrictions imposed by Martial Law. Tho Sinn Fein papers appeared as usual.   &quot;OldIreland&quot;/
Ireland&quot; is in a particularly optimistic vein and displays a more determined attitude than it ha3 done for some time past.   It states that every move made by England since the insurrection of 1916 has been beaten &quot;by the men they shot in cold blood&quot;.   It &quot;examines the career of the mailed fist. The Black and Tans failed and the Black and Tans made the country more determined and stronger than ever.   Followed the Auxiliaries...they did not shake tho country for even one second.   Followed tho Regular Army with their armoured cars , aeroplanes, tanks, their Martial Law, death penalties, curfew, with everything tho British Empire oould devise. They failed ere they began.   They are beaten and they know they are beaten.   Macready knows it, Hamar knows it, Lloyd George knows it.   But worst of all Ireland knows it. We are not as Germany, L].oyd George, and we will go to Hell before we give in and the British Empire will go to Hell before it will succeed in beating us.   In the meantime how does she (Ireland) stand?   She stands by tho proclamation of 1916.   She stands by the gunmen.   She stands to win.&quot;This sort of literature is still being circulated in Ireland.   It is in many respects worse than the official organ of the Irish Republican Army &quot;An TT0glach&quot;, for the possession of which considerable terms of imprisonment have been imposed.* - *
