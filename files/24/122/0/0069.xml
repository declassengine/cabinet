That the remuneration of the *ien should be determined by the ability of the industry to payj2. That a standard prefit for the owners should he fixed as against a standard wage for the men; but that the standard wage of the men should be a first charge.15. That the surplus revenue should be shared between the owners and the men in proportions to be agreed, the necessary facts and figures te be ascertained by Joint Audit of the owners1 books.This agreement by coalowners to share with the men infixed preportiens the full profits of the industry narks anImportant advance in industrial relationships in this country.Unfortunatelyi this is met at its &quot;ery outset by the effectof a period Of abnormal trade depression and we fear that.as a consequence, the importance and significance of our agreement to share profits are, in tho minds of the men andthe public, overshadowed by disastrous results of the failureof trade.

Temporary arrangement for transition period. 1, That for a period of three months reductions in wages in each aroa shall be of uniform amount per shift worked
for all workmen In tho area, and shall not in any area exceed such an amount as nay be fixed by the Government, the owners and the men for each of the three months respectively.   No payment shall be made for days not worked,2. That for each month of the temporary periodascertainments shall be made upon the basis of the durable scheme; but the owners in the aggregate in any srea,(a) shall not have any share In the surplus revenue of the area if the taking of such share shall have the effect of reducing the r^te of wiges In the previous month, nor(b) shall they have their standard profits either in whole ftr in part if by the taking of either the whole or part the men in their area would on the srea results for the months be suffering a reduction in wages of more then the maximum fixed under paragraph 1 for the month,3. That the Government shall, where necessary, make sucha contribution to any srea as will prevent the reduction, after the operation of 2 (b), being more than the maximum amount for the month fixed under paragraph 1,That the temporary period for these proposals shall extend to 31st July, 1921; and thereafter the wages to be paid in each area will depend solely upon the financial ability to pay as determined under the durable scheme., 5. Per the purpose of accounting the It arch results ineach area will be applicable to Hay and June, and Hay results to July,-The wages to be pain in August under the durable scheme will be calculated by reference to the June results In each area.   No loss of either surplus or standard profits during the temporary period will be carried forward into August, but any net loss will be carried forward.
357-KOTO.These proposals are for the establishment of a durable scheme with provision for a temporary transitional period of throe months.   During this period it will be observed the proposal is that all grades of labour in the same area should suffer a uniform reduction and that in no area will the reduction exceed an amount to be fixed.   This is a variant on the original proposals made by us which render the schedules of figures previously sub-mitted inapplicable to the immediate situation.2.    7e have not ventured to Rug :est That  the maximum reductions should be.   T: is is a matter for determination in consultation between the Government and the pa/-ties since it depends upon the amount of assistance which the Government Is prepared to give.3.
