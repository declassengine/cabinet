TH DISTRICTS.4i jrwiA&amp;v?  1ft  uyjjJbiiifHXMoworandum b:r the Minister of Health.Information has reached my Department that in a certain number of mining areas relief is being given by the Poor Law Authorities to miners and their families and that the men are being encouraged by their organisations to apply for such relief,, In those cases in which I have had definite information to this effect I have drawn the attention of the Guardians to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the case of the Attorney General versus Merthyr Tydfil Guardians (1900),     This decision has generally been regarded as precluding Guardians from giving relief to strikers, altou A not precluding thorn from giving relief to the wives and families of such mono     The precise application of the decision to the present circumstances is not, however, clear, and it is possible teat if the question comes before the Courts it might be held that the action of tee Guardians in the cases now in question is legal. In one case the Solicitors to the Powell Duffryn Company have threatened to apply to the Court for an injunction to restrain the Guardians of the Merthyr Tydfil Union from granting relief to miners0In a certain number of Unions the Guardians are, as a result of the abnormal increase of relief due to unemployment during the past winter, dependent for their finances upon an overdraft- from their Bankers until the rate which has just been levied is collected.In tho particular case of the Merthyr Tydfil Union the Guardians having already an overdraft of  12,000, have applied for a further overdraft up to  40,COO and will if relief continues on the present scale, require further assistance within the next few days.- &apos; The &apos;
bankers have info-mod me that in view of the doubtful legality of the Guardians&apos; action they are unwilling to make further advanceswithout security.Such security can only be givon by a mortgage on tho rates for which my formal sanction is necessary, and in the event of the Guardians applying to me I think I have no alternative but to inform them that I cannot give such sanction unless it can be established that the expenditure for Y/hich the loan is required is lawful.    It is probable that the Guardians would bo unablo to comply with this condition and that the bank then would refuse to give the Guardians any further assistance, with the result that they may be unablo to continue relief either to the miners or to other persons who are lawfully entitled to relief.    In view of the possibilities of civil disorder of a sorious character which may result from the general withdrawal of relief I think it necessary to take the views of the Cabinet on the matter.nistry of Health.A, MOM).21st April 1921*
