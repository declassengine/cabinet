C.P. 2822* --------&apos; ENCOURAGEMENT TO, LOYAL WORKERS. &quot;   &quot;O(Note by the Minister of Transport),At an informal Conference of Ministers, which was attended by the Secretary of State for \ifarf the Home Secretary, the Secretary for Scotland, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Parliamentary Seoretary to the Ministry of Transport, and myself, there was to-day discussed the question of issuing a notice to loyal workmen in the event of on extension of the s trike to . transport workers and rallwaymen.     It was felt that a consider-able number of men would probably remain at work if some official encouragement were given to them in advance of a strike, but at the same time such encouragement should not lead the men to think that they would be retained after the strike in any temporary position to which they might have been promoted during the strike.   The Conference agreed to submit to the Cabinet the appended notice, which, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, might be issued to the English Press by tho Home Office, and to the Scottish Press by the Scottish Office.(Signed) ERIC GEDDES, PRESS NOTICE.In the event of the threatened extension of stoppage of work, the Government wish to make it clear that it will use the fullest power of the State to protect workers who remain at work in any of the services essential to the life of the Community.   In any settlement which may be come to the Government will support the Employers in such industries in securing that the position of such workers shall not be prejudiced as compared with their position before the stoppagei3, Whitehall Gardens, S.&quot;r. 11th April, 1921.
