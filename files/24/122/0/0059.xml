The decision was due to the fact that the leaders, knowing that not more than 50^ of their members would strike, seized upon the opportunity arising from Mr. Bodges&apos; statement in the Rouse.The miners remain solid but are angry at what they term &quot;betrayal&quot; by their partners in the Alliance: although there has been very little disorder distress is increasing and looting is feared in the near future.The evidenoe at present available goes to show that to-morrow&apos;s delegate conference will re-affirm the original demands of the Federation.Unemployment has greatly increased: the live register totalled 1,677,000&quot;on April 15th and 964,000 workers were on short time.The extremist leaders consider that the breakdown of tho Triple Alliance will clear the way for revolutionary organisation.The Rod International of Trade Unions has distributed unprecedented quantities of literature; many of the leaflets bear no printer1s name.   The Communist Party of Great Britain is attempt-ing to gain oontrol of this organisation.J. T. Murphy, who went to Geneva as Lenin&apos;s emissary, was refused a hearing by the Congress of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation.   When he attempted to make a speech from the gallery be was shouted down, one delegate hurling an orange at him.John MacLean and &quot;Sandy&quot; Ross are spreading reports in Glasgow that wounded British soldiers are arriving at Bellahouston Hospital from the Ruhr, where they have been fighting with the objeot of securing ooal to kill the miners&apos; strike.1
THE TRIPLE ALLIANCE DEBACLE&apos;&quot;&quot;     &apos; &apos; -   l        i i ii i .      i    .1    i    ... i .   1   i i      IIHIK .1A correspondent who is in close touch with EoclestonSquare sends the following explanation of the eleventhhour decision of the railwaymen and transport workers:-&quot;Prom the start there had been a considerable body among the full Executives of the Railwaymen and Transport Workers which was opposed to strike action. The Executives, however, were not kept fully informed and the sub-Committee of the Triple Alliance kept secret from them the faot that only 50 per oent of the Transport Workers would come out and only 60 per cent, 10 per oent of whom were doubtful, of the Railway Workers.By Friday morning the facts concerning the Railwayman had reaohed the Transport Workers and those concerning the Transport Workers had reached the Railwaymen.   When the full Executives met a railway delegate from Crowe got up and enquired in a very loud voice and with appropriate adjectives the reason why the Committees had not been informed that only 50 per cent of the Transport Workers would strike. Immediately a Transport delegate from Hull jumped on to a chair and asked in even louder tones and with a greater wealth of adjective why they had not been informed that only 50 per oont of the Railwaymen were certain to come out.   Pandemonium ensued and the Committees seized upon the split in the Miners&apos; Executive as a reason for cancelling the strike order.&quot;THE COAL MINERSSince the breakdown of the Triple Alliance strike there has been little to record beyond recriminations.   The coal miners are complaining thi-t they have been &quot;sold&quot; and &quot;betrayed&quot;.   On the one hand Mr. Hodges is acoused of having been &quot;got at&quot; and on the other Messrs. Thomas and Cramp are freely charged with having been &quot;bought&quot; by the Government.   This is the firm belief of the Russian Trading Delegation.   Many extreme Trade Unionists believe that Robert Williams and William Webb, of the Red International of Trade Unions, were working for the disruption of the Triple Alliance in the hope that the Red International would the sooner displace it.   Meanwhile, there is as yet no sign of weakening on the part of the miners.There/
There has been very little disorder in the coalfields apart from local disturbances in Scotland and one in Lancashire, but distress is becoming, acute in certain districts and, should the strike be prolonged, looting on a large scale is possible.   The situation is complicated by the increasing shortage of household coal which naturally affects the poor, who are unable to lay in stocks.   The co-operative societies are making such arrangements as are possible for the provision of necessities to the strikers, but it is unlikely that vouchers will be accepted in excess of tho trades union credit with the Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s Bank; in the case of tho miners the credit is about  250,000 only.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has started a MSave the Miners&apos; Children Fund&quot;, which, is reported to have reached  2,000: letters of appeal are to be despatched to 20,000 people and a demonstration will be held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday next.In Merthyr, where a large number of miners and their families have been granted relief by the Guardians, the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company and other colliery companies, who are ratepayers within the Merthyr&apos;Tydfil Union, have protested and their solicitors have informed the Beard of Guardians that unless,they cease to grant relief to ahle-bodied men the colliery companies will apply for an injunction.The miners in one of the largest collieries in South Yorkshire have appealed to the Company to lend&apos;them a sum of  3,000-  5,000 to distribute as out-of-work pay to their families.   Tho request has been refused on the grounds that the men could obtain work on certain terms at the collieries,, that, the , strike would/be&apos; prolonged and that there would bo no tengible security forthe/
the loan.Cn April 19th the ooal owners issued a new offer whiohcovered:A National Wages Board.National negotiation for district rates.National determination of the point below which wages shall not fall.Addition to wages of the whole of the surplus of revenue available in each district during the abnormal period.Agreement with workers as to future relation of wages and profits.Joint audit of owners1 books by accountants representing owners and workers.Conference on wages of lower paid men.Promise to satisfy local representatives that proposed local rates are highest district can bear.This offer is not clear in regard to the minimum standard and there is little doubt that ambiguity at this juncture will only retard a settlement.   Figures throughout the dispute have beon inadequately handled by the owners, and there is a very general demand for greater simplicity.   Sympathy with the miners in regard to actual wage cuts is increasing steadily and the general public is unable to understand why the various basic ratos, percentages, additions and new standards cannot be reduced to a common denominator.The miners&apos; proposal for a levy on tonnage has not been badly received and it is contended that the suggestion is not as impracticable as a national profits pool would be.   The additional cost would fall on the consumer and as regards household coal would be negligible: the effect upon those Industries whioh uee large quantities of ooal is, however, a factor to which due weight must be given in any consideration of the scheme.If the delegates to to-morrow&apos;s conference carry out their instructions/
instructions there will he an overwhelming majority in favour of tho Federations original demands, as considerably less than 100,000 opposing votes would be ca It is not unlikely, however, that the rank and file would give favourable consideration to an offer which embodied National Wages Board, a levy on tonnage for tho equalisat of district rates and reductions in wages on a sliding scale based upon the cost of living.Throughout the stoppage the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has done best to promote a general strike and has hovered round th border lino of incitement.   On Saturday, however, its disappointment and chagrin were so obvious that any reade who are not revolutionaries must realise the true aim of the paper.   Unfortunately the influence of tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is not confined to its own readers since oven a small news-sheet such es the &quot;Rutherglen Searchlight&apos;&apos; &quot;lifted&quot; the leader of Aoril 19th practically word for woTBE CCMflJMISTSThe Communists, working largely through the media of the Bed International of Trade Unions and the Unofficial Reform Committees, have devoted their attention to the cof fields and the more important&apos;industrial centres.   Speake) - have been sent from &quot;red&quot; districts to areas where the rel -element is not yet consolidated.&apos; Determined but surreptitious efforts are being made 1 the Communist Party to obtain control of tho Red international: of Trade Unions; Arthur McManus has issued to all branches &quot;statement on the attitude of the Party to the Red Trade International&quot; from which the following are extracts:&quot;Th e/
&quot;The lines upon which the propaganda of the Red Internationsi of Trade Unions was intended to go were two-fold; first, it was hoped, by persistent agitation end propaganda, to force the particular trade unions to disaffiliato from Amsterdam and line up with the Red Trade Union International.   Secondly, the endeavour to have those officials within the Trade Union movement who blindly refused to carry out such a policy of disaffiliation, where it is agreed upon, removed from office and revolutionaries put in their plaoe.   Those are the chief objects of the campaign. In order to ensure thit the Red International, once established, would not be allowed to develop on reactionary lines the same as its predecessors, a common understanding v/as arrived at between it and the Sxocutive Committee of the Communist International which enabled the latter continually to exercise a vigilant, and where necessary, strong directing influence ...&quot;This particular propagi-agenda, cpertfrom its stated objects and the type of discussion which it naturally provokes, offers a fertile soil for the Communist Party to operate on, and a soil wbicn we should not be slow to toke advantage of; but we should always r e member not to subordinate the opj?.pjrtunitiss. which the situation offers to the situation&quot;&quot;it sel: .   It is strongly advistble, at Teast, until such times as the Red International has been established, that branches should refrain from imposing their existence and direction on &apos; these local bureau:: and councils which are being set up ...&quot;The object is not to create a Red Trade Union within which the masses miflht fight, but to make the Unions within which the masses do fight into Red Unions and also to ensure in the process that control in these Red Unions is vested in the hands of those who aro accredited Communists ...&quot;Remember that the open domination of the Communist Party in the Industrial movement is a procedure which can only be attractive to, and acceptable by, those who are already Communists, and as our object is not simply to organise the Communists, but to use the Communists to organise those who are not Communists into at least machines which will be controlled by Communists, the branch members will readily see the advantage of a policy of obsourity.&quot;The Communists had made extensive preparations for the distribution of revolutionary literature in the event of action by the Triple Alliance and with unwarranted optimism hed circularised branches for toe names and addresses &quot;of all comrades who hr.ve motors, motor oycles and bicycles.&quot;   In this connection it is not uninteresting to note that Tom Quelch, who hrs been in Russia for a year, contributes,an ,article to thecurront/
current issue of the &quot;Worker&quot; in wnich he urges all comradesto &quot;be -creparod for the tasks for the morrow of therevolution&quot;.   Anticipating somewhat the progress ofevents as Moscow imagined they would occur, Quelchemphasises the necessity for the immediate utilisation ofland, wines, works and mills and tho protection of propertyfrom sabotage.The &quot;Communist&quot; has made a virulent attack uponvarious orthodox labour leaders and it is reported thatMr. J. fi. Thomas, U.P., has taken out a vjrit for libelagainst the publishers.At the recent delegate meeting of the South WalesPartyDivisional Council of the Communist/of Groat Britain it was! announced that tho Loft Wing members of the Independent Labour Perty were rapidly coming into the Party and it was decided to establish definite contact and co-operation with the South Wales Unofficial Reform movement.In Lancashire large communist meetings have been held and on April loth, Jjjoies -Hewitt, a miner and a prominent member of the locul branch of the Communist Party, incited j a crowd to attack the railway stations in lUgan and prevebtl the railwaymen working.   The police made a baton charge while Hewitt shouted:   &quot;Now Communists!   Now rebels, come 1 on&apos;.   Wo are revolutionists - Up the rebels - Up the revolution.&quot;   Host of the rioters were communists and HewitJ wae bound over on the following day to keep the peace for six months, himself in a surety of  100 and two sureties of  50 each or in default 3 months&apos; imprisonment.W; Mac Lain e has been appointed Midlands;&apos; Organiser of the Communist Party during the imprisonment of Jr.mes* Stuwa he has been &apos;!to.

Masses of literature have been ciicul&amp;ted all over tho country:   most of the-leaflets stop short of actual incitement but one, entitled &quot;Proclaim the General&apos;;-Strike&quot; h&amp;&apos;B been submitted to the . Director of Public Prosecutions.   In addition io widespread distribution this leaflet was placed on board B.H.S. &quot;Thunderer&quot; at Hosyth.The London District Council of the Red International of Trade &apos;Unions has issued a manifesto in which it is urged that the only possible reply to the employers1 attack on wages is international working class action: this can be attained/
m&quot; 8 &apos; wattained only if a strong British section of the Hod IInternational of Trade Unions is formed.   Barry Pollitt has devoted special attention to the dockers, hut aroused the anger of some of tne steadier men and, together with hit? fellow speaker, was accused on April loth, in language whici scarcely hears repetition, of being a Bolshevik.Jack Tanner intends to leave England this week:   he has credentials for the Industrial Workers of the World in &apos; Chicago end will then probably go to Russia in time for thai meeting of the Bed International of Trade Unions on July let.   The Communist Party of Great Britain has paid his fare, but lie lus asked the Shoo Stewards&apos; organisation for IZ^ &quot;pocket money&quot;.   Arthur Chapman, who ie Relieved to have been recently in Russia, will take over the editorship of &quot;Solidarity&quot; during R,anner&apos;s absence.The organisers of the Bed International of Trade Unions claim thft the breakdown of the Triple Alliance ie telling grettly in their favour: individual members of the Railway and Transport Unions, who wished to strike, show signs of riving full individual support to t:,e movement.TIB &quot;SOCIALIST&quot;This paper which is the organ of tho Socialist LabourPart;-contains, in the current issue, an article &quot;Underwhich Slag?&quot; which has been submitted to the Lord Advocate.The article is addressed to ex-Service men and is basedupon the recent incident at Edmonton.&quot;Are those men ignorant of the fact that, wherever the Union Jack floats t^ere will always he found a system of despotic tyranny?   There is Ireland; (only next door to us), suffering the tortures of the ruthless British iron heel, and struggling valiantly to overthrow the oporessors.   India, which has been described as *the brightest jewel in the British Crown&apos; is in a state of turbulence, seething with a   m growing unrest; thousands of Indians are at present   j lying in foul, stinking prisons, the victims&apos;of Britisldomination/ f]
dominationj while others are continually being arrested, thrown into jail, end often shot as rebels. Machine-guns and bomfts, thrown from aeroplanes, are used fM THE INTERESTS 0? LAW&apos;AND ORDER&apos; and here the infamous 1CRAWLING QRJW,! is in force, the natives under this dastardly regulation being compelled to CRAWL ON HANDS A^P KSSS&amp;9 before British soldiers. In Africa also the unrest, due to the same oause as thai in India and Ireland, is spreading, the bl&amp;cks being mercilessly persecuted, along with the white working class, for taking part in strikes and riots against the British taskmasters.   Even in Britain the oppression is going on, though, perhaps, not quite so openly; it is being done more SUBTLY.   The bosses, aided and abetted by their executive committee, the British Government, are ruthlessly waging a war on the wages oi the workers, bringing wages down they wish.   In times of strikes the Government is ALWAYS on the employers&apos; side, and will call out the police and military armed with RIFLES, BARBED WIRE, AEROPLANES AND TANKS, et the employers&apos; request; but in the 1 INTERESTS OF LA&apos;-&apos; AMD ORDER&apos; is what TREY style it. IT IS THE CLASS WAR,   A war between the wage-slaves and their taskmasters.   EX-SERVICE -SEN1.   Thousands of the soldiers and sailors who went end fought for THEIR (?) &quot;King and country&apos;, deluded with the glib promises of oily-tongued parsons, politicians and press, are now facing the grim spectre of STARVATION &apos;with their backs to the wall&apos;.   &apos;.7e read of cases of men committing Buicide rather than live end see their children starve; we find ex-warriors begging with boxes in the streets, turning hurdy-gurdys, and hawking laces and such like articles.   We find medals and decorations in the pawnshops, *;nd the men who earned them IN TBS WORK-ROUSES.   Pensions, misersble, paltry things *?s they are, ere being reduced, if not completely stopped; while the crippled and blinded heroes THAT WERE are defending mostly on charities for their existence. All this misery, all this sacrifice, AND NOTHING GAINED, by those who have sacrificed.   But the employers and the aristocratic classes have gained, for BEY have waxed fat and have become bloated with opulence AT THE WORKERS&apos; EXPENSE.   And yet we find men who will still fight for the Union Jack, which is , the symbol of oppression i nd slavery of the toiling masses the world over.    BY FIGHT FOR SUCH A FLAG? Why.not rather reserve your fighting energy for the day, NOT FAR DISTANT, when the red, revolutionary banner of revolt shall become unfurled?   The Red Flag is the only flag that is-worth fighting for, because you get what you fight for.   Ixi the words of John S. Clarke j &apos;Well, Thomas.   Kerens e comradely and cordial invitation to do your bit to win your native land; to battle for the triumph1 of your OWN emancipation, and GET the thing you fight for&apos;- understand?   Let Union Jacks and tricolours be symbols of the brainless.   Cornel   fight beneath the blood-red oriflamme, the only flag the wide world o&apos;er, unsullied, pure and stainless, THE ONLY FLAG ON EARTH,, THAT&apos; 3 -WORTH A DAMtU&apos;11,INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTS &apos;&quot;&apos; -,i    , &apos; -      ------The National idminietrrtive Council of tho IndependentLabour/
Labour Party has passed and issued the following &quot;Support theMiners&quot; resolution.&quot;The present critical industrial situation is caused by an attempt on the part of organised capitalism to \, establish a right of unlimited plunder.   It must be resisted at all costs, for it is not only an attack on the miners, but the beginning of on offensive against the standard of life of the whole community.&quot;Despite all inoonveniences the workers should stand by the miners, for though their standard of living is scheduled for reduction to-day, others will soon follow, and Lt-Vour will be outmanoeuvred again if it does not realise that the interest of the whole working class is cone er?.)Jd.&quot;The Independent Labour Party denieB the right of capital to decide who shall suffer, and declares that the arbitrary reduction of wages by a handful of employers can no longer be tolerated.   It must be understood and established thfft the first charge on Industry is the adequate means of livelihood for all the workers engaged in it.&quot;The Independent Labour Party therefore calls on all its members to supp ort tjie minors by ovary means in their power.     It urges the utmost&quot; resistance to all attempts to reduce the standard of living, and declares its belief tha once suoh reduction is applied to the miners the earliest opportunity will be taken to force similar conditions on the rest of the workers throughout the country.&quot;In the socialisation of the mines and other essenti industries, with their ownership and control by and for the community, will be found the remedy for recurring attacks on wagas and the only means whereby individualist! capitalism gives way to the common good.&quot;mj DAYOn the Continent there is still talk of a, worldwide labour movement on Hay 1st, in whioh, the Triple Alliance will function; there is, however, very little prospect of any ooncerted movement in Great Britain, although, as Hay Day happens, to fall on a Sunday, the celebrations will probably be on a more extensive scale than heretofore.COHVIOTIOKSOn April 12th a Pole named Vinoenty podralski wassentenced at Liverpool to three months imprisonment with hard!labour/
labour on a charge of attempting to promote industrial unrest and recommended for deportation.   Podralski arrived at Liverpool from America on April 5th and addressed a meeting of unemployed builders at tho Old Custom Houso Place.On April 15th James Stewart, Midlands organisor of the Communist Party of Great Britain, was sentenced at Vfolverhampton to one month1s imprisonment with hard labour for attempting to oause disaffection among the civilian population by a speech made on April 8th.FEIN IN SR5AT britain on April 6th a secret conference of Sinn Feinars, members of the Irish Republican Army and the Seoret Service leaders, was held in a hall at 34, High Street, Edinburgh.   Representatives wore present from the West of Scotland, Edinburgh District and North of iingland.   Officials were appointed to an Officers&apos; Board to form two flying columns, one in tho West and the other in the Eastern districts of Scotland and the North of England. Sinn Fein Clubs were called upon to report to Headquarters what they had done in the way of reprisals.   It was stated that taking into consideration the amount of money spent on the Irish Republican Army the results have not been satisfactory.   The-present time presented a most favourable opportunity for the members to become active.   Railway lines, Bridges and Docks, were to continue to be objects of special attention to the Irish Republican Army.   A Sinn tfein vendetta was also considered. Kidnapping of public officials found great favour, but no resolution was taken.   A proposal to burn farms in Midlothian was rejected but violent explosions in the West of Scotland were decided upon.   The Sinn 3Vin activities in the West of Scotland were regarded as being so far a failure: it was stated thatabundance/
abundance of explosives could be obtained from Broxburn, Drumshoreland, Bowhill and Cowdenbeath.In London there has been an e-pidemic of damaging plate glass windows with a diamond.   As the same thing was done in Liverpool at the time of the 3inn Fein outrages it is suspeo&apos; that Irish women are the perpetrators.IRELANDConsiderable irritation has been oaused by tho methods Sinn Fein Flying Columns which oommandeer food throughout th country.   It is reported that attacks on the Crown Forces on large soale are to be expected shortly and^hat Sinn Fein is rallying the young men to the colours.   There have been org attempts to destroy the Military and Police transport in anticipation of a new move.The murdering of alleged spies continues and this organ form of terrorism must clearly bear the approval of Dail EirCorrespondents oontinue to draw attention to the enrol oy of women in the Sinn Fein Intelligence. When outrages occur arms are carried by the women to the point of attack, used I men and immediately handed back to the women. It has been suggested that in order to combat effectively tfre employment Sinn Fein women in this work, a body of women must be formed would be able to accompany parties detailed to make arrests] raids and assist the Crown Forces in searching the women wh be detained.The &quot;department of Trade and Commerce&quot; of the Dail Sin has issued an order which forbids the importation from Englf of agricultural implements.   Lists prohibiting other articlf are to be issued from time to time until a general exclusiof English goods can be declared.   To ensure the success of thpolicy/
policy foreign manufacturers and merchants have been advised to take advantage of the opportunity.In Great Britain the wave of incendiarism has for the moment died down. , This no doubt is due partly to the exemplary sentences passod recently at Liverpool and partly to the fact that the directors and organisers of these outrages have been watohing the trend of affairs in the industrial crisis.   The Sinn Feiners are very much disappointed by the turn of events and blame Mr, Thomas wholeheartedly.Cardinal %nnix has returned from Rome.   He is saying that if he were allowed to go to Ireland he would act as a peacemaker.A prominent Irish leader is alleged to have stated in an interview that the only way to peace is (l) by the immediate withdrawal of the invading array, (2) oy the acknowledgment of Ireland&quot;s right to complete self-determination and (3) by negotiations between the representatives of the two nations, meeting on a footing of equality.Much comment has been made on the &quot;statement issued by the Prime Minister in the press of April 20th as a reply to the oommittee of Bishops and satisfaction is expressed at the firm attitude of the Government.The situation in the South seems to be steadily improving and it is said that many members of the Irish Republican Army would gladly return to their homes if they felt that they would not be interfered with by the Crown Forces,   The leaders, however, play on their fears fcy telling them that they would be the victims of terrible outrages.There are indications that a certain number of paid and trained agents are at work in Ireland.
