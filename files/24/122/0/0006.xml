(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS 3HITAHUIC EUBSTY&apos;8 GOVERUMSHT) SECRET.CABINETCPc 2606.WB&quot; MANDATES. Memorandum by the President, Board of Education.Tho Secretary of State for War has circulated two Memoranda (CP. 2361 and C,P,2734) advocating the external use of Native Troops in the African Territories for which we have accepted or propose to accept Mandates,    The argument is that sinceuthe tfronah have refused to be bound in their Mandates by the express restrictions of Article XXII of the Covenant, we should equally repudiate our obj&amp;gad&amp;on to observe that portion of the I-treaty of Versailles^from this recommendation I dissent.    fl-he words of Article XXII of the Covenant ox the League are quite explicit. They pledge the Power accepting what is now commonly known as a &quot;B&quot; Mandate to prevent nthe military training of the Natives &quot;for other than police purposes and the defence of territory&quot;. There aret therefore, only two courses honourably open to us. We must either frame our Mandate in conformity with the terms of the Covenant or we must press for a revision of Article XXII&apos; I hope that whatever the tfrench may do* we shall adopt the fVst of these two courses.    I am convinced that public opinion inthis Country and elsewhere would bo greatly shockod if it were*thought for a moment that the British Government were proposing to use its newly acquired rights over African territory for tho purpose of raising largo Blaok Armios either to take part- &amp;n European quarre-s or, as would inevitably be alleged9 to quell labour troubles at home,(Bgd.) H.A.L. FTPffW-.Board of Education, 7th Aprils 1921.
