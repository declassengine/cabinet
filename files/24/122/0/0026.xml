The Soviet Naval General Staff are preparing to transfer several Submarines from the Baltic to the Black Sea.   A discussion v/as also held to transfer the War Fleet from &quot;Kronstadt to Murmansk in view of the general consideration that when Russia is again restored, the base of the Soviet Russian
Fleet should &quot;be in the Arctic Ocean.     There is nothing at Murmansk in the way of necessary equipment, and it is extremely doubtful whether the project will ever pass beyond the dissussfcn starve with the exception, possibly, of a decision to form a snail base at l/Iurmansk, such as the Submarine Base recently decided upon.   The Soviet Government have accepted the British proposals regarding their Submarines (to approach British Warships on the surface during daylight hours and with colours flying), and have issued the necessary instructions.Petrograd is reported to be preparing for the opening of navigation and expected the development of foreign trade due to the signing of the Anglos-Russian Trade Agreement.

If the Japanese ask to land the Turks in a neutral country, this is to be allowed.TURKEY.The Turkish Government has protested apainst the Greeks using the Straits and the Sea of Marmora for military purposes, on the grounds that Greece is carrying on an offensive without a mandate from the Allies, who have  laid down that these are neutral zones, in which no military operations can be permitted.   (N.B. This proviso forms part of the unratified treaty, and the question is governed by the terms of the Ariistice with Turkey).H.: .S. 8Centaur&quot;, with the body of the Greek PatriarrclL.-... left Brindisi on 8th April, and arrived at Constantinople on 9th April.DANUB.E,H.&apos;I,S. &quot;Glowworm&quot; left Galatz for Sulina on 10th April,    She is shortly due at Malta for refit, when she will be relieved on the Danube by H.&amp;.S. &quot;Ladybird&quot;.Owing to lack of accommodation in H.Iu.S. &quot;Ladybird^ S.N.O., Danube will live ashore during this period, flying his Pendant in M.L.196.NORTH    AMERICA.The Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies proposes to hoist his flag in &quot;Calcutta&quot; on 9th April and visit the Lesser Antilles, returning to Bermuda in the middle of May* when his flag will be transferred to &quot;Ralei^i&quot;.J A PAN.The Budget has passed the Diet and provide 498&apos;6 million Yen for the Navy for 1921-22, and a supplementary sum of 40 million Yen to cover the deficit incurred in 1920-21.3.  &apos; I g A L Y.The fRegina JILena1-will be withdrawn-from Torpedo School duties in Jfiay, and will &quot;beooma cadets1 traijaij^ahif.The &quot;F.Ferruccio&quot; and &quot;Varese^ will then be with-drawn from service and sold.The &quot;A.Vespucci^ will be fitted with 2 Diosel engines4 giving her a speed of 8 knots, and will be continued in her present service.

The arrest will probably have a good effect.A foroe has also been despatched to arrest the Governor of Kuchan.FINLAND.Dr. Vennola has formed a Government from the Finnish Radical Centre parties, with M.

In this Treaty Batoum is rocognised as Georgian, and Nokhichevan as autonomous territority under tho protection of Azerbaijan.

Tho GCrman Government has expressed great satisfaction and is considering in return the abolition of all taxes on Brazilian coffee.The BriBish Minister to Brazil has pointed out that this may materially affect tho views of the British Government as to the disposal of ex-German ships interned in Brazil, the allocation of which is still under discussion by the CouncD of Ambassadors.

He is displeasing to the Sultan, but stands well with the Heir Apparent, and if he has a constructive programme, it may involve supersession of the Sultan, against v/Lom there is strong feeling in many Nationalist oiroles.
