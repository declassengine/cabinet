CcThis Docurki08 OTcyof, lent.CABINETLOCHAB&amp;jR WATEB ?OtfER BILL AND THE GRAMPIAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY BILL,Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.A question of policy on which a decision is required without delay, arises on the above Bills, which have already been read a second time in the House of Commons and will shortly be in committee.In 1918, the British Aluminium Company sought Parliamentary powers to enable them to carry out a scheme somewhat similar to the present Loohaber scheme, but the Bill was successfully opposed in the Lords, at the instigation of local interests, and withdrawn.    Meanwhile the Company had consulted the Board of Trade and agreed to the insertion of a olause in the Bill providing for the payment of royalties to the State at the rate of  /- per horse power.     In 1919 further negotiations were entered into and the Chairman of the Company indicated that they might be prepared to consider a proposal that the work should revert to the State free of cost at the end of 99 years.The new Lochaber Bill, recently presented, which will be in Committee in a few days, has good prospects of becoming law, and this time it is acoompaniod by another Bill relating to the Grampians.   These Bills provide for the exploitation of water power over very extensive areas, but in neither is there any provision for ultimate reversion to the State or for the payment of royalties to the State and it is understood that the promoters are not prepared to insert clauses of this/nature
nature voluntarily.In my opinion the Cabinet should consider whether we should allow the Grampian and Loohaber Bills to proceed with-out clauses protecting the future interests of the community.It must be remembered that Water Power installations are practically permanent, that their value in the future may become enormous and that in most advanced countries the State exacts payment from or retains rights over them.     In this connection it should also be recalled that the Water power Resources Committee, appointed by the Government some time ago, have made it clear from their interim reports that they will recommend some form of State interest in the development of Water Power;   and that a Bill to give effect to this, which was not proceeded with, was drawn up by the Bpard of Trade and approved by the Cabinet in 1919.Decision is sought on the question whether we should insist on the insertion of clauses providing (a) for the payment of royalties to the State;   (b) for the reversion of the under-taking to the State after a period of years.I should judge that at this stage there is more to be said for the second proposal than for the first, but If any conditionsof this kind are imposed they should certainly not be of anonerous character.    If the Cabinet decides on the impositionof such a condition, I should suggest no more than the insertion in the Bills of clauses giving the State the option to acquire the rights and concessions and the permanent or immovable works at the end of a term of years, on payment by the State of com-pensation equal to the actual cost of the works less depreoia-tion, or replacement cost, whichever is the less.(Signed).   STANLEY BALDWIN.-9. 4. 21.
