SUMMARY.GENERA.L.As the Russian Soviet Government becomes weaker at home its activities abroad increase. Its only hope now lies in prolonging tho existence of the Third International, and the revolutionaries in all countries are looking to it for financial support.The general move to the Right, what was commented on in the last Report, has not, yet spent itself, but reaction must come, and therefore the importance of chocking revolutionary propaganda emanating from the Third International is very great.The Third International is carrying on which was intended to be a co-ordinated.offensive in foreign countries. Much travelling and a great outpouring of money are reported during March, and there are reports, not yet fully confirmed, that the Soviet Authorities have committed acts since the signing of the Trade Agreement which are breaches of their declaration against propaganda in this country. Its one desire is to keep Communist principles alive.RUSSIA.The event of tho month is the fust serious admission by the Soviet authorities of fundamental defects in their application of tho Communist system of government.Reports of the proceedings of the 10th All-Hussian Congress of Soviets show that Bolshevik doctrine is undergoing considerable changes and modifications.The most significant discussion at the Congress was that on Bolshevik agricultural policy, and the relations of the Soviet government and the peasants a subject dealt with in the first article in Part 2 of this issue.Lenin has come to the conclusion that &quot; to preserve the power of the proletariat, with the peasants against us and with the world revolutionslowing down, is impossible.....In order to keep power morefirmly in tho hands of the proletariat we must satisfy the peasantseconomically and agree to the freedom of exchange.....Wemust build up our State economy to correspond with the economy of the middle peasant, which wo have not been able to change.1&apos;There is every indication that this change is the direct result of the peasant risings, which became general throughout Soviet Russia in the course of February and March.The economic situation is no hotter, and there is scant prospect of its improvement before the autumn of 1922 at earliest. All reports emphasise tho completeness of the economic collapse. The former daily food ration now has to serve for two days, and may ere long have to serve for five. The authorities admit that the supply of boots will only provide one pair for every 2,500 persons.The 1920 combined production programme of all the principal metallurgic and mechanical plants in Russia covers 10 per cent, of their normal capacity, and only 24 per cent, of tho 1920 programme was carried out. Of a so-called &quot;shock group&quot; of 22 engineering works organised in 1920 only 12 remained active in January 1921. On the Volga and Dnieper tho cessation of dredging has caused the rivers to
he come dangerously shallow, and may stop navigation altogether this year.Even the most drastic measures are failing to keep the workmen to their factories, which they take every chance of leaving to earn their bread as farm hands or small craftsmen in the villages. Workmen -remaining at the plants often live largely on bread obtained by exchanging with the peasants small household articles which they produce for themselves.It is considered highly doubtful whether Russia will undertake an offensive this spring. Lenin prefers to compromise with the peasants to endeavour to reconstruct the country economically. The reconstruction is likely to follow &quot;small capitalist&quot; lines. Communism checked at home will probably redouble its propaganda abroad in order to keep its principles alive.In the autumn a Russian offensive would have more value, and the Polish and Roumanian harvests might repay a short campaign. As Russia has to make concessions internally she will probably double her propaganda abroad.Krassiu is reported to have taken to London instructions for the co-ordination of the Irish revolutionary movement, and Litviuoif is very reliably stated to have been instructed by Zinoviefl on March 29th to arm Bolshevik &quot; germ cells&quot; in Dublin, and subsidise them through Krassin to the amount of 50,000/. If true this action constitutes a definite breach of the Trade Agreement.Special attention is drawn to Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Part 2 in this issue.SIBERIA.Reports of peasant insurrections during the last weeks of 1920 continue to arrive. They appear to havo been due to the peasants&apos; realisation that they are faced with economic political slavery. The insurrections lacked co-ordination and were suppressed. The peasants are now organising their own union.ESTHONIA.Litvinoff, having consistently advised the Soviet Foreign Office that the trade agreement in London would uever be signed, is believed to be partially discredited, and may be movod on to America as the successor to Martens in case American trade policy in Soviet Russia should change. His appointment to Reval resulted in increased activity of the political section of the delegation there in propaganda and agitation abroad.4PRANCE.Communist propaganda does not diminish, but Communism is reported to be losing ground. Partisans of the Second International, who, while not fundamentally opposed to Communism, reject the methods and rule of Moscow, have been active. Communists are exploiting the unemploy-ment crisis to counteract Moderate Socialist propaganda. A scheme is being framed to bring about an understanding between the Dissident Socialists and the Communists. Among young soldiers and sailors, in France propaganda is becoming disquieting, but the authorities have the anti-militarist movement under observation.The acquittal of the Communist leaders made a bad impression on tho public, who agreed with tho jury that dangerous thinking and the
expression of dangerous doctrines cannot ho called conspiracy. It hinted that the date of the trial was chosen to coincide with the Governments hunt of Communists and tho candidature of Loriot and Souvarine for the Chamber in two divisions of the Paris district.ITALY.The month has been dominated by the hitter struggle between Fascist! and Communists. The policy of the Government is to play oft the former against the latter, isolated since the split in the Socialist Party. The use by the Fascisti of tho tacit consent to their activities has in many cases amounted to abuse.Tho Congress of the Italian Federation of Labour at Leghorn ended by leaving the Federation midway between Amsterdam and Moscow and risking excommunication by both.The Russian Soviet Mission, headed by Vorovsky, has arrived in Rome. Vorovsky admits that Count Sforza is doing his utmost to stabilise trade relations between the countries, but hints that if opposition is not controlled he may be forced to leave.Sinn Fein propaganda continues in the Italian press without marked results.SPAIN.Unemployment is spreading, with much talk of sabotage and of designs on (he liberty of the workers. Measures in repression of syndicalism are reported to have been largely successful, and resistance is becoming more and more spasmodic and indirect.Certain separatist organs continue the pro-Sinn Fein campaign. Sinn Feiners are in communication with the separatists in Catalonia and the Basque Provinces.SWEDEN.Beneath the workers&apos; superficial calm there is unrest, due to bad economic conditions, growing unemployment, the prospect of wage reductions, and the difficult economic future.HOLLAND.An International anti-militarist Congress was held at The Hague towards the end of March for the purpose of founding a species of anti-militarist international,GERMANY.The responsibility for the series of Communist explosions which occurred in the centre of Germany round about Easter arose from no spontaneous revolutionary spirit, and is believed to. have been due to hurried orders from Moscow. The national Communist movement in Germany and Bavaria, in the latter of which members of the Orgescli are coquetting with the Communist Party, is an instance of Moscow&apos;s attempted welding of opposites.The resignations of Levi, Klara Zetkin, and other Communist leaders from the Central Committee of the United Communist Party was due to local conditions;&apos; Neither Brandler nor Stoecker can compare in ability and influence with their predecessors.
SWITZERLAND.Communist loaders believe that the immediate prospects of their own party are unfavourable, but are cheered by the economic crisis. Swiss public opinion would appear to see in the signing of the trade agreement between Great Britain and Russia a betrayal of European civilisation, a prolongation of Soviet rule, and an extension of its maleficent influence in Europe.The Swiss Socialist Party has been greatly disturbed by recent adverse votes on adhesion to the Third International and suppression of the military tribunals.AUSTRIA.Communist activities continue. Results are incommensurate with the propaganda put forth.Iti the sporadic outbreaks into which the genera! Communist revo-iiitionary offensive has resolved itself, Austria will take no part. As an asylum for the refugee communists from Hungary, Jugo-Slavia, and Bavaria, the refuge she affords is too valuable to be prejudiced by hasty and unconcerted action.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.There is a grave economic crisis, and unemployment in certain districts is general. The discharge of workers has been resented by the men and iu some cases followed by a Communist seizure of factories. The activities of the Hillersou Mission are on the wane. Bolshevism is crippled by internal disputes.TURKEY.An abstract of the terms of the Russo-Polish Treaty signed on March 16th is given. The Turks&apos; acceptance of the Russian terms is noted to be very conditional, and they appear to have entered into what tbey know to be a fallacious agreemeut with Russia under outside pressure.GEORGIA.With the capture of Kutais, the last foothold of the overthrown Georgian government, Georgia has become completely Red.TURKESTAN.Suritz, the Soviet envoy at Kabul, has been complaining of tho uon-fulfilment of Moscovv&apos;s promises of funds, owing to which he is no longer able to finance some of Djemal Pasha&apos;s projects to which he had committed himself.AFGHANISTAN.On March 3rd Moscow announced that the treaty between Russia and Afghanistan had been signed at Moscow on February 28th.CHINA.The Soviet Mission at Pekin has failed, and the Chinese government is reported finally to have declined a Soviet trade delegation.
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.It would appear that the struggle between capital and labour cannot be much longer delayed. Employers wish to break the iron-clad rule of the &quot; closed shop,&quot; while by the Unions &quot; open shops &quot; are stigmatised as unfair. There is an increase of unemployment, especially in the south aud west, although in New England some of the leading industries have been somewhat more active.The larger policy of the United States with regard to trade with Soviet Russia is expressed in a message to the Soviet representative at Reval from Mr. Hughes, Secretary of State, which, while expressing sympathy with the Russian people, states that it is idle to expect resumption of trade until the economic basis of production is securely established.ARGENTINE.The prevalent anarchy appears to have at length aroused tho author-itios. Tho conflict between the Mihanovitch Company and the Maritime Works Federation having been settled by agreement, passenger services wore resumed on March 20th, after a yoar&apos;s suspension.
CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT No. 28, FEBRUARY 1921.Erratum.Page 61, tenth line from bottom of page.   For &quot; to &quot; read &quot;from.&quot;A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Communist Activities.Though Communist propaganda does not diminish, Communism is reported to be losing ground. The partisans of (lie Second International have been active. They are not fundamentally opposed to Communism, but reject the methods and ride of Moscow. It was indicated that big meetings for anti-Soviet propaganda would be organised in Paris, and the provinces after the Vienna International, meetings in which (he Libertaire Anarchists were to join forces with the Moderates. The moral conviction of the Anarchist leaders that Trotsky was voluntarily responsible for the deaths of Vergeat, Raymond Lefebre, and Le Pel it has been strengthened by the arrival in France of letters from the victims, full of bitter criticisms of the Moscow regime.The Communists are exploiting the unemployment crisis in order to counteract the moderate socialist propaganda. Early in March there were 700,000 unemployed in the Seine region being indoctrinated with statements that a Soviet regime would mean work for all. Since their expulsion from the Confederation Generale du Travail, the Communists have been obliged to form an independent committee which will fight the alleged tendencies of the Confederation General du Travail towards compromise with the Government. The Communists oppose the use of force against Germany, so opposing the Dissident Socialists. The working classes are reported to be not altogether averse from a military enterprise, which would, they believe, alleviate the situation in France,, If France mobilised against Germany, in agreement with Great Britain, such leaders of the Dissident Socialists as Longuet and Paul Faure Avould be the first to uphold her action.A scheme is being framed to bring about an understanding between the Dissident Socialists and the Communists. It is hoped that the Communists, without abandoning the principles of the Third International, will consent to subordinate the orders of Moscow to those of the directing committee of the Third International sitting in the capital city selected for the annual International Congress. If the agreement is made, Moscow will have contact with all the socialists, through thecommittee, and will
not give direct orders to the French Socialist Party. The union of the two factions would mean the triumph of Socialism over the other Left Parties, and would principally hit the Radicals and the Republican Left. Tho Commission of Permanent Action of the Communist Party has voted the sum of 60,000 francs to intensify propaganda in the provinces. Rappoport made an alarmist speech dealing with the &quot;formidable army&quot; of the Soviet, which he alleged was being equipped principally from France and Great Britain. Germany was supplying a most deadly poison gas, of which a quantity contained in a 155-mm. shell would sullice to destroy an army corps. The rumour, which should be taken with great caution, is current in Communist centres that Lenin and Trotsky are shortly calling a constituent assembly in order to counter the statement of foreign countries that the Soviet Government does not represent Russia as a whole.Communist orators are reported to be becoming more moderate. They are trying to win over the heavily taxed small traders and petite bourgeoisie by declarations that the Communist regime will not affect them, but will touch only the industrial and financial magnates whose firms and works will be monopolised after an indemnity has been paid to the owners. The small capital of workers and old people will be respected. Such of these people its possess no capital will receive a share of the surplus of the rich. This propaganda has not been without reassuring effect. At the by-election of the second Sector of Paris, 15,000 votes of small traders, capitalists and functionaries seem to have gone to Loriot and Sottvarine. The Communist Party is working hard to re-create the unity of the Socialist Party.The National Federation of Young Communist Socialists of France has issued an inflammatory leaflet to conscripts of the 1921 class of French recruits preaching anti-militarism and the Communist revolution.Extremists and the Peasantry.In &quot; L&apos;IIumanite &quot; Jean Renaud discusses the difficulty of Communist propaganda among the peasants. The system of small holdings resists and develops. Renaud affirms that what is happening in France con-tradicts Socialist theories. The modern history of the countryside consists in tho attack of the landless on the great estates. But tho victory is easily lost through individual faults, and the peasants sou becomes a worker for others. Renaud insists that propaganda must point out the bitterness of the struggle and tho instability of victory, and cou-trasls with it the Socialist organisation which will give the land to, and keep it for, those who work upon it.The Socialist campaign in the country is taking the form of an advocacy of a &quot;social democratic communist regime,&quot; conciliating the feelings of the peasants on the ownership of land. The orators speak under the auspices of the &quot;Ligue des Droits de ITIomme,&quot; and develop attacks on great landoAvners, and promises of re-distribution of land to &quot; metayers &quot; and small farmers.&quot; Intellectual Workers of the World.&quot;The leaders of the Paris centre of the Communist International are reported to have succeeded in founding a &quot; Federation of Intellectual Workers of the World,&quot; which is to unite all brain workers in active intellectual Bolshevism. The Association was founded in December of last year, and at the end of January 1921 had received 50,000 applica-tions for enrolment.   National Federations, meant to be sections of the
u International of Brains,&quot; are being formed in tho U.K., U.S.A., Belgium, and Italy.The Confederation Generate du Travail and Extremists.The reaction of the moderate sections of the C.G.T. against the extremists has resulted in an extensive destruction of Communist &quot; cells.&quot; In some provincial unions, such as those at Marseilles, small Communist successes are recorded, but the C.G.T. is, as a whole, moving distinctly against Moscow. In conformity with its decision, the Executive Com-mitteeof the Federation of Employees (black-coated workers) has decided to exclude syndicalist revolutionary committees. These have, however, right of appeal to the Federal Council.The campaign of the C.G.T. against the Communists is being actively opposed by the latter, who consider Jouhaux and the eonfederal officers as traitors to the working classes. There are signs that certain big Trades Unions, such as the metal workers, are moving towards Com-munisin. The metal workers of the Loire basin have adhered to the Third International and asked for the expulsion of Merrheim, the preseut secretary, in favour of the Communist Andrieux of St. Etienne. The struggle between tho two parties on the first of May was expected to be severe. Communist propaganda among young soldiers and sailors in France (not on tho Rhine) is becoming very disquieting. Toulon would appear to be a special hot-bed of Communist agitation in the fleet. The authorities have the anti-iftilitarist movement under close observation.The arrests of Young Communists for anti-militarist propaganda are reported to bo typical of occurrences when a new class is called up.On a secend ballot the second electoral division of Paris, comprising the working class East End, returned the Bloc National candidates by 70,000 against 58,000 for the Bolshevik Socialists. The Dissident and other non-Bolshevik Socialist candidates had retired. Among thedefeated candidates were Loriot and Souvarine.It is reported that no law can be found in the French Code penalising Abramovitch and his associates for the &quot; offences of opinion &quot; alleged against them. It is suggested that the whole affair was to blind the police in order to conceal better the real Bolshevik agents and their methods of working.The Recent Trials.The acquittal of the Communist leaders is reported to have made a bad impression ou the public. The view of the jury was apparently that dangerous thinking, and even the expression of dangerous doctrines, cannot be considered a conspiracy. The resolution passed by the jury and refused by the judge demanding habeas corpus lin France is said to be without precedent in French annals.The acquittal was made the occasion of the biggest Red demonstra-tion Paris has yet seen. A great gathering was held at St. Denis, at which Cachin was the chief speaker. He delivered a violent address, in which he said that the mistake of the old Communists in not going to Versailles and throughout France must be avoided when the working class again obtained possession of Paris. The proletariat must have its military force, which would bring about the end of war and capitalism.It is suggested that the date of the trial of the men charged with plotting against the security of the State was chosen to coincide with the Governments hunt of Communists and with the candidature of Loriot and Souvarine for the Chamber in two divisions of the Paris district.
But the acquittal was not altogether unexpected, given the policy of internal pacitication of the Briaud Cabinet. Loriot, one of the prisoners, has been rewarded with the general secretaryship of the Union des Syndients, on the proposal of Tommasi, who resigned this post in Loriot&apos;s favour, and with a monthly personal subvention of 1,500 francs. This generosity is accounted for by tho fact that the Minister of Public Instruction has forbidden Loriot, who had been a teacher for 21 years, to resume his post.Miscellaneous.For France the question of relations with Soviet Russia continues to be largely a question of recognition of debts. It is understood that Steehkovsky, the Polish Secretary of the Delegation in Riga, was given permission in February to investigate the political intentions of the Soviet Government in this respect.Professor B. K. Sirkar is giving a free course of six lectures at the University of Paris on the subject of &quot; Le Droit Public des Ilindous.&quot; One, M. Gleizes, has been distributing in Paris maijy notices advertising these lectures. M. Gleizes and his wife are active Communist agents, and act as liaison between France and Switzerland.The relations of Nihad Reshad with the extreme wing of the French Socialist Party are said to bo growing more intimate. He is reported to have made a tentative offer to the editor of &quot; LTlumanite &quot; to take up the Turkish Nationalist cause in its columns.A report that the workers at the &quot; Societe Generale des Entreprises &quot; at Argenteuil had set up a Soviet in the works turns out to have little foundation. What happened was that the company found itself obliged to discharge 100 workers, who decided, nevertheless, to continue work, and took possession of the workshops, over which they hoisted the red Hag.   The police kept the workers under discreet observation.BELGIUM.The Economic and Industrial Situation.There is little change in the Labour and Industrial situation. In the metal industry some signs of improvement are apparent, but in other trades unemployment has slightly increased. There were several cases of &quot; occupation &quot; of works in Belgium in the first half of February, but they resulted in no serious damage or disorder, and in no case did the &quot; occupation &quot; exceed a few hours.The situation in the mining areas is on the whole calm. The 5 per cent, reduction in wages which came into force on March 1st was accepted without great opposition. The Executive Committee of the Federation of Miners has decided to refuse further support to any unions that refuse affiliation to the National Federation on or before May 1st, 1921. This should check extremist propaganda among the smaller unions. Tram-waymen, textile and other workers aro showing considerable discontent at proposed wage reductions.The Trades Union Commission decided in February to participate in thoNatioual Commission proposed by the Minister of Labour to inquire bito and fix for different trades a &quot; necessary salary,&quot; or the lowest wage on which workers could live under present conditions. It was hoped in this way to form a basis for the settlement of the Labour disputes Avhich were bound in time to follow the reduction of wages.
LUXEMBURG.Towards the middle of March the Trade Union Committee called off the strike in the foundries and metallurgical establishments in consequenco of the measures presumably the calling in of French troops taken by the authorities.The Government has now officially announced the suppression of the , Workmen&apos;s Councils in these establishments at Differdange, Dudolange, and Esch.  Thus is revoked the law passod last autumn establishing such councils.   Some disorders have followed attempts to bring workmen -into the idle fonudries under military protection.Communism and Socialism.Tho military authorities aro taking careful measure to prevent extremist publications from being sold or distributed at Army training centres in Belgium and amongst Belgian troops in occupied territory.The trades union officials are counteracting possible attempts by revolutionists to exploit the prevalent unemployment by sending to the industrial centres moderate speakers who advocate fidelity to trades union principles, and trust in the workers&apos; elected representatives.Liege extremists suffered a severe set-hack in the decision of the local Socialists by au overwhelming majority to continue their adherence to the Second International.Reports have been made to Moscow that Communist &quot; nests &quot; have boen successfully organised in Antwerp. The number of active workers reaches 172. These &quot;nests&quot; have been united with the Brussels centre.Allegations are being made that Belgian revolutionary elements enjoy a certain immunity from official interference owing to the fact that a Socialist Minister controls tho Department of Justice.It is reported that the &quot; Private Bill &quot; for the amnesty for political prisoners, recently introduced by Camille Iluysmrtus, is really intended by the Flemish Socialists to increase their adherents at the next general election. This scheme is not, however, likely to have any great success.The police raid in February on the office and private address of Joseph Jacquernotte did not give the desired result. Erroneous press reports were circulated speaking of the discovery of an intended inter-national communist outbreak. Such reports, in the opinion of the authorities, give extremists like Jacquemotte and Van Overstraeteu useful material for propaganda.In March the offices of &quot; L&apos;Exploite &quot; and of the secretary of the Belgian Communist Party were again raided by the police. Accounts, pamphlets, and correspondence were seized.Socialists and Women Voters.It appears that the principal parties will strive hard to win the women&apos;s vote in the Communal elections which take place on April 24th. The Socialist campaign has started with an appeal to tho women workers. The Socialists hope to profit in the industrial centres through tho prevalent trade depression and unemployment. In the agricultural districts most women may be expected to vote for the Catholic party.
ITALY.The Internal Situation.Tho chief difficulties at present facing the Government are not financial but internal, and arise from the bitter struggle between Fascisti and Communists. The policy of tho Government is to play off tho Fascisti against the Communists, who, since the split in the Socialist Party, are isolated. The Fascisti have not been slow to use aud abuse  the tacit consent to their activities. There is no doubt that tho receut riots at Florence and elsewhere were organised attempts by au alliance of Anarchists and Communists to sot up Soviet republics. At Florence paper currency was found marked &quot; Tuscan Republic&apos;,.&quot; These outbreaks of violence, though widespread, are local and not national, a fact which indicates failure to extend the revolutionary movement and to produce a national strike. On the whole, the public believes that the Communists have lost their power and that the Communist outrages are in reality indications of the waning strength of the party, who seek to show the country that they are still to ba reckoned with. They may desire also to show their Russian paymasters that they aro worthy of their hire. It would be foolish to deny that the situation is grave, but it must be remembered that the disorders are disgusting the people with the extremists.Tho Socialist leaders are raid to have no longer any illusions as to conditions in Russia. It is generally realised also that a successful revolution would entail the utter collapse of the Italian economic fabric. The Socialists are moving to &quot; Reformism&quot; aud to a preparation of the electorate by constitutional methods in preference to stirring up revolution.The troops and tho Guardie Regie are giving proof of excellent morale during the conflicts between Fascisti and Communists. Their sympathies are entirely with the Fascisti. - 500 Communists were arrested in the earlier part of March.One of the most serious riots that have yet occurred between Fascisti and Communists took place at Trieste at the end of February. Here, under the impression that Jugo-Slavia had occupied Longatico, and under the pretext that the Communists had killed one of theirs in Istira, the Fascisti burnt the Socialists&apos; meeting house and the Communist club. The general strike which followed was marked by the burning of the San Marco shipbuilding yard by the extremists in revenge. The Labour quarter of Trieste was occupied by troops with artillery.The most sensational outrage which has so far marked the disorders in Italy occurred on March 23rd, when a bomb was thrown in the interior of the Diana Theatre at Milan, killing 17 persons and wounding over 100. Attacks followed on the new offices of tho &quot; Avanti&quot; aud ou the offices of the anarchist newspaper &quot; [Jmanita Nova,&quot; as well as on Socialist offices and meeting places. Malatesta and his companions, who were on hunger strike, consented to take food after hearing of the outrage.The Communists.According to the &quot; Giornale cl&apos;Italia,&quot; which bases its information on Scandinavian statements, there are in Italy over 600 emissaries of Moscow, who are in constant touch with Italian Communists. The hand of those agents of Moscow, and especially their money, are apparent everywhere.
Tlie Italian Communist Party has its headquarters in Milan, using provisionally the headquarters of the Juvenile Socialist Association, which recently carried a motion for adherence to Communism by 12,400 votes against 12,000. -1.000 representatives, however, abstained from votiug. A Communist Federation has been formed of the sections  some 60 the majority of whose members adhere to the Communist Party. The official organ of the party is the &quot; Online Nliovo&quot; of Turin ; a bi-weekly Communist paper, &quot; II Communista,&quot; is also published in Milan, and attempts are being made to found a Communist organ in Koine.   &quot; Other funds &quot; will probably supply the money needed.Labour.The Congress of the Italian Confederation of Labour at Leghorn ended by leaving the Confederation in a curious position, midway between Amsterdam and Moscow and risking excommunication by both. By a majority of over 1,000,000 votes the Congress adopted a Socialist resolution favouring affiliation with Moscow on condition that Moscow recognises the Socialist Party, while a Communist resolution demanding immediate secession from Amsterdam obtained over 400,000 votes. The Confederation in fact joins tho Moscow International subject to the terms of its alliance with the Socialist Party, a body for which Moscow has little love, but at the same time remains attached to the Amsterdam International Federation of Trade Unions.A new Governmental decree, although it affirms the principle of tho -18 hours week, raises the daily hours of work on the State railways from 8 to 10. Some resistance appears likely the railway workers of Milan have declared that they will not abandon the eight hours system.The Government is inquiring into the latest railway strike in Tuscany, which affected 20,000 railway workers. The parties responsible are to be divided into three categories of provokers, propagandists, and promoters. The provokers will bo immediately suspended and handed over to the judicial authorities. Dismissal from the service on tho grounds of moral and material damage to the interests of the State will follow the magistrate^ sentence. Disciplinary measures, such as stoppage of pay and employment, will be used against promoters and propagandists.The Catholic International.lii connection witn the proposed Catholic International SignorTovini has given to a meeting of the National Council of the Italian Popular Party in Rome an account of his travels abroad and of his meetings with leading Catholic politicians. Apcrmaneut political understanding would, he thought, bo difficult, but an understanding among the Catholic parliamentary groups in the various countries might pave the way to it. The National Council eventually authorised the parliamentary groups to take the initiative in convening the iuter-parliamentary Catholic Conference.The Russian Mission.The Russian Soviet Mission, headed by Vorovsky, has arrived in Rome. Tho mission numbers 22 members. Its purposes and the contents of its baggage aroused great curiosity and a good deal of suspicion. It is singular that Moscow persistently delays giving permission to an Italian Mission to enter Russia. As regards the baggage the mission was permitted to introduce a diplomatic valise exempt from search. But 27 huge cases arrived, for which tho mission claimed immunity, declaring
that rather than have the eases opened, they would have them all sent back. The aid of the Socialist Deputies Avas invoked, and a scene occurred when the Customs authorities wished to open some of the cases. Meanwhile the Fascisti mounted a guard of 200 sworn men round the station where the trunks were stored, and the Government pacified the public by declaring that under no circumstances would the eases, which were suspected to contain gold, be delivered without Customs examination. The Customs authorities at length opened 12 of the packages in question, and found them to contain, besides personal belongings, a quantity of jewels, money, and other valuables. The luggage was finally restored to the delegation. Yorovsky has intimated that he believes that Count Sforza is trying to maintain and stabilise trade relations between the two countries, but ho hints that if opposition is not controlled events may force him to leave Home.It is reported that the Russian Soviet Government has sent Kuroyedov to Rome with detailed instructions regarding espionago and counter-espionage. Kuroyedov was a member of Vorovsky&apos;s staff in Sweden, and has been described as Strom&apos;s right-hand man in Consular work.Sinn Fein in Italy.Sinn Fein propaganda continues in the Italian press, but the results have not been very marked. The &quot;Tempo&quot; of Rome has attacked Cardinal Bourne&apos;s attitude, obviously on the inspiration of tho Irish College. There is a suggestion that this attack was written by Mon-signor Bonaiuti, an excommunicated cleric, with whom priests should have no contact. Outside the clerical press traces of Sinn Fein propa-ganda have appeared in &quot; La Testa di Ferro,&quot; (bo organ of tho ex-legionaries of Finnic, now published at Milan.The solf-styled envoy of Sinn Fein would appear to be not Thomas but Mr. John T. 0&apos;Kclly, who managed to make rather a stir in Rome, and to disgust the Vatican by his noisy activities. His function is to make himself conspicuous, his most practical aim to keep up subscription lists, principally in America. Father 0&apos;Flanagan, one of the ablest of the Sinn Fein lenders, has been suspended a divinis for disobedience to his bishop, and is not persona grata, in Rome. The Vatican is no doubt interested in the provisions of the Government of Ireland Bill dealing with religious questions. Rome has every facility for direct communica-tion with the Irish clergy.Patrick MaeSwecney would appear to bo expecting his reinstatement as Chamberlain of the Capo and Sword, an honour which, as he is prepared to pay for it, ho should have little difficulty in obtaining. On account of his previous deprivation ho was not on duty at the Vatican during the last Consistory. Gavan Duffy has arrived in Rome from Genoa.The leaders of the Catholic Party, Angelo Mauri and Pietro Borromeo, were the principal speakers at a meeting in favour of the Irish Republic, hold in Pome towards the middle of March under the auspices of the &quot; Circolo Universitario Cattolico Romano.&quot; Mauri&apos;s lengthy speech corresponded pretty closely with the contents of the propaganda pamphlets and the newspapers which were showered upon people entering the hall ; it was spiced with compbiints against England as a hard usurer, and succeeded in rousing much anti-English vociferation. Mauri stood out as tho Italian mouthpiece of Sinn Fein, as against Borromeo, whose speech was merely that of a professional politician. Outside the theatre there was some attempt at a pro-Irish demonstration,
of the kind that can easily he organised in Italy given the judicious expenditure of a little money.A story, to be received with caution, is afoot that, a cargo of rifles is being despatched to Ireland for the Sinn Feiners. DAnnunzio is said to be at the bottom of this gun-running affair, and to see himself tasting a new sensation by heading a, Sinn Fein revolt. A later report con-cerning his venture states that the cargo of rifles has been loaded on a vessel with a crew of Legionaries. 250,000 rifles with ammunition supplied by IVAuimnzio are on board. l)&apos;Annunzio himself is said to be at Hrescia, where he concluded the contract on March 8th or 9th with a Sinn Fein agent named Lane and an Irish consul named Maclialos.Miscellaneous.The Italian Chamber has refused to approve the Convention signed last year making over to Captain Giulietti&apos;s Communist shipping enter-prise, known as the Garibaldi, five ex-German steamers, estimated to be worth 30,000,000 lire, at the nominal price of (5,000,000 lire. This Genoa Communist undertaking is one of the disastrous experiments encouraged by the Nitti Government.The expulsion from Italy of Count Karolyi, his wife and his secretary, Alexander Fazekas, is officially announced to have been due to the Count&apos;s doubtful relations with Florentine and foreign Communists and to suspicions that he transmitted funds to revolutionary Italian elements. The connection of the Count with Communist activities will prepare the way for repressive measures against undesirable Hungarians, many of whom came to Italy after the downfall of liela Kun. This was, indeed, the ultimate object of Count Karolyi&apos;s expulsion.The Rome &quot;Tempo,&quot; one of tho most anti-British newspapers in Italy, has published au editorial note against Abdul Hamid Said Bey, who has been giving interviews about Tripoli to some of the provincial papers. It is pointed out that Abdul Hamid Said Bey represents the &quot;League of Oppressed Peoples,&quot; which itself represents elements hostile to France and England, and, therefore, his interests must be antagonistic to Italian interests. The note would seem to have been officially iuspiied by the Government.SPAIN.The Fight against Syndicalism.Active measures in repression of Syndicalism were reported early in the month to continue throughout Spain, and to be largely successful, in spite of the bitter resistance of the Syndicalists. Resistance was becoming more and more spasmodic and indirect, and labour had for the moment lost what little sympathy it, had with the general public.It was reported that, the comparative quiet of Barcelona might be followed by trouble in Valencia, either of Avhich places or Bilbao may now be the temporary headquarters of the Confederaeion. The Catalans are not greatly pleased with Moscow&apos;s notification of a boycott of Spanish goods as a counter-blast to repression. The business of organisation Moscow seems disinclined to undertake. Few practical results are likely ; one result may be the adhesion of the Syndicalists of Spain to the International Anarchist-Syndicalists of Berlin.Unemployment is spreading, but the actual causes are difficult to determine. The financial crisis in Catalonia is haviug some effect on the action of the Patronal in attempting to lower wages and in not working, but the expectation of a drop in the prices of raw material iso  as 8789 b
another factor. There is meanwhile much talk of sabotage and of designs on the liberty of the workers.Official methods of repression havo considerably changed the character of the Red groups. In the early days the members were thorough-going Syndicalists who were not above taking blood-money ; now they are composed of thieves and rascals of every description whose one idea is to get money. The Syndicalist Committees are still obtaining funds, since not only can they afford to pay higher prices for murder, but they are able to support their comrades in gaol. The present pursuit has also caused considerable confusion in the Syndicalist ranks ; there seems to be no very definite plan of defence against the Government. Some tendency is apparent to abandon revolutionary methods ill favour of parliamentary intervention.In the South of Spain the authorities are said to have unearthed an extremist organisation and the wholesale arrests that have followed have lodged all the chief syndicalist leaders in gsiol.Shooting continued meanwhile in Barcelona, where casualties were put approximately at between 20 and 30 per week. Reports suggest the possibility of street fighting before tho trouble ends. The light is really a triangular one, the authorities being the base which unofficially supports the Sindioato Libre and both aro fighting the Unico. In spite of these disorders the general situation is hopeful.At Zaragoza, as elsewhere, the authorities are getting the upper hand. In this town there has been difficulty on account of their fear of terrorism to get jurors to appear in criminal prosecutions. The difficulty was overcome by the swearing in of extra jurors.At Rio Tin to all the miners early in March announced their intention to return to work.An article in &quot;Espana Nueva,&quot; the organ in Madrid of the extreme Syndicalists, is significant. In this article Angel Pestana, the well-known agitator, expounds the futility of assassinating individual employers of labour. Spain is a country in which deeds mean more to the uneducated than words, and Pestaua&apos;s article may mean that the drastic methods of the Barcelona authorities are effective, if only in enforcing an appearance of order.Anarchists and the Army.Tho anarchists were reported in February to be taking advantage of.&quot; the recruiting of volunteers for the Army of Africa to introduce their own agents as propagandists. The Anarchist Federation is said to pay these men ten pesetas a day and 500 pesetas premium. In order to supervise the underlings, some of the leaders are joining. The Army authorities know of this matter, which, in the interests of maintaining public confidence in the army, is not likely to be openly divulged.German and Irish Press Campaign.The pro-Sinn Fein campaign continues in certain separatist organs. There is little doubt that the Sinn Feiners are in communication with the separatists in Catalonia and the Basque Provinces. Responsible Spanish newspapers have, however, generally abandoned the Sinn Fein cause,, since parallels between Sinn Fein and the Basque and Catalan movements can too easily be drawn.Foreigners, however, are not affected by such trifles. J. Gavan Duffy * who is called an emissary extraordinary of the Sinn Fein Republic and member of Parliament, gave an interveiw to the &quot; Debate&quot; early in March, in which he stated he had found comrades in other countries, but
brothers in Spain. He asserts that in Ireland the good fight is carried on by the Republican Army who, with an iron discipline, are actuated by a solemn faith in their ultimate success, against which the power of England is shattering itself.The German Embassy would appear to have abandoned its policy of direct subsidy of certain newspapers in favour of paying individual journalists to publish pro-German articles in various newspapers. The articles deal chiefly with the indemnity and commercial questions. Their tone is rather anti-French than anti-Ally as a whole, though England is frequently pointed out as the real gainer by tho indemnity terms. There is an improvement in tho tone of tho &quot; Sol,&quot; which was in tho habit of publishing occasional jaundiced articles on the Irish question. German commercial men in Madrid have held a meeting to protest against tho 12 per cent, export duty. They argued that Spain and Spanish trade will suffer, but do not appear to have gained much success.Vigdor Kopp is reported to have sent to Spain one Shigarovitch, well supplied with funds and propaganda.portugal.Early in March the Government of Dr. Bernadino Machado, with its four ex-Premiers, came into oflice with prospects of lasting a little longer than tho ephemeral Governments of recent days. More than most countries, Portugal needs stability and appeasement. The financial situation is so acute that famine and bankruptcy threaten,The Lisbon newspaper strike ended at the beginning of March, after lasting six weeks. At Oporto a general strike of 24 hours, apparently engineered by the Syndicalists, was called as a protest against tho dear-ness of living. Nervousness on the part of the police led to trouble in the streets. Some Syndicalist disturbances, in the course of which bombs were exploded, doing considerable damage, occurred, but were quickly suppressed.The &quot; Batalha &quot; appears to be engaged on anti-British propaganda, for which the Irish question gives it pabulum. The subsidises of tho &quot; Batalha &quot; may consider this propaganda insurance of future goodwill from the &quot; Batalha&quot; in a possible eventuality.Many former emigrants to the United States of America are returning to Portugal destitute, and conditions in Brazil are not good. Emigration to Brazil is restricted by the friction with Portugal, which objects to the harsh Brazilian treatment of immigrants. Here a Mulatto element seems to be trying to revenge itself on a comparatively white element. Prices in Portugal are falling. A stable Government and tho return of many good labourers might yet bring Portugal to its natural destiny as an agricultural paradise.2. scandinavian countries. norway.Communism and Socialism.At its Extraordinary National Conference, Norwegian labour will bo faced with deciding whether or not the Moscow programme should bo accepted or slightly changed. A minority, led by Ole C. Lian, objects to the Moscow programme, but nevertheless favours the Soviet system and the dictatorship of the proletariat. A further split of the Labour Party 0 AS 8789 0
is very unlikely--Norwegian labour is Communist and wants to prepare revolution. Red plans to fire the big Norwegian railway stations are denied for the present.Otto Winter-lljelm, Junr., at Christiania is said to have been corn-missioned to found the Norwegian section of the Communist &quot; Federation of Intellectual Workers of the World.&quot;&quot; Akerhus Socialdemokrat&quot; has published a request to the sections affiliated with the Third International to do their utmost to convert working women to Communism. The scheme provides for a national propaganda committee, local secretariats, and the affiliation with and control by their national parly of the women&apos;s sections.The first number of &quot; Tidens Tanker,&quot; edited by Olaf Kringen for the new Norwegian Social Democratic Party, set forth the theoretical views of tho party on policy and social reform. A manifesto, signed by the parliamentary group of the new party, strongly condemned violent revolution and civil war, and advocated parliamentary methods of class warfare.Relations with Russia.The Foreign Secretary has announced in the Storthing that Norway would not recognise the Soviot Government, but would not prevent private firms from trading with Russia.The Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association have settled their conflict with the Sailors&apos; Union, the mon&apos;s hinders having agreed to take no part in smuggli&apos; g Bolshevik literature into the country.Norway has so far obtained from the Russian Soviet Government no settlement of tho expenses incurred by a Norwegian expedition to the Kara Sea last year to rescue a Russian ice-breaker. The expenses amount to 3,300,000 kroner, and the Soviet has not even replied t) telegrams asking for payment.Norwegian military experts are reported to be taking secret defensive measures against the possibility of an attack by Russia.Trade with Russia.The Norwegian Government, while willing to resume trade relations with Soviet Russia, desires to conduct these negotiations in London, where its representatives.will be in immediate touch with the progress of the London negotiations. Krassin has been, urging the Soviet Govern-ment to resume negotiations on the usual conditions of admission of representatives, immunity, moratorium, &amp;c. That they should be resumed in London does not suit him quite so well, and he will probably propose that negotiations shall be carried on in Scandinavia.SWEDEN.The Economic Situation.There is reported to be a superficial calm among the working classes ; a storm may, however, be brewing. Beneath the surface is unrest brought about by the bad economic conditions, the growing unemployment, the prospect of wage reductions, and the very difficult economic future. The Bolsheviks are encouraging this unrest, and there may be serious demon-strations in the near future, though on the whole communism does not seem to prosper. It is to bo specially noted that this spirit of lawlessness appears to have attacked the military.The authorities are spending 1,250,000 kroner on finding work for the Stockholm unemployed.   An additional 400,000, which must soon be
augmented, has been voted for support for the unemployed.   Strikers will receive no financial assistance.The Left Socialists were beaten by the Social Democrats at the annual election of the committee of the Stockholm Metal Workers Trade Unions, and lost all the official positions which they gained a year ago. The Left Socialists had been conducting Bolshevik propaganda in the trade unions.Russian Gold.Reports from different sources put the amount ofj gold from Russia deposited with the Nordiska Ilandolshanken in Stockholm at 50,000,000 kroner, or as high as 180,000,000 kroner. Though there is an official ban on the export of gold from Sweden, a licence is obtainable without undue difficulty. Tho banks are said to distrust the many inquiries regarding the export of gold front Sweden which come from America.Trade with Russia.Public opinion generally would appear to favour the resumption of trade with Russia, and tho Government is not discouraging this attitude. A delegation representing &quot;Exportforingen&quot; has, after long delays, obtained visas for Russia.to examine conditions and probably to negotiate there on behalf of its clients.Nydquist and Holm are reported to bo working hard on the order of locomotives for the Bolsheviks. 1,000 workers are at present employed on this order, more will bo engaged when material increases.The Bolsheviks have purchased two steamers in Sweden for 2,500,000 Swedish kroner, which are to sail under the Soviet flag.During his stay in Stockholm Vanderlip conferred secretly with Lomonosov and Kerjontzcv regarding the starting of negotiations between Russia and tho United Kingdom. Otherwise he kept his presence iu Sweden almost secret.Miscellaneous.A pleasant little mystery has arisen round tho disappearance of 4^ millions collected for Swedish metal workers suffering from the lock-out last spring by the AU-Russian Union of Metal Workers. It appears that the funds were not handed over. &quot; Social Domokraton &quot; has raised the question of what has become of them and bints that they stuck or molted away somewhere in Russia.On arriving in Stockholm during February, Martens, lately Soviet emissary in the U.S.A., made some difficulties about transhipment, apparently because he wished to confer with Lonionsoff, and with Swedish representatives of the Soviet. The Swedish Government had actually provided facilities for Martens to meet Lomonosoff; ho also conferred with Hellberg. &quot; Politikon&quot; attempted to make trouble over the Governments attitude to Martens.Swedish shipbuilders are reported to be much perturbed by tho action of Hugo Stinnes in buying up many of the shares in Oresundsvarvet, the big Swedish shipbuilding yard. Tho presumption is that this yard will be used for restoring the German mercantile marine, and its com-competitors fear undercutting.DENMARK.Early in the month a Trade Union quarrel with the Danish Em-ployers&apos;Association brought about a lock-out of 75,000 workpeople in  i
the textile and shoemaking industries. The Board of Danish Co-opera-tive Trade Unions has called out nearly 200,000 workers in the iron, metal industry, textile works, shoe factories, brick factories, and saw mills controlled by the Employers&apos; Association.The Industrial Council of Trades Unions later sent out the second strike notice to the Employers&apos; Association, to take effect on March 29rh. All workers employed by members of the Employers&apos; Association are affected.3. central european countries.HOLLAND. The Anti-Militarist Conference.It was thought probable that most of the European Communist groups would be represented at tho &quot;International Anti-militarist Congress&quot; which, as previously mentioned, was to bo held at the Hague towards ibo end of March. Tho congress was credited with the intention of creating a species of anti-militarist International, charged with propaganda in the various armies, and among the young people of Europe, and with devising an organisation for stopping wars by revolutionary methods.Troelstra is thought to have .heen responsible for tho idea of assembling the congress ; one Joseph Giesen of tho Hague was the principal organiser. Information tends to show that the German authorities intended to exploit the congress. Certain German delegates, believed to be acting in touch with the German authorities, have been trying to get in touch with French and other delegates in order to decide upon a common plan of action at tho congress. One of the German delegates is a German journalist living at Geneva, who has long been in political relationship with the German authorities.Communism in the Dutch East Indies.A vernacular newspaper reports a congress of tho &quot; Perserikatan Kommunis Internationale &quot; (Communist Party of the Netherlands East Indies) held at Samarang on December 24th last. Semaoen presided ; Bergsma, Baars and Stain were present, as well, it is said, as 1,500 more persons. Semaoeu explained that the &quot; Perserikatan Kommunis Inter-uationale &quot; was a small, but very influential body. According to him, it seeks not so much to increase its own membership as to work upon other bodies in order to sow the seeds of Communism. Stam was elected to represent the &quot; Perserikatan Kommunis Internationale &quot; in the Volksraad ; association with the Third International was discussed in camera. Hostility was shown towards the native revolutionary movement, Sarikat Islam, which was described as dangerous to Commuuism. The Union of Railway Workers has repudiated Sarikat Islam, but has refused affiliation with the International; the Union of Workers on sugar estates has protested against Communist predominance in the Vak Centrale (the revolutionary Central Workers&apos; Union).Miscellaneous.The secret courier service between Holland and Soviet Russia is reported either to have broken down or to be very uncertain.In conjunction with the &quot; Zaaier&quot; and the &quot;Free Youths&apos; Union&quot; the committee of the Syndicalist Youths&apos; organization in Holland is starting a campaign to frustrate the law for compulsory physical culture, which they allege is intended for military purposes.
A certain Arend De Boo, living at Rotterdam, is reported to be developing a scheme for publishing a free journal in English to be called &quot; Guide for tho Netherlands and Colonies.&quot; His profession of pro-English feeling has been suspiciously blatant. Acting as Do Boo&apos;s interpreter and, in fact, in sole charge of the new venture is Autonius Fr. J. Koch, during the war a very active German agent.GERMANY.The Communist Outbreaks.Early in February there woro rumours that Kopp was preparing a &quot;putsch&quot; to combine with a general strike in Central Germany in the spring. While it is difficult to fix precisely tho responsibility for the series of Communist explosions which occurred in Germany, principally in tho centre of the country, round about Easter, it is clear that they did not arise from auy spontaneous revolutionary spirit. The inference is that they were ordered by the Bolsheviks for the purposes of their own internal propaganda. Holz, the Communist leader, is known to have acted as a Monarchist agent in the troubles which succeeded the Kapp Putsch iii March of last year.Tho trouble began with robbery and lawlessness in Halle, the Communist stronghold ; bomb outrages, rioting, destruction of railway bridges, and proclamation of local Soviets followed in various districts, and the measures of repression taken involved not inconsiderable blood-shed. At Hamburg there was a short-lived seizure of the Blohm and Voss shipyard. Berlin itself was not greatly disturbed, The trouble spread later to the industrial Rhinelaud and to Westphalia. There was trouble in Dortmund and Essen, and the railways between Elberfeld and Cologne and Elberfeld and dusseldorf were seized by the rebels. On March 29th the Government troops surrounded tho Communist head-quarters in the nitrogen works at Leuna, near Halle, forced a surrender, and captured 1,000 insurgents and largo supplies of arms and ammuni-tion. The severity of measures of repression has increased with the return of authority. The Sicherheitspolizci seem to have marched into action with howitzers, mine-throwers, and other weapons forbidden by the Peace Treaty. The explanation is that these arms were borrowed from the Reichswehr.The Communists and Moscow.The allegation is made that the real reason for the resignations of Levi, Klara Zetkin, and other Communist leaders referred to at length in our issue of February 1921 was that Moscow considered that the Central Committee was not sufficiently strong and energetic, and that the interests of the Communist Revolution were being neglected. A manifesto minimising the whole matter has since been issued by the Central Committee. One rumour views the resignation of Klara Zetkiu as made out of personal feeling for Levi; another as a scheme to facilitate his return. In part, at least, the affair appears to have arisen out of the Party&apos;s stand against Moscow on the Italian split, and its recording its. regret that the split had occurred, thinking a combination of the Italian Communist Party with Serrati was feasible.Brandler and Stoeckor have succeeded as leaders Dr. Levi and the other dissident members of the United Communist Party Executive. There have latterly been party intrigues against Dr. Levi, prominent in which have been two little-known individuals named Friesland and Ruth Fischer.   Neither Brandler, who is nothing but a theorist, nor
Stoecker, who is an assertive young journalist, can compare in ability and influence with their predecessors.The departure of Paid Levi and his friends from the Executive Board of the German Communist Party caused great interest at the Pink International in Vienna. Crispien saw in the crisis a sign that the reasonable members of (lie Party could no longer blindly obey Moscow. The fact that the Muscovite tool, Stoecker, now headed the Party Avas a sign that there was no longer room there for thinking members. Crispien foresaw possible complete disruption. There was a tendency on the other hand to minimise the affair as a domestic squabble.Tho Russian Section of the German Communist Party is working among the Russian colony in Berlin, if not to transfer sympathies to the Bolsheviks, at least to prevent active hostility against the Soviet regime. Agitation among tho prisoners of war is another of its concerns. This agitation is to be conducted by the creation of Communist &quot; nests,&quot; the sending of lecturers and agitators, and tho distribution of Bolshevik literature.Communism.Late in February the internal political situation was reported to be more strained. The activity of tho United Communist Party, in which tho extremists have united, was becoming sensible. In tho Ruhr district the movement was tending to support the movement of the railwayinen who had not yet renounced their claims. In Central Germany the extremist leaders Avore transforming tho economic movement into a political movement. A general strike, at least in Northorn and Western Germany, was being worked for, while in Bavaria efforts Avcre being made to revolutionise the Roichswehr.The German Communists wore reported about the same date lately to have had pressed upon them by tho Soviet Government the necessity of speedy direct action in connection Avith an advance pending from Russia. The Soviet had, however, beon informed that present coiulitions did not favour an outbreak, and that preparation Avas still needed. Preparation consisted in propaganda and the formation of &quot; Kampftruppen &quot; charged with sabotage, and the hindering of Avilling workers from work. The Red Army had been divided into regular troops, to do purely military work, and &quot; Wildetruppe,&quot; to act as leaders in pillage and terror. Tho majority of the younger Avorkers in tho Ruhr are said to have Communist tendencies, but the older men, especially former soldiers, keep aloof and even oppose Red agitators.The Ruhr district seems indeed to be a hot-bed of revolutionary and advanced ideas. Shop organisation and productive capacity iare alike affected by the social revolution through Avhich the iron industry is passing.The Communists Avere a good deal disturbed by the confiscation; early in March of a store of arms in Stendahl. This Avas the second biggest Communist store, and was to have supplied Magdeburg, BrunsAvick, as well as Stendahl. F. II. Shacht, a comparatively recent arrival from Russia, where he Avas President of the German Soviet, had much to do with the organisation of this store.Communist loaders in Upper Silesia are reported to have disregarded tho instructions issued by the leaders of tho Workmen&apos;s Communist Party to vote neither for Gormany nor for Poland, but for a Soviet Republic, and to have ordered their members to abstain from voting. The Independent Socialists advised their adherents to vote for Gormany, apparently as being a country further on the path of tho world revolution than Poland.
Relations with Russia.The Soviet Delegation in Berlin, during Victor Kopp&apos;s absence in Moscow, was at a considerable disadvantage owing to the lack of formal powers of attorney made out to it by the Russian Commissariat for Foreign Trade. The power of attorney was probably withheld because of tho distrust of Kopp in Moscow. The situation of the Soviet Delegation was that it had no legal status, aud that its transactions had no validity.Moscow had then urged Kopp somewhat peremptorily to greater efforts in recruitiug Germans for the Red Army. &quot;Most serious atton-&quot; tion must be paid to the recruiting of a far larger number of volunteers &quot; and to employ all means so that they may be sent to Russia as quickly &quot; as possible.&quot; It is emphasised that only men politically mature, not undesirables, should be sent. The route via Lithuania is mentioned as preferable to the sea route, though both should bo used. At present there are only 8,000 Red recruits, a number totally inadequate. All Red soldiers of German origin were being concentrated into separate German formations, which should yield -10,000 men (?).It cannot be established definitely whether Kopp received 110,000,000 marks from Krassin, but il is known that the Soviet Delegation was expecting the arrival of 90,000,000 marks about the time when Krassin was in Berlin,V. Stankevitch, one of the hopes of Moscow, heads the organisation called &quot;MiryTrud&quot; (&quot;Peace and Work &quot;), which was created when the Soviet Government was trying to renew diplomatic aud trade relations with the West, and which has for task to form a public opinion favourable to the Bolsheviks, and to force neutral elements to a change of their anti-Bolshevik tactics. Stankevitch is pledged to compel public opinion to pronounce against intervention. The Bolsheviks subsidise the Russian daily &quot;Golos Rossii &quot; (The Voice of Russia), published in Berlin and edited by one Goldberg, who, with the help of Staukevitch, has organised in his flat a series of agitation courses.A new Soviet delegate, Dr. Aichenwald, has arrived in Germany. He is a scientist, who works in great secret, and is not mixed up in politics.According to a report from The Hague, a Russian Bolshevik named Loutovinof has arrived in Berlin, charged by Moscow with negotiating with the Communists and Nationalists of Bavaria a military treaty against the Entente.The Russian Right groups in Germany are reported to have com-bined to form a political centre in Berlin called &quot;The Great Russian National Centre.&quot; This centre will co-ordinate the activities of all Russian elements, except those of the Social Revolutionaries. It is in contact with Russian emigrants and with the remnants of semenoff&apos;s and WraugePs forces, though it has no direct communication with Wrangel. Close connection exists with the German Right Groups. The Centre does no open work as yet, and functions under the cover of the Great Russian Political Committee.Trade Agreement with Russia.The conclusion of a commercial agreement between Germany and Russia is semi-officially announced. It provides for tho continuance of the present representative commissions in Germany and Russia, to which are to be attached special representatives for trade, allowed diplomatic immunity and free use of wireless and telegraph services. The protec-tion of nationals is to be the business of the present commission.   The
agreement provides that the German trade representative in Russia shall take over the economic interests of Germany in Russia and register all agreements made by Germans in Russian territory. The properties in Russia of Germans who have proceeded thither on affairs covered by the agreement are to be inviolable.Tho provisional protocol was signed as long ago as February 18th, so that the agreement appears to have been kept secret till that between Great Britain and Russia had been signed. Thus, too, may be explained M. Krassin&apos;s declaration on passing through Berlin that ho was going to London with definite orders to sign. Tho agreement is reportod to havo boen arrived at under cover of negotiations for the mutual exchange of prisoners. Signs of German complaisance towards Russia have been evident of late.One Balk, an intermediary at Kopp&apos;s Commercial Bureau, is responsible for the statement that the Germans are offering goods to tho Soviot at very low prices but in small quantities. The Bolsheviks want underwear and 20,000 pairs of cavalry boots. Zoiss glasses aro too expensive for tho Soviet, but negotiations for them aro still progressing. Carl Reimers is reported to be Bolshevik representative in Stettin for tho export of goods. The firm of Sack, of Leipzig, is said to havo exported recently 20,000 ploughs to Russia, payment for which was made in gold without alloy before the despatch of tho consignment.The shipping and transport firm of lutrasko, Franzosische Strasse 49, Berlin, is said to bo tho medium through which the Soviet Delegation exports forbidden goods from Germany to Russia. Goods aro sent via Danzig or Stettin on an undertaking that they will not bo sent beyond these places. However, by an understanding with tho local authorities, tho goods aro transhipped to Roval for Russia. Picric acid is going to Russia in this way.Orgesch and Einwohnerwehr.At a meeting of the Federal and State Ministers held during February the disarmament of the Selbstschutz organisations was discussed. The general opinion was that it was impossible to oppose this any longer. Such an attitude would find no sympathy abroad nor any unanimous support from the German people. The only opposition came from Bavaria, whose &quot; Ministerprasideut&quot; argued that the Selbstschutz organisation of tho Einwohnerwehr was necessary, and that neither by fair means nor foul would Bavaria allow herself to bo deprived of this means of self-defence. This intransigent attitude evoked general opposition. Federal Minister Fehrenbach went so far as to say that owing to the events which took place during the Soviet regime, Bavaria was much more securely safeguarded from the Communist menace than other States. Nor would anyone believe that Bavaria was menaced by any danger from foreign politics.Meanwhile there aro indications that Bavaria may become (with what compensations is uuknowu) more accommodating in the Einwohnerwehr question. The Premier has stated that although the Bavarian Govern-ment are still of opinion that the time is not ripe for the abolition of tho Einwohuerwehr, a compromise with the Imperial Government is imminent, since the interests of tho Empire should precede tho interests of any particular State. Possibly tho understanding come to is such that he finds it gracious to concede.A circular issued in Hamburg, after deploring the disbandment of tho Einwohnerwehr who looked after the Hoheluft quarter of tho city, intimates that a number of tho men have united to form a new &quot; Heimschutz.&quot;   An appeal is made for recruits.
Hugo Stinnes.According to the &quot; Munohoner Zcitung,&quot; Krhardt, who was from-nently connected with the Kapp Putsch, recently offered to Hugo Stinnes to overthrow the Government in the. event of tho failuro of the London Conference, and suggested his own appointment as dictator. Stinnes called the plan crazy and rejected it on the spot. LudendorfF is alleged to have been quite as unsympathetic. Erhardt had no succoss with the leaders of tho German People&apos;s Parly. Tin; Roichswehr has had no part in this scheme of Erhardt, whose following is only about 1,000.The limited liability company which has boon registered under tho title of the &quot;Products Corporation, Ltd.,&quot; with offices at 21, Holboru, London, is thought to have been formed to act as agent for Hugo Stinnes in the United Kingdom, and in certain places abroad. Its policy appears to intend the deflection of trade from Great Britain to Germany by setting British goods in foreign markets side by side with similar German goods, and pointing out the discrepancy in price. Tho new Company should considerably extend its connection in British colonies if it succeeds in its effort to take over the British firm of W. Bolus and Company.Miscellaneous.Returning from the Vienna International, tho German and foreign delegates halted at Munich, and addressed demonstrations organised by the Independent Socialists. Messrs. Ben Riley and Sbinwcll, of the Independent Labour Party, delivered pro-German speeches, and declared that they and their comrades would continue with renewed energy their party&apos;s struggle against Imperialism and the Paris decisions. The French representatives declaimed in similar style.The Reichsbank is reported to consider that the present value of the mark does not correspond with its real value. Its real value may be placed at 20 per cent., not at one-third of its nominal value, as Mr. Lloyd George estimated it. The intention of the Reichsbank to cause a steady rise in the value of the mark is being much hindered by private and interested obstruction.Krupp&apos;s works, which employed 78,118 men on July 1st, 1914, employed 89,226 on July 1st, 1920. 5,000 employees are now employed in the manufacture of locomotives and wagons. It is hoped to produce annually 800 heavy locomotives for goods trains and tenders and 2,500 wagons to carry 15 tons.The Reichswehr is to have control of those public dangers and hotbeds of Communism, the Russian prisoners of war internment camps. Ther power for evil may thus be somewhat diminished.Report has it that Dr. von Kahr is falling more and more under the influence of tho German Nationalist Party, which is Unitarian, while theDresden is ttie headquarters of the Saxon branch of the Orgesoh, of which the political department is under the former Geheimrat, Dr. Heinke, and the military department under Hofrat Eidam. The organisation is armed, has complete mobilisation plans, and is supported financially by hig industrial concerns. In close touch with the Saxon Orgesch is the &quot; Freie Burgorvereinigung&quot; in Czoeho-Slovakia, with 100,000 members.As an organisation to fight the Orgosch danger, the &quot; Peace Union of Participants in the War &quot; has founded an association to be called the &quot; Republikaniseher Beiehsbiind.&quot; Members of all parties from the Socialists to the Right will be accepted as members.
Bavarian Monarchist Party, with which von Kahr lias acute differences, is fundamentally Federalist.Following the refusal of the administration to increase wages by 10 marks a day, Hamburg dockers came out on strike.SWITZERLAND.The Swiss Socialist Party is reported to have been greatly disturbed by the recent voles on the subjects of adhesion to the Third International and the suppression of the Military Tribunals. The vote on the Third International has proved that the Communists do not amount to a quarter of the Swiss Socialist Party and the vote on the suppression of the Military Tribunals indicates a steady loss of influence by the Socialist Party, a loss especially marked in places where political struggles have, until now, been most violent. In certain places this loss of strength amounts to as much as 30 per contribute. of the Socialist effectives and it is not to be explained by saying that the extremists abstained from voting. Labour circles appear to expect serious political agitation in the near future and a revolutionary and socialist attempt may possibly occur during the spring. Should this be the case the upheaval will conform to an international plan. The leaders of the Swiss revolutionary movement do not disregard the difficulty of their task and not one Communist leader believes that the immediate prospects of the party are favourable. They are hoping, however, that the economic crisis may engender a general revolutionary spirit. A careful programme of action has been prepared for use when the moment comes, but the vast majority of the workers are not inclined to follow it. It may, however, be concluded that a general strike is almost certain to fail, and a revolutionary movc-ment to be instantly suppressed.The extreme Socialists, following German and Austrian example, have decided to unite with the Swiss Communist Party, and to form a now party, the &quot; United Communist Party of Switzerland&quot; (Vereinigte Kommuuistische Partei der Sohweiz V.K.P.S.) parallel to the United Communist Parties of Germany and Austria. The fusion took place at Zurich early in March. It was agreed that only members of the Trades Unions could be admitted into (he party as members, so that an active agitation will be made in the unions. One speaker advised that the greatest propaganda should be made among the peasants, who must be convinced that the workmen^ lot was theirs. Piatten, Schneider and Belmont, the three Communist members of the Federal Chamber, have announced their adhesion to the Swiss Communist Party. Flatten will probably lead them on his release from gaol. The organ of this new party will be &quot; L&apos;Avant-Garde,&quot; a paper to be published in Geneva under the editorship of Humbert-Droz. Simultaneously the Communist members of the &quot; Grosser Rat&quot; of Basle have formed themselves into a &quot;Communist Faction.&quot; The Swiss Communist Party has thus shed its weaker element, and means to be mobilised before its Russian colleagues make their offensive.The official split in the Geneva Socialist Party, after the national referendum had given a majority, in the canton of Geneva, to the opponents of Moscow, has resulted in tho formation of two Socialist parties at Geneva. The Socialist Party has about 2,000 members, mostly officials and moderate workmen ; another 2,000 workmen, not regular members, support it. The Communist Party numbers about 600 extremists, most of them foreign anarchists and deserters.
The States Council has rejected an initiative which aimed at obliging the Federal Council to arrest any anarchists of Swiss nationality who try to endanger the external and internal security of the country. It was stated that a draft revision of the Federal penal code to meet such cases had been prepared by the Department of Justice, and that the Swiss people should know the nature of the new law before beiug asked to pronounce themselves on the initiative,All classes of public opinion in Switzerland, including pro-Allied, are reported to have been badly impressed by the signing of the trade agreement between Great Britain and Russia. The Swiss would appear to see a betrayal of European civilisation, a prolongation of Soviet rule and an extension of its maleficent influence in Europe. Swiss investors in Russian securities say that the only security for the possible repayment of their debts disappears. The Swiss anti-Bolshevik authorities arc much concerned.AUSTRIA. Communism and the Wehrmacht.There exists within the Austrian Wehrmacht, as chief representatives of Socialism and Communism, a body of about 1,000 so-called Soldiers&apos; Councillors, of whom some two-fifths work as soldiers&apos; representatives within the Workmeu&apos;s Councils. The Soldiers&apos; Councillors may be said to stand beside the Corps of Officers as a second corps, half military and half political, under no control, acknowledging no orders or military law, and responsible only to the rank and file of the Wehrmacht, their electors. Strong in the support of their comrades they have no fear of opposition to their political or economic demands. These Soldiers&apos; Councillors have consistently refused to perform military duties, and have abused their many privileges for purposes of political activity.At the end of 1920 this activity took the form of a separate school for Soldiers&apos; Councillors. Here the pupils, exclusively Socialists and Communists, are trained to become &quot; spiritual&quot; as well its military leaders in the Wehrmacht. Soldiers&apos; Councillors are expected to train the troops in street fighting with a view to their employment in a revolutionary crisis.The Central Soldiers&apos; Council has gone as far as to ask the council to submit names of possible officers for every post in tho Wehrmacht. Nominal rolls of Socialist officers, with a view to their special promotion, were asked for at the same time. An army order that Soldiers&apos; Coun-cillors were no longer to share in the control of arms depots was not enforced in view of the strong opposition of the councillors.Tho Military Union (&quot; Militiirverband dcr Republik Ocstcrreich &quot;) is a trade union which makes of the Wehrmacht an armed Trades Union, courted by the Social Democrats and the Communist Soldiers&apos; Councillors. The Soldiers&apos; Councils forced the members of the Wehrmacht to join the union, under pain of dismissal from the force. Their monthly contribu-tion is deducted from their pay. Every barracks is a unit and every garrison a group of the Military Union.It is considered that the systematic arming of the Arbeiterwehren is proof of an intention to be later put into practice on the part of the Socialists to seize power. The Arbeiterwehr generally is well organised on a system adapted to local conditions. It is well armed, notably in the industrial centres on the Southern railway line and in the districts of Wieaer-Neustadt. In Vienna the workmon&apos;s and industrial councils, including the Communists, have undertaken the organisation of the
Arbeiterwehren, known later as &quot; Ordnertruppen.&quot; These are in close touch with the Soldiers&apos; Councils.Communism and Socialism.Communist activity continues, but the result is not commensurate with the amount of propaganda. The Social Democrats would appear to be having very much the better of the struggle. The Communists are reported to be intending a great increase of literary propaganda, the severance of connections with the Social Democrat parties, and a more hostile propaganda campaign.The Communist party is working industriously, but has no special plans for the immediate future. Action is now being concentrated against the Social Democrats and on work within Trades Unions, Councils, &amp;c. There is some diminution of Communist agitation in the Wehrmacht. Dr. Frey is, however, elaborating Soldiers&apos; Councils as a basis for the &quot; Red Army of Soviet Austria.&quot; Promises of promotion and pecuniary advantages aro being used to tempt individual officers.In the Tyrol tho Communist movement advances very slowly. The Wehrmacht hero is far less Radical than in other parts of Austria, though tho Soldiers&apos; Councils maintain strict authority. One-third of the Wohrmacht belong to tho Wohrbund, a counter-Trades Union Society which stands side by side with the gendarmerie. In tho Salzburg district Communist activities are increasing. Here the Arbeiterwehren are well organised and in touch with the Wehrmamt.The Recent Pink International.At the mooting of the &quot;Pink&quot; International in February, Adler declared that they knew from bitter experience of their own that in present circumstances there could bo no immediate victory of the proletariat in Western Europe. Tho revolution could only succeed when it had been carried through in the victorious countries, and iu the industrial countries.   It was not coming at tho speed Moscow expected.Before it closed, the Pink International adopted as its official title &quot;The Working Union of Socialist Parties.&quot; Tho British delegates appear to havo objected to the views put forward on class warfare. Bronsky, the emissary of the Soviet in Vienna, appeared and officially denied that tho Moscow Government had interfered in the affairs of Georgia. Tho Conference, however, remained sceptical, and declared that if the report of Russian intervention in Georgia Avas confirmed, this act must be judged bitterly by the whole European proletariat.The Executive Committee of the Working Union of Socialist Parties has elected an &quot; office&quot; of five persons. The members are Adler (Vienna), Grimm (Berne), Ledebour (Berlin), Longuet (Paris) and Wallhead (Manchester).   Adler is secretary.Miscellaneous.The leader of the Oriental movement in Vienna is Dr. Johann Schmeisser, librarian of the Oriental Section of the Vienna University, who combines knowledge of the East, Prussianism, hatred of England, and extreme energy. He is now stirring the listless Egyptian students by having them instructed in bomb-making, &amp;c, by a German officer ; and is seeking to enlist Bolshevik aid. Dr. Schmeisser&apos;s assistant is a fanatical Indian Mohammedan, who tries to iuduce Indian students to go to Vienna, so that they may profit by Dr. Schmeisser and his German military friends.The disconsolate and much hunted Trehitsch Lincoln is reported now to be seeking tho help and protection of Sir T. Cunningham.  He wants
Sir T. Cunningham to get articles against Czecho-Slovakia published for him in the London press, especially in the &quot; Daily News.&quot; The Czecho-Slovak Foreign Minister in finding him out has, pace Lincoln, been guilty of foul ingratitude.Failing to get satisfactory accommodation in Moscow, the Austrian Mission there has suggested the removal of the Soviet Mission in Austria to premises fitteJ up like the Moscow premises.Delegates of the non-Jewish Unions of Austria, Hungary, and Germany are to meet in Vienna, and define a common line of policy against Jewish influence in public life.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA. Action against the Communists.The country is passing through a grave economic crisis, and un-omployuvmt is general in certain districts. Employers have been forced to discharge many workers, an action resented by the men, and in some cases followed by a Communist seizure of factories. The CommunUt party (German section) is specially strong in Northern Bohemia, one of the most important industrial districts, but its activities are impeded by the Syndicalists, with whom the Government appears to have allied itself against the Communists. Fourteen Communists, chief among them Alois Muna, are now standing their trial for having, in December 1920, prepared the ground for revolution more briefly, for high treason. The accused maintain that no specific offenco is urged against them, and that the accusation is based on the hypothetical consequences of their socialist convictions. Certain of the accused, Muna, Anton Zapotocky, and others, are alleged to have published revolutionary articles, and to have made journeys to Moscow. Jaroslaw Handlik is said to have become a delegate of Moscow ; Bretislaw Hula to have had close relations with the Soviet Government. It is alleged that last September a revolutionary tribunal was formed at Kladno of which the principal members were Muna, Zapotocky, Naprstek, and Herynk. Mima is said to have made a revolutionary speech to the committee. Specific charges follow of occupation of and damage to* property during the December insurrection.Hopes of Revolution.Hillerson, the Soviet representative, has been expressing the hope to the Soviet Government of the possibility of a revolutionary movement in Czecho-Slovakia. A resolution was adopted at a conference of the Communist branch in the Prague district, believed by Hillerson to be one of the most Opportunist in the country, to the effect that arguments tending to invalidate the experience of the Russian revolution as formu-lated by the Third international are a pretext on the part of individuals to safeguard their own peace and security. The conference therefore considered it its duty to withstand attempts to break up the revolutionary labour movement. As regards the lock-out in the building trade, several thousand workers, in an ugly temper, Hillerson states, sent a deputation to tho Government with a demand for energetic measures against the owners. Outhe Premier promising to take steps to bring about an agreement between the owners and workers, the workers decided to continue the strike until their claims were satisfied.Hillerson, at Prague, sent a lachrymose note to Benes on March 3rd that if the Czech Government permitted the furnishing of military material to nations at war with Russia, i,e., to Poland, the Russian
Government would consider such action as an infringement of the neutrality proclaimed by Czecho-Slovakia. Hillersou expressed the profound disappointment of the Soviet Government at such instances occurring on the eve of the restoration of normal relations and an inter-change of missions.The Troubles of Dr. Hillerson.The activities of the Hillerson Mission steadily diminish, and the members have little to do but amuse themselves. Dr. Hillerson was to have gone as Ambassador to Berlin ; the reason why he remains in Prague is unknown.Hillerson, however, is not pleased with his supporters in Russia. His nose has been put out of joint by Kopp, who has been encroaching on his province and making purchases on behalf of the Soviet Govern-ment. Kopp recently failed to transmit to Hillerson 1,000,000 marks sent for that purpose by the Foreign Trade Department.It is reported that at a sitting of the Committee of the Eastern Rayon presumably the Eastern Sector of the Russian Communist Party in Germany Buttenfeld warned the Commissars against either writing or applying in person to Hillcrsou. Matters to be transmitted to him were to be delivered at the place appointed in Berlin, whence they would reach him and where his answer Avould also be received. The less important information was to be sent to the Committee in the Prisoners of War Camp in Josefstadt, whence it -would be forwarded as quickly as possible.According to the Communist paper &quot;Svoboda,&quot; Hillerson1s Red Cross Mission and paper, &quot; Solidarita,&quot; have been wound up by tho Government, ilillerson has two funds, one which he administers per-sonally, and from which he pays out money for SmeraFs propaganda ; the other entrusted to Vaclav, IIillerson&apos;s confidential assistant. Funds are destined specially for propaganda in Germany, Hungary, and Slovakia. Ilillerson has 12,000,000 kc. deposited in the Zemska Bank in Prague.Communist Movements.Bolshevism is showing no external activity. The leaders are disputing among themselves ; the Communist legionaries are intriguing against Dr. Smeral. A wholesome fear is also apparent that adherence to the Third International may result in Government interference on the ground that membership of the Third International endangers the State.After themselves contributing to tho withdrawal of the Social Democrats from the Cabinet, and so throwing the direction of foreign policy into the hands of the Right, the Communists have been com--plaining of the reactionary character of Czccho-Slovak foreign policy and the incipient rapprochement between Czocho-SloVakia and Poland.The Congress of the Left Wing of German Bohemian Socialists at Roichenberg decided to create a Communist party of German Bohemians adhering unconditionally to the Third International. It is reported that the Left Wing of Czech Labour will meet in May to establish a Communist party. Thereafter a unified Communist group will bo founded among the five nationalities within Czecho-Slovakia.At the Communist Conference at Bremen in December, Guttmann, chief, of the Bolshevik Department of Propaganda and Information in Czecho-Slovakia, stated that the centre of gravity in the countries of the Little Entente rested on Czecho-Slovakia. He denied that work among the Czech Communists had not led to the desired results, &quot;The
greatest difficulty was in the lield of foreign policy. In Czecho-Slovakia were many thousands of Ukrauian refugees. Guttmanu claimed that the Communists had not only secured those Ukrainian elements, which were naturally theirs, but also the bourgeois elements. They now possessed a considerable Red Ukrainian force which might boused at the proper time, and they had spread their influence throughout Galicia and Bukovina. Their propaganda bad brought about the painless liquidation of Pavlenko&apos;s army and of ibo Petlura movement.Miscellaneous.It is reported that the doctors of President Masaryk, after a consulta-tion in the middle of February, gave him at the outside three months to live. The succession to the presidency is believed to rest between Tomasck, Bones, and Samal.The authorities have discovered documents proving Gorman collusion with tho Hungarian agitation in Slovakia. Dr, Peters, of Prague, heads this organisation, which has created in tho &quot; Deiilsches Hans &quot; what is, in effect, a committee of action for separatist propaganda in Slovakia.The Union of Fanners is reported to be organising protest meetings for the end of March in the German-speaking districts against requisitions and controls, and against the new Bill regulating the compulsory con-tribution of a percentage of the crops.Inquiries for ploughs and agricultural machinery to be delivered free to Stettin have come from Germany to several Czech manufacturers. Prices were too high, however, and the goods were bought in Germany. There is no doubt that they were destined for Russia.Burian and Wolawa, editors of the Socialist daily &quot; Rovnosl,&quot; have been sentenced to 10 years&apos; hard labour for conspiring against the State during the general strike last December.A new clerical organisation, &quot; Lidova Obrana&quot; (Popular Guard) is said to be counselling its members to organise forces to support the troops against the proletariat.HUNGARY.Out of the political welter a big Liberal party is eniorging, which, it is hoped, will unito the Agrarian Democrats, the small holders and agricultural labourers, the Democratic and Radical bourgeoisie of the cities, and, perhaps, the workers of the towns. Though the peasants strongly oppose the return of the Hapsburg, some resentment appears to be felt at Italian and Czecho-Slovakian pronouncements on the subject.Reporting to the Communist Conference at Bremen in December, Guttuiann, chief of the Bolshevik Department of Propaganda and Infor-mation in Czeoho-Slovakia, admitted that Communist affairs in Him-gary were bad, and that it was impossible even to maintain the apparatus existing there formerly. They had only managed to preserve the Rudniansky organisation, which was far from yielding the estimated results. Kladno was the present centre of Hungarian Communist work ; in Pressburg the work consisted principally in solidifying the Coin-munist &quot; cells.&quot; The last stalwarts of the Hungarian Communist Party were Uiransh, Takatehi, and Igold.An attempted covp (Vital by tho ex-Emperor Karl has caused considerable unrest in Hungary. Leaving Switzerland on Good Friday, with a false Hungarian passport in the name of Gaspar Kovacs, the former Emperor is reported to have travelled via Strassburg and Vienna to the West Hungarian border town of Steinamanger, whore he attempted to obtain the assistance of Colonel Lehar, commanding a division in the
district. Help was refused, and Karl proceeded to Budapest on Easter Day. Here he had a lengthy conversation with Admiral Ilorthy, Regent of Hungary, in the course of which he is alleged to have asked the Regent to hand over his powers to him. This the Regent refused to do, and Karl eventually pledged himself to leave Hungary.He left for Switzerland on the morning of the 5th. Contrary to his expectation, the peasants and farmers showed no disposition to change their form of government.4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.The Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets.From the somewhat confused reports of the proceedings of the Tenth All-Russian Congress of Soviets emerges the fact that Bolshevik doctriuo is undergoing considerable changes and modifications. Moscow acknowledges that tho party has been split to the bottom by quarrels and such questions as tho trade unions, but declares hopefully that tho party is, as it was, a united party forged together by iron discipline It is admitted that the Bolsheviks were too hurried when they spoke of the coming of a peace period into the life of the Soviet. &quot;It is true, &quot; of course, that we have victoriously concluded the wars on the fronts, &quot; but our enemies continue to conduct the same war against us, but in &quot; other forms.&quot; &quot;The struggle organised by the Entente, the Social &quot; Revolutionaries, and the Mensheviks on the internal front is even more &quot; dangerous, as the exhaustion and poverty of the country after seven &quot; years of war is acutely felt at the present time.&quot; It is of course affirmed in a letter issued by the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party that all these difficulties will be overcome, and that the more firm, decisive, aud united the party is, the less faltering there will be among the insufficiently intelligent masses.Lenin spoke sombrely in addressing the Congress of Soviets. He predicted tho early suppression of the Kronstadt Revolution, which, ho added, forced the Soviet to consider most seriously the internal condition of Russia. They had made mistakes in food distribution ; the fuel crisis was duo to an attempt to restore industrial life on too largo a scale. The most important question of the moment was the relation between the working classes and tho peasants. The peasants considered that tho State demanded too great sacrifices of them ; their desires must bo met. The Soviet was therefore introducing a food tax in kind, imposed according to the moans of the peasant, and affording him a free field of action in his interests as a landowner. This tax would consume only part of the peasants harvest. He would have tho possibility of selling the surplus locally.The most significant discussion at the Congress was that on Bol-shevik agricultural policy and the relations of the Soviet Government and the peasants. This subject is dealt with in the first article of Part II. of this issue.The Co-operatives, Avhich still remain and which must bo preserved, were declared to provide the best machinery for distribution. Up to the present thoy had been utilised insufficiently, partly through error and partly through the struggle which the Soviet had been compelled to carry on against the Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who had entrenched themselves in the Co-operatives, and who, consciously or unconsciously, were re-establishing capitalism and assisting idlers.   Tho
resolution of the Ninth Congress was annulled. This resolution was passed on the recognition of the principles of contribution which have now been replaced by taxation in kind.A resolution was proposed by Comrade Yaroslavsky to approve the internal and foreign policy of the Central Committee. It pointed out, however, that the Congress had noted the insufficiency of unity in the Central Committee, which had lately shown itself during the discussion of certain practical questions, and of the role of trade unions in par-ticular, and which led to exceedingly acute discussions in the ranks of the party and unreasonable wasting of party forces to the detriment of other party problems, and especially to the detriment of increasing and strengthening the influence of the party on the wide non-party circles.In the matter of trade unions, regarding the issues of which an article appeared in Part II. of our February Report, three schemes for resolutions wore voted for: (1) that of Lenin, Zinovioff, and others; (2) that of Trotsky, Bukharin, and others ; (3) that of the group of the Labour opposition. The first resolution was carried and has now been submitted to a Special Commission to be completed. This Commission includes representatives of all parties. Moscow declares that the same course has been followed in connection with all other resolutions.In order to reach non-party members the Congress considered it imperative to include in the Central Committee organisers who have distinguished themselves in mass party work.In a letter to non-party members, ZinoviofF asserted that the Com-munists at whatever cost must gather in all honest non-party workmen and workwomen, a thing which hitherto had not been done sufficiently. Non-party workers would be appointed, entrusted with the most important work regarding food supplies, fuel, housing, and control of Soviet institutions in the work of combating bureaucratism. Meetings were to be held at all the factories and works in Petrograd, at which the question of the inclusion of non-party members would be raised. Representatives of non-party members would receive a most important share in tho purchase of foodstuffs abroad for gold in order to tide the Soviet over the difficult months.Krassikoff spoke on the question of religion, emphasising its importance in Russia, and the danger of disregarding it. It is not easy to follow the disconnected report of Krassikoffs speech, but ho would appear, to have argued that the peasants were controlled by the ideology, old or revised, of the priests and sects. The Communist party must exercise groat caution, in order that political and economic leadership should not escape from their hands. In spite of the caution necessary with regard to religious questions, they must definitely separate religion from politics and economics.Reporting on &quot; The Soviet Republic surrounded by Capitalism,&quot; KametiefF admitted that the Bolsheviks must discuss their relations with capitalistic countries, since the expected world revolution had not come to pass with the rapidity desirable. They still reckoned on the world revolution, but they must arrange a practicalpolicy &quot; shod on both feet,&quot; in case the course of world development forced them to struggle for the existence of the isolated Soviet Republic. KamenefF declared that Russia must begin to exploit her natural riches with unheard of rapidity. But that could not be done without the help of foreign capital and technical knowledge. &quot; By heroic efforts wo could restore our economic &quot; system ourselves, but it would require too prolonged a period. The &quot; foreign capitalist will not help you for nothing ; therefore we shall &quot; pay them a liberal tribute.&quot;0 as 8789 d
Jn his concluding; speech Lenin said that in September during the Party Congress they saw that their problem would be to cut away the healthy from the unhealthy. &quot; When we are told of the insufficient &quot; introduction of democratism, we agree that it is not sufficiently &quot; introduced among us. In this respect we require assistance and &quot; directions as to how it is to be introduced. There must be a real M introduction of democratism and not mere talk.&quot; Lenin denounced what he called the petty bourgeois tendency towards syndicalism, instancing the pamphlet by Kollontai, which argued that the organisation of public economics should beloug to tho Congress of Producers. Lenin added that the struggle against bureaucratism was essential and they would do everything to crush the bureaucratic idea, by advancing the workers from below. II&apos; this was called &quot; concessions&quot; there was uo doubt that 90 per cent, of the Congress would make those concessions. They were becoming exhausted from insufficiency of forces aud the slightest assistance of practical men would be welcomed with open arms.Afterthoughts and Explanations.The Moscow wireless is sending out messages dealing with the new relationship with or surrender to the peasants, which does, indeed, take some explaining to the fervents of the Third International abroad. The note of anxiety is predominant anil uumistakeablo, Thus, all members and agents of the party tire urged to help to bring about a business agreement in the form, most acceptable aud desirable to the peasants. The difficulty of the&apos; undertaking is admitted. &quot;The &quot; fundamental condition of this agreement is that certain freedom must &quot; be allowed the peasants with regard to dealing with and distributing &quot; food supplies.&quot;Explaining tho purposo of the new tax in kind as a now treaty between the workers and the peasants, Moscow says that tho proletariat and the peasantry are now concluding an agreemont for further economic struggle against World Capitalism.Social and Economic.The chief industries of Russia and tho supplies of grain, timber, hides and skins, fur, flax, and platinum having for diverse causes and in varying degrees failed, there is left in their place &quot; a gigantic economic &quot; vacuum, with no prospects of alleviation under the present political &quot; and economic conditions.&quot;Economic life in Russia is controlled by the Soviet of Peopled Economy or &quot; Sovnarkom,&quot; which has swelled into a huge and incalculably costly morbid growth, employing over 600,000 persons. It was created to bring about the direct transfer of goods from-the State to the consumer ; actually it has resulted in the consumer being unable to obtain the scanty produce obtainable. It has killed economic life and private enterprise, and its ruinous results have led the Soviet to a decision to compromise with foreign capitalists. The central organ of the &quot; Sovnarkom&quot; is the Moscow Collegiate, presided over by Rykov. The Collegiate is minutely subdivided.Bribery and corruption infect the higher grades of Communists. The struggle of certain Soviet departments against illegal trafficking is counterbalanced by the dishonest activity of others. Commissars engaged in this traffic, notable Zinovieff, have grown rich. One example may bo quoted. Last September the Norwegian Red Cross sent a quantity of food to the children of Petrograd, in charge of an appropriately named representative called Krok.   Krok disappeared after receiving
20 poods of the most valuable goods; the rest found their way to Zinovieff and his friends. The children got nothing, when  Trotsky some time after arrived in starving Petrograd, an ample provision of poultry and cheese was found for him.Faced with a growing agricultural crisis, Moscow now proclaims that the State will only give assistance with regard to such questions as cannot bo decided by local authorities. The local population is given complete independence in questions dealing with the actual technical side of agriculture. But it is significantly added that the decisions of the majority the Village Committees and the Sowing Committees  must be complied with by each farm owner. The introduction of com-pulsory measures for th%,improvement of agriculture is a form of &quot;self compulsion.&quot; Only by this moans can victory be gained over agricultural disorganisation.Meanwhile the economic situation is no better and there is scant prospect of its improvement before the autumn of 1922 at earliest. All reports go to emphasise the completeness of the economic collapse. The former daily food ration now has to servo for two days and will before long probably have to sorve for five. The authorities admit that the supply of boots will only provide one pair for every 2,500 persons. The Army and officials in the big towns have priority of supply. 200,000 pairs of boots, apparently surplus American Army stock from France, are, however, reported to be at Reval, awaiting despatch to Russia, and this should improve matters for the first 200,000 commissars.A sleeper crisis is now threatening. No sleepers are being made and there are no materials to repair the permanent way. Last year&apos;s expedient of removing one set of rails and sleepers from the double lines and repairing tho remaining single line is no longer possible.The fuel shortage on the railways has been aggravated by tho lack of horses and the consequent difficulty of moving wood. In many parts of the Tambov Government for instance, horses have fallen in number by 50 per cent. The remedial measures attempted.by the Government have failed. Tho &quot; five days period &quot; to assist the transport of felled wood to tho railways resulted in only 37 per cent, of the workers appearing, and only some 25 per cent, of the requisite amount being moved. According to Moscow, compressed fir cones have been successfully used as fuel on the Moscow-Kazan Railway. The lack of fuel has affected disastrously what remained of Russian industry. In Petrograd 90 factories and works closed down during February, affecting some 300,000 (?) men. Of the general condition of affairs in 1920-21 some idea can be formed,from the article entitled &quot; The Transport Debacle &quot; in Part II. of this issue. 2,000,000 poods of cotton which are Baid to be lying in Transcaspia cannot be transported to the interior. Some 700,000 poods of cotton are available in the Central Governments. The flax harvest is very poor, and crops cannot be transported to the factories. The Government is now printing 50,000 rouble notes. Moscow reported significantly on March 4th that Lenin had ordered the Samara District Food Committee to send to Moscow within 10 days not less than 4,800 tons of wheat, and the Saratoff District Food Committee to send within the same period 2,400 tons of bread.   A mixture of oats in the bread was not permitted.Like the rest of Russia tho Ukraine is undergoing a severe food crisis. 40 per cent, of tho land usually cultivated lies waste, and in spite of such barbarities as the burning of villages the peasants are very unwilling to deliver their stores. The villages have necessaries enough, except salt, but famine reigns in the towns. Fuel is very short ; transport is irregular and failing ; trade is practically dead.   The towns sell and thed 2
villages buy. In towns such as Kharkov a pair of boots costs 100,000 roubles.   Terror and desolation are universal.Not Siberia, but tho Petchora River District is now the convict settlement. It is a country 600 versts by reindeer sleigh from Archangel. It holds some 5,000 persons, mainly of the bourgeoisie. In the Vologda penal settlement are about 18,000 persons of both sexes. The conditions aro appalling, and the death rate is said to be 2,000 to 3,000 a month.Russian emigrants returning from America or Germany do not receive a warm welcome. There is no work for thorn. German specialists by whose help Russia hopes to rebuild her industries are anxious to return to Germany.The Stradivarius Quartette consists of thdibest artists in Moscow, who are supplied with Stradivari us instruments from the State collection of Ancient and Rare Instruments, which has been formed as a result of nationalisation. After a competition in the spring, all tho instruments in tho collection will be handed to tho best artists to use for three years on condition that they give a few free concerts every year. The State instruments havo already been going round for three years by means of public competitions.The Political Groups.Five distinct groups are at present apparent in Russia. Tho smallest and least important aro the Sapronov group, which broke away from Schliapnikov on questions of &quot;Democratic Centralisation &quot; and &quot;Soviet Constitutionalism,&quot; and the Ignalov group, composed of Moscow Com-munists and workmen, also dissident from Schliapnikov. Tho other groups are : (a) The Lenin-Zinovieff group, relying on tho professional unions,Communists among the Intelligentsia and the workmen generally. The Rikov-Lttnacharsky group, representing tho extreme Right, may bo counted in this group. Lenin is said to bo now more amenable to their idea of calling a Constituent Assembly.(b) The Trotsky group, comprising  loss  influential  Communistelements and the Left Wing leaders, and relying on the support of the Army, This group includes the extreme activists, Bukharin and his supporters, and internal differ-ences exist, though tho general policy of,both parties is the same.(c) The Schliapnikov group, which has obtained the support of the metal Workers&apos; Union, and may eventually have an important influence against the Lenin group. Lenin is said to havo told the ail-Russian Trades Unious Soviet that if the groups did not reach an agreement it proved that Communism was suffering from an unhealthy dislocation caused by a &quot; Children&apos;s illness&quot; or a party inclination to move to the left. The quarrel had a deadly smell, and he who inhaled it was lucky if he avoided its fatal poison. Bukharin was inclined to put the blame for the split on the discords of Lenin and Trotsky.Trade Delegations as Revolutionary Propagandist Organisations.The instructions issued to the Soviet Trade Delegation in Constanti-nople and obtained on March 17th leave no doubt that tho ostensible trade activities of tho Soviet were intended within tho period of six or eight months preceding the signature of the Trade Agrcemont with Groat
Britain on March 16th to cover political propaganda. The document, which deals with the political work of the Delegation, defines its activities in the following terms : -(1) Trade relations must serve the interests of Communist propaganda of the Third International. An object of first importance is to spread discontent among the population, preparing strikes and disturbances. The Soviet Government instructs its foreign representatives to enter into negotiations with foreign firms on a trade basis. The Soviet representatives must insist on State guarantees on the part of foreign capitalist Governments. As none of the capitalist powers have recognised the Soviet Government these guarantees cannot be given and negotiations must inevitably fail. The Communists should then commence agitation among the foreign workmen concerned, explaining that owners had refused large orders from tho Soviet because tho capitalist Governments objected to trade with Russia, and withheld the necessary guarantees. Agitators must point out that owing to such action of the capitalists, Soviet Russia was compelled to approach firms of friendly States to fulfil orders. Such agitation will produce strikes which should be materially supported with a view to aggravating economic conditions, and, finally, fo causing revolution.(2) Organising Communist party.(3) Efforts to buy foreign press.(4) Establishment of Communist cells in countries to which the Delegation is accredited. Incitement of soldiers and sailors against the officer class.(5) Organising workmen&apos;s Soviets of a militant character within the Labour movement.(6) Arming of workmen.(7) Agitation amongst demobilised soldiers.(8) Concentration of all economic and industrial organisations in thehands of the working class. (9) Active measures, including terrorism, to combat White Guardelements.(10) Organisation of agitators forming secret revolutionary staffs.(Signed)      N. Bukharin, Y. Berzin,For the Executive of the Third International. Pavlovich, Weltman,Responsible representatives of the Council for Propaganda and Action in the East.Advices subsequently obtained tend to the same conclusion. A leading Norwegian Communist, absolutely in the confidence of the authorities of the Third International, told a companion on March 26th that members of the Russian Trade Delegation were assisting, the organising of Labour demonstrations. It has been ascertained that the Russian Trade Delegation referred to is Krassin&apos;s in London and not Litvinoffs at Reval.A letter from a British Communist in Moscow, dated March 19th,. reports that the Executive Council there of the International Council of Labour Unions was proposing to divide 50,000^. into several sums to finance the work of the whole movement in the various countries.
The German movement is estimated to cost 2,000/. a month, About the application ol&quot; the money in England there was discussion in the Execu-tive Council between Murphy and Losowsky, and the matter was finally referred to a sub-committee to discuss the finance of the International Trade Union movement, with special reference to the curtailing of the work and expenditure in England, from the extravagance of which the discussion had arisen. There was no indication that the signature of the Trade Agreement would make any difference.Indications are now coming to hand that Soviet Government con-siders the time at hand for working up the big fight. The Copenhagen police have heard from good sources that disturbances have been ordered to commence throughout Scandinavia. Traumael says orders have arrived to work energetically and have things ready. Torgeirsen says plans were laid at Stockholm, at Easter, for a conference for industrial trouble throughout Europe. The Norwegian Transport Workers&apos; Com-mittee propose working up a strike gradually on local pretexts. The Norwegian National Labour Party received on April 3rd renewed instruc-tious to prepare the ground unceasingly. The Scandinavian Communists are to be got ready for the call, but the rank and file are not to know the real aim, and instructions have been sent to Italy, France, Holland, Czecho-Slovakia, and Spain.On January 13th, A. Watts and W. Rothstoin Avere given instructions from the Moscow centre to go to Ireland for revolutionary propaganda, for which purpose a grant of 400,000/. was authorised. Both refused, however, on the ground that they were too well known to the authorities to have any chance of carrying on successful propaganda in Ireland. They agreed to direct the Irish revolutionary movement from a quarter outside British police jurisdiction. Krassiu is said to have taken with him to London the same instructions for the co-ordination of the Irish revolutionary movement. Litvinoff is reported to have received iustruc-tions from Zinovieff on March 29th to arm Bolshevik &quot; germ-cells &quot; in Dublin through Krassin to the amount of 50,000/., a sum sufficient, it is believed, to prolong the Sinn Fein rebellion for some mouths. This report, which comes from a source hitherto found entirely reliable, is being investigated further. If true, the action of the Soviet Government constitutes a definite breach of the undertakings regarding hostile political action and propaganda in the Trade Agreement.The question of the continuance of the subversive activities of the Third International in England is a complex one. It is believed, how-over, that one party in the Soviet Government, acting largely as regards foreign affairs under the advice of Litvinoff, has never believed that the Trade Agreement would be signed, and has prevailed with the Soviet Government to continue its subversive activities with regard to England right up to the signing of the Trade Agreement.Communist Propaganda.In answer to an inquiry from the Executive Committee of the Third International, most of the European Communist groups would appear to have informed Moscow that some time in March of this year seemed to them the most favourable moment for International revolutionary action, but if that moment should be impossible it would be best to wait till the end of the summer of this year, It is significant that nearly every Com-munist group maintained that it could achieve victory, provided that the revolutionary movement had previously succeeded in the neighbouring country. Not one, however, felt itself strong enough to bring about unaided a revolution in its own country.
The system of secret propaganda which Moscow has skilfully organised in foreign countries would appear to have its European branches con-neeted with Moscow by seven lines of communication. That for England runs by way of Moscow, Murmansk, Bergen, and Hull, but is rarely used. The Moscow-Reval route, perhaps the most important of all, which connects the Soviet Government with Berlin and Copenhagen, and which is directed by Litvinoff in person, is an alternative route to Great Britain. This and the Moscow-Warsaw-Prague route are con-stantly used by Bolshevik couriers. Other routes run to Bucharest and Sofia. ,A Bolshevik document sets forth a scheme for coastal navigation, and for disposing of cargo and passengers unknown to the authorities of the country visited. Where control is strict; it is suggested that literature, &amp;e., should be taken ashore in instalments by the crew. As for furnishing agents going ashore with documents, it is hinted that people from the shore could bo bribed to give up their documents, and once their papers have been taken possession oi&apos;vthey could be retained aboard and landed in Russia. &quot; This,&quot; runs the sinister comment, &quot; would be an effective way of keeping them from giving information afterwards.&quot; It is advised that particular attention should be given to Reval, Riga, Helsingfors, and Dantzig ; the captain of the vessel should be either a Finn or an Esthonian, according to the flag flown, and an experienced Communist; the members of the crew should be Communists. The ships must bo prepared before-hand for the concealing of literature and other secret cargo.Moscow has sent out general instructions for the establishment of Communist trade unions, or, where that is not feasible, *of germ-cells among oxisting trade unions. International and local sympathetic action is to be encouraged ; taxpayers&apos; and tenants&apos; strikes and the formation of Communist trade unions among Government employees are to be encouraged. Agitation is to be specially aimed at Great Britain, and terrorism is to be organised in British colonies and protectorates.The Red Army,At a military conference in Moscow, over which General Brussiloff presided, it was said that on the whole the Soviet Government could count upon 900,000 rifles and 82,000 sabres in case of attack, exclusive of 120,000 men employed in the maintenance of order in the interior. The question of demobilisation seems, however, to be causing much unrest. It is said that the Communist officers, no matter what their rank, only want to be sent home, and do all they can to get themselves sent to the rear. Czarist officers have been used to replace them, a fact which has made an impression&apos; on the army. In the army itself only 12 per cent, of the soldiers appear to be Communists and 30 per cent, sympathisers with Communism. Trotsky advocated the incorporation of demobilised men in militia regiments, a proposal which was strongly opposed by Brussiloff. Ultimately, on the motion of the Commander-in-Chief, Kameneff, it was decided to demobilise a tenth of the troops on the lines of communication and to send half of the so-called inactive troops (Army Service Corps, &amp;e.) to garrisons near the front and on active service. The troops at the front are to be demobilised on a system which permits of their being replaced at a moment&apos;s notice by troops in the garrisons near the front.   This proposal was accepted.The partial demobilisation of the Red Army would appear to bo dependent in each individual case on the degree of the soldier&apos;s attach-ment to Communism. Every demobilised man must go through a &quot; communising&quot; course before he returns home in order that the state
of things in liis native town or village may not try his Communist faith too severely. The delay in demobilisation is to be explained by the authorities&apos; fear of its consequences.Indiscreet talk which followed a banquet given by the Bolshevik Mission at Riga is said to have made apparent that the chief Bolshevik plans for the future hinge on war between Japan and United States, a war in which the Bolsheviks consider that England must engage, to them it is immaterial ou which side. When this happoiiB, the Reds hope to mate with the German Radicals to overthrow all European Governments, aud thus obtain their world revolution.It is reported that the chief military objects of the Soviet are, firstly, the establishment of a Central European bridgehead, and secondly, the taking up of strong positions near the Indian and Chinese borders, which aro needed to back the revolutions now being prepared there. The attain-ment of these objects is necessary as they are bases from which to start tho European Red war of 1922. A Bolshevik attack on Roland and Roumania is said to be unavoidable. Moscow only hesitates from differences of opinion regarding the partition of Roland aud Roumania.Trade Matters.Announcing the ratification of various treaties, Moscow declares that the trade agreement with Great Britain not only means the resumption of commercial and other relations with Great Britain but with a series of bourgeois Slates which come within the sphere of British influence. It claims that by the agreement Great Britain indirectly recognises the Soviet Government, and that the door to a similar agreement with the United States of America will thereby open. Moscow joyfully fore-shadows that the States which have hitherto hesitated from concluding an agreement with Russia will now probably hasten to enter into relations with her.The Ail-Russian Central Executive Committee has sent au appeal for the resumption of trade relations to President Harding and to the United States Congress. Russia&apos;s good faith and anxiety to establish friendly relations with America aro insisted upon. It is declared that the Soviet Republic, being absorbed in the great task of reconstructing its economic life, has not the slightest intention of interfering with the internal affairs of the United States.The Soviet Government is reported to have determined to approach all foreign firms which owned property and factories in Russia before the revolution, and to offer these firms their own factories as concessions. Various conditions are annexed. Thus the name of the firm must be changed, to avoid the suggestion that firms trading under the Tsarist Government have been admitted ; tho companies must be re-capitalised, and the capital brought into Russia, either in foreign money or goods. The Soviet will pay 10 per cent, per annum interest on capital and will repay the capital itself at 4 per cent, per annum. Workmen must bo engaged and a show of work made immediately. The Soviet will pay, in roubles, all the expenses of the factories and will guarantee a profit of 15 per cent, in roubles, to the firm&apos;s representative in Russia, as long as the Soviet retains the firm&apos;s capital. This scheme would appear to be largely an attempt to obtain real money ; it offers little inducement to foreign capitalists. Nor do the Bolsheviks intend to keep their promises. Nevertheless a quantity of firms, mostly Swedish, have signed agree-ments.Moscow reported on March 27th that by order of the Commissariat of Labour and Defence a Delegation would in a few days leave for abroad
for the purpose of inspecting ami hastening the delivery of various goods which were on order. Moscow states thai it is reported from London that a contract was signed there on March 16th for the purchase of 18,500,000 poods (approximately 300,000 tons) of coal tor Russian industries.The Soviet has contracted with an American firm for the supply of 5,000,000 pairs of military boots and 1,000 tons of sole leather. Payment is to be made in gold, and 567,000 roubles in gold has been placed to the credit of the contracting firm in the Harju Bank, Reval. It is interesting to note that Max ltabinoff is trying to get permission to sell 600,000 roubles in the U.S.A. The first consignment of boots 1,500,000 pairs  was expected to reach Reval about the end of February. The first consignment of gold in payment for American boots has been despatched to tho U.S.A. via Sweden by tho s.s. &quot; Kalevipoog.&quot;Evidence of Mr. Krassin&apos;s Germanophile bias in matters of trade and industry were forthcoming during his visit to Moscow, when he sent a Russian electrician named Eisenstein to Berlin to attend the Electricians&apos; Conference there. During his stay in Berlin, Krassin is said to have given large orders to the Allgomeino Eleotrizitats Gesellschaft aud to the electrical firm &quot; Osram.&quot; His negotiations with the Allgemeine Electrizitats Gesellschaft aud with Stinncs&apos; representatives dealt especially with schemes for the electrification of Russia. The negotia-tions were left to the care of Zabloudovski.Mohamed Waly-Khan, who calls himself the Ambassador of the Amir of Afghanistan, affirms that he has signed in Moscow a provisional trade agreement on behalf of Afghanistan.Vauderlip has been in Stockholm under the name of W. B. Vincent, lie was due to leave for Moscow on February 21th and arrived there on March 1st. He declared that his object was to prepare the opening of consular, postal and telegraph offices, and the establishment of commercial relations between the United States and Soviet Russia arrangements which be hoped would bo in working order by tho middle of May.Moscow states that the Japanese are envious of the concessions granted to Mr. Vanderlip. They have presented many petitions to the Government of the coast region for permission to survey Kamchatka.Risings and Insurrections.Savinkoff is reported to have presided at a meeting held in Warsaw early iu March, at which details for the general rising in tho Ukraine ordered for the 2nd of April were discussed. Ukrainian peasant leaders, whose bands are already operating, were present at the meeting in order to discuss the situation and to decide a common plan of action.According to Moscow, General Kozlovsky was not the principal leader of the anti-Bolshevik rising in Petrograd, though he Avas reckoned the official head. The General&apos;s two brothers have been arrested in the Marine School in Pctrograd.Makhno would appear to be still active, and to have a large following among the peasants. Early in the year he was reported to be as far north as Kursk, Avhere he was trying to join up with the insurgents under Autonoff. He is said to have now headed south again, and to have occupied Elizavetgrad and Ekaterinoslav. He has a way of executiug all Commissars and Communists Avhen he enters a town. The other inhabitants can buy peace at very high prices.According to information derived from the Social-Revolutionary leaders in Vladivostok, the anti-Bolshovik peasant movement is groAving and is assuming an organised democratic tendency.   Delegates of the
Peasants&apos; Unions and secret military organisations have arrived in Vladivostok to try lo unite both groups to tight the Bolsheviks, at the same time avoiding undertakings of a reactionary nature and involving intervention as likely to destroy the movement. A secret committee has been formed in Vladivostok representing all Democrats and Right Social-Revolutionaries.   The financial difficulties are, however, extreme.In Podolia the Bolshevik garrisons have been turned out of most of the cities and replaced by Ukrainians. Petlura has issued a pro-elamatiou in which he asks all classes and nationalities in the Ukraine to join hands, tight the bandits, and stop the pogroms.A message from Tarnopol alleges that the Soviet garrison of Kieft&apos; is in action against the insurgents, who have killed a whole Rod detach-ment, as well as many Bolshevik commissaries and authorities. The Ataman Stronk is directing the insurgents. Rakovsky, president of the Soviet commissaries, is said to have offered the Atamau a full amnesty and high rank in the Red Army in return for a promise to discontinue his attacks against the Soviet Government. Strouk&apos;s answer was another appeal to his men to continue the struggle.The Ukraine is disturbed from end to end, and there is hardly a district without an insurgent band and chief. The revolt tends to coalesce into a uniform movement, and the situation of the Bolsheviks is precarious. An &quot;Ukrainian Salvation Committee &quot; which seeks to become the Central directing authority of the insurgents has now arisen and has wide ramifications. It is in touch with most of the insurgent chiefs and under the special protection of the Ataman Strouk, who has been given the honorary title of &quot; People&apos;s Ataman of the Province of Kiev.&quot; Strouk would appear to be waxing at the expense of Makhno. He is bidding, not without success, for&apos;Jewish support, an event which has so impressed the Ukrainian population that it is ceasing to confound Jews and Bolsheviks in indiscriminate massacres.Relations with Turkey.Speaking at the beginning of March on the International situation, Lenin sententiously remarked that the conference with the Turkish delegates in Moscow was the most important factor in Russia&apos;s inter-national situation. It was a further proof of the rapprochement of Soviet Russia with other oppressed nations, in which countries the influence of Soviet Russia was increasing.Speaking at the Russo-Turkish Conference at Moscow, Tchitcherin put the best complexion on things by explaining that the movement in Turkey had not yet become a Communist revolution ; Turkey, however, was no longer Imperialist, but a Turkey of peasants and small artisans taking their destiny into their own hands. Yusuf Kemal Bey, the president of the Turkish Delegation, rejected the Treaty of Sevres and said that everything pointed to Turkey the way leading towards Russia. &apos; Neither Turkey nor Russia would submit to capitalist domination; the two forces must act in agreement. Moscow, the forces of Communism, and Turkey, were forces of aspirations aiming at the emancipation of the Oriental world. The Turkish Delegation wished to start, pourparlers and to reach some result as soon as possible.Moscow and Zion.Iu consequence of the treatment of members of Poale Zion in Russia, the party is urging Poale Zion parties in other countries not to adhere to the Third International, au action which has caused dissension iu the
ranks of Poale Zion in Austria, Hungary, and Czecho-Slovakia. The question of adherence tot he Third International will ho decided at a conference to he held in Vienna or in Prague in April, &quot; Der Jiddischo Arheiter,&quot; tho organ for the Poale Zioti in Russia, has published an article attacking the Soviet Government for carrying on reprisals against the Jews. At a meeting held by Poale Zion it was decided to send notes to the Soviet Government and to the Third International, protesting against these reprisals. The result was the arrest and execution of a number of Poale Zionists.Eastern Intrigue.The Bolsheviks are said to dream of founding in the Far East a &quot; Council of Action and Propaganda,&quot; similar to that established for tho Near East. Before this Council is established the Bolsheviks contemplate a Congress of Far Eastern Communists, on lines similar to the Congress of Eastern Peoples, held in Baku last August. Shanghai, where Far Eastern Communists are congregating, may be the place of meeting.Tho Council of Propaganda ami Action in Baku is reported to have recently sent two agitators to Afghanistan, one to Khiva, three to Bokhara, and three to Tndia. These people are provided with money and diamonds. The Council will in futuro be under the control of the Moscow Department for Eastern Affairs, it having been discovered that money allocated for propaganda purposes has been squandered.Meetings and Congresses.It is reported that the Red Trade Union Congress, which was to have been held on May 1st, has been postponed until July 1st.Moscow has decided that proletariat demonstrations should be organised in all countries on May 1st. A special committee of five, with Radek as chairman, is drawing up the manifesto.Moscow announces that the Third All-World Congress of the Third Communist International will be convened on June 1st. Prominent on the agenda of the Congress is the question of the relations of the Italian Socialist Party and of tho Communist Labour Party of Germany with the International. The appeals of these two parties against the resolution of the Executive Committee of the International are to be considered.The Ukraine.The Fifth All-Ukranian Congress of Soviets has decided that in districts where land has been redistributed peasant farmers must be given the right to hold the land at present cultivated by them for a period of nine years. Measures ensuring this must be completed in the shortest possible time, and the rights of the peasant owners must be confirmed. In securing the rights of the peasant farmers to their holdings permission must first be obtained from the local committee of Poor Peasants.A meeting of Ukrainian Communists hostile to the Petlura regime, at which representatives of the Kamenetsk Podolsk organisation in Prague attended, passed a resolution to the effect that attempts at peaceful work for Russia were frustrated by the violent and arbitrary methods of the Moscow representatives. Instances of tyranny towards Ukraniaus wore cited.Representatives of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic are to be attached to the Russian Soviet Delegations abroad.
Miscellaneous.Klishko&apos;s recommendations for the composition of Russian Delegations abroad include a secretary of the Delegation with assistant, and a Charge d&apos;Affaires and Head of the Chancery, also with assistant. The whole stall&apos;of the Delegation would consist of 21 persons.Moscow has sent out a very definite order for the militarisation of the railways as a decisive measure to improve and develop transport. This militarisation was of the greatest importance during the period of counter-revolutionary activity. Support of the transport workers was asked, and the workers in their turn were asked to remember their duties.Eiduk has now become chief assistant to litvinoff at Revnl in matters of espionage and counter-espionage.The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is publishing under conditions of extreme secrecy a secret otlicial newspaper which tells the whole truth about Russia. It is reported to give ample evidence of the desperate situation ef the country.FINLAND.The Communist Campaign.The results of the Communist campaign against the Social Democrats are becoming visible. The Communists are gaining victories in the trade unions ; they completely control the Young Peopled Association. They will apparently play a bigger part in politics than many thought probable. The Communists direct the amnesty question behind the scenes, while the Social Democrats play a thankless part in tho Diet. The future seems to lie in the ability of the labour movement to resist Communist attacks. A Communist victory would mean industrial chaos. In llelsingfors, where conditions favour the extremists, tho Central Council of the metal workers has stood strongly against Communist temptations. At present a vote is being taken on affiliation to tho Amsterdam International. Fear of the Government restrains the advocates of the Moscow International from openly declaring themselves.Communist organisations on the lines of the Defence Corps have now been formed all over Finland. The Socialist Labour Party has been admitted to membership in the Third International, and the Social Democratic Young People&apos;s Association has resolved to join the Communist Young Pcople&apos;s International. The total membership of the Finnish Communist Party is now put at 30,000. The Party has issued a leaflet advocating the removal in time of the principal leaders of the Defence Corps and prescribing means of preventing the work of the Corps.At the beginning of March placards signed by the local Communist party, and preaching revolution and a Soviet dictatorship, were found nailed up in Viborg. Shots seem to have been fired at the police who went to take these placards down. . -The Plot in Carelia.The plot to make trouble in Carelia on the evacuation of Ropola and Porajarvi in accordance with the terms of the Dorpat Peace Treaty is said to have been more than purely local. The intention was to bring about renewed hostilities with Russia, and to resume the military adventures which the Government opposes.    1,000 rifles and much
45ammunition had been collected, which, with the exception of 200 rifles, have been brought to Ilelsingfors. A secret cypher discovered was used for communicating with the Jaeger Club in llelsingfors, a secret and pro-German institution, which is also in touch with certain Russians, Negotiations also appear to have been attempted with the Japanese ambassador, from whom 8.000,000 marks wore expected, but whether the ambassador actually promised financial support is uncertain. There are suspicions that bad the movement succeeded in its first stages, General Mannerhcim was to come in and head it. The General went abroad abruptly soon after tho discovery of the affair. He is now back in llelsingfors, but is said to bo leaving again shortly. He is rumoured to havo intended to visit Munich and Biarritz. At Biarritz he was to meet certain White Russian leaders, including Denikin.Baltic States, LATVIA.Bolshevik Activities.There are in Latvia no fewer than 25 political parties, of which, 16 are represented in the Constituent Assembly. The Peasant Alliance is the most influential party ; the Social Democrats are the most Left of the parties represented. This party is very anti-English, and is the channel of Communist activities. It is reported that the Communists will take part in the elections to tho Lettish Parliament, with the object of dis-organising and discrediting Parliament and all its activities.Shapil, tho Bolshevik representative in Libau, is said to take advantage of tho poverty of tho Russian committee iu Libau and its consequent inability to offer anything but scanty help to poor Russians and refugees, to assist these people very liberally. The natural result has boon a certain accession of sympathy to the Bolshevik cause.The Government has given permission to Sachs, of the Soviet Delo-gation in Riga, to use one of the nationalised printing presses iu Riga, aud to work under Government observation. Swedish firms refused to treat with Sachs.The Bolshevik paper &quot; Novy Putt,&quot; published in Russian at Riga, would appear to find few readers, in spite of efforts -to increase the circulation. The Government has now prohibited the selling of the paper at a rate bolow the published price. The editor is one Ivan Dreyfeld, a Lett of doubtful character. , .German Activities.Officers of the 1st Libau Regiment are reported to have notified the Government of their resentment at the Social Democrat attitude towards tho Government and the Army. They threatened forcibly to show their disapproval of Communist demonstrations.Numbers of committees, heavily subsidised by the Gorman Goveru-ment, are reported to have been set up iu Germany with tho object of promoting German interests in the Baltic States by tho return thither of their former German inhabitants. Baltic barons are for the most part the organisers of these committees in East Prussia.The resident agent at Riga of the Russian Monarchist Centre has recently been instructed to endeavour to become chief of the anti-Bolshevik Intelligence and counter-espionage service in Latvia,- in order to counteract Bolsheviks and Social Revolutionaries, and to keep friendly observation ou Cadet activities.   He is to organise a counter-espionage
system in Latvia and an intelligence system there aud in Russia, as well as activities in Moscow and Potrogad, Lettish official representatives ill Russia and the Lettish Secret Service arc to be used it&apos; possible. Tho instructions contain an intimation to the agent to bear constantly in miud that bis work aud activities ate in no way to harm German interests in general and in Russia.ESTHONIA.General.Communism is meeting with lit tie success among the Esthoniaus, who have before their eyes the example of Soviet Russia.Litvinoffs Position and Activities.The signing of the Trade Agreemont has put Litvinoff in an exceedingly difficult position with his own Government. Litvinoif had been consistently advising the Soviet Foreign Office that the agreement would never be signed, and had given his whole support to the continu-iinoe oi the policy of subversion in the countries of tho West. It is believed also that when the peasant insurrections of February and March eame^to a head litvinoff was discovered by the Soviet authorities to be playing a double game. The general effect has been to his discredit, anil it is reported that the influence of the Trading Tarty in the Soviet Government may now so far predominate as to have him moved on to America as the successor of Martens in case American trade policy in Soviet Russia should change. Litvinoff was at one time the principal intermediary between the Soviet Government and Vanderlip. it is believed that his transference to it sphere of action in which his activities would be comparatively innocuous would not be unwelcome toM.Krassin and other Russian statesmen of the &quot;German&quot; school. It is unlikely that the American Government will grant him a visa for the United States.Litvinoffs appointment to Reval has had evident results, among which may be noted the increased activity of tho political section in propaganda and agitation abroad, the increase of the Delegation staff to 200 members, the employment of 150 agents for the Saiiitaraya under Kalakulsky, and the establishment of a courier service every three days between Reval and Berlin. The Trade Section is busy obtaining arms and equipment for the Red Army, and the head of the Delegation is working for closer relations with the Esthonian Government with a view to exercising influence over it. Litvinoff appears to have been ordered to buy as much material as possible by the end of March ; ho has also been instructed to buy 250,000 yards of army cloth in Sweden. Propa-ganda literature, which he has been told to forward, has been dispatched to Litvinoff from Russia, and Litvinoff has had orders to organise meetings locally and to establish close contact with the illegal Esthoniati Communist organisations.It is reported that since the end of January litvinoff has been issuing direct instructions to Kalakutsky (alias Makarov) and his Sanitariya organisation, who are becoming very active. Kalakutsky is in close touch with Kingisepp, tho Esthonian Communist leader ; he is helped by the local Communist organisations. Information as to foreign intelligence organisations, particularly the British and Polish, the names of prominent Esthonian officers and others, the work of the Russian White Cross organisation, and how much tho British know of the work done by British Soviet agents, e.(/., Watts, Rothstein, and others, are special subjects of investigation.   Kalakutsky has beou instructed to observe
245particularly the British military representative, and to report on him every three days to Moscow. He is trying to get into local White organisations, and has reported to Trotsky on a general amnesty to all members of the former N.W, Army and their return to Russia. The expulsion of Kalakutsky has been asked for, and his work has been exposed in the press.Litvinoff &apos;s said to wish to replace Salomon by two trade representa-tives, one a special Soviet plenipotentiary, the other a &quot;controller.&quot; Each will apparently watch the other&apos;s activities. Tho new All-Russian Cheka (Extraordinary Commission) agents, named Himmelstein and Hottoki (alias Harrokiri) and others have reached Reval from Russia.Rending a legal settlement the authorities liavo sequestered the Bolshevik gold deposit with the Bank of Esthonia. This action follows the neglect of the Bolshevik Trade Delegation to pay sums due to a local merchant and to the owners of s.s. &quot; Baltona.&quot; Tho Bolsheviks are becoming increasingly dilatory in settling accounts.It is alleged that packages passing from Germany through Reval to Russia, though disguised as Red Cross stores, contain automatic gun parts for the Red Army. Most of the Customs and Frontier Control Officials are said to be in the pay of the Bolsheviks.The Communist Organisation.The Esthonian Section of the Third International has issued compre-hensive instructions to the secret Esthonian Communist Party, These provide for the careful organisation of &quot;shock&quot; parties, so formed that the members know neither each&quot; other nor their &quot; shock &quot; leader. Reval should have at least live &quot;shock &quot; detachments ; other towns may have less. The whole of Esthonia is to be covered by&quot; shock &quot; organisations. The only person who will know all is the responsible organiser. On the Soviet Delegation at Reval falls the duty of supporting and equipping the organisations. Only the responsible organiser should know this, and not any others. In order to avoid complications, the revolution is only to take place with the knowledge of the Third International, and the Soviet Delegation will not hesitate to assist the Esthonian proletariat when the time comes. The Soviet representative protects illegal party comrades. Should one of these be arrested Soviet Russia claims him as a Russian subject, and he is deported to Russia. It is also intimated that Russia is ready to prepare for war when her demands are not fulfilled and a state of terror exists. Characteristic provisions are added for the destruction of organisations which become known, and for screening the Soviet Delegation. Meanwhile it is reported that the Esthonian Com-munists aro hurriedly preparing to establish a Soviet regime in Esthonia this spring, and there is close contact between Russian and Esthonian Communists. Furthermore, a line of action similar to that proposed for Esthonia is, so it is stated, to be applied to all countries.No great success is rewarding the active propaganda of the Inde-pendent Socialists and the Communists. Their appeals for the overthrow of the Government have been coldly received. The results of the local government elections afford another proof of the decaying power of the Left.   The Social Democrats lost many seats to the Centre and Right.Professor Piip has declined litvinoff&apos;s suggestion that certain Com-munists now being tried at Dorpat on charges of agitation should bo sent to Russia as being Russian subjects.Miscellaneous.Since Esthonia concluded peace with Russia, approximately 15,000,000 roubles in gold have passed to Esthonia for trade purposes ; 100,000,000
roubles in transit through Esthonia (up to January lath, 1921), and 100,000,000 roubles to Esthonian banks. During the same period 136,01)0,000 poods of propaganda literature passed through Reval.M. Wares, the first Esthonian Minister to Soviet Russia, left Reval for Moscow on February 8th. M, Wares is an authority on economic matters concerning Soviet Russia. His assistant and commercial attache is Eri Pest.The Russian Social Revolutionary group in Esthonia is reported to have six leaders representing both wings of the party. It publishes two papers, and is connected with the Communist parly in Russia through a Communist at Pskov.LITHUANIA.The section of the population taking any interest in international politics is very small, and densely ignorant. Its outlook is very narrow, and it dominates tho peasants, who take no interest in politics. The Government and party loaders are without definite policy and out of touch with the situation a state of affairs which is being exploited by the Bolsheviks.The Lithuanian authorities are reported to have arrested Weingardt, chief of German secret police in Lithuania during the German occupa-tion, and assistant to Liptchus, the present head of the Lithuanian Intelligence Service, on proof that he was giving information to the Bolsheviks.POLAND. The Russo-Polish Peace Treaty.The Russo-Ukrainian-Polish Peace Treaty is reported to have been signed on March 18th. Ratification is to take place in 30 days. The treaty provides for the payment of 30,000,000 gold roubles to Poland within one year ; the return by Russia of all deposits by Polish subjects in Russian banks and payment for &quot; nationalised &quot; Polish manufactories in gold. Russia is to return to Poland 300 engines, 260 passenger carriages, and 8,000 goods trucks ; the Ukraine is to return to Poland 255 engines, 435 passenger carriages, and 8,800 goods trucks.The newly appointed Soviet representative at Warsaw, Prince Obolienski, was the first member of the Russian aristocracy to join the Bolsheviks. IIo had charge of the troops who seized the national bank. &apos;The Peasant Party and Russia.A meeting of members of the Polish Peasant Party and loaders of the local branch of the &quot; Union for the Resurrection of Russia&quot; was held in Warsaw at the beginning of March. The Polish Peasant Party arranged the meeting on the ground that a. democratic government would be formed in Russia, and that it would be advisable to enter beforehand into friendly relations with democratic Russian elements in Poland, The members of the Peasant Party argued that when the Bolsheviks fell Polish occupation of portions of White Russia would automatically end unless the population voted for inclusion in Poland. The eastern frontier of Poland, as recently defined, was only provisional, and would have to be redefined on the collapse of the Soviet regime. The Peasant Party asked the Russian representatives to meet them from time to time for the arrangement of a joint programme directed towards combating reactionary activities in both countries.
An Anti-Bolshevik Organization.A new organization called the &quot; National Union for tho Defence of the Fatherland and Liberty &quot; has come into being. It will co-ordinate anti-Bolshevik activities and control and arrange insurrectionary move-monts, terrorism and propaganda within and without the Red Army. The Union has an &quot; Ail-Russian &quot; Committee with an executive com-mittee at its head, and is divided into regional committees, government committees, district committees, and town and villago committees, with co-ordinated duties. The district committees aro especially entrusted with the military organization of insurgents, and with the recruiting of sympathisers from the Red Army, by means of propaganda. They deal with the actual formation of fighting units, which are based ou a system of five. Thus tho commander finds company commanders who in turn find five section commanders. Each section commander finds five other ranks. Each unit thus consists of 126 men. Savinkoff would appear to have much to do with the organization. It is reported that so long as Pilsudski remains chief of state, material assistance to Savinkoll&apos; is guaranteed.A Strike Fiasco.The general railway strike ordered for February 28th and March 1st was only partial and was speedily over. There is a tendency to blame Bolsheviks and Germans for tho strike, but tho Government, which ignored the demands made by the railwaymen some time ago, is not altogether without responsibility. An attempt at a general strike was made in Warsaw. It is significant that these strikes were announced by the Soviet Wireless Press 15 days before they occurred. This, say the Poles, was an instruction to the Soviet agents in Warsaw to get to work.Miscellaneous.Jewish-Zionist circles iu Poland arc said to harbour a certain feeling against England on tho ground that England has not given the Jews the&apos; sovereignty in Palestine.As against Bolshevik allegations of inhuman treatment of Russian prisoners of war, the American Y.M.C.A. testifies that in every camp, without exception, the Polish authorities behaved with much humanity towards the prisoners.It is reported that on Constantin Han, an ox-officer of the Ukrainian Gendarmerie, recently arrested at Tarnov, were found documents proving that Petruchevitch has been organizing with the knowledge of the Czcclio-Slovak government an anti-Polish insurrection in Eastern Galicia, arranged to break out during the spring of this year.5. balkan and east european states.GREECE.The Question oi the Land.The peasants, especially iu the North, are much disturbed by the Government revocation of edicts for expropriation of estates. Deputies who are large landowners have asked from Gounaris a promise that the Government would not touch the largo estates. Gounaris could not give a straight answer. The deputies, who number 75, 37 of them Turks, have not decided upon their next stop. Stratos has promised them his help.0 AS 8789
The Government have annulled edicts for 135 estates and checked the machinery of expropriation in the others. It is significant that these estates belong mostly to Royalists, including some members of the Government. The agricultural unions are protesting violently, anil Communism is not unnaturally progressing. A Moslem landowner in Macedonia, expropriated by the last Government, demanded the restitution of his land from the peasants but was threatened with armed opposition. This incident is not likely to be solitary.Labour Troubles.The strike in the beginning of February ended in a few days, but not before it brought out the tramway, gas, electric, and Piroaus Railway workers and the weavers, aud produced threats of general strikes at Athens and Salonica. The men appealed direct to the King, who put pressure on the Government, and a direct arrangement was concluded between the men and tho Government over the heads of tho employers. The tramway company threatened a lock-out, but the Government forced them to agree and the men got all they asked.The action of the Government indicates its policy of forming a party of Royalist workmen who will look to the King rather than to Communism, Anti-Commttuist measures continue. In many districts the police have forbidden the display of the Red flag in processions. The Communists for their part are not displeased, thinking that the men have learnt tho valtto of combined action. Italian propaganda was active in the hope of paralysing industry and showing that the condition of Greece is chaotic ; local Germans were encouraging the men to hold out.In order to break the strike of merchant seamen, called to force Parliament to vote the agreement roached at the International Conference at Genoa, the Government called tho strikers to the colours.JUGO-SLAVIA.Jugo-Slav Communists in Russia are said to number 600, divided into 33 groups. A propaganda school in Moscow is educating 250 agents. Literature is to be smuggled into Jugo-Slavia by Communist agents.The WarsaAv commercial agent of tho Bolsheviks, who is at present in Serbia, is reported to have bought 12,000 French soldiers&apos; coats and 4,500 leather straps. Schapiro has offered to transport these goods via Serbia-Constantinople or Serbia-Stettin.BULGARIA.The Growth of Communism.Stambulisky is reported to have said that there are in Bulgaria only two serious parties the Agrarian Party and the Communists.Tho Communist Party and the General Workers&apos; Syndicalist Alliance are said to be expanding considerably, and movements like that of the Young Communists and the Women&apos;s Communist Organization are-making great progress. Communist leaders, such as Blagoeff, are, however, reported to be discontented with the Communist rank aud file, which, though growing in numbers, does not grow in love for the Third International. Blessed by Moscow as a model party, the Cotn-munists have 45 deputies in the Sobranje. The extreme section, the &quot; Iskra &quot; group, is led by Ivan Gantcheff and renounces parliamentary activities for fear of corrupting its orthodoxy.
The Communist press is said to circulate 98,000 copies against a total of 82,000 copies circulated by the other Bulgarian papers. The organ of the Women&apos;s Communist Organization &quot; Ravenstvo &quot; (Equality) has latterly sold 11,000 copies per issue. Another Communist newspaper, the &quot;Selski Vestuik &quot; (Village Newspaper), which attacks the Agrarian Party in their own territory, has increased its sale during 1920 from 8,000 copies to 14,000, in spite of tho difficulties which it undergoes with the censorship, in common with other extremist organs. A recent issue suggested public readings every Sunday of tho &quot; Solski Vestnik &quot; and other Communist literature.Tho various Communist centres havo sot up educational commissions, and a party school which receives 100 pupils at a time has been opened in Sofia. To this school tho various centres send two members, preferably young men not over 24, for a course of ono month.Tho Broad Socialists, a party standing politically between the Second and Third Internationals, have eight deputies in the Sobrauje. The Communists are gaining at their expense and tho Radicals have absorbed some of their members.Miscellaneous.In the municipal elections at Gabrovo, an important industrial centre, the Communists gained another two seats. They now bold seven out of 14.   At Loin Palenka they maintained their position.The Communists are protesting loudly against the alleged intention of tho Sofia authorities to call up a section of the inhabitants for com-pulsory labour on May 1st, thus spoiling the projected Communist demonstrations.As a counterblast to the recent Communist &quot;Red Month,&quot; the Broad Socialists arranged a &quot; Red Month &quot; of their own. The &quot; Rabotnitche-sky Vestnik&quot; arranged for elaborate returns of tho progress and propaganda made to be returned to it.It was reported on February 7th that the ship &quot; Cyril,&quot; under the Bulgarian flag, was shortly to arrive at Varna from Odessa with guns sent by the Bolsheviks for the Bulgarian Communists.Sakuzoff, leader of the Broad Socialists, and his colleagues Djidrofi and Tzankoff, were the Bulgarian delegates at the recent Pink International in Vienna.A steady increase of Gcrmanophile activities is reported.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY.Relations with Russia and the Turco-Russian Treaty.Whatever divergences of opinion may appear on the surface, there is little reason to doubt the essential unity on matters of policy of Constantinople and Angora. Distrust of Bolshevik Russia, hatred of Greece, and an inclination to Great Britain would seem to be the underlying factors of Turkish policy, both Unionist and Nationalist, to-day. Recent significant incidents demonstrated, even before the London Conference, the mutual dependence, born of necessity, of Angora and Constantinople.The Nationalists had even seriously considered the idea of persuading the Heir Apparent to proceed to Anatolia with a view to his proclamation-mation as Sultan in place of the present Sultan. One significant reason was a desire to conciliate by the presence of an Imperial Prince MoslemE 2
communities whose distrust of the Bolsheviks is growing. The Heir Apparent had previously declared that he agreed in principle with tho idea of joining the Nationalists.The late Talaat Pasha, shortly before his death, also confirme 1 the identity of opinion between Constantinople and Angora, saying that the two were a coalition, with the inevitable differences of a coalition, but with a united national policy.Though it is true that the Rome Conference in January decided that in no case would an aggressive attitude be taken up towards the Soviet, tho Nationalists are in fact filled with serious distrust of Russia. The wisdom of applying Soviet methods to an Oriental population is doubtful after events in Anatolia. Here the administration of tho High Corn-mission of Chiefs was reported in February to be producing a state of Bolshevik terrorism which was making the Nationalist regimo detested, and even undermining the authority of Mustapha Kemal, whose endeavours to check such activities have been unsuccessful. For the rest, restrictions upon personal liberty in Anatolia seem to follow Russian lines. It is unsafe to indulge in private political discussion, and executions are carried out without trial. German influence working in tho Near East in general would not be a mitigating factor ; Anders, of the German Mission in Tiflis, is a personal friend of Enver Pasha, ami his agents appear to co-operate closely with the Bolshevik Intelligence organization.Meanwhile, faced with the necessity of concluding an agreement with Russia, Ali Fund Pasha was instructed in February to adhere to the following principal lines in negotiating with the representatives of the Soviet and Caucasian Governments in Moscow : (a) The Anatolian administration unreservedly recognised the inde-pendenco of the Caucasian Republics, including Armenia.(b) The Anatolian administration agreed to participate in a con-federation of the Caucasian Republics and the Soviet Republic of Russia, provided each Government was allowed complete liberty ol action with regard to its interior policy,and provided no Government would occupy a position of priority or superiority over any other. Whilst claiming that the Govern-nieiits should be free to pursue a policy in conformity with their respective needs, the Nationalist administration was ready to adopt, so far as national and religious tradition permitted, the principles enunciated by the Soviet Government with regard to the rights of the people.(c) The Great National Assembly could not agree to a modificationof the Eastern frontiers in such a manner as to infringe the union of the Turkish nation.Provided these principles were accepted, Ali Fuad Pasha is said to have been instructed that the Nationalists would be prepared for a general offensive and defensive alliance of a military, political, and commercial nature with the Soviet and Caucasian Governments.The very conditional acceptance of the Russian terms embodied in the resultant treaty (signed on March 16th) is to be noted. The treaty states that the two contracting parties, recognising&quot; the kinship between the National and Liberationist movements of the Eastern Peoples and the fight of the workers of Russia for a new social order, formally affirm the right of these people to liberty and independence as well as their right to a Government of their own choosing.The two parties undertake not to recognise any international act imposed by violence to one of the contracting parties. Russia in particu-lar will not recognise any treaty or international act.   The two parties
recognise as null and void all the treaties passed between the two countries before the conclusion of the prosent treaty, Russia considers Turkey to be free of all pecuniary obligations based on past undertakings between Turkey and the Tsarist Government. Russia denounce the regime of the capitulations as incompatible with the sovereignty of any country and declares null and void any right concerning Turkey which is not re-cognised by the National Turkish Government. The two parties decided to defer the definite formulation of the international status of the Black Sea and the Straits to a conference composed of delegates of the bordering states ; the decision of this conference to be without prejudice to tho absolute sovereignly ol&apos; Turkey or the security of this country and of Constantinople. Among other conditions the two parties agreed not to admit in their respective territories the formation or the presence of groups pretending to assume the role of Government of the other country or of part of its territory and to forbid the passage and presence of military and naval forces and of groups hostile to tho other country, as well as any act tending to hostility against tho other country.The treaty is obviously not one founded on mutual good will. When Moscow speaks or writes of the &quot; independence &quot; of peoples lying along its borders it means their emancipation in the bosom of the Third Inter-national. The Turks are as sure in their interpretation of tho word in tho &quot; national &quot; sense, and enter into what they perfectly well know to be a fallacious agreement with Russia only under outside pressure, which concessions by tho Allies with regard to the Treaty of Sevres and a sur-cease of encouragement by any or all of them, of Greek Imperialism in the Eastern Mediterranean would relieve.Previously Tewfik Pasha had seemed to regard favourably the replacement of A limed Mukhtar by Bekir Sami as Nationalist Foreign Commissioner, inasmuch as Bekir Sanii&apos;s experiences in Moscow filled him with a profound disgust of the Bolsheviks and all their ways. As regards peace with the Allies Tewfik&apos;s idea seems to have been that if tho Allies could be persuaded to make certain concessions tho position of the Nationalists would be rendered very difficult, especially if a certain period were allowed for the application of the reconsidered peace conditions, with a proviso that in the event of failure to carry them out they would become null and void.The question of a rapprochment between Great Britain and Turkey seems actually to have been adopted at the conference held at Rome during January but was abandoned owing to tho opposition of the C.U.P. representatives. This decision seems to have been come to mainly from the desire ou the part of the Union to reap the honour and glory of such an understanding rather than that the Nationalists should do so. In fact addressing a U.D.C.-minded British deputation during the conference in London, Osman Nizami, after saying that his deputation had no fault to find with their official reception, but complaining of the attitude of the Press, which always seemed to favour Greece, declared that Turkey never had desired to be upon unfriendly terms with England. They had always looked upon England as their friend and it came as an ugly surprise to them when they felt England was showing hostility. England might in time require the help of Turkey. Another member of tho Delegation remarked that Russia would help Turkey if Turkey was disposed to accept its suggestions, but Russia had ever been their foe and England&apos;s enemy. They would rather help England against the Bolsheviks than have the Bolsheviks help them against England. This primitive partisanship considerably perturbed certain members of the British deputation, including Commander Kenworthy and Mr. Arthur
Field, who hastened to assure their Oriental guests that the friends of Turkey in England were the friends of free (t.e,, Soviet) Russia and the Bolsheviks. Momentarily disconcerted, Eastern sympathy for those mentally afflicted caused the Delegates to receive these improbable assurances with equanimity.Later on in further conversation the Turkish representatives declared that they considered themselves to be true representatives of Turkey and not the other delegation, which they said had no influence outside Constantinople. They were perfectly confident that they could drive the Greeks into the sea, England would get tired of finding money in a hopeless cause. They professed to have had good offers of money and munitions from Russia, but they had no wish to obtain any favours from Russia. They would rather come to an honourable and fair understanding with England, but their minimum was the absolute withdrawal of the Greeks from Thrace, Smyrna, &amp;c, and &quot;thoir hope wtis to get even better terms than that,The rooted distrust of Russia was also sounded at the dinner to the Nationalist Delegation, which was given in London on March 9th. Arnold Luptou acted as host and Bekir Sttnii Bey and other members of his Delegation were present with their stall&apos;. Bekir Sami Boy said he had not come to dictate terms but to obtain justice, lie had been fighting for 20 years, and if justice were denied he and his friends had no altcr-native but to fight on. Yunus Nadi Bey went so far as to say that Turkey was forced to fight against the Allies for one reason only, and that was Russia. Russia was the real enemy. England and Franco were traditionally the friends of Turkey, but for self-preservation Turkey had to fight against Russia, and so against Rttssia&apos;s allies.The Bolsheviks, themselves, would appear to recognise that a break with the Nationalists Avas ultimately inevitable. They are aware that the Turks may having over Moslem sympathies against the Russians, and they are trying to meet this danger by an increasing propaganda in Turkestan aud Persia. The lato Talaat Pasha much disliked Bolshevism and indicated, shortly before bis death, that the Turks Avould only ally themselves with tho Bolsheviks if driven to do so. All the economic forces of Asia Minor, he said, Avero at the disposal of Great Britain. The country Avas rich and cried for development. Groat Britain and Turkey Avere not industrial rivals, but customers needing each other&apos;s wares. The Turks Avould not accept financial or military servitude. With a possible thought of Armenia he hinted that the Irish question had taught us something of the past difficulties that the Turks had bad to face.Mustapha Keinal is reported to have impressed upon a recent secret sitting of the Great National Assembly tho necessity for Turkey to be more than ever on her guard. Anglo-Russian rivalry was entering on a neAV phase in the East. Kemal alleged that the English had invited the Turks to London for the purpose of hastening the conclusion of an alliance with the Russians. As for Nationalist policy Avith regard to Russia, Russia wished to found a Soviet Government in Anatolia, and had financed various committees in the interior of Anatolia. The members of the committees wore known and Avere being secretly tracked doAvn. &quot; There can be no doubt that Russia, under Avhatevor regime she &quot; maybe, has never modified her secular policy or renounced the desire to &quot; attack us on the first opportunity.&quot; Kemal stated that the necessary counter-measures had been taken, and asked for faith and confidence. He foresaw the Russians&apos; attack on Georgia.The Trade Delegation from tho Russian Soviet Government, com-sisting of Communists, and of members of the All-Russian Co-operative Societies, is now established in Constantinople. Its professed object is the purchase of goods for Central Russia ; its members wish to arrange a
conference in Constantinople of Russian Co-operators, who have been invited from Berlin, Vienna, and London. The delegation does not appear to be unduly anxious to start trading, though it is well supplied with funds and credentials. There is little donht that it masks political purposes. Tho Delegation promises raw material in return for goods delivered to Russia. Payment in gold will bo made only in Russia, against goods delivered there. The Delegatiou shows particular anxiety to get into touch with British and American firms.Constantinople and the Nationalists.Izzet Pasha has been describing the pretexts under which ho and his mission were politely imprisoned by Keinal at Angora for over four mouths. One was that his return might endanger Turkish-Bolshevik relations. Under Allied iniluonco he might devise, some coup with Wrangel. Kemal insisted that Turkey must maintain friendly relations with Russia until he was sure that the Entente Powers would alter their attitude to Turkey. Meanwhile Kemal has told the,Angora Parliament that, owing to tho Nationalists&apos; perseverance, the Sevres Treaty does not exist to-day.Communism.Of tho two Bolshevik Committees in Constantinople tho Beikos organization is the older and is officially recognised by Moscow. The chief role here has now been transferred from Silberstein to a Russian Jew named Sirota. A raid by the Greek police has chasteued the Beikos extremists, and they have suspended propaganda, though verbal agitation among local Russian workmen continues successfully. The Constanti-nople Committee, which wants money and official recognition, has tried to come to terms witb the Beikos Committee, but has so far refused the complete subservience demanded as the condition of recognition. The Constantinople Committee has set one Grisha in charge of Russian propaganda, and delegated one Shishman for propaganda among British troops. The committee is in liaison with the so-called Balkan Communist Committee, the Constantinople headquarters of local Bulgarian Bolsheviks.In mid-February the Tiflis newspaper &quot; Shefak &quot; stated that the president of the Russian Turkish Communist Party, Mustapha Subhi, with 16 other Turkish comrades, left Baku at the beginning of January on a propaganda tour in Anatolia. They were very ill received. At Erzerum they had to find accommodation outside the town ; at Trebizond their arrival so excited the population that the police had to be reinforced by cavalry and infantry. In the end the disgruntled delegation left hurriedly, having achieved none of its aims. The complicity of its president and members in the massacres committed by the Bolsheviks in Turkestan and other Moslem countries of Russia may have had some connection with the feeling shown.Miscellaneous.The French Government has informed General Wrangel that it is unable any longer to maintain the Russian Army at Constantinople. Three alternatives are suggested : (1) Return to Russia provided an amnesty is obtainable from the Soviet Government; (2) emigration to South America ; (3) service in tho French Foreign Legion. Wrangel has meanwhile sent out an appeal, addressed especially to America, to save the last anti-Bolshevist army from dissolution.
In a raid on the Bolshevist centre in Stambul Allied police seized a quantity of propaganda literature, money, and correspondence with Moscow. The dozen individuals arrested included Adamof, a dangerous anarchist from Moscow.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES. ARMENIA.The success of the Dashnak revolt, was short-lived aud the Reds soon recaptured Erivan, indulging in savage reprisals and restoring Soviet Government in the major part of Armenia, The national revolt in the Zanguezur appears to continue.GEORGIA.With the capture of Kutais, the last foothold of the overthrown Georgian Government, Georgia has become completely Bed.The Turks remaining in Batum declined Bolshevik proposals for a joint occupation and issued a proclamation announcing the reversion of Batum to Turkey. The capture of Bop, however, had cleared the way for the Beds. The Georgian Government appears to have received Bolshevism and turned upon (ho Turks. Fighting between the Turks and the remains of the Georgian army ended in tho expulsion of the Turks from Batum, which has been damaged and sovietised. Meanwhile, under the recently signed Russo-Turkish Treaty, Batum is ceded to Georgia under the condition of local autonomy. Indications aro appearing that if they consolidate their position in Trans-Caucasia the Bolsheviks will advance towards Trebizond and Erzerum.The British Trades Union Congress has sent a telegram of sympathy to the Georgian Socialists ou the occasion of the Bolshevik invasion.TURKESTAN.The &quot;Pravda &quot; asserts that there is no more hope of a counter-revolu-tionary movement in Khiva, where the Soviet is organizing trade unions and putting agrarian laws into practice, while the &quot;Rosta&quot; publishes papers iu Russian and Turkoman.There was some talk about tho beginning of January of tho Soviet Governments appointing one Gashkevitch to organise military affairs in arming tho population in Bokhara. Gashkevitch was to havo a staff of instructors export in the native languages. Ho was to carry on his work only under the direction of the revolutionary committee, tho local political situation being kept well in view.AFGHANISTAN.Suritz, the Soviet envoy at Kabul, has been complaining of the non-fulfilment of Moscow&apos;s promises of funds, and has committed himself to some of Djemal Pasha&apos;s projects, which he is now no longer able to finance. Latterly Djemal Pasha&apos;s activities appear to havo been finding scant favour with Suritz at Kabul and with the Foreign Office at Moscow. Djemal was, indeed, being deceived both by tho Bolshevik office at Tashkent and by Suritz, and appears to havo been led to believe in Bolshevik units with tho Pamirs and Bolshevik wireless stations and representatives, which had no existence in fact.
PIMahendra Nath Roy&apos;s Bolshevik Indians, equipped with Bolshevik funds for working expenses, duly arrived in Kabul early in January. They made a present of their funds to the Amir, and proceeded to sponge upon Suritz, the local Bolshevik representative, for a living. Suritz requested Moscow to send no more Indians without consulting him, aud demanded that any sent should be put under his orders and given no funds.On March 3rd Moscow announced that the treaty between Russia aud Afghanistan had been signed on February 28th at Moscow. The treaty recognises the independence of Afghanistan, compatible with an annual subsidy from Soviet Russia of 1,000,000 roubles in gold or silver. Afghanistan recognises the independence of Bokhara and Khiva ; Russia agrees to return such territories taken by the Tsarist Government from Afghanistan as desire re-union with Afghanistan. The contracting parties bind themselves not to enter with a third power into a military or political agreement detrimental to one of the contracting parties. The Amir&apos;s communications to Mo?cow appear to have made a favourable impression, and Rosenberg, late Chief of the Propaganda Branch in the Soviet Foreign Office, was despatched to Kabul about February 20th for tho ratification of the agreement between Soviet Russia and Afghanistan.8. far eastern states. siberia.Reports of peasant insurrections which took place in the last Aveeks of 1920 continue to arrive. Tho peasants have realised that they are faced Avith economic and political slavery. The first rising in the Altaisk Government Avas mercilessly suppressed, but thousands of peasants escaped into the Taiga, the forest of Siberia, Avhere they are preparing a fresh attack. A number of other insurrections followed upon the Altaisk rising, but each Avas independent aud consequently easily suppressed. The survivors from these insurrectionary forces fled into the Taiga, where tho total number of peasant troops iioav amounts to 45,000. The tribal population, Avhich has the same interests as the peasantry, is also preparing a spring campaign. The peasants appear to have learnt the necessity for organisation and are now organising their own union. Democratic elements in the Far East have formed a Military Revolutionary Committee to support the peasants, but the Avork of this Committee is likely to be hindered by lack of funds.Reports of Japanese policy are conflicting. Political circles in Japan are considered by the Bolsheviks to favour the evacuation of Siberia, but the Japanese military party is aggressive. Moscoav and Chita are devising a scheme to attract Japanese commercial interests to Siberia so as to prevent aggressive action from Tokio. Japanese merchants are, however, very cautious, and before delivering goods require to see tho raw materials and money to be given in payment.Late in February there Avere signs of German activities in Trans-baikalia. A certain F. Fisher approached the German Minister at Tokio with a request for repatriation, stating that be had been acting for the German Foreign Office in the Far Eastern Republic, in whoso interest he desired to go to Berlin to establish political and economic relations.   He did not impress the German Minister favourably.It is reported that the U.S.A. will be ready, provided certain guaran-tees to American capital are given, to recognise any Siberian State
which can be called democratic, without inquiring too curiously who really hold sway. Tho difficulties of American capitalists in placing their capital and anti-Japanese feeling are said to actuate this policy. A press campaign in defence of the new Government could be arranged in the U.S.A.china.A situation very unfavourable to China is reported to be developing in Mongolia. It appears that the llutukhtu (tho Living Buddha) was crowned King of Mongolia on February 25th, ami the independence of the country proclaimed. Meanwhilo, Mongolian forces, marching south-ward, have occupied Ude, in the middle of the Gobi Desert, but a Mongol invasion of China is unlikely. Tho Mongols wish to be rid of tho Chinese soldiery and to restore the relationships of the Kiakhta Convention, which gave Mongolia practical independence. The embarrassment of the finances and the unwillingness of the military governors to employ their forces in Mongolia seem to make impossible serious efforts by the Chinese to rectify tho situation. The commander of the Mongol Army is Baron llngern, who is suspected of being in communication with many of semenoff&apos;s officers now refugees in China. Ungern is strongly anti-Bolshevik and may attempt to use Mongolia as a base against the Reds. Nothing has come hitherto of the proposals of the Chita Government that China should let them join in a combined attack upon Ungern.The Soviet Mission to Pekin has failed and the Chinese Government is reported finally to have decided not to receive a Soviet Trade Delegation. The snub is reported to have resulted in an acrid note from Tchitcherine detailing damages caused by China to tho Soviet Republic. Meanwhile Moscow is strengthening its forces on the Russo-Chinesc frontier.9. british colonies. canada.Unemployment.On the whole unemployment appears to be less menacing. Various industries are reopening and fishery has improved. Unemployment has, in fact, lost its ugliness as a police problem, and would-be revolutionaries are raging at the disposition of workmen to look for work rather than trouble. The prospects for the coming season are reported to be good. Food is plentiful and there is no scarcity of fuel.In Montreal, however, unemployment was reported early hi March to be growing more acute. The French Communist Party and the One Big Union were doing their utmost to create trouble and discord in order to persuade the unemployed to resort to violence ; the agitators themselves, however, are careful to remain in the background,In Vancouver the Committee of Unemployed has been dissolved and a &quot; Council of Action &quot; created in its stead. The unemployed, of whom there are a considerable number, show signs of their inclination to listen to extremist agitators. Though the men who downed tools because the Canadian Pacific Railway reduced wages have been refused city relief, any real demonstration on the part of labour is improbable as the unemployed are unorganised, while organised labour is split up into different factions.
-   251In February an obstinate deadlock was reached in tho strike between the Dominion Steel Company and their employees. A notice was issued by the company that men holding out after February 15th would no longer be regarded as employees, and those living in houses owned by tho company would be subject to ejection, in order to make room for the now workers.A serious struggle is predicted at the beginning of May between the united employers and united labour. The latter intends to tight to the utmost the proposed reduction of wages and increase of working hours, while the employers insist that the exorbitant labour rales must be curtailed. The Master Builders&apos; Associations state that excessive waues, short hours,and deliberate curtailment of production through malingering have caused the prevailing acute house shortage, and insist that a change is imperative, In large centres such as Montreal and Toronto both parties are preparing for the light, though on the whole, especially in the maritime provinces, the men aro meanwhile accepting the cut in wages as inevitable.The Amalgamated Clothing Makers of Hamilton have accepted the manufacturers&apos; 15 per cent, reduction in wages, while the union has been recognised by the firms. Unfortunately the rank and tile are dissatisfied with the result, and have determined that &quot; the bosses shall not benefit by the cut in prices.&quot;The Loggers and the One Big Union.The loggers&apos; secession from the One Big Union in February is not altogether satisfactory, as it is feared that with a free hand to guide its own affairs not only may the Lumber Workers&apos; Industrial Union become more militant, but it will also have more money with which to finance strikes, &amp;c. An effort is to be made to persuade the miners to join the organisation, and to amalgamate all the camp workers of the coast. The Lumber Workers&apos; Union may join tho Industrial Workers of the World.Communism.Although no official party has been launched, tho organisation of the Communist Party in Western Ontario is proceeding apace. At present some of the groups are doubtful as to whether they will join the Third International, chiefly on opportunist grounds. Altogether Communists in Western Canada number about 6,000, and many labour organisations are infiltrated. It is not improbable that the One Big Union may pass completely into the control of the Communist Party, and even in Inter-national unions Communist elements arc to be found.The French Communist Party has now decided to work openly instead of underground as before in Montreal. Their avowed intention is to bring about Soviet rule in Canada.In Toronto tho United Communist Party and the Communist Party continue to work separately. All members of the Workmen&apos;s Circle, or the Arbeiter Ring, are believed to be adherents of the Communist Party.The Independent Labour Party is reported to be short of funds. The leaders are said to be using their position to urge their socialist ideas rather than to help the mass of labour.The United Communist Party in Toronto is said to include seven underground groups, while in Hamilton it has captured tho Workers&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Federation, and has succeeded in placing members of the party .n all the offices of tho Federation. War has been declared on all sane labour leaders, who are denounced as &quot;labour fakirs &quot; in accordance with-1 7
the Moscow plan. Several of the revolutionary bodies in Montreal form units of the general Communist organisation. So far the United Com-muuist Party has not appeared in the west, and in places like Vancouver and Edmonton the Socialist Party of Canada are leisurely discussing the question of affiliation with the Third International. In Vancouver the balance of opinion is in favour of pursuing an opportunist course.The Dominion Civil Servants are to be organised on an O.B.U. footing, with a permanent committee residing in Ottawa. The appeal of the Socialist Party of Canada for members has met with little response in spite of its recent reorganisation.A mischievous movement is on foot in Vancouver to form a Canadian National Union of ex-Sorvice men on the same lines as the British organisation. A violent revolutionary from Australia, named Franklin, has arrived in Vancouver. He is one of a number of radicals, whose movement across the Pacific has been noticed of late. Franklin is apparently connected with various rabid reds in Sydney. He brought with him ft considerable quantity of literature.A tour of inspection has recently been made iu Eastern Canada by an important member of the American Central Executive of the United Communist Party. In Buffalo his stay was sufficiently long to allow him to organise machinery for smuggling seditious reading matter into Canada. Later, ho is to visit Mexico ; that country, with Canada, apparently is bracketed by the Communist headquarters as outlying regions to be organised. The formation of a Canadian-Mexican Party to operate through the Pan-American Bureau is said to be contemplated.Symptomatic of the tight hand which the central organisation intends to keep on Canadian Communists is the way in which the breach between the &quot; United Communist Parly11 and the &quot;Communist&quot; Party in Toronto has been healed ; undoubtedly stronger aud abler minds are now in control.The reported attempt to form a Red Union of railwaymen is evidently inspired from abroad, as it accords with the movement in Europe to organise a Red Trade Union International. In Ontario the craft unions aro threatening reprisals on account of the propaganda meeting of the Machinists&apos; Union in Hamilton having been broken up by the Com-munists in accordance with that portion of the 21 points which enjoins war upon trade unions. The Ontario organisation, however, is reported to bo short of funds, a day&apos;s pay is being demanded nearly every month, to the indignation of its adherents.A chain of underground locals is to be formed throughout Canada and the United States. Negotiations were recently opened by W. Paul, the &quot; Red &quot; organiser among the Russians ant! Ukrainians, with some of tho English-speaking revolutionaries with a view to opening an under-ground communist local among English-speaking extremists. His foreign groups, he stated, are affiliated, through Bell, with the United Com-munist Party in the United States.The germ cell system is evidently being organised in Hamilton and other places by agitators, one of whom is a young Ukrainian and another a Bulgarian, who uses the name of Mitchell. The latter visited Seminoff, one of the four men charged with belonging to an unlawful association when in Hamilton.A new red labour union, called the United Association of Railroad Employees of North America is being promoted by the Secretary of the Plebs&apos; League in Toronto, apparently in connection with the present outlaw strike in the United States.
SOUTH AFRICA.Early in March work ceased in all Rhodesian mines where notice ha-d been received from the mine owners demanding the workers&apos; recognition of their right to engage non-union miners. Early negotiations proved fruitless, and a long stoppage was anticipated.German recalcitrancy in Europe is having its effect in the South-West Protectorate, where German papers are waxing wroth over the reparations. The tendency to jeer at the mandate is becoming marked aud the prospect is unpromising.In December 1920, the South African Young Socialist League sought admission to the Communist Juvenile International. The League will, if the delegates arrive in time at the meeting place, send representatives to the World Congress of the Juvenile Proletariat Revolutionaries, the recent advance of which movement it hails as one of the most impartant successes in the South African Juvenile movement. Reporting to the &quot; Internationale Jugendkorrespondenz,&quot; the League states that the Communist movement in South Africa is still in its infancy, that it is weak and that progress is slow. The movement is at present confined to three large towns in which there are groups of comrades carrying on active propaganda. It is in the main confined to the white population, and is only now gaining adherents among the natives and coloured workers. The two organisations in South Africa are the &quot; International Socialist League,&quot; centred in Johannesburg with one group in Durban, aud the agitation and Foreigners.A number of foreign agitators have, entered the Hydro Concentration Camps at Niagara Falls and Queens town in order to organise a strike in May or June next, and are busy spreading the report of &quot; the Company&apos;s &quot; intention to cut wages. The men, however, are sick of strikes, ami the agitation does not prosper.A number of exceptionally seditious speeches on conditions in India have been mado in Winnipeg by Dr. Nana S. Hardiker, the Hindu agitator.The Russian Workers&apos; School, with Dodokin tit its head, has developed into the regular anarchist headquarters in Toronto, aud repudiates the dictatorship of Bolshevism,Non-revolutionary Ukrainian bodies are no longer to be allowed the use of halls controlled by the Ukrainian Labour Temple convention, Whether the latter is controlled by Moscow or not, it undoubtedly agrees with the injunctions of the 21 points. At a meeting of tho Society, during an address on European diplomacy, the speaker insisted thai an Anglo-American war was in sight, He credited America with a plan to seize Canada to defray the debt owed by Great Britain. lie also declared that the United States and Japan were being egged on to alight by Great Britain.Proceedings instituted by certain local Chinese against one Chin Dai Hong have led to the discovery of the existence of a syndicate formed in Vancouver about the end of 1920 for the purpose of smuggling arms into China in exchange for liquor and drugs. A subsequent raid on Chinese promises resulted in the seizure of a large quantity of liquor, drugs, also some rifles aud ammunition. Apparently arrangements had also been made to purchase rifles in the United States for shipment to China.
Communist Party, centred in Cape Town with one group in Johannes-burg. There are two newspapers circulated in South Africa, the organ of the &quot; International Socialist League,&quot; a weekly edition called &quot; The International,&quot; and the &quot; Bolshevik,&quot; the official monthly paper of this party.Colour hostility in the population is set down as a disadvantage for Communist propaganda. The movement is, nevertheless, continuing, although Communist teachings among the natives and coloured workers encounter Government opposition in the mines organisation, so that Communists expect anti-Bolshevik laws to bo passed iu the next Parliamentary session.The condition of tho Labour movement is reflected in the Young Socialist movement, which is also weak and scattered.AUSTRALIA.Arrangements havo been made to launch a Communist Party of Australia which will probably affiliate with the Third International. Its manifesto allows parliamentarism for revolutionary purposes, and &apos;1 does not exclude from its ranks those holding contrary views, pro-viding that they submit to party discipline.&quot; The new party has been repudiated by the Australian Labour Party and Socialist Labour Party, the latter claiming that not only is it &quot;unscientific,&quot; but that it provides an excellent cover under which police spies and agents provocateurs can work to the detriment of the workers.A vigorous protest against immigration has been made by some of the Labour organisations. Under tho new scheme it is estimated that several million ex-Service men, with women and dependents in Great Britain, are eligible for a free passage, and it is hoped that many will be absorbed into the rural life of the Commonwealth.Bolshevist publications in English emanating from Australia are being distributed in Dutch New Guinea among bundles of unobjeclion-able reading matter distributed by sailors from ships arriving from Australia.Irish propaganda is being carried on with great vigour, almost entirely by people of Irish origin, some of tho most bitter being Australian-born of Irish parentage.Tho Victorian Government has dismissed two Australian railwaymen who moved and seconded a motion describing the soldiers who shot the Mallow railwaymeu as &quot; hired assassins.&quot;WEST INDIES.Emigration to Cuba has disorganised labour, and only temporarily relieved unemployment. The number of arrivals now exceeds the departures. Success in obtaining higher wages has tended to promote unreasonable demands, and at present employers are compelled to pay for inferior labour at a rate of wages from 100 to 300 per cent, higher than pre-war rates.While in the country parishes the old friendly relations between the white and coloured races prevail, things in Kingston and its immediate surroundings are &quot; uncomfortable.&quot; Most of the inhabitants, however, have enough sense not to show racial antipathy and disturb friendly relations of a patriarchal nature.
10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Capital and Labour.The struggle between capital and labour, it appears, cannot be much longer delayed. A serious attempt is being made by the employers to destroy the power of the labour unions and thus destroy the tyranny of labour. Above all, employers wish to break the ironclad rule of tho &quot; closed shop,&quot; whereby American labour unions refuse to allow union and non-union men to work side by side. &quot;Open shops&quot; are stigmatised by the unions in their official publications as &quot; unfair,&quot; They aro boy-cotted whenever possible, and every effort is made to harm them. During the war Labours demand for wages and shorter hours increased by leaps and bounds ; with every increase of wages and decrease of hours it became more inefficient and less productive. Existing economic eon-ditions undoubtedly favour the employers in their fight ; although they do not openly acknowledge their intention to break the unions and mtiko &quot;open shop&quot; universal, there is no disguising their real purpose. In certain cases where employers made individual contracts with their men prohibiting them from joining the unions, the unions, ignoring these contracts, have sent their organisers into the districts to secure members. Recently, however, the Supreme Court of tho United States upheld the; validity of these contracts and issued an injunction prohibiting the unions from seeking to induce tho men to violate their contracts by joining the union. The Labour leaders are disturbed by the decision, and are endeavouring to secure tho passage of a law permitting them to join unions despite any individual contract to tho contrary.In view of the growth of the Open Shop movement, Mr. Gompers has summoned a meeting of tho 109 unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labour in order, if possible, to contend against it. It must lie remembered that in America the trade unions have not the same hold on the workers that they have in Great Britain. Strike-breakers are always given ample protection by the police and by State and Govern-ment troops, while &quot;picketing&quot; during strikes, having been declared illegal, is always punished if attempted.Moderate counsels appear to lie prevailing with the Industrial Workers of the World in consequence of the power of injunction vested in the Executive, backed as it is by public opinion. All advocacy of violence or of the overthrow of government by force is being eliminated from Industrial Workers of the World propaganda, and the doctrine of &quot; sabotage&quot; has been definitely abandoned.A telegram was sent to President Harding from the emergency con-: ference of tho American Federation of Labour expressing disapproval of the appointment of a business man as Secretary of Labour.Unemployment and Strikes.Although in New England some of the leading industries have been somewhat more active, on the whole there has been an increase, of unemployment, especially in the South and West. In New York State the increase has been about 4 per cent. Plants are being shut down and industries curtailed in many districts and wage reductions are taking, place steadily throughout the country. In the case of 100,000 textile mill workers in New England the reduction has averaged 22 per cent. Between December 15th and January 15th the number of unemployed in 182 of the largest cities was 1,802,755.
A big strike of over 200,000 people is predicted on account of the decision of the big packers, such as Armour &amp; Co., to cut wages by 12^ per cent, and to abolish the eight-hour day,The Senate has rejected the Immigration Bill proposing a total ban on immigration for one year and substituted a Bill restricting immigra-tion to 5 per cent, of the persons of each nationality resident in the country according to the last census. Citizens of Japan, China, Canada, Newfoundland, Cuba, Mexico, Central and South America are exempted from the provisions of this law. An adequate supply of labour for the fanners is necessary, but greater discrimination iu immigration at the source and at the port of arrival is to bo exercised.The Railway Crisis.A strike against the reduction of wages has been declared by 21,500 employees of the railways in Georgia. Tho railwaymen generally are very restive in spite of expert assurances that it is absolutely necessary for the railways to reduce wages if bankruptcy is to be avoided.Large reductions in stall&quot; have already been made, and it is reported that more than 200,000 railroad workers are idle. A reduction of 20 per cent, in operating cost from the expenses in November 1920, when 35,000 men wore dismissed, is announced by Peiinsylvanian lines. The railroads have asked for the abrogation of the national agreements and for permission to hire track labourers, of whom there are over 500,000 at the wage scale prevailing in the localities where the men are employed. The companies object especially to tho abolition of piece-work and the bonus rule, whereby if a worker duo to report at 8 a.m. &quot;punches in &quot; at 7.59 a.m. he is entitled to pay for one extra hour for the week. These &quot; extra hours &quot; during which no work is done cost tho companies, it is estimated, approximately $250,000,000 per annum. The only actual reduction contemplated is for common labour ; for the rest there will bo no reduction in the wage scale for 90 days contingent upon the abolition of the national agreements. The Railway Brotherhood are fighting strenuously against their abolition. On the whole a conciliatory spirit is evident on both sides and it is hoped that a compromise may bo reached which, while allowing tho companies to substantially cut the present excessive costs, may yet give the men a satisfactory advance over normal wages.Tho railway unions appreciate the gravity of declaring a railway strike and have decided to appeid first to President Harding and the Railway Labour Board. The Cabinet has meanwhile discussed the situation and President Harding has made it clear that he hopes to bring about a reduction in both wages (a 10 per cent, minimum) and rates by Congressional action if necessary, aud urged the companies to practise the most rigid economy.The National Association of Railway Executives has decided to abolish its labour committee, asserting that &quot; its further maintenance was &quot; a constant invitation to seek a uniform settlement of labour matters &quot; which ought to be settled between each railroad and its own employees.&quot; National boards of adjustment are also to be avoided by the Association.Communists and Socialists.It; is reported that Communist couriers are travelling between Holland and America, one of them with special instructions from Wynkoop to the American Communist Party concerning arrangements for an American and International meeting of Communists in the United States,
In a statement issued by the Socialist Party of New York, it is reported that there are in the U.S.A. no less than 12 definite Labour groups, such as the Socialist Party, Socialist Labour Party, Communist Party, United Communist Party, and Proletarian Party, besides a number of non-afliliated groups, of which the majority are foreign. An attempt is being made to unify seven of those groups. Tho Communists have failed in their aim of becoming the leading party in Labour, after their secession from the Socialists two years ago.The Bolshevist press in tho United States is almost entirely manned from the world headquarters of the Third International.Relations with Russia.All restrictions on trade with Russia having their origin in war legis-lation have been removed by the Department of Stato with the exception of the War Trade Board regulations controlling the shipment of munitions aud war material to Soviet Russia. Confidential instructions have been issued to the Director of the Mint warning him against tho acceptance through the Mints or Assay Offices of gold &quot;to which any possible suspicion of Soviet origin arises.&quot; &quot;Gold bearing the official coinage or &quot; mint stamp of the Government of Great Britain, France, or other &quot; recognised nations with which the United States is not technically at &quot; war will bo considered as free from any suspicion or possibility of &quot; Soviet origin, and therefore as not falling within any of the above &quot; classes.&quot; This decision has been made on account of the notices received by the Treasury that action may be taken challenging the title to such gold, and it is probable that this policy of the Treasury will be maintained unless the matter is thrown into the American courts and the title definitely decided by them.The larger policy of the United States is expressed in a message to the Soviet representative at Reval from Mr. Hughes, Secretary of State. This expresses sympathy with the Russian people, but states that &quot; it is &quot; idle to expect resumption of trade until the economic basis of production &quot; is securely established. If fundamental changes are contemplated &quot; involving due regard for the protection of persons and property and the &quot; establishment essential to the maintenance of commerce this Govorn-&quot; ment will be glad to have convincing evidence of the consummation of &quot; such changes, and until such evidence is supplied this Government is &quot; unable to perceive that there is any proper basis for considering trade &quot; relations.&quot; The suggestion made in certain quarters that before any trade agreement is made with Soviet Russia an acknowledgment of American claims of over 350,000,000 dollars will be insisted upon by the new administration, is to be received with caution.The Far Eastern Republic proposes to send a mission to the United States to negotiate a trade agreement. It is prepared to guarantee the inviolability of private property, free trade, and the open door, and wishes to grant concessions to Americans for mining, railway, and other enterprises.So far it has not been possible to verify the vague reports that the Soviet Government is attracting to Russia technical workers, such as electricians, from the States, but a fairly circumstantial account of overtures to a scientist has been somewhat sceptically, however i received. The story goes that a bacteriologist has been asked to go to Russia as professor of chemistry, the inducements held out being a liberal salary (in roubles), free lodging, medical attendance, theatres, &amp;c, a strong hint being given that his duties might include preparing disease germs for dissemination.   This, however, he is reported to have refused.0 as 8789 F
Forty-two anarchists who went to Russia in the hope of finding there a workers&apos; Eldorado are returning sadder but wiser, finding that Lenin and Trotsky have reinstituted slavery.The New York &quot;Association Unity of Russia&quot; is directed not only against Bolsheviki, but also against &quot; other treacherous and destructive Socialist groups.&quot;The Sinn Fein Campaign.The Irish-inspired boycott of British goods is assuming serious pro-portions. A long list of firms and articles has been blacklisted in a circular by the &quot; \Voinen&apos;s Irish Education League.&quot; British tea companies are the latest additions to the list, the sole exception being the Salada Tea Company, whose former manager was a German, retained on the pay-roll throughout his internment, and whose present manager, a man named Larkin, born in Canada, has pronounced Irish proclivities.A company with a large capital is being organised by a Mr. B. 0&apos;Byrne, an insurance man, for the purpose of buying raw material in America and sending it to Germany for manufacture, after which the finished articles will be returned to America. Thousands of Irish work-men are to be employed in these German factories, a number of whom are already in Germany spreading propaganda in favour of Ireland.The Sinn Fein agitation does not, however, have things all its own way, and there are signs of a rovulsion against it. The proprietor of the &quot; New York Times,&quot; who has recently visited England, has expressed his conviction that the agitation promoted by German propagandists was likely to defeat its own ends as the American people resent tho way in which the Germans are exploiting the Irish question to increase tho difficulties of Great Britain.An enormous demonstration has been held in New York by &quot; One hundred per cent. Americans &quot; to protest against the efforts of Sinn Fein and German Americanism &quot; Deufschland Go Bragh &quot; to undermine the moral foundation of the country&apos;s participation in the war and to sow dissension between the Allies. A resolution was paBsed condemning the spread of mischievous propaganda and resenting as disloyal &quot; any &quot; attempt to spread dissension in our country against the Allies who &quot; fought shoulder to shoulder with us for the preservation of human &quot; liberty in the greatest war of all times.&quot;A society known as the Loyal Coalition has been founded to fight Sinn Fein in America.Efforts are being made by the Catholic Church Extension Society in America to separate the Indian and Egyptian aspirations from those of Ireland, Sinn Fein propaganda in the United States having proved detrimental to the Catholic cause.During a lecture at NeAv York Sir Philip Gibbs rebuked the Irish American Roman Catholic clergy for their systematic efforts to promote strife between the United States and Great Britain. Not only, he said, were they playing with hell fire, but they were doing the Irish cause much harm.   His remarks were received with great applause.Jeremiah 0&apos;Leary has prepared a film with a thrilling plot depicting alleged British atrocities in Ireland. Ho intends to arrange illustrated lectures to further the boycott of English goods and insurance companies.Miscellaneous.It is reported that Hugo Stinnes is sending a representative to America in April to negotiate the purchase of a number of papers for
Germau and anti-English propaganda purposes. Strenuous effects are already being made to crush British propaganda by various papers.A negro named Claude McKay, formerly the right-hand man of Sylvia Pankhurst in connection with the &quot; Dreadnought,&quot; has reached New York, where he appears to have been received with open arms by the Radicals.   He is now working for the &quot;Liberator.&quot;Anti-French and pro-German propaganda is to be spread in the United States in connection with a secret society recently organised for the same purpose iu Alsace-Lorraine.11. central american states. mexico.Feeling between the Spanish speaking delegates and the Americans was apparent at the meeting of the Pan-American Federation of Labour held iu Mexico City in January last. Mr. Gompors was re-elected (in spite of opposition) by a solid American, Porto Rican and Santo Domingau vote, aud a resolution opposed by the delegates from the United States and Porto Rica was passed to provide Immigration Agencies in all Latin-American countries for the collection aud dissemi-natiou of information regarding labour condition.12. south american states. argentine.The anarchy so long prevalent appears to have at length aroused the authorities. Sanction has been requested from Congress for the institution and maintenance of a national gendarmerie of 3,000 men, with officers aud staffs, to be distributed iu units of 300 strong in the 10 national territories. In Santa Cruz, meetings, the carrying of arms, or circulation in the streets after 9 p.m. have been forbidden. A fresh series of strikes with violence in the Forestal Company&apos;s area in the Chaco have been met by the despatch of police reinforcements and regular troops at the request of the local authorities. These measures seem the more necessary, inasmuch as one of the predatory gangs is said to number 500 strong, and an Estancia of 30 leagues of land belonging to the well-known Menendez Company has been pillaged and the wool sheds destroyed by fire.The conflict between the Mihauovitch company and the Maritime Works Federation having been settled by agreement, passenger services on Parana and Paraguay, Upper Paraguay, and Uruguay River lines were resumed on March 20th after being suspended for over a year.In the Argentine the excitement aroused by McSweeney&apos;s death appears to have been evanescent. Threats of violence and boycott did not materialise. In the absence of the anticipated lead from the United States sympathy for the cause disappointed the efforts of the Irish propagandist papers.A book entitled &quot; Libro Verde de Irlanda &quot; (&quot; Tho Green Book of Ireland &quot;), based on answers to a questionnaire issued by the &quot; Comite Argentino Pro Libertad de Irlanda,&quot; has recently seen the light.The firm of Krupps has succeeded in obtaining a contract for the supply of 10,000 steel wheels, their quotation being only 49 gold pesos 60 centavos against 70, 74, and 118 gold pesos per wheel asked by 14 American, British, and German factories.F 2
I6SCHILE.The labour situation is becoming grave, anil in the North Bolshevism is reported to be largely responsible. Urged by well-known Soviet agitators, the workers are getting out of hand. Unemployment, caused chiefly by the closing down of nitrate factories and mines is aggravating matters, despite the large sum voted by the Government for its relief. Public meetings at which the men are incited to disorder are frequent. Were the authorities, including the President, to hear some of the open sedition publicly preached, including threats against themselves, they would be less prone than they are to pander to the men.In February the disturbances in Antofagasta province culminated in an attack on the &quot; oficina &quot; of Messrs. Gibbs &amp; Co. After the Anglo-Chilian manager of the works, the subaltern in command of the military picket sent to protect them and 70 workmen had been killed and many wounded, the picket retired, leaving the property in the hands of looters. Troops despatched to the disturbed area and a cruiser stationed at the port restored calm.
mPART II.1. THE EFFECT OF THE PEASANT RISINGS IN SOVIET RUSSIA.The mouth oi&apos; March will he memorable in the history of Soviet Russia as that in which the Soviet Government made the first serious admission of fundamental defects in its application of the Communist system of government. Tn his report on taxation at the Tenth Con-gress of the Russian Communist Party Lenin said : &quot;To preserve the &quot; power of the proletariat with the peasants against us and with tho &quot; world revolution slowing down is a sheer impossibility, simply for &quot; economic reasons we will have to give it up. This must be clearly &quot; understood by everybody and fearlessly expressed.&quot; &quot;The mutual &quot; relations,&apos;&apos; he proceeded, &quot; between the workmen and peasants deter-&quot; mine the fate of our whole revolution. We must try and satisfy the &quot; demands of the peasants who are justifiably discontented. The small &quot; farmer must be allowed a certain liberty in effecting exchange. Local &quot; exchange is permissible. Then if this exchange provides the State &quot; with a quantity of grain sufficient to supply the requirements of the &quot; town and industries, economic circulation will be re-established, and &quot; State authority consolidated.&quot;&quot;In order to keep power more firmly in tho hands of the proletariat &quot; we must satisfy the middle peasants economically and agree to the &quot; freedom of exchange. Free circulation of goods is an incentive for &quot; the peasants to increase their sowing area and improve their farms, &quot; as all their surplus goods will not bo taken from them but only a &quot; tax in kind, which will, whenever possible, lie determined in advance. &quot; We must build up our State economy to correspond with the economy &quot; of the middle peasant, which we have not been able to change &quot; during the last three years.&quot;After hearing Lenin&apos;s report the Congress passed resolutions replacing the levy as a means of supplying the State with foodstuffs, iuw material and fodder by taxation in kind, such taxation to be estimated to cover the minimum requirements of the army, town and agricultural workers and to be gradually decreased as the restoration of transport and industry enabled the Soviet authority to obtain agricultural products by normal means.* The tax. will be levied in the form of a percentage of the produce of the farms, taking into consideration the harvest, the number of consumers on the farm and actual quantities of live stock. It will be on a sliding scale. The amounts to be deducted from the farms of the middle and poor peasants and farms of town workers will be decreased so that the farms of the poorest peasants may in some exceptional cases even be entirely exempt. Rewards tending towards exemption will also bo given to farms and peasants increasing the sowiug area or output of their farms. Village unions will be the principal collecting agents and supplies of foodstuffs and raw material retained by the owner after the tax lias been paid are entirely under his own control to improve and strengthen his farm, use for his personal requirements and exchange for articles produced by factories, works and peasant craft industries.In fact the peasants&apos; surplus crop will no longer be subject torequisi-tioning.   Till now the Soviet Government has let each peasant family* Presumably hinting at an ultimate reversion in more favourable circumstances to the levy.
eep only enough food for itself and has appropriated the rest for distribution. Henceforward the Government is to levy only a tax taken u kind. The increase due to its labour remains with the family. After paying a strictly graduated tax to the organs of the State for the industrial workers and other non-agricultural elements the peasant pro-proprietor will bo free to barter his surplus for commodities in the open market. In short, after three years of invective and abuse, profiteering has come into its own, and the principle of individual property is recog-nised as far as the agricultural population is concerned.No change could be more striking or more far-reaching. If, from whatever motive, it is genuine in inception and lasting in application the alteration cannot but mean that Russia, while still in theory isolating herself in Communism, has at last turned her face towards the comity of capitalist States. Both the causes and the effects of an event so epoch-making are worthy of exploration.The causes are not far to seek. Lenin has yielded to the stress of circumstance. His doing so indicates no change of heart or of will. It is more likely than not that his resolution towards a world change is unaltered. His opportunism is not that of inconsequence. But the pendulum in Russia has swung from tho Left to the Centre and may be kept there by force of circumstances, just as it may also, if that force is relaxed, follow its original impulse to the Left again.The root cause of the change is the revolt of the peasantry and the fact that at the beginning of March villages which had experienced the confiscations, requisitions and mobilisations of the past four years were everywhere boiling with revolt. While the attention of Europe was fixed upon the rising in Kronstadt, rural Russia was in commotion. Some indication of this was given on pages 31-33 of our February report. Advices from well-authenticated sources, despite every device of suppression and denial on the part of the Soviet authorities, now prove that the movement was in truth more general than was immediately known even to those authorities themselves. It appears indubitable that mass risings which the Soviet Government was quite unable to control were taking place in the villages everywhere, and that early in March serious risings of &quot;unconscious&quot; peasants, so decentralised and un-organised that the Soviet Government was unable to suppress them, were springing up rankly all over Russia. The peasants&apos; gesture of despair had become an effective revolt against the party. &quot; Socialist traitors,&quot; to quote the recently published instructions from the Soviet Foreign Office to Fiirstenberg-Ganetsky in Riga, &quot; like Antonov, Voronkov, &quot; Zagorsky, Teplov, Nevcrov, Shubiu, Mastov, and others, were leading &quot; the unconscious masses against themselves.&quot; It was not in fact against themselves that they rose, it was against the hideous oppression of the Government Bureaucracy, of the Extraordinary Commission, of the System. The insurgents were, and are, being supplied with food by the peasants, who, as the same report concedes, &quot; are at heart all counter-revolutionaries.&quot;     ,Abnormal as the situation in Russia has been since the Soviet Government took the reins, the position at present is even more extra-ordinary. Russia is now a State endeavouring to maintain distinct within itself an individualist hemisphere and a Communist hemisphere. Trade on ordinary &quot; capitalist &quot; lines is permitted to the peasantry and the land in the rural districts has been restored to private hands. Meanwhile, the urban labourers have to live under the Communist System, under which the producer has no right of property in what he produces. The town population of Russia will not be allowed to make accumulations of capital while the rural population will be given freedom
to do so. There will not only he one law for the workman and another for the peasant or small farmer; there will he a separate system for each. The Communism and the Capitalism which have nowhere been able to come to terms in international relations now stand face to face within Russia itself.Under these circumstances can the Communist system be maintained ? Its stability within its own hemisphere is at stake. The question hinges very much on the relation between workman and peasant. Can the workmen of the towns be insulated from the peasantry which surround them ? All information tends to show that they cannot. The problem is, after all, not a new one. During the past year and more the workmen, overdriven and underfed in the factories, have been deserting to the villages. As will be seen in our article in this issue on the Russian transport debacle, men from the engineering works desert at every opportunity to the villages, where they take up the occupations (on a &quot;capitalist&quot; basis) of locksmiths, blacksmiths, &amp;c. Even within the works they fritter away their time and the Governments material in making articles to exchange with the peasantry. Now that the latter have established their right to freedom it would appear impossible even for the tyranny of the Soviet Government to maintain its hold upon the urban workers. That wretched bourgeois instinct to be free is making sad work of Lenin&apos;s passion to set the world to rights. It is even possible that in the course of time Russia, no longer the stronghold of Communism, may reconstitute herself from within into the peasant continent which she really is. Ungoverncd because no government can fling its arms wide enough to hold it, shaking off&apos; the preposterous bigotry which has tried to control it, perhaps allowing some emotionally liberal form of government to sit loosely upon it, it may send back the makers of the dismal Communist experiment to their conferences at Zinimerwald or Kienthal, while the Opportunists among them fill tho niches in the capitalist scheme of things which they have been assiduously preparing.2. THE RUSSIAN TRANSPORT DEBACLE AND ITS CAUSES : RAILWAYS, REPAIR PLANTS, AND WATER TRANSPORT IN 1920-21.This article is a precis of a confidential report by an ex chief officer of Inland Water Transport under the Soviet Government who escaped from Russia in January 1921.Administration.Till May 1920, Russian transport by railway and Russian transport by water were managed by separate Commissions elected from and by the Communists.In May 1920 the Third All-Russian Conference of Professional Unions (in connection with the general reorganisation of the Soviet Governmental Administration) adopted a new form of management of the Transport Department. Authority was placed in the hands of a single person appointed for the purpose. The election method was abolished. Lenin, at this Conference, declared that most of the Com-munists elected as Commission members though excellent men were incapable of administration. Specialists must take their places. This proposal, received at first with great indignation, was finally agreed to. New slogans were adopted to the effect that &quot; Workmen must&quot; return to their benches &quot; ; &quot; He who does not recognise the worth of a specialist is not a Communist.&quot;
The principle of centralised Government having thus been recognised on TrotzkTs initiative, the Institute of Commissars was created. These Commissars were expected to keep a close watch ou the work of the &quot; Specialists,&quot; each of whom was under tho surveillance of a Special Commissar or &quot; Political Nurse.&quot; Later the Institute of Commissars went the way of the Commission and its control functions were trans-ferred to the Professional Unions.In October 1920, Trotzki&apos;s proposal to unite the administration of rail and water transport was adopted. It resulted in the creation of one huge, cumbersome, absurd apparatus as unfit for practical work as the general chaos and incredible administrative delays that preceded it. Until quite recently the post of Peopled Commissar for Ways and Communications has been held by Trotzki, it is now occupied by a telegrapher, Trotzki having transferred his activities in this line to the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.Plants.The principal metallurgic and mechanical plants in Russia are united under the so-called &quot;Gomza&quot; (Joint State Machinery Construction Administration) of which there are at present three ; for tho Moscow, Petrograd, and Southern districts respectively.The Moscow Gomza contains the Briansk, Votka, Vyksunski-Gorny, Kolomna, Kulebakski, My tishtcby, Radetski, Rybinski, Sormowo, Tashin-ski, Twer, Charcow, Lugansk, Semenow, and Russian-American Co-operative Works. The Petrograd Gomza includes the Putilow and other northern works. Tho Juzowka works, and factories in the Dnieper and Ukraine districts are under the southern Gomza.Individual factories are under the exclusive management of the Gomza, which in turn receive all instructions and all necessary supplies for their production quota from the Supreme Economic Council at Moscow. Tho system completely subordinates managers of factories. Their initiative is destroyed. They must obey the regulations issued by the Gomza to the letter, and have to apply to it for instructions. Factories far away from Moscow, with poor postal and telegraph com-munication, cannot therefore function at all efficiently. The 1920 combined production programme of all the works in the three Gomza covered only 10 per cent of their normal capacity, and only 24 per cent, of that 1920 programme was carried out.By a disastrous decree of Trotzki&apos;s (No. 1042) the attention of the works was concentrated on medium and light repairs of locomotives, with less attention to the quality of the repairs carried out than to the quantity of repaired locomotives. At present no spare parts can be produced. Repairs are slovenly, and three to five locomotives are taken apart to repair one. There is no provision for inspection of repaired locomotives and materials. A well-known Communist, Gamzej (President of the Peasants&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Inspection Board), in a report at a Moscow Conference in December 1920, proved from statistics that Trotzki&apos;s decree had only aggravated the condition of the railroads ; that notwithstanding enormous expenses the number of idle locomotives was daily increasing as a result of tho careless work of the repair shops, lack of good engine-drivers and firemen, lack of fuel, and the excessive work required of the locomotives ; and that the engines were soon ruined beyond possibility of repair because of lack of materials and skilled workmen. For this Gamzej was sont to travel in Turkestan, but his report opened many eyes, and had its part in Trotzki&apos;s retirement from the post of People&apos;s Commissar for Ways and Communications.
The conditions obtaining in 1920 at the Votka State Locomotive and Machine Building Works are typical of conditions in all the rest of the Gouiza factories. The Votka Works arc situated near the river Kama in an area where provisioning facilities are on the whole good. The works use timber fuel, and possess immense forests. They are in fact better off than most. But the system levels down all advantages. The Votka works were intended to reach in 1920 about 12 per cent, of their pre-Kevolution capacity ; in practice they carried out only about 26 per cent, of this reduced programme. In 1920 tho works employed nearly the same number of workers as in 1914, hut in 1920 nearly half tho labour was supplied by women and children. Its paucity is the result of lack of supplies, lack of necessary materials, lac&apos;k of specialists, lack of individual initiative, and the demoralization of the labour masses.Labour.Under the pretext of lighting demoralization and enforcing labour discipline the workmen are exploited in a way no capitalist outside ancient Egypt has dared to conceive possible. Workmen are attached to the plants where they are employed, and are transferred by the orders of the Supreme Economic Council in Moscoav. They are scantily supplied with food. In some localities all that the workman gets is 24 lbs. of bread per month. The labourers are terrorised by the Communists ; carelessness and abandoning by a labourer of his factory are considered &quot; desertion from the labour front,&quot; and are punished by conlinement in concentration camps and even by death. There is a Communist &quot;Alveol&quot; or germ-cell of live or six Communists in every shop. It controls and terrorises the rest of the workmen. Only members of these &quot;germ-cells &quot; are eligible to attend the various conferences. The result is that most of the conferences are composed of Communists declaring themselves to be representatives of the interests of all Avorkmen, who support the Central Executive Committee in the promulgation and application of measures obviously contradictory to the aims of the majority of the Avorkmeu.The Central Distribution Bureau, regulating the Avork of all shops, issues cards Avhich are distributed among the Avorkmen, showing the Avork each man is expected to complete in a definite period. If the workman fails to do Avork mapped out for him one-third of his pay is detained. If his shortcoming becomes systematic he is confined in a concentration camp with compulsory labour for three months.But even measures so drastic cannot keep the starving, bare-footed, disillusioned Avorkmen to their factories, which they take every chance of leaving to earn their bread as farm hands or small craftsmen in the villages. At first the peasants treated workmen coining to the country with open suspicion and hostility. But in misfortune noAV they have found common ground. The fact is that both peasants and workmen are against Communism, a bond daily strengthening, as men able to serve as blacksmiths or locksmiths aro welcomed in the villages, where they work for the peasants in exchange for food.MeatiAvhile even workmen remaining at the plants live on bread obtained by exchanging with the peasants small household articles which they produce for themselves. The production of those articles robs the factory of much time and material. The measures taken by the Soviet control are ineffectual to force the hungry Avorkmen to Avork conscieu-tiously (according to Soviet standards) during the labour day. The position of specialists &quot; appointed by the Soviets at the head of Avork-shops is very difficult. They are responsible with their lives for the condition and output of the Avorks they manage.
In view of the hopeless condition of most of the factories the Soviets . have, in fact, decided to reduce the number of active works in order to be able to improve the output of the rest. A so-called &quot; Shock Group&quot; of factories, consisting of 22 engineering works, was organised in May 1920. In January 1921 only 12 works in this group remained. All the others had come to a standstill. If the situation does not improve the 12 will also be forced to suspend work.With the failure of the &quot;Shock Group&quot; the Soviet Government adopted the proposal of three members of tho Spartacist Party at the Third Conference of the Professional Unions at Moscow, and invited to Russia 200,000 unemployed German metal workers. Finally, however, it was impossible to satisfy the most elementary requests for food, lodgings, &amp;C, for these workers, and on their urgent demand they had to be sent back to Germany. Now, in January 1921, the Soviet authorities are trying to close a contract with 150 German engineers; the terms pro-posed are excellent, but it is very doubtful if, under existing conditions, they will be able to show any positive results.Railways.No railway traffic satisfactory to European standards exists in Soviet Russia. There is no freight traffic, for in the economic disorganisation there is nothing to transport. Besides the military traffic there is a make-shift passenger traffic between Moscow and Kieft&apos;, Moscow and Petrograd, Moscow and Charkow and Kostow, and Moscow and Ufa through Nijui Novgorod. One train composed of 10 to 15 ears runs once in two days between these towns. Only persons travelling on duty can use the trains. In the winter lack of fuel timber reduced the traffic. Until recently there were sufficient freight cars, but as the cars are worn and never repaired and no new ones were built, a shortage even of freight ears is beginning to bo felt.Water Transport.Water transport, though not in a good way, is in better shape than rail, because the main waterways, the Volga and the canal system which unites the Volga with the Neva, have suffered less from the civil war. In the Volga basin and canal system, and on the Dnieper and its tribu-taries, the numbor of steamboats in 1914 and 1920 was respectively 2,010 and 1,406, the number of wooden barges numbering in 1914,10,750, and in 1920, 1,000. In both cases the Soviet programme for rebuilding is miserably in arrears. On the Volga contractors in 1920 only succeeded in building 80 barges, against 96 which had become unserviceable. On the Dnieper the programme for 1920-21 included the raising and repairing of 50 per cent, of the Dnieper steamboats and the building of 1,000 barges. Up to January 1921 only 10 of the 1,000 had been built. These barges are of a sort used for one season only, at the end of which they are broken up for fuel timber.On the Volga no ballast dredges are working. The river is covered with sandbanks, and its level is very low. The Dnieper, for the same reason, has become so shallow that it is believed that navigation will bo impossible in 1921.Conclusion,In short, transport in Soviet Russia is daily deteriorating. Its advertised restoration is a &quot; fake &quot; intended to cover the disgrace of the Soviet regime. A special paper named &quot;Gudok&quot; (&quot;The Siren&quot;) in fact accomplished much in this respect by publishing false communiques
on the progress of the restoration programme, Railways are using their la?t rolling stock. The Soviet power is being forced to acknowledge its incapacity, and by its concessions to the peasantry to abnegate the doctrines to which it has been sedulously endeavouring to convert mankind in general. The general reason for the present decay aud ruin in Russia lies in the sterility of the Communist doctrine. To this lack of material, the insufficiency of skilled labour, and the spirit of destruction incidental to all revolutions have been secondary.3. BRITISH EYE-WITNESSES IN RUSSIA ON THE POLICY AND PREDICAMENT OF THE SOVIET REGIME.The following extracts are from intercepted letters sent, between March 13th and 24th, 1921, to comrades in Englaud by representatives of British communism now in Russia. .Tho writers can be taken to be as near the heart of the counsels of the Executive Committee of the Third International as is possible for any foreigner : 1. Letter dated Moscow, March 14th.&quot; There is a very difficult situation to be faced here. Tho food shortage is very bad. Industry is in great need of everything. The people are terribly tired. The army wants to be demobilised, especially that section made up of peasants who want to get back to their farms. The peasantry are in a very difficult position too. They are badly in need of machinery aud all kinds of manufactures, but the towns have nothing to give. Hence, while the industrial workers are in need of food from the peasants they have nothing to exchange. This was difficult last year, but more easy because there was always the cry of the enemy at tho gate. Now they are expecting more out of a worse situation owing to the bad harvest and the delay in the snowfall this winter, which badly affected the fuel problem owing to the fact that a great deal of the fuel transportation is done by sledge. So with the combination of the elements and the continuation of the blockade of foreign trade a very difficult situation is to be faced. Those who expect simply a straight road march on to communism are in for big disappointments. That cannot be. Until the extension of the revolution in the west the Russian workers will have to retreat and tolerate the restoration of a degree of capitalism, That is the only way they can gather their strength out of the world situation. So long as the Communists maintain the hold of the helm of the state all is well. We can retreat or advance according as the situation will permit. We are therefore destined to see an intense struggle between communism and capitalism in Russia itself. Important measures are now being taken which will strengthen the position of the peasants and restore free trade between town and country. This will mean the restoration of the market-place and the re-introduction of money currency. So far as Communist experiments are concerned they will be to a large degree in the towns and in industry. Thus if trade does open up with other countries the effect will be two-fold. It will help to alleviate capitalism in the west and strengthen the pro-letariat in the industries in Russia. At the same time, the peasantry will recover through the recovery of industry here
and a struggle will be set up for the conquest of the state machine, flow long we shall have to wait for the extension of the revolution no one can tell. But we can see clearly that delay in this direction makes increasingly problematic the maintenance of the proletarian dictatorship in russia. It is upon this fact that the capital states are gambling. All that we can do is to push on with our work aud get the maximum out of every situation that arises.&quot;Letters dated Moscow, March 18th and 15th.&quot; The first Executive Committee meeting was held on February 28th, and the first item on the agenda practically occupied the whole of the meeting. They discussed at great length the relationship between the German Communist Party and tho Bureau of Labour Unions, and finally decided that the Bureau itself should control its affairs and direct its methods of working in the Trade Union Movement. The Communist Party were desirous of governing and directing the work of the Labour Union International. The next item was my report from the organisation which I represent, namely, the Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committee movement.&quot;&quot; We are optimistic regarding the future of the revolutionary work in all sections of British industry, and, at least, in Russia their attention is focussed upon the work of the Shop Stewards movement, in tho speedy revolutionising of the trade and industrial unions, which will enable them to overthrow the bureaucratic leadership of the present officials, with their yellow and compromising influence, and to destroy the anti-quated constitutions of the same, and to reconstruct these organisations along the Hues of the class struggle.&quot;&quot; I am pleased to receive reports from certain comrades that arrived here last week, that the work is extending itself throughout the country. Near at hand a great industrial cloud hangs with thundering blackness and is about to break over your heads. This is an opportune moment for the British, revolutionaries in the mining movement to assert themselves and to clearly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of existing trade unions as at present constituted to deal Avith the situation, fight like tigers in the Y.M.A. for to get it to immediately secede from the Amsterdam Yellow International aud to affiliate with the Red International of Labour Unions established as Moscow, By the way, I&quot; am anxious that the Doncaster and District Workers&apos; Committee should become not only a propaganda group, but an organised force to be recognised in the probable fight in April or May. I heard that the conference in Mexboro, was a fair good success I was pleased to hear, and that similar conferences are being held throughout the coalfields of Wales and Scotland. Conditions in England are becoming more favourable for the work of the Communists. The Labour fakirs and the Socialist Reformers are&apos; revealed in all their impotency and weakness, and this should demonstrate to the masses the folly of completely relying on the yellow craftsmen to emancipate them.&quot;&quot;Capitalism has erected its huge superstructures at the expense of the life-blood of millions of workers, whose blood besmears the Avails of mills and factories, engineering shops, and mines, and still maintains its hold upon society by the
imposition of sufferings too horrible to describe. Why hesitate ? Why falter ? Why should you refrain from using similar methods and shrink and shudder from cleansing the earth from its parasitical putridity ? Only by wresting the power from the hands of these murderers by meeting force with force, violence with violence, can we ever hope to establish Inter-national Communism.&apos;&apos;4. THE &quot;INDIAN PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT&quot; AND THE INDIAN COMMITTEE IN BERLIN.There have been interesting indications during the last three months of the impending unification under a single leadership of tho various sections of the Indian Revolutionary Party for tho purpose of realising the ambitions of Chattopadhaya, the moving spirit of the Indian Committee in Berlin for bringing about a revolution in India with tho help of the Soviet Government.The principal instruments of the Indian revolution abroad are, first, the &quot;Indian Provisional Government&quot; in Kabul, and, second, the Indian Committee in Berlin. Communications between these two bodies are carried on through the Soviet authorities in Moscow.The present constitution of the &quot; Indian Provisional Government&quot; in Kabul consists of seven active so-called &quot;Ministers&quot; Mahendra Pratap (President), Barkatullah (Prime Minister), Obaidullah, Hashmet Ali, and Ahmed or Mirza Salim. Of tho other two &quot; Ministers &quot; the names are at present unknown. This committee (for despite its grandiose title it is no more) is carrying on active anti-British propaganda through Kashmir, and is believed to be in touch with India generally through the rcprosen-tative in that country of the Amir of Afghanistan.In Berlin the Indian Committee consists of Chattopadhaya, Pau-durang Khankhoji, Heramba Lai Gupta, and B. N. Datta, with Dr. Hafiz, Abdul Wahid, and B. N. Das Gupta as non-resident members. It seems probable that Miss Agnes Smedloy, the British sympathiser with Indian nationalism at present resident in Berlin, may be co-opted in the latter capacity.One of the late Talaat Pasha&apos;s earliest enterprises in Berlin was the foundation of an &quot;Oriental Club,&quot; formed ostensibly to bring together Orientals, really for Fan-Islamic and Oriental intrigue. Enver Pasha would seem to have given much attention to the club. Envoi declared that its basis was not creed but nationality ; its great aim was to afford Orientals in Berlin a common meeting place for co-operation in carrying on anti-British propaganda in the East. Enver foreshadowed the establishment through the club of political associations with common aims throughout Asia and Africa.Some months ago the Amir of Afghanistan is reported to have furnished the &quot; Indian Provisional Government &quot; with funds on condition that they would keep apart from the Russian Bolshevik representatives aud agents in Afghanistan. He had also come to an understanding with the Soviet Government that no propaganda work was to be conducted within Afghan borders. Russian pressure, however, has proved too com-pelling, and the Amir, in addition to concluding the recent treaty between Russia and Afghanistan, appears more recently to have sacrificed his first stipulation in a vain effort to protect his second, and has further agreed to allow the Russian Government to carry its propaganda into India through Afghanistan. Kabul has accordingly becomo the advanced centre for Russian propaganda in the Peninsula.
This news was immediately conveyed from the &quot; Indian Provisional j Government&quot; in Kabul to Chattopadhaya of the Indian Committee iu Berlin,   At the same time Mirza Saliin, one of the &quot; Ministers &quot; of the I M Indian Provisional Government&quot; was sent  to Moscow where  lie I arrived towards the end of November or early in December last with [ proposals and with instructions to secure further assistance for the i movement from the Soviet Government.   Simultaneously Chattopadhaya j left Berlin for Moscow and, along with Mirza Salim, had interviews with I Tchitcherin and other important officials,   The attitude of the Russians \ towards the two Committees of Indians is curiously illustrated by certain intercepted documents emanating from the Russian Commissariat for I Propaganda iu the East and passing between Bolshevik officials in&apos; Turkestan and Afghanistan.   In more than one of these inexistcnt Soviet military units and wireless stations are cited with the intent to bring home to the Indian Committees the power of tho Soviet arm.The overtures of Moscow to the Indian Provisional Government appear to have included requests for the supply of arms to the frontier tribes, as well as to India; arrangements were made for the transport of some 40 waggon loads of munitions belonging to tho Russian Government and stationed in the vicinity of Herat through Afghan territory to the Indian frontier, and for this transfer Salim was to arrange with the Afghan Government on his return to Kabul from Moscow.But Chattopadhaya was not minded that Mirza Salim alone should benefit from the journey to Moscow. Accordingly, behind the back of his &quot;Minister&quot; colleague he instigated the Soviet Government to insist, as a condition of its acceptance of the proposals put forward, upon the necessity for united action on the pait of the different Indian organi-sations throughout Europe, America, Afghanistan, &amp;c, and their centralisation tinder the leadership of one organised body.While, therefore, Mirza Salim took back to Kabul tho assent of the Soviet Government to the proposals of tho &quot; Indian Provisional Govern-nieiit,&quot; Chattopadhaya returned to Berlin to give effect to the schemes which he had initiated for amalgamating the various parties. About the third week in February a telegram was received by the Indian Committee in Berlin from Karakhan, Tchitoheriifs understudy in the Moscow Foreign Office, to the effect that Hashmet Ali, Mirza Salim&apos;s fellow &quot; Minister,&quot; had arrived from Kabul to make final arrangements on behalf of the &quot; Provisional Government.&quot; Karakhan asked Chatto-padhaya to assemble representatives of all organised Indian bodies in Moscow in order to meet the Afghan and Russian representatives there. Chattopadhaya, in reply, asked for the postponement of the meeting till April to givii him time to collect tho leaders he required from Europe and America. He has now informed revolutionary Indians in London that they must be in readiness to leave England at short notice for Moscow, to which, it is understood, these men will be smuggled with the aid of one of the Irish representatives in Berlin (whether Chattertou Hill, Gifford Emerson, or Pillai, is uncertain), and by a German named Ingmann, also in Berlin.B. N. Das Gupta is reported to have arranged with the German Foreign Office, during his last visit to Berlin, that temporary passports should be issued to his brother S. N. Das Gupta and to S. K. Roy, so that no entry of this visit should appear on their British passports. This appears to have been done through the German Consul-General at Zurich. The three will go from Leipzig to Berlin, where the Indian Nationalist leaders wish to introduce S. N. Das Gupta and Roy to the Communist leaders who will give them lessons in Communism.   The
leaders avill he told that S. N. Das Gupta and Roy are the men ready to carry news to India and to choose men there to come to Europe for work in Russia. Some of these will stay in Russia ; others will return to India as Communist missionaries.Chattopadhaya left Berlin for Stockholm on March 1st, aud news may bo expected shortly of the successful conclusion or breakdown of the negotiations for funds to bring tho Indian delegates from abroad. Should the money be forthcoming, representatives of other Indian organisations will be brought to Berlin en route for Moscow.Meanwhile, the Soviet Government are reported to have been using Chattopadhaya as an intermediary for procuring poisoned gas bombs in Germany. According to the latest information on this subject he has been successful in getting bombs from the German Government and facilities for their transport from the different Socialist groups.Dr. Priiffer, said to bo the head of tho Oriental section of the Foreign Office, is reported to have told Chattopadhaya that he was prepared to give him all possible help except financial help, as the German Foreign Office was not in a position to make grants for such purposes at the present time.Printed by Eyre and Spottibwoode, Ltd., East Harding Street, E.O. i.
