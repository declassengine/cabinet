Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. /%SECRET.I circulate to my colleagues a Memorandum on the subject of the Imperial Wireless Scheme. I should be glad if it could be taken into eonsi deration.E. S. M.6th April 1021.MEMORANDUM.1. When at the meeting of the Cabinet held on 4th August 1920 it was decided to adopt the recommendations of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy (Norinaa) Committee, the Secretary of State for India was asked to ascertain whether the Government of India would co-operate in carrying out those recommendations so far as they affected India, viz., &quot; that communication with India and the Far Kast and Australia should be provided by the erection of valve stations in Kugland, near Cairo, at Poona (or other Indian station), at Singapore, at Hong Kong, and in Australia at Port Darwin or . The Oovernnient of India slated on 20th September 1020 that on general grounds they were strongly in favour, if possible, of direct wireless communication between India and the United Kingdom, and that they could not agree to the &quot; two step &quot; scheme proposed by the Committee unless it were clearly established to their own satisfaction that direct communication is quite impossible. They also doubted the advisability of carrying out the work by Government agency rather than by private enterprise. In view of opiuions expressed by the Government of India it was felt that they ought not to be urged to co-operate in carrying out the Norman Committee recommendations without further careful examination of the whole question.o. It was ascertained that the War office and Admiralty both desired that the Norman Committee recommendations should be reconsidered, and a letter was accordingly addressed to the Secretary of the Offices of the Cabinet on 5th November 1020&quot;^setting out the objections felt to these reconunenda-%f tions and urging that the question of direct communication between England and India should be further reviewed at once. Both Mr. Churchill and Mr. Long concurred in the terms of this letter, and subsequently the Air Council informed the India Offiee that they also had written to the Secretary concurring.4. The reasons why it is considered that the Norman Committee recommendations should again be reviewed are briefly as follows : (a) There are the gravest strategical objections to making wireless communication with India dependent on a station in Egypt;Vy 3710     100 4/21
(/)) There are also, apart from the strategical objections to a &quot; two step &quot; scheme, the following serious objections in present circumstances to Government undertaking the responsibility of erecting and working the installation required for an Imperial wireless scheme such as that recommended by the Committee: (;) difficulty in finding money ;(ii) difficulty in finding personnel with the requisite technical qualifications and experience ;(iii) the likelihood of delay arising from (i) and (ii). Delay is particularly harmful to Indian interests, as the French are pressing on with their Fondicherry scheme.5. The objects of this further review would accordingly be to (i) substitute for the &quot;two step&quot; scheme, a scheme providing for direct wireless communication between this country and India.(The War Ollice think that, it should be possible to overcome the technical difficulties involved in such direct communication and the Government of India and their technical advisers arc of the same opinion.)(ii) consider the feasibility of entrusting the scheme to private enter-prise in order to avoid delay, and to save Government money and personnel.
