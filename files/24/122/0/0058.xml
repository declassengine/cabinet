April 23rd, 1921.
National Insurance (Forces of the Crown) Bill,MEMORANDUM.Section 46 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, as modified by later Acts, makes special arrangements as to the Health Insurance contributions to he paid in respect of seamen, marines, soldiers and airmen. Section 41 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, provides also Tor a special arrangement with regard to unemployment insurance for these men. The arrangement is that on their discharge a sum of 11. per head is paid to the Unemployment Insurance Fund which is calculated to he sufficient to credit each man with 90 contributions, and so to make him eligible for 15 weeks&apos; benefit.When the Ileservists were called out and the Defence l^orce was formed, it was decided that it,was unnecessary to provide them with 15 Aveeks&apos; unemployment benefit, having regard to the short period for which they would serve. It was therefore arranged that they should he treated in the same way as Reservists and Territorials coming up for their year of training, that is to say, that the Department would pay both the employees and the employee&apos;s contribution for each week they served, as if they had remained civilians. It has now been discovered that this arrangement is illegal, since the Treasury are advised that both the Reservists and the Defence Force must he treated as serving soldiers, &amp;c.No practical difficulty arises with regard to health contributions, since the arrangement made is more favour-able to the man than would he the special arrangement applicable to him under the National Insurance Act, and it is also convenient to his approved society, since it prevents his transfer from one class to another for a short-period and his re-transfer at the end of it to his old class.But as regards unemployment insurance the Treasury are advised that each of the men concerned could claim on his discharge to be credited wdth the full 90 con-trihutions, although he may have already received 90 contributions on his discharge from the colours a few weeks or months before, or may have received out-of-work donation.99-1
The total number of Reservists and Defence force is 162,000 men.If, therefore, no further steps are taken, the Govern -ment would be liable &apos;to pay (at 11. per head) a total sum of 1,134,000/., less the small amount already paid.It is clear that such a result of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, was never contemplated, and that such an expenditure would be quite unjustifiable. It is considered by all the departments concerned, including&apos; the Ministry of Labour, that the arrangement actually made provides sufficiently for these cases. It is sub-mitted therefore that a short Bill should he introduced forthwith, legalising what has been done, that is to say, providing that the Reservists and the men of the Defence Force shall be treated on this and future similar occasions for the purposes of health and unemployment insurance as though they were lleservists or Territorials under training.It is necessary that immediate steps should be taken to relieve the Exchequer of the enormous liability which will accrue if no action is taken. As soon as discharges begin the men will have acquired an almost inalienable right to the 90 contributions, as it would be most difficult to alter their conditions of service after such service had terminated. The Bill should therefore be carried through all its stages at the earliest possible date.If, therefore, the Bill cannot be passed in the course of next week it will probably be necessary to fall back on the issue forthwith of a Treasury Order under section 41 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, reducing tire number of contributions to, say, 24.This, it is estimated, would cost 21. a head, or a total expenditure of 324,000/. (less the amounts paid under present arrangements which are quite small).
