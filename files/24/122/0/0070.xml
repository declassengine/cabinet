PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The most important event of the week was the decision on the 15th April of the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, together with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, to cancel their proposed strike in support of the miners. By the avoidance of a Triple Alliance strike the coal dispute has again taken the foremost place in the situation. The National Delegate Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation is to meet on the 22nd, and until that meeting no further developments of importance are anticipated.The extent to which the principles involved in the dispute have been discussed publicly in the columns of the press and elsewhere-by outside parties, in a neutral spirit, has been remarkable. On the other hand the passive attitude of the national Labour bodies, such as the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, is noticeable when contrasted with their activity during the past 18 months, and in view of the hopes expressed at the time of the railway strike of 1919 regarding the part they might play in similar future emergencies.From the point of view, therefore, of the reaction upon trade union organisation of the present movement towards lower wage rates, such an event as the conference between members of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and representa-tives connected with the woodworking trades, mentioned in this Report last week, is of more importance than any of the events in connection with the coal dispute. A similar development is the establishment of a joint committee to formulate a common policy for the employees of London wholesale and retail distributive firms in resisting threatened wages reductions.Important developments may be expected in the building trades in the course of the next few days. The National Federation of Building Trades Operatives have not revised their attitude of hostility towards the scheme for the augmentation of labour in the building trades by trained ex-Service men, but, after the meetings referred to below the position should be much clearer with regard to the proposed establishment of a National Wages and Conditions Council and the proposed national variation of wages by means of a cost-of-living sliding scale.The agreement between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades on the subject of reductions in wages, which is subject to confirmation by the trade unions concerned, is dealt with below.A conference of the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation opened at Geneva on the 18th April. The annual meeting of the Scottish Trades Union Congress will open at Aberdeen on the 20th. On the 27th and 28th a national conference of Labour women will be held in Manchester under the auspices of the National Labour Party.The Unemployment Position.Statistics-Onthe8th April,in the United Kingdom 1,506,953 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,069,658 were lodged by males and 437,295 by females. At the same date 934,171 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which 432,518 were lodged by males and 501,653 by females.These figures show an increase on the previous week of approximately 57,000 totally unemployed and 59,000 working short time.The estimated total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 15th April was 1,686,900. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 370.
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.General Topics.Sympathetic Action by Trade Unions in Support of the Miners.-The national stoppage of work in coal mines has provided, not only a test by which the value of such joint trade union organisations as the Triple Alliance may be judged, but also a series of facts illustrating the various courses of action which are open to the trade union and Labour movement to adopt in similar emergencies. The following paragraphs give details of the activities, not only of the bodies attached to the Triple Alliance, but also of the other national labour bodies, some of the greater trade unions and some co-operative societies.Immediately on the stoppage of work in the mines, preparations were begun by the National Union of Railwaymen and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, in accord-ance with the terms of the Triple Industrial Alliance, for possible sympathetic action. District committees of the Triple Alliance were set up in various parts of the country, the most highly organised being the &quot; South Wales and Monmouthshire Central Committee,&quot; which was formed on the 14th April. This committee at once issued a manifesto to &quot; all branches of the National Union of Railwaymen within the area, to branches of the transport workers and to the lodges of the miners,&quot; setting forth the general policy to be adopted in the event of a strike. On the 13th April, Mr. Robert Williams, secretary of the transport workers, issued on behalf of the executive council a circular to all members of the Federation urging the formation of strike committees, consisting of members of all three bodies in the Triple Alliance, the idea being to work upon a common plan and adopt, where required, a common programme. In this circular, the need for absolute solidarity on the part of the various sections of the Alliance was emphasised, and also the fact that all violence should be avoided and there should be no provocative action on the part of those on strike. It was also urged that meetings should be held wherever possible for purposes of information and propaganda.With regard to sympathetic action on the part of unions outside the Triple Alliance group, the executive council of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen notified the Triple Alliance on the 13th April that their members would cease work simul-taneously with the railwaymen and transport workers, and, thereafter, were in close con-sultation with the National Union of Railwaymen and the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The London District of the Electrical Trades Union notified their willingness to join in the striked The National Federation of General Workers held a delegate conference on the 14th April and decided to &quot; support the Triple Alliance in its effort to resist wholesale reductions in wages and maintain conditions of labour.&quot; It was specifically stated at this conference that &quot; this resolution does not mean a general strike, but it means that the Federation will support the Triple Alliance whenever and wherever it can.&quot;On the 14th April a conference of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the National Executive of the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party, was held in the House of Commons, which was attended by delegates from the Triple Alliance, who stated the case for a strike. At this conference a resolution was passed pledging support to the Triple Alliance, and appealing to all sections of the Labour move-ment to stand solidly against the attack on the workers&apos; position. A committee was appointed to watch events in consultation with the Triple Alliance, consisting of the follow-ing members: For the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress: Mr. E. L. Poulton, Mr. A. Pugh, and Miss Bondfield ; for the National Executive of the Labour Party : Mr. W. H. Hutchinson, Mr. C. Duncan, and Mr. J. ramsay Macdonald; for the Parliamentary Labour Party: Mr. J. R. Clynes, Mr. T. Shaw, and Mr. J. Hodge; together with three secretaries, Mr. 0. W. Bowerman, Mr. A. Henderson and Mr. H. S. Lindsey.When the Triple Alliance strike was cancelled at a late hour on the 15th April, this com-mittee again met, but decided that no action could be taken in the circumstances. A further meeting, however, will be held on the 22nd.Financial assistance for the miners has been undertaken by some co-operative societies in the mining districts. In the county of Northumberland, certain societies have decided that foodstuffs shall be sold at cost price, and that goods shall be supplied to members on a credit system based on the amount which members normally purchase.  The Doncaster* See also below, under Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association. -(B 17243T) 3 A 2
Features of the Week-continued.Co-operative Society have lent a sum of money to the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association to enable benefit to be paid to the men at the rate of  1 per week, the stipulation being that the money shall ba repaid with interest within eight weeks of the termination of the stoppage. The Ripley Industrial and Co-operative Society, Ltd., have decided &quot;to lend, if necessary, the sum of  10,000 to the Derbyshire Miners&apos; Association, and  3,000 to the Notts Miners&apos; Association.Trade Boards Acts. In October last year the Minister of Labour appointed a Depart-mental Committee &quot; to make recommendations with respect to the work of the Trade Boards and the administration of the Trade Boards Acts.&quot; The committee was composed of three officials of the Ministry of Labour, two representatives of the chairmen and appointed members of Trade Boards, and four representatives each of the employers&apos; and the workers&apos; sides of Trade Boards. The report of the committee, with a minority report, has now been issued. *This Departmental Committee was appointed as a result of a deputation from the Trade Boards of Great Britain to the Minister of Labour on the 20th October last year.The deputation discussed the relations between the Minister and the Trade Boards in the discharge of their respective functions under the Acts, and made two main suggestions. The first was that certain administrative re-arrangements which were made last year as a result of the increase in the number of Trade Boards and of the work connected with the administration of the Acts, had tended to deprive Trade Boards of their influence in determining questions of scope and the lines of enforcement. The change was taken to mean in certain quarters that the Minister wished to encroach upon the functions proper to the Trade Boards. The second suggestion was that the Minister had exercised, without reasonable cause, his statutory powers of postponing or referring back rates fixed by Trade Boards.The department produced evidence before the committee which disposed of these suggestions. Detailed recommendations are, however, made in both reports with a view to defining accurately for the future the powers of the Minister on the one hand and the Trade Boards on the other, and to securing a close co-operation with the Trade Boards in such matters as enforcement and the interpretation of scope.Both reports express an appreciation of the value of Trade Boards.Increase of Rent Restrictions Bill. On the 12th April Mr. Richardson, M.P., supported by 10 other members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, introduced into the House of Commons under the ten-minute rule this Bill to suspend for one year the increase of 10 per cent, on net rent which, under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, will become permissible after the 2nd July next. The Bill also proposes to continue the provisions of Section 13 of that Act, which relate to business premises, until the whole Act itself expires on the 24th June, 1923.fThe Labour Housing Association, at their annual meeting on the 30th April, will discuss, among other things, a resolution in favour of the unconditional withdrawal of the 10 per cent, increase on net rent, which the Labour Bill proposes to suspend for one year.Trade Union Topics.Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association. The policy of this association with regard to the present crisis was made clear by instructions issued to the members, after a con-ference with the London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union.The association did not propose to withdraw their members from work, but had decided :-(1) That members of the association employed on railway or tramway systems will carry out their normal duties only, and not do the work of any employee on strike, or supervise or instruct any volunteer labour that is introduced.(2) That, in respect of the electricity supply stations, the members of the association will maintain the supply, and use every endeavour to prevent this industry being involved in the present dispute. Before any action is taken which is likely to affect the electricity supply industry, a conference of the unions concerned is to be called.These instructions, when read with the similar instructions issued last September at the time of the threatened strike of members of the Electrical Trades Union employed in powrer stations, throw light on the relations which tend to exist between this association, predominantly middle-class in membership, and the ordinary trade unions with which it comes into contact.* Printed and published by H.M. Stationery Office, but not on sale to the public, f Under the Act the provisions of Section 13 expire as from the 24th June next.
Features of the Week-continued.Scottish Trades Union Congress. The twenty-fourth annual meeting of this Congress is to be held in Aberdeen on the 20th April. The Parliamentary Committee will put forward resolutions on the housing question, calling upon the Government, among other things, to encourage the formation and use of building guilds working in conjunction with local authorities who are unable to use direct labour. Another resolution calls for the repeal of the&apos; Emergency Powers Act, 1920, and. the agenda includes motions dealing with Scottish Home Rule, the nationalisation of mines and railways, the Irish question and unemployment.Control of Industry.Ministry of Transport (Transfer of Railways) Bill. This Bill* was introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. J. H. Thomas on the 22nd March, and is backed by 10 other members of the Parliamentary Labour Party. The Bill outlines the Parliamentary Labour Party&apos;s scheme for the future of British railways. In the first place it provides for the transfer of the ownership of the railway undertakings of Great Britain to the Minister of Transport, and, generally speaking, it proposes to put the Minister of Transport in the place now occupied by the various railway companies.With regard to the management, however, it is proposed that &quot; the general direction of the transferred undertakings, and any extension thereof for the time being vested in the Minister, shall be conducted, subject to the over-riding authority of the Minister, by seven railway commissioners.&quot; The chairman and two of these commissioners are to be appointed by the Minister of Transport, three by the Minister from persons nominated by the recognised railway trade unions, and one by the Treasury.With regard to the civic rights of the servants of the railway companies on their becoming the servants of the Crown under the Minister of Transport, it is provided that it shall be lawful for them to participate in any civil or political action just as if they were not employed by His Majesty ; and that any person employed under the Minister who is about to contest a Parliamentary election, or has been elected a member of the House of Commons, shall be granted leave of absence from duty during such contest and one month thereafter, and for so long as he continues to be a member of the House of Commons and three months thereafter.With regard to disputes between the Minister and his new employees, it is provided that the Minister should prepare a scheme for affording to the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association, adequate representation, on behalf of their members, on boards to be established for the purpose of advising the Minister on, and adjusting, disputes which may arise in connection with remuneration and conditions of service.Some 30 of the 50 pages of the Bill deal with superannuation funds.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National). The first session of the new Wages and Conditions Council for the building industry will be held on the 21st and 22nd April, but the result of the ballot of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives on the question whether their members shall accept the proposed cost-of-living sliding scale is not yet known. Until it is declared, it is understood that the trade union representatives will argue that the present-wages should continue.Shipbuilders (National). Following upon interviews between the Minister of Labour and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, respectively, negotiations were re-opened at Carlisle on the 19th April.f between these two bodies. The conference, which lasted all day, resulted in an agreement being reached on the following terms, which are to be recommended to the men for acceptance : &quot; That the 6s. per week to time-workers, and the 15 per cent, on piece-rates to piece-workers, be withdrawn in two equal instalments, the first in the week ending May 7th and the second in the week ending June 4th.&quot;* H.C. Bill, 53.f The previous conference took place at Carlisle on the 31st March. See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 15, 9th April, p. 331.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.Sawmillers (Scotland). The Scottish Timber Merchants and Sawmillers&apos; Association have intimated to the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists their intention of reducing wages by 4d. per hour as from the beginning of the first full pay in May. They thus appear to have decided not to await the result of the national negotiations respecting wages in the shipbuilding and engineering industries. A conference, Jiowever, was held in Glasgow on the 15th April, at which it was decided to postpone definite action, and negotia-tions are proceeding.Packing-Case Makers (Scotland). A further conference between the Scottish Employers&apos; National Federation of Packing-Case Makers and the Amalgamated Societv of Wood Cutting Machinists, respecting the proposed reduction of wages and the introduction of a sliding scale based on the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number,* has resulted in the union&apos;s undertaking to refer the proposals to a ballot vote of their, members.The result will be declared this week, and provisional arrangements have been made for a further conference towards the end of the month. It is understood that the employers&apos; federation will take no precipitate action in the matter.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). The national stoppage in the coal mining industry con-tinues.   The following is a brief outline of the main developments during the week.On the 13th April the Triple Alliance held a conference at which it was announced that the transport workers and railwaymen had finally decided to strike at 10 p.m. on the 15th. This decision was conveyed by letter to the Prime Minister, and was followed next day by a visit from the men&apos;s leaders to explain their decision to him.In the evening of the 14th some 200 members of the House of Commons met informally the leading coalowners, who stated their case. Later, Mr. Frank Hodges put the case for  the miners, -and intimated that the miners were prepared to discuss a temporary wages settlement, provided that a period of time were fixed for the negotiation of a permanent settlement, to contain the principles of a national pool and a national wages board.The owners at this time also sent an invitation to the Miners&apos; Federation to discuss nationally and locally those cases in which wages reductions would be most severe.On the morning of the 15th April the Prime Minister communicated with the Miners&apos; Federation, inviting them to a further conference with the owners, but, contrary to expectation, the miners declined the invitation. Their view was that &quot; the only condition upon which a temporary settlement can be arrived at is one that must follow the concession of the two principles &quot; of a national wages board and a national pool. In the afternoon Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., announced that the strike of railwaymen and transport workers, fixed for 10 p.m. that day, was cancelled owing to the fact that, in view of the miners&apos; refusal to resume negotiations on the basis of Mr. Hodges&apos; suggestion, a strike in their support would be incomplete and foredoomed to failure.The members of the miners&apos; executive are at present in their respective districts, discussing the situation with their constituents and will return to London on the 21st April, when an executive meeting will be held. A full Delegate Conference of the Federa-tion has been called for the 22nd when future action will be discussed.Shipyard Joiners (National). There have been no developments of importance with regard to the strike of shipyard joiners. Neither side appear to have any intention of giving way. The executive of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, now incorporated with the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, have made a statement to the effect that 70 per cent, of those who came out on strike throughout the country have been absorbed in the building trades.Settlements and Agreements.Waterproof Garment Workers (Manchester).-The Indiarubber Manufacturers&apos; Associa-tion state that the employees of Messrs. Frankenberg, Salford, have accepted the 17  per cent, reduction.f[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments section of the Report, pages 365 to 368.]
PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.engineering, shipbuilding and allied trades.Wire Workers (Scotland).-l\\ March the Scottish Wire Work Manufacturers&apos; Associa-tion intimated to the Scottish Friendly Society of Wire Workers that a reduction of \\d. per hour on time-rates and 15 per cent, on piece-rates would take place in the week ending the 8th April. A postponement of the change till the week beginning the 29th April was agreed upon. The society requested a representative of the department to attend a conference of the parties on the 12th April.Discussion centred round the society&apos;s contention that only general fluctuations in the engineering industry would determine any alteration in the wages of their members. The association^ interpretation of the agreement reached in May, 1920, was that any fluctuation in the wages of engineers in the shipbuilding industry should govern the alterations in the Scottish wire work industry. They admitted, however, that there had been a misapprehension. The question of the proposed reductions was then discussed. Both parties evidently desired to be independent of other industries in regard to wages, and arrangements have been made whereby members of the society will consider the utility of framing a sliding scale based either on the cost-of-living index number, or on the prices obtaining in the industry in Scotland.Surgical Instruments. The Industrial Council, on the 14th April, confirmed their previous decision not to associate with the Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees.Shi])builders (National). At the meetings which were arranged for the 13th April, the Minister discussed the position separately with the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation, and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. On his suggestion, the parties agreed to a further meeting.*Barge Builders (Thames). In June, 1920, the Chief Conciliation Officer, London, made inquiries into the refusal of the River Thames Barge Builders&apos; Trade Union to allow members of the shipwrights&apos; society to work for Messrs. Griffin &amp; Co., on barge repairing at Greenwich. The union is exclusively a Thames organisation, and elsewhere barges are built and repaired by members of the shipwrights&apos; union. A year or two ago the shipwrights refused to amalgamate with the union, and in consequence the union now strictly adhere to their rule that shipwrights should not be allowed to do their work on the Thames. The Chief Conciliation Officer approached the secretary of the Joint Standing Committee of Shipbuilding Trades, on which both unions are represented, but was told that the committee could not intervene except at the request of both unions.Recently the Association of Master Lightermen and Barge Owners drew the attention of the department to the matter, the union having refused to allow shipwrights to work on barges at the yard of Messrs. H. Covington &amp; Sons, Tilbury. In an interview with the Chief Conciliation Officer, the secretary of the union suggested that the shipwrights might be employed on barge work on the Thames during busy periods, and discharged when work became slack, but he did not think it likely that his union would support the suggestion. Representatives of the Association of Master Lightermen and Barge Owners also thought that there would be difficulties, but promised to bring the matter before their members.building and works of construction.Building. The Management and Costs Committee of the Industrial Council on the 7th and 8th April considered a draft report on a supplementary scheme for unemployment insurance. It was agreed to recommend that a total benefit of 36s. per week, inclusive of the State benefit, should be provided by means of contributions from employers and operatives, which are expected to amount to Is. 2d. and Is. respectively, inclusive of the* See also p. 363 above.
Industrial Relations Department-continued.contributions payable under the general scheme. A slight additional payment may be found necessary to cover additional administrative expenses.At a meeting of the Administrative Committee on the 6th April the position of the Scottish Employers&apos; Federation in relation to the Council was discussed. At the last meeting of the Council these employers tendered their resignation, making a strong point that, apart from the question of expense, the special claims of Scotland were not adequately considered. The committee decided that the officers of the Council should be authorised to put forward to the Scottish Federation a suggestion that the Council will be prepared to recognise a Regional Council for Scotland, if no other means of retaining their connection with the Council is possible.Painters (Wisbech). The building trades operatives have not come out in support of the painters, who were on strike as a protest against the proposed reduction of their rates of wages from Is. lid. to Is. 4d, per hour.* It is reported that eleven of the strikers returned to work, on the 6th April, at the reduced rate of Is. id. per hour. In the opinion of the local employers the strike is collapsing, but it is stated that an official of the painters&apos; union is going to the district to see what arrangements can be made.Plumbers (Aberdeen). It is reported that the dispute between the Aberdeen Cor-poration and the plumbers and domestic engineers engaged on the Torry housing schemef is ended, and work was resumed on the 1st April. The man in dispute has rejoined the union by paying all contributions due, and the union agreed to the suggestion of the Corporation that no fine should be imposed for working during the dispute.quarrying.Quarrying. The first meeting of the Chalk Sectional Council of the Quarrying Joint Industrial Council was held at Montagu House on the 14th April. The constitution was adopted. Mr. Alfred Brooks, of the Chalk Quarry Owners&apos; Association, was appointed chairman ; Mr. T. E. Smith, J.P., of the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, vice-chairman ; - and Mr. R. Harting, secretary.On account of the national emergency it was decided to prolong the wages agreement, which expires on the 20th April, for 14 days, and that the Council should meet on the 26th April to consider the wages question. An emergency committee was appointed, with powers to act should the national position not be favourable to a meeting of the whole Council.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Baking. The meeting of the employers&apos; side of the Industrial Council unanimously decided to convene a meeting of the Council for the 14th April. At this meeting the operatives agreed, on certain conditions, to suspend strike notices until a new national agreement is evolved.   A further meeting was arranged for the 19th April.Members of the Glasgow Master Bakers&apos; and Confectioners&apos; Association met on the 13th April, and reaffirmed their former decision to secede from the Council.Bakers (Hull). With two exceptions the union men have now found employment elsewhere, and the matter may be considered as at an end.Flour Milling.-T)ie Executive Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 7th April to consider proposals, put forward by the employers, for an immediate reduction in wages of 10s. per week, and for a revision of the classification. After discussion, the employers modified their demand to one of a 5s. reduction, to take effect on the first pay-day in May, and to remain in force until the end of June, when the position should be reviewed. The workers decided to take a ballot of their members on this proposal. On the 15th April the committee met to hear the workers&apos;&apos; reply. It was unanimously agreed, in view of the national crisis, that the claim for a reduction of wages should be adjourned without prejudice for about a month, and that in the interval the wages agree-ment of July, 1920, should hold good. In return, the workers&apos; side undertook to do all that was possible to keep the mills running, and to arrange road transport to and from the mills.
Industrial Relations Department-continued.transport.Carters (Loiulon). Representatives of the employers&apos; side of the Industrial Council attended at Montagu House on the 14th April, together with representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation^ Sir David Shackleton saw both sides separately, and afterwards the two parties met, without officers of the department being present, the employers having expressed their willingness to hear what the workers had to say. The employers&apos; chairman reported to Sir David Shackleton that they felt that, in view of the threatened stoppage in connection with the coal dispute, and of the fact that they had no mandate from their respective districts, it was not possible to enter into negotiations for the present. They would not, however, reply to the workers in the negative, but would keep the question open for the time being, and would report to their districts Sir David Shackleton&apos;s remarks and the statement put forward on behalf of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation. He then met the representatives of the workers again, and reported to them accordingly.chemicals and explosives.Soap and Candles. Following on the meeting of the Industrial Council on the 23rd March, when the employers agreed to hold over, for a time, their notice of reductions in wages, they put forward a proposal for consideration by the workers, who asked for a meeting of the Council. This was held in Liverpool on the 11th April, and an arrangement was eventually made that, as from the third pay-day in April, rates should be reduced by 6s. for men, 2s. for youths of 16 to 18, and Is. for boys under 16, 4s. for women over 18, and Is. for women under 18. The employers&apos; proposal that a further reduction of 2s. for men, and Is. for women, should be made on the first pay-day in June was waived, but on the understanding that it could be brought forward again at any time.textiles.Dyers ami Bleachers (Scotland).-The arbitrator appointed in respect of the difference between the Amalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers and Kindred Trades, and the Scottish Federation of Dyers and Bleachers, decided that the scale of war wages proposed by the employers was justified, and should be effective as from the first full pay-day in the week following the receipt of the Award.printing and paper.Tinplate Decorating (Neath).-Reference of the dispute at the works of the Tinplate Decorating Co., Neath,f to the Conciliating Committee of the Joint Industrial Council, was approved by the Tin Box Manufacturers&apos; Federation, although the firm, who are affiliated to the federation, do not come within the Councils jurisdiction. The secretary of the f edera-tion represented the firm at the hearing on the 7th April. The committee awarded an increase of 5s. a week to the man concerned.miscellaneous trades.Tailors and Tailoresses (London).-k strike of more than 1,000 tailors and tailoresses is in progress in the West End, resulting from the employers&apos; association giving notice of a reduction of 2d. per log hour as from the 11th April. Negotiations at the Conciliation Board meetings on the question of arbitration broke down. The unions concerned, the Amalga-mated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses, and the United Garment Workers&apos; Trade Union, reported the matter to the department. They contend that the reduction is unjustifiable, the existing rates being not more than 100 per cent, higher than those of 1914. They state that they represent a class of workers who received no advance for a very considerable number of years before the war, in spite of their highly skilled work. Both unions agreed to the suggestion of arbitration. The employers, however, contend that the reduction is absolutely necessary, and maintain that the workers could earn more on the lower rates, as there would be more work available. They are unwilling at this stage to commit them-selves to arbitration. It has been agreed, however, that a further meeting of the Conciliation Board shall be held, and they may accept arbitration if no settlement is reached.A considerable number of important firms have agreed in writing with the union to continue the present rates until a settlement is reached.Co-operative Employees (Aberdeen).

A letter has since been received from the society to the effect that in view of the reduction in the cost of living, the downward trend of wages and the amount of unemployment, they must abide by their decision.Co-operative Employees (North-East Coast). With reference to the threatened strike of the employees of St. Anthony&apos;s Co-operative Society,* a conference was arranged between the parties for the 11th April, at which progress was made. The society agreed to the prin-ciple of paying the district&quot; rate, following the agreement reached for the Northern co-operative societies last November. The question of retrospective payment, however, is undecided, but it was agreed that another conference should take place.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 12th April. Mr. Gerald Bartlett, chairman of the Washford Mills Works Committee, was present by invitation to discuss the question of adopting an apprenticeship scheme in the industry. It was resolved to recommend to the full Council that a sub-committee be appointed to report upon the desirability of any apprenticeship scheme and, if favourable, to draft a scheme.Match Manufacturing. A meeting of the Joint Industrial Council was held on the 11th April when the position with regard to youths&apos; wages again came under consideration. Nine out of 17 District Councils who expressed an opinion approved of the resolution passed by the London District Council on the 3rd March, f A resolution was carried by eight votes to five that the Council take no action in the matter.The chairman made a special plea for consideration of the position of boys or lads who might be thrown out of work during a very difficult period. It was subsequently unani-mously agreed that the question of the wages of lads, 18 years of age, should be referred to the Wages Sub-Committee, and that the next meeting of the Council, on the 5th May, should constitute this committee.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-At the annual meeting of the Provincial Council for Northumberland and Durham, on the 9th April, it was stated that out of 83 local councils in the area 60 are now parties to the Council. The trade union side stated that they had agreed to accept the employers&apos; proposal of one penny per hour reduction, as from the 2nd May, on all classes of the graded rates, for those councils who had already adopted the grading scheme.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Committees. The National Joint Industrial Council for Insurance Committees&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services met on the 15th April. A scale of minimum salaries for clerks to committees was approved, and is to be submitted to the Ministry of Health. Other matters discussed were the question of finding employment for officers affected by the termination of sanatorium benefit, and also the establishment of district or local committees.Entertainments Industry. A meeting of the Executive Committee of the Entertain-ments National Industrial Council was held on the 12th April. Discussion took place as to the failure of the branches of the Cinematograph Exhibitors&apos; Association to adhere to the conciliation clauses in the constitution of the Council. It transpired that the association was a loose organisation with little control over its members, who invariably claimed the right of independent action when it suited their purposes. It was agreed that represen-tatives of both sides of the Council should approach the officials of the Association informally, with the suggestion that branches of the Association should be asked to endorse by resolution the constitution of the Council, and that, failing a satisfactory assurance on this proposal, a deputation from the Counci], should wait on the General Council of the association.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 360 to 364, 369 and 374.]
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a motion by the representatives of employers to reduce the minimum rates, and of workers to increase them, but after prolonged discussion, the matter was deferred.The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Ministry asking for the opinion of the Board with regard to the minimum rate applicable to a tailor who had coni-pleted 5 years&apos; apprenticeship and 2 years&apos; subsequent employment in the trade, in addition to 24 years&apos; service as a tailor in the Army, and agreed to recommend to the Board that the general minimum time-rate applicable should be Is.

Reports show an appreciable increase in unemployment, but the position on the whole cannot yet be regarded as so serious as was contemplated at the com-mencement of the coal stoppage. The number of firms who resumed work after the extended holiday period appears to be larger than was expected, although many will be affected by restrictions in fuel consumption. The general outlook is, however, sufficiently serious to cause grave apprehension as to the effect of a prolonged dispute. The main alterations in the position during the week are noted below.Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel.-li\ the Northern Division the unemployment figures show an increase of 29,000 men and 850 women, a very large proportion of whom are iron and steel workers. At Blaydon, an iron works, employing some 600 men, has closed down, and an engineering firm, employing 450 men, are also closing down. At Consett, only one blast-furnace is working, and at Middlesbrough 30,000 workpeople are already affected by the coal dispute. At South Bank, Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co., Ltd., have only two blast-furnaces going, and these are on slack blast. The flrm&apos;s Eston ironstone mines have also ceased work.At Elswick, Messrs. Sir W. G. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., Ltd., are still carrying on, but it is expected that 6,000 men will be put on short time immediately. An iron company at West Hartlepool, employing approximately 1,000 men, have closed down, and at Workington 2,000 men employed in the local steel works have been thrown out of employment. At Cleator Moor, all iron-ore mines are closed down and the ironworks have blown out their furnaces.At Sheffield, Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., and Messrs. had fields, Ltd., have put off about 2,500 men, and at Chesterfield 3,000 men are involved in the closing down of the furnaces, coke-ovens, and by-product plants of the Staveley Coal and Iron Co., Ltd. The Steel Nut and Joseph Hampton, Ltd., Wednesbury, employing 700 men, have closed down indefinitely.  All furnaces and ironstone mines in the Northampton district are idle.In South Wales, steel works are idle at Ebbw Vale and Dowlais. In Scotland all the blast-furnaces in the Coatbridge district, employing approximately 1,000 men, have blown out; and at Parkhead, Messrs. W. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd., who employ at least 3,000 men, contemplate closing down almost immediately.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde it is not anticipated that the stoppage will seriously affect the shipyards for three weeks or more. On the Tyne, Tees, and Wear, unemployment is increasing, but as yet there have been no abnormal discharges from the shipyards. At Southwick, shipbuilding firms are maintaining their establishment almost as steadily as before the Easter holidays.  The position in the ship-repairing yards at
Employment and Insurance Department-continued,South Wales ports is very unfavourable, and no improvement can be looked for pending a settlement of the coal dispute. At Goole, the Ouse Shipbuilding Co.. who have already discharged half their staff, are expected to close down within the next few days.Textile and Clothing. The improvement which appeared possible in the cotton trade cannot progress until the labour situation is brighter. Although most mills have sufficient coal for two or three weeks, uncertainty as to developments in the transport trades is causing employers to proceed with caution. Most wool textile firms have resumed work after the holidays, and are continuing to run on short time.Although better hopes are entertained of an improvement in the lace trade, a number of factories have already closed down owing to shortage of coal. It is hoped, however, by careful rationing, to keep a number of factories going. In the boot and shoe industry, the slight improvement which was beginning has been checked, and some manufacturers contemplate suspending operations pending a settlement of the dispute.Miscellaneous Trades. In the pottery trade a large number of manufacturers have closed down owing to short supplies of coal, and, where work is proceeding, operations are chiefly confined to decorating.In the Bristol district, locomotive engineering works have gone on short time, but motor engineering may be able to continue for about three weeks.In the Metropolitan area no abnormal discharges are reported from factory districts, but at Leyton an electric wire company, employing from 1,200 to 1,400 workpeople, have gone on short time.Transport. The timber trade at Hartlepool is very slack, and the prospects for the present season are regarded as the poorest in recent years. At South Shields about 500 trimmers, stevedores, and foyboatmen have been added to the registers during the week.On the Mersey the effect of the coal stoppage is indicated by the fact that about 20 vessels have been ordered to stop bunkering and are held up indefinitely.Women&apos;s Emjjloyment,Local Reports. In the North-Western Division, Ash ton and Blackburn report a slight improvement in the cotton industry, and during the week 1,497 applicants restarted work in the cotton trade in the latter area. Several cotton mills in the Darwen area began work again last week, but, owing to the coal strike, some, it is thought, will close down again.  At Farnworth several mills resumed work after an extended holiday.Shortage of coal is stated to be responsible for increased unemployment in the hatting industry at Denton. At Openshaw there is general depression in all industries; a firm of general manufacturers employing 1,000 workers have closed down indefinitely. The rubber and chemical trades are seriously depressed, and all classes of machinists are unemployed. In Liverpool every industry is practically at a standstill, and unemployment is increasing greatly. There are nearly 8,000 women on the live register m this town, and over 5,000 at Manchester.At Nottingham the lace making-up trade is practically dead. There are, however, slight improvements in the blouse-making trade and in fancy hosiery. In other lace centres there are slight improvements, but the effects of the coal strike are already being felt.  Some improvement is shown in the silk industry at Braintree.The coal strike has already made itself acutely felt in the West Midlands Division. In Birmingham alone, over 34,000 women are on the live registers, exclusive of short-time workers. Other towns in the division are also much affected. At Coventry unemployment is acute, and there are no signs of improvement. At Burslem the live register is five times as large as it was a week ago. Similar reports are received from Stoke-on-Trent, Longton and Newcastle-under-Lyme.Unemployment continues to be serious in the London area, and general depression in all industries is prevalent. In the South-Western Division the staple clothing industries remain depressed. In Wales unemployment is on the increase, and the tinplate trade continues to be slack. In the Northern Division workers are being suspended from brick-yards and the ropery factories.Unemployment is said to be increasing in Scotland, and depression continues apparent in the textile trades, in the hosiery, linen, flax, jute and carpet and thread factories.local employment committees. &apos;Employment. In areas where application has not already been made to the Unem-- ployment Grants Committee for financial assistance in respect of relief schemes, com-mittees continue to press the local authorities to make application forthwith.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.The Romsey (Southampton) Sub-Committee deplore the fact that large tracts of land have been allowed to get out of cultivation, and are of opinion that farmers and landowners should revive the arrangements for land cultivation which were enforced during the war. Grays suggest that the time is now opportune for the construction of a Thames Tunnel between Gravesend and Tilbury.Unemployment Insurance. Walham Green and Bromley point out that men dis-chargecl from the Army after the 31st July, 1920, and in some cases as late as November, 1920, had no chance of satisfying the conditions as to proved employment; they suggest that military service should be counted as employment for the purposes of the Act.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 11th April, 24,878 certificates have been issued to employers under the National Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 276,397 disabled ex-Service men. iThe trade depression continues adversely to affect the absorption of disabled men in industry, but the reports of Divisional Controllers indicate that the increase of unemploy-ment among disabled men is far less marked than that in unemployment generally. Evidence accumulates that the preference in operation with regard to Government contracts is a powerful factor in inducing firms to become signatories to the National Scheme.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department unit also be found on pages 360, 365, 368 and 374.]APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 8th April the department placed 380 candi-dates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 53,216. Of these, 7,043 have been placed through the agency of the depart-menfs Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 831 ex-Service men and 40 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 8th April was .10,990 ex-Service men and 1,234 civilians. At the same date 892 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 361 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 8th April the department received 58 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 3,104, of which 1,310 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 687 cases. At the same date 278 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 36 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,157 cases, in 498 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the - Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 314 cases, and abandoned training in 46; 115 are still in training, and 23 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 12th April 24,385 men were in training, as against 24,502 on the 5th April and 24,749 on the I5th March. During the week 372 men were placed in training. There were 16,867 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 5th April and the 15th March being 16,604 and 16,490. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 29,708, the totals for the 5th April and the 15th March being 29,219 and 28,071.
Appointments and Training-continued.In February the average number of weekly placings was 452, but this figure fell during March to 360. During March the total of men in training was reduced by 524, and the waiting list increased by 290 names. Nearly 3,000 new applications were received during the month, the highest figure so far recorded.The number of men taking institutional training outside the Government Instructional Factories continues to fall, and there has been a marked decrease in the number of men now in workshops, due largely to the inability of the majority of employers, at the present time of depression, to add ex-Service men to their staffs either as improvers or for whole-time training.Workshop Vacancies. Attention is still concentrated on the question of finding workshop vacancies. Several divisions, including the Northern, the South-Western and Scotland, have set up special departmental committees for canvassing employers and dealing generally with the problem, and in several instances the assistance of the local officers of the Apprenticeship Branch is stated to have been found very useful.Exhibitions. The department are utilising to its fullest extent the space allotted by the authorities of the Building Trades Exhibition, opened at Olympia on the 12th April. Working exhibits in carpentry and joinery, plumbing, bricklaying, plastering, painting and signwriting, masonry and builder&apos;s draughtsmanship, have been arranged. The exhibition will bring to the notice of the chief employers in the trade the wide range of work which is undertaken.The Guildford Government Factory were able to show working exhibits in plumbing, painting, signwriting, bricklaying, and carpentry and joinery at an exhibition recently organised by the Guildford Borough Council Housing Committee at the local Drill Hall. Men from this factory will be employed on the erection of two houses under the borough scheme.Sanction has been received for the expenditure of a limited sum upon an exhibit at the Printing Trades Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall, which will be open from the 30th April to the 14th May. &quot;Government Instructional Factories. Since the decision by headquarters that men in all Instructional Factories may purchase a suit of clothes from one of the tailoring centres, at the cost of the materials plus 25 per cent., orders on a considerable scale for suits and overcoats have been received by the London Factories at Lavender Hill and the Old Kent Road.The Birtley plastering class are now engaged on internal work in connection with the four houses on the Walker Building Estate. Up to the present it has not been possible to get the Local Technical Advisory Committee to sanction the building of further houses, but efforts continue to be made.National Trade Advisory Committees: Engineering and Electricity. At a meeting of this committee, on the 31st March, the following resolution was passed in regard to the action of the Electrical Trades Union executive in precluding the admission of further men for training  &quot; That, in view of the trade having absorbed more than the quota indicated under the five per cent, scheme on the King&apos;s National Roll, and the number now in training, together with the present position of the industry, the Training Department be informed that this committee cannot take any further action at present towards securing the admission of any further men for training under Scheme XX for power and light undertakings.&quot;Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 13th April agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,124 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,030 apprentices employed by 17,509 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agree-ment between the parties is now 22,726.Applications. All apprentices with unmated applications in the West Midlands area have either been found employers, or have been offered a three months&apos; course of institutional training.Progress. The Great Western Railway Co. have recognised the need for new apprenticeship conditions in their workshops at Swindon. It would appear that the gang system of piece-work has made it difficult for journeymen to spare the time for teaching the apprentices without upsetting the work of the gang as a whole. The difficulty has been most felt in the erecting shop, where the return of 600 ex-Service apprentices
Appointments and Training-continued.had resulted in gangs having three times the normal number of apprentices when the time came for them to pass through this stage of their training.Institutional Training. The three months&apos; course for apprentice plumbers at the Royal Technical College, Salford, is now completed, and an extension is being considered.All arrangements have now been made for a special class at the Suffolk Street Technical Schools, Birmingham, for apprentices on short time, of whom there are 16 ready to start, and for a plumbers&apos; class at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh.A conference has been arranged between local headquarters for the London and South-Eastern area and the London County education authority, with a view to providing special classes for such unmated apprentices, and apprentices already under the scheme, as have applied for institutional training. It is hoped to make arrangements for all the 83 apprentices involved.GENERAL TRAINING.Apprenticeship (Building). At a recent meeting of the Federation of Building Trades Operatives of South Wales and Monmouthshire, a resolution was passed urging the national executive to press for the national apprenticeship scheme to be brought into operation as early as possible. Interest has been aroused in Anglesey and North Wales. The secretaries of various organisations of employers and operatives have been interviewed, and all are agreed that the scheme would be of considerable value to the industry.The meeting of the employers at Darlington on the 22nd March proved successful, and it is hoped that at the next meeting of the association delegates will be appointed to serve on the Apprenticeship Committee. The employers of Hartlepool and West Hartlepool, while in favour of the scheme, object to association with either Stockton or Middlesbrough ; endeavours are therefore being made to arrange separate meetings for the various big centres.Several of&apos; the smaller federated firms at Gloucester have signified their willingness to attend a joint conference with operatives&apos; representatives, but the two principal firms are very reluctant to become a party to the establishment of an Apprenticeship Committee, which will include certain trade union representatives. They allege that instances have occurred recently, where the trade union have impeded the progress of boys showing exceptional ability.Technical Training: Ironfounding. The importance of technical training in the ironfounding industry, to counteract the &quot; rule of thumb &quot; methods still in operation at the present day, was referred to at the first annual dinner of the East Midlands Branch ot the Institution of British Foundrymen, and in this connection the work of the Lough-borough College was mentioned. It was regretted, the principal of the college stated, that the students they were receiving in the foundry department were much below standard, and therefore the need for training on scientific lines was all the more urgent.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments ivill also be found on pages 360 and 368.]
