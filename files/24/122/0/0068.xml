5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS 5RITAKIIIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV2P.Ni-iF.KT.L.0.4E5LIIIP AT THE COST OF THF. RATES III COLLIERY DISTRICTS. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.SECRETSince the Cabinet considered my previous memorandum (CP.2857) on this subject I have made further inquiries as to the scale of relief adopted by the Poor Law Authorities.There is no standard scale of poor relief and neither the Local Government Board nor the Ministry of Health have ever attempted to prescribe a uniform standard throughout the country.   The amount of relief given accordingly varies in different Unions.   The scale adopted is an income rather than, a relief scale, the practice of Guardians be ins to give such amount of relief as will bririA, the income of the household applying for relief up to a definite figure.The following are the &quot;income&quot; scales adopted in certain Unions which are particularly affected by the Coal Strike. f&amp;erthyr Tydf11 Union   ...   15/- per man.15/- per woman 10/- for each child. ..,   15/- for the man and wife5/- for each child. ...   10/- for each adult.7/6 for the first child. 6/- for each further child.PontypriddBedwelity.Hemsrvorth24/- for a married woman living with her husband,.5/- for each child.(The unusual scale adopted at Hemsworth Is no doubt an attempt to overcome the legal difficulties created by the decision in the Merthyr Tydf11 case). .In the event of an application being made by a Board of Guardians for my sanction to a temporary loan to enable them
to defray the abnormal expenditure caused by the strike, I am advised that it would be possible to attach conditions to the sanction.   Such conditions might take the form of prescribing a maximum scale which is not to be exceeded In the case of the wives and children of miners, or alternatively, and I think preferably, a maximum scale applicable to all cases to which the proceeds of the loan are to be devoted;   and this requirement might be coupled with the further condition that the proceeds of the loan should not in any case be used for the relief of able-bodied men for whom work is available,   I think that such conditions could be justified on the ground first, that to finance current expenditure out of a loan is an undesirable policy and if permitted at all ought to be restricted to the narrowest possible limits, and secondly, that it is Impossible for me to give my sanction to loans for defraying expenditure which, in view of the Merthyr Tydfil decision, would without such conditions be of doubtful legality.Assuming that the course above indicated Is adopted it remains to be considered what 3cale should he prescribed. It is clearly desirable that the scale determined uponshould be kept low, and I suggest that we might adopt the following, namely:-15/- for a woman (e,g, wife of a miner)20/- for man and wife (where both are entitled to relief under the conditions above prescribed).5/- for each child.This scale to be an &quot;Income&quot; scale, and the relief actually payable to be such amount as is required to bring the income up to the scale.USTflY OB1 HEALTH. * MJr&apos;L &apos;23.4,21.-
