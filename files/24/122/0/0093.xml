Ihe Italian Government have agreed to take proper steps for their disembarkation.A Greek destroyer recently stopped the Bulgarian S.S. *KyrilB in the Black Soa, took off&quot;157 Turkish refugees en route from Varna to Constantinople, made thorn prisoners of war, and took thorn through the Bosphorus to Ismid.   After doing so, the destroyer returned to Constantinople, thus clearly establishing that the city is being used as a Greek Naval base, which cannot be tolorated.   The captain of the destroyer told Admiral Tyrwhitt that ho proposed to deal with subsequent batches of refugess in the same way, and was informed that this could not be allowed.It may be assumed that those refugees are among tho se whose return ha s be en,sancti oned by th3 Armis tico Commission., whose decisions aro therefore being overridden by the Greek Govern lent.DANUBE.The present dredging operations at the entrance to the Danube show little possibility of obtaining a depth of more than 21 feet over the base, as compared with 24 feet before the war.&apos;The European Danube Commission have therefore obtained an International Commission of Experts to advise on the possibility of improving the entrance, by causing the flow of the river to scour a further depth by means of properly conducted piers built at Sulina.Sir maurice Fitzmaurice is representing British interests on this Com ission.
