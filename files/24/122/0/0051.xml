His &apos;..yJ2 britannic ;-,iajesty&apos;3 Gj,crro:u3fit.) Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.CP. 2851. The Coal Dispute.(Revise.) _-For some time it has been made increasingly clear that the Government were not concerned to defend the coal-owners&apos; proposals as to the wages which should obtaiu at the end of control. These were figures for discussion, they were not endorsed by the Government, Yesterday, I think for the first time, the Prime Minister agreed that some of the figures were indefensible and must obviously be amended, I do not think that any Member of the Government who has watched these extremely difficult negotiations will dissent from the view that the Prime Minister expressed. On the contrary, 1 am sure 1 am not alone in feeling satisfaction that it has been stated.But J want to go a step further. The coal-owners knew for months that on 31st March control would end, and it seems to me to follow that thev must have known that the wages suggested by them would produce trouble-trouble which not only would affect their pockets but which would be a national disaster. In these circumstances their only excuse for putting forward the figures would seem to me to be an implicit belied&apos; that they were justified by the circumstances, and, further, that, that belief was well founded.Not only does the Prime Minister express, I believe, the united voice of the Nation in saying that they are not justified and are indefensible, but the mine-owners, in their recent oiler after the struggle had become almost desperate, have acknowledged, the same.It seems to me intolerable that in an essential service like this, the Government should be charged with the task of extricating the Nation from the results of the folly of the coal-owners, that our whole industry should be dislocated, that the recovery of our export trade should be indefinitely post-poned, that attention to the affairs of State and the business of Parliament should be interrupted, that millions of money should be expended because indefensible offers were made by coal-owners to those wiio get the coal. I most sincerely hope that some steps can be taken to prevent a recurrence ol this intolerable situation, not only in the coal trade, but in other vital services. I make no suggestion as to how this is to be done. I do not know how far the difficulty would be overcome by carrying out now the proposal made by the Government two years ago. Hut 1 do think at least that at the appropriate time the Prime Minister should address to the coal-owners, as he alone can, a letter of warning and reproof. The papers and speeches and letters have rightly contained warnings and reproofs to the coal-miners ami their allies.K S. M.19th April 1921.2IS3804-3     100 4.21
