GENERAL STATE OF TJE OCTrHY/&apos; StatlstiOB^ of Outragea. ,The total number of. outrages reported during the week is very much lower than that-of the previous week, but the re-duction is almost entirely- due to the sudden cessation of raids upon the offices of Petty Sessions Clerks which appeared in the return attached to my last report as a new form of Sinn Fein laiTlGDsnesSp    Although&apos;no raids of this kind took plaoe during the week ended the 11th, instant, a number of further oases occurring in1 the- previous week, have been reported -&apos;: bringing the total for that week from 33 to 44.    The object, of these raids was the seizure: of dog license payments,. ; Sums of money amounting in all to  1,048.7.3 were taken by the;&apos; raiders and in addition  414.2,11 was stolen in a raid on the   . office of a rate-col lector. ;- With t.v -y elimination of this ltetri from the previous week&apos;s return the figures for the past: tv/o weeks are approximately the seme and disclose no change in the general situation.    The number of, police&apos; murders fell from 8 to 4 but military casualties increased from-.4 to. 6&quot;, and included 1 fatal casualty; The total casualties io the Crown.forces reached the samefigure (26) in each of - the two weeks, : &apos;&apos; * *   .&apos; -.&apos;, - &apos;.Attacks on the police - and military numbered 34.fcr.the.
1 *)Gweek.     Of this number 25 were ambushes, 6 attacks on police barracks and 3 assassinations^     The heaviest casualties suffer-ed by the Crown forces during the week were sustained in an ambush in Limerick City on the 8th instant,, a Head Constable being killed and two Sergeants and a Constable wounded.     One civilian was killed and threo wounded by rebel fire on the same occasion,A bomb outrage at Dromoro, Co. Tyrone, in which a Special Constable was wounded on the 6th instant was followed by the murders of three Sinn Poiners in that town on the same night. There appears to be no doubt that these murders wore committed as a reprisal for the wounding of the Special Constable, but from investigations which have been made there are grounds for thinking that they were committed by persons belonging to the civilian population of an adjoining locality which is strongly Unionist, and that no members of any branch of the Crown forces were engaged.Seven murders of civilians, attributable to Sinn Fein, were reported&apos;during the week, and seven attempted murders. Thirty-five raids on mails and four raids for arms were reported,Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 66 for the week.Trials of Civilians by Court Martial.thirty-four trials of civilians wore concluded during the week and resulted in 27 convictions and 7 acquittals.

-   133DEATH DF ARCHBISHOP rALSH.With the death of Dr. T/alsh, the Roman Catholic. Archbishop of Dublin, a very notable figure passes out of Irish life. Dr* 7&apos;alsh was at all times a man of strong political convio-tions and in recent years had transferred his support from the Parliamentary Nationalist Party to Sinn Fein, but he was known to be opposed to the physical force policy of the extremists, and his last Pastoral Letter contained an emphatic condemnation of secret societies as detrimental to public order.    As he had ceased to take an active part in public life the political consequences of his death will depend mainly upon the choice of the successor.(Intd)    H.G.Chief Secretary&apos;s Office,Dublin Castle.April 12th 1921,
