263(THIS DQOTOTT 13 THL.P2\QPrRTY 07&apos;HIS W^mZQ--KXfcSTP S r-OV ;^:,T) ,SECRET,CP. 2854.C A B I T B T. THE MliilftG DISPUTE. The suggested Pool. (Memorandum by Dr. Add!son.)I have read the official documents, the speeches in Parliament and other available statements an--, letters sealing with the question cf a pool, and it se..ms to me to &apos;oe vexy much open to doubt whether we, as a Government, r.re riot in excluding this question from impartial discussion air examine-tion in conference.   If it is a bad proposal, such discussion would reveal the fact; if it is not, it ou&apos;;ht to be thoroughly examined.Is it a fact that neither a district nor a national fund can be created except by the re-imposition of Severn-ment control with, possibly, a subsidy?   On the face of it, it would not appear to be necessarily so, for if the tvfo parties came to an agreement as to the creation of such a fund on a contributory basis, the power of both crganisa-tions would certainly seem to be sufficient to ensure its establishment and continuance.Clearly it would be bad to create a pool which would have the effect of encouraging bad management or slack work, or which would be in any way a handicap on efficiency. ITeither can there be any justification for the continuance of chronically unprofitable pits that are, and will remain, unable to provide a decent living wage for those evnloyed in them and a fair profit to those conducting them.- 1 -
On the other hand, it appears that there are many-captaine which in normal times would be profitable undertakingst hut which in the present abnormal oonditicne can cnly he worked at a less, or withcut profit, if a sufficient living wa,^e is to he paid to those employed in them.   These pits are national assets too valuable to he abandonee., and I oannot see hew their case is to be met except by the provision of outside assistance.It is to be remembered, also, that there is nothing constant in these matters.   A short time a;;o the Velsh Crllieries were the most profitable in the country; now they are in most cases, I believe, run without profit, or would be so if a living wage even cf the lowest standard wore to be paid.   With an alteration of the overseas demand their present conditions as compared with other collieries mi&apos;rht again be changed,We none of us want to see Government assistance per-petuate&apos;&quot;, and we all desire to on sure that any assistance which it may be necessary tc afford shall be of a temporary oharaoter, and as small as possible, and from this point of view it seems tc me that we could only gain by the examiirv-tion of the subject of a pool, and its possible establishment in no matter what form.-It is to be noted, toe, that a pool mi:;ht be used toprovide against other risks than these of low wages-, and-might form a sort cf insurance fund against other contingen-cieo in such a way as to benefit owners as well as men.-There are risks which affect the owner as well as the workman, and if it is possible for the men to contribute to a pool, it should be possible for the owners to 6.0 the same.
It appears to me, therefore, that real adv.xnta.vc3 would result from a careful and comprehensive e;;.ariination of this subject and there are able and independent accountants and statisticians whom I think we mi;ht well invite to explore it further, in the hope of their puttin.: for w: rd practical and helpful suggestions.I trust that my colleagues will not be disposed to reject such a suggestion even at this late hour.(Sgd.)   C. ADD!SON., Y/hitehall Gardens, S.*&apos;.&apos;. 1. 81st April, 1921.
