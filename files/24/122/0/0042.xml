PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The complete stoppage of work in all the coal mines of Great Britain remains the most important fact in the labour situation. During the week, however, the centre of interest has shifted from the stoppage itself, and the negotiations between miners and owners, to the possibility of the dispute being extended by sympathetic action on the part of the railwaymen and transport workers, who with the miners form the Triple Industrial Alliance. The two days of crisis during the week were Friday, the 8th April, and Tuesday, the 12!h, on which days the Triple Alliance made vital decisions on the question, of sym-pathetic action. On the 8th it was determined to call a strike of railwaymen and transport workers to take place on the night of the 12th, unless before that time negotiations were resumed between miners and owners. On the evening of the 12th, however, the strike was postponed &quot; until further instructions be issued.&quot; These movements of the Alliance had, of course, a reaction upon the narrower issue of the actual relations between coal owners and miners. After the decision of the 8th, a way was found for meetings between owners and miners on the 11th and 12th. These meetings did not bring any nearer the solution of the difference between miners and owners, on the question of national versus district variations in miners&apos; wages. Within an hour after the postponement of the sympathetic strike on the 12th, the miners determined to reject the basis of negotiations put forward by the Prime Minister, and the resultant decision of the railwaymen and transport workers on the 13th, to begin their sympathetic strike at 10 p.m. on Friday, the 15th, opened a new phase in the situation.Many resolutions from other trade unions expressing sympathy with the miners have been, reported, but suggestions of active mediation on the part of the national labour and trade union organisations had, up to the 12th, not been forthcoming.The main positive achievement of the week is the securing of the safety of the mines from flooding. The coal dispute has, of course, accentuated the already serious unemployment position in all industries. Its effects in this direction have been most noticeable in the pottery and iron and steel trades.Negotiations in the engineering and shipbuilding industries are slowly being brought into such a position that a definite decision will have to be made upon the question of wages reductions by the trade unions concerned.In the Scottish baking industry the question of national versus local wages agree-ments is developing in the same way as in the coal mining industry. The formation of a &quot; Trade Board Advisory Council&quot; under the auspices of the Parliamentary Com-mittee of the Trades Union Congress, and the conference between members of that committee and representatives of the trade unions connected with the woodworking trades, which are both mentioned below, are of importance as showing the kind of action which the Trades Union Congress may take on the general question of wages reductions. The strike of assistant elementary school teachers at Croydon has been settled, but it is reported that a similar trouble may occur at Reigate.The conference of unemployed organisations held in London on the 12th April marks the failure of this movement to achieve national importance.The Unemployment Position.Statistics.-Qn the 1st April, hi the United Kingdom, 1,450,000 unemployment books under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and out-of-work donation policies, remained lodged for workers totally unemployed, of which 1,020,600 were lodged by males and 429,400 by females. At the same date, 875,000 unemployment books and out-of-work donation policies remained lodged for workers on short time, of which
General Situation-continued,395,700 were lodged by males tmd 479,300 by females. The number of out-of-work donation policies iric luded in the totals for workers totally unemployed and for workers on short time is approximately 19,000 in each case.These figures show an increase in the previous week of approximately 88,900 totally unemployed, and 47,900 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 8th April was 1,615,000. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.The figure of 1,509,600 given last week as the total of the live registers was the total on the 1st April and not on the 25th March.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 354.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Unemployed Organisations. A conference of delegates from the various unemployed organisations* in London and the provinces was held at the International Socialist Club, London, on the 12th April. One of the main points for&apos;discussion was the need for a National Administrative Council to co-ordinate the work of the various organisations, but, after a long discussion, it was decided that, in view of the present lack of financial support, it was inadvisable to attempt to set up the Council.A number of resolutions were passed, among them the usual one dema ding &quot; work or full maintenance for the unemployed or partially unemployed at trade union rates of wages,&quot; and another demanding &quot; as a means of finding employment for the unemployed in the trades with which they are associated, the immediate putting into operation of the trading agreement with Russia, and the recognition of the Soviet Government.&quot;King18 National ZtoM.-The Minister of Labour stated in the House of Commons on the 6th April that the Government had decided that, save in very exceptional circumstance-stances, as from the 1st June, 1921, all firms contracting for Government contracts to whom the conditions for membership of the King&apos;s National Roll are applicable must be on the RollfEngineering Industry. A ballot is now being taken among members of the Amalga-mated Engineering Union on a proposal to increase the special unemployment levy from Is. to Is. Qd. per week per member,J in order that extra benefit may be available for unemployed members of the union.   The result is to be announced on the 27th April.Control of IndustryRailways. A conference under the auspices of the National Union of Railwaymen, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association (Western Divisional Council), was held at Bristol on the 2nd April, to discuss the nationalisation of railways. The conference was attended by 174 delegates. Mr. Emil Davies, chairman of the Eailway Nationalisation Society, London, moved a resolution in favour of State ownership and operation of the railways. A second resolution was proposed by Mr. Luke Bateman, of the National Union of Railwaymen, as follows :-&quot; That this conference is convinced that no national system of transport will be satisfactory unless the utmost use is made of the goodwill and knowledge of the workers engaged in the various undertakings comprising such system, and that this can only be secured by the workers taking a direct share in the management of the transport system, by means of representatives, nominated by them, upon the national and local boards of management, in the manner prescribed in the Railway Nationalisation Society&apos;s draft Bill.&quot;* These organisations should be distinguished, on the one hand, from the local bodies attached to the Labour Party and kindred organisations, and, on the other, from the various associations for ex-Service men. See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 5, 29th January, p. 100, and No. 3, 15th January, p. 45.f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rd October, p. 482.j See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 3, 15th January, p. 47.(B 17220T) 2 Y 2
Features of the Week-continued.After a general discussion, in which great stress Was laid on the opinion that the first charge on any industry should be a living wage for the workers, both resolutions were adopted.General Topics.Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.-As a result of the national stoppage of work in coal mines the problem has arisen whether the miners are eligible for benefit under this Act. Numbers of miners, actine: on the instructions of their various countv associations, applied to the local Employment Exchanges for unemployment benefit. The Employment Exchanges, acting on the instructions of the Chief Insurance Officer, refused unemployment benefit to the men, and the cases were then referred to the various Courts of Referees for the districts, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The claims were in every instance disallowed, on the ground that the men were unemployed owing to a trade dispute, and therefore were not eligible for assistance under the Act, and notices of appeal were at once lodged on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.The appeals were duly referred to the Umpire, and test eases were heard by him on the 7th and 8th April.  The grounds of the appeal in the principal test case were as follows : (1) That the insured contributor was unable at all material times to obtain suitable employment, in that tho only offer of employment in the district where he was last usually employed was at a rate of wage lower than that habitually obtained in usual employment in that district, or would have obtained had he continued to be so employed.(2) That the insured contributor did not lose his employment by reason of a stoppage of work, which was due to a trade dispute at the mine at which he was employed, in that the employers gave notice terminating the contract of the insured contributor, apart from any trade dispute, and only offered him employment at a rate of wage lower than that which he habitually obtained in his usual employment or would have obtained had lie continued to be so employed.(3) That the provisions of Section VII (3) and (b) of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) are affected by the fact that the refusal to offer employment except at a rate of wage lower than that which the insured contributor habitually obtained in his ordinary employment in that district, or, would have obtained had he continued to be so employed, was a concerted refusal by a number of employers and not an individual refusal.The decision of the Umpire was against the appeal, on the ground that the notices from the employers to the applicants, terminating existing engagements on the 31st March, contained an invitation to negotiate through the workmen&apos;s representatives for the continuance of work without interruption on the expiry of the notice. The facts that the offer to negotiate regarding fresh terms was made and was not accepted, and that work ceased on the expiry of the existing engagements, constituted a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute, and, therefore the applicants were not eligible for unemployment benefit under the existing regulations of the Act.Industrial Courts.Act, 1919. The question of the effect of an award under this Act upon existing contracts of employment has recently arisen, in Scotland, in the case of Mrs. Jessie Ogilvie, an employee of Messrs. J. Browning &amp; Co., hosiery manufacturers, who sued her employers for payment of an increase of wages granted under an award. The parties to the arbitration proceedings resulting in the award were the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association, of which the firm were members, and, among other unions, the Workers&apos; Union, of which Mrs. Ogilvie was a member. The award granted, inter alia, an increase of 15 per cent, on piece-work prices. This advance was not paid, and legal proceedings took place to enforce the award.The firm argued that the action was incompetent; that there was no title to sue; and that the award was ultra vires and the action should therefore be dismissed.In giving his decision in favour of Mrs. Ogilvie, the Sheriff stated that since the statute is silent as to the mode in which the awards of the Industrial Courts instituted by it are to be enforced, the parties whose interest it is to enforce them must have recourse to the ordinary courts of justice. He held that the parties, having agreed to a reference to the Industrial Court, entered into a contract to accept the award, and the defendant firm were bound to give effect to the terms of the award in regard to the work done by the plaintiff under her contract of service, and that they had no means of escaping their liability to pay the increase awarded ; that either party might perhaps have rendered the award of no avail by giving the customary notice to terminate the contract, but, until that was done, or the contract otherwise came to an end, the award was binding on them. He further stated that the Industrial Court in their award did not go beyond the claim made on behalf of the plaintiff, nor did they act in any way ultra vires.
Features of the Week-continued.Trade Boards Acts. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, at a special conference of unions and representatives on the Trade Boards, held at Caxton Hall on the 5tli April, established&apos;a Trade Board Advisory Council. An executive committee for the council was appointed, consisting of Mr. E. L. Poulton, chairman, Mr. A. Smith and Miss M. Bondfield, appointed by the Parliamentary Committee, and representatives of several trade unions, with Mr. J. J. Mallon as secretary. The Advisory Council will specialise on questions affecting the interests of workers covered by Trade Boards. They will act under the supervision of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and will make joint representations on behalf of the unions concerned to the Government or other bodies exercising influence and control over the Trade Boards regula-tions or activities.The conference passed the following resolution: &quot; This conference strongly condemns the action of the Government in delaying the setting up of the new Trade Boards, and crippling the Trade Board administration by the dismissal of two-thirds of the investigators at a time when millions of lowly paid workers stand in the direst need of protection. It points out that on the ground of economy alone the dismissal of persons engaged in highly technical work, before their investigation is complete, involves a serious waste, and as a matter of general policy it regards the action of the Government as a capitulation to sinister political pressure. The conference hereby calls upon the Government to expedite the setting up of the board under consideration, and to re-engage immediately adequate staffs for this purpose.&quot;Industrial and Other Organisations.Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Controlling Officers&apos; Association. At the annual conference of this association held at Cardiff from the 2nd to the 6th April, various questions relating to conditions of service and rates of pay were discussed. It was unanimously decided that the executive council should press for a decision of the 7-hour day question, or endeavour to refer the matter to arbitration. A resolution was also passed declaring that all full-time servants in the Post Office should be pensionable, and that the age for retiring should be 60 years. It was decided that an effort should be made to improve materially the basic salaries of all indoor supervising officers. The executive were urged to press for the immediate settlement of the necessary adjustments in the scales of pay of the supervising classes in view of the increased maxima of the &quot; rank and file staffs &quot; which have been effective since January, 1920. It was also decided to press for improved scales of pay for telephone supervisors.National Rate and Tax Payers&apos; Association. This association has been formed to deal with the question of rates and taxes.  The programme is as follows : &quot; To work for economy in State and local government and to uphold the cause of the tax and rate payer; to work for a National Budget strictly witbin the taxable capacity of the country and regardless of the schemes of political visionaries ; to support the Government in securing reparation from Germany with a view to alleviating the burdens of the tax-payer; and to afford information to members, and to furnish legal and technical assistance on matters touching the rates and taxes they are called on to pay.&quot;An endeavour is to be made to form branches throughout the country, and it is proposed ultimately to unite the various rate-payers&apos; associations in one active organisation.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Engineers (National). The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations have notified the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades that it is the intention of the Federations to intimate, at the resumed conference of the two bodies at York on the 14th April,* a general reduction in the wages of the workers in the employment of federated firms, amounting to 6s. a week in the case of time-workers, and 15 per cent, in the case of piece-workers, together with per cent, on earnings in the case of time-workers and 7j per cent, on earnings in the case of workers working under systems of payment by results.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations met the executive of the Amalgamated Engineering Union at York on the 7th April, to discuss the questions of overtime, the manning of machines, and apprentices. No agreement on these matters Avas reached, and the conference was adjourned.Women in the Engineering &quot;Trades (National).-Representatives of unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers were also in conference on the 8th April with the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations, upon the subject of wages of women workers employed in the engineering trades. The proposals of the employers provide for a basic rate, to which will be added an amount subject to quarterly fluctuations according to the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number. The union representatives declined to accept the proposals, and adjourned to report the position to their executives and members.Nut and Bolt Operatives (Midlands). A conference between the employers and the unions concerned was held on the 4th April to discuss the wages of male and female workers. As regards womens&apos; wages, no progress towards a settlement was made, perhaps in view of the national meeting referred to in the preceding paragraph.In the case of the men, however, the employers modified their form of proposals, agreeing for the present to suspend the question of a reduction in time-workers&apos; rates, but insisting upon a 10 per cent, reduction in piece-work prices, which they announced would be in operation as from the 6th and 7th April. The unions did not formally agree to the reduction, but it is not anticipated by the officials that any stoppage of work will follow its inception.Shipbuilders (National). It is understood that a provisional agreement has been made for a further conference between the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the trade unions to be held at Carlisle on the 19th April.*Woodworkers (National). On the 4th April the London members of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress conferred with representatives of various branches of the woodworking industry on the subject of wages reductions. The feeling was that any re-adjustment in wages should be on a national, rather than on a local basis, and sub-committee was appointed to open up negotiations with the employers. The two following paragraphs indicate some of the facts which add importance to this conference.Sawmillers (Birmingham). Employers in the Birmingham area have given notice of their intention, under Clause 3 of the wages agreement of May, 1920, to invite the representatives of the workers to a conference on the wages question. The clause referred to provides that an alteration in the terms shall take place only by the giving of one month&apos;s notice on either side. The proposal affects approximately 1,000 workers in Birmingham, Walsall, Oldbury, West Bromwich and Smethwick.Backing-Case Makers (Scotland). At a conference held in Glasgow on the 30th March between the Scottish Employers National Federation of Packing Case Makers, and the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists, the employers intimated their intention to reduce the current rates by 20 per cent, as from the beginning of the third pay in April. They also proposed the introduction of a sliding scale on the basis of the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number. No agreement was arrived at, and the conference was adjourned.Chemical Workers (Scotland). The Scottish Committee of Chemical Manufacturers, who act independently of the Industrial Council for the chemical trades, have intimated to the unions concerned, namely, the Workers&apos; Union, the National Union of General Workers, the National Amalgamated Union of Labour and the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers, that it is intended, as from, and including, the pay period ending on the 23rd April to reduce wages by 6s. per week plus 12-  per cent. Two conferences have been held during the week, but the endeavour of the workers&apos; representatives to secure some modifi-cation of the proposal met with no success.Bakers (Scotland).-Th.e ballot vote of the Scottish Operative Bakers&apos; Union, referred to in last week&apos;s Report, has resulted, by 5,506 votes to 760 votes, in favour of a strike to begin on the 23rd April, to enforce the principle of a national wages agreement..The executive committee of the National Master Bakers&apos; Association decided to convene a special meeting of the employers&apos; representatives on the Industrial Council, on the 11th April, and to submit a strong recommendation that a meeting of the Council should be convened immediately.* See also p. 350 below.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued. Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). The national stoppage in the coal-mining industry, which commenced on the night of the 31st March, continues.On the 7th April a conference took place between the Government and the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain with a view to re-opening the negotiations between the miners and the owners, but it proved abortive. The miners would not agree to order the safety men to resume duty as a preliminary to further negotiations ; the Government, on the other hand, insisted that, before any progress could be made, the safety of the mines must be secured.On the night of the 7th April, the Prime Minister made a further proposal, to the effect that miners and owners should meet, confining themselves, in the first place, to the subject of withdrawing the embargo on pumpmen and ensuring the safety of the mines. This, however, the miners declined to do, and, on the night of the 8th, the Triple Alliance decided that, unless unconditional negotiations were re-opened between the miners and owners, the full strike power of the Alliance should be put into operation as from midnight on the 12th.As a result, however, of several conferences held on the 9th April, between the Govern-ment and the leaders of the railwaymen and transport workers, the Miners&apos; Federation issued a notice to all their branches to abstain from all action which would interfere with the measures necessary to secure the safety of the mines, or which would necessitate the use of force by the Government. It was thus made possible for the owners and the miners to meet on the 11th April at the Board of Trade under the presidency of the Prime Minister. At this meeting each side stated their case, and the conference adjourned until the next morning, in order that the Prime Minister might study the statements.At this resumed conference, on the 12th, the Government offered to give assistance, either by a loan or otherwise, during a short period to mitigate the rapid reduction in wages in the districts most severely affected, if and when the owners and miners had arranged the rates of wages to be paid, fixed upon an economic basis. This offer, however, the miners&apos; executive did not see their way to accept. But forty minutes before their formal decision was taken, the strike of railwaymen and transport workers called by the Triple Alliance, however, which was due to begin at midnight on the 12th, was suspended, &quot; until further instructions be issued.&quot;Shipyard Joiners (National).-Individual members of the Clyde Shipbuilders&apos; Associa-tion have intimated to the parents or guardians of those apprentice joiners who have identified themselves with the shipyard joiners&apos; dispute, that unless the apprentices return to work immediately they will not be allowed to resume work on the termination of the dispute. Further, in cases where a form of agreement has been concluded between the parents or guardians and the firm concerned, legal action may be contemplated. As a result, a considerable proportion of the apprentices have returned to work. Apart from this, there has been no material alteration in the position.Waterproof Garment Workers (Manchester). There is no change in the position regarding the stoppage of work by the waterproof garment workers, except that the employees of Messrs. David Moseley &amp; Co., Manchester, are stated to be working at reduced rates. It is reported, however, that the firm are experiencing difficulty in retaining labour, owing to very close picketing by the Amalgamated Tailors and Garment Workers&apos; Union. The Secretary of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association is of opinion that there will be a general secession from the union, and that work will be resumed at the reduced rate.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department&apos;s seption of the Report, pages 350 to 353.]
PART II.-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.engineering, shipbuilding and allied trades.Shipbuilding Industry: Wages Negotiations. In connection with the unions&apos; request for intervention by the Ministry * to avoid a stoppage in the last week in April, the Minister, on the 5th April, saw informally representatives of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, and, on the 7th April, representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation.  Further meetings were arranged for the 13th April.Surgical Instrument Manufacture (Walton-on-Thames). Messrs. Claudius Ash, Sons, &amp; Co., Ltd., gave notice to reduce wages by 33^ per cent., and offered instead to institute a bonus system for a full working week of 47 liours. In consequence, 40 members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union ceased work on the 1st April. The firm have recently resigned their membership of the Surgical Instrument Manufacturers&apos; Association. At a meeting of the London District Council of the Joint Industrial Council, on the 6th April, it was agreed that the association, who form the employers&apos; side, should press the firm to reconsider their position.   The firm, however, have confirmed their resignation.woodworking and furnishing.Upholsterers (London). A further conference, under the chairmanship of a Conciliation Officer, was held in connection with the disputef at the works of Messrs. Hart &amp; Sons, on the 4th April. The principal question was whether the pre-war rates were subject to the addition of one increment of 10 per cent., or two such increments, before the addition of the war bonus of 123^ per cent. It was eventually agreed that the parties should submit to their respective associations the following suggestion : That, if the second 10 per cent, unofficial advance on piece-work alleged to have been applied in January, 1918, was generally paid in the trade in the East End, the Federation shall acknowledge it as a legitimate advance.That an employer whose wages-book shows that the rate paid by him exceeded the pre-war log price plus 10 per cent, plus 10 per cent, plus 123  per cent., shall be deemed to have paid this 10 per cent, unofficial advance, and will not be expected to pay more than this total figure.It was decided that the men employed by the firm should resume work on the basis of the price of July, 1914, plus 10 per cent., plus the official advance of 123-1- per cent., the men to retain 25 per cent, of the difference between that total and the present total price paid.building and works of construction.Plumbers and Heating Engineers: Demarcation Dispute. A meeting of the Heating and Domestic Engineering Joint Industrial Council was held in Birmingham on the 5th April. The workers&apos; side reported that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress had now stated that their decision with regard to the Manchester demarcation-tion dispute was limited to that particular dispute. $ It was reported that work was proceeding on the Manchester housing schemes, the plumbers working under the super-vision of heating engineers. It appears that the heating engineers&apos; union have tacitly accepted the decision as regards Manchester, as their representatives signed an agreement to be bound by the Parliamentary Committee&apos;s decision, though this was contrary to their instructions.The Council decided that a meeting of the Emergency Committee should be called to consider the position.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 15, 9th April, p. 331, and p. 348 above, j See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p.*316.

quarrying.Artificial Stone. The annual meeting oi&apos; the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 6th April. The chairman gave notice that the employers&apos; side intended to propose at the next meeting, which was fixed for the 4th May, that wages should be reduced by Ifd per hour.food and drink.Bakers (Hull). The eight men whose dismissal led to the agreement respecting the re-introduction of night work* now refuse to resume work with any but their old employer. The men who were imported to take their places refuse to leave their jobs, and decline the union&apos;s offer to pay the expense of returning. The union have therefore given seven days&apos; notice to terminate the agreement permitting night work, but have agreed to discuss matters with the employers.Cocoa, Chocolate, Sugar Confectionery arid Jam.-A meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee was held on the 4th April to consider a wages proposal for the cocoa and chocolate section, which had already been approved by the panel for this section. The workers agreed to the withdrawal of half their last wages increase, a reduction of 6s. 3d. for male piece-workers, 5s. for male time-workers, and 3s. for women, with equiva-lent reductions for juveniles. It was also agreed to consider at a later date further reductions of 2s. Gd. and Is. 6rf., to operate on the 1st August and the 1st November, respectively, for all workers, unless trade had very much improved by those dates.transport.Road Transport (Scotland). The Scottish Carting Contractors&apos; and Horse Owners&apos; Federation recently intimated to the Scottish Horse and Motormen&apos;s Association a proposal to increase the working week from 48 to 54 hours or, alternatively, to reduce wages by 9s. per week. At a meeting of the Industrial Council, on the 6th April, it was agreed that wages should be reduced by 3s. per week from the 11th April, with a further reduction of 2s. when the cost-of-living index number falls to 130, and a subsequent reduction of Is. for each decline of five points in the cost of living.pottery, rubber and glass.Glass. The Anti-Dumping Sub-Committee of the Joint Industrial Council on the 8th April passed a resolution pressing for the inclusion, in the proposed Ways and Means Resolution, of electric lamp bulbs and other glassware essential to the employment of an illuminant.Rubber. At an interview on the 24th March a representative of the India Rubber Manufacturers&apos; Association stated that the executive committee were strongly opposed to the suggested conference with the unions respecting the reconstitution of the Industrial Council. He agreed, however, that employers and trade unions would have to meet again in connection with coming reductions, and that the Council formed the best means of &quot;doing so.textiles.Hosiery Workers (Calverton). About 170 employees of Messrs. Coggan &amp; Co. are still on strike against a reduction of the bonus, of Is. Zd. on each Is. of wages, by 3d., instead of by Id. in accordance with the Hosiery Industrial Council&apos;s sliding scale agreement. The firm, who seceded from the Nottingham Employers&apos; Federation about a year ago, are not now members of any association. They claim to have plenty of work in hand. They have welcomed the assistance of the Chief Conciliation Officer, but will not meet the union officials.The union officials are now insisting that the firm shall pay the same basic rates as are paid in Nottingham, in addition to the bonus agreed upon by the Council. The firm decline absolutely to consider this demand. The union is prepared to support the workers to the fullest possible extent.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 13, 26th March, p. 293, and No. 14, 2nd April, p. 317.

Industrial Relations Department-continued.printing and paper.Printing. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 6th April. The Newspaper Society were not represented, as they had declined the offer of four seats, and were claiming eight. The General Purposes Committee were instructed to continue negotiations with a view to getting them to attend the next meeting. The Council decided to urge the Govera-ment to ignore benefits received through trade unions and friendly societies when calculating the amount payable under the Old Age Pensions Act. Owing to the large amount of unemployment in the trade, it was decided to hold a special meeting of the Council in the near future to deal solely with this question. It was reported that 117 firms had failed to pay the 5s. advance in wages granted in November last. The employers expressed willingness to expel these firms from their federation, if the workers so desired, in the event of failure to observe the decisions of the Conciliation Committee, who have not yet heard the cases.public authorities and public utility services.Electricity Supply. Negotiations have been proceeding between a sub-committee of the Electricity Committee of the York Town Council and representatives of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association in regard to the schedule of salaries and conditions of employ-ment recommended by the National Joint Board of Employers and Staff Members. A substantial basis of agreement was reached, but the Town Council rejected the recom-mendations of the sub-committee by a two to one majority. The Town Council met again in committee on the 4th April to consider the situation, when Sir David Shackleton attended. The Council again decided, by 16 votes to 12, to reject the recommendations.Tramways. The Standing Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 6th April. Matters in dispute, arising out of the agreement of March, 1919, referred from Birmingham, Norwich, Dundee, Brighton, Portsmouth, Rawtenstall and Wallasey, were considered, and decisions reached, except in the case of Portsmouth, in which a decision was deferred to the next meeting.Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales). At an adjourned conference held at Rhyl on the 8th April, to consider further the formation of a Provincial Council for the North Wales area, it was reported that, of the 78 local authorities in the area, only 10 had indicated their intention to be represented at the conference. It was unanimously resolved that the proposal to form a Provincial Council be deferred until a more opportune time.Gas Workers (Southend). A strike occurred, without previous notice, at the works of the Southend Gas Co., on the 1st April, following the company&apos;s refusal to pay the rates of wages under the National Awards. The department got into touch with the parties immediately, and an agreement was reached on the 8th April, the men resuming on the evening of that day.miscellaneous trades.Glove Making. A meeting of the Industrial Council was held on the 2nd April to discuss a new wages agreement. In July, 1919, a national agreement fixing minimum time-rates was drawn up. Since that date advances totalling 22  per cent, have been given in the leather section, while varying bonuses have been paid in the fabric section, some districts paying 17J per cent, and others 12J. The unions eventually agreed that, in the leather section, a percentage bonus of 12j per cent, should be paid, and that in the fabric section the rates paid should be those adopted in accordance with the national agreement without any percentage bonus. This agreement will stand until the 30th June.Co-operative Workers (Dumfries, Maxwelltown and Castle Douglas).-A strike of co-operative employees in Dumfries, Maxwelltown and Castle Douglas took place on the 7th April owing to the refusal of the Dumfries and Maxwelltown Co-operative Society to discuss an application for a new scale of wages and conditions of labour, made last year by the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.At a third joint meeting, at which an officer of the department was present, the suggestion of comparing the claim with Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award was adopted. It was ascer-tained that the total amount of advances under the award would be  35 14s.The union officials were willing that the matter should be referred to Sheriff Fyfe for determination, but the directors wished to consult their shareholders before taking
Industrial Relations Department-continued.any further action. Arbitration before the Industrial Court was also agreed to by the union but refused by the directors. A strike therefore took place, which was settled, however, two days later, the directors agreeing to pay in accordance with Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award.Gas Mantles.-Consequent upon the serious position alleged to. have arisen in the gas mantle industry, as a result of its exclusion from the list of trades covered by the Ways and Means Resolution for the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, an emergency meeting of the Council was held on the 6th April, to consider steps to secure the inclusion of the industry. The chairman stated that unless this was accomplished, the manufac-turers could see no alternative to closing down.  The following steps were agreed upon : That mass meetings of the workers should be held in Wandsworth and Stockport, with the respective local member of Parliament in the chair, with the object of obtaining signatures for a petition to Parliament.That a circular should be sent out to members of Parliament from the Council pointing out that, from statements made during the war, it was understood that the industry would be placed among the protected industries ;That a deputation of the workpeople&apos;s representatives should wait on the Labour members of Parliament;That an executive committee should be formed to carry out these proposals, and to frame a telegram to be sent to the Prime Minister.A proposal that the Minister of Labour be requested to receive a deputation, to draw attention to the serious position of the industry, was carried unanimously.general.Growing Industry (Guernsey). The department have been in communication with the Home Office on an&apos; application for recognition received from the recently formed council for the Growing Industry in Guernsey. A letter has been sent to the chairman of the Council, stating that, while the Minister is not in a position to give formal recognition to the Council in the same way as to Joint Industrial Councils in the United Kingdom, the Home Government is prepared to regard the Council as representative of the growing industry in Guernsey and as a channel of communication in appropriate cases, through the Governor, between the Home Government and the industry.Ministry of Munitions Acts. An Order in Council dated the 24th March, 1921, issued under Section 6 of the Ministry of Munitions Act, 1915, and Section 1 of the Ministries of Munitions and Shipping (Cessation) Act, 1921, has the effect, inter alia, of rendering inoperative as from the 1st April, 1921, Section 3 of the Munitions of War Act, 1917, which, subject to certain conditions, required a week&apos;s notice to terminate a contract of employment on munitions work, or an average week&apos;s wages in lieu thereof.*[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 344 to 349, 353 and 354.]GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. proceedings.General Wuste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain).-T]iQ Board resumed consideration of the question of proposing to fix minimum rates for male workers in the trade, and also considered a letter from the Ministry with reference to the matter of the confirmation of the minimum rates fixed for female workers. In view, however, of the time at which the letter was received and the industrial crisis which had arisen the Board resolved to defer further consideration of the above matters.(u 17220T)2Z 2
General Department-continued.Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board resolved to issue a notice of proposal to vary the existing minimum rates by reducing certain of the rates for female learners in the branches of the trade other than the wholesale and retail cloth hat and cap trade.Milk Distributive Trade Board (Scotland). At a meeting held on the 7th April, the Board agreed, after considering a letter from the Ministry intimating that the Minister was unable to confirm the rates as fixed by the Board, to issue a fresh Notice of Proposal to fix minimum rates for male and female workers in the trade, the proposed general minimum time-rates to be twelve-thirteenths of the general minimum time-rates already proposed, and based on a week of 48 hours. The overtime rates to be proposed are, substantially, on the same basis as those already proposed, except that, in the case of the first four hours of overtime worked in excess of 48 hours, the general minimum time-rates shall apply, and that, in the case of Sunday and customary public and statutory holidays, the normal number of hours to be declared shall be 4.Sugar, Confectionery and Food Preserving Trade Board (Great Britain).-Proposals put forward by the workers&apos; and employers&apos; sides, respectively, for increases and decreases of the present minimum rates of wages were withdrawn after statements had been made by the representatives of the respective sides.After considering a letter from the Ministry with regard to the scope of the Board and the proposed application of the Acts to certain food trades not already covered, the Board decided to inform the Minister that any proposal to subdivide the present Board would in their view increase, rather than diminish, the difficulties of administering the Act and would add to the expense, and such proposal would be strongly opposed. The Board proposed, however, to go into the whole matter in detail, and requested the Minister meanwhile to take no action on the lines suggested in his letter.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on page 347.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.employment exchanges.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 1st April:-	Men.	,Women.

The situation has been overshadowed by the commencement of the dispute in the coal industry, and there is already evidence of stagnation produced by the cessation of work in the mines. The main alterations in the position during the week are noted below.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued. Men&apos;s Employment.Iron and Steel. Reports from Scotland indicate that most works will close down at an early date. On the Tyne 2,000 workers are affected by the closing of a steel works at Newburn. On the Tees most firms have been compelled to close down owing to insufficiency of coal stocks. In the Sheffield district the number of workers at present affected is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000, and at Scunthorpe the number is approximately 5,500.In South Wales the whole of the establishments of the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron &amp; Coal Co., Ltd.,have closed down, and in North Wales, the Hawarden Bridge Steel Works, Shotton, employing 6,000 workmen, have also closed down. At Accrington a large engineering firm have discharged 2,000 men as a preliminary step to closing down entirely. In the Furness district, the Hodbarrow works employing 600 to 700 men are closed, and the North Lonsdale Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., Ulverston, are expected to close at any moment.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries. On the Clyde the effects of the joiners&apos; strike are becoming more pronounced week by week, and the number of unemployed shipyard iron-workers continues to grow steadily ; a large number of men have, however, been absorbed during the week on a large repair job in one of the yards. The position at Jarrow is said to be slightly better. It is stated that at Sunderland, for the first quarter of the year, the output was only seven vessels with a total gross tonnage of 24,160, against 14 vessels and 66,586 tons for the corresponding period last year.On the Mersey two or three general ship-repairing firms at Bootle have been busy during the week. Here again the incidence of the joiners&apos; strike is preventing work coming to the yards, and the loss to the Port of Liverpool owing to the strike is estimated to be more than  1,000,000 in wages alone.Textiles and Clothing. Reports from the cotton industry indicate more cheerful conditions than for many months past. It is stated that there has been a distinct improvement in the demand for cotton goods, and the opinion is fairly general in trade circles that a turn towards better times has been made. It would be unwise, however, to expect any sudden decline in unemployment.Dundee report a more optimistic feeling in regard to the jute trade-in the boot and shoe trade, conditions generally continue to improve, and the number of factories closing down for an extended holiday period was less than was anticipated.Miscellaneous Trades.-The coal stocks of pottery manufacturers are reported to be light, and in consequence there is very little prospect of a general resumption of work after the extended holiday, pending a settlement of the coal dispute. The fire-brick trade is also threatened with an immediate stoppage, as the clay miners are involved in the coal stoppage.In the fishing industry at Great Yarmouth, the position is still precarious, and upwards of 370 fishermen, including enginemen and firemen, are unemployed. On the other hand the resumption of fishing at Lowestoft has substantially improved the position at that place.The glass bottle industry at St. Helens is now reported to be affected, and many dis-charges and suspensions are being made by employers, who have been carrying on by manufacturing for stock.The only improvement in the factory areas in the Metropolitan district is reported from Shepherd&apos;s Bush, where Messrs. Qlement-Talbot, Ltd., motor engineers, who for the past three months have been working on short time with a depleted staff of about 200, have resumed full-time working. About 70 of their old employees have been re-engaged during the week, and the firm expect to reinstate more men each week. The situation in regard to painters reverses that which usually obtains during this period of the year, the supply being considerably in excess of the demand. There is also very little outlet at present for general builders&apos; labourers.Transport. On the Mersey general cargo on all the main routes is scarce, and the export trade outlook is very uncertain. Hope is expressed, however, that the opening of navigation in the Baltic and the St. Lawrence will add materially to the absorption of the unemployed in this industry. In South Wales transport workers, including coal trimmers, are already suffering from the coal stoppage.Women&apos;s Employment.Local Reports.--ln the North-Western Division better reports as to the future have been received from Accrington, Darwen, Nelson, and Tyldesley. At Leigh several mills would have been re-openecl but for the mining crisis, but, as it is, the conditions are worse. Liver-pool report that unemployment is worse than for many years, and practically every industry
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.is severely affected. At St. Helens there is severe unemployment in the shirt making, rug-making, underclothing and wire goods making industries.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, a live register of over 8,000 is reported from Leeds, in addition to nearly 2,000 short-time workers. A large number of tailoresses are unemployed in this town.In the West Midlands Division the effects of the coal strike are being quickly felt in engineering and pottery. At Hanley practically all potteries are closing. At Burslem there is a large increase in short time in the industry, at Stoke-on-Trent and at Longton many firms are closing. In the engineering centres serious unemployment is also reported. In Birmingham and Aston the live registers are rapidly increasing, and unemployment is abnormal in the cycle and motor industries at Sparkhill. At Smethwick there is much unemployment in iron and steel rolling, and in general engineering, and in screw, nut and bolt manufacturing. The claims of married women to unemployment insurance are being specially investigated by this Exchange.In London increasing numbers of claims and of applicants on the live register are reported. At Bermondsey, where the leather, tailoring, shirt and collar industries are depressed, the register stands at over 3,000, in addition to 1,000 short-time workers.There is general depression in the brickyards, ropeworks and textile factories of the Northern Division.In Scotland slight improvements are reported from certain centres. In Dumbarton, however, textile workers are being paid off. At Galashiels depression in the woollen and hosiery trade is more acute. At Edinburgh the live register is stated to be higher than at any period since the payment of out-of-work donation to civilians.local employment committees.Unemployment Insurance. In connection with the Unemployment Insurance Act, committees continue to raise points of difficulty. Ilkeston are of opinion that juveniles who have attained the age of 16 and can prove employment in an insured trade for 20 weeks since the 31st December, 1919, should be regarded as eligible for benefit, whether the employment was before the age of 16 years or not. Hastings suggest that action should be taken to increase unemployment benefit for men to 30s., with a corresponding improvement for women and juveniles.The Macclesfield Committee, being informed that several young women silk-workers had had their unemployment benefit suspended because they refused to accept employment as domestic servants, expressed the opinion that the Employment Exchange officials had exceeded their duty, in so far as it was unjust to transfer contributors from an insured to an uninsured occupation, thus depriving them of future benefits.Housing. A deputation from the Carlisle Committee who recently visited the Gretna Factory, among other recommendations, urge that the brick buildings previously used as hostels should be immediately converted into cottages, in view of the urgent demand for houses. They are of opinion that the conversion of each hostel into three cottages is practicable at a reasonable cost.discharged and disabled sailors and soldiers.National Scheme. Up to and including the 5th April, 24,803 certificates have been issued to employers under the Scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 275,608 disabled ex-Service men.The number of disabled men registered for employment at the Employment Exchanges in Great Britain, despite the continuance of. trade depression, has slightly decreased during March. On the 18th March, the number was 19,564 as compared with 19,647 on the 18th February.juvenile branch.Co-operation with Teachers. A deputation of the Swindon Juvenile Advisory Com-mittee recently attended a conference of head teachers organised by the Education Committee. Emphasis was laid on the value of the medical reports in assisting the com-mittee to give sound advice about employment and in deciding as to the need for after-care. The school medical officer undertook that in future the committee should receive a medical report in every case where it would assist them.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Unemployed Juveniles. Many committees are continuing the efforts they made at the end of the Christmas term to induce children who are due to leave school to remain on until employment has been found.Two centres for unemployed juveniles, one for boys and one for girls, are being opened in Norwich with the approval of the Board of Education. Each centre will accommodate 120 iuveniles.After-care (Glasgow). The newly constituted Juvenile Advisory Committees are making energetic efforts to place after-care on a sound footing. The policy followed is to concentrate industrial after-care at the Exchanges, where boys and girls requiring advice about employment are interviewed by rota committees, while the social side is being left, as far as possible, to clubs and organisations for juveniles, a central after-care committee being responsible for co-ordination. The development of boys&apos; and girls&apos; clubs in con-nection with the schools is being actively pursued. It is hoped that the Central Juvenile Advisory Committee may induce the education authority to waive the charge for the use of school halls.\ Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 344 to 346, and 358.]APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.appointments.Statistics. During the week ending the 1st April the department placed 274 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 52,836. Of these, 7,004 have been placed through the agency of the departments Inter-viewing Boards. Applications were registered from 632 ex-Service men and 23 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 1st April was 10,705 ex-Service men and 1,215 civilians. At the same date, 959 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 313 having been registered during the week.business  and  professional training.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 1st April, the department received 46 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applica-tions to 3,046, of which 1,093 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 666 cases. At the same date 306 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 22 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The department have dealt with a total of 1,139 cases, in 489 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 312 cases and abandoned training in 46 ;. 117 are still in training, and 14 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. industrial training.Disabled and other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 5th April 24,502 men were in training, as against 24,628 on the 29th March and 24,798 on the 8th March. During the week 291 men were placed in training. There were 16,604 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 29th March and the 8th March being 16,428 and 16,418. The number of men whose training had been com-pleted since the 1st August, 1919, was 29,219, the totals for the 29th March and the 8th March being 28,802 and 27,543.The, increase in the waiting list is accounted for by a further slight rise in London, Ireland and Yorkshire. The first two divisions make up approximately 45 per cent, of the grand total of 16,604. In the remaining divisions, the numbers vary from 1,636 in the . South-Eastern Division to 146 in Wales.
Appointments and Training-continued,Hostels and Canteens. In the earlier days of the Garrison Lane Factory at Birmingham the canteen showed a considerable loss ; and it was finally decided that the canteen must be closed altogether. The men, however, were so anxious that it should be continued that they undertook both the management and the financial responsibility. The premises and equipment were handed over to a committee of the men last summer on a three months&apos; trial.   The experiment is reported to have proved completely successful.Government Instructional Factories. There has been an increase during the past week of 52 in the number of men on the rolls, and the total has now reached 10,785. In the North-Western Division the policy of concentrating training in the Government Instruc-tional Factories is progressing steadily, and 45 per cent, of the men in training in this division are now in Government Instructional Factories.An exhibition of the work of trainees from the eastern counties was opened at Ipswich in the 4th April, and has proved a great success. The visitors have included many employers of labour, who have expressed appreciation of the high quality of the work exhibited. Several orders have already been taken by the Clayclon and Norwich Factories.Improver ship Vacancies ^Progress is reported by the officers of the Interrupted Apprenticeship Branch, in the West Midlands, where the vacancies that have already been found cover a great variety of trades. Messrs. Doulton &amp; Co., Ltd., pottery manufacturers, for instance, have agreed to accept eight trainees. The tailoring trade has received special attention.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 6th April agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,084 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 44,001 apprentices employed by 17,501 employers. The total number of agree-ments lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 22,299.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance-At the works of Messrs. Howard &amp; Bullough, Ltd., Accrington, engineers, the workpeople objected to the scheme, thinking that only the employers would benefit by its adoption. Negotiations which have been proceeding for some time with the workers&apos; committee, mainly as regards the period of time to be served by certain demobilised apprentices, have ended in an agreement to bring these apprentices under the scheme.  The firm will pay full rates and reclaim the State grant.Unemployment. Distinct advantage during the present depression of trade has accrued from the scheme in certain firms in the London and South-Eastern area, who state that they could not have retained their apprentices&apos; services but for the assistance given by the State.Institutional Training. In the London and South-Eastern area applications for technical instruction in the evenings have been received from apprentices, who hope ultimately to find employment at their own trade, but have so far been unsuccessful, and from others at present working at then own trade, but with employers who will not bring them under the scheme. Owing to the long period of unemployment, many are not in a position to pay even the nominal fees for an evening school course.At Oldham help has been given by the local education committee in the formation of the special class for fitters and turners at the technical school. The class is reported to be working satisfactorily.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. At the inaugural meeting of the Manchester, Salford and District Apprenticeship Committee, held on the 16th March, a resolution was passed requesting the local educational authorities to elect three representatives, including one specially connected with technical instruction and one connected with the Juvenile Employ-ment Bureau. A local officer of the department was invited to act as secretary to the committee. The first meeting of the committee for Whitehaven will be on the 17th May, and arrangements are in progress for the sister committee at Workington and Maryport to meet on the following day.In Bakewell there is no branch of the Master Builders&apos; Association.  One of the lead-. ing builders&apos;, however, has stated that apprentices are badly wanted, and that it is clearly in the interest of the master builders to come into line with the national scheme.  Pie himself will Jmng forward the question of affiliation to the Midlands Federation.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on page 345.]
