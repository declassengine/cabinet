PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The complete stoppage of work in all the coal mines of Great Britain which took place on the evening of the 31st March has been the outstanding feature of the week. Although the stocks of coal in the country are probably larger, and the demand for coal, owing to the general industrial depression, undoubtedly less, than on the occasion of the coal strike in October last, the present dispute is much more serious for two reasons. Firstly, the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain have refused to allow the pumpmen, and others engaged in keeping the mines in condition, to remain at work ; and secondly, the wide prevalence among trade unionists of the view that the proposed reductions in the miners&apos; wages will, if enforced, be followed by similar reductions in the wages of all other workers, has brought sympathetic action by the railwaymen and transport workers within the realm of probability. As regards the first point, safety workers have already ceased work except in some parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, and the flooding of several pits has already been reported. With regard to the second point, a general conference of the executive committees of the unions affiliated to the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation met in London on the 5th April to consider their policy, and are meeting again on the Gth, when it is expected that a definite decision will be made. It should be noted that this is not an ordinary delegate conference, but a conference of the executives of the affiliated unions, and is, therefore, in a much stronger position with regard to calling a strike. A special general meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen is also being held on the 6th, and it is probable that a joint meeting of the National Union and of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation, as well as a meeting of the Triple Alliance, will also be held on that day. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, how-ever, are holding aloof from the dispute, on the ground that they are not members of the Triple Alliance and have not been consulted in the matter. In view of the gravity of the situation, the first Proclamation of Emergency issued under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, was published on the 31st March, and was followed on the 4th April by an Order in Council under the Act which conferred far-reaching powers upon the various departments of State concerned, to enable them to deal with any emergency that may arise.Mention is made below of an important conference between the Shipbuilding Em-ployers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades held at Carlisle on the 31st March and the 1st April, at&apos;which the employers&apos; proposals for substantial reductions in wages were discussed and rejected by the representatives of the unions concerned. In connection with negotiations of this character, it is interesting to note that the opinion has been expressed in certain quarters that the offer of the coal-owners, in their recent negotiations with the miners, to forgo surplus profits during the experimental period will reverberate in other industries, and that employers generally will be pressed to accept the view that, in attempts to reduce the cost of production, the real wages of labour should be the last to suffer. The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations will meet the National Federation of General Workers at York on the 7th April to continue the negotiations concerning women&apos;s wages in the engineering trades which took place at Manchester on the 17th March. Attention has been called in recent issues of this Report to substantial reductions in the wages of women workers during the past few months, and the view is now being emphasised in trade union quarters that this is a direct result of the lack of organisation amongst women workers. The position of the dispute in the vehicle building industry is brighter, and an early settlement is anti-cipated. Another dispute of some interest which has occurred during the past week is that of the strike of assistant elementary school teachers at Croydon.Details are given below of the annual conference of the National Union of Teachers which opened at Bridlington on the 28th March, and of a conference under the auspices of the National (Administrative Council of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees which
General Situation-continued.began at Sheffield on the 31st March under the chairmanship of Mr. G. R. Campbell, of the Scottish Workers&apos; Committee.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 25th March was 300,019, of which 278,485 were lodged by men and 276 by women totally unemployed, and 21,236 by men and 22 by women working short time. On the 18th March there were 29,112 policies lodged, of which 290,816 were lodged by men and 296 by women totally unemployed, and 22,726 by men and 43 by women working short time.On the 25th March in the United Kingdom 1,888,185 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, of which 680,606 were lodged by males and 401,723 by females totally unemployed, and 350,617 by males and 455,239 by females working short time; an increase on the previous week of 64,844 totally unemployed and a decrease of 4,677 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 25th March was 1,509,600. The above are advance figures provided by the Employment Department, and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 338.FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Building Industry. At a meeting of the South Wales and Monmouthshire District Council of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, the Governments proposals for the absorption of ex-Service men in the industry were discussed. A reso-lution condemning the action of the Government and the employers&apos; federation was carried, and a report was presented showing that considerable numbers of bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters are at present unemployed. Dissatisfaction was also expressed with regard to the alleged action of the employers &quot; in keeping back&quot; the Industrial Councils apprenticeship scheme, and a resolution was passed urging the national executive to press for the adoption of the scheme at an early date. The Scottish National Building Trades Federation (Employers) and the Scottish Building Contractors&apos; Association have accepted the scheme for ex-Service men, and have pledged themselves to support any action which may be deemed necessary to carry it out.Cotton Textile Industry.-D\Q question of short-time working in this industry was again considered* at a meeting of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, held in Manchester on the 1st April. It was decided to continue the system in the American section for another month, and in the Egyptian section for another fortnight, when the question will again be considered. It is reported that, on account of the heavy drain on their funds, the executive council of the Oldham Operative Spinners&apos; Association have instructed the branches that all benefit payments must be reduced to the amounts strictly allowed by rule. This means that the present rates will be reduced by 50 per cent. These proposals were rejected by every branch at the district meetings, but the executive council declare that it is imperative that the reductions should be enforced.Coal Mining Industry. The annual conference of the South Wales Colliery Officials&apos; Union, at Cardiff on the 29th March, unanimously decided to institute a levy of 35. per member per week, to assist in the relief of unemployment.Trade Union Topics.Railway Clerks&apos; Association. At a special conference of this body, held on the 6th March, a resolution embodying a proposal of the executive committee that the rate of subscription for Class A members should be increased from 6d. to Is. per week, and that for Class B (junior) members from 4d. to 6d., was adopted by 72,275 votes to 8,800.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 11, 12th March, 1921, p. 246, and Vol. Ill, No, 14, 2nd April, p. 310. (b 17189T) 2 U 2
Features of the Week-continued.The March issue of the Railway Service Journal, the organ of the association, states that, if any member doubts the necessity for paying the increased subscription, &quot; his doubts will surely be dispelled after reading and reflecting upon &quot; the speeches of chairmen at recent annual meetings of railway shareholders. The journal also remarks that &quot; we should like to assure every suspicious member that the extra Qd. is not wanted for some aggressive or unconstitutional action, but is required to enable the Association to defend the new conditions.&quot;Union of Post Office Workers,^More complete information has now been received concerning the special conference of Irish branches of the Union of Post Office Workers, referred to last week. The following resolutions, in addition to those already reported, were unanimously adopted : (1) That, in the opinion of this conference, a separate union is desirable when the change in the Irish system of government materialises. A definite statement being necessary as to what aid the Union of Post Office Workers is prepared to give for the formation of an Irish union, this conference calls on the Executive Committee to consider the financial aspect of the question, and to bring the issue before the Edinburgh conference as a matter of policy.(2) &apos;&apos; That this conference is of opinion that an Irish National Council subordinate to the Executive Council is essential, and recommends its adoption at the forthcoming annual conference at Edinburgh.(3) &quot; That this conference protests against the arrest of certain members of the Union of Post Office Workers without charge, and calls upon the Postmaster-General to have specific charges made against those members or to secure their release.&quot;A resolution &quot; that this conference of Irish postal workers demand that the principle of self-determination be extended to Ireland,&quot; was proposed but not seconded, the previous question being moved and agreed to.It was stated at the conference, with reference to the rivalry between the Union of Post Office Workers and the Irish Postal Workers&apos; Union, that there were about 14,000 postal workers in Ireland, of whom 5,700 only were members of the Union of Post Office Workers.National Drug and Chemical Union. The question of amalgamation with the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers was discussed at the annual meeting of this union, held in London, on the 28th March. A resolution authorising continuance of the negotiations was carried, but, in the course of the discussion, the need for sectional auto-autonomy in administration was emphasised.Church and Chanel Keepers) Association.-Th.is Association has been absorbed by the National Union of General Workers, having become a branch of that union as from the beginning of this year.*Industrial and other Organisations.Stevedores&apos; Co-operative Society, Ltd. This society has been established by the Amal-gamated Stevedores&apos; Labour Protection League, to carry on the business of contracting for the loading and discharging of merchant vessels. Members of the society are required to take at least five  1 shares. These can be paid for in one sum, or in quarterly instal-ments of 13s., or weekly instalments of Is. Interest will be paid at the rate of 2j per cent, per annum, but may be increased with the sanction of a half-yearly meeting. Of tlie net profits, 2i per cent, will be used to form a reserve fund, after provision has been made for the expenses of management, working materials and gear, and interest on capital, and the remainder will be returned to the members. The members are to elect a management board of seven, together with a president and secretary, and each member of the board will have one vote, irrespective of the number of shares he holds.National Union of Teachers. The annual conference of this union was held at Bridling-ton from the 28th to the 31st March. Mr. G. H. Powell, of Colchester, was elected president for the coming year, and Mr. W. G. Cove, of the Rhondda branch, vice-president. Resolu-tions on various questions were discussed, one of the most important being that protesting &quot; against the suspension, postponement and other methods of delay, which have been adopted in respect of important parts of the Education Act, 1918,&quot; and instructing the Executive Council to carry on a vigorous campaign in opposition to reactionary proposals. Discussion also took place on a motion dealing with the status of teachers. In this resolu-tion, which, was adopted, the conference expressed the opinion that the teaching profession
Features of the Week-continued.should be established on a self-governing basis, and the Executive Council were instructed to prepare and submit a draft scheme for a new constitution for the union, based on the principle of self-government.Another important resolution adopted by the conference instructed the Executive Council &quot; to endeavour to secure from the Burnham Committee through the Teachers&apos; Panel, a provision that Scale IV shall be applied to the country not later than the 1st April, 1923.&quot;Various other resolutions, dealing with the health of the children, the conditions under which they should be taught, and the raising of the age at which they should leave school, were also adopted.National Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committee-A. private conference of unofficial groups of the mining, engineering, transport and other industries, convened by the National Administrative Council of the Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committee movement, opened at Sheffield on the 31st March. The purpose of the conference is, apparently, to link up the unofficial groups in the various industries into a general movement, and also for each industry to meet and formulate an advanced policy applicable to its own conditions. The movement is stated to be industrial only, with the object of establishing an advanced trade union policy, and it is denied that it has any political object.On the first day, the various groups met separately to discuss the policy to be applied within the particular industries, and to formulate reports to be considered by the general conference. The conference passed resolutions congratulating the miners on their refusal &quot; to submit to the starvation wage scale suggested by the employers,&quot; emphasising the fact that the attempt to lower the miners&apos; wages is part of a larger attempt to lower the standard of living of the working classes, and calling upon the workers to resist this attempt by making arrangements to strike in support of the miners at the earliest possible moment.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National). It is understood that the ballot of the building trades operatives on the proposed National Wages and Conditions Council and the regulation of wages by a sliding scale based on the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number, has been completed, but the full returns will not be issued until the end of the week. The general indication seems to point to the fact that the proposals will be accepted both by the master builders and by the men. The first meeting of the Wages and Conditions Council will take place on the 11th April.Shipbuilding (National). The conference between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, which was adjourned at Newcastle on the 10th March,* was resumed at Carlisle on the 31st March. On the 10th March the employers had proposed to terminate the advances granted by the Industrial Court last April on account of the favourable state of the trade, on the ground that the j astification for this advance had ceased to exist. The men&apos;s reply, which was communicated to the employers at the conference on the 1st April, was to the effect that the men could not accept the proposed reduction, and suggested that the matter should be referred to arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act. This the employers refused, pointing out that the arbitration arrangements for the industry were terminated by the trade unions last year.f After the conference, the workmen&apos;s delegates decided to notify the Minister of Labour of the failure of the negotiations and the refusal of arbitration, and to ask the Ministry to intervene.Bakers (Scotland).-Th.e executive of the Scottish Association of Master Bakers have reaffirmed their decision of February last to abandon the principle of a national working agreement, and to advise the areas to endeavour to make local agreements for the ensuing* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 12,19th March, 1921, p. 274.f This refers to the withdrawal of the trade unions, last year from the regular four-monthly review of wages by the Industrial Court and its predecessors.
Negotiations and Disputes continued.year with the various local branches of the operatives&apos; union.  The employers recommend the following as a basis for local negotiations : (1) That the working week be one of 48 hours, instead of 44 as at present.(2) That the wages be automatically adjusted on a sliding scale of 3s. for every alteration of 10 points in the cost-of-living index figures. (3) That there be freedom of action in regard to employment of female labour.On the other hand, the recent decisive vote of the members of the Scottish Operative Bakers&apos; Union respecting the continuance of the principle of a national working agreement has been accepted by the executive of the union as sufficient justification for taking a ballot vote on the question of lodging strike notices with a view to enforcing a renewal of the national agreement.  The result was to be known on the 6th April.Efforts are being made to arrange a meeting of the Industrial Council to consider the matter, but, whereas the union officials are agreeable, the employers&apos; association are, at any rate for the present, opposed to such a meeting.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Coal Miners (National). The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met the President of the Board of Trade on the 30th March, to discuss their proposals for avoiding the dispute, and meeting the present abnormal position of the coal-mining industry. On the ground that these proposals would mean financial assistance for the industry from the Government, Sir Robert Horne stated that the Government could not entertain them.Previous to the meeting with the President of the Board of Trade, the miners&apos; execu-tive had met and resolved &quot; that a communication be sent to districts that all notices must take effect, regardless of occupation, in every mine and plant in the Miners&apos; Federa-tion.&quot; In consequence, therefore, of the abortive character of the conference with Sir Robert Horne, these instructions took effect, with few exceptions, on the night of the 31st March. During the week-end the situation has been discussed at many Labour and other meetings in different parts of the country, which have been followed by the various national conferences referred to on page 328.On the 31st March a Proclamation of Emergency was issued, stating that the situation constitutes a state of emergency within the meaning of the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, and on the 1st April a further proclamation was issued summoning an immediate meeting of the two Houses of Parliament.The Chief Insurance Officer holds the view that the miners have no claim to benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, as the present dispute comes under the category of &quot; trade disputes.&quot; In various parts of the country, however, the miners are claiming benefit, mainly on the grounds that the only offers of employment available in the districts are at a lower rate of wages than those which the workers habitually obtained, &quot;or would have obtained had they continued to be employed,&quot; and that the notices terminating the contracts of employment were given apart from any trade dispute, ^tj Electricians (Scotland). Recent information on this dispute* points to the fact that thelhostility of the Electrical Trades Union towards the proposed wages reduction is becoming less pronounced. This is caused mainly by the fact that a large percentage of the members, some formerly in the employment of members of the contractors&apos; association and others employed in shipyards and engineering shops, and, as such, outside the scope of the present dispute, are, and have been for some time, actually unemployed. The principal reasons which have actuated the Scottish members of the union in declining arbitration appear to be the fear that the negotiations between the English branches and the National Federated Electrical Association will be prejudiced, and the prospective reductions of wages in the shipbuilding and engineering industries, where already the rates are less than those which would prevail, were the contractors&apos; association^ proposals agreed to.Waterproof Garment Workers (Manchester).-Ahoxit 3,000 employees, members of the Waterproof Garment Workers&apos; Union, ceased work on the 29th March, as a result of the proposals of the Indiarubber Manufacturers&apos; Association to reduce wages by 17-J percent, as from the first full pay-clay after the 28th March.Settlements and Agreements.General Labourers, Navvies, and Others. In accordance with the agreement arrived at by the conciliation board, composed of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors* The firms involved in this dispute are.those organised by the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland. See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 12, 19th March, p. 274.
Negotiations and Disputes-continued.of Great Britain and the unions concerned, which include the National Amalgamated Union of Labour and the National Union of General Workers, contractors affiliated to the Federa-tion have brought into operation during the week a wages reduction from 2s. Id. to Is. lOd. per hour, and the working hours have been increased to 49J. The men mainly affected are navvies, excavators and labourers. The members of the unions have generally accepted the situation. At South Shields, however, 70 men have refused to accept the reduction owing to a local misunderstanding.Steel Wothers [South Wales). It is understood that a satisfactory solution has been found of the differences between the South Wales Siemens&apos; Steel Association and the various craft unions organising maintenance men. The craftsmen, with the exception of the builders and engineers, have now accepted the sliding scale already in operation for process workers. The engineers have decided to accept a modified offer of the employers of  5 per week, coupled with a promise that in the future they will be paid the district engineering rate.   The builders have not yet decided on any course of action.Fishermen (Various Districts). In the hope of meeting the crisis in the fishing industry, the Hull Fishing Vessels Association, Ltd., have forwarded their co-partnership and profit-sharing scheme to the trade unions concerned, namely, the Hull Seamen&apos;s Union, the National Union of British Fishermen, the Humber Amalgamated Steam Trawlers, Engineers and Firemen&apos;s Union, and the National Sailors and Firemen&apos;s Union. The new rates came into operation on the 2nd April, and it seems clear that the unions have realised that, if the industry is to be kept going, there is no alternative but to accept the owners&apos; terms for the present. The owners are of opinion that there will be no trouble so far as Hull and Grimsby are concerned, and the engineers&apos; union have already accepted the revised rates. At Scarborough, however, ,the men are resisting a similar claim by the owners, following the attitude of the fishermen at Aberdeen and Hartlepool.Co-operative Employees (Scotland: Various Districts). The Dumfries and Maxwelltowh Co-operative Society, Ltd., is now added to the list of societies given in this Report last-week, who are showing reluctance to apply the terms of Sheriff Fyfe&apos;s award. *With reference to the wages difference existing between the Northern Co-operative Society, Ltd., Aberdeen, and their employees, a ballot vote of the members of the society has resulted in an overwhelming majority against any further concessions to the employees concerned. A conference has been unsuccessful in effecting a settlement, and a ballot vote of the employees on the question of withdrawal of labour is in contemplation.[Oilier disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departments Section of the Report, pages 334 to 336.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Boilermakers: Protest against Wages Aivard. The Amalgamated Union of Shipbuilding, Engineering and Constructional Workers have appealed to the department against Industrial Court Award No. 615, which dealt with the rate for oil-tight work on the Clyde.* The society have been informed that when two parties have agreed to have recourse to arbitration they are morally bound to accept the decision of the arbitration tribunal, and that the request for a rehearing of the case by a new court cannot be complied with.WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING.Vehicle Builders (National).-A further conference! was held in Leeds on the 1st April. The Chief Conciliation Officer presided. There were present representatives, on the one side, of the United Kingdom Joint Wages Board of Employers, representing the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders, the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association and the Wales and Monmouthshire Association; and, on the other, of the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Wheelwrights, Smiths and Kindred Trades Union, and the Amalgamated Society of Wood Cutting Machinists. The following agreement was arrived at: &quot; 1. That there shall be a reduction in wages of 2d. per hour on all minimum rates, to operate on the first full pay after the date of this agreement.&quot; 2. That a sliding scale be adopted as from the first day of May, 1921, based on the cost of living as shown by the Board of Trade returns in the Labour Gazette, the first reduction to take effect as from the first of June, based on the figures for April, at the rate of \d. for the first ten points below the present index figure of 141, and afterwards at the rate of hi. for every 6  points below 131, the second revision to take place on the 1st August based on the figure for June ; the rates to be reviewed every three months after the 1st August, 1921, based on the figures for September and December, as appearing in the Gazelle, and the new rates to operate from the 1st November and the 1st February, respectively.&quot; 3. In the event of the index figure for any period being an increase over that of the preceding *        period there shall be a corresponding increase in the rate of wages, circulated on the same basis as pertains in the case of a decrease. &quot;&quot; 4. These proposals shall form a national settlement.&quot; 5. Any dispute arising as to the interpretation of this agreement shall be referred to a joint wages board of employers and employees for settlement.&quot; 6. This agreement shall remain in force until the 1st May, 1922, and any proposed amendment or alteration shall be subject to two months&apos; notice, to be given prior to that date.&quot;The following supplementary agreement relating to Scottish standard rates was also reached: &quot;1. It is hereby agreed that there shall be a reduction of 2\d. per hour on all standard rates for skilled tradesmen, including coach vicemen, to operate on the first full pay after the date of this agreement.&quot;2. The sliding scale to operate concurrently with the national minimum wage rate agreement, except in the case of men employed on coach work, whose rate shall be reduced an extra farthing on the 1st June, 1921, and the 1st February, 1922.&quot; 3. All other clauses of the agreement dated the 13th November, 1920, to remain in operation subject to alteration to suit the requirements of the revised wage rates.&quot;The terms of the agreement will be submitted to a ballot vote of the unions concerned; but, in view of the fact that the signed agreement will be circulated with the ballot papers, it is anticipated that they will be accepted, and that work will be resumed towards the end of the week.* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 8, 12th February, p. 180. t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 14, 2nd April, p. 314.
QUARRYING.Cement. The rules for working conditions in the cement manufacturing industry have been codified and signed by the members of the Industrial Council. Except in cases of dismissal for misconduct, workers are to be given a week&apos;s notice, or a week&apos;s wages in lieu thereof. One week&apos;s holiday, with pay, in addition to national holidays, will be granted to workers who have been in the service for one year, and have not lost more than seven days during that period.Clay. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, on the 31st March, con-sidered a proposal of the employers to reduce wages for adult male workers by 10s. per week. It was agreed to extend the current agreement from the 13th April to the 30th April, to allow the trade unions time to consult their executives and members. The Committee will meet again on the 22nd April.TRANSPORT.Carters (London). In December last an advance of 4s. per week was given by agree-ment to carters employed in the road transport industry in the London area by members of the London Cartage and Haulage Contractors&apos; Association and the Motor Transport Employers&apos; Federation. At a joint meeting with the unions concerned, on the 31st January, the employers gave notice that the advance would be withdrawn. A number of abortive conferences followed, but negotiations were broken off. The employers requested the department to refer the difference to arbitration. Representatives of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation were interviewed on the 1st April, and the employers were invited to discuss the matter on the 4th April.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Pottery Workers (Scotland). Mr. J. Macdonald, who was appointed as single arbitrator in a dispute* between the National Pottery Workers&apos; Society and the Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., decided that the war bonus should be reduced by 2d. per hour, in the case of men, and Id. per hour in the case of women and boys, making the current war bonus 4l,d., 3JcZ. and 2\d. per hour for men, women and boys, respectively.CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Chemicals. The Joint Industrial Council met on the 30th March, to consider the employers&apos; demand for a reduction in wages. The original proposal had been for a sliding scale, but, at the meeting on the 22nd March, a proposal was substituted that there should be a minimum reduction of 2d. per hour ; that, on the 1st June, all wages should be reduced to a maximum of Is. 5d. for labourers and Is. Id. for shift men, and that these rates should be subject to review in July. This proposal was to come into effect on the first pay-day after the 1st April. The workers&apos; representatives refused, and asked for arbitration. After separate meetings of each side with the Principal Assistant Secretary, it was agreed that the proposal should be modified to the extent that it should come into effect on the third pay-day after the 1st April, in order that the workers&apos; representatives might report it to the members of their unions.TEXTILES.Bleachers and Dyers (Scotland). The difference in the Scottish dyeing industry respecting a proposed reduction of wages, which was privately referred by the parties to the arbitration of Sir Thomas Munro, C.B.E., has now been brought under the Industrial Courts Act, the parties having agreed that Sir Thomas should be appointed formally by the department.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).  The Provincial Council for North Wales met on the 22nd March. Letters from a number of local authorities were received stating that they had decided to secede from the Council. It was unanimously decided, after both sides had expressed their regret at the necessity, that the Provincial Council be dissolved.(b 17189 t)Industrial Relations Department-continued.
Industrial Relations Department-continued.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Shop Assistants (London). In connection with the dispute between the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and the 13 London stores represented by the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors, the Principal Assistant Secretary recently interviewed the secretary of the association, and the chairman of their Labour Committee. The firms have not accepted arbitration under the Industrial Courts Act, and no joint machinery for settlement exists. The union are urging that a Court of Inquiry should be set up.The association^ representatives contended that wages conditions not less favourable than the terms of the Army and Navy Stores award were being observed. Arbitration proceedings were refused on the ground that the union did not represent a substantial proportion of the employees. They urged that no difference exists or is apprehended warranting a Court of Inquiry. When the union could prove proper representation, the association would be prepared to reconsider their attitude as to recognition. The asso-ciation had accepted Trade Board machinery for the regulation of wages; and in certain stores &quot; staff councilswere in existence. Though the firms did not negotiate with these councils on hours and wages, they were prepared to receive suggestions from them.It was agreed that the department should put before the union the associations position with regard to wages and recognition, and that the Minister&apos;s decision regarding a Court of Inquiry should be communicated later.Needle, Fish-Hook, Fishing Tackle and Allied Trades. The Wages Committee of the Joint Industrial Council met on the 22nd March to consider a letter from the employers&apos; association with reference to a reduction in wages. The meeting&apos; was adjourned for three weeks to give the workpeople an opportunity to submit counter-proposals.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Entertainments. The Industrial Council met on the 18th March. The question of the Council affiliating to the Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees was referred to the executive committee. Affiliation was opposed by some members on the ground that the industry could not involve itself in the affairs of other industries, and by others on the ground that the Council could not commit themselves to any proposal for making the agreements of a Joint Industrial Council binding on a whole industry.The Employment of Theatrical Performers Bill, 1921, which is aimed at the bogus manager, was criticised by the employers&apos; side as unwieldy, and the Council appointed a committee to draft a Bill which would adequately safeguard the profession. It was decided to ask the department to arrange for a deputation to be received by the Railway Rates Advisory Committee, as high rates were considered an important cause of unemploy-ment in the industry.A letter from the department was read, suggesting that the dispute between the Rochdale and District Amusement Managers&apos; Association and the National Association of Theatrical Employees might be suitable for reference to the Conciliation Board of the Council. The Provincial Entertainments Proprietors and Managers&apos; Association, of which, it was stated, the Rochdale managers are members, and the National Association of Theatrical Employees, accepted this suggestion, and the secretary was instructed to communicate with the parties. An officer of the Employment Department consulted the Council on the question of admitting into the country a &quot; jazz band &apos;&quot; of negro musicians, the main point being whether an equivalent could not be supplied from musicians in this country. The employees&apos; side were unanimously opposed to their admission; the employers&apos; side refused to commit themselves to any opinion, although it might be inferred that they were iavourable to admission.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will he found also on&apos;pages 326 to 333, 337 and 338.]

Owing to the Easter holidays there is a pronounced lull in industrial activity, and most districts report prolonged stoppages, in many cases extending to 10 days. The main alterations in the situation during the week are noted below.Iron and Steel. Eeports from Scotland indicate that the position has grown slightly worse. At Airdrie a firm employing about 870 men are closing down indefinitely, and at Motherwell the number of men paid off continues to grow week by week. The position in the Northern Division is very unsettled. Consett report that the whole works of the Consett Iron Co., Ltd., except the blast furnace department, will probably close down for a fortnight. At Hartlepool, 250 men are affected by the closing down of mills belonging to the South Durham Steel and Iron Co., Ltd. On the other hand, there is a slight improve-ment in iron ore mining, and South Bank report that the plate mills of Messrs. Bolckow, Vaughan &amp; Co., Ltd., employing some hundreds, of men, are likely to resume on the 4th April. At Scunthorpe the only steel works still working are blowing out their furnaces and closing down their rolling mills, which will displace 1,000 men. In the Barrow-in-Furness district, all the iron ore mines and the Barrow steel works are closed for an indefinite period.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.At Dowlais employment at the local steel works lias been good during the week. In the Northampton area practically all ironstone mines have ceased work, except at Brix-worth, where work is restricted to one day per week.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries.-On the Clyde, the discharge of shipyard iron workers continues as a result of the joiners&apos; strike. Work in the repairing yards at Newport (Mon.) has increased during the week.Textiles and Clothing. There is reason to believe that the depression hi the cotton trade has almost reached its lowest point. It is stated that the output of the looms is not more than 25 per cent, of their full capacity, and it is believed that the prolonged cut in output is bound to create a favourable reaction before very long. More activity has been noticeable in the lace trade, but this is regarded as merely due to a temporary holiday rush.In the boot and shoe trade the prospects after Easter are considered to be brighter, as at Northampton inquiries are now being made for a Cossack type of boot which, it is anticipated, will result in substantial orders. The position is also improving at Stafford ; the largest firm in the district anticipate going on full time after the holidays.Miscellaneous Trades.-h\ the cycle and motor trades slight improvements are reported from Coventry, where three firms have resumed working five days a week, and from Nottingham,where a number of men have resumed full-time working.With regard to the fishing industry, the position at Wick is not expected to improve until the opening of the West Coast fishing in May. Prospects at Stomaway are regarded as unfavourable. At Fleetwood a larger number of trawlers arrived for the Easter fish trade, but many are still tied up. At Milford Haven, as the terms of the trawler owners have not been accepted, the whole of the fleet of trawlers have been docked.A curtailment of activity in the cement trade is reported from Gravesend due to a declining export trade and foreign competition. In the Metropolitan area, the demand for carpenters has fallen off considerably.Transport. On the Mersey, export and import cargoes are reported to be very small, and work which normally falls to casual dockers is being given to permanent employees. At Hull-there is an average daily surplus of labour at the docks of about 4,000 men. In South Wales there is much unemployment among dockers and members of the mercantile marine.Labour Reductions. At Bristol 100 men have been discharged from the cocoa works of Messrs. J. S. Fry &amp; Sons. Discharges are again taking place at the rate of 50 per week from the dockyards at Devonport and Portsmouth, in accordance with the reductions foreshadowed in the Naval Estimates. Oban report the discharge of 400 men by the British Aluminium Co., Ltd., Kinlochleven.womens Employment.General Situation. Reports continue to show a serious state of unemployment and under-employment. Throughout the divisions efforts are being made to persuade suitable women to undertake seasonal domestic employment, in which there is now a good demand for labour. The Women&apos;s Sub-Committees of Local Employment Committees are taking part in this work, and in many cases are interviewing suitable applicants. There are a few indications that applicants are showing more willingness to consider vacancies for resident domestic work, but many of the women registered are untrained and inexperi-experienced, and others, owing to their domestic ties, cannot undertake resident work.The main alterations in the situation during the week are noted below.Local Reports. Extended holidays are taking place in all the textile centres, and depressing reports are received from the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division. At Todmorden practically the whole of the mills and factories in the district, including two large firms of wholesale clothiers, are closed down for periods varying from 10 days to 3 weeks. Half of the women and girl workers in this town are said to be wholly unemployed or on extended holidays. The prospects for the future are considered gloomy. In Notting-ham, depression is now being felt in the tobacco, cigarette, and cigar factories. Marked attention is being given to the development of seasonal and domestic work at the Exchange.Leicester state that the improvement in the hosiery and boot trades is slight but maintained. The total number of women&apos;s claims for insurance benefit current in this town is over 6,000. It is becoming exceedingly difficult to place married women, as the majority of the firms stipulate for single women only.
Employment and Insurance Department-continued.Short time is increasing in the pottery industry of the West Midland Division, and extended holidays are general throughout the division.The Leyton Exchange report that, although unemployment prevails in the majority of the local industries, such as furnishing, upholstery, paper and printing, brush making, boot making, food manufacture, and the clothing trades, the aspect is nevertheless becoming brighter. In Scotland the depression in the textile, linen, jute and hosiery industries continues. Aberdeen report a live register of over 1,600, and many short-time workers. Dundee state that the depression in the jute industry is developing, and there is an increase of over 600 on the live register. In the linen industry in Dunfermline, and in the woollen and hosiery manufacture in Galashiels, unemployment is also increasing. Throughout the division attention is being given to arrangements in connection with the supply of workers to seasonal resorts.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment Insurance. Burnley suggest that, in cases where employers refuse, or neglect, to verify statements as to employment, committees should have discretionary powers to authorise payment of benefit. St. Helens suggest that all married women claiming under Section 3 of the new Act be summoned before the E-ota Sub-Committee, notwithstanding the fact that the applicants furnish proof of employment in insurable work in at least 20 weeks since the 31st December, 1919. The Hebden Bridge and Middleton Committees have called attention to hard cases where cx-Service men are unable to qualify for benefit, and suggest that more discretion should be given to the committees.Women&apos;s Work. The Erith Women&apos;s Sub-Committee request the Minister to take all steps possible to ensure that a certain amount of the money allocated to Lord St. David&apos;s Fund should be used for the training of women.JUVENILE BRANCH.Hollow-ware Trade (West Midlands). Inquiries have recently been made by various exchanges in the West Midlands Division into the conditions of juvenile employment in this trade. The reports indicate a lack of any definite system of apprenticeship ; but it is stated that boys, as a rule, obtain sufficient training to fit them for skilled work at the age of 18. Of a total of nearly 500 boys and 600 girls engaged in the trade only six were definitely regarded as learners. The prospects of permanent employment are stated to be good, but, at Stourbridge, owing to the present trade depression, it will not be possible to absorb the numbers at present employed. The general conditions of the trade are not considered to be unhealthy, except in one or two processes, where there is some danger of lead poisoning. Owing to the precautions taken, however, this danger is reduced to a minimum. It is suggested that the introduction of a definite method of progressive training would greatly improve the prospects of young workers in the trade.Unemployed Juveniles (Newport). At Newport it has not been found possible to arrange for a centre for unemployed juveniles. Provision is being made, however, for a number of sea-going boys to attend classes in navigation at the Technical Institute, while waiting for a berth.Apprenticeship (Swindon). The Juvenile Advisory Committee have considered the question of apprenticeship. In June last, a general scheme was formulated and circulated to all local trade organisations for their observations. The scheme, as now adopted by the Committee, provides for an indentured apprenticeship of 5 years, including a probationary period of six months, commencing at the age of 16. A scale of wages, ranging from one-fifth of the full adult rate in the first year to two-thirds in the fifth year, is suggested, but it is provided that this scale may be varied in cases where there is a special trade agreement regarding the rates to be paid to boys. Provision is also made for attendance at technical classes, and a week&apos;s holiday per annum.*[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department loill also be found on pages 329, 332 and 342.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics-During the week ending the 24th March the department placed 312 candi-(lates, bringing the total number known to have been placed to 52,562. Applications were registered from 559 ex-Service men and 23 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 24th March was 10,52] ex-Service men and 1,226 civilians. At the same date .934 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 340 having been registered during-the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 24th March, the department received 74 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number to 3,000, of which 840 have since been cancelled. Giants have been sanctioned in 653 cases. At the same date, 332 training vacancies were available, 60 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Depart-ment have dealt with 1,138 cases, in 489 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry have completed training in 310 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 116 are in training and 17 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and other Ex-Service Men.Statistics.-On the 29th March, 24,477 men were in training, as against 24,766 on the 22nd March, and 24,822 on the 1st March. During the week, 205 men were placed in train-ing. There were 16,428 men aAvaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 22nd March and the 1st March being 16,482 and 16,160. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 28,953, the totals for the 22nd March and the 1st March being 28,459 and 27,220.Extension of Institutional Tmining. The authority given to Divisional Directors to grant extensions, after the normal institutional period, to men unable, owing to trade depression, to find improvership vacancies was to have expired on the 31st March. Authority, however, has been received from the Treasury to allow such further limited extensions as will minimise hardship, and obviate placing a number of men simultaneoasly on the labour market at a time of exceptional unemployment. The termination of these extensions will be spread over April, May and Jane. Men will be discharged at different dates within this period, in accordance with the length of the extensions already granted, those who have been retained the longest being tlie first to leave. This will secure that, by the 30th June, the emergency powers granted should cease, and that the normal pro-cedure for prolonging training in special circumstances beyond the prescribed period should be resumed.Elementary Teachers. The scheme for a training college for manual instructors at the King Albert Hospital, Hornsey, to accommodate 180 men, has received Treasury sanction. A hostel, to accommodate about half the number, will be provided, together with a canteen for non-residents. The premises and the scheme generally have been approved by the Board of Education, who are prepared to make the usual grants for the training of teachers.Exhibitions. At the International Building Trades Exhibition at Olympia, which opens on the 12th April, the department will have working exhibits in carpentry and joinery, bricklaying, masonry, plastering, plumbing, painting and general building draughts-manship. The exhibition is essentially of a technical character, and it is expected that a large number of trade experts and employers will attend.
Appointments and Training-continued.Government Instructional Factories. On the 17th March, the Kirkdale Factory, Liverpool, where there are now some 200 men in training, was honoured by a visit from H.M. the Queen and H.R.H. Princess Mary, who, accompanied by the Lord Mayor, made a tour of all the departments. They appeared to be specially interested in the inlaid and decorative work of the cabinet-making section. Her Majesty expressed her complete satisfaction with the general arrangements of the factory and the work in progress.Women&apos;s Training.Unemployed Women-The training of registered unemployed women under the Ministry&apos;s scheme ceased on the 31st March. In all, 7,174 women have been trained, of whom 5,100 entered industrial occupations and 2,064 took up various forms of domestic work. Owing to the spread of unemployment among industrial workers, training has, with the exception of one clerical course, been given in domestic -and allied subjects only since the 30th June, 1920.War Widows. Three fresh schemes for the training of war widows in home dress-making have been sanctioned during the month. The number of outstanding cases has been reduced to 365, the panel having sanctioned training in 67 cases during the month. There are 689 widows at present in training.Disabled Nurses. Sixteen fresh applications have been received during the month. Financial sanction was given in four cases, for training in poultry farming, artistic work, cookery and housekeeping.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 30th March agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 46,019 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,945 apprentices employed by 17,487 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agree-ment between the parties, is now 21,825.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. Difficulty has been experienced by the War Office in obtaining skilled carpenters, bricklayers, and plasterers for the construction of married quarters in a number of camps between Weymouth and Bournemouth. The District Officers of the Royal Engineers, having employed three apprentices under the scheme with success, are recommending the adoption of the scheme on a large scale.. Local headquarters are furnishing a detailed list of apprentices eligible. The work offers satisfactory facilities for training.The Ministry of Health having expressed the view that the placing of the Corporation housing contracts in Aberdeen is a question for the Town Council to decide for themselves,* the whole of the plumbing work will be divided between one master plumber, wrho has apprentices under the scheme, and the borough workshops.Institutional Training. In the London and South-Eastern area, difficulty is being experienced in providing institutional training for engineering apprentices, owing to lack of facilities. A special course for engineering apprentices on short time has been started at the Central School of Science and Technology, Stoke-on-Trent, and endeavours are being made to provide for apprentices in a like position, at the Suffolk Street Technical Schools, Birmingham. Many additional applications have been received for admission to the second whole-time class at Aberdeen, where 33 apprentices are already in attendance. Negotiations are proceeding for a special whole-time class for apprentice plumbers at the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division, of the seven towns with a population of over 100,000 opposition to the national apprenticeship scheme has been encountered only in Sheffield. In Leeds, Bradford, Nottingham, Hull and Halifax, the scheme is now in the hands of the various organisations to establish committees. Committees are being formed in Dewsbury, Derby, York, Harrogate, Doncaster, Keighley and Grimsby.  In the smaller towns the scheme is being well received.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 329 and 340.]
