IS DOCUi-tFlrT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN IG I Ajk-^S GOV* * ItffTdT).CR&apos;T.CABINET.&apos;P.2C45\fclcmcrandum circulated &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchoouor*I attcmnt in thin paner to reduce to v; riting tho considerations, which I have already placed before you orally, suggested by r. study of the problems which aro at the moment preoccupying the Reparation Commission.     In certain particu-lars, more especially in treating of the technical Treaty position on the 1st May, I am compelled to record my own impressions, since this aspect of the matter uas not fully discussed by me with Sir John Bradbury before my departure. I should therefore not like it to be assumed that ho would corroborate exactly the views stated.     It will be convenient to divide this memorandum into two parts - tho first treating of the general position, and the second of the outlook as regards the total of her indebtedness which Is to bo notified to Germany not later than the first proximo.Under Article 235 of tho Treaty of Versailles Germany is obliged to pay in such, instalments and in such manner as tho Reparation Commission may fix, the equivalent of 20 milliards gold marks by the 1st Kay,     Germany claims to have paid by far the larger part of this sum;   she did claim that she had paid more than the full sum but has now receded from that po-sition.    The Reparation Commission estimates that Germany has paid not more than S milliards.    When the London Conference took place, the main justification of the Allies for imposing sanctions on Germany was understood to be the substantial default of Germany under tho above Article.    No technicaldefault at that time existed. The Reparation Commission had never fixed Instalments for the 20 milliards and had not /
not formally reported Germany for default. Shortly after the London Conference and the decision to impose sanctions, the Reparation Commission made a demand upon Germany for the payment of 1 milliard of gold marks within a week and of the remainder of the outstanding balance under Article 235 before the 1st May. The German Government refused, pleading inability to pay even the 1 milliard, and the Reparation Commission, having created the technical default, reported it to the Allied Governments. So far, therefore, as concerns the straightforward fulfilment of Article 235, which is in its essence a Clause the force of which lapses on the 1st proxime, the question has been transferred by the Reparation Commission from their own hands to these of the Allied Governments. The Allied Governments at the London Conference had themselves dealt with the default before it arose technically.

If the above presentation of facts is correct, it will be realised that the press campaign which is being carried on in France, investing the 1st May with a portontous significance, rests on a misconception. The implicit reasoning involved is that Germany has been guilty of a new default in refusing the demands of the Reparation Commission, but that this default does not become final and fully punishable until the lst May, on which date therefore, if the unpaid balance of 12 milliards is not liquidated, it will be necessary and proper to proceed further punitive measures, of which the forcible occupation of the Ruhr seems to be easily the most favoured.

There is, however, another and an indirect method by which further defaults might be created by the French almost at will. It is the duty of the Reparation Commission on the 1st May not only to fix a total, but to fix the instalments by which this total indebtedness shall be liquidated in accordance with the terms of the Treaty over a period of 3?
years. The Reparation Commission as a body has not addressed its mind to this latter aspect of the problem. Sir John Bradbury&apos;s view of the way in which it should be approached is as follows.

For the first five or eight years the course which most plainly suggests itself is to impose upon Germany payments of the same order and magnitude as were envisaged in the Paris Agreement. For the rest of the period he would fix annuities, comprising both interest and principle, increasing as evenly as possible over the whole period, and serving at the end of the further 22 years to have liquidated the total of the indebtedness notified on the 1st May.

The natural course would be for the Reparation Commission to fix half-yearly dates of payment. If this course were adopted, it might safely be assumed that no now default could arise until the 1st November next. There is, however, enough to indicate that the French will not so readily renounce the unfulfilled benefit of early substantial payments which is accorded to them by Article 235 and which would normally lapse on the 1st May.

It may, therefore, be conjuctured that the French delegate will press the Commission in fixing instalments to impose for the first year a figure which will amount to a normal instalment plus the 12 milliards not paid under Article 235 or, at the minimum, to the 12 milliards itself. Should this policy be adopted, it is obvious that the old default can be continually re-created.

II.

The position as regards the finding of the total may be roughly summarised as follows. The figures which I use make no pretence to exactness as they are arrived at by
various conversions which could not be assumed to bo nocessa-rily final.The total claims a? submitted to the German Government Uiuountccl to approximately&apos; ^13 milliard gold marks.    This &apos; figure, however, included a substantial claim by Czecho Slovakia which has now been rejected by tho Reparation Coim-Is3ion itself, and various either rejections have been made which, would reduce the total claims to about 200 milliards.The views of the German Delegation have been hoard in al-most continuous sittings for the last three weeks both on questions of principle and on questions of detail.&apos;&apos;  Their oral criticisms, which were moderately expressed, have been re-inforccd by copious memoranda.    Written and oral criticisms from tho nature of tho case cannot have exhausted the subject in&apos;viow of the shortness of time available, aid for tho same reason cannot receive exhaustive judicial consideration at the hands of tho Commission.    At tho present minute the Commission is engaged upon tho examination of these claims in the light of tho German criticisms in an attempt to arrive at a total by talcing sviccossivo cntcgorios of damage for separate countries. Sir John Bradbury has always strongly hold the view that the Commission must concentrate upon the finding of a total without much regard to tho items tihioh compose it, and-in particular without attempting to find separate totals for the various claimants.     The logic of events will be almost certainly sufficient to impose this procedure upon the Commission;   apart from tho difficulty of arriving at a total by any ether means, the Spa Agreement regarding distribution of reparation receipts might be called,, into question if any serious attempt wore made to award on the basis of individual claims.In attempting to forecast tho result which will bo arrived at, it is well not to start with the above figure of 200 milliards, which includes fantastic claims by the smaller Powers unsupported by any evidence.    A Court ef Lav; would have to rule them out;the/     - ;, -4-
tho Commission, proceeding on a more equitable b&amp;3is, might reasonable arrive at tho proper figure for the smaller Powers by tho statistical method of taxing a proportion of theproved claims of Jr-nce, Groat Britain, Italy and Belgium. In arriving at the Spa percentages, it was assumed that 92$ of tho fiac&amp;ge was suffered by these four con tries. The damage caused to the smaller Powers night thoreiore be assumed to be e/Sftn^U of the damage suffered by tho four big PowerOtThe claims of the four, after ruling out certain items which are agreed to be invalid and certain others which could only be sustained by a unanimous interpretation which will not be forthcoming of doubtful passages in the treaty, amount roughly to 169 milliards   This total may be divided into 79 milliards for pensions end separation allowances, and 90 milliards for damages to property, damage to persons and miscellaneous claims.     It Id not to bo expected that the 79 milliards for pen ions and separation allowances willl be very substantially decreased.   The Italian claim on t.ece heads is patently exaggerated0   It amounts to almost one-half oi the Irenoh claim, though 11 iy entered the War nearly 3. months later,,   In the view of Sir John Bradbury3 the Trench claim, which rests entirely on a statistical basis&amp; is probably exaggerated by 10$ and this error has probably infected the other claims to tho extent of 5$0   But on paper tho : ritiuh claim is probably the most startling and is at tho same timo the most invulnerable*   It has substantially been aoceptod by our lllios and on this ground alone, it would not be safe to look for a substantial reduction on tho others *As
As regards the damage to property and persons, the German criticisms if accepted absolutely would probably lead to a reduction of something like 7?%. Eliminating the criticisms which are clearly not admissible, a reduction of 50% would probably be justified, but there is no reason to suppose that a majority of the delegates would support so drastic a reduction. The utmost that would appear to be possible would be a reduction of 25% all round which would reduce the property and persons claims to 07, which, when added to the 79 for pensions and separation allowances, gives a total of approximately 146 milliards for the total damage of the four Powers, which again, on addition of 8/92nds. for the other claimants, gives a total claim against Germany of 159 milliard gold marks.

It is, however, more than doubtful whether it will be possible to obtain the necessary majority for such a total, which even so would in the view of the British Delegate at least be unjustifiably high. The policy of the French Delegate would appear to be influenced by the desire of the French Government to reach a high total. He may reject so drastic a curtailment of the claims of the smaller Powers, and he will probably reject a 2?% reduction of the claims for property and persons. It is possible that the Italian Delegate, whose policy is obscure, will lend his support. The position is such that with only four votes on the Commission as at present constituted the French Chairman with one supporter can always make his view prevail by means of his casting vote.

The Belgium Government appear to be anxious that the Commission should find it possible to arrive at a total of between 130 and 150 milliard gold marks. It is just possible, therefore, that Sir John Bradbury&apos;s final
conclusion may nearly coincide with that of his Belgian colleague, in which case the Italian Delegate might support the moderate figure.

When I left Paris, the actual work of trying to reach final figures was only beginning, and it is this process only which can more clearly disclose the probable course of events. I therefore only venture to make the above statements subject to the understanding that what is happening in Paris may already have rendered them out of date.

I attach a copy of a memorandum dictated by Sir John Bradbury on Saturday afternoon, which gives his present impression of the repercussion upon the percentages of the consideration of claims.

(Signed) A. McFADYEAN.
The total claims of France, Great Britain, Italy and Belgium, as they at present stand, taken together amount to 169 milliards of gold marks on the basis of the most probable rates of conversion. Of this total, 79.21 milliards represents pensions and separation allowances, and 89.79 property claims, including maritime losses, damage to civil persons, etc. The claims of the smaller Powers are at present in a state of inextricable confusion, and it is quite impossible to prophesy what amount will ultimately be allowed. For the purposes of the present calculations, it is assumed that the amounts allowed in respect of the smaller Powers will be in the proportion to the claims of the larger Powers of 8 to 92, the Spa Agreement percentages. This would make the total claims 184 milliards, of which 86 milliards would be pensions and separation allowances, and 98 milliards property, etc., claims.

Very small reductions, if any, are capable of being made in the French, British, or Belgian separation allowance claims. The Italian pension and separation allowance claims, which are more than 50 per cent. of the French, and about 70 per cent. of the British, are probably overstated by 5 or 6 milliards, but it is doubtful whether it will be possible to run the overstatements to earth.

Apart from this, any reductions which are made would have to be confined to the property, etc., claims, which, in the case of all countries are grossly over-estimated - possibly on an average by as much as 50 per cent. A 50 per cent. reduction of the property claims would reduce the total of 184 milliards to 135 milliards, while a 25 per cent. reduction in these claims would reduce the total to 159 milliards.

It is very unlikely that a majority of the Commission would be prepared for even as much a reduction as 25 per cent.
\. 188It is also not unlikely that some members of tho Commission may press for conversion rates into gold marks more favourable to tho claimant Powers than those which have been taken for the purposes of the above calculations.As regards percentages, the French claim, as it at presont stands, is 8G.7 milliards of gold marks, or about 47 per cent of the total, as comoared with 52 per cent assigned to Prance by tho Spa Agreement.The British claim is 42.4 milliards, or about 23 per cent, as compared with 22,The Italian claim is 25,9 milliards, or about 14 per cent, as compared with 10,The Belgian claim Is 14.5 milliards - almost exactly the 0 per cent contemplated,An equal percentage reduction of all property claims would re-duce tho all round percentage in tho case of Franco and Belgium, whose property claim to the total is comparatively high   and increase it in the case of Great Britain and Italy, where the percentage of property claims is comparatively low.    The only danger of a reduc-tion of the ratio of the British claim to the French below tho Spa ratio would be in the case of a substantial reduction of the maritime losses claim without a compensating reduction in tho French property claim.    Having regard to the stage already reached in the considera-tion of tho maritime claims and the fact that the French property claims are probably at least as vulnerable as the British maritime claims, this danger can be regarded as remote.On the other hand, on the above figures Italy would appear tohave a case for rc-opening the percentage questions as against both France and Great Britain.    The Italian figure is, however, based onthe very questionable majority decision of the Reparation Commissionin regard to the date of commencement of the s tate of War between italy and Germany, and the Italian Delegate has given it.to be under-stood that the Italian Government regards itself as definitely bound by the percentage agreement and will not use this decision as an excuse for re-opening the question,^     (Sd)  ,JOHN BRADBURY.
