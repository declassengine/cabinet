^THIS IXXJOICTT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS HRELMNNIC KAJESTY!S GOTOMOT?)SFCRFT ,CABINET.CP.2861.ESTIMATES COJ&amp;committee.Note by the Lord Privy Seal,In accordance with the promise which I made in theHouse of Commons on the 25th February last during the debate on the Office of Vorks Supplementary Estimate I invited a fewMembers of the House to,it with me on an informal Committeeto assist mo in considering whether an Estimates Committeeshould be appointed and, if so, what form it should take.The following were the Members whom I invited to serve :-The Rt. Hon. J.H. Tfhitley, M.P,,The Rt. Hon, Sir Donald Maclean, K.B.E., M.P,,The Rt. Hon, J.R, Clynes, M.P.,The Rt, Hon. A, Henderson, M.P.,Lieutenant Commander E. Hilton Young, M.P.,The Rt, Hon. George Lambert, M.P.,The Rt. Hon. Sir Frederick Banbury Bart, M.P.,The Rt. Hon. J.T7. Wilson, M.P.The Committee has now completed its enquiry and I circu-late for the consideration of the Cabinet the conclusions at which we arrived.    The recommendations i\ere agreed to unanimous-lmously subject to a reservation by Mr, Lambert who expressed the view that the only form of Committee which would bo really effective would be one that had power to deal with questions of policy.    This view received no support from the other Members of the Committee.I would ask that Cabinet approval 3hould be given to the recomnendations at the earliest possible date.    The delay, hitherto unavoidable, is trying the patience of the House.(Intd)   A,C11. Downing Street, S.,^,.26th April 1921,
RECOH^IDATIOITS OP TIC&apos; COHMITT^,(1)   That an Estimates Committee of ID should be appointed.(2)   That the danger of considerable overlapping of functions rendered It undesirable that the Tstinates Committee should sit as a separate body in addition to the Select Committee on National Expenditure and the Public Accounts Committee and it is therefore proposed that the &quot;Estimates Committee and the Select Committee on National Expenditure should be mergod into one.t(3)   That In accordance with the procedure that has been adopted in the past in the case of the Select Commit boo on National Expenditure there should be one Committee only but power should be given to it to appoint Sub-ComBittces.(4)   That as In other cases of Committees whose functions continue from Session to Session, e.g*, the Public Accounts Committee, the same Members, as far as may be possible, should be appointed to serve each Session, and leave should be given to the Committee to sit during adjournments of the House if they so desire.(5)   That the Committee should have no power to deal with questions of policy or to advocate increased expenditure. Their functions should be to examine Estimates in the light of the Government13 policy with a view to discovering any possible economies and any items vfoicli appeared to involve or to have involved wasteful or unnecessary expenditure or seemed likely to lead to largo Increases of1 expenditure in future years.(6)   That the procedure in the House of Commons in regard to Supply should remain unaltered and that on the appointment of
the Estimates Committee no hard and fast rules should be laid down with the object cf securing the postponement of discussions on Estimates in Committee of Supply pending the receipt of Reports from the Kstimates Committee.    Rules of this character might create serious difficulties in regard to the business of the House and might also lead in some cases to hurried and insufficient consideration of the Estimates by the Committee itself.     It is suggested therefore that it should be left to the Government in arrang-ing the order in which the Estimates are to be discussed in the House to bear constantly in mind the proceedings of the Estimates Committee with a view to meeting the convenience both of the Committee and the House as far as possible.     If it should be found subsequently that some alteration in procedure was desirable any necessary change could be made in the light of the experience gained by the Committee.(7)   That there should be attached to the Committee an oxperienced member of the staff of the House of Commons whose function it would be to prepare material for the Committee^ deliberations and to render advice and assistance to the Committee and the Chairman in particular.    Being a servant of the House of Commons this official would occupy an Independent position in relation to Ministers.(8)   That this official should not be empowered to call forInformation from Government Departments except on the instruc-tions of the Chairman of the Committee, nor have the right of access to departmental papers, but the Committee shall havethe ordinary right of sending for persons, papers, and records.(9)   That 310 further staff should be appointed at the present time and that the Committee should decide by experience whether the creation of any additional staff was required. (10)   That the selection of the Chairman should be left tothe Committee.
