Letter of Thanks t* Volunteers.The Sub-Committee appointed by the Supply and Transport Committee this morning to prepare a draft of a letter of thanks from the Prime minister to volunteers who have served in the emergency organizations during the reoent orisis, suggeet that the letter should be in the following terms:-Sir,I have much pleasure in personally thanking you. and in oonveying to you the thanks of my colleagues, for the services you have rendered during the national emergenoy of the past few days.Had the danger which threatened the oountry materialised, the work whioh you undertook would have been effective in maintaining&apos;the supply of the necessaries of life and would have preserved the great mass of the people from extreme privation and misery:   and I believe that the readiness whioh you and others have shown in coming to their rescue will be remembered with gratitude by all sections of the community.I trust that no further demand will have to be made on your services. If  however   a fresh necessity should arise, I feel sure you will respond , with no less publio spirit and zeal than have been shown on the present oooaslon by all the voluntary workers in the Food, Transport and other emergency organizations.X am, etc.The Sub-Committee have assumed that the letter will be sent to all volunteers who have served and are now being demobilized - not at present to those who continue to serve, and not to volunteers who have registered their name;:, but have not been called up.They think  however, that some special recognition is due to persons in responsible positions, 3uch as the Chairman of the Voluntary Service Committees, who have been engaged for many months in seoret work in the preparation for such an emergency as the present.   They suggest that -rhen this printed letter is sent to them It should be accompanied by a letter signed by the Minister in charge of the Department under which they have served, mentioning in apecifio terras the work they have done and expressing in the warmest terms the appreciation of the Government.EDWARD TROUP.16th April, 1921.Submitted 5.E.54.E.S. 16.4.21,
