KHIS DOCIMT-NT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BKITAlTNIC MfcJTSTY^ GOVERN :ENT).In understanding the attitude of mind of people in mining areas it Is useful to enquire as to their sources of information.In this matter as In many others one has the Impression that in industrial areas there is ceaseless propaganda and statement of the case, from one point of view only  or mainly so.To remedy this defect, so far as it exists, requires a comprehensive effort, but I think the attention of my colleagues should bo drawn at this time to the statement made in the &quot;Morning Post&quot; of to-day (April 6th) in the column &quot;The Fay of the World&quot;.    It is to the effect that going through the coalfield the correspondent found in the mining villages that on the Saturday afternoon piles of London papers arrived, but that in the little shops in which they were on sale thoy proved to consist solely of copies of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, and that it was not until he reached the main-line junction that the correspondent found other news-papers to be available.It should not be difficult to remedy in some measure this one-sided presentation of the oase, and I suggest that steps be taken to that end without delay.SECRET.CABITJPT .C.P.2901,GOAL STRIKE PROPAGANDA.Memorandum by Dr, Addison,(Sd)   C, Addison.April 6th 1921.
