ANNEX II to C.P 2900.

April 30th, 1921.

The inhabitants of Upper Silesia summoned under Article 88 of the Treaty of Versailles to chose by their votes whether they desire to be attached to Germany or to Poland gave their decision on March 20th, 1921.

The results of the vote established by communes have, after verification, been confirmed by the Inter-Allied Commissions Ordinance of April 24th.

A separate report gives an account of the voting. On the whole the voting operations were regular. The results of the plebiscite can then in a general fashion serve as a legitimate basis for the work which is intended to fix the frontier between Germany and Poland.

It is on the data thus established that the Inter-Allied Commission is called in conformity with paragraph 5 of the annex to Article 88 of the Treaty to address to the Allied Powers "a proposal as to the line which must be adopted as the German frontier in Upper Silesia taking into account the vote expressed by tho inhabitants as well as the local geographical and economical situation".

The Inter-Allied Commission before undertaking the examination of the problem has had to wait until it was in possession of the exact elements of the situation and in particular the final results of the vote. Urged by the Supreme Council&apos;s message which reached it on Monday April 24th to formulate its proposals in view of the forthcoming conference at London it has not been able to examine in common the question in all the detail which is demanded by a problem which touches so deeply the general interests of the Allied Powers.

That is why representatives of the Three Powers whose agreement has continued during 14 months of government think it necessary to give expression to their regrets that they were
were not able to reach this unanimous conclusion which it would still be their desire to reach.

Further, the Commission considers that without delaying the despatch of the present report and in order to emphasise the desire of its members to arrive at a common proposal it can even now notify in what respects agreement has already been obtained before giving, expression to the initial views of each delegation.

The Treaty of Versailles refers in two exquisite and repeated a manner to the frontier which must be fixed as a result of the plebiscite for anyone to stop at the theory enunciated by one of the contending parties and which would only tend to render useless the actual works of the Commission. The Commission is in agreement in considering that the theory of the indivisibility of Upper Silesia finds no support in the Treaty.

Having then to draw a frontier the Commission found itself faced with the precise dispositions of the Treaty which oblige it to take account.

1. Of the votes expressed by tho inhabitants.

2. Of tho local geographical and economic situation.

These prescriptions are besides only a reminder of the uniform method followed by the Peace Conference in solving the questions relating to the numerous frontiers arising out of the execution of the different treaties of peace.

The interpenetration of the two races raises in Upper Silesia as it raised in the case of the other frontiers delicate problems and the rights of minorities must be guaranteed on each side of the frontier.

Passing then to the examination of tho geographical and economical situation the Commission recognised that the solution to be found must assure the maintenance of the economic output of the mining and industrial regions of Upper Silesia.
It is on this point that the French representatives has laid before the Commission a plan according to which the allocation of the mining and industrial basin of Upper Silesia to Poland would be subject with the consent of this latter State to the control of long duration over this region of an inter-allied economic organisation composed of representatives of France, Great Britain and Italy and invested with the double mission.

1. of assuring in the general interest the maintenance of the economic output of the basin and

2. Of supervising the execution of the agreements which would eventually charge to the basin a contribution to the reparation due by Germany to the Allied Powers.

Such a system of guarantees not being foreshadowed in the Treaty the representatives of Great Britain and Italy do not feel themselves in a position to discuss this proposal without referring it to their Governments. They have accordingly adhered to the common report with this reserve.

REPOKT 0? mi FRENCH KE?RS *:BHTATIVE OK trade    :&apos;.TA3LI&apos; &apos;-KI Ei$T 0? THS OBRKAW FROHTIEK IN UPPER SILESIA.The Plebiscite cf March 20th definod the respeotive positions of tho Polish end G-erman partisans in Upper Silesia undor conditions sufficiently clear to allow of the tracing of the new German frontier in ouch a way as to satisfy the veto of the inhabitants as well as the interests, as important as they are ocmplex, which are at issue.The Vote of tho inhabitants cf both way3 cf thinking r^akes it possible to trace a frontier which, whilst taking full account of the interests cf Upper Silesia itself, assures at the same time the maintenance of the economic output of the mining and industrial basin by making it participate to the utmost in the 3errice of reparations whose exact settlement is of importance in the settlement cf all the European countries.Tho popular r&amp;to in Upper Silcre&amp;a has in a general manner rerifiod and confirmed tho data which wore already known to tho so who-framed the Sroaty of Versailles, data which wore based-as much on tho -etlmrrgraphic- map -cf these regions as on the political map established as a result of tho Reichstag elections.Tho only new clement, if not indeed unforeseen, was introduced by the out-rotors who represented 191&quot;15^names c&amp; the voting list cut of a total of 1,221*016* Without discussing tfeo actual value of those roten which represent 16$ of the wholo it is inportant to observethatOppeln, April 30th, 1921.
that their distribution throughout the territory renders delicate certain appreciations and would entirely falsify certain comparisons, for whilst, to take an extreme example, in one Commune the number of voters actually equals the figure of the resident population of every age, in another it remain below half this figure. From the fact of this very variable proportion between the number of the voters and the real number of the population which is due to a very large extent to the out-voters, it results that every general comparison contains a co-efficient of appreciable error, and that the totalisations which the Treaty does not foreshadow, since the vote must be determined by Commune, ought not to procede examination of the facts and still loss summarily decide the question by an operation which would only contain apparent mathematical precision. It will further be useful to observe at once that the Vote of certain parts of the Plebiscite area is not of the slightest interest to Poland since it can only be allocated to Czeche-Slovakia under Article 83 of the Treaty of Versailles. This reason in addition to others still stronger shows sufficiently that no decisive calculation can be based on a total result which would decide the allocation of the whole of Upper Silesia by means of the absolute majority of votes.

In face of the evident clearness of the text of Article 88 compared with Article 109 which had laid down for Slesvig a different procedure as far as concerns one of the two zones, it would be superfluous even to mention this point if it had not been contradicted by the German Government in its Note of April 1st, which claims the indivisibility of Upper Silesia.

The proposal of the French Delegation concerning the fixation "of the frontier of Germany in Upper Silesia" takes then as its point of departure the examination of the Vote of each Commune in the area whilst seeking to find on the map the point of meeting of the Polish and German masses
Polish and G-erman masses whioh aro respectively based on the Polish and German frontiers of Upper. Silesla*The result of this examination i3 as follows The vote in oach commune having decided tho national aspirations of tho majority, the result is obtained by the establishment of a map of tho aspirations of the population according to tho principles which aro used in the making of e th nographioal mapi-Jf the communes which voted for Germany are coloured differently to those which voted for Poland the existence of a German -block la observed in tho West and of a Polish block in tho East,      On tho extremes of these two blocks there is naturally somo inter-penetration, but the Polish mass appears on the map as clearly as the Gorman mass.    In each of these masses there aro islands of the other nationalty. The German islands in the Polish zone aro formed by the townsj their population i3, it is true, important, but it is not tho population of these towns,which is to a large extent a floating population,which constitutes the national basis of tho country.    It is tho resident population,- the peasant and the workman.According to the principles which have been constantly applied during the Peace Conference, tho frontier ought to follow the limits of the two masses, German and Palishj as rogsrds tho islands of one nationalty inserted in tho mass of the other thoir fate is bound to that of the mass which surrounds thorn; but the rights of minorities must bo guaranrteedV to thorn. That is the second part of tho question on which tho procedure of the Peace Conference has been uniform.Tho application of tho preceding principles assures to Poland not only complete possession of the area of the mining; concessions but also tho covering of this territory to the ftest by a strip of Polish territory.
Such aro the-basea on which the diso-ussicn of tho future frontier must take place j     it goes without suyijig that the laying down sf tjfc) frontier can ccmpriso In its different parts variations susceptible of consideration and discussion,That such is actually the problem to be faced iseasy to see if we group the p3.ebiseite results in an orderwhose logical and natural oharaet&amp;r oearaot be -ctotttotfci/odThe annex/table which contains all the necessary justification makes long explanations. unrobessaryP   lb is a graph representing the Polish aspirations leaving the present Polish frontier and following its axis Sourly-East to Korth-&apos;7eat which is at tho sane time the axis of the mining basin and that of tho means of communication^If the- Polish aspirations wore not manifested at the point of contact with the Polish frontiers and if a German strip separated them from Poland,, tho problem cf the tracing of the frontier would indood appear to be insoluble-; but this is not the case.   On tho contrary, the five Krolse which border on the Polish, fr^ntior and whioh also belong to the raining basin give a strong Polish majority4   The frontier Kroiso of Rybnik, Pless, KatUwitz-Bural, Beuthen-P.ural and Tarnowitz gave 2S23S1 votes.for Poland and 160244 for Germanyp a majority of more than 100,000 votes in favour of Poland,It is worth remarking that this frontier region supplies more than half of the Polish vote given in Upper Silosia; it is also the most densely populated region because it is the home of more than one-third of the population of the plebiscite area.   The indications given by the vote have accordingly a considerable importance*As regards the frontier Kroiso and in certain oases surrounded by thorn are situated to the West       Krelse which complete tho mining basin*
They are the urban centres of Beuthen-town, Ktnigshutte, KattoH-itz town and Gleiwitz town, the industrial kreis of Zabrzo and in part also the Kroise of Ratibor-rural and of Tost-Gleiwitz.    This group less considerable than the preceding p-roup in population n;ave 97018 vot$s for Poland ana 17&quot;937 votes for Germany, or &amp; majority of 80,000 votes in favour of the latter.we ere now at the limit of the territory of the mining concessions and if grouping the two zones already referred to we summarise the votes we find 359399 Polish votes and 338181 German votes, or a majority of 21068 votes for Poland.This calculation of whioh all the details are jlven in the table annexed and which covers the whole ground indicates the dominant position which the Poles hold in the industrial and mining basin of   Upper Silesia.The Polish aspirations moreover do not cease at the limits of the basin which spreads its influence over the neighbouring agricultural districts t Lublinitz, Tostgleiwitz, Gress-Strehlitz and part of Eosel.    To this new stage and including all the territory from the Polish frontierThis majority for Germany is due entirely to the vote of the towns jf Beuthen-Konigshutte, Kattowitz and Gleiwitz which respectively gave 53323 votes for Poland and 116557 vctes for Germany or a majority in &quot;arour of the letter of 83234 votes.   We ought here to recall the observation already made regarding the principles followed by the [Peace Conference, e.g. the rural and working population mark the national character of a country and not the urban population.
m find out of tho total population of L53143T&apos;inhabitants&apos; 42C667 Polish -*otes and 397087 Gen-nan &quot;votes or a majority of 23530 votes in favour- of Poland.The remainder of,thn jcamoy towards Germany passes across Gorman majorities becoming more and none dense until ive reach the Xreiso of Krcusburg and Leobsohutz which it is well to remember were only included in plebiscite area for reasons foreign to thoir aspirations.The vote of tho inhabitants of tho industrial basin uos expressed as wo ha&quot;a already seen in a majority in favour of Poland, a majority to vrtiioh is opposed a vary strong German minority.This situation makes one indoor -r^flj^ot-aniJ-^a^^OT^oko---------some objection.r-:ill not tho allocation of tho mining basin to Poland ha-ro the effect of compromising the economic output whilst the maintenance of this basin in Germany wmild assure as we know from experience its regular exploitationoOn the other hand will not the allocation of the industrial nnd mining basin to Poland damage the service of reparations due by Germany to the Allies since the Treaty of Versailles dispenses the territories allocated to Poland from participation in reparation *In spite of appearances the first objection has now no longer any basis.It is true that Germany exploited Upper Silesia in an excellent manner before the war, but present conditions are entirely different to those      that period.A profound nat onal difference separates henceforth in the Milesian basin the Polish minors from the German managing classes.    Ho decision, no action of the Allied Powers is
capable of forcing tho Polish minors to accept subjectionto their old masters, subjection from whioh they have beenfree since tho setting up of the Inter-Alliod Commission,and from which they ar3 firmly resolved to remain forever free,    Rather than accept it they will have recourse to insurrection.$he delivery of the whole or part of themining area of Upper Silesia to Germany would thus most certainly result not in restoring it to pro-war conditionsof exploitation but in compromising for a lon  time if notin ruining the mining basin.     This solution lamentablefrom the point of view of the general economy of Europe asfrom tho point o^ view of tho interests of tho A11103 would create in addition a state of affairs most dangerous forthe peace of Central &quot;europe. &apos;Moreover, the delivery of tho mining area to Polandwhowoulo1 not create the same danger for the miner/satisfied in his national aspirations would ha^o no reason not to work as much as now.     Pome difficulties would arise, however, from the fact that arbitration in industrial disputes would pass to the Polish Government naturally little suspect of tenderness towards the Gorman managements It would no longer belong as now to an impartial organisation.If indeed for the 11 months that the Intor-Alliod Government has lasted all strikes in the mines have been avoided if production aleo has boon regular and the output constantly in the ascendant this is due to fact that between the Polish masses and the Gorman management a third arbiter has arisen speaking in the name of the Allies and who has   onjoyed the full confidence of tho working population.
Experience of C^mnont in Upper Silesia allows us to affirm that in orders to maintain the output it is necessary to intoppose between the two national and hostile elements c-.rr ^sponding to tho two social classes an Inter-Allied organisation able to judge industrial disputes or to arb itr at o th er eon *If tho Peace Treaty permits the establishment of ouch on organisation in tho case of allocation tp Poland nothing cn tho contrary authorises us tc impose it upon Germany if Upper Silesia returns to her.    Were she to accept It, moreover, it would be a dead letter for the miners will n*t agree to return bene th tho German yoke.One oannot, without danger, Icbo sight of the fact that the 360,000 Polish votes in tho industrial basin do not represent a backward population *f isolated and easily led peasants.    The mass of those votes is farmed by almost the whole of the miners of the basin, - 180,000 workmen, whose organisation has developed in accordance with the pre-wav German seoial laws, such aa the law on Councils Of exploitation, and. whose organisation yields not at all to the powerful organisation of the management.    This working mass is organised and conscious ^events have shown it. We must examine this question as a whole and we must not lose sight of the fact that the groat mass of the workmen of thee basin believe that they have actually won their independence now that they have hoard how the industrial basin has voted.    A German :;.rmy of Occupation alone could restore It and for a time only to a state it does not desire.The necessity for maintaining the output of the mines and of the factories is then in this particular in exact accord with the vote expressed by the active majority of the industrial basin.     It is in conclusion in the general interest as well as in the internet of the Allies from the
economic point of via? to allocate the Upper Sileslan mining area to Poland under&apos;tho condition that the necessary dispositions are taken to ensure the output as well as the interests of the 0-a*Yian minority.The second objection concerning the service of reparations duo by Germany and which would be partly guaranteed by the possession of Upper Silesia can equally be solved in a mnnnor entirely satisfactory to the interests at etakoiFo^ this purpose it in sufficient that Poland under-takes to assume such a part of rep-ration charges as shall be fixed in agreement with her.     Certain solutions can bo imagined which would ensure easy collection of this parfunder the guarantee of the Powers.     The Information which has come to the knowledge of the French representative allows him to think that Polish agreement on this point is certain.In conclusion, tho French representative expresses the opinion that there must bo allocated to Poland the area of the Polish majority situated on tho right bank of the Oder and which Includes besides the zone of the mining concessions the strip of territory which separates it from the German mass.The report of the result of the whole of the vote which has been given above has led us to state that the Polish majority is maintained between tho Oder and the present frontier of Poland right up to the neighbourhood of the northern limit of the Kreiso of Lnbinitz Gross-Strehlitz and of part of the Kreis of ftosel which lies on the right bank of the Oder.
On looking more closely into the-qtuestlon-ire have come to tho conclusion under reserve of such alterations as shall take into account the vote and the looal ^g^sc^aphlo-&apos; al and economic situation that the line should be the line drawn in rod on tho sketch map annexed.    This line leaves to Germany all that part of the Kreis of Kosel on the right bank which in the neighbourhood of Leschnitz and Gogolin has a Gorman majority and for the sane reason that part of the Kreis of Lublinitz which surrounds Guttonthe.     It includes bedides a few communes of the Kreis of Rosenberg which border on Poland and which voted for that country,Tho zone thus defined which would be allocated to Poland includes 807601 voters of whom 415177 voted for Poland and 389604 for Germany-, or a respective majority of 51,4 and 40,6 per cent, and a difference of 25573 votes in favour of Poland, which corresponds by application of the ordinary co-efficienfta to majority of 44700 inhabitants.This difference Is moreover only a feeble indication cf the real majority of the Polish population in this zone, Without the out-voters there remain only the actual inhabitants.     Under this head and taking into account the proportion of 20 and of SO per cent of the out-voters votes which can be respectively attributed to Poland rod Germany there ist aro out of a total of 90918 persons of this category with a right to vote 54510 who must ho given to Germany,     This would Imply from 25573 votes to 30091 votes as the difference in favour of Poland.Such a difference corresponds by the application of the ordinary co-efficienti to a majority of 138,000 Inhabitants^-(Sd)   Lo Rond,

ANNEX IV TO C.P. 2900.

REPORT OF THE BRITISH AND ITALIAN REPRESENTATIVES.

Translation.

1. GENERAL APPRECIATION OF PLEBISCITE.

The official figures of the vote in the plebiscite territory give the result of 707,605 votes for Germany and 479,359 votes for Poland: which gives a German majority of 208,346 votes, that is to say a proportion of 59,6 per cent in favour of Germany (Annex I)

Out of the 1522 Communes and ? (of the latter only these are included in which a separate result has been obtained) 844 have voted for Germany and 678 for Poland.

The annexed maps (Annexes 2 and 3) show clearly the proportion of the Votes in each Commune.

The results of the vote indicate that the plebiscite territory can be divided into three distinct zones (Annex 4) of which two zones (A and B) have a very clear ? graphical unity, while the third (C) shows a mixed population. To give details:

A. ZONE A. A north western and south western zones composed of the following districts: Kreuzburg, Rosenberg, Oppeln, Cosel, Ober-Glegau (part of the district of Neustadt within the area of the plebiscite), Loebshuetz and Ratiber.

In this zone the German majority is decisive/
B.   Zone B,   South eastern zone composed of the districts of Rybnik and Pless.    In this zone there is a remarkable majority in favour of Poland; since 105,725 votes were given to Paland and 46,593 to Germany,&apos; which makes a proportion of 69% in favour of Poland.   In this zone also the ethnographical unity of the population is remarkable, although it is not so marked as in the preceding zone in view of the presence of numerous and important groups of the German minority.    Ihe results are as follows:-POLAND.Pless/decisive; since 327,629 votes were given to Germany, While 76,479 votes have been attributed to Poland, that is to say a proportion of 81 per cent in favour of Gormany.This majority extends the whole length of the zone, and is only rarely interupted by quite small Polish enclaves: which clearly shows the ethnographic-al unity of the country.    The detailed results are the following:-Kreuaburg.........       96.1 per centRosenberg    ........       68.1 per centOppeln - town  ..... 94,9% ) 74 q&amp;Oppeln - district     69.4ft J    0/0Cosel and Ober-glogau 80e5%Leobechuctz 99,6%Ratibor - town 90.5%) vcti Ratibor   - district   58.7%      1
-4*   531POLAND.Plees      ,,.,.    74% Rybnik     .....    65.2%0.    Zone C    Tho central and eastern zone composed of the districts of Lublinitz, Gross-strehlitz, Gleiwitz, Tarnowitz, Zabrze (Hindenburg), Beuthen, Kattowitz, and Koenigshuette.    This zone shows a small German majority since 333,383 votes have been given to Germany and 297,155 to Poland, with a proportion of 52,8% in favour of Germany.But, in this case, tho ethnographical unity is much less notable: the result of the vote shows in fact that it is a question of a mixed population spread throughout the zone with Polish preponderance in tha country and a stronger German preponderance in the towns.   The following are the details cf th3 result:-Lublinitz   .....      53% for GermanyGross-strehlitz       50,6% &quot; PolandTarnowitz     .....   61,62% for PolandGleiwitz * town 78.9% for Germany   ) 59.4% Gleiwitz -district 57.5% for Poland) for Germany,Beuthen-town     74,5% for Germany)   50% for Beuthen-diBtrict 59%    1!

II. M^mai^ and C,FgQ\l Aty kCQHOMIC&quot; INpJSTRI^L POINT OF Vp*f.Zone A.   It is almost entirely agricultural and of very limited industrial importance with a populationof 589,737 inhabitants.    It supplies, however,labour in quite remarkable numbers for the easternindustrial district.    These Workmen pass theireasternworking wee&quot;k in the/industrial districts and return to thsir homes on! Sundays. Zone B.   In this zone 20 coal mines are working, that is to say 12 in the district of Pless and 8 in tho district Rybnik.    The mines as a whale produoed during 1920, 6,566,997 tons of coal (6,873,070 tons in the year 1913)   against a total production of Upper Silesia of 31,670,046 tons during the same year 1920. (43,801,056 tons during the year 1913.)The annual coal production is thus divided:Pless       ..... 2,226,482 tonsRybnik     ..... 4,340,515   &quot;This zone has, however, a much larger productive possibility than tha^-with the amount now being produced.   It possesses in fact the principal&apos; coal/shows the mixed character of the population with a slight advantage for the Germans,    Thus the Germans have a majority of votes in a few of the industrial centres which are on the Polish frontier for example Myslowitz, Laurahuette and Siemanowitz.
- 5 -coal reserves of Upper Silesia and it is consequently considered by the experts as the coal basin of the region, the future of which promises to be rich and flourishing.The total Uppi;r Silesian reserves are calculated at 60 milliard tons at the depth which can be economically utilised and worked which is 1,000 metres.   Of these 60 milliards reserve the zone in question possesses more than two-thirds that is to say more than 42 milliards.Zone 0,   This zone, with the present production, is, from the economic point of view, the most important of the whole plebiscite area.   As the annexed maps (numbers 5,6 and 7) show, the industrial concentration in Beuthen-Gleiwitz-Kattowitz is especially notable and it holds the most important place in the territory in view of its density of population and its production.Certainly a more intense and rational exploitation of the mineral resources of the southern zone of Pless and Rybnik might enable these two districts  even to rival the production of the districts Beuthen-Gleiwitz-Kattowitz and even to exceed it; but at the present time the region in question represents the richest portion of the whole territory:It comprises the Comrrunes indicated in Annex T,    Its extent is 252,square kilometres and, though it represents only 2% of the zone subject to the plebiscite it comprises a population of
of   716,236 inhabitants, that is to say 34.72% of the total population of the territory (1919 census)D   In this region are comprised all the &quot;blast furnaces of Upper Silesia, 52.5% of the factories and foundries , and 52% of the coal mines which are actually being worked in the territory; finally it represents 65% of the whole coal production, (1920).It has already been shown that in the whole of the zone C. the Germans have obtained a majority of 52,8%; this majority, however, is even more increased in the industrial district in question where it amounts to 60.48% in favour of the Germans (Germany, 233,052 votes; Poland 152,259 votes).Certain characteristics of the whole industrial zone c, but especially of the central region, show the difficulty and almost the impossibility of dividing this zone without causing grave hurt to its industry.The greater part of ,the installations belong to a very limited number of powerful companies which, in many cases, are comprised under a single directorate and as it were in a single factory: the mine from which the mineral is extracted, the workshops which arrange the progressive stages of its treatment; the coal factories which produce the necessary combustible material to work the factories.The different mines, factories and foundries are so closely bound up and connected one with another and they depend,in such a large number of cases, one upon the other that to draw a frontier line across the zone in question would have as a result the closing/
closing of a large part of the most important establishments.The railways, both normal and narrow gauge which join tho different industries, the other means of communication, the electric cables which distribute power and light, the aqueducts and water conduits, in general all the public services, are installed and worked in absolute continuity as one indissoluble whole, in which are coordinated and perfected one with the other all the elements which relate to the interests of industry.In view of the intense exploitation of the zone, the richness of the sub-soil is a graveobstacle to any attempt at division.    There areestablishments situated in one commune which intheir underground workings touch the neighbouringCommune; as the metal industry must follow in its development the ramifications of the mineralstrata, the whole vast zone of the mines is coveredinwith a dense arxi/ertricable network of installationsof every kind.    Also the urban centres, which aroseand which have been developed concurrently with industry, show by their irregular and uncertainprocedure the characteristic traits of the regionin which a few important towns, joined togethercommunicating by a successive network of/suburbs,   form anuninterrupted urban entity inhabited by a dense andcompact population.In order/
In order to show more clearly the special character of the region in question  the following maps are annexedNo. 8a - showing the distribution of the companies which work the mines.No. 8b - showing the railway system.No. 8o - showing the water system.No. 8d -      n     the mines as regards their mineral properties.No. 8e - showing the boundaries of the properties,The considerations set forth atoa and $he statements made above lead us to the following conclusions.1, The vote has shown that this zone has a mixed population with a small German majority (52,8%)2. The German majority is shown more clearly in the most important portion of the zone that is to say in the district Beuthen-Gle iwitz-Kattowit z, (60,48%)3. The German majority is still more emphasised in all the towns (Gleiwitz 78.9%; Beuthen 74.5%; Kattowitz 85.3%; Koenigshutte 74.7%). which constitute the centres of sconomic life and of culture in the whole region.4,The zone taken as a whole is from the economic point of view indivisible, and it has specially this character in its central portion.Prom these facts one concludes that this zone should in its principal portion be attributed to Germany.Such/
Such, a decision,&quot; applied in its entirety would result in sacrificing the Polish minority which is generally very remarkable throughout the zone, and in sacrificing also the Polish majorities in the district of gross-strahlitz (50.6%) and in the district of Tarnowitz (61,62%).    Here it should he brought out that it is not considered opportune to emphasize the partial Polish majorities in the country districts of Gleiwitz, Burthen and Kattowitz, because it is not considered admissible to count the results in the country districts separately from those of the town districts Jcf the same name, which are in the centra of the country districts, since the town and the surrounding districts constitute a single small geographical unity and live upon common and inseparable interestsand relations .In taking into consideration the above it isconsidered fair to attribute to Poland the territories(contiguous to the present frontier line and thefrontier rat of Pless and Rybnik) which it is possibleto detach from tho two zones attributed to Germany,without, however, doin^ too grave an injury to thewhotherfunctioning of the industrial installations, the latter are in territory to be retained by Germany or in territory to bo cedad to Poland,    Such a decision is in accordance with the letter of the Treaty of Versailles, which lays down.that tho frontier must be traced taking into account the wish ercpressad by the inhabitants and the geographical and economic situation of the locality (Article 88 - Annex 5).
III.      WARKS ON THE VALIDITY CF THE VOTE.The condition laid down by the treaty ofVersailles for.- the plebiscites in MarienwerderthatAllenstein and Upper Silesia/the voting should be taken by communes obviously does not mean that the majority is to be counted according to the number of communes and that it is not to be established according to the number of inhabitants. That is to say,this condition cannot be interpreted to mean that a village of 100 inhabitants is to count the seme as a town of several tens of thousands of inhabitants for the purpose of the scrutiny of the voting.If one takes into consideration the super-&apos; ficial area of Upper Silesia and the great expense embraced by rural communes,even with quite small populations, one realizes that by a strict inter-pretation of voting by communes the inhabitants of a small rural centre could decide the lot of a territory much larger than that which could be decided by the inhabitants of a lar&amp;e town.Taking into account this consideration the commission excluded in its regulations from the number of conmnes those &quot;guts bezirke&quot; which had a population of less than 100 because they realized that it would be unjust that a few dozen inhabitants of big domains could - -     decide by their vote the future of a considerable expanse of territory.If
if the majority of votes  wore really to hecalculated by corxiunes, one would give a very differ*of the villages ent value to the voting of the inhabitants/and one would reduce to practically nothing the value of the vote of the inhabitants of the towns.    Some examples are c:iven below:-One inhabitant of:Kattowitz-town Kattowitz rural Gleiwitz town Gleiwitz rural Beuthen town Beuthen rural Koenigshuette Pless (district)&apos;Disposes by his vote, over a territory of:sq.m.   1741521 635 18551 -561 925 144 147449In conclusion it is obvious that the vote must be considered in its entirety.    The treaty of Versailles in laying down that the voting should take place by communes merely had in view the methods of voting, but the same treaty laid down that the lot of each locality should depend not only on the vote but on the geographical situation and the economic conditions.
IV.   PROPOSED DRAFT OP THE LINE WHICH SHOULD .&apos; BE ADOPTED AS FRONTIER OF GERMANY IN UPPEH SILESIA.Germany and Poland have each by the use of numerous publications supported their respective views claiming the greater part c  the plebiscite area,   Generally speaking one can say that Germany, laying stress on the absolute majority in the whole area as. regards votes, as also the total of the communes and making play with the economic reasons for the indivisibility of the area demands that Upper Silesia be given to her in its entirety.Poland maintains its right to tho most important portion of the territory, that is to say the region to the east of the Oder exclusive of the districts of Kreuzburg and part of the districts of Oppeln and Rosenberg,The considerations contained in the foregoing pages authorise the undersigned to put forward the following propositions,1.    The attribution to Germany of zone A. (districts of Kreuzburg, Rosenberg, Oppeln, Cosel, Ober-Glogau and Ratibor-town and country) except-ing a part of the territory situated on the riglifc bank of the Oder in the district of Ratibor, rural and a part of the district of Rosenberg, see below paragraphs 3A and 3H.
2,    Attribution to Germany of zone C0 (districts of Lublinits, Gross-Strehlitz, a part of Tivrnowitz, Gleiwitz. town and rural, Btfthcii town and rural, Kattowitz town and rural, Konigshutts and Z&amp;brse) and excluding from these districts the parts of tho territory mentioned in paragraphs 3.B,C.D,E,F.G. 50    Attribution to Poland of zone B, (districts of Eybnik and PI ess) 0   In addition the attribution to Poland of the followingAc    2ho communes of the district of Ratibor which are situated to the couth of the towns of Eatibor and Hohenbirken between the river Oder and the existing frontier of Eybnik.   Thus the frontier would be delimited by the course of the Oder to the south of Hatibor and Hohenbirken.Bo The Salient which the district of Gleiwitz rural forms with the communes of Gieraltowitz and of Preiswitz,Ce    The Salient which the district of Zabrze makes with the district of PI ess adopting as a frontier the water course of the Klodenitz immediately to the north of Klein Paniow,D.    That part of the Salient which the district of Kattowitz makes between the existing Polish frontier and the district of PI ess (including the mine and tov/n of Myslowitz which has shewn a German majority.E*    The north-eastern sector of the district ofNeuthen rural comprising the communes of Dombrowka,.....Birkenhain,
Birkenhain, Scharley Kamin Berosowitz (sic) and Beutsche-Piekar excepting the mine of Rosalien-Grube which feeds the industrial area with water,P.    The eastern part of the district of Tarnowitz including principally the communes of Radzionkau with its mines and Georgernberg,G.    The eastern sector of the district of Lublinitz to the east of the road Georgembexg-Kaschentin and to the east of the little stream Lisswarthe including the commune of WendzimuHo    The Salient formed by the part of the district of Rosenberg included between the communes of Jastrzigowitz and Gross Borek including &quot;these two communes.   Annex 9 shows approximately the frontier proposed.   Annex 10 gives a table of the conraines allocated to Poland in addition to the districts of Pless and Rybnik.   Annex 11 shows the population super-ficial area and mineral resources of the territory allocated to Germany and to Poland.In conclusion it is desirable to mention that a grcup of 9 communes (Makoschau, Kunzendorf, Paulsdorf, Bielschowitz, Noudorf, Kochlowitz, Barenhof, Halernba and Klodnitz) exists to the north of the northern boundary of the district of Pless which voted for Poland and which form so to say the meridional link between the central industrial area with which they have more or less strict interdependence.As
As this interdependence   is net primary the Italian representative, having regard to the Polish majority in these communes, considers it just that they should he attributed to Poland and hereby makes this proposition bearing in mind the difficulties of defining the frontier in this zone.Annex 12 shows the population superficial area and mineral resources of the district which would be attributed to Poland in the event of the acceptance of this proposition of the Italian representative.(Signed)    A.de Marinis, &quot; H.?.P.Percival.
