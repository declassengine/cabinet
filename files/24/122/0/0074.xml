I. NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN UNITED KINGDOM ONAPRIL 22, 1921.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unem-ployment figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent.in December, and averaged 2r4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :- Fer ceut-To the end of  -January   ...        ...                   - - - -        *&quot;February ...        ...        ...        ... ---        *&quot;     :!?March      ...        ...        ... ---        *&quot;       &apos;April.............  *......May        ..................     ]&apos;lJune       ...         ...        ...        ... ---                 1 .August    ..................     **September ...        ... - -        - - -        - - -     f&apos;October    ...        ...............November ... ---        ---        &quot;&apos;     ^[iDecember ...        ... ---The figures for 1921 are:-To the end of  * flJanuary   ...        ...        ... --- &apos;February ...        ...        - -        - -        - - - --    - ft jjMarch     ......... &apos;2.

GENERAL.3. Although the continuance of the coal dispute has resulted in increased unemployment during the past week, it appears that the discharges which have taken place are mainly restricted to the iron and steel and other large coal-consuming industries, and it is evident that manufacturers generally are endeavouring to keep their workpeople employed, if necessary on short-time, while stocks of coal last. In the North of England and Scotland, large numbers of workpeople in the iron and steel and cognate industries are unemployed or working short-time, and in South Wales the majority of tin-plate workers are idle. Many large engineering works have also been compelled to suspend their workpeople for an indefinite period. The shipbuilding industry remains very slack, this position being attributed to the general trade depression and the effect of foreign competition rather than to the coal dispute. In the woollen industry, the majority of mills continue on short-time, but the lace and hosiery trades have been adversely affected by the shortage of coal. The position in the boot and shoe trade is similar, large numbers of orders having been cancelled. The reports from the cotton industry are again encouraging. It is evident that a revival in this trade has actually commenced, and that conditions may improve considerably when the coal dispute is ended. Unemployment is increasing among pottery workers, and the shortage of coal has also adversely affected the fishing industry.II. EMERGENCY WORK.On the 19th October, the Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. A further statement was made in the House by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December.1. The schemes of work then outlined (which have been more fully described in Report No. 22 for the week ended the 18th March, 1921, and earlier reports to the Cabinet) included the following : (a.) Arterial Roads.The anticipating of a four years&apos; programme for arterial roads in London and in the Provinces.(b.) Road Maintenance.Pressing forward with the Ministry of Transport programme of road classifica-tion and maintenance grants.(c.) Housing.The acceleration of the - lay-out of roads and sewers on approved housing schemes-work brought forward as additional to the main programme.(d.) Unemployment Grants Committee.The distribution by the Unemployment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities on relief schemes other than house-building work and certain kinds of road work.(e.) Unemployment Insurance.The amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit.&quot;6140&quot;] B 2
2. More recently the following additional measures have been devised by the Government, viz. : (a.) The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921.Under this Act, which became law on the 3rd March, the rate of benefit was &apos; raised from 15s, to 20s. for men and from 12s. to 16s. for women, and it was provided that benefit might be drawn tor sixteen weeks in each of two periods running from the 3rd March, 1921, to the 2nd November, 1921, and from the 3rd November, 1921, to the 2nd July, 1922; after the last date benefit to be drawn to the extent of twenty-six weeks in each insurance year.(b.) Alternative Work.Alternative work has been arranged by the War Office at five national factories. This includes waggon-repairing, manufacture of medals, coin blanks, locomotives and new waggons and miscellaneous articles for the Post Office and for private firms.Alternative work has also been adopted at His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Industrial Establishments, but fresh entries for this work ceased on the 19th March. 1921.(c.) Short-time in Government Establishments.This policy was introduced on the 24th January, 1921, in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Establishments and in the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich Arsenal and other National Factories administered bv the War Office.It was also introduced, where practicable, in the remaining War Departments, Industrial and Semi-Industrial Departments and Factories from the 7th February. No further entries in Admiralty Establishments have been made since the 19th March. 1921.(d.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.This includes a considerable amount of decorating and repair work in Govern-ment Departments with a view to the absorption of unemployed painters and similar workpeople. The entire programme is expected to be completed by the middle of May and the numbers of men employed are being gradually reduced.3. Other Public Work. In addition, various Local Authorities throughout the country are employing labour on schemes of relief work which have not been assisted by Government grants.4. Summary of Labour engaged on Relief Schemes. (Including those for whom part-time employment is being provided.)Returns are received weekly from the Government Departments responsible and from the Local Authorities in regard to all the schemes of works indicated above, and the latest returns show that the number of men for whom emergency work has been found in this way is as follows : (a.) Schemes assisted by Government Grants:-Arterial Roads (a.) London           ...        ...        ...        ... 2,281(b.) Provinces        .......:.        ... 17,888Expediting of lay-outs on housing schemes (a.) London      i   ...        ...        ...        ... 534(b.)

(b.) Public Works put in hand by Local Authoritieswithout Government Grants ...         ...        ...       8,743Grand Total......     78,858As reports for the week ended the 22nd April have been received from only 332 Local Authorities out of 375 who were asked to supply information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of 80,000.(The Ministry of Transport estimate that employment has been found for some 20,000 men on road maintenance and repair work over and above those ordinarily so employed.)5. Government Scheme for the Employment of 50,000 ex-Service men to be trained in the Building Industry.Arrangements for carrying out the above scheme in conjunction with the employers&apos; organisations in Great Britain have now been completed, and posters announcing the scheme were displayed in Employment Exchanges on Monday, the 18th April.Statistical returns for the week are not yet available, but it is known that large numbers of applications have been received from candidates for employment. Progress has also been made in setting up the District Committees of Employers.III.  PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.1.
