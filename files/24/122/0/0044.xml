The Secretary-General,Under instructions from my Government, I have the honour to send you herewith the amendments to the Covenant proposed by the Government of the Netherlands, together with a brief commentary. ,You are doubtless aware that the amendments must be submitted before I larch 31st next. I have the honour to be, etc.,(Signed)   Van PANHUYS,To Sir Eric Drummond,Secretary-General of the League of Nations,Geneva.(Translation)AMENDMENTS TO THE COVENANT PROPOSE BY THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT.I. Article 4, paragraph 1.&quot;1.   The Council shall consist of Representatives of the United States of America, the British Empire, Prance, Italy and Japan, during the time that these States are Members of the League, together with the Representatives of four other Members of the League,    These four Members of the League shall be selected one at a time and by secret ballot for a term of tvo years.    If no Member obtains an absolute majority of votes at the first ballot, a new ballot shall be taken, but on thir occasion, the voting shall be confined to the two Members vrtio obtained tibelargest number of votes at the first ballot.    If
193at this ballot the two Members obtain an equal number of votes, tho President shall decide by lot.&quot;2. At each annual meeting the Assembly shall select two of the four Members. The term of office of these two Members shall date from January 1st of the following year.&quot;3,   J\To Member shall sit for more than two consecutive terms,     No Member ceasing to sit on the Council after one or two terms of two years can be re-elected before the expiration of a period of four years.&quot;4.   If a State represented on the Council ceases to be a Member of the League before the expiration of its term of office, the vacancy shall be filled at the next session of tho Assembly.&quot;5.   As a temporary measure and notwithstanding the provi-sions of paragraph 2 of this Article, the Assembly shall elect in the session of 1921 four non-permanent Members of the Council.&quot;6.   The terms of office of two of these Members shall be for one year and two for two years.    After the elections, the President shall draw lots to decide the respective durations of the terms of office.    The principle of non-re-eligibility shall not apply to the session of 1921.&quot;At its 1920 session, the Assembly unanimously recog-nised that Article 4 of the Covenant did not suffice to regulate the selection of the four non-permanent Members of the Council,     In proposing the substitution of the above six paragraphs for the first paragraph of the Article, the Netherlands Government has taken as a basis the discussions on this subject in the First Committee, as well as in the plenary sessions.With regard to the duration of the terms of office, the Netherlands Government had regard to the two currents of opinion which prevailed in the Assembly,     On the one hand, it was thought that the elections should not be for too long a period, so that each Member of the League might have a better guarantee of representation on the Council; on the other hand, it was feared that too short a term would weaken the influenco of&apos; the non-permanent Members,As a compromise, the Netherlands Government has declared itself in favour of a term of two years, adding a rule as to re-eligibility, which stipulates that the term may be extended for a single period.     If a lumber is not immediately re-elected, there must be an interval of at least four years between the two terras of office.The last two paragraphs proposed are merely temporary measures relating to the elections of 1921.The Netherlands Government shares the objections already raised at Geneva to the use of the words &quot;Principal Allied and Associated Powers,&quot; which appear in the first paragraph of the existing Article 4,    The wording proposed by the Netherlands Government takes these objections into consideration and further makes allowance for the exception-al position in which the United States is placed at the present time, assuring it of a seat on the Council as soon as it sees its way to joining the League.
minister. Article 5, paragraph 2.&quot;All matters dF procedure at meetings of the Assembly ft?- of the Council, including their Rules of Procedure, and the appointment of Committees to investigate particular matters, shall be regulated by the Assembly or by the Counoil and may be deoided by a majority of the Members of the League represent-ed at the meeting.&quot;The aim of the proposed amendment to Article 5 is twofold.   In the first place, it seems desirable that the Rules of Procedure, which were   adopted by the Assembly at its first session and which are now one of the funda-mental principles of the organisation of the League of nations. should be- mentioned in the Covenant.   Secondly, it should be expressly laid down that any modification of the Rules of Prwedure may be made by a decision of the Assembly by a majority vote.   It la true that such a provision exists In Article 23 of the present Rules of Procedure, but it is to be feared that, owSfcg tc the express stipulations regarding unanimity contained in Article 5 of the Covenant, objections might be raised to a modification of the Rules by a majority vote.On these grounds the Netherlands Government proposes that this new exemption to the rule of unanimity should be included In the Covenant itself; for this purpose it would be sufficient to Insert the words: &quot;their Rules of Procedure&quot; In paragraph 2 of Artjcle 5. as provided in the Dutch amendment.III. Article 6, paragraph o. Paragraph &amp; ef Article 6 is deleted.An Article 6a Is inserted:- &quot;The expenses of the League of Nations shall be borne by the Members of the League in tho proportions laid down in tho Financial Regulations adopted by the Assembly.The Assembly shall fix the annual budget of tho League and shall regulate its accounts.&quot;The Importance of financial questions was shown by the discussions at tho first session of the Assembly. The Assembly requested the Council to have a resolution prepared on this subject for the Assembly mee-Mng In 1921, and has already indicated certain guiding principles of the financial administration.    The Netherlands Government considers it desirable that a special Article of the Covenant should be devoted to this financial question, particularly to establish the following pointsFirst, It should be stipulated in the Covenant that rules regarding the finances of the League are to be laid down by the Assembly,,    Secondly, the essential rights of &quot;the Assembly with, regard to financial matters, that is, the right to fix the budget and regulate the accounts, should be included in the Covenant itself.    Thirdly, the method of allocation of the expenses of the League of Nations should not be dependent upon that of the Universal Postal Onion.On these grounds the Netherlands Government proposes that  he fifth paragraph ot Article 6 should be deleted, and a new Article 6a Inserted.

Annexe I-PROJET D&apos;AM EN DEMENT DE 1&apos;ARTJCLE n DU PACTE.w Toutes conventions entre deux ou plusieurs Membres de la Societe tendant a preciser ou a completer les engagements en vue du maintien de la paix ou de la collaboration internationale tels qu&apos;ils sont stipules dans ce Pacte, pourront etre non seulement approuvees par le Conseil ou 1&apos;Assemblee, mais encouragees par eux et negociees sous leurs auspices ; ces dispositions peuvent s&apos;appliquer aux engagements internationaux tels que les traites d&apos;ai bitrage, aux conventions complementaires en vue d&apos;etendre la competence de la Gourde Justice, aux ententes regionales comme la doctrine de Monroe, ou a toutes autres qui seront jugees, par le Conseil ou 1&apos;Assemblee, comme etant en accord avec le paragraphe icl de eel article.o Le Conseil ou l&apos;Assemblee pourront, en vue de ces fins, et a la demande d&apos;un nombre suftisant de -Membres de la Societe. provoquer la reunion de conferences spe-ciales ouvertes a tous les Membres qui se jugeront interesses. ^Annexe II.EXPOSE DES MOTIFS DE LAM EN DEMENT DE L&apos;ARTICLE 21 DU PACTEDE LA SOCIETE DES NATIONS.L&apos;article 21 actuel du Pacte a prevu que tpute entente internationale ayant pour objet de faciliter le maintien de la paix etait compatible avec le Pacte. il semble quapres une annee d&apos;experience, on puisse utilement preciser et completer ces dispositions.II est certain que la Societe des Nations a pour objet de maintenir et de multiplier les liens entre toutes les nations civiliseeset de les faire collaborer toutes a 1&apos;ceuvre gene-rale de paix et de solidarity internationale. Mais le Pacte n&apos;a pu prevoir, en vuedu main-tien de la paix, qu&apos;une procedure qui ne peut etre mise en mouvement que la 011 le con-flit ou tout au moins le dilferend est deja ne. Or, si la Sociele des Nations veut \ eritable-ment remplir sa tache, il faut non settlement qu&apos;elle soit prete a arreter le conflit, mais a prcvenir le dilferend et a 1&apos;empecher de naitre. Elle y tend deja, dans une certaine mesure, en preparant la conclusion d&apos;accords entre les Etats sur les realites les plus diverses, partout ou des intcrets peuvent se trouver en opposition. Mais ce ne sont, jus-qu&apos;a present, que des accords universels qui, par consequent a cause de leur universalite meme, ne peuvent se faire que sur des principes tres generaux et pour des objets limitcs.Ce systeme laisse forcement de cote les questions les plus complexes, lesdiflicultes les plus aigues, colics qui, presentant tin caractere local, n&apos;interessent qu&apos;un certain nombre de pays et desquclles il est vraiment impossible, dans 1&apos;etat actuel du monde, de deman-der a 1&apos;ensemble des nations de se preoccuper.11 ne suffit pas que la Societe des Nations permette simplement. comme le fait actuellement Particle 21, a des ententes de setablir entre certains pays. 11 faut que, dans le cadre du Pacte, la Societe puisse elle-meme, en vue du maintien de la paix, provoquer des accords, des conventions entre certains groupes de pays leur permettant d&apos;assurer plus completement soit leur securite nationale soit leur vie economique, de se donner des garanties mutuelles, de s&apos;assurer entre eux des procedures plus precises de reglement pacifique.le danger pour le monde serait de voir se creer des groupements independants et meme adverses. Au contraire, la paix du monde a tout a gagner a voir se grouper ensemble, pour une collaboration plus intime et plus reelle, les pays qui ont a faire face a des problemes communs et qui ont entre eux des aspirations et des interets scmblables. Mais a condition que ces ententes se fassent toujours avec 1&apos;appui de la Societe des Nations et d&apos;une fa?on conforme a ses principes; a condition egalement que le contact entre 1&apos;ensemble des Etats soit maintenu d&apos;une fa^on constante afin d&apos;etablir la colla-boration entre tous, chaque fois qu&apos;un interet general cst en jeu.
I&quot; Translation], Annex I.PROPOSED  AMENDMENT  OF  ARTICLE  21   OF  THE COVENANT&quot; All agreements between two or more Members of the League the object of which is to define or complete the engagements contained in this Covenant for the maintenance of peace or the promotion of international co-operation, may be not only approved by the Council or the Assembly, but also promoted bv these bodies and negotiated under their auspices. These provisions may also be applied to international engagements such as treaties of arbitration, to supplementary conventions intended to extend the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice, to regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine, or to any other engagements which, in the opinion of the Council or the Assembly, conform to the conditions of the first paragraph of this Article.For such purposes the Council or the Assembly may, provided that a sufficient number of Members of the League submit a request to that effect, summon special con-ferences which may be attended by all Members which consider that their interests are involved. &quot;j Translation], Annex II.STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR THE AMENDMENT OF ARTICLE 21 OF THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Article 21 of the Covenant, as it stands, lays down that nothing in the Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international understandings the object of which is to facilitate the maintenance of peace. It seems that after a year&apos;s experience these provisions might well be made more precise and complete.It is indisputable that the object of the League of Nations is to maintain and mul-tiply the bonds between all the civilised nations and to make them all co-operate in the general work of peace and international solidarity. The only procedure which the Co-venant has been able to provide for the maintenance of peace cannot be set in motion until the conflict, or at least the dispute, has already arisen. If the League of Nations, however, really wishes to fulfil its task, it must be ready not merely to stop the conflict, but to anticipate the dispute and prevent its arising. It is already taking some steps in that direction, in preparing for the conclusion of international agreements on the most diverse subjects, wherever opposing interests exist. Up to the present, however, these are onlv universal conventions which, on account of their universal character, can onlv embody very general principles and be applied to restricted objects.This system necessarily avoids the most complex questions and the most acute difli-culties, which, since they are local in character, affect only a certain number of countries. In the present state of the world, it is quite impossible to ask all countries to concern themselves with these problems.It is not enough for the League of Nations merely to allow, as provided by Article 21, understandings to be arrived at between certain countries. It is essential that, for the maintenance of peace, the League itself shall, by the terms ot the Covenant, be enabled to promote among certain groups of States agreements and conventions which may permit them to secure more completely either their national safety or their economic life, to exchange mutual guarantees and to agree among themselves upon more definite methods of procedure for peaceful settlement.The formation of independent and even hostile groups would constitute a danger for the world. On the other hand, the peace of the world has everything to gain from the formation of groups which aim at fostering a closer and more real co-operation between the countries which have to face problems common to them all and which possess similar hopes and interests. It is, however, essential that these understandings should be arrived at only with the assured support of the League of Nations and in accordance with its principles. It is also essential that contact should be maintained as closely as possible between all States, in order that co-operation may be established among all countries, whenever a common interest is at stake.
