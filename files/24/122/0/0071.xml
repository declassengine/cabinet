[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government?]366CP.   2871Printed for the Cabinet,   April 1921.THE SITUATION IX EGYPT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.f/ Mr. CHURCHILL has recently circulated to the Cabinet a memorandum on his conversation at Cairo with the Sultan of Egypt, together with some reflections of his own on the Egyptian situation.When the intention of the Colonial Secretary to visit Egypt was first announced, Lord Allenby telegraphed in some anxiety to ask whether this visit had anything to do with the Egyptian situation, but was assured by a comforting telegram from Mr. Churchill and by a message from me that the &quot; visit was not connected with the Milner Report nor with the future of Egypt, for which the Colonial Secretary was not responsible.&quot; Lord Allenby made this known in Egypt, and the assurance had a pacifying effect.I have no wish to complain of Mr, Churchill&apos;8 audience with the Sultan, which, in the case of so distinguished a visitor, was natural and inevitable, although in the conversation that ensued I am far from being clear that the assurance contained in my telegram quoted above was strictly observed. However that &quot;may be, I am clear as to this namely, that the Sultan displayed in this interview many of those characteristics which a closer familiarity with the regions which the Colonial Secretary has now taken under his sway will teach him are inseparable from the conversations of Oriental potentates, and, indeed, that His Highness consistently and successfully &quot; pulled the leg &quot; of my colleague. I will proceed to show how thorough and almost brazen was the operation.1. The Sultan&apos;s first complaint was that &quot; whereas the country was quite quiet three or four weeks ago, it had now all been disturbed again by the imperious wish of the British Government to have a delegation on the Milner Report.&quot;Would it be believed that the suggestion of this delegation emanated not from ourselves but from Lord Allenby last summer, and that it was the result of an agree-ment between the Sultan and himself ? During his visit to England last autumn Lord Allenby frequently insisted, at the Cabinet and elsewhere, on the fulfilment of this promise ; and when the time for fulfilment came, not only did the Sultan choose the members of the delegation himself, but he fixed the date for their departure. In fact, when the Sultan remarked with ingenuous candour to Mr. Churchill: &quot; Why not leave the initiative in these matters to the men on the spot to myself and Lord Allenby with whom 1 am in complete accord ?&quot; he correctly described the exact procedure which had been followed.2. The Sultan then went on to denounce his own Prime Minister, Adly Pasha, and said he could not understand why we had forced a change of Ministry on him, and not left the matter to Lord A lien by and himself.This, it may be remarked, is precisely what we did: It had always been under-stood that the stop-gap Ministry of Xassim Pasha should be superseded when the future political status of Egypt came under discussion, and, indeed, he had only accepted office on that condition. Accordingly, when the situation arose, we received on the 14th March the following telegram from Lord Allenby: &quot; The Sultan, on my advice, is approaching Adly Pasha to form Ministry and delegation.&quot;Two days later, having offered the post to Adly Pasha, the Sultan &quot; assured Lord Allenby that he would do all he could to help the new Ministry.&quot;How loyally he has carried out this promise is shown by the diatribes against his own Prime Minister which he poured into Mr. Churchill&apos;s ear, and which recall the;      [6L34]
exchange of mutual confidences that sometimes took place between the illustrious Queen Victoria and Mr. Gladstone.As to the reasons for this ill-concealed hostility, the Cabinet may like a few words of explanation. The dislike entertained by the Sultan for Adly unquestionably the ablest and most reliable of modern Egyptian statesmen- is of long standing. As far back as October 1918 Sir R Wingate reported a somewhat acrimonious conversation which had taken place between Adly and the Sultan, shortly after the latter&apos;s accession, when the former had to complain of His Highness&apos;s practice of entertaining visitors with abuse of his Ministers.The hostility has continued to grow, for Adly is himself honest in money matters and disapproves of anything that savours of corruption in others. But, in the Sultan&apos;s eyes, Adly&apos;s chief sin is that he stands for constitutionalism and for the theory of Ministerial responsibility not, in all probability, from any natural love of democratic ideals, but from a well-founded fear of the abuses which inevitably would arise were the present Sultan or any member of his family to be left with the power of overriding the wishes of an elected Assembly. Whether or no His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; are woefully misinformed of the influence and strength of Adly Pasha,&quot; the fact remains that the Sultan himself failed to find any other one of the leading statesmen of Egypt able at the critical moment to form a Government. Not only has Adly done so, but the Government, when formed, was received with acclamation by the people, and for the first time for several years Ministers are able to dispense with police protection and are applauded when they appear.3. The Sultan then went- on to complain of the &quot; premature publication of the Miluer Report last August/&apos; and this complaint was endorsed on behalf of the Cabinet by the Colonial Secretary.As a matter of fact the Milner Report was not even written in August last, and was not published until February of this year, and then only as the result of a Cabinet decision taken on the 4th January, 1921.What the Sultan and Mr. Churchill were alluding to was the memorandum prepared by Lord Milner in July last, in which the outlines of a possible settlement with Egypt were sketched. This document - was not published, prematurely or otherwise, by His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was communicated to the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; in August last by Zaghlul Pasha, and was copied thence by other papers. Concealment being impossible, it was telegraphed in full to Cairo on the 21st August. Its publication there was in any case inevitable, seeing that four of ZaghluFs followers had been sent by him to Egypt to explain the proposals to their fellow-countrymen.4. Finally, Air. Churchill, stepping boldly on to ground ordinarily reserved for the Foreign Office, not merely let the Sultan know quite clearly what were his own sentiments (with which the Cabinet is already familiar) on the matter, but even expressed the opinion, which was warmly endorsed by the Sultan, that &quot;it was quite possible that no agreement would be reached.&quot; This exchange of confidences will not, I fear, render my task more easy. It is surely better from every point of view that an agreement should be made if this can be done w7ith prudence and honour. I have myself been one of the severest critics of some of Lord Milner&apos;s proposals, but I have never conceded the view that an agreement is both desirable and possible, and I have never ceased to work for that end. &apos; Lord Milner himself, who had abundant experience of the extremists, always held that such an agreement was feasible with the more moderate Egyptian elements, who look to Adly as their leader. Lord Allenby has never given any indication of regarding an agreement as impossible of attainment, and has expressly indicated the modifications of the Milner proposals by which, in his opinion, it might, be attained.5; Mr. Churchill concludes that the present movement in Egypt is very largely run by the Pasha class, who are seeking to get the whole country into their hands and to re-establish a reactionary regime.Far from this being a true picture, it is the Sultan and Pashas of the type of Mohamed Said who are reactionary and dread any change in the status quo as being likely to curtail the exercise of their prerogatives.It is true that the rich landowners have been the largest subscribers to the Nationalist funds; but the driving force of nationalism is in the &quot; intelligentsia,&quot; which is far from being confined to the ;Pasha class, whilst more liberal-minded statesmen, like Adly and his followers, look to the political settlement with England as
providing a firm basis for constitutional principles which will prevent, or at least circumscribe, the many abuses which the present Sultan, like the ex-Khedive, only desires to foster to his own advantage.In conclusion, it is satisfactory to note that since Mr. ChurchiH&apos;s departure from Egypt affairs have not pursued the rather sombre lines which his diagnosis might have led us to expect. The despised Adly Pasha has handled Zaghlul with great tact and success. The latter has agreed to support the delegation, of which Adly is to be president, and will, I doubt not, join it himself. When it comes to London next month we shall be in a better position to form a judgment both as to personalities and policy.April 21, 1921.
