THE GOVERNMENT AND WAGES.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.

Secret.

???

I have for some time past been increasingly concerned at the sedulously conducted campaign designed to make the Government party to an alleged determination on the part of Employers to reduce wages throughout Industry. I ask my colleagues whether the time has not now come to issue a statement on the lines of the attached memorandum.

(Intd.) T. J. M.

April 13th. 1921

Many endeavours have recently been made to convince working people that the Government and Employers of Labour generally have conspired together to reduce wages and therefore standards of comfort. The allegation is so utterly groundless, and so mischievous in its purpose, that it is desirable that a plain statement should be issued as to the Government&apos;s relations towards wage problems.

/Broadly
-   1402.Broadly, tho Government follows the roneral linos recommended by tho Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed, presided ever by the Ri^ht Hon. J * H* Whitley, !;.p., known as tho whitley committee, which reported to the Government in 1917*18,     The whole of tho rooommendations of that committoe are bacod on the asnunption that joint negotiations in each industry are the basis cf tho right policy to pursue in industrial matters.     The Committee divided industries into three groups:-(l)   Those which are highly organised.(2)   Those which are comparatively well organised.(3)   The unorganised trades.As regards the last class; an extension of the Trade Board machinery was recommended.     An regards the other classes, some form of joint negotiating machinery, such as Joint Industrial Councils, was recommended.     It was intended that theco bodice should settle industrial matters in their own industries.   Should they fail to agree, means of arbitration should, be provided j   and in the event of a serious crisis measures wore provided for sotting up a Court of Inquiry.; tho object of which was to give to Parliament and to the public generally an impartial and authoritative account of the matters in dispute./This
This policy has beer faithfully carried into of feet.   The then Minister of Labour, Mr. G*H-Roberts, M.P., informed a representative meeting of Employers and Trade Unionc on November 13th, 191P, immediately after the armistice, that the epecial measures noceBeitatod by war conditions would bo abandoned and that tho Government would expoot each industry to manage its own affairs, as far as possible, without Government interference.    This policy still obtains.   It has never been challenged, but it has boon accepted by Employers1 Associations and Trado Unions who have frequently exproosed apprehensions lent it ohould not bo followed. In particular it may be mentioned that at the   request of Mr, John Hedge, M.P., a special clause was inserted in the Industrial Courts Act 1919, which provided that the conciliation and arbitration machinoj-y of that Act could not operate until full uso had been made of existing machinery In tho trado concerned.The more important steps which tho Government has taken to carry out this policy are as follows(l)    Tho wages (Temporary Regulation) Act was pasBOd as a temporary expedient to stabilise wages during a period of nearly two yoars when in the process of demobilisation, very large bodies of men and women wore suddenly once moro available/for
142Atfor civil occupation.   During tho currency of that Act tho great majority of industries placod thoir wagon settlements on a permanent basis, and- tho.Act fully achieved its purpose. (2)      Tho Industrial Courts Art was passed at the end of 1919.     This Act lays own tho policy of the Government for dealing with industrial disputes,   it provides machinery for arbitration! including a permanent arbitration tribunal, known as tho Industrial Court, and it lays down a procedure for Courts of Inquiry. (3)      A new Trade Boards Act was passed in 1918 undor which the very small number of Trade Boards existing before the war hao been Increased to 61, and approximately 3 million workpoople aro covered by them. (4)      Joint Industrial Councils have boon cot up in 70 industries and services, covering approximately 3-J million workpeople. This policy of eetting up Joint negotiating bodies where they did not previously exist has boon abundantly justified by results.   The number of disputes leading to stoppages of work is infinitesimal in comparison with tho oases whero difforonces aro discussed by joint machinery and are settled olther by agreemont or by reference to arbitration.
143/industrialIt has always been foroseen that when* as was Inevitable, the cost of living declined and consequential effects on wages occurred^thero would be some industrial unrest.   But it was the hope of tho Government that the negotiating machinery which now exists would be able to deal with this unrest in a manner satisfactory both to employore and workpeople.   The advantage of joint discussion is that the relevant facts can be stated fully and frankly to thoao who are concerned by them, Many of tho Joint Industrial Councils are at the prosent moment under the nocossity of conaidoring reductions cf wagos.   In some case-B these discussions havo reached the point at which joint agroononts have been made.   In such cases stoppages of work have boon of rare occurrence, and tho agreements are Jointly and loyally accepted by the parties to them.   Tho Government believes that as the representatives of the Employers and Trade Unions in industry are the parties most acquainted with tho difficulties peculiar to their industry, matters of dispute should be dealt with, if possible, finally, by them.   Should it be impossible to bring about a settlement in any particular cane, the Government can assist in a neutral capacity in tho negotiations, or the parties can rofor the unsettled points to the arbitration of tho industrial Court.   In short, the provisions of tho Industrial Courts Act - an Act which has beon framed as a result of wide experience of
1446* *industrial disputes both in this and other countries -should he able to provide moans of meeting any situation which is likely to arise, where matters other than industrial questions are not broueht into the dispute.The suggestion that tho actien of the Government since January 1919 shows it to he partial and to be an active, if secret, partisan in industrial negotiations, is domonetrably untrue.So far as Trade Boards are concerned the Governments record completely refutes the suggestion that thoy havo failed to extend protection to under-paid workers.    Since tho present Government have been in office no loss than 51 Trade Boards havo been sot up covering some 3*000*000 people, men and women, as compared with some 400,000 persons covered by the Trade Boards established before that date.   These figures epaak for themselves.   It is true that latterly the Government havo proceeded with caution in the establishment of new Trade Boards, but this has been primarily in tho Interests of the workers themselves.     To cot up Trade Boardswithout fully considering their effect upon omployrrent in each-case especially in a time of grave industrial dopresoion, would be to court the riok of creating unemployment.    The Government do not admit that unemployment vvould bo caused by the oroation of Trade Boards, but they would be wanting in their duty to the workers if thoy did not examine this point with the-greatest possible care in every individual case in which the establishment of a Board is proposed.
