102(THIS DOCULE2TT IS THE SROEBETY OP HIS BRITAH1TIC IIAJSSTY&apos;S GOVEKI&amp;ENT.)SECRET.CABI33ET , Copy lieC. P. 282*.REPORT BY THE GMSRAL OPJPIGSR-CIMS^HDIXTG-IU-CHIEF OH THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WEEK MDIHG 9th APRIL, 1921.(Circulated by the Secretary cf State for War.)GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.The past week has been free from any serious outrage.In lublin there have been one or twt cases of bombs being thrown at lorries carrying Crown Forces.    Of these the most oerious attack was in Harcourt Street,   This resulted in the death of two rebel* and the wounding of one other.   One Officer was slightly wounded.In the Country the most eeuious ambush waa that near Listowel, Co. Kerry in which a cyclist patrol was attacked.   Ono rebel was killed.   An Officer was slightly wounded.The cessation cf outrage on a large scale, and the in-activity of Rebel Flying Columns has been vtry marked.    Those periodical lulls have ocourred before and it is too sarly yet to judge of the reason for the present quietness.    There are, however, indications, more especially in the Martial Law Area, that even members of Flying Columns and Active flarvioe Beetions are becoming discontented with the situation and anxious to break away.    Information has been received of the resignation of two or three rebel commandants, and it is believed that a considerable number of less prominent members are alse either severing their connection with the I.R.A. or desirous of doing so.    The fact that farms are just now suffering through the absence of their owners who are with&quot; Flying Columns or on the run may havo something to do tath the the anxiety of these men to get home for the time being.    On the other hand the continued pressure of the Crown Forces and the recent ill-success of Rebel Aotive Service Units may be having the desired effect.    The resent increase in murderH by the 1.11. A, rf so-called &quot;opnvicted spies&quot; also indicates that the lead-ing rebels are making a special effort further to impress a sense of their power upon the more luke-warm members. It is. however, unsafe to draw any conclusion yet from the present cessation of serious outrage, which may possibly be due only to a douot in the leader&apos;s minds as to how to deal with the coming Elections, and as to the relative merits from - their point of view of intimidation or temporary calm as election propaganda.\fThe Railway Situation is unchanged.   Goods from Belfast still form the objective of attack.There is a general feeling that the railwaymen in Ireland would not respond to a call to strike in aid of the Triple Alliance.- 1 -
**The destruction of roads and bridges continues, but-cren this (very safe) form of enterprise is becoming unpopular, as farmers and traders are the chief sufferers.   The,jlamage. done is frequently repaired by the local inhabitants, without any military or police encouragement.It cannot be ttd strongly emphasised that any privation which may. exist is entirely due to the action of the rebels in destroying communicatiohe by road and rail.    Such action has little effect on the Crown *orces but materially affects inhabitants, and when such is the case is used for propaganda purposes by the rebels, the onus being attributed to the Police and Military.(Signed)   C,,9,-N .MACREADY.General, Commanding-in-Chief, IKSLAUD.G.H.Q,. Ireland.12th April, 1921.
