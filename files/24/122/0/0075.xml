(THIS DOCUiEKT IS THE PHOHRTTW HIS 3HITAMIC MAJSSTYrS SOVSHBCTT). I SaGRET.&apos; CA3IHEI.CP.  875.- 0U5 AHSRIOAB DSBT AMD 3U3R0GATSD SECURITIES. Memorandum by the Cft.-.u^all or of tho Exchequer.I fear it is necessary again to draw attention to the question of &quot;SuDro^ted Securities&quot; raised in Coine-t Paper SVC5 circulated to tho Cabinet on Maroh 11th by the late Chancellor of the Exchequer.We haye now reached the stage at which the work of the National Dabt Office in releasing and returning to their owners the securities deposited by them is being dofinitely hold up owing to our inability to deal with the subrogated securities.    Hot only does this involve a direot addition to the expenditure of the Ex-chequer in the shape of tho extra ^5 interest paid on deposited securities, but there is waste on staff temporarily unemployed and a prospeot of hoavy overtime and serious physical difficulty in returning all the securities by the 31st Maroh 1922, if the work is held up for any long time now.   In tha3e circumstances I should like to suggest that tho British Ambassador in WashiJsgfcon should be asked to request the immediate release of the subrogatod securities in-dependently of a settlement of the general question of conversion of our demand notes into long-term bonds.   We could assure the United States Treasury that our promise to pay will be equally binding with-out this specific security for a small part of tho whole.I do not think it is altogether unlikely that such sv request would be agreed to, and I do not see that we can do any harm to our position by making tho request.    The delay in beginning dis-cussion on the general question is after all mainly due to\the exigencies of the internal situation of the United States Government,(Intd.) R,H.Treasury Chambers. 26th April, 1921.
