DOCUMENT 13, THE PROPERTY 01&apos;&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * 3 G0Y3RN1I3NT).PENT I AX. CABINET.DRAFT OF STATEMENT BY THE PRIMS MINISTER TO THE NATION FOR PUBLICATION IN THE&apos;&quot; SUNDAY PAPERl.      &apos;.(Reference Conferenoe of Ministers held on Friday, April 8th, 1921, at 3*30 p4m* ..For many years past the extremists of the Labour ttove-ment in foreign countries have dreamed and preaohed a plan: for coercing Governments by the weapon of a general strike. Attempts have boon made abroad to put that plan into execution, but always without succes3tToday, for the first time, attempt is being made toooeroe tho British Government and people by these means   ,by withholding from British industry supplies o$ coal and railway service and so depriving us of the means of heat,-allight, steam power, electric/power and transport,on which every industry in the country depends, and thus producing national paralysis.Tho effect of a strike of this kind,, if successful, would bo gradually to close every factory and workshop in tho country; to throw all othor workers out of employment, to prevent the distribution of food and other neoessaries of life, and so to coerce Parliament and the nation into granting the demands of the coal-minors,- out of whichthe present situation&apos; has arisen.-It is, therefore, absolutely vital that every man and woman should understand what thafee demands are and wliat they mean,,    The country must understand the issues which have to bo faced0Parliament has decided that War-time control of the    -* mines must now cease, and that the already over-burdened taxpayer cannot be asked to pay subsidies to the coal industrial which would mean heavier burdensand consequently lower wages in overy other industry in the oountry.   The aim of the
Minersr Federation is to force Parliament to reverse the -decision and to extort a subsidy. ;,-To this end they have struck at the very safety and existence&apos;of the&apos;nines,.threatening to destroy their-own.moans cf livelihood and resources vital to every industry and every home in the land.Day by day - fresh mines ere being flooded and already . irreparable damage has been dono.Such a claim backed by ouch action cannot fail to injure the workers in other industries.Do not believe tho story put about that tho Government and employers are parties to some groat conspiracy to lower wages.    It is not true.    No more wicked or groundless state-ment could bo made.While the cost of living due to the war was rising, the Government again and again assisted the workers to.obtain increases of wagos.     Since the cost of living has fallen, it is, of course, true that there have been wage reductions* -Some of these are on mutually and pre-arranged sliding scales depending either upon the index figure representing the cost of living or upon tho selling prices of products.    Some again have been negotiated between employers and employed sitting together as members of Joint Industrial Councils or otherwise.. -;. &apos;- &quot;&apos; &apos;-So.-far.from endeavouring to reduce wages, the Government, in fact,..-by tho v.&apos;ages&apos; (Trades Regulation) Act did much to , stabilise- wages during the difficult period after hostilities when millions of men and women were returning to industrial occupation after they were demobilised from Har Service and work...o
Apart from this exceptional Act passed wholly in the interests of the workers, the Government has scrupulously refrained from interfering in industrial wage questions, otherwise than/providing; full means of arbitration and conciliation for the settlement of disputes.&apos;In this national emergency there is urgent need for the services of all men of goodwill.     Volunteers will be needed to ensure the distribution of milk and other foodstuffs by road to all parts of the Kingdom and to all classes - strikers and non-Strikers alike.Volunteers will be wanted to save the mines from ruin.     If this is not done the end of the strike will leave a ruined ooal industry, and a ruined coal industry means ruin in all ether industries,     Volunteers will be wanted to maintain law and order and to protect public and municipal services essential to the life of the community,, and to protect peaceable citizens   from acts of intimidation and violence.I appeal to every man and woman who believes in democratic institutions to support the t^wyernhdht in resist/this threat against the People and to give their services unstintingly to the State in the task of maintaining public order and enabling the Conmiiaity to carry on its daily duties. &apos;2 -Whitehall Gardens, S.A7.1&apos;..
