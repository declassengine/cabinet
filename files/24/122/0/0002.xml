THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP KIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT: PRINTED FOR THE CABINETAPRIL. 1921.SecretCP. 2802. CABINET,PROVISION OP BRITISH PREVENTIVE POLICE FOR RHINSLAND CUSTOMS CONTROL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire.The number of men required for this purpose (i.e. to form control posts to assist the British customs officers who will supervise the technical German customs personnel to he established on the new customs frontier between the British zone of occupation and unoccupied Germany) has been carefully examined.    The minimum estimate now put forward by the British High Commissioner is 150, inclusive of those employed on railway control.    Their duties will he to conduct persons wishing to cross xhe frontier to the customs houses, and to arrest all persons who try to evade the customs by crossing the frontier without reporting to the customs posts,2,    The Commander-in-Chief of the Rhine arny being unable to supply this number of troops from the forces now at his disposal, the British High Commissioner recommends that they should be recruited in Englandat
at once as a special preventive police, force.    If the customs sanction is to last for any time the British staff will require to he supplemented, and perhaps can eventually be partially replaced by auxiliary German staff recruited on the spot.   But it is considered impossible to inaugurate the customs with German frontier guards alone,3.    I therefore suggest, since the alternative of allowing the control posts to be formed by French troops is highly undesirable, that tho War Office should be authorised to undertake the enlistment and organisation of the 150 men required without delay, and to arrange for their early despatch to Cologne, in consultation with the Foreign Office as to details.40    The rates of pay should be on the same scale as that given to corresponding grades in the British Depart-ment of the Inter-allied Rhineland High Commission. Assuming that the number of these officials is to be 150, the monthly cost to be advanced will be about  4,000. This amount might ultimately be recovered from the customs takings, ,but in the meantime Treasury sanction to pay the necessary salaries will be required.5. The officers sent out by the War Office and Customs (Lt-Col. Haining and Mr. Avis on respectively) are understood to concur in these recommendations.C. of K.t ^ Od^l ,g at
