&apos; -   110BfHIS DOCUMSHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS G0VERM3NT) gOHET. 0 A B I K E g.3.P. 2829* VTHE IRISH ELECTIONS ANB AN OFFER OF A TRUCE. Memorandum by Dr, Addlscn.At the Meeting of. the Cabinet on Maroh 24 (cabinet 15(21), Conclusion 1), it was decided that the following quostions should bo considered after the Easter adjournment, namely:-The deairability ... (a) of announcing a trooo to take effeotduring the period of the elections, and(bj the offer of a truoe for negotiations beforo the election. It has not been possible, hitherto, to resume the consideration of these subjects owing to the intervention of the industrial orisis, but I hope that this may be done at an early date in view of th* approaoh of the elections in Ireland.There are two questions into!\A(1) the offer of a trroe sma (L) tfce u$jilic&amp;tJ,o&amp; of the period of the truoe, if obtained, for the reckoning of negotiations.1*   The Offer of a Truce. It cannot. I think be denied that we are confronted by a Bpirit of hostility on tho part of the Irish people outside parts of Ulster which involves, numbers of ,the Irish people who, nevertheless, hate murders and attiocitf&amp;3..n of all kinds and deplore the unfortunate state of their country.    These people are I fear persistently, and increasingly unfriendly to us, so that we are becoming confronted with a really national antagonism on tho part of the Irish people.    It is this feature of the situation-1- which.......
Illwhioh seems to mo to be of even more - slfnifieanos^-than -the oontinued oommittal of outrages.    It was a spirit of this kind that tho Austrians aroused in Italy, eventually to their undoing, and it is because I camct but tUink that the same thing is going on in Ireland, that the question of the offer of a truoe at this time is of special importance.A truce would, I suppose, in general terms involve a complete suspension on the part of the Sinn vein Forces and agents, of murders, raids, outrages, and attacks of all kinds, and a complete suspension on the part of the Govern-ment, of arrests, raids, searohes and trials of persons accused of offences oommittod in furtherance of the &amp;im Fein campaign, as distinct from the administration of the ordinary law.    The terms I havo mentioned make no pretence of being a preoiso definition of the terms of any proposed trues. Suoh terms v/ould require careful definition, but it is clear that no offer of a truoe would be worth the making unless it were frank and generous In its terms, and unaccompanied by harassing or ambiguous restrictions.Would it bo worth while to offer such a truoe?   I think it would.    No one can now aoouse the Government of lack of sincerity In seeking to give effect to the Government of Ireland Aot, or of firmness in dealing with the repression of crime, and in these circumstances it seems to me that only those who refuse suoh an offer would lose credit by their refusal.   It would certainly strengthen in their allegianoe to the Government those of their supporters in the country who entertain serious misgivings as to the wisdom of the methods that we are pursuing in Ireland.   I am afraid that there is a large number of people who generally wish to &apos;. support.!..&apos;.
&quot;... 112support the Government, who are at present In this frame of mind. Such an offer might also have a useful effeot in Ireland in bringing inti greater prominence the importance of the Government of Ireland A6t, and the opportunity that it affords for real self-government.   Should such a truce be obtained it would not only give an opportunity for holding the eleet*i*ns under more quiet and practical conditions, but it might well afford an opportunity Jfor the rallying and oonsolidation of those influ-ences which make for more lasting settlement, and make more difficult the restarting of a campaign of outrage.    I therefore think that an offer of a truce should be made.Z.   The re^onnaing of negotiations.Tho next question whloh it was decided to discuss was:-&quot;The offor of a truoe for negotiatiens before the electIens&quot;.Should a truce be obtained there will no doulit to efforts made by persons of good will to promote negotiations even if no announcement on the subject is made at the time when the truoe Is arrange!.    It might well be that public roferenoe to negotiations at that time would lead to tha formu-lation of terms or conditions affecting negotiations whioh would tend to make the settlement of a truco more diffioult.   on the whole I am inolined to think that the right course to take would-be to endeavour to promote a truco, and during the peri&apos;od\ of the\truce to sedk to obtain a oonferenoe with authoritative Sinn Fein leaders.The basis for such a conference, if it could he brought about, might be an undertaking on the part of the Sinn freinors peaceably to eleot members to, and to work the south Irish Parliament along with the Forth, under the terms of the Government of Ireland Aot, on the condition that the British Governmentpieces....
113pledges itself to introduce and to pass through parliament an Act to confer fisoal autonomy on Ireland.   I think that the question of financial contribution on either side should be left open for discussion at the Conference,   in this connection it is well to remember that our military and additional police expenditure in Ireland amounts to over  30,000*000 per annum, and that any settlement relieving us of this expenditure, and of the embarrassmont which, as we aro finding to our cost at this moment, is thereby entailed, would be worth even a consider-able sacrifice in the contribution from Ireland as anticipated under the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act.(Sgd.)
