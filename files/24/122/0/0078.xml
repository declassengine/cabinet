fttlfoie of French Proposalg prepared bv      DerthelofcThe object of the occupation of the Ruhr is to make Germany&apos; pay. i.e. to obtain net new paper but (1) an immediate pnyment *f importance, and (2) the necessary guarantees for eventual effective pay ents.(a) Occupation,, Military Oontentration (10 days) mobil isation of one olaso.   Execution of the operation (3 days) with 7 Divisions,   The occupation to be roftde with See en aa its centre. The mines and factories will be provided with controllers oapablo of blooming dir^ctaps.Ae feeding of the population has been carefully prepared,(b) Coal Production.   The production amounts to 7$ million tons (1 million consumed by the German mines in the    , Ruhr, 2 millions cent to the Allies, 2 millions consumed by the Ruhr factories, 2^ millions export-ed to unoccupied Germany and to neutrals).Thin order of deliveries will continue to be obB^rved.(i).(c) Means of Payment,(1) Tax on coal consumed in the Ruhr or despatched to the left bark to be collected by the Coal Syndicate under Allied control and paid to the Reparation Account:   ?J gold marks per ton.(2) Tax on coal despatched into unoccupied Germany: 20 gold marks per ton.(?) Coal d^llver**d to the Allies will be free from the tax,(/)) &apos;Th* Customs posts will only allow coal exports accompanied by a ^alsser passer from the Allied representative on the Coal Syndicate indicating that the tax has been paid.(d) General Exports from the Ruhr.(1) All goods leaving the D.uhr will be accompanied by an Allied certificate indicating that the total price thereof has been paid to a bank under Allied control.(2) 59 per cent, of the money thus collected will be paid to the Reparation Commission. The remainder will&apos;be paid to the Allied Commission of the Ruhl to pay for imports.(e) Customs Regime,   The Customs cordon surrounding the Ruhr on the German side will collect upon entry the sarre tariff as in the Rhineland, i.e. 25 per cent. 0* the present German tariff payable in gold.- **OCCUPATION OF THE RUHR.
Imports from the Rhine land irrt^the Ruhr will only pay the actual Ittiinelajid-*o--G^^     exp^rt-^r-rfr: i.e., the present a?rman tariff in paper marks.Ulti ate exports fror.. the Ruhr into Germany would pay the total Gem an tariff in foreign bills paid to the Reparption Account.Ruhr factories will b* devoted to the utmost possible extent to the produetier of raw materials and materials for the devastated regions (in particular, rails).(II).GENERAL PROQflDURP, J?*R REPARATIONS. -Means of Pay went.(1) The Gerrran Oustorcs to be collected for the profit of the Entente and to be controlled b;, the Allies. Germany to collect her. Customs Duties in gold as is the practice with many countries.   Her Customs tariff might well produce 1 milliard gold marks a year.(2) An Allied Commission to be established at Kssen with control of the coal exports    v passing through the Ruhr Valley stations,6n every ton of coal produced a payment of 40 gold roa&amp;ks to be made to the Allies by the Coal Conmis-sion.   &quot;Ms is not exactly a tax on coal, but it is Intended to compel Germany to pay according as a source of riches is created of which rhe will be deprived if she does not acquit herself of her undertakings.   This payment would represent 3 to 4 irilliards of gold narks a years   to pay it Germany must herself raise the corresponding bills.The same payment will be demanded on all coal iirportad into Germany and on the production of the other German mines. A payment of 8 gold marks a ton will be levied on lignite,Qontrol tjfflce for Foreign Secutlries.A general Expert and Import Office (which existed in Germany during the flar) will be set up.   Export Licences will be delivered against the delivery of . the whole of the corresponding foreign bills.   A corresponding payment in paper marks will be made by the German Govern ent to the German exporters.Imports into G*nr;ary will also be dependent upon licensed-c*s, and the Ofioe will deliver to the importers the necessary foreign bills In payment,*A policy of restriction-must be followed in Germany in order that the bank of the Office may pcssen3 an excess of foreign bill, 25 per c*nt- of the whole of the bill  (?) produced froir imports being seized by the Allied Commission of Control.   This levy will . raise some 3 to 4 milliards&apos; of gold marks a year. It is the application of Mr Lloyd George&apos;s system.
- &apos; 405*t    4t    ftTransition ggrj^j,A transition period must be expected, for during the first years Geraany will not dispose of a sufficient number of foreign bills to pay at once the coal and customs levy and th&quot; lew on the bills of the Irport and rxp0rt Office.It is possible that G^rrany &quot;-ill have to issue a loan each year on foreign markets, and one of the guarantees specified above, for example, the Customs under Allied control might be taken.It will be necessary first to arrange the question of the 12 milliards of gold marks which Germany owes, and in respect of which the Reparation Commission hr.s declared her default. In respect of this payment Germany must immediately pay the whole of the Reichsba-k gold (1290 millions of marks, i.e., 1 per cent, of th* German fiduciary circulation .   The &quot;non^ntlon ^iducialre&quot;,being so weak,has no farther impert-an^e.In respect of the regaining 11 milliards th^ Allies must accept for 7 milliards a 30 percent cent, share in German busi-ness in the forrr: of ordinary shares (by reducing the capital by 30 p*?r cent, and creating new shares corresponding to this reduction which will op paid to the Allies).Germany will alleviate h^r financial situation by a simui taneous reduction of her internal loan, Treasury Bonds and paper marks, and there will thus be effected a real levy on the florfcane o^ Germany indispensable i* she is to meet her obligations.The remainder of the 11 milliards will be obtained by the internal requisition of th- shares possessed by German nationals abroad, and of the foreign securities&apos;still held in Germany.   This amounts to souse 4 milliards of marks. The German financial system is sufficiently scrupulous to enable Germany to know where these shares are,materials for toe tctastatpd itppitits.y*     i&apos;Tonallytt the supply of materials for the reconstruction of thp- devastated regions will be deducted from the annuities to b* paid by G-many.   The French Government has studied . the exact organisations of this flatter,(I).It is of cours? understood that the complete and entire disarmament of Germany will b* carried out under the control o^ the Allies.
