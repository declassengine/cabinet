201Committee of Home Affairs(THIS DOCUI\IF;&quot;T IS TtTL PROPERTY OF HI&quot; BR IT ATTIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.C A B I N EJT.CP. 2847.allqtmt:;:ts^ in i king [ s j^iik,a ediijtburgh.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of rorks*p, Y;ith reference to the Secretary for Scotland&apos;s Memorandum *regarding allotments in King/s Park, Edinburgh, I give the following details of the conditions under which these allotments were granted end the reasons why I do not consider thet they should be allowed to remain indefinitely.Tn 1917 it was decided as a war measure, and in view of the food shortage, to grant land in the Royal Parks for use as allotments. Some 17 acres in King&apos;s Park, Edinburgh, were accordingly allotted to the Edinburgh Corporation for this purpose, subject to two months&apos; notice for surrender on December 51st of any yearnIn June 1919, notice was given that possession of the ground would be resumed from the end of February 1920, but at the request of the Corporation, an extension was granted until February 1921. In november 1919, another extension until February 1922 was given, and this time on the distinct understanding that no further cencession would be made.I have always, maintained that the -rant of these portions of the Royal Parks for allotments was to meet a special war emergency, and that the ground should revert to its normal use as soon as possible, in view of the tendency for holders of&apos; such concessions to obtain vested interests in what is really a national possession As Custodian of the Royal Parks, I am bound to administer them in the interests of the general public as a whole.     The use of special portions by individuals must be regarded as altogether exceptional. The Parks are maintained out of Imperial Funds and it is impossible to defend the continued alienation of portions of ground for the benefit of a comparatively few local residents.
202The allotments in tho London Parks under my control have now all beer] surrendered in spits of considerable agitation, and if the suggestion of the Secretary for Scotland be adopted it is more than probable that the dispossessed allotment holders in. London would put in     do-in for similar facilities, --hlch I should find it difficult to resist.    As a matter of fact attention has already been drawn in the Press to the preferential treatment accorded to the Holyrood allotment holders as compared with those in the London Parks.   It is admitted that the necessity for resumption is not equally great in all the Parks, and the allotments in Richmond Park and Holyrood can hardly be said to interfere with the public use to the same extent as those in the Central London Parks, but the ectual circum-stancos vary so generally that the same policy should be adopted in r-.&quot; ard to all the i:arks concerned.     In this connection it should be stated that all the allotments in the London County Council Parks have flreodv been surrendered, while the Edinburgh Corporation are also asking for the surrender of those in the Parks under their control.Though it is true that objections to the allotments at Holy-rood have not been raised by the Edinburgh public, it is inevitable that protests would be received when once it became known that they were to continue indefinitely.     I have already been asked by Question in the House of Commons when they will be surrendered.   I desire to meet the Secretary for Scotland as far as possible;   but the utmost I am prepared to recommend is o further extension of one year from the end of February 1922, and that it be clearly laid down and cyreed that, under no circumstances, will the Government permit the retention of allotments in the Fing&apos;s Park beyond the end. of February 1923.     I understand from the Member for Central Edinburgh that the representatives of the allotment holders are prepared to accept this condition.   If it is decided to recommend this or any
other concession, it will be necessary for me to submit the proposals to The -;-ing, by whose pleasure tho grant wag originslly made.(Intd.) C. and B.H.M. Office of Works, 19th April, 1921.
