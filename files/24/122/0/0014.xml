L, W. E,9th April.The \7ar Office, Whitehall,London, S,W,1,9th April, 1931,1,       The establishments at Woolwich that are directly affected by the present question of the discharge of -ex-service men ore twelve in number,   consisting of the Ordnance Factories, the Royal Army Ordnance Department, /five Inspection, Research and Experimental Establishments, two Army Record Offices, one Army Pay Office and two Admiralty      \&quot;,&apos; establishments.   Of these the Ordnance Factories is the largest organisation.   The following table shows the numbers of employees at these establishments before the war, at the time of the Armistice, and now (Admiralty establishments omitted )* Distribution of present employees Pre-war.

These have prior claims.2, Early in 1920, when the Factories were still underthe Ministry of Munitions, special arrangements were made by that ministry with the approval of the Prime Minister providing that, apart from pre-war hands,\ ex-service men would be the last tobe discharged&quot;and,*in&quot;&quot;&apos;effect,&quot;&quot;that none would be discharged

An Independent Advisory Committee responsible to the Prime Minister was set up to deal with cases is dispute between the local oficials and the specially appointed body representing the ex-service nen. (see announcements by Deputy Minister of ifunitions in The House of Commons on 12th February, 2nd March and 17th March, 1920, -Columns 244,, 273 and 2222 of Hansard of those dates).3. This Independent Advisory Committee did not operate for long, and in July 1920 there was set up in its place, but under the Financial Secretary of the War Office, a body - known as the Woolwich Secretariat for the Substitution of Hx-Service men - to act as a Clearing House on the question of ex-service men&apos;s employment and as a Committee to investigate the possibilities of substitution.49 As all the other organisations were constantlyreducing their work the only practical avenue of absorption has been the Ordnance Factories,   The position now rt-ached in those Factories is that not only are there practically no vacancies for surplus men from other establishments but the Factories themselves are finding it increasingly difficult to provide work for their own ex-service men.5. - There is no justification whatever either fromthe financial point of view or the actual requirements of Government Departments for the staff of the Factories to exceed the pre-war figure of 10,866 but at the moment (as shown above) the numbers are actually about 3,900 in excess, and in the present state of the business of the country it is practically impossible to find additional work for them.   It would obviously be unjustifiable to take on additional hands.6. Not only has every possible endeavour been madeinside all the organisations to replace the civilian element by ex-service men but in addition some 500 ex-service men have been&apos;found employment in the Factories during the last 12 months by the Secretariat, on transfer from other establishments,7. The time has, however, arrived when suchtransfers can no longer be effected..  As indicated in a Memorandum sent to the Prime Minister on the 6th instant, the number of immediately rodunant- ex-service men is now about 2,000 (redundant at establishments other than the Factories) and there is no War Department organisation at Woolwich in which they can be found employment. It will probably be urged by the Ex-service men&apos;s representatives that at present the Factories are carrying (l) a number of civilian ,F/ar entrants   and (2) a number of non-ex-service men temporarily employed under the short time scheme.     Director General of Ea-ctories satisfied that except in possibly a few isolated cases further I displacements cannot bo effected if any efficiency of work is to be preserved.8. It would appear therefore that there is no satisfactory alternative to proceeding with the discharge of the2t 000
2,000 redundant radn.   If this is approved, a weekly discharge of 200 is as small a rate as can reasonably he expected.   Including necessary notices, it v/ill mean retaining men for whom no ;ork is available up to a maximum period of three months.   Included in the 2tO00 there are about 400 clerks, and, subject to the concurrence of the Treasury and x&amp;nistry of Labour, it is thought that these clerks might be reported to the Joint Substitution hoard set up by the Government upon the recommendation of Lord Lyttonfs Committee to deal with the possible re-employment of ex-sorvice clsrks redundant in Government Departments.   This might sightly relieve the Woolwich situation, though it is doubtful whither the Board referred to could find many posts suitable for those ex-Woolwich men.9. No provision has bean made in the &apos;7ar Officeestimates for the retention of these surplus wen.   If their discharges are postponed the cost should be charged to some unemployment vote*
