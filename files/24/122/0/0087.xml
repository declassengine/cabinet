VERBATIM   REPORT ofCONFERENCEof Government representatives, and tho Executive Committee of the Miners1 federation held at the Conference Room. Board of Trade, 4 p.m, April 28th.1921.tThe Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Chair,Board of Trade, 28th,April, 1921,
TH3 CHANCELLOR OF TH3 EXCHEQUER:     The Government is prepared to come to the assistance of the mining industry at the present time with a grant of  10,000,000. We propose that in the month of May no greater reduction should take place in the wage of the miner in any district than 3/- a shift and in the month of June no greater reduction should take place than 3/6d, a shift. The remainder of the sum of  10,000,000 to.which I have referred should thereafter be divided between, the months of July and August, two-thirds in the month of July and one-third in the month of August.    The money supplied by the Government will in each of those months go to Increase the wages in the districts which require it, where the district wage is not sufficient to meet the point of reduction.How I come to a point which lies in your option. So far as the Governments proposal is concerned, a uniform reduction of wages over the whole country is not neoessari-ly involved.   A distriot which can pay a higher wage would still be entitled to pay it.    For example, a 3/-reduction in wages would not be necessitated by the stateof
of trade in a 7027 few districts in the country, for example South Yorkshire, Leicestershire, and, I think, Notts and Derby;   I give these merely as examples.   But if you choose yourselves to have a uniform reduction in wages then tho Government is willing to facilitate the operation of your desire in that matter    It must not, however, be regarded as any necessary part of the Government&apos;s proposal;   it remains entirely with you to decide.   If you resolve to have a uniform reduction, then it is plain that in some districts at least, the miner would be tailing less wages than the mine-owner&apos;Is willing to give him.  Accordingly, since the Government is affording a subvention of its own to the mining industry we should be willing, and we have got tho assent of the coal-cwners to this proposal, to collect the wage which the miner wa3 thus being deprived of in districts where he was entitled to more,and
issue/and use it as part of the assistance to be given to the districts which are nore hardly hit.   But that is for you to determine. This suggestion, of course, can only apply to the period when we are giving assistance, namely the months of May, June, July and Augustj and if you yourselves desired to continue such a system, it would be, I think, not impossible in the interval for you to devise mechanism by which you could do it; but that is entirely a matter for the Miners1 Federation.Now this proposal is in no respect a suggestion for a temporary settlement.   The Government is only making these pro-posals on the footing that a durable settlement is going to be made.   When I speak of a durable settlement I mean something that would last at least a year from the end of the transition period; that is to say, from the end of August, as I have sketched it.   It would last for at least a year, and would thereafter be terminable upon three months1 motioe, - that is, it would not be terminable on three months&apos; notice until after the termination of the year ending 21st August, 1922.I know that various issues have been raised of a oontrover-sial character.     The main subject of contention has been the question of a national pooling of profits.   I use that t^rra without any definition, because definition would require a very great deal of elucidation and explanation; but I mean a system of national pooling of profits in the way which has been described in the various doouments which have been issued by the miners  Federation.     How we regard that issue as really a political
issue, upon which, as a Government, we had to make up our minds % It would, in the circumstances, have involved legislation, because It v/as apparant that no voluntary agreement could be arrived at.    We are not prepared to Introduce legislation for this purpose.    Even if we believed that such a scheme could be subeessful and permanently useful to the industry - whioh we do not believe, - we do not think it would be possible to carry it into effect at the present time, and under present conditionsf Our view upon that matter is quite clear,    Wo may be right, or we may be wrong;   and in a political election the people of the oountry might think we were wrong or might think we were right. In any case, that is our view;   and we oan only act according to the best of our judgment.This, as I take it, in your own view would involve distriot settlements, for the reason that a national level of wage would Involve the putting out of action of a large number of pitsf On the other hand, a district adjustment of wage would keep more pits in being than would otherwise be the case.    Even under a district settlement it is probable that in bad times such as the present not all pits oan be kept in operation.    2he justification of the national pool was the fixing of wages on some uniform national basis. ,We are driven, therefore, under these circumstances, if we wish to keep the largest possible number of pits in operation, to systems of district settlements.    What the precise districts are to be is a matter for adjustment between the Miners1 IPederatiori and the Mining Association.    The view of the Government Is that these distriots should be adjusted by a National Board composed equally Qf representatives of the coalowners and of the miners./I have
I have mentioned a JUtional Board.   I should like to reiterate what I think is already known to be the view of the Government - that it is of great importance that the efficacy of the Miners1 Federation as a national institution should be in no way impaired.   A National Board acting on behalf both of the coalownor3 and of the minors coems to tho Government to be a necessity of the situation, and we believe that ovon under a system by which wages may be settled in districts according to the capacity of the district to pay, tho National Board would perform very great and important functions.
It ought to determine in our view the principles upon which wages are adjusted in the districts; and in any case in whioh complaint might arise that these principles wore not being followed an appeal to tho National Board would he competent.Looking to the mining history in this country, this plan does not Seem to mo to ho inconsistent with what has hitherto ocourrod.   Wages before the war were determined upon district lines, and the district 3cale is still the basis of the wage in every part of the country.   As I understand the view of the Miners&apos;Federation, it is not sought to disturb that distriot basis, and accordingly I- do not think that the adherence to the district methods of settloment, combined with the exercise of important functions of judgment, and appeal by the National Board, is in any way inconsistent with the whole theory upon which the organisation of the Miners1 Federation has been built up, nor do I think that it will prove to be in any way inefficacious for the purpose which they desire.There are two other Questions which remain:   One is the issue as to the ratio of profits to wages in dealing with the proceeds of the industry.   Before I say anything about that I should like to make a remark with regard to a matter very little appreciated by the people of this country at the present time.   The proposals which have been put forward for the adjustment of remuneration in the mining industry, alike by tho miners and by the mine owners, is the greatest advance in industrial matters whioh I know of in any industry, either in this country or in any other oountry.   It is a more completeschomo/
8.440scheme of profit-sharing than any :vith which I am acquainted, and before I say anything further I should like to congratulate the Miners1 federation and the Mining Association uoon the -Treat achievement which in this direction they have already arrived aty     But they are still in issue with regard to the ratio of profits to wases. The gap between them is not large and in some respects, at some times at least, the proposals of the Miners&apos; Federation would be more favourable to the owners than their own proposals.    At other times, of course, it would not be so, I desire to say uuon this matter that if a satisfactory conclusion to both parties cannot be arrived at by mutual agreement this seems to me to be a question which is eminently susceptible of decision by a reference to some person or persons in whom both sides would have confidence.The other question to which I referred is that of the standard wage.     I have had a talk with both parties separately u^on this matter.     I am not yet convinced that some more conversations between the parties might not have a favourable result.     But if I am wrong in this, I should judge it to be also a question which might be determined by some independent person or persons in whom both parties have confidence.I think I have dealt with all the matters which at the moment require consideration.     I venture to repeat that the Government could not advise the House of Commons to grant this considerable sum of money at a time when the country is very seriously depressed, when other industries are undergoing very severe trial, except uTon the absolute and irrevocable condition that a continuing settlement in the sense which I have described is arrived at./Mr.. - Frank Hodges;
MR,FBANK HODGES?   Full, Sir I.obert. we have listened to what has been described as tho final terms of the Government,   T/q have laid bare the whole of our argument for the change that wo have proposed on the separate issues that are before us.   We have laid before you very carefully our statement on the National TTages Board and the National Pool.   Wg have waited for that statement to bo effectively controverted, either by the owners or by the Government, and wo have waited in vain.   We were prepared to meet some hostility from both to that proposition, but we were net prepared to accept hostility unless it was based upon arguments. We feel, after all. that the owners have said and all that you yourself said, that the opposition to this proposal is based to somo extent upon conservatism -I will not say prejudice - upon a reluctance to accept a new idea which has been put forward by us, not for any political motive whatsoever.   There may be those who might have conceived this stop or this proposal as leading in the direotion of some cherished goal, such as nationalisation, but for those of us as an Executive Committee and our districts who have propounded this idea, we have propounded it exclusively and entirely in the interest of the trade itself (Hear,hear), ITor we want peace in our trade; wo want a long period of peace and prosperity.   We want happiness for our people and our children.   We do not want constantlyrecurring strikes which keep our people on the poverty line.   Fe want them to be well off; we want them to enjoy good conditions of life while they are here, and for that we must have peace,   Fe can conceive of no other means by whioh there can be effective and lasting peace inthe/
the trade.   If the Government had told us how, within our own corporation as miners and mineowners, we could have devised a plan which would have given us permanent peace, we would not have clung with any unnecessary bias or any speoial prodeliction to our own proposals    We did not put that proposal forward as the last word for the good governance of this industry, but in the absence of any other proposal that commends itself to uSt we feel that, come what may, there is not likely tc be a long period of peace in the industry i
litWe will not in reply to your very clear statement, re-state our arguments for the National ,wages Board and the National Pool, but I would say in reply to one point that you made, that is is in keeping with the structure of the Miners1 federation of Great Britain that it should seek the unification, financial and otherwise, of tho mining industry. It is anomalous that a groat national organisation should exist, powerful and influential as it is, and yet see perpetuated year after year these great distriot anomalies.Now with regard to the standard wage, the standard wage that we proposed was a wage which we had hoped to secure as a minimum wage whioh would have raised directly and simultaneously all our distriot standards up to a new and modernised standard.   We go back to the year 1879, and we go back to 1888, and we go down again to the years 1911 and 1915 we have standards of all ages, and we had hoped to have modernised them and brought them up to date, and to have embodied in them some of the advantages that we had gained since the year 1879.   It is true that between the owners&apos; proposal for a standard and our own there was a gap, a fairly large gap, but that gap could have been bridged if the owners had approached the subject in the same spirit as we approached it, or if the Government had set aside the owners&apos; prejudices and had said it is right and proper that these old anomalies should be wiped out, and just a3 other organisations have secured modern standards so the Miners&apos; Federation should have modern standards.With regard to the ratio of profits to wages, I an going to agree with you that it Is the most far-reaching proposal that has been made in modern industry.   Had it not been for the fact that it was related to districts insteadof
of related to the national trade that proposal in itself would have removed from our mon-s minds much of the suspicion, &quot;doubt, and irritation that exists now, for whatever happens in the future we should know to a penny how much profits the trade was going to give up and how much wages the workmen were going to receive.    Both parties would have concentrated upon reducing the costs of production to the lowest possible point;   they would have had something to stimulate them to the greatest possible efficiency so as to have had the largest possible balance between cost and price for division between the parties.     It would have worked automatically;   we would have had no strikes and stoppages about it;   the revenue and income and expenditure would have been ascertained quarter by quarter, and tho national trade would have moved on for many years to come in an atmosphere of complete quietness and, I think, prosperity.
I think prosperity would have &quot;been bound to have followed in the trade on such an arrangement as that.     It is true that the owners, when they proposed their 1% as their minimum standard profit related to our minimum wage, and when they proposed 80$ as their share of profits after the minimum in both cases had been reached, were asking for a rate of profit which was unparalleled in the history of the trade.    They...would havo had under their proposal a profit which would run* * * *them into anything between  35,0003000 and  38,000,000 per annum if our wages of September last oould have been regarded as the wage for a number of years to come.   That was too much.    But on that point I think both the owners and ourselves were prepared that that should go to the judgment of an outside authority.    We were both prepared because, as you must know, Sir Robert,  1,000,000 profit is only a penny a day of wages, and therefore we would not have continued this dispute if it was a quostion between the owners getting a certain number of millions above what we thought they were entitled to, because we were quite sure that having submitted these points to a competent authority outside we could have got a decision satisfactory to both parties,   On the question of wages, which is a question you introduced first but with which I am dealing last, you/were
andwere making a proposition to us for a 3/- a day reduction which we cannot stande   Justice demands that we should have a lesser reduction.   It is the unfortunate circumstances in which we are placed by having no money in our trade to pay a better rate of wages which compels us to cciae to the Government for assistance.   We came to the Government for assistance believing that we were coming to an authority that ought to give us assistance, not that we want to place ourselves in relation to the Government in any different position from any other trade;   wo do not.   We only ask the Government to give back o share, and a very small share, of what the trade has given the nation.   If the Government had not taken the false step it did take in decontrolling the trade on a falling market, we should r.o. bt+ro been in this position.   It mould have beon infinitely better for us to have had decontrol a year ago when the trade was on an upward market than to have had it at this critical period.   We cannot stand the reduction that is proposed.   It brings us below the cost of living to a considerable point.   We have made it clear to you that on the wages question, if you had proposed a reduction in wages which had kept us at or about the oost of living level, we should have acceptod that reduction,
and any subsequent reduction that would follow the drop in the oost of living if at that moment the Government were still subsidising us.   Because, as I stated this morning, it would be unfair for the workmen to be receiving subsidies from the Govern-ment which were related to anything alse except the cost of living.   The Governments attitude is an attitude, I understand, of trying to soften down the blow for us.   Well, if in the next month or two it were discovered that nationally the cost of living had gone dowrn and that the industry were still unable to pay us the wages of the present moment, or pay us   an amount equal to what the Government had been oontributing, we would have said it is right and proper for the Government to make an application that, in so far as the cost of living has gone down, they should be relieved of their financial obligations to the exact degree it has gone down.    A 3s, reduction for the first month is too much. The possibility of a 3s.6d. reduction in the second month, with no prospect of the cost of living falling, is a still greater hardship to bear.     The possibility of 4s. in the month of July and 4s.6d. in the month of August is more than we oan agree to, and, in your hearts, I think must be more than you oan feel we ought to agree to.    Having said that just in that simple form, I have only to say now that we shall report very fully to our Conference - we shall be glad to have the shorthand-notes of what you have said      and communicate to you any deoision arrived at there.THE CHANCELLOR OS1 THE EXCHEQUER:   I have listened with very great attention to what Mr Hodges has said.   I am not un-aware of the great difficulties in which the mining industry finds itself to-day, and I do not fail to appreciate those difficulties.   !Dr Maonamara, who is on my left   the Minister of Labour   knows equally well the great straits in which most of the industries of the country are at the prasent time; and he knows from the figures of the unemployed with which he has to deal how bitter the lot of many people is.   We all regret these things/
/Believe16 othings.    UTne worst of it is that v/e cannot help them.   If we cculi% I m sure that everyone would do everything in his power to mitigate the troubles which the great mass of the poople have to hear as the result of tho groat war in which we have been engage    The only thing we can say about thorn is that although they involve very great hardships&apos; they are to this extent less than the trials we had to endure during the war, in the respect that we are not suffering the loss of the people who are deal? to us.    We shall all have to help each other through those difficulties.    I have got no doubt that this old country will*weather the storm of this depression, just as she has in tho past but we shall only weather it by enduring together and by trying to help oach other.Now, we, as a Government, have offered to the mining*industry at the present time, out of the pocket of the taxpayer, a sum of  10,000,000.
Believe me, that is a large sum for the taxpayer to find under present conditions, with all the other burdens which he hes got to bear.   Mr. Hodges has referred to the desire for peace.   There is nothing wo desire so much as that.   We should be serving the country very badly if we were to let thi3 matter settle without the prospect of continued peace for some time to come; indeed the country cannot boar these continual convulsions, and that is why in making the offer we have done, we have made it conditional upon a settlement being arrived at which will enable the country to do something to recover itself, and to retrieve from a state of great trouble and groat bitterness immense masses of people who to-day find it difficult to get the moans of sus-tonancoa   There is only one other remark I should like to make. I do not enter at ail upon tho controversial questions, some of which have been adumbrated by Mr.Hodge3, because to do so would only be taking up timo unnecossarily, and we have talked these things over together in many meetings now.   I should like to say, however, that I entirely agree that the basis of remuneration in the mining districts to-day is one of such confusion as to be a disgrace to the industry.   I hope that one result of this oonbrovoray will be that these wages will be put upon a proper footing, - that we shall get away from all prehistoric standards which are still operating, and that there will be set up a standard of 1981 for all districts upon which the futu.ro edifice of remuneration will be reared. I certainly, if I have anything to do with.it, J,f my advice is of any use to anybody, will urge.with all the insistence in my power that that result should be achieved.Well, gentlemen, I understand you are going to take the proposals I have made to you before your Conference, and 1 hope with all my heart that they will prove the.means of bringing about
about some settlement.   The condition which we are suffering from at the present time in this country is very grievous to everyone, and nothing is so much required to start the life of the country again   as a settlement of this coal dispute.MR.YARLEY; Just one point of explanation, Sir Robert.   You said, I think, that the Government were prepared to make a contri-bution which would not entail in any district more than a maximum reduction of 3s. a shift in May, 3s.6d in June, and any balance of the  10,000,000 afterwards to be divided as to two-thirds in July and one-third in August. If after that we desired a uniform reduction the Government would facilitate the collection of the sum-----THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER: After that, no; I said during the period.HR.VARLEY: During this temporary period.   Does that mean this, -that if a contribution from the better-situated districts was collected and the effect of tho distribution of that was to give 6d. per shift more spread over the whole, that the Government would still pay this amount of contribution.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER: The  10,000,000, certainly. You get your  10,000,000 whatever you contribute, or whatever the owners contribute from their standard profit.   You would still get the  10f000,000.MRoVARLEY: And anything which was shared amongst the various districts in May would not be debited against that distriot and lessen the Governmental contribution for June?THE CHANCELLOR/
END.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER:     No, not at all. I took the period of two months because it is impossible to perceive quite what is going to occur to the industry. I am perfectly clear that the ten millions will considerably more than cover these two months,     In fact I will tell you quite frankly that my estimate is that these two first months should not require more than about  5,100,000 upon the basis that I have put forward - a reduction of 3/- in the first month and 3/6 in the second month - and the whole balance will be available for the two following months.     I suggested two-thirds in the month of July and a third in the month of August, because I think that expresses the need of the industry more.   Although I have said this is a final proposal, if you were to suggest to me that you would rather have that balance divided differently, or if experience in the month pf May and the first half of June was to indicate to you that it would be better to divide it in some other way over the two months, why that is a matter undoubtedly for arrangement.   I am only trying to see how I can serve the industry best in putting the matter in the way which I have done. I propose, Mr.Hodges, if you do not object, to send the note of the Governments offer to the Press at onoe.MR.H0DGK5:    Would it not be better as we have got the notes, Sir Robert, for the purpose of our Conference, to send the whole thing to the Press - your statement and mine together?THE OttiHOEfiLOB OF THE EXCHEQUER:    Yes, certainly, I mean that,     I would not think for a moment of keeping it back.MR.HODGES:    Do not send your note to the Press before we send ours.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER:     Certainly.    We will send the whole &quot;thing to the press as soon as we get it transcribed.
