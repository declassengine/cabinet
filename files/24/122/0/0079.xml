Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.cs^^ Cabinet Minute.a$W _I wish to raise tho question of obtaining on special terms articles of equipment and warlike stores for the re-equipment of the Indian Army from surplus stocks under the control of the Disposals Board. This has been under discussion with the War Office and the Disposals Board since March 1920 without result, and the&apos;delay in arriving at a decision which will enable re-equipment to be proceeded with is seriously impeding the re-organisation of the Army in India.The stores which India stands in need of, and of which surplus stocks are known to be awaiting disposal, arc :--Guns, of all natures, including anti-aircraft guns; trench mortars; artillery equipment; ammunition; bombs; revolvers; Verey-light pistols ; mobile workshops ; signalling gear; engineer stores; hospital outlits; web equipment; U.A.F, stores; and minor articles of equipment of various kinds. The surplus stocks are available either at home, in India, or in other stations overseas, such as Egypt and Mesopotamia.The delay in reaching settlement has arisen over the question of terms. The best terms which the War Ollice or the Disposals Board have so far offered are 50 per cent, of vocabulary price, which have been accepted provisionally as an interim rate, pending investigation of the question as a whole.This offer was made last August after live months&apos; correspondence. As a result of it, after considerable demi-official discussion, the Disposals Board were informed in detail of the financial position of India, and asked to state whether they were prepared to grant better terms. Indeed the matter is one of high policy which must bo settled by the Cabinet. I am constantly receiving fresh appeals from the Government of India and the Commander-in-Chief for au early decision, and fresh evidence that the delay will affect very seriously military efficiency, and that in the present difficult financial position of India essential re-equipment can be carried out satisfactorily only if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to recognise the special claims of India, and to give special terms to her.There are strong reasons of policy for according special terms to India in this matter. My colleagues are well aware that the crippling burden of military expenditure in India is reacting seriously on both the financial and political situations. Fifty per cent, of the expenditure provided for in this year&apos;s budget is for military measures. The re-equipment necessary to bring the Army in India up to the pitch of efficiency is on a gigantic scale for the war has revolutionised the problem of equipment and its cost is prohibitive in present conditions. The stores which I have mentioned are vital to the 4044     100 5.21
efficiency of the Army in India, but unless they can be obtained on special terms such as I now ask for, the financial position will preclude their being obtained in anything like sufficient quantities,In asking for special terms for India, I wish to remind my colleagues that not only have the Domiuioiis and Colonies been allowed to acquire material at specially favourable rates or free of cost, but that certain of our Allies, e.g., Poland, have been granted surplus munitions either gratis or on repayment at nominal rates.The situation has now become one of very great urgency.Having regard to India&apos;s contributions in men and money during the war and to her very great need, and on the other hand to the treatment on the matter of stores accorded to certain of our Allies, I feel justified in asking for an early decision that surplus stores of the type required should be made over to India without payment. But if this cannot be accepted. I would urge most strongly that a substantial rebate should be given on the terms already offered. I understand that the Disposals Board have sold surplus material to other Government Departments on terms which included a considerable rebate on the market price.E. S. M.26th May 1921.
