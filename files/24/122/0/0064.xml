(xrvefere:ice C.Z.2nd keeti^ig, Minute 8).1.        The Suo-Conaittee have had six meetings.   They have tfcken under review in particular the Establishments Institutions and general organisations for Research work financed from the Pevelop-ment j?und or from annual votes, and administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries, and the Departments concerned with Agriculture and fisheries in Scotland and Ireland,   On several of the sections of this work they have had the advantage of recent re-ports and statistics prepared by th-^se Departments, and, in the case of Pisheries Research a report submitted in September last by a special Committee which had dealt fully with that subject. They have conferred with a representative 3f the War Office on the research work and requirements   if the Army Veterinary Service. They have taken -.*ccasi*:i te discuss with the Secretary of the iiedical Research Council and the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research matters in which research for Agriculture and fisheries csaes into cl:.se relation with research w.rk falling within the scope sf these Departments.At the instance of the Forestry Commission the Sub-Committee sulxzitted an Interim Report ?n the co-ordinatisn of Pcrestry Research.     In that Report, dealing with proposals for a new organisation for research in a particular interest, they applied the general principles upon which they have based their recommendations as to the co-ordination of existing research organisations in the field which they have had under review.
i    i       -   3,09******2,        In considering their reference the Sub-Committee have had regard not only to measures nece3sary t- prevent overlapping in the application ^f State funds for research, hut also to the measures required tc keep Departments informed of subjects wtlh which other Departments were dealing and out of which information likely to be of corza-n interest might emerge.   The Committee are of opinion that waste of effort is quite as likely to arise because of failure on the part :f Departments to appreciate the bearings ofiteach other&apos;s work as it is because cf overlapping. 3i       Reference may first be made to the steps taken to secure co-ordination in research in the subjects, Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry., betwoen 1910 when the Development Commission was established, and 1920.**he primary object of the Development Act was to secure the economic development of the natural resources of the Boils and fisheries of the United Kingdom.   In this wide field progress could not be otherwise than slow.   The Development fund tear, accordingly created so that the Commissioners might take a comprehensive view of the requirements of different parts of the Kingdom and base on that vier; a policy which could be followed consistently throughout the period required for the attainment of the desired results. IThilo funds placed at the disposal of spending departments aided by the Commissioners appear on their Annual Votes, the Fund provided by the Act was intended to suffice for a scries of years. The approval of the schemes submitted few grants from, the Fund necessarily involved co-ordination.Progress in co-ordination has been gradual and has depended on the particular circumstances of the subjects dealt vrith by the Commissioners.   In the oase of &quot;Agriculture&quot; it vas found, when they began their work, that much attention to the needn of the industry had already been given by the Departments responsible, and it v/ac posaible without much delay to approve schemes for Research.A scheme was adopted in 1911 which has gradually come into operation, and is nov relatively veil developed.    A statement of
\. 310the work in progress ha3 &quot;been furnished to the Committee; but the * essential featurec of this scheme have been described in Chapter II of the Commissioners Tenth Report published recently so that reference to its details iu unnecessary here.&quot;Fisheries&quot; had received leae attention, and until after the Development Act came into operation but little assistance towards research work had been provided by the State.   The Do-partments responsible have since given much consideration to Fishery Research and comprehensive schemes from England and Wales,. Scotland and Ireland were under the Comtnifiaionere1 consideration, at the outbreak of war.   After the war the.. Coimnijraiojierfi act. up a Committee to advise on the various national schemes. This CoxDmittee^s Report hat been received and effect has been given to its main recommendations.    The actual steps taken to promote Research are desoribed in the Tenth Annual Report already referred tc;   but it may be noted that, with the object of seouring olose co-ordinabion, an Inter-departmental Conference on Fishery Investigations has been constituted whioh meets at regular intervals.In the case of &quot;Forestry&quot; when the Development Act came into operation there was practically no research in the subject and the problem of co-ordination did not then ariue.4.       With respect to the subjects aided from the Development Fund the position was, therefore, that co-ordination had received atten-tion where co-ordination wias necessary.   There was formerly no risk of overlapping, since the Fund was the only considerable source of grants for the subjects in question.   With the creation of the Medical Research Committee (now Council) and of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research a new position arose and over-lapping became possible.The Sub-Committee are of opinion that, in fact, no appreci-able overlapping has aa yet occurred, but dearly, alike in the spheres of Disease, of Industry, and of pure science arrangements with a view to co-ordination of researoh are now called for.- 8 -
5.        With respect to the Diseases of Animals the immediate danger is not so much overlapping, as the neglect of diseases of importance both to the Medical and Veterinary professions. The fcovelopment Commission; acting in conjunction with the Medical Research Council, have recently set up a Committee with the following reference&quot;To report on the facilities now available for the Scientific study of the diseases of animals, to indicate what extension of those facilities is desirable in the immediate future in order to ad-vance tho study of disease whether in animals or man, and to advise a3 to the steps which should be taken to secure the aid of competent scientific workers in investigating diseases in animals.&quot;(v.       In connection with research into industrial uuestione, the noed for co-ordination is obvious since apiculture provides the raw material for several of the industries for which the De-partment of Scientific and Industrial Research have already format Research Associations (Fool, Linen, Leather, Sugar).   Again Agriculture may be the luotdiaer of induotrieo; ao in the case of the Agricultural 1/Laohinery trade, for which a Research Association has boen suggested.    It i3 certain that some of the subjects of Research proposed on bohalf of these industries will have a definite interest for agriculturists, and the converse proposition will in almost all cases hold good, inasmuch as all improvements in the production of raw materials are likely to benefit manufac-turing industries.7.       In a memorandum prepared by the Chairman, a copy of which i3 enclosed, certain principles governing the distribution of Sts,te grants in aid of Eesearoh are discussed. This memorandum
has been considered by the Sub-Committee and they agree with the principles therein laid down.The Sub-Committee feol that it ia of muoh importance, in the interest of economy, no less than in that of scientific research, to maintain a olose association between State depart-ments, such as the departments of Agriculture and of Fisheries, which are engaged in the development of national industries and in those branches of scientific research which bear direotly on the advancement of these industries.   At the came time no clear cut divisions, having as their cbjoot the association of one science or group of sciences with one Department would be possi-ble;   it would be $quite impracticable for example to associate all physiological research with the Medical Research. Council, and all chemical research with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.    These circumstanoes load us to recommend, not separation, but co-ordination of functions in expending State funds on Research.8.       Nearly the whole of the State funds at present available for the promotion of research in Agriculture and Fisheries, the diseases of animals or plants, the Industries using agricultural or marine products and in branohes of Bcienoe which may at any time bear closely *n any of these subjects, come within the purview of the Development Commissioners, the Jaedical Researoh Council or the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In the great majority of cases the subjects aided throughihe respective funds are readily distinguishable, but border-line questions aralikely to arise in increasing numbers.Such bordor-line investigations and others which, like those on animal diseases, to which reference is made in ^ 5 above, concern simultaneously two or more Departments and thus lend themselvoD to joint responsibility in accordance with some agreed procedure,
? S.C. (A)-9.

An illustration of the need for an easy mechanism for co-ordinating research work in the field here discussed, is afforded by the Report of the Committee on Agricultural Machinery and by the memorandum on that subject  which is submitted herewith.Ø From the discussion in the memorandum it would appear that effective action will require to be arranged by close conference between the different authorities concerned and possibly by the formation of a joint committee, to work out a method of securing the co-operation of the various parties interested in the relevant scientific investigations on soils, the design of the machinery, the testing of machines in process of development and the tests in the interests of purchasers of machines on the market.

The attached note on research work in various sections of Oceanography shows that the great economic interest of Fisheries here comes into touch at many points with investigations under several Government Departments. As a matter of practice there is a great deal of Inter-Departmental co-operation in such matters, but with the multiplication of authorities working in various and often distant centres, it would be of definite advantage to have some standing mechanism to facilitate the correlation of these oceanographical enquiries which bear directly on Fisheries.

Again investigations initiated and pursued under one Department not infrequently yield results which may be of much importance in a field outside the scope of that Department. Thus an investigation in connection with wool might in the first instance be ?ided from the Development Fund because of its immediate interest to sheep breeders; but arising out of this work, industrial questions might emerge
which could nc** properly be assisted from that Fund but might be aided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research because of their importance to spinners or dyers or weavers.9*     The illustrations cited in the foregoing paragraph indicate that the subjects coming before any oo-crdinating body which may he set up might differ widely in character.    Clearly a Board constituted so as to be capable of organising Inve3tiga-tions in agricultural machinery could not bo expected to have the soecial knowledge required to deal with ?&apos;ork on Oceanography, or ^n the improvement of wool.   Moreover, such cases as those illustrated abov* arc likely to be numerous,    the   biological sciences are expanding rapidly; medisal rcsearohis now -being actively developed, and Research Associations have just begun to study questions bearing on the Lrcgress of many of our leading industries^,    ?ie are led, thereforet to the conclusion that flexibility is essential in connection with such arrangements for co-ordination as are made at the present time, 10,     The co-ordination which we lave in view may be easily scoured.     It has been pointed cut in Para,4 that the necessity for co-ordination arose when the creation of the Medical Research Council and the Department of Scientific and Industrial.Research made overlapping with the work of the Development Commission possible,    The   small risk of overlapping which has been shewn to exist would be removed if periodical Conferences were held between representatives of the throe bodies; and we suggest that such conferences should be arranged.There is a further, and in our opinien, a more important reason for poriodical conferences.    Those responsible for the provision of funds for research should have opportunities of &quot;comparing notes on the methods and results of different types of organisation&apos; for the consequnnce3 of lack of contact wouldbe/- 12 -
be likely to prove m^oh more cerioua than any small losses arising from overlapping.     In considering the subjects aided by grants, cr left untouched because of lack of support, we thin.&apos; that the official representatives would be aided if some independent men of science were present at meetings of the Conference,11.    v*e reco^i end, therefore, that the Development Commission, the medical Research Council, a&quot;u! tho Department of scientific and Industrial research be invited to arrange for periodical conferences to vvhich the Biological jacretnry of tho Royal Society should be invited.    Tho Conference should also have poT,ver to invite other scientific )ien to attend its meetings from time to time.12.     &apos; c do not surest, nor do we advise that the Committee should give r.ny specific reference to the Conference, aa we think it undesirable to limit the range of subjects which, in the light of future experience th  responsible appointing authorities may think it necessary to refer to the Conference; but we propose to state the matters vhich in our opinion should come before it.    They are j-(i) Consideration of the source, or sources, from v/hich aid should be found for suitable researches which have not been a arded grants from the development Fund, the medical Research Fund or from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, because of the &quot;border-line&quot; character of the applications.     It is assumed that in practice all such cases *vould be submitted tc the Conference.(ii) Recomrendationo for the continuance of valuable *?ork which has developed in such a wry as to bring it outside the scope of the fund originally aiding it or which maybe
be aided already by some other department,     In this way such cases as that referred to at the end of Para.8 would be provided for,(iii)   Frcosals for considered  *ation by Departments interested as to further provision for carrying on particular investigations; e.g. a nev; Research Hoard, or a Special CorTittee, or a ne*: institution.It will be noted thft we have already found it necessary to recommend the formation of a Forest Products Research Board because of certain questions which were brought to our notice and require attention,13,    Our objects being to fasten responsibility for co-ordinationprimarilyon tho three bodies/responsible for the disposal of funds for thework discussed in this Report end to secure greater flexibility in action than would be practicable if s large Intor-departmental conference iare set up, 7?e have advisedly omitted reference Inour recommendation in ^ara.11 to several Government Departmentsinterested in the \*ork$    In the event of the Conference beingmoved to consider a research which -as financed by any Depart-ment other than those indicate ed abovo, a representative of that department would be invited to net as a member of the conference for the ouroose of the consideration of that matter.As grants from the Development Fund are either grants to or through a Government Department, representatives of the Departmentsconcerned with th-. administration of Development Fund grants wouldbe invited to attend when questions in which they were directly interested were under discussion.(Signed)   T.H,MIDDLETON.&quot; V.

HIS BRITANI:IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).C R E T.1.0* (A) 8.COMMITTEE OH THE CO-ORDINATION OP ^iLffinU^RSHEARCinSE.AGRICULTURE SUB-COKMITTEE.THH RELATION OF STATE DEPARTMENTS TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. (Memorandum by the Chairman)9Before our report is drafted it will be desirable to consider one or two points on which our discussions have shown some difference of opinion to exist.The main purpose which our Committee has in view is to discover the best method of associating scientific research with certain departments of state, having regard to the interests of science and to the interests of the public. In the latter case we have to bear in mind the effect of association with scientific research on the efficiency cf the departments themselves.In discussing the classification of science far this purpose it Is clear that we cannot adhere to the grouping appropriate in educational institutions.    Vje cannot, in practice, e.g. refer all chemical investigations to the Government 6hemist and associate this subject with the Treasury, or all Botanical investigations to Kew, and associate this science with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Nor can we group the sciences into Pure and Applied and associate all branches of pure Science with one Department and all applied researches with another.    The terms pure and applied refer to the objects of investigators and not tothnlr methods;   thus the same piece of work
-   318******might be &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;applied&quot; according to the ultimate object of the person engaged in it.It has been ou^-ested that we might escape from thia dilerrma by separating &quot;fundamental&quot; research from other kinds, but what are the &quot;other kinds&quot;?    In the popular use of the terra &quot;scientific research&quot; much confusion Is caused by tho failure to discriminate between scientific research and *ork done rdfch scientific appliances.    It ia not realised that a person nay be using microscopes, balances, etc., but nay not he engaged in research, the public analyst&apos;s business, for example, is not research, though popularly he nuy be supposed to be engaged in research and there is much *ork going on in laboratories of a parallel kind, which is not research.)In order that this laboratory vork nay be &quot;research&quot; two conditions are ?iecessary (1) there must be the effort to add to knowledge (2) the effort must involve, in some degree, original conceptions or methods.    If the analyst, departing from a standard method, attempts to discover a better way of ascertaining the composition of a substance, his work becomes research; and though the problem may be a simple one his work is no les:; &quot;research&quot; than the investigation of the most difficult questions.     If we agree that in order to be classed as &quot;scientific research&quot;, scientific work must fulfil these two conditions, the question arises what we are to include among these &quot;other kinds&quot; of research which are not &quot;fundamental&quot;.Fundamental research may perhaps mean research in connection with the fundamental sciences^    But which are the fundamental sciences? I shall not attempt to pursue this enquiry.Two other su^-suggestions seen to underlie the use of thisterm.In many kinds of scientific research &quot;team Fork&quot; is necessary, and certain members of the team nay be employingP 16 -
scientific Methods under direction.    Admittedly it is difficult to determine Just ?,h.ere the ?:ork of a particular member of this team may be placed*     The director alone ray be in a position to say whether his ^ork is fundamental or not.    Fundamental in this sense r i,.:,ht be an important matter for a National Service Tribunal, but clearly in peace time *-e could not use this distinction for the purpose of associating the work with one or other state department,    A second&quot;meaning that may ho attached to &quot;fundamental&quot; is that there are certain kinds of knowledge v&apos;hlch must be made available before further progress is possible, e,g, the Rothamated investigations on fertility show that it is associated with certain protozoa in tho soil, most of these protozoa have not hitherto been described, the number vnries extraordinarily from day to flay, and f.pDarently in conformity with some le*r or lo*&apos;s regulating their existence.    The variation in number is now being studied in the hope of getting some clue to these undiscovered laws.    The   object in this case classifies the work as &quot;applied science&quot; the methods employed are those of &quot;science&quot; (neither the term pure nor applied is appropriate) the research is &quot;fundamental&quot;) but because it is fundamental it could not be separated from the other work of Gothamsted; nor, for this reason should the work cf Rothameted be associated with a department other than the Ministry of Agriculture,It must be obvious I think that no State Department administering funds for the encouragement of research could/4lay do,nn in advance the rule that fundamental problems arising in the course of that research should not be tackled.    Fo competent worker engaged in scientific research could b** &quot;warne&apos;.&apos; Off&quot; the approach to fundamental problems.    If the State wore to attempt through co-ordinating authorities, to take suoh action-the effects on the progress of scientific* 17 t*
research would be disastrous.

I reach the conclusion therefore that, while from the point of view of the objects aimed at, research may be regarded as "pure" or "applied", and while from the character of the work the term "fundamental" may be more or loss appropriately made use of in description, no classification based on these conceptions of science can properly be applied in relating science to the State. Nor can we usefully employ the ordinary classification of the University, and relate Chemistry with one State Department, Botany with a second etc.

A number of State Departments may be interested in the same branches of Science and it will not be practicable in all cases to effect clear cut divisions; but it seems to me that if we start off with recognition of the fact that there must, inevitably, be much give and take between Departments; both Science and the State would secure most benefit by associating groups of Scientific workers with particular departments. Recognising the position that more than one Department may be interested, association should be established with the Department mainly interested; thus, at present all research bearing chiefly on the groat manufacturing industries of the country would be associated with and aided by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research; while Agriculture and Rural Industries would be associated with the Departments of Agriculture. Following out this principle, research bearing primarily on the public health would be aided through the Medical Research Council; research in marine science through the Fishery Departments, and research on questions of afforestation through the Forestry Commission.

To ensure the successful working of this plan in practice it would be necessary to make arrangements through assessors, or otherwise, which would enable departments, such e.g. as the Medical Research Council and the Departments of Agriculture
equally interested in certain diaoasos, to keep in touch with each other&apos;s work.    It would further bo necessary to have a standing committee on which all tho Departments woro represented to decide as to the allocation of such &quot;border lino&quot; subjects, e,g, tho development of research on flax, which interests both tho Department of Sciontifio and Industrial Research and the Irish Department of Agriculture elosoly.    The Standing Committee might bo attached to tho Department of Sciontific and Industrial Research.This Committee might serve another useful purpose.    It is desirable that tho Departments engaged in promoting research in tho Mother Country should bo in touch with those Departments, which, like tho Board of Trade, the Colonial Office, and tho India Office, ar^ promoting roeearch In cotton, sugar, flax and other important staples throughout the Empire    If such Departments wore roprosonted on tho Standing Oommitteo a common meeting ground would bo provided which would be likoly to assist scientific roaoaroh both at homo and abroad.I take it that tho purposo for which the Committee on Co-ordination of Sciontific Research was set up was not merely to prevent State Departments from wasting their own rosources and tho time of scientific men by pursuing their work indopond-ontly, but that it aimed at scouring arrangements which would be likely to ensure on the one hand the advancement of science and on the other the fullest possiblo application of scionco to industry.    Since tho war the value of ocionce to tho oom-raunity has become much more fully rocognisod In this country. Beforo the war, as the result of much effort, a moasuro of Stato recognition was secured for the value of science as applied to
the agricultural industry.    But it took tho experiences of war to induce this country to oxtond this recognition to the ether groat industries,This first stago in the process of development has now beon accomplished;   but though no doubt recognised, little li z boon hoard oo far of the valuo of industry to scionco. Tot tho induotrios can do such for students of scionco;   and not merely by providing posts for thorn to fill.    Tho new problems which industry supplieo and the oont&amp;ct  with skilled workers engaged in industry, may havo a most salutary of feet. I am naturally familiar with what tho industry of agriculture has dono in this way and I think that though twenty years ago this subject was regarded with misgiving by many scientific members of univorsitlos, it will now be admitted that oontact with agricultural problems has often boon helpful to atudente of scionoo.If thon, as I bcliovo, not only is soionoe msoful to industry but industry is usoful to ocience, tho development of scionoo, no loss than the progress of industry, mill be affected to some extent by tho policy which tho State adopts in co-ordinating its sciontific work.    It would bo unfortunate if any change made with a view, to co-ordination should weaken&apos; tho relationship which now exists botwoon science and industry in the case of tho departments whose work has boon considered by this Sub-Oommitteo,This point ohould be kept in view in the- framing of our Report.(Initialled).Dean&apos;s Yard, .S.V7. october, 19130.

The Report of the Departmental Committee on agricultural machinery makes oertain recommendations for research with a view to the further development and improvement of the mechanical plant used in agriculture.2. In Section 41 of the Report a distinction is drawn between,;pure research &apos; on the one hand and &quot;applied research&quot; and &quot;experiment&apos;1 on the other.    Pure research is defined as the determination of the principles underlying the use of the various classes of machines and implements and it is stated that investigations of this character must be pursued without specific reference to the practical application of any truths which may be discovered.Applied research Is defined as the application of the results of pure research to determine methods whereby they can be utilised in Industry;   the investigation of existing machinery or implements in the light of such scientific knowledge as exists is termed &quot;experiment1&apos;..In drawing a distinction between pure and applied research, the Committee make It qu4.te clear that they are aware that in practice no sharp division between the two is possible.As examples of &apos;pure research&apos;, the investigation of the methods of cultivating the soil and of the physiological and bacteriological problems that must be solved before an efficient milking machine can be produced are quoted0    The desxgn ofI - Si- i
ploughs or other implements to follow the lines determined by 324 the Soil physicist is mentioned s3 an example of applied research ;   another example of this type of research which is given in the discovery of the means of employing labour to the best advantage so as to avoid unnecessary fatigue.In dealing with the means to be adopted for carrying out the necessary research, the Committee recommend inter-alia(a) that certain Investigations dealing with dairy machinery shall be conducted at existing research and educational dairy institutions.(b) that the tractor and possibly other branches of the agricultural engineering industry shall co-operate in the establishment of a Research Association.(c) that the Rothamsted Experiment    Station shall be encouraged to proceed as quickly as possible with the Investigations into soil physics and the problem of tilth, as well as of the relation of mechanical operations to the destruction of weeds and 1 insect1 pests.(d) that other branches of research shall be undertaken at the Research Institute on Agricultural J&amp;chinery which the Ministry of Agriculture propose to establish.The Committee state that in their opinion the establish- -ment of a Research Association would not lessen the need for research In the directions they have indicated and refer specifically to the need for definition of the respective functions to be performed by the Research Association and the Research Institute.    In order to secure the proper correla-tion of the work of all the various agencies for research they recommend the formation of a Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture representing the Rothamsted Experiment Station, the projected Research Institute, the Research Association and other interested bodies and state that It would be the duty of this Committee, not to dictate or supervise research, but to secure that the field of
research is properly covered, that there is no unnecessary overlapping and that the various parties oonoemod arc kept in touch with one another.Thoso recommendations appear to contemplate an unnecessary complex organisation and leave entirely undefined the relations between the various bodice whiah arc to carry on the work, although the Committee of tho Ministry of Agriculture to which the tae  of dofining these relations is to bo committed will havo opon to it no sources of information whioh wore not availablo to the Departmental Committee itself.Further, they appear to bo based on the assumption that the &apos;pure research  to be lone is not only considerable in amount but is applicable to a number of types of machinery.Tho moot serious criticism of thorn howevor is that, they do not provide adoouately for the necessary co-operation between engineering research and agricultural praotioo.    To set up organisations for rosoaroh on engineering without establishing at the same time araplo provision for testing regularly and continuously the now devices which may be evolved does not a&quot;)6oar to be satisfactory.To take a parallel case.    The present efficient plant in use for cotton spinning could never have \beon evolved by engineers only:   it was necessary for tho tortile engineers engaged in improving and doveloping it to study carefully the precise ofrect of each new dovioe or modification of a machine on tho ordering of the fibres.    lixaotly the same necessity exists in the case of tho improvement end development of agricultural machinery, sines this machinery is intended to oxercise a o crtain effect on soil, wool, orops, etc.    In many oases thifc. effect is completely forosoon:   in others such for example, as that of tho cultivation o*j the soil further research is necessary before the precise effect to be obtained is known. !
-   326-   *.6. Reference to Section 35 of the Report lndioatei that theCommittee divide agricultural machinery into seven olasaes:-1.   Cultivating implements, which actually work the soil.2.   Harvesting machinery, all drawn along the surface of the land.3.   Stationary machines (a) grinders, chaff outters, eto. (b) threshing machines, etc (o) dairy machinery.4.   Engines and motors of all ,cintfs.5.   Machines used for drainage and other engineering works, including excavators, pumps, eto.6.   Shsep shearing and horBe clipping machinery and sheep dipping apparatus.7.   Spraying machinery.It is added that there is a further olabs of machinerynot specialised for agricultural use.7. An examination of thie list suggests that the &quot;pureresearch&quot; needed ino7.udos very little beyond that to which rer.trwrce is made in S S 42 - 44 of. the report, that is, research on the cultivation of the soil and on the physiological and bacteriological problems encountered in developing the milkine: machine.     The development of the other form3 of machinery depends mainly, if not entirely, either on tho . application cf well known mechanioal principles, or of prin-ciples which it ia the proper duty of organisations for engineering research to discover, to the task of converting hand tools or horse driven mvohinos into power driven machinery; this applies to machinery for chaff cutting, pulping, thrashing, e .oavating, pumping, sheop shearing, horse clipping, spraying and sheep dipping and also to engines and motors of ell kinds.It seems certain therefore that a &amp;reat deal of the work to be done will fill under the heading of 1 applied research  as this is defined by the Committee.8. In view of this it does not appear necessary to sotup both a Researoh Institute for Agricultural Machinery tt be financed by tho Ministry of Agriculture and a Research24 -
Association of Agricultural Engineers financed, partly by therioultural Angineoring Industry and partly by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.   Both organisations would be wording in the same field of research and overlapping of effort and needless waste of money would result.If thio view is sound, we are at once faced with the necessity of deciding whieh of the two ought, in the interests both of the makers of agricultural machinery and of the farmer, to bo established.n. Research Institute financed by a government Department would have most favourable conditions for gaining new knowledge but U;.leoS it worked in the closest connection both with the agricultural engineering industry and with the agricultural industry itself it would know little of the practioal difficul-ties encountered in producing under commercial conditions machinery intended to compete with American and other foreign machinery in the markets ol the world.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research has based itu whole procedure relating to industrial rasearoh on the principle tast it is best to delegate the responsibility for the discovery of new knowledge on the people and bodies who will have to use that knowledge when It is cained.     It ia true that i central c:tnte organisation mi&amp;ht make discoveries of use in industry more cheaply than an organisation controlled by the industry, but it is not sufficient to make the discoveries: the^e must be utilised to the full, ?nd this is most likely if the men who are responsible f *r maKing the discoveries are also responsible for applying them to the design of a&amp;rioul-tural machinery.Per this reason it is suggested that a Research Association including as far as possible the makers of all types of agri-cultural machinery would serve a more useful purpose than a Research Institute set up by the Ministry of Agriculture.There ere, however, as has been stated, above, two sets of interests to be considered - those of tha agricultural engineers end those of tha farmers.   Experience has shown that it is
usually impossible to secure OvO-K^ra^xm-^b^ and&quot;users1 in the same organisation, when they stand to one another, as in the present instance, in the relation of seller h a c  buyer.It is unreasonable to e:c:;ect that the farmer will contribute to researoh on the improvement of agricultural machinery, al-though he is so closely ooncerned in its success;   he is accustomed to receive regularly assistance and advice of all kinds from the Ministry of Agriculture and doubtless he will rely on this Department making the arrangements necessary for providing the information needed for the proper development of agricultural machineiy.The two sets of interests concerned can therefore be represented, on the one hand by a Research Association of i^ricul-tural 3n&amp;ineers and on the other hand by the Ministry of Agriculture, the closest co-operation between these being secured by the Establishment of the Joint Committee recommended in Section 60 of the Report.The Research association v-ould necessarily engage a Diroctor of Research and a suitable staff, &amp;nd would exchequer into relations with all the institutions which could afford it any assistance. In particular, it would co-operate through the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research with the Engineering Board of that Department and with the Research associations concerned wit a internal Combustion Engines and other branches of the Engineering Industry.The problems to be solved are concerned, however, with the application o? engineering to agricultural needs -and it is therefore essential that revision should be made for correlating engineering and metallurgical research with
agricultural research.   For example, in considering power driven cultivating machines, It is not sufficient to investigate the materials of which the parts corresponding to shares and ooulters are made, the e;;act shapo of these parts and the speed at whioh tractors can ho economically used;   it is necessary to consider also the effect of the cultivator on soils of different  kinds.This joints to the necessity of providing facilities at one or more Experimental Farming stations, where tho machines designed as tho rosult of investigations oariied out by the Research association or of research undertaken at Rothamstod Experimental station could be tried and daveloped.   It may be that the Rothamoted Experimental Station in itself has sufficient resources to enable it to undertake this work, but in viow of tho very varied nature of tho operations included under the term &quot;Agriculture&quot; and Of the different nature of tho soils in this country this aopoars to be doubtful.It is nox au$fcesto&amp; that a number of separate, self-contained Experimental Farms should be established a&apos;; oon-siderable e nenae, but that the joint Committee should have at their disposal in different oarts of the country certain facilities for continuous experiments on either the 1*0.13 attached to Agricultural Colleges and similar inatiouGious or on farms belonging to persons or bodies v/ho taice a keen interest in the development of agricultural machinery.In some oases, it would be sufficient for the Joint Committee to be able to rely on having a single field or even a vortion of a field available for experimental purposes; it is of ireat importance that they should bo able to carry on continuous investigations for prolonged periods, sinco
it is necessary in trying and developing a new form of cultivating machine, for example, not merely to examine the soil after tilling, out also to compare the yield with that obtained from similar land cultivated in other ways or with other machines.

In every case arrangements would be necessary for direction, supervision, and control to be exercised ? the Joint Committee, and it is probable that subsidies of moderate amount would have to be made by the Ministry of Agriculture. The arrangements would, in fact, have to be very similar to those which research organisations connected with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, propose to make with mills and works for testing and developing, on a working scale the utility of results obtained in the Laboratory.

?11. It is suggested that this scheme would have the advantage of simplicity. Further, it would ensure the co-ordination of knowledge drawn from both the engineering and the agricultural sides of the industry. The agricultural engineers, who, it must be remembered are anxious to secure their colonial and foreign markets, would have the means of gaining knowledge from their own and from other research organisations concerned with Engineering and Metallurgy which would enable them to produce machines designed on sound principles and adapted to the most carrying needs and conditions; further, they would have the opportunity of developing by actual experiments on the working scale machinery planned after scientific investigation on the laboratory scale.
12. There remains the important question of testing agricultural machinery which is actually on the market. The Committee, while recognising the value of the trials of agricultural machinery and implements that have already been carried out, emphasise strongly the need for setting up a permanent organisation for testing the capacity of machines of all kinds under widely differing conditions: they insist rightly that the tests should be prolonged for such a period as to disclose defects and that they should cover approximately the length of time that a machine under test would be in use during a normal farm year.

They are of opinion that the state should assume responsibility for testing machines and recommend accordingly that the Ministry of Agriculture should itself undertake the duty of conducting tests of agriculture machines and implements. For this purpose they recommend that a Central Advisory Committee to the Ministry of Agriculture should be established.

It is suggested that the end in view could best be secured by entrusting to the great national Societies, such as the Royal Agricultural Society and the Highland Agricultural Society the task of testing agricultural machinery which is already on the market. These organisations have in the past devoted considerable attention to this matter, and it is of great importance that their efficient means for discriminating knowledge amongst makers and users of agricultural machinery should continue to be utilised to the full.

If the great Agricultural Societies undertook to conduct trials of agricultural machinery systematically, taking into consultation agricultural and motor engineers and men with expert knowledge of the science of tillage in addition to the existing valuable element of practical farmers of long experience, and sound reputation, it would
be possible not only to oar^y-OTrt-^h^roughly^sBtisfLotory &quot; * tests end demonstrations but also to secure an unusual amount of publicity for them.Tho reports on such tests should be transmitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and carefully collated by that Department for the information of farmers generally.13. Tho Committee emphasise the importance of devotingattention to the application of electricity to agrioulture. This should be kept well in view by agricultural engineers, so that a move forward oan be taken ao soon as more extended distribution of oloctrioal power becomes possible or as local in?t llations : re established. 14. The Committee rooommend that an attempt should,be made to standardise the parts of agricultural machinery so a? to increase their interohsnpeability.   There is no doubt that this would add greatly to the efficiency cf the maohinory, but it oan only be accomplished by the agricultural engineers themselves.   For this reason it appears desirable that the Research Association of Agricultural Engineers should take up the matter ouickly and arrive in collaboration with the Engineering Standards Association at common specifications for as m ny parts as possible.(Intd.)

Laterim Repor t on th9 Co-ordination of forestry Research,At the instance of the Forestry Commission, the 3ub-Committeo have had under consideration the &quot;Resolutions of the British Empire Forestry Conference, London, July 1920*, and they have boen informed that steps are now being taken for the initiation of various schemes recommended by the Conference.    The organisations and arrangements for the working of these schemes involve problems of co-ordination which the *;ub-Committee have had under discussion in relation to oxisting institutions.   They are not yet in a position to submit their complete Report, but in the case of a new organisation it is relatively easy to give effect to general principles of co-ordination, and the Forestry Commission have represented to the Sub-Committee that it would be of advantage to make their considered opinion on proposals for Forestry Research available now.    The Sub-Committee concurred, and they ftooordingly submit the following Interim Report giving their -views, on this matter.While the Sub-Committee have had before them the whole of the &quot;Resolutions of the British Empire Forestry Conference&quot;, they have considered more particularly paras. 8, 9 and 10 of tho Resolutions and &quot;Anneruro B&quot; which gives the Report on ForestryResearch prepared by a Committee of the Conference.They recognised that a case had been made out for the prosecution of Forestry Research, and they considered how the provision required for the several groups of problems mentioned in the draft scheme prepared at the Conference, should be made so as to take advantage of opportunities of co-ordination with,,     . oxisting- 33 -
existing authorities and establishments.A. With reference to &quot;Research into the growing of forest crop 8 &quot; they agroefa)   That there ou^ht to be within the United Kingdom and under the forestry Commission, a Research Institute to deal with problems connected with the growing of forest crops&quot;, so far as these fall under the following head(1)   Silviculture, including regeneration agd silviculturo systems.(S)   Statistical investigations as to rate ef growth and volume production which alone can provide the data essential for rational and economic forest management.(3)   rorest botany, including ocolegy and mycology.(4)   Merest Entomology.(b)   That for Research work on other subjects required in connection with 1&apos;erestry problems, and for any fundamental research other than that directed to an immediate economic result in relation to Forestry, the Forestry Commission should refer in the first instance to the appropriate authority.   Thus on ques-tiona on the rock-structure, and drift formations ef an area they would consult the Geological Survey; for research relating to soil investigations thoy should, in consultation with the Development Commission, and the itopartments of Agriculture, arrange tc make the greatest possible use of specialised investigators on such subjects at the Rothamstead Experimental Station or elsewhere; on questions bearing on Meteorology they would consult the Meteorological Servieo under the Air Ministry; so for investigations on machinery (tractors, &amp;o) they would turn in the flrat instanoe to tho &quot;Engineering Research Board&quot; now ostablished undor the Research Department and to the Advisory Committee on agricultural Machinery under the Ministry of Agricul-ture and Fisheries.   In any such oase where an es-tabliohed Government institution is responsible for the administration of the public provision for investiga-tlons in the department of scienoo ooncernod, the Forestry Commission 3hould not put research work in hand except after consultation with that institution.B. With reference to &quot;Research into the utilisation of Timber and other forest products&quot;. They agreed that for researoh under the heads,(l)   Wood technology, including the testing, seasoning and preservation of timber; and,(S)   Investigations into products other than timber, thero should be a research organisation which should include a central institute to deal with problems connected with thoutilisation
I-   337of forest products; that this organisation should &quot;be governed by a ;1esesroh Board under the Department of scientific and Industrial Hosearch; and that, as recommended by the forestry Conference, this 3oard should he composod of official and non-official members, and should be an oxocutivo body having definite sums allotted to it for resoarch on forest products.   It would be the duty of tne icard, after surveying tho whole position to docide where any particular problem should be investigated, and to distribute the funds at its disposal accordingly.The vub-Comralttee noted that tho British Empire forestry Conference in discussing the proposals to establish an &quot;Imperial forestry Bureau&quot; drew special attention to methods of co-oyeraticn with existing institutions.    The suggestions made in that rola-tion &amp;;pply with equal force to Research; thus it would be tho c*uty of the forestry Commission and the Merest Products Researeh Board, if establishes, to take full advanta^o of the fAcilliies for reference which already exist at the Royal Gardens, J ew; again stops should be taken to ensure that the timber exhibits at tho Imperial Institute &amp;re made available and are suitably arranged for the purposes of the 1&apos;orost Products Research Board.(3gd).
