BOARD   OF   EDUCATION.Higher Education Scheme for Ex-Service Students.1. On the 6th December 1918 the War Cabinet approved of ascheme prepared by the Officers University and Technical Train-ing Committee for assisting demobilised officers and men to pursue courses of higher education.   The coat of the scheme in England and Wales was estimated by the Committee at 6,000,000, on the basi3 of awards to 15,000 men at  400 each.The scheme as finally adopted included similar provision forassisted higher education in Scotland and Ireland, separateprovision for awards by the Board of Agriculture, and forawards by the Appointments Department of the Ministry of labour for practical training in offices, works, and professionalemployments.   The amount required for the work of the Appoint-ments Department was subsequently estimated at  6,000,000.2. In June, 1919, when certain administrative questions were under discussion with the Treasury, I informed the Chancellorof the Exchequer that it was very unlikely that the expenditureof the Board of Education, in respect of its part of the scheme,would reach the sum of  6,000,000, and I promised that when itappeared likely that our total commitments would reach a sum of 4,000,000 I would inform the Treasury.     On the 5th June wehad received only 743 applications for final awards and had made 1,700 interim awards.    These figures overlap to someextent, but at the most would involve an expenditure of some 750,000.   In September the number of applications from mensuitable for admission to universities and technical institu-tions, etc., and recommended for awards by the University Com-mittees, was so great that our total commitments for 10/797awards were about  3,200,000; and it became evident that the outstanding applications would bring the total up to just upon. 4,000,000, and that the further applications which might be
expected night require an additional  900.000.   The totalapplications at that time were 14,276.   On the 25th september and 2nd October I informed the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Treasury of the position.Since September applications from men recommended forawards have been caning in at such a rate that, on the best estimate we can make, it now appears   certain that the sum of 6,000,000 will be exceeded,    The figures are &amp;e followsTotal applications received by the Bb&amp;rd ofEducation up to November 15th,.19,596Total applications in the hands of University&apos;and Local Committees on november 17th.-.. 1,65821,2:6Deduct for rejections ......1,2&quot;5Applications in sight probably ranking&quot;for awards .....19,961* *       *Cost at  305 per award . 6............... r.  6^094,205The actual commitments of the Board up*to dateare for JL6.396 awards  4^983,324.There is no doubt that a considerable number of applicationswill still come in.   Only a small proportion of the out-standing applications are from men demobilised after the 1stSeptember.     The proportion of applicants demobilised afterthe 1st September will rapidly increase, and of 40Capplications received from the 14th November about one-quarter are from euch men.    But in estimating the number of applications which will be made between the 17th November, andthe close of demobilisation it would not be eafe to start froma later date than the 1st September,when 607,977 men remained
to be demobilised from the Army.    Allowing for the Navy it may beassumed that applications from a reservoir of 700,000 men may stillcone in.Any estimate of the percentage of these men who will makeapplications must be highly speculative.     It is not at. all likelyto be less than one-half of 1 per cent,and may be higher as theproportion of young men who are still thinking of education willbe higher among the late-comers.     At the rate of one-half of 1per cent, we nay expect another 3,500 applications, which would yield - allowing for rejections - 3,290 awards, and which, at therate of  305 per award, would cost  1,003,450.     This, added tothe  0,094,205 above-mentioned, would make a total of  7,097,655.Allowing for contingencies, it is possible that the total costof the scheme for higher education may be  7,600,000,This sum will of course be spread over several years,the greatest expenditure accruing in the three years 1919-20 to1921-22, after which it will rapidly diminish.The Committee on whose report the scheme was originallyadopted estimated that the awards would average  400 per head.   Inthis respect we are well within the estimate.     The average amountcf the awards shoWB a slight tendency to rise, but at the presentmoment (viz, November 15th) on 16,296 awards the average is only 306 per head.    On the   original estimate of 15,000 awards the totalcost would have amounted to  4,675,000. - I must admit, however,that as regards the number of applicants who would be consideredsuitable and recommended by the Universities etc for courses of hire^ier education, both the Committee&apos;s estimate and our o^n havebeen very far out.     Owing to the circumstances of the case it wasimpossible to make anything better than a guess, and we have madea bad guess.     The material factors which have swollen the numberof applicants since the early days of the scheme are, I think,(a) the propaganda of the Military Authorities and the appointments Department in making the scheme widely knownthroughout the Army, which has had a great effect.(b) Tho Army Education Scheme has induced many men, whowould otherwise have remained indifferent, to think seriouslyof completing their education,
(c) The universities and technical institutions have shownan unexpected readiness to stretch their accommodation and teach-ing power, and the limitation ef the possible number of awardswhich we expected to arise through the inability of the univer-necessities to accommodate and&apos;teach any more students has notoperated.     The universities (and it is certainly not to theirdiscredit) have expanded, and are apparently ready to expandalmost beyond the bursting point.(d) The difficulty which demobilised men of good educationhave experienced in obtaining suitable employment has beengreater than was anticipated.(e) The number of applicants to the Board of education has been much greater in proportion to the number of applicantsto the Appointments Department than was expected.     It was originally estimated that there would be two applicants to the appointments Department for one to the Board of Education;though on the other hand the value of the average award by theappointmenta Department might be about half the average award of the Beard of Education.     It now looks as if there would be an equal number of applicants to the Board and to the AppointmentsDepartment, though   tho estimate of the average value of therespective awards has proved about right.This consideration is very important.        It wasimpossible to do more than guess how the applicants would die-tribute themselves between the Board of Education and the appointments Department, or how many men the Appointments Depart-ment would   send on to the Board, and the change in the ratiosexpected should be taken into account.     I think the only fair and possible way of dealing with tho natter is to treat the workof the Appointments Department and of the Beard as a whole.Looking at the whole natter broadly, I do not think thatin spite of the large expenditure involved the Government have any reason to feel dissatisfied with the working or result of thescheme,     Prom all sides we hear glowing reports of the keennessand good conduct of the men and the almost embarrassing zeal w:ihWxiich
which they pursue their studies.     The men have, at avery critical period in the history of the universities, notonly assimilated all that iB he8t in the old tradition hut have established a new tradition of hard work and thrifty living, whichwill have a great effect on future generations of students.   Itcannot be doubted, moreover, that the passage of so large a numberof ex-service men through the universities will do a great deal toestablish in the Nation a university habit and general appreciation of the value of higher education which has hitherto been lacking,From the point of view, moreover, of social unrest the relief af-forded by withdrawing these men temporarily from competition for employment is by no means a negligible consideration.     The cori-pletion, moreover, of the men&apos;s courses will be spread over a con-siderable period.     They will not come on the employment market allat once, and when they do come it is reasonable to expect that employment will be more plentiful.   Apart from this and from allsentimental considerations of the nation&apos;s debt to the young menwho fought for it, it is indubitable that only by means of so:.7iesuch scheme would it have been possible to replenish the stock of highly educated men which is required for the Nation&apos;s service aridvrhich has been terribly depleted by war casualties.     There is,it is true, Borne lose as well as gain.    With so large an influx of students some lowering of the standard of admission was per-haps inevitable, though in every case the authorities cf the uni-universities themselves have accepted the men as suitable for university work.     Of this they were the only possible judges.Alsot the difficulty of finding sufficient teaching staff for so large a number of students has been very great, especially as the universities have lost some of their best young teachers.   the teaching, therefore, is possibly not so good as it was before thewar, and the teachers have had much less time for private&apos;study and research.    But I h*ve no doubt whatever that the gain tothe universities and the students, and through them to the Nation,vastly outweighs the loss.
7311The question for decision is, whether the scheme may go on and further awards, in excess of the sum of six roillionsoriginally allocated to the Board of Education, may he made.If no excess is allowed, no awards can he made after the 1stDecember.   To cut short the operation of the scheme would giverise to grave discontent.      The men demobilised at a lateperiod would feel themselves very unfairly treated in comparisonvdth the men who received early demobilisation and who have applied for and received awards.     It may be possible to discriminate further against late-comers who had only a short period cf service before the Armistice, though it isprobable that a considerable number of these are young men who,during their retention in the Army, have been officiallyencouraged to pursue their studies Ydth the express object of proceeding to the Universities, with Government assistance, assoon as they are demobilised.    But after making all allowance for any possible discrimination on the ground of short service or delay in making application, there will be among the menrecently demobilised and still awaiting demobilisation a con-siderable number who could not be deprived of the advantages of the scheme, on the ground that the funds are exhausted,without giving rise to a very serious sense of grievance.The savings which can be effected by more stringent adminis-tration, and by eliminating those award-holders who do not prove worthy of Government assistance (and we have urged the universities to keep a close watch on the progress of the students), are not very great, if we are to avoid, as I think we must, the creation of serious grievances on the ground of unequal treatment.     I think, therefore, we must face thefact that, though the total estimated cost of the scheme asadministered by the Beard of Education and by the AppointmentsDepartment
Department will not be exceeded, the estimated cost of thescheme as administered by the Board of Education must be exceeded,and I suggest that the limit should be raised provisionallyfrom 6 millions to 7-J&quot; millions,I think that the proper way of looking at the matter isto treat the  12,000,000 provisionally allocated in equalshares between the Board of Education and the AppointmentsDepartment as a sum open to redistribution as circumstancesindicate.     It is not expected that the Appointments Depart-ment will require to spend more than 4 millions, and there is thus some 2 millions available for redistribution.
