His Highness tho,Emir Foisal.paid a,. 2nd Iwraber, 1919.Your Highness,You have Veh good enough to inform me, in your letterof the 25th October last, of the anxi ty whioh th.r decisionof thr- P&apos;ace Conference on..thA. 15th 3-*pt*mber last, withregard to the replacement of British, &quot;by French troops, ina defined zone in Syria and Cilicia, has caused you.You fear that the execution of such a r-solutionmay be regarded by th* Arabs and Syrians as a partition of Syria, and that it may thereby give rise to trouble, forwhich you can take no fr^sponsiWlity....... In order to it old supha ecntingendy, Your Highnesspropbses1, that a Committee shall V set up, and that itf atoll *xamin- thy best m-ans of Carrying out the evacuation by the British troops, and of forming a provisionaladministration of such a kind, that the unity of the country shall be protected, harmony between the.different occupiedzones upheld, and th.- rights of the . inhabitants 0 cured.,  I havr, taken note of your opinions with much sympathy,and beg to inform you, in a genfral way,, that&apos; the FrenchGovernment has never wavered, from its dbooore desire to assure to Syriay Mesopotamia, and to. other Eastern countries,sot free by the victory of the Allies, a regime of liberty,order and progress1, conformable to th** liberal principlesof its own policy, which ar-&quot; also these of th-&quot; P&apos;&apos;acpConf* r no-.-.I remain convinced that the. confidence&apos; of th&quot; arabs and thv&apos;ir Allies towards one ahother, which has grown outof a wa,r waged in common, will nllow their relationotogether to be settled in a manner consonant with th-.-irtraditions, with the wishes of the populations, and withtheir ocinnon interests.     The Frenoh and EritishGovernments will always be as closely associated in (thismatter, in timeg of peae% as they were in times of war.
The question that you place before me now, is ^more limited,, and appears to me very simple; it is only&apos;aquestion, of fact, and does not in any way modify that of rights.   Neither the political status of Syria, not its final frontiers, are put in question.   Your om anxiety,and such anxiety as the population of your country may eventually experience, should be easily dissipated.   Inthe regions &quot;here French soldiers will replace Britishtroops, I am convinced that our military leaders willbe- able to reassure the populations, and maintain order,.It *rill fall to ycu to make use of your great authorityto secure the same objects at Damascus and Aleppo.I am quite ready t* come to your assistance, the ve^ymoment,that you ask for help, in maintaining order, if it&apos;should1 ever be disturbed by agitstors v, who could cnlycompromise Arab interests, and lessen&apos;the confidence that-&quot;the Conference is always ready to placa in them. .A mere recital of the facts will show you that the nomination of a committee would only complicate the situatiand w*juld be at variance with the resolution of theSupreme Council.fax the 15th September lasti Mr. Lloyd George informed the Conference that the exigencies of demobilisation wouldforce him to *dthiraw the British treopa from Cilicia and syria, and he proposed that the British forces should bereplaced by French troops.   The Supreme Council upheldthis recommendation (decision) and to?k note of the re-observations made by the French President of the Council onthe other points raised in Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s memorandum;the Council further decided that this military arrangement was only provisional in character, and did not prejudice the, ultimate solution of the questions of mandates andfrontiers, problems which were to be settled when the whole position. In the East was dealt *Tith.In these corcumstances every possible guarantee forthe future has been given; the political question is entirely held over; local administration is not altered,and no decision has been:taken with, regard to frontiers^The interests, which, as a whole ao justly occupy yourmind, remain imder the control of the peace Conference.It would not only be useless, but ^ould be contrary tothe resolutions of the Supreme Council, to nominate acommittee to study the best method of carrying out theevacuation, and of modifying the actual method of administering the country&apos;.As far as the future Is concerned I am quite ready to. study ^&apos;ith you the questions that now ccoupysuch place, in your thoughts, bearing in mind our greatcommon interests;:I am etc.(Sgd.)

Lettor from His^j^i     JLlJ^JLJS^E.I?isal to M. Clemenceau.,r                            SaOBIiiTARIAT OF THE HKDJAZ ffiJ&amp;BGATIOK.P ---------------Paris.5th KoTombor, 1919.Monsieur le President,I am honpy to note, in tho reply date* 2nd November,1919, so kindly sent to me by Your 3:ccollenoy, a freshconfirmation of tho sympathy that tho Frendh Government hasaaver ceased to show towards my nation, as wall as antvldent proof of its &quot;wish to obtain a regime of liberty*order and progress for Syria, Mesopotamia and all othorliberated Arab countries.,huvoThe Arabs who/fought for their lndepondenee must oon-gratulate themselves on these new assurances, which confirmprevious declarations, and reiterated promises, on the partof the Allied Powers.     I, personally, am particularlypleased,.in that I have, from the start, worked continuouslyto set up the policy of reciprocal understanding and confidence which has finally contributed to the defeat oftho enemy and secured the liberation of the country.With the object of upholding this friendship, andof maintaining this mutual confidence, I have ventured to insist, in my last letter, datoa the 25th ult,, on thoadvisability of creating a special committee, whoso functionsshould be the study of the best means of relieving thetroopsj and of establishing a provisional administration in syria, of such a nature as to protect tho unity of thatcountry, in conformity with the wishes of the population,Whilst thanking your ISrccelloncy for the good-will thatyou have shown in studying my proposal, I consider itmy duty, none the loss, to draw your attention to thefollowing points ;Your Excellency considers tho question of the relief ofthe troops to bo an extremely simple one, since it does notmodify the rights, nor question the political status, nor thofinal frontiers, of Syria,   The question would, indeed&apos;, havebeen extremely simplo had it only referred to a mere with-drawal of the troops in occupation or had the unity of theadministrative power been replaced by some other method ofGovernment (uh autre instrument), which should have,assuredsome form of co-ordinated rule (cohesion) between the differentdistricts of the country;If the political condition and final frontiers ofthe country are not put in question, the public lifo oftho population, and the unity of the country&apos;s administrationare none tho less seriously compromised.     Tho memorandum
of Mr. Lloyd Qnorpp, displays ah obvious desiro to puttho Secret Agreement of 1916 irito operation, an agreement which partitions the country, kills its existence, andprovokes:, as ii has always provoked, our 3trong*Wtprotests.     In addition to, this, a perusal of the TA^raorawaura,,,.is quite sufficient to show, that the question before us isnot that of a mere withdrawal of troops, but consists inthe delimitation of spheres of political and eodnomioinfluence; andj in fact in the settlement of the futurodestinies of our country in. the light of interests whichare foreign to it.     It is true that your ^jccalionoyhas not accepted the proposal as a whole, but It is equallytrue that tho Agreement represents the point of viow ofthe British Government - a point to which I havt not failedto draw its attention -; and it is as a result of myprotests and keenly contested arguments (conversationslaborinnsos) that I have been able to make ray viow prevailon the subject of the sotting up of a committee.These ominous contingencies keep the Arab people in a state of anxiety and mental tension; I have, moreover,drawn Your Excellency1^ attention to the state of mind nowprevailing amongst my people - a condition of affairs whichwill not settle down until a new solution intervenes.k &apos; My personal experience, and my knowledge of the Arabpeople, enables me to state to Your Excellency that the syrian people cannot be led by agitators.     It is a peoploconscious of its own rights and duties, and its conduct iaanimated by a single anxiety to securo its own libertyand independence.   It is this sentiment and self-oonscicus-ness that decided its participation in the war against itsown co-religionistsj at a moment when victory was still un-certain.    The Syrian people will not hesitate, today, todefend the liberty and independence ^cr which it fought, inthe same way that, yesterday^ it did not hesitate to sacrificeitself in ordor to obtain it.   All who have been in contact withthe Syrian people have been aware of this fixed resolve;and I call to witness tho American Committee of Inquirywhich rocehtlj came to the East.Your Excellenoy, who is certain that any popularmovement oecmring in regions occupied by French troops would be crushed, has shown himself ready to come to myassistance at once in order to help me to maintain order, ifit should ever be threatened by agitators in tho regionunder my control,I must inform Your Excellency that in the event ofthe contingencies to which I have drawn attention becomingrealities, they would not be the result of irresponsibleagitators,     The movement that will inevitably take placein the country /is
5Sis essentially a national one, against which for-, ign troops could hardly be called in, more particularly as theirintervention would not be understood by the Syrians,   More-over, the sentiment that has grown..up amrvngst the Syrianpeople has been directly inspired by the publit utterancesof rallied statesmen;   and it hrs been for. the triumph of thissentiment, that the grort nations, with France at theirhead, hav&apos;* passed through the most terrible conflict.The great leaders of. the Froneh Army have provoked theworld&apos;ft admiration by defending, simultaneously, their o&quot;-ncountry^, and tho deathless .principles of right and liberty;they would be somewhat embarrassed if called upon to dra^tke sword against a people,&apos; &quot;vho, in claiming th^ir own in- ependonce, do no more ibn  i.sk for thft s^me right andliberty, for which these distinguished la dcre hrVe foughtst gravely.The Supreme Council, by Acting Upon the altered situa-tion in Syria, without haying previously given me a hearing,&quot;hasplaced upon me a responsibility pregnant with possibilities.The Arab people have al,.vay.e endeavoured to frame theirttnduct in such a way as to deserve the confidence of theAllies;   it&quot;is in appealing to the principles enunciatedby the. Allies, that the Arabs have based their hopes ofbei*g.able to realise legitimate aspirations.   It lies with Your Excellency not to allow this confidence to bemisplaced, ner this conviction to be shaken.The anxiety which obseas^s mr, and, my insistenceupon these matters do not arise from personal pre-occupation.Animated as I am by an unflinching wish to scrTr^ my nation,and to be loyal to our Allies, I regard it as ray.duty toshow to Your Excellency ^hat the situation actually is, andnot to draw such a picture of it as certain persons ^ouldlikf to do.   I have, in my innermost consciousness, a clearpicture of the agitation which will shortly shake the whole country.     Th* dosire to maintain the best possible relationsbetween the Arabs and their Allies, and to ward off any danger that might threaten the existence of our young nation,forces me to raise the point afresh with Your Excellency, andto bog ycu to submit the question to further study. .Your Excellency aonsiders that su*h a procedure wouldbe at variance with the decision whereby the Supreme council has taken note of the resolutions of the two Allied&apos;Governments.     Since my responsibility is thereby involved,I consider it to be my duty to address the Supreme Councildirectly, and I take the liberty of expressing the belief,that rapporteur Excellency will use your powerful influence andgood will in facilitating my task, and in helping me todischarge the heavy responsibilities that weigh upon me.In ftoncluding, I beg to thank Your Excellency for the goodwill that he has displayed (dispositions favorables), byshowing yourself ready to collaborate with me in studying(at all events as regards the future) the questions now before us,     I beg, to repeat to you tho declarations already made by me to M. Berthelot, on the subject of my keen wishto arrive promptly at a final (definitif) agreement wherebytho liberty, independence, progress, and development ofthe Arab people shall be assured.-.I have etc.(Signed)   FSISA1.
