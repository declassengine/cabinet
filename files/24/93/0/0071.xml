DOCUMENT 13 THE PKiFBflTY OF HI,g BPITA.OIC MAJESTY&apos; S3 (fr)YLCTOTiQ 265BEOBBT CABINII--.,0.P.1S7 , \    IKTOXIOATINQ LIQUOR ( HE-GflTLATIQK), BILL..Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education,covering Draft Bill,1. general,.In aooordanoe with the Report of ttap Cabinet Committee onLiguor Bestriotions of May, 1919 (0.246), the Bill has been drawnwith the sole abject of securing the continued pursuit of measureswhich war experience baS indicated to be of importance in promotingsobriety.    The Bill inoludee nothing Trhioh cannot answer this test.The Bill ia not designed merely as a stop-gap measure.    Whileit does not seriously prejudioe the possibility of future aotion upcrwider and more fundamental lines, it is-believed that this Billpromisee , with efficient administration, to lead to subat&amp;irtialprogressive improvement in the conditions of the sale- and oonsumpticrof intoxicating liquor.2. Central Authority,The necessity for a Central Authority ia paramount on at leastfour grounda(1) the ohaotio conditions prevalent tefore the war were-attributable primarily to the absence of any CentralAuthority exclusively responsible or adequately empoweredto watch the drink trade in the national interest;(2) the work of licezising Justicea though of gteat value initself, has long stood in need of co-ordination, and theabsence of such co-ordination is a source of not ill-founded complaint by the Trade;(3) it is impossible to make statuite-law sufficiently elasticto meet the different and constantly changing conditions ofdifferent districts;(4) to some extent, the exact application/
of certain desirable principles is still in an ex-pcrimcntal stage, and measures taken in oonneotion withthem must therefore&apos; rc &quot;be capable of rapid and easy modi-fioatiun. -It is not proposed that the Central Authority shouldrepresent neotional interests of any kind; it is to be a small body of trained people.   It will be assisted by AdvisoryCommittees, of a widely representative oharacter, and it isto these committees that the appointment&apos;of individualsidentified with seotional interestawill be appropriate.The Central Authority tfill &quot;be responsible to parliamentthrough the Home Secretary, and will exeroiso &quot;besides  thenew powers conferred by the Bill, the powers with regard tolicensing now exeroised by him.3.   principal restrict!Tft Powers of CentralAuthority. -The principal restrictive powers will be:-(a) to control hours of sale and consumption:(b) to prevent abunes connected with off-sales,whioh might defeat the intention of theregulations as to hours;(o) to control the alcoholio strength of drink;(d) pending the establishment of a free market,to control price.4. Co-ordination of work of Licensing justices.The central Authority will work largely by administra-tive advice.   This is a real power, for which the constitutionalrelations between, the Home Secretary and the Justices afford&apos;a good foundation, and which the general tenQV   cf the bill will help to. make effective.The Commission are also empowered to make.- regulationsauthorising the Licensing Justices to make, provisions within their ana on points of local&quot; detail (Olause 6)..Finally, the committee are given appellate jurisdiction over the Licensing justices/in certain types of decision,including, refusal to renew or transfer licences and to sanc-tion structural alterations to licensed premises.
^*   Enoourogeraent of Improved Public Houses.This matter, which is an essential item in any liquorreform and which Licensed Trade regard as crucial, is pro-vided for by a number of measures inserted in different place a^^.in the Bill.     The most important are:-(a) the appeal to the Commission.against decisions by Licensing Justices:( l) refusing to authorise structural alterations?,   and( 2) ordering such alterations.(b) relief from extra licence duty on structural improve-ments designed to increase the facilities for recreationand trade in articles other than drink;(c) the provision making It an offence to refuse to supplyfood on reasonable demand.(d) the permission of music in suitable premises;(e) facilities for games and recreation,^&apos;   Suppression of Redundant Licences.^Clause 4. of the Bill Is based on the principle that theexisting machinery provided by the 1904 Act should be workedat full pressure, and should be supplemented to meet some difficulties of detail which have occumxjdn practioe, andthat more radical methods should only be adopted if the existing machinery, thus fortified proves inadequate.7.   Carlisle eto.The Bill provides that, until Parliament otherwisedetermines, the Commission shall carry on the existing EnglishState Management districts of Carlisle and Enfield Lock, andfurnishes them with the minimum powers necessary.It is also suggested that the Government should consider(in the light of the present state of public opinion on thepolicy of State Purchase,) the inclusion of a power to take^over new State Management districts under suitable safeguards,8 Canteens.
