\ THIS. POCTTMEHT IS, THB.,PROPERTY OF. HIS.BRirANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNS KENT.   cabinet,*ECRETCTTIJ$. THE SYRIAN QUESTION,NOtE TO THE SUPREME COUT&quot;OIL OF THE PEACE conference by HIS HIG.-J ;:. C- JHE ^ira FEISAL.I wan called in September from Dn.mar.-cua by His Excellency thePrime Minister of Groat Britain.to discuss tho Syrian Question with the Groat Powers.   In London, His Excellency handed mo an aide-memoire involving certain changes in tho present Administration in syria.   He said that similar copies wore, handed- to tho representativesof France, America and Italy.     I understood fr^m tho correspondencefind interviews which onsued that thS^nxdo-memoire was not basedon an agreement between Groat Britain and any other Power, but it issimply a statement showing tho decision of Groat Britain taken fopreasons of economy as to tho withdrawal of her troops from certainArrb Provinces.   Tho whole question is supposed to bo a provisionalmilitary arrangement, neither administrative nor political, taken fortho maintenance of order until tho final decision of tho PeacoConference as to tho future government of the country.Hrving crrefully read this document rnd having closely obsorvedtho general&quot;situation In tho Arab Provinces since tho Tronty of Trucowas signed vith Turkey (and rs y ou know I r.m in a go^d position tojud.go of the affairs of my country,) I came to tho conclusion thattho&apos; execution of this project would not ^nly entail disagreement withthe rights of nations but would also bo detrimental t^ the interestsof the country and my people, and destructive to public peace through-out the East.   I r,m persuaded that tho Great Powers with interestsin tho Erst, will suffer harm in proportion to their respectiveinterests.   The two Powers enn not have boon aware of tho troubleswhich may arise from any Alteration In the status-quo establishedsince tho occupation) for this agreement will altor tho provisionaladministration established since the occupation without making r.nysuitable an&amp;ngcment in lieu of it,then the British Government informed mo of this plan, which thoycrlled a &quot;suggested project&quot; based      tho Sykos-PIcot Treaty of 1916,I protested and put on record my reasons for so doing.     The BritishGovernment, having -realised the gravity of the situation, accepted theproposal to appoint a Committee of American, British, French and Arabdelegates to consider the questions involved In the i mpending ovacua-tion and t^ establish a unified provisional Administration t^ takethe place of the present regime.     When, however the proposal was referred to tho French Government, I was informed by Lord Curzon ,Minister of Foreign Affairs, that M.Clemonceau did not approve thesuggestion ond expressed the desire to coo me in Pr*ris.   Furthermore,the French Government also refused to agree, as they informed mothemselves, to the British proposal except in regard to tho evacuation of British troops on November 1st.   Tho two Governments, consideringexclusively their &quot;nvn Interests In the question, have not given fullconsidorrtIon to tho effect it will have on the Syrian people.   As Inm responsible for the safety and welfare of my country, I havesimilarly Informed the French Government of the reasons f^r my inability to agree to the arrangement? and again proposed a mixed commission.The French Premier In his reply declines to accept any of rry proposalsbecause ho says that he ennnot go against a decision tr-kon by thoSupremo Council, adding that French troops arc ready to maintainorder in their zone and to assist mo to do the same in my mm districton my first call,   I boliavo that M.Clemenceau Is under the impression
that tho movement of which wo are afraid will be duo to &quot;agitators&quot;and not a spontaneous outburst of national fooling,   I doubt ifthe Supreme Council and public opinion-throughout tho civilizedworld would approve of suppress .ve measures against perfectly leg-itimate national movements that could only result in bloodshed.The Supreme.Council, I understand,,has taken no decision in thomatter, having merely &quot;noted&apos;1 the fact of the agreement, onSeptember 15, 1919f as communicated to no b&quot; the French Government.The Council presumably believed, that the irag.&apos;communicated project wassimply to relieve troops and did not entail any political or administrative change in&apos;the occupied enemy territory now adminis-torod in the name of the Allies0   It, is clear, therefore, that the&quot;suggested project&quot; was not. approved by the authorities concerned,and should therefore be given fresh consideration and c^scussionby tho Supreme Council,   I beg herewith,, to briefly expose someof the principal reasons for my objections to the proposal whichwill plunge the people into despair as to their future.1.   I find it difficult to understand that the project is a purely military ono?   It seems to me that it contains many economic andpolitical points that should only bo decided by the Peace Conference.-The fact of taking away tho supreme power of administration from asingle head and tho division of the country into throe differentzones, each reporting to a separate Government and acting through adifferent system, is surely a very Important change in tho present administration end cannot be called a military measure.   Such mattersa3 the railway arrangements and zones of influence oto, etc. do not come within the measures to be taken for tho preservation of order,until a final settlement of the Syrian Question by tho Peace Con-ference.2fl   According to the proposed arrangements the Arab Provinces arcto be divided into three districtsf ono under British administration,another under French and the third under the Arab Government,   Thisis to&apos; say that the Syrian Nation, which has always been looking forward, to a unity of administration, is now to bo split up and eachpart put under a&apos; separate Government*   The harm resulting therefromis a deadly blow to tho country,,   Dissension between tho inhabitants -of different districts, possibly fostered and encouragoci by ignor-ant officials, or even competition between different administrators;will increase and thereby neutralize any benefits which might havocone through ono distinct aclminictratione   Troubles will begin ontho frontiers and wll], spread into the heart of the country.Furthermore^ that portion left to the Arab Government isst id to be an independent Aral!) Province, but is again divided intodifferent zones of influence, one under the British end the otherunder the French,   Any assistance required for one of these twosub-divisions should be asked for from the Power which exercisesinfluence over it,   Has ever a nation in the&apos;history of the worldbeen able to make any progress under such obstructive circumstancesiThis arrangement will undoubtedly dishearten the people and createdisaffection among them.   They will feel distrust of the Allies andwill do everything in their power to defend the unity of theircountry.   They arc a weak nation and they will bo unable to resistfor long, but they will nevertheless meet death for their justcause,   Who will then be responsible before the civilized worldfor such a sacrifice ?   Ho one can persuade the /people of thocountry that they are wrong 1^ their fixed ideas.   Everyone who he a&quot;heOi experience of the prevailing feeling amongst tbo people cansa^/ that public order can never be maintained without bloodshedg3,   The withdrawal of British troops is proposed to be made on aruling which is not recognised by the Arabs nor by the UnitedStates Government, who declared on entering the war that theywould not recognise any secret agreement.   I rcf^r to the
Sykos-Plcot agreement of 1916, which dealt with the country as if it-vore a private estato or a mere parcel of goods, at a time when her youngrun -tore pouring from Syria to tho desert and &quot;offering their lives for for independence.    Any action based on a ruling not recognized by tho(Mrco Conference cannot bo executed without a 6pecif?l discussion fromthat Conference.4.    Tho Commandor-in-Chief, when the Allied troops occupied Syria,ordered me to withdraw    my agents from tho coast, and mr.de a declaration to tho Syrian people that ho proposed to occupy tho country and establishr; unified Oovornment in tho namo of tho Allies.    His administrationthus formed would remain active until such time as the Peace Conferencegrvo its last decision.    Tho Syrians considered this declaration as a pledge given by tho Allies, and their country as being placed as a trustin tho hnnds of the Oommrnder-tn^Chiqf, acting on behrlf of the Allies,pnd establishing one single administration which ho promised to maintainas above stnted*     t take it that no change in the fundamental basis ofthis arrangement can bo made before the propor timo comos or beforemother administration basod on the same principles is ostablishode   GroritBritnin recognizes this pledge, but says it was not anticipated that such along delay would pass before such a decision should be taken by the conference.    Is this delay the fault of tho Arab Syrian Nation, or have wecommitted any disloyalty which deserved such a punishment?    V&apos;e havo alwayssbown complete loyalty to tho Allies, ever since wo rose against the Turks,and the least wo expect is the fulfilment of a promise given by the-     c Commander-in-Ohiof.5t      Tho over-excited fooling now prevailing in the Arab Provinces, asveil as nil othor Moslem Provinces ot the Ottoman Empire in Asiar causedisp inly by unwise ford g  interference, is no longer a secret.    Any personhaving tho slightest knowledge of what has been going on in the Syrianprovince, is undoubtedly convinced that there will be trouble, and in manyplainsf if the status-quo of the present Administration is changodoI9 therefore, bog you in tho namo of humanity and th.e J ntorcsis ofpeaces in the name of tho Arab Nation and In tho nrmo of the multitudinousinterests of France, Italy, Broat Britain and America, in the Eastern World,tbnt no new doors bo opened for further troubles of which wo all may seetho beginning but of which tho ond cannot bo foretold.     The incidents of .Smyrna and other places are still fresh in our memory.I very much foar that tho mischief will spread throughout the Moslemfor-Xdo     Tho people will think that there is a definite intention topersecute l3lam.    You may still romomber that tho rising of the Arabs,leaded by my father, the King, has given tho first blow against tho hatedprinciple of fanaticism.      The Arabs attacked the Moslem Turks because i-bey woro oppressors and Joined the Allies believing that they wore fight- -ing for right and justice irrespective of religion.   I personally through^)ut tho war.   havo been fighting fanaticism at every time and place * , Arabs-fithcred around me from every direction nnd every religion.     Our unityms notional and not religious.   A greot number of men who are working1th me now in this national cause do- not belong t^ my rcligione     this list prove to you how distressed I shall be If this high ideal is debasedo religious conflict through misunderstanding, mismanagement pnd imprudence..You must agree with mo thrt it is in tho interests of all to preserveho utmost trnnauility during tho short period of time previous to theinal decision of the Porco Conference; rather thrn cause trouble to occur 1pr no logical reason.   I am therefore of tho opinion that the Great PowersMuld bo informed of tho serious situation as we know it so that immediate(tops bo tr.ken for the interested Allied Powers nnd broth ren in arms tohnsider tho interests of each Government according to tho idesl of justicelor which, we have fought together.
I conclude by emphasizing my request to be allowed to lay in person a full statement of my case, which touches my country more closely than it does any other, for it will be on me and my people that the results of any action whether for good or evil, will fall.
