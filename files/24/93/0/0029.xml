&quot;;.. THE CABINET.RUSSIAN POLICY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The House of Commons has voted assistance to General Denikin up till the 014931st March, 1920, and I assume there is no intention to go back on that decision. TheHouse has also been informed that no British negotiations will be entered upon withthe Bolsheviks before Parliament has had an opportunity of discussing such a proposal.Thirdly, the winter in Russia has now begun, and it is believed that the Bolshevikswill have grave difficulties in living through it. The navigation of the Volga is alreadyreported to be closed, and if Denikin can maintain his general front Bolshevik russia is, to a very great extent, cut off from food, coal and oil.During these ensuing months, therefore, Denikin will be receiving ample supplies which will enable him to increase his armies He has plenty of food and fuel. Providedwe help him organize his interior situation on sound economic and political lines, heshould at the very least come through the winter better than his enemy. The accession to his forces of the Galician Ruthenes (two on a division) should enable him tostraighten his front towards the north and west, not only by these new troops but byhis own troops who have been opposing them. His army is reported, according tothe latest information, as consisting of 240,000 bayonets and sabres, and 7U,000artillery, aviation, tanks, &amp;c. He has 74 tanks in the country, the Russian personnel for handling which has now been fully trained. Of these only about a dozen have yet been used on the fighting fronts. The freezing of the volga removes the dangerof the Bolsheviks, even if they take Tsaritsin, obtaining the command of the CaspianSea before Apiil.Here in the south of Russia we have a very great and important military entitywhich has been called into being by the policy arid at the expense of the BritishGovernment with the full approval of their parliamentary supporters. We have no intention of withdrawing the succour from Denikin which he has been promised, and itis obvious that our supporters in Parliament will expect to see the policy to which their approval has been so readily given sustained with earnestness and resolution, sothat it shall have the best possible chance of yielding solid and lasting results.Denikins fortunes will, however, be jeopardized, if not cast away, unless a strenuouseffort is made on all other Russian fronts in harmony and consistency with our support ofDenikin. We shall utterly stultify ourselves if we can be shown to have been spendingpublic money and encouraging national energies to secure one objective in the Southwhile in the West and in the North-West and in the Far East we are either pursuingdifferent objectives or manifesting a helpless indifference to the course of events.Further, the dangerous situation which is increasingly developing in South Caucasia, in .Trans-Caspia, in Turkestan, on the borders of Afghanistan and on the borders of Persiamay ripen rapidly into a purely British peril of direct and high importance.The Cabinet has invited me to set down the actual steps which I now ask shouldbe taken on the other fronts to make the Denikin enterprise, to whieh we have committed ourselves, a success. I therefore make the following proposals with a greatsense of the difficulties of the problem and an earnest appeal to my colleagues to helpin overcoming them : 1. North Russia. A ship of war should visit North Russia once or twice duringthe winter in order, if necessary, to encourage the resistance of the North RussianGovernment; and a certain supply of food, if possible obtained from Denikin, should,as originally proposed by Lord Rawlinson, be sent into Murmansk about January.2. Finland, Yudenitch, the Baltic States and Poland. We should definitelyand immediately inform Finland that we earnestly desire her to take Petrograd. Weshould promise her supplies of munitions from our enormous surpluses. We shouldactively undertake mediation between her and Kolchak, Denikin and the Paris Russians,to secure a satisfactory adjustment of her Pechenga and Karelia claims. We shouldtell the Russians simultaneously of the appeal and offer we have made to Finland, andmThis document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.
-counsel them in the present grave situation of affairs to come to an agreement. Weshould ask France to join us in this appeal and in this policy. There is every reason tobelieve she would be ready to do so within the limits proposed.We should undertake, either separately ourselves or jointly with France, mediationbetween the Esthonians, Latvians and Lithuanians on the one hand, and the Kolchak Denikin-Paris Russians on the other. We should urge on both parties the immenseimportance of maintaining the North-West Russian front till the winter pressure hasmade itself felt upon the Bolshevik Government. To the Russians we can point out thedanger to Denikin resulting from the collapse of this front. To the Baltic States wecan point out the favourable opportunity, which may never recur, of making good terms for their future, under the auspices of the great Powers, with the National Russians,and the dubious value of any title deeds obtained at this stage from the Bolsheviks.Again we should offer surplus arms and stores, our supplies of which have been recentlygreatly increased by the reduction in the reserves to be retained in the United kingdom from a 30 to a 20 division basis. Our proposal to both parties should be the formation ofan autonomous federal State comprising Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania, within the limits of a reconstituted Russia. The agreement, if reached, should be under the safeguard-of the League of Nations. Although this solution is not all the Baltic States desire,where else are they going to get so good a title deed ? Anyhow, pending thenegotiations, we should urge them to maintain the front and not to conclude a peacewith the Bolsheviks which would enable enemy forces to be withdrawn from then-sector. Every week gained in preventing this front from collapsing may be of decisiveimportance to Denikin, and consequently to the whole problem.We should energetically press the French to accelerate the supply of arms and munitions and other military materiel to Poland, which country is one of the keystonesof the Entente policy, whether as regards. Bolshevism or Germany. It should be putplainly to the French that this is the sphere they have chosen for themselves, that weare doing our share in other directions, and that if they fail in their self-chosen taskthe responsibility will be nakedly theirs. Needless to say, I have not attempted tosuggest the language in which these representations should be couched. Together withthe French, we should address a strong note to Poland, urging her to maintain her frontagainst the Bolsheviks, even though there is no necessity for her to make any seriousadvance. My information, derived from some authoritative sources in France, is that,once the elections are over, a more active policy against the Bolsheviks will be possible.We should test this to the full as soon as the results are known.3. The German intrigue in Gourland. As a part of a genuine anti-Bolshevikpolicy, it would be right to put the strongest pressure on the Germans to quit Courlandas an armed force and to disentangle the Russian troops who are camouflaging theGerman ambitions there. This will not be done without force. As it is an integral part of the Great War, we and the French ought to supply force jointly. If it is decided that in no circumstances can force be used locally, we must accept the fact thatthe solution of the Baltic problem,will fall to German hands. When General Hakingreturns in a few days, he will be in a position to advise as to the amount of forcerequired. As a part and parcel of a general scheme of raising up old maintaining an active front against the Bolsheviks, it should be possible to detach many of the BermontRussians from their German backers. On the other hand, if we are not going to help the Russians to beat the Bolsheviks, we ought not to conceal from ourselves thatpreventing the Germans from doing so is a move purely pro-Bolshevik in its effects.The difficulties which have arisen in the Baltic States are complicated in the lastdegree. This is entirely due to the fact that no policy has been pursued by the greatvictorious Powers, except that of Jetting various weak and desperate forces tumbleover one another in confusion, in the hopes that something may turn up which willrelieve us of our embarrassments. I must again point out that doing nothing in thissphere, except letting things slide, or issuing futile ultimatums, does not mean avoidingtrouble and expense. It only means that in a few months, having thrown away everyfriend or potential friend, we shall be confronted with a formidable and thoroughlyGermanized situation, and that the Germans may be in a position to exploit thesituation either in a Bolshevik or an anti-Bolshevik direction, according to circumstances.I wish, however, to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the grave danger which is developing in this quarter.4. Roumania. Our policy should be to urge Roumania to endeavour to cometo terms with Denikin and Kolchak about Bessarabia in return for giving effective help
against the Bolsheviks, and withdrawing all countenance from Petlura. Matters arenot. however, going badly in this part of the  eld at the present time.5. With regard to Denikin, the great thing is to organize bis rear, and I am inentire agreement with the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on thissubject. This implies an earnest effort (a) to mobilize all the existing Russian financial resources commanded by Monsieurs Jaroszynski, Bark and others, and to encourage the-co-operation of British firms and capitalists: (b) to give effective aid in reforming the currency: (c) pacification and temporizing measures to prevent collisions betweenDenikin&apos;s forces and the Caucasian Republic. These also are making progress on bothsides, and will be helped by Mr. Mackiuders arrival.6. Siberia. We should appeal, if possible in conjunction with -France, to bothAmerica and Japan, jointly and severally, to exert themsel ves to avert the collapse ofthe Siberian front and the consequent over-running of the country right up to LakeBiikal. A single Japanese Division would restore the whole situation. Is there nomeans by which we can induce the Japanese to act, or induce the Americans to join with us in asking them to act ? No genuine effort has been made at present, In JuneAdmiral Kolchak had grounds for hoping that if his answers to the five Great powers were satisfactory, his Government would be recognized. The moral effect of this wouldhave been enormous. His answers were satisfactory, but, instead of being recognized,lie was promised a continuance of support. Since that time all that has happened isthat the British have withdrawn their troops and have cut off all supplies. The french have done nothing. The Americans have sold a certain quantity of munitions toKolchak for actual gold. The Japanese have intrigued with Semenof, and are simplydigging their talons deep in that part of the country they are reserving for themselves.The letter signed by the Heads of five great victorious Powers has not, therefore, beenmade good. Yet the anxieties of the Japanese are powerfully excited by the prospect of bolshevism approaching China and by the probabilities of serious risings against themeast of Lake Baikal in the event of a collapse at Omsk. These would necessitate afurther reinforcement of Japanese forces. The Americans also have been perturbed bythe increasing danger of a Siberian collapse, and their representatives on the spot are pressing For further immediate aid to the Siberian Government. An appeal to Americaand Japan for an emergency effort, not as an isolated feature hut as part of a generalpolicy for the holding up of the Bolshevik&apos; fronts during the winter months, would notnecessarily be foredoomed to failure.   At least it should be&apos; tried.The last resource in this quarter is the Czechs. The strongest pressure should beput upon the Czecho-Slovak Government to urge their troops, in whole or in part, toco-operate in maintaining the front, or at the very least to remain guarding the sector of the Siberian railroad, until the result of the winter pressure is known.Lastly, in this survey of Russian fronts I must refer to what is rapidly becoming aBritish front. The Bolsheviks have already obtained access to Turkestan. The furtherretirement of Kolchak and the probable, fall of Omsk and break-up of the Siberianarmies will leave them without a rival in these immense regions. They are in touchin the Caucasus with the Turkish nationalists, and obviously Bolsheviks and Turkishnationalists have common interests and a common foe, viz., Great Britain. TheBolsheviks are intriguing with Afghanistan, trying to induce her to join in an anti-British campaign. Obviously again there is enough loot in these countries to satisfyboth Bolshevik and Afghan ambitions so long as they will combine against the commonfoe, viz., Great Britain. The Bolsheviks are overrunning Transcaspia. Already theyapproach the frontiers of Persia. Their agitation proceeds in advance of theirarmies. We have very few troops in Persia. What are our responsibilities?What are our means of discharging those responsibilities ? Have we any -intention of making exertions to prevent Persia from being overrun by theBolsheviks, or do we intend to allow this whole kingdom to join the general welterof anarchy ? Further, a rapprochement is beginning between the Turkish nationalistsand the Arabs. The exasperation of the Turks at the Greek invasion of Smyrna, thefury of the Arabs . at the impending French occupation of Syria: will probablylead these two elements, on whose division our policy during the war has been based,to fuze together. This will re-act on Mesopotamia, hampering all our schemes formilitary reduction. Every attempt open to the Bolsheviks is being made to corruptthe loyalty of India. At the same time we have had to proclaim to Parliament our intention to reduce our military forces to practically a pre-war level.In the face of all these dangers, and tendencies more dangerous still, what are wegoing to do ?   Are we going to try to defend our interests in all these great Asiatic
regions locally and separately with British and Indian troops ? If so, we are going tobe involved in great and prolonged exertions and almost indefinite expense. On theother hand, a blow at the heart of the whole of these evils, namely, the capitals of theSoviet Power, will cut off from the very centre-spring the flow of dangers. Andthis can be done not by emplojdng British and Indian troops, but with Firms,Esthonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Yudenitch Russians, Bermont Russians, Poles,Czecho-Slovaks, Galician Ruthenes, possibly Roumanians, with Denikin&apos;s armies, and,far off, with Siberian armies. If we do not use the anti-Bolshevik forces to crush theBolshevik movement, the danger will present itself to us alone after all these forces have been dispersed or squandered, and we shall have to use our own flesh and blood,and spend far greater quantities of our own money, without any of the hopes of asatisfactory solution which are now within our reach.1. The above proposals are, of course, only attempts to show in what manner asincere &quot; will to win &quot; would manifest itself in our conduct of Russian policy. If wehad tried to do all these things and had not succeeded, or in spite of having succeededhad not achieved our aim, we should at any rate be able to show that we have done allin human power. We have no right to make any such claim at the present time.I therefore sum up the heads under which action should be taken, as follows : (1.) Keep in touch navally with Murmansk.(2.) Make Finland take Petrograd.(3.) Retard the peace negotiations of the three Baltic States by mediating betwecmthem and the National Russians and by the supply of arms, &amp;c.(4.) Expel the Germans from Courland and get the Russian elements in German,pay to join Yudenitch&apos;s army.(5.) Retain a naval force in the Baltic.(6.) Stimulate the Polish resistance.(7.) Urge the Czecho-Slovak Government to order their Siberian Czechs to helpKolchak.(8.) Plelp to organize Denikin&apos;s rear economically and politically.(9.) Press most strongly the United States and Japan, jointly or severally, to avertthe Omsk collapse.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL...12th November, 1919.
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)PROPOSED CAMPAIGN FOR THE MULTIPLICATIONOF TRADE BOARDS,secret.P.T^9* (Memorandum by tho Minister.of Labour)t(1) There are in existence at the moment in Great Britain24 Trade Boards.   I regard It as urgently necessary for reasons indicated bolow to establish new Trade Boards, tothe number of about 100, in the next twelve months in the----   trades of which a list is attachedc   I understand that theTreasury regards this extension as one of principlerequiring the approval of the Cabinet.(2) The reasons which lead mo to this conclusion are(a) tho experience of tho Ministry of Labour in respectof the existing Boards.   Viewed at theirinitiation with suspicion - by employers as a wage-raising institution and by the large TradeUnions as tending to fix maxima - the trade boards have been increasingly welcomed by bothsides, more particularly since the passage of theTrade Boards Act 1918, which widened the field inwhich Boards could bo established.-   The department is constantly being pressed by both sides toestablish new Boards.   Thus, in the last few days the Employers1 side of the Leather Goods Trade andthe employees  side r.f the Catering Trade have asked for the immediate establishment of Boards.(b) The Trades potentially covered by Trade Boardsinclude a very large proportion of the employed &apos;population.   The settlement of wages over so widea field will be an instrument of increasing
