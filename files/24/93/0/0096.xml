if &apos; - til I &amp;x*$***t(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GfOVERNMRNT, secret. p C A B I,,N E T.0.?.192. )       REFUGEE CAMPS AT PORT SAID.AMD BAQ.tT.AH, 1% MESOPOTAMIA....i circulate U my colleagues a memorandum which has beenprepared in the Foreign Office, in reply to the Memorandum(Hoi C.paOS) circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequeroh the Ilth November,(initialled)      of K-.24th N*november.1*      The present position as regards the camps themselves isas fallowsA) Port Said..G.E.Q. Egypt reported recently that this camp :,raspractically cleared.It is intended to transfer the equipment etc. of the campto cilicia, in accordance with an agreement with the French,by which they consented to receive there the Armenians fromthe Aleppa district, in order to- avsid the possibility ofdiscrder.cn our withdrawal.In view of this, no further expenses need be incurred inconnecticn with the Port Said camp.B) Baqubah..,It has been suggested that the French Government should:-I.-   Receive 12,000 Armenians into Cilicia from Baqubah.(The total number of refugges In the camp is from 40,000 to 50,030)2.   That they should meet, a share of the total expenses ofthe camp.It is considered useless to ask the French Government to accede to the first utt these suggestions, but the second is being put forward with somewhat slight hopes of successaFith regard tc the definite suggestions for effectingeconomies contained in the last four paras. of sr, Chamberlain1Smemorandum, it may be noted that:-A) Repatriation to Urumia, whence a considerable proportionrff the refugees at Baqubah come, is at present impracticablewithout the provision of a strong military escort,, owing to thefact that In order to reach their homes, the refugees would haveto pass through areas inhabited by hostile elements, who would,in all probability, oppose their repatriation by force *B) The settlement of some of the refugees in a ,rreservationat Amadia, is already in progress. A second area for repatriationhas also been suggested, but as it lies outside the limits of theI Mosul Vilayet,  and thus beyond the sphere of allied military occupation, no decision can be taken with regard to it, pending a decision of the Peace Conference as to frontiers.,.
C)   It is understood that steps have already beentaken to ensure that those refugees who -are physically fitshall be employed in-useful work.2.      With regard to the suggestion that the Ft&apos;)   should bemade financially responsible for ihe camp, at Baqubah, such acourse is, in the view of the Foreign Office, open toinsurmountable objections. &apos;The F.O., has no experience of this type of administration and no staff available to undertake such a task.Unless jthereibr-j,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs could supply an entirely new administration undersuitable officials wlth the necessary experience (a condition-impossible of fulfilment) it ^ould be necessary for himto employ in the main existing officials, at their present rate of salary, with the result that no appreciable economy- &apos;would be effected, while It would be manifestly undesirable for the F.O. tc be financially responsible for an erganisationover which It could not exercise effective control,   thealternative, of inviting the Government of India to undertake the administration at the F.ors expense, would&apos; hardly resultIn the effecting of economies,   .since past experience has proved, as for example in the case- of the Consular eatablishmenin Persia, that the Government of India generally maintainsmore elaborate establishments, and pays higher salaries th&amp;uare assigned to F.&quot;). officials abroad.In view of the above, the Kf\ Is very strongly In favourof the adoption of the first of the alternatives suggestedby Mr. Chamberlain, namely, that the cost of maintenance ofsuch refugees -as can neither be repatriated, ncr transferredto areas under the control, of the French should be chargeddirectly against Army funds.   It is understood that theorganisation is now in military ,hands, -aid It,would seem thata change of administration would be unlikely to tend eithertocards economy or efficiency.
