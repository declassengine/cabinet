Malleson wires 8th November, repeating  Baghdad, Constantinople,ran and Kasvin :-&quot; Bolshevik designs in regard to Persia. A bait formerly closely identified withBolsheviks, still working with them, but actually now in employ of Amir of Bokhara,informed one of my confidential Agents in Merv on 31st October : &quot;1. Object of mission of Afghans and Kazim Beg-to Moscow is to bring aboutBolshevik-Mahometan solidity throughout Asia and ruin the British Empire bydestroying its power in the Near and Middle East.&quot;2. Programme to be discussed at Moscow consisted in.the first place of plans to win over Persia to Bolshevik and pan-Islam side by means of peaceful propaganda.Emissaries are to be sent to Persian Democrats and all others disaffected towardspresent regime. It was hoped by these means to coerce the Shah/s Government intoannulling recent Anglo-Persian treaty, establishing really democratic regime and sobringing Persia definitely into Bolshevik orbit without recourse to arms. When this had become fait accompli the necessary further steps for ejectment of British fromAsia would be taken.&quot; 3. Should above method fail in gaining over Persia a large army, not less than150,000 strong, composed of Bolsheviks, Afghans, Central Asia Mahometans and chinese mercenaries would invade Persia and establish Bolshevik rule. Simul-taneously and co-ordinated with the above, Afghans and frontier tribes to invadeIndia, whilst Turkey would foment rising in Kurdistan and Persia Azerbaijan, forwhich plans, matured by Turkish regular officers, are now in preparation.&quot;4-. Above is quite possibly accurate description of enemy designs. It&apos;tallieswith Kaziin Beg&apos;s constant announcements. To what extent programme was endorsedat Moscow remains to be seen.&quot; 5. According to telegram from Bajgiran to-day Kazim Beg had returned toAskabad. If this is correct we may expect intense propaganda in Persia in near-future.&quot;
