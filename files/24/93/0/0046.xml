MR. C. LON HUR$T.^ ^&apos;&apos;t&apos;h jcj nnr-nmput Is the ^Property cCONTOENTIA!   - ^B;i N r^3ESfRIS0HMBNT 0? SIMM WXH PRISONERS IK : ENGLAND.      * &apos; &apos;0  \\ (Circulated by the Home Secretary).The Home Secretary submits to the Cabinet certain questions that arise ona proposal made by the Irish Government for the transfer of certain Sinn Peinprisoners from Irish prisons to English prisons.In February last the Irish Government proposed the transfer to England ofabout 100 oonvioted prisoners, but the difficulties connected with treatment in english prisons - and in particular the difficulty involved in allowing speoialconcessions to some of them - were so great that the Home Secretary was unable toassent to the transfer.In May the Irish Government proposed the transfer of two prisonerssentenced by Court Martialt for cffenoes against D.R.R., to 2 years imprisonment,in one case with and in one without Hard Labour.The Home Seoretary agreed to the transfer and the prisoners were treated asFirst Division Prisoners.In September the Irish Government proposed the transfer of six oonvicts,Sinn Feiners, who had been sentenced by Court Martial to Penal Servitude for breaches of D.R.R., writing as followsi-&quot;These men demanded to be treated as political1 prisoners and to begranted the ameliorations of prison treatment which have been sanctioned for prisoners other than oonvicts undergoing imprisonment for breaches of theRegulations?   but as these convicts&apos; demands could not be entertained, theyhave beoome insubordinate, refusing to work and, when punished for their refusal in aooordanoe with the Prison Rules, divesting themselves of theirclothes in their cells, and shouting, singing, and hammering on their oelldoors during the night to the serious disoomfort of the other prisoners whocomplain of being unable to sleep and ask that their prison life may not bemade intolerable by such behaviour on the part of these Sinn Fein. Convicts&quot;.After discussion of the difficulties in the way cf acceding to this requesta reply was sent to the Irish Offioe on 6th Ootober as fellows:-nWith reference to your letter of the 18th September, I am direoted bythe Seoretary of State to say, that having had the advantage of discussingpersonally trith the Lord Lieutenant the question of removing Irish prisoners to English prisons, he is still of opinion that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of receiving Sinn Fein prisoners in an English prisonwhere other prisoners are serving their sentences, but he is prepared to giveeffeot to the suggestion which he made to Lord Frenoh - that Hie Majesty1sPrison at Chelmsford, now unoccupied, should be set aside for the detention ofany prisoners whom the Irish Bovernment may wish to remove from Irelandbeing either men convicted by Court Martial and under sentence of penal servitude or imprisonment, or interned as Sinn Feiners without a oonviction,provided that (l) all prisoners removed there will be. Bubjeot to the same treatment;   that (2) no other persons than the prisoners above-mentioned will
m  2  &quot;*be received from Ireland in English prisons;   and,that (3) before anyprisoners are sent to Chelmsford Prison for custody the Irish Governmentwill set out in detail the regulations which they would wish laid down fortheir treatment, making it clear whether they are to be regarded ascriminal prisoners or merely as persons who have been interned for thepublic safety.    The regulations should in particular preBOribe whatconcessions should be made in regard to letters, visits, books and parcels.It will further be necessary that &amp; military guard should be provided atthe prison to deal with concerted mutiny, or attempted rescue or escape.,and that it should be definitely settled what treatment shotild be accorded to &quot;hunger-strikers&apos;J   these are matters *n whith the decision of theCabinet should be obtained before any removal of Irish prisoners oan takeplace.    I am to ask that, you will move His Excellency to inform IvSr. Shorttat his earliest convenience whether he desires to take advantage of this offer in order that preparations for carrying it into effect may be made without delay&quot; *The Irish Government replied on the 2?.rd October accepting the offer,approving Regulations as in the copy annexed and saying&quot;His Excellency concurs with the Secretary of State that all prisonersoommitted to chelmsford Prison from Ireland should be treated alikewhether they have been convicted by Court Hartial and sentenced to termsof penal servitude or imprisonment or are merely interned without a conviction under Regulation MB of the Defence of the Realm Regulations;and further, that no persons other than prisoners of the above-mentionedclassifications will be transferred from Ireland to ChelmBford Prison.His Excellency agrees that a Lilitary Guard for Chelmsford Prisonwould appear to be advisable as Irish prisoners and internees are not unlikely to resort to munity or to attempts to escape.As regards the question of the treatment of 1 hunger-strikers1 I haveto say that on the 7th Harch, 1918. the following printed notice was. bydirections of the Irish Government, posted up in Irish Prisons in whiohD.O.R.A. prisoners were confinedf-&apos;A11 persons committed to prison are informed that, they will not beable by wilful injury to their bodily health oaused by refusal of foodor in any other way, to procure their release before their discharge inthe ordinary course&apos;.It v;ould appear to His Excellency to be desirable that a similarnotice should be printed and posted up in every oell in Chelmsford Prison&quot;,The following questions are now submitted for the consideration of theCabinet?- ,1* Treatment of Hunger-Strikers.If, as proposed by the Irish Government, the prisoners in question aregiven notice that they will not be able to procure their release by&apos;hunger-striking, the Secretary of State considers it necessary to maintain such apolicy inflexibly to the end, with the result that, if forcible feedingbecomes impracticable, a prisoner will be allowed to starve himself to death.
In individual oases forcible feeding may be continued over a ltng period in prisons as well as in Lunatic Asylums, without any question arising of the prisoners release, but in some oases (e.g. prisoners with weak hearts) forcecannot be applied at all for the purpose without a grave risk of its causingdeaths   and again, if a considerable number of determined prisoners combinedto refuse food) it might be impossible to find the medical staff necessary forfeeding them compulsorily.    All that could then be done would be to supply thereoaloitrant prisoners with suitable food and to leave them to take it or not asthey prefer.    Such a contingency is possible^ and even probable, in the caseof Sinn Feiners and has to be faced.YUiile it is undoubtedly the duty of the PriBon Authorities * as laid down inLeigh v. Gladstone,- to do what they can to preserve the health and lives of the prisoners committed to their custody, this cannot put on them the duty of usingforce for the purpose if there is a distinct risk of the prisoners death beingcaused thereby.Further, Medical Officers of Prisons have in the past declined and mightagain decline to take part in feeding a sane prisoner by force - a proceedingwhich is of course wholly alien from the usual duties a Medical Officer under-takes*    In that event no outside medical man would undertake the work and itcan scarcely be the duty of the Governor of a prison to undertake the forciblefeeding of a prisoner without medical assistance, and his only alternative wouldbe to supply the prisoner with suitable food and leave him to take it or refuseit as he chaoses.Cases can easily be supposed (e.g. that of a man convicted of attemptedmurder who has expressed his intention to renew the attempt) in which it wouldbe undoubtedly wrong to allow the prisoners discharge on the ground of hiscontinued refusal to take food.      The question is whether,,if the occasion arises, the Sinn Fein prisoners are to be so treated.    If the Government sodecides $ the Home Secretary considers that not only should the/notice above-mentioned be placed in their cells, but that as 300h as they are received inChelmsford prison they should be informed in the most emphatic manner possiblethat it is the unalterable intention of the Government to oarry it into effect.He thinks it possible that an intimation to this effect might be of advantagem general grounds as a chock to hunger-strikes.    Hunger-strikes are of recentgrowth and might oause in future cases more serious trouble than they have caused hitherto, unless met by a clear and firm policy.He understands, however, that in Ireland, in spite of the exhibition of thenotice set out above, many Sinn Fein prisoners have been released after hunger-striking.     If the same course is to be followed eventually in England the HomeSecretary oould not consent to posting up this notice at all.    Apart from thecontempt into whioh the administration would be brought by such a course, thereis the difficulty that the Sinn Fein prisoners would be&apos; discharged in England,unable to travel home, but able, on recovery, to do much mischief.The only case in which a class of prisoners has been released, withoutforoible feeding, after hunger-striking, is that of certain Conscientious
Objectors released after it had become clear that a general amnesty could notbe long delayed.    Their case is entirely different from that of sinn feiners, and, moreover, the practice of releasing them was net announced andwas not in operation Jong enough to become generally known.The Sinn Feiners hare a common motive, are inspired-by fanaticism,: and can. while in association, resolve upon and execute a concerted policy.Experience in the case of the Suffragettes and the Conscientious Objectorsshows that bodies of prisoners so inspired, even when not allowed, freeassociation, cannot be successfully dealt with by forcible feeding.    In thelong run it has been found necessary to discharge many of them, often in acondition which shocks public opinion and provokes attack In Parliament, andall that has been accomplished by forcible feeling in these cases is &quot;to delay the date of discharge.Further, it would almost certainly be found impossible, if the sinn feiners were released under the ?Cat and Mouse&quot; Act, to enforce the conditionsof their release and to bring the;&quot;, back to prison on the expiration of theperi-id of release.Unless, therefore, the Government are prepared to allow Sinn Feinersto be released as soon as they have starved themselves for a few days or, incertain cases after a period of forcible feeding, the only alternative isthe detention of Sinn Fein hunger strikers, with or without forcible feedingas circumstances (i.e. the health of Individual prisoners and the extent towhich a hunger-strike may be carried) may dictate, to the point of death, ifnecessary.    The Secretary of State desires to knew whether the Cabinet isprepared to adopt this course and to make it known as the settled policy ofHis Lajesty&apos;s Government.II. Military Guard.The Prison Commissioners cannot undertake responsibility for the custody of these prisoners and for dealing with attempts to escape unless a strongmilitary guard be stationed at each prison.      Under the proposed, regulationsthe prisoners will have daily opportunities of concerting plans for escape,and they are inspired by a common motive, common zeal, and common nationality;and ideals.    Outside the prisons they have well organised, influential andwealthy friends to inspire or seoond attempts at escape.    It is. absolutely-essential that strong guards should be provided, and this is beyond the capacity of the limited Prison Staff.If, therefore, these men are to be kept in an English Prison, the HomeSecretary desires the Cabinet to direct the employment of a Military Guardstrong enough to meet the Prison Commissioners1 requirements and to give thenecessary instructions to the Army Council who.will naturally be reluctant   &apos;on military grounds te spare soldiers for this purpose.III. Enforcement of Discipline.There are two, difficulties in the way of enforcing, on convictedprisoners and internees alike, the common code of Regulations proposed by
m  5  *the Irish Government%     (l) As regards convicted prisoners in England, discipline is ordinarilyimposed and punishments prescribed by Statute md Statutory Rules;   the discipline^and punishments are not the same for conviots under penal servitude and for prisoners under sentence of imprisonment; - and there is no express legalauthority either for according to them as well as to 1 internees&apos;, the ameliorative-tions given by the proposed regulations or imposing 6n the two olassec a commondiscipline and common punishments-.    The Home Secretary and the PrisonCommissioners are, however, preparedi if the Cabinet agrees, to apply the proposedcode to all convicted prisoners *    As the modifioations of the ferdinary rulesare generally in the direotion of leniency, it will be diffioult for any one to question their legality by actual legal proceedings.(2) As regards persons interned under Defence of the Realm Regulation 14B.the rules will take effect under the paragraph of that regulation which enactsthai an interned person &quot;shall be subject to the like restrictions .......as a prisoner of war except so far as the Secretary of State may modify such restrictions&quot;.Similar rules have been made and enforce::! in the ca&apos;se of Sinn Feinerspreviously interned in English Prisons, - and have never been questioned.Rule 16 which brings the interned men in certain circumstances under ordinaryPrison Rules is probably ultra vires in so far as it gives jurisdiction to the visiting committee to inflict punishments, but it has never been necessary toapply this in practice.    A difficulty will, however, arise when, an thetermination of the TJar, Defence of the Realm Regulation 14B, though still inforce in Ireland if the Emergency Laws Continuance Bill passes, will cease to operate in England.     In that event it appears that the internment of thesemen in England may be open to question, and the validity of rules made by theHr.me Secretary nay also be doubtful.The Secretary of State asks the authority of the Cabinet to hold these menin English Prisons and to apply the regulations notwithstanding the legal difficulties that may possibly arise.E a S .November, 18th, 1919.oil 94-98
