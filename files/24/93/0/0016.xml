m  as-Ja A S /60C7iPETROLEUM EXECUTIVEMEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.There are three petroleum questions which I wouldlike the Cabinet to consider and which for the sake of convenience-once I am putting forward together.(1)   The Agreement with the French Government on petroleummatters.This was discussed by the \7ar Cabinet on 20th Augustwhen it was decided to. withdraw the Agreement, hut I think that not only were Its scope and importance not fully realised, butthat there was considerable misapprehension as to the course ofthe negotiations which led up to It and with which the ForeignOffice and other Departments concerned had been kept in touchthroughout.     I have submitted to the Prime Minister a statement on the subject of which a copy is attached, and I desire to urge that tho ratification of the Agreement be now approved.(2)   Endeavours have been made for some months past toarrange the export of Russian petroleum products from Baku andGrosny through the Black Sea port,.For reasons which are fully stated in the attached memorandum It is essential to provide such an outlet for these products and the economic and political results of doing,soshould be considerable.     It is understood that the V/ar Officecan now offer some assistance in organising the transport ofthe oil and general co-ordination of the arrangements *It has been proposed that tho surplus, (estimated ata maximum of  2,000 per clay) due to tho excess of the priceobtainable on shipment at Black Sea ports over the cost of oil* -and its transport thither, should be devoted to establishing a credit for General Denikin./The
The Foreign Office, so far, have been unable toassent to the proposals on the ground that, as Baku is atpresent administered by the Azerbaijan Republic, an export tax on oil exported through that district cannot be levied for thebenefit of General Denikin.An export tax,if levied, however, could be imposedequally well at Batoum and it does not seem essential that thematter should be handled by export tax at all.     The ForeignOffice objection would in any case apply only to the Balm oil,whereas it is hoped to arrange for an equally large quantityfrom Grosny, which is situated in General Denikin&apos;s sphere.Quite apart from any financial assistance to the latter, it isconsidered to be of great importance to restore the oil industry in the districts north and south of the Caucasus, this being a necessary preliminary to the establishment of order and prosperity in those regions.It is understood that the Treasury would have noobjection to the scheme, provided that no charges, direct or indirect, incurred in connection with it fall on public funds.(3)      In. regard to the handling of petroleum questionsgenerally and the future of the Petroleum. ExecutiveI think that the Cabinet perhaps do not fully realise the importance of this subject and its growing complexity which makes s unified and co-ordinated control imperative.     Theproblem is not merely one of supplies for this country, though this was the most prominent feature during the war, but hasbecome world-^ide in its application.      I consider it essential,therefore, that the Betroleum Executive should be continued undera. Minister ^ho can devote a good deal of time to it and who is/not
not responsible for a Department whioh. is itself a oonaumer.Tho Strike Committee of tho Cabinet reoonimended thatthese matters should be taken over by tho Board of Trado.   Iinstructed Sir John Cadman, Director of tho Potroloum Executive,1 understand that tho latter will now circulate a memorandumindicating the- reasons why ouch an arrangement io not desirable.I think that, in considering the quostion, the Cabinot shouldhave before it my memorandum (G/f.6930) of 27th February last,of which a copy is attached.There appear to be two ways in whioh tho petroleum executive could bo continued without becoming part of thomachinery of a large department interested in oil questions, anarrangement whioh would prevent it from exercising effectivelytho co-ordinating duties which constitutes one of its mootimportant functions.(a) As a small Dopartmont working undor tho Chancellorof tho Exchequer and maintained dirpotly fromTreasury votes.(b) Working under tho Chancellor of tho Duchy of lancaster, or other Minister without heavydopartmontal duties,Tho Potroloum Executive ohould exercise a gonoralcontrol over oil questions and, in viow of the close oonnoctionbotween Government purchases and policy and in order to prevontoverlapping I recommend that Dopartmontal oil purohaseo shouldbe made in consultation with the Petroleum Executive.to see the Precldent of the Board of Trade on the subject, andW.H.L.11.XI.19.
&apos;   STATEMENT Oil PRENOH AGREEMENT.I hope th$ Cabinet 7/111 bo. willing at an earlydate to reconsider their decision in connection with theAnglo-French Agreement about Oil Supplies.In tho pr9vious discussion, it was believed by thePrime Hinister and. t.ho Foreign Secretary that in tho early stages of tho negotiations, there had been no proper appreciation ofthe aspect of the case from&apos;the point of view of high policy,and no proper consultation or communication with tho ForeignOffice.     Indood, Lord Curzon was understood to say that thoForeign Office knew nothing of the mattor till tho mooting heldthere on tho 24th April.     How far this is from the true historyof the case will be seen from the following brief summary ofthe history of tho negotiations:-Tho participation of tho Blronch in the Mosopotamianoilfields was first mooted when Senator Beronger and twocolleagues met Sir J. 0adman and two colleagues.The Fronoh Ambassador wroto formally to our foreign Office.The Foreign Office forwarded a copy of the ambassador&apos;s letter to the Potroloun Executive.At a conference at which Mr. Long was in the Chair,and the Foreign Office represented, it was decided that theGovernment should at onco signify its- willingness to .co-operate with France beforo she secured American assistance, and beforotho country was forced by public decisions at the Peace conference to adopt in self-defence the policy of co-operation to which itwas now invited.It was made cle-ar that the area included in thoAnglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s concession in Persia, could not bodisouscod or ro-ononed.&apos;    /At

The Shell Agreement, out of whioh the French Agreement 3had arisen, Same before the Cabinet.     Lord Ourzon said that hepersonally had not been consulted, and was not sure that theForoign Office had concurred.At a meeting, with Lord Curzon in tho Chair, theFrench agreement and its bearing on tho Shell Agreement, was discussed.   It was recommended that the Government Shouldconcur in It, subject to the concurronco of. the. War Cabinetin the Shell agreement, and to tho Foreign Office concurrence inthe French Agreement.The War Cabinet approved.of the Shell agreement.- Tho Foreign Office concurred in the French Agreement,and sent a formal ratification to the French Ambassador.The Foreign Office forwarded a copy of the aboveletter to tho Petroleum Executive.A oomplaint has, as I have already indicated, beenmade that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Offioo in London worenot kept properly informed of our negotiations.     Surely, in face ofthe statement above, it Is olear that, if there was any lack of proper communication, it was not tho fault of the petroleum executive.      I waa fully informed of everything that took place froithe very beginning.   I was present at most of the interviews vdththe French Ministers,&apos; There was never any question that they woroauthorised by their Prime Minister and their Government to act forFrancs.     It will be romombered that I had been given an absolutelyfroe hand by the Cabinet to act in all oil matters for tho UnitedKingdom.   This was only one of many negotiations with tho French/and
and other Governments;   and from the &quot;beginning I laid iL downas a rule to bo most rigorously kept that the Foroign Offiooand all tho othor Dopartmento ooiicornodV were to be koptinformed of everything that was being done, and that theirassent wae to be obtained before any stops were taken or anyagreements drawn up.I would ear-hootIJr beg the Cabinet to reconsider tho matter inthe light of the fadts disclosed in this memorandum, which show how greatly wo are committed to the French Government, and aldoIn fade of the great overwhelming fact that oil is becomingevery day more vital to our national life)   and that if woloci the opportunities which have grown out of the war, wo shall probably never be able to regain our position, and shallundoubtedly suffer once again from a shortnoso of. supplies which will gravely hamper our national action.My instructions were moot faithfully obeyed;   anda4tebroi^ 1919.i...... ii.ii.it.&apos;................T. i...i..p. i i..,
Memorandum on the question of the export of oil from South Russia,A note by the Quartermaster-General in regard to thepossibility of re-establishing the export of petroleum from south Russia is attached.It is understood that the Shell Group, who are theprincipal British oil concern in South Russia, are prepared tocarry the responsibilities which it is suggested should beundertaken by them in the note attached.   Appended to this note is a memorandum prepared by Mr. R, Waley Cohen (of that group) on the question.All risks will be taken by the Shell Group, thestatus of which is sufficient to guarantee its bona fides, andthe advantages that will accrue from its success are of theinestimable importance to this country.     These advantages are set forth in the attached note, but are briefly recapitulatedbelow;-(l)    The success of the scheme will assist in resuscitatingand stabilising normal conditions in South Russia, and will thus materially further the objects which we have in view there.(2)    The scheme affords some prospect of enabling theBritish Government to recover some of their expenditure in      :?South Russia.(3)   The scheme will reduce importations of oil to theUnited Kingdom from the American Continent, and hence naturallyassist the exchange problem.It is important for the success of this scheme that theearliest possible approval should be accorded to it, and that &apos;it should be set going with the least possible delay.
NOTE BY THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL IN&apos; REGARD TO THEIMPORTANCE AND POSSIBILITY OP IMMEDIATE EXPORT   OPPETROLEUM PROM SOUTH RUSSIA.1. It is of paramount importance that theinhabitants of South Russia should be enabled and encouraged to re-establish their commercial life.     While this isstagnant, an atmosphere favourable to disturbance and disorder must continue.     If commerce can be restarted,conditions will favour peace and normal life,2. The Baku region on the Black Sea   is entirelydependent on the oil industry, and the situation isgradually becoming worse.     All the outlets are closed,with the result that storage capacity is becoming choked -and when this stage is reached, as it must inevitably beunless vigorous action from outside is taken, the whole industry will have to close down and thousands of workers employed in it will be thrown out of work.3. Grosny, the other main oil centre, is on therailway which runs through Denikin&apos;s area.     Oil can be shipped from the Baku area by a pipeline to Batoum.     PromGrosny it is carried by rail to Novorossisk for shipment.4. At Baku, the producers have formed a &quot;Soviet&quot;,andit would, I understand, be possible to purchase from them.     The Grosny fields are largely the property of foreigners./The
^he produce is, however, mainly petrol and therefore more valuable.While It is difficult to give exact figures., I am informed that at Batoum 1,000 tons of oil a clay could be madea v-i 11 able,5.        I understand that the Shell Group would be preparedto organise the export of the whole of the quantities of oil which can be made available at Batoum and Novorossisk, andalso to arrange for their removal by tank steamers, and disposalin the various markets of the world, and also that they are Ina position to arrange through their intimate relations in Grosnyand Baku for the purchasing of the petroleum from the producersorganisations.It is not anticipated that international complicationsare likely to arise, as the Shell organisation covers the FrenchInterest as well as the British in this ares, and there is onlya small outside Belgian interest with-which it would probably not be difficult for them (The Shell Company) to arrange withthe assistance of the Government if necessary.6,        But for the scheme to be successful it is consideredthat it would be necessary for the War Office to issue definite instructions to all British Officers serving In this region toensure that they assist by every means in their power in carry-ing out the necessary arrangements;     It would further, I think,be essential to the success of the scheme that an Officer of arank not less than Major General should be despatched to theSouth of Russia charged with the task of carrying the scheme into effect.     With him the Shell Group should be asked to sendone or two civilians capable of making the necessary arrange-ments for the purchase of the oil and the technical dispositionsnecessary along the pipeline and at the shipping ports,/The
The Shell Group would of course have to beresponsible that the scheme is entirely ,.self-supporting, and   ;.;no expenses should be charged to the Government in connection ;-with the mission.I understand that the possibility, of organising the&apos; -export in the ordinary commercial way-through purely civilianchannels has been considered, but information gathered from various sources during the last, few months makes it appear in.the highest degree improbable that any success can be achievedunless assisted by a military mission on the lines indicated,above v       - : ; . -.. VYi      Apart from the considerable benefit to Denikin froma purely military point of view which Would result from a &apos;-&apos;:revival of expert trade, and the restoration of normal...,,conditions in the large area in his Lines of Communication&apos;, thisscheme if successful would tend to render: easier a stableGovernment when hostilities with the; Bolshevists have ceased.It would also create.a powerful protection, against Bolshevistpropaganda.: . The Azerbeidjan Republic and the Georgian :Republic would also benefit, and c ond it ions, -round. B.atOum--would....Improve. . .-   .8.      It would seem possibly a little shortsighted to givethe considerable assistance to Denikin in material and money which the British Government has in the past and is&apos;continuing,and at the same time to neglect the opportunities of commercialassistance which the circumstances invite,.^Military assistanceinvolves a burden on the British State.    -The commercial schemewhich is suggested would involve none.   On the contrary, itwould have the considerable advantage.from the financial pointof view, viz: -(a) It will tend to improve the credit of South Russia.(b) It will reduce, importations.of oil to the United/Kingdom
-   571Kingdom from the American continent, and hencenaturally assist the exchange question,(c)       It would, I am told, be possible by means of an.export tax to create a credit far Denikin&apos;sGovernment which might be used to pay their debt to the Brit ish Government,9, The question of export tax, however, would require careful handling.     If Denikin were to attempt to confiscateoil belonging to foreigners or local inhabitants the scheme would of course break down.   If, on the other hand, the taximposed were jnade too high the price woiild be above the world market price, and the scheme would fail, as no market couldbe found for the Oil. ;I am told, however, that there is a margin -particularly if the export tax were paid, to the credit ofDenikin&apos;s Government in London.This matter, however, could be further developedif the scheme is entertained. .10.        As will be noted, the Shell Group would undertakeconsiderable financial risk under the scheme. &apos; They have wide experience of the South Russian trr:de, and it is unlikely thatthey would be prepared to embark upon the scheme unless it hadin their view a fair prospect of success. ,. ,.As no financial .risk upon the British Government is involved it seems that the. experiment, is well worth considera-tion.&apos;  But in view of the circumstances referred to in paras.1 rnd 2, the sooner action is taken, the more likely is thescheme to succeed, and the greater -^ill be the advantagesaccruing from it.(Intd.)

Memorandum &quot;by Mr. R. Waley-Cohen regarding the export ofPetroleum from South Russia.It is assumed that the direct advantages which thescheme would be required to afford would be -(1)   That by moving a large quantity of petroleum from the fields the reservoirs would be freed, so that production could be resumed, the refineries worked, and theIndustrial population profitably employed.(2)   Funds must be provided in roubles which would enablethe producing companies to pay their work-people, andtheir local expenses.(3)   Funds must be provided in sterling for the producers toenable them to purchase in Europe and America the large quantity of material necessary to restore normal working in the fields.(4)   Funds must be provided for the British Governmentwhich could, be made available for the requirements ofDenikin&apos;s Government in London, and, if desired, ofany other of the local Governments -horn the BritishGovernment might desire to assist.(5)   The whole scheme must be sound commercially and self-supporting without any subvention from the British.Government.,Taking the last condition first it Is evident thatthe price paid for the oil must be such as to enable it to compete with petroleum from other sources of supply.America is by far the largest source of supply of theworld&apos;s petroleum requirements to-day, and it is suggested,therefore, that the price to be paid by the Shell Group for the oil, free on board steamers in the Black Sea, would be thecurrent market price for American oil of similar quality free onboard the principal American shipping ports, viz:- New OrleansPort Arthur, and the other United States ports in the Gulf ofMexico.     This price would be fixed monthly, and as eachshipment leaves Batoum or llovorossisk its value, based onthis price, would be available.
I have had some difficulty in determining how this money should be. divided, with a view to securing tho threoobjects mentioned above, and I have come to the conclusionthat the sum payable to the- producers should provisionallybe- fix*ed at the present &quot;current prioe.3 which have boenfixed at Baku and Greeny by the producers, having regard tothe circumstances of the moment.   Those prices are, Of course,very low indeed, because they represent a figure at whichthe producers are anxious to secure purchasers at a time-when they have no outlet for their production.     They probablyrepresent little, if any, profit to any producer, andpossibly some- loss to some of those who work less economicallythan otaers.     They would not in any oaso provide fundsnecessary for resuming normal development, but I would suggestthat any increase which may take place in the world market price, and which would thus raise- the ultimate price payable for the oil at the seaboard, should be- earmarked for the producers to provide them, as soon as circumstances pormit,with funds for the proper development of their territory,and with a reasonable profit.   There are Indications whichpoint to the- view that some increase may reasonably beexpectod which will render this possible.   However, the Bakuand Greeny priceo of to-day having been fixed provisionallyby the local &quot;bureau&quot; of the.producers in Baku, and apparentlyalso by some similar body in Groony, they could certainly be utilised to start with ac a basis for the first exports.These prices should be adjusted monthly in accordance withthe prices payable at tho seaboard.Money should be provided in sterling by the ShellGroup in respect of each cargo as soon as it is ohipped.The producers would be required to declare monthlythe- proportion of proceeds due to them which they would&apos;require to receive in roubles, and the proportion which theywould require to receive in sterling.   Tho latter portion/would
would be .paid to them in London,&apos; but the portion required inroubles would have to he remitted to Russia at a fixed rateof exchange, which at present would be 300 roubles persterling.General Denikin would no doubt be prepared to enterinto an arrangement by -which, against the payment to him of sterling in London, he would undertake to pay the equivalentroubles to the producers in Russia., With regard to the funds to be provided under paragraph 4, there are to-day certain fixed charges incurredbetween the-despatch of the oil from the producers at Bakuand Grosny and its shipment f.o,b. the Black Sea, -,-As regards Baku these charges consist of a charge for filling into&apos; tank cars, an export tax levied by theAzerbeidjan Government, town dues, excise, pipeline freight,&apos;a charge which appears to be levied by the Georgian Governmentand sqme small dues charged at xJatoum,As regards the Grosny oil, the charges are made upof an excise, railway freight from Grosny to Hovorcssisk,and an export tax levied by the Terek Cossacks.: It; will be convenient to treat these separately,(a) BAATJ.   -These charges are in some cases&apos; exorbitant,having been multiplied manyfold since the war, but assuming that the pipeline will be used for kerosene the charges,when all added together, still bring the cost of the oil -upon the basis- payable to the producers which I have suggested above - to approximately C,l per ton less than the cost of american oil.I think that It might be suggested-that these charges sho\ild therefore be paid in full, on the understandingthat they cover the whole of the expenditure from despatchby the producers until shipment f,o,b, steamers in Batoum,/and
?f JdM     4j    *Mand with regard to the- difference of about  1 per ton onthe kerosene shipped through the pipeline- I suggest that thisshould be placed at the disposal of the British Governmentfor use as a loan to General Denikin, on the understandingthat the Government of South Russia should be responsiblefor its ultimate repayment, after an interval of say tenyears.Assuming that only 1,000 tons a day of kerosene canbe passed through the pipeline the figures would work out as followsPayment to the producers,..,............... 5. 3. 0. per tonex Baku.Payments to cover all taxes and expenses between Baku and shipmentf,o.b. Bat cum............................ 3.15. 0. per ton.Loan through the British Governmentto General Denikin....................... 1. 0. 0.   &quot;     &quot;In addition to the kerosene it is probable that further exports by rail tank oar from Baku and Batoum ofpetroleum and lubricating oil could be arranged under similar conditions, except that there will not be any margin toprovide for a loan to General Denikin out of thoso shipments,as the heavy expenses of bringing.these- products by rail toBatoum will not leave any margin over the ourrent world market prices.   They will, however, assist in paying the generalexpanses of the railway line from Baku to Batoum, and to thoextent that they are possible they will, roughly speaking,allow of the export taxes and transport charges at present being made.It will be seen that the Baku sohomo will providea credit of about  1,000 per day for the loan to general denikin, besides a credit of about  3,800 per day out of whichthere will no doubt be a largo profit to General Denikin1oGovernment, aftor satisfying the expenses of the- pipeline andpaying the dues at present charged by the Azerboidjan Government/and
and the town of Daku,In appreciating the incidence of this charge of 3.15*0. for taxes and transport from Baku to Batoumit may be interesting to mention that the Shell Group areat present transporting oil through a pipeline in Americaof almost exactly the same length as the Baku/Batoum line,morebut one which is much/expensive to operate, as Itruns under the Mississippi River as a common carrier at a charge of less than 12/- per ton.(b) GROSFY.   The most valuable product produced in GrosnyIs petrol, and so long as the transport available by railfrom Grosny to Hovoroosisk is limited it will probably bedesirable to utilise it entirely for the export of thisproduct.    Various qualities and types of petrol areproduced in Grosny, and they all have different values, butit is expected that arrangements in regard to this productcan be made similar to that which is cug ested above inregard to the export of kerosene from Balm through the pipeline, provided the rolling s^tock of tank wagons andlocomotives permits of the maintenance of regular shipmentfrom Grosny to Novorossisk by rail.Whilst the figures are somewhat indefinite itappears likely that on these shipments also a lean to general denikin representing  1 per ton upon the products shippedcould be provided.The Shell Group owned before the war many hundreds of tank wagons in Russia.     Nothing is known as to where theseare, or what condition they are in, but if the military representative refer.-ed to in the Quarter Master General1smemorandum, and the Shell representatives can report thattransport conditions are secured and sufficiently normal tojustify the despatch of further tank wagons, the Shell group would be prepared to order and send out to Russia an additional200 or 300 tank wagons, in order to make it possible to increaS&apos;
- 6 - 77Increase the shipments of Grosny oil from Kovorossisk, but thiswould only be feasible if sufficient locomotives could bemade available to General Denikin to utilise these wagons,and if the conditions are sufficiently- secure to satisfy the Shell Group that there is reasonable security that thewagons that they would thus be sending out would be utilised for the purpose intended, both now and in the future.It is fully realised that no British military force is available,, but I understood from the Secretary ofState that he would be prepared to arrange for the MilitaryMissions to lend all their influence in assisting the scheme,and with the help of an Officer of high rank to be sent out from the       Office I am advised by those of the Shell staff who have recently returned from Russia that they are ofopinion that the scheme could be brought to operation.The Shell Group would be prepared to attach to the missionMr. Coates, who has bern constantly working in close touchwith the former British Missions in &quot;Grosny, and they wouldalso instruct their general representative, Mr. Dykstra,to arrange for the whole of the Shell organisation in Russia,to work in close co-operation with him.In addition to the support of the British MilitaryMissions in South Russia and also the British Consuls and vice-consuls in that region, it would be a matter of vital   0importance to secure rapid telegraphic or wirelesscommunication with England,, in order to arrange the necessarytonnage.   With the present shortage of tank steamers andcongestion at all the ports in the world where repairs ofsteamers can be effected, the organisation of the tanktonnage fleet necessary for the r^mdval of some 500,0,00 tonsof petroleum products from the Black Sea would involve many difficulties, which, however, I can undertake to overcome/with
with the assistance of the Shell Group, provided rapidcommunication to and fro indicated above can be absolutelyassured.(SGD)   . R. WALEY COHEN.  -13th October, 1919.
PETROLEUM   EXECUTIVE.MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.(The need for a permanent Petroleum Department)The Petroleum Executive was called into being in April, 1917, as a war measure.     Up to that time each government Department had managed its own oil affairs,but the conflict of claims on a supply of tonnage whichwas being seriously reduced by enemy action necessitated the creation of some independent advisory and decidingbody, and in consequence the Petroleum Executive was instituted to co-ordinate matters connectedwith petroleum and to programme the requirements of the variousconsuming departments.At its suggestion the Inter-Allied PetroleumConference was inaugurated and the Committee on ImperialPolicy set up.     Various technical committees have alsomet under its auspices.It has been constantly referred to by all departments, has collected and distributed statisticaland other information, has been in frequent consultationwith the Foreign Office and Colonial Office on all questions (political and otherwise) affecting the pro-auction of oil in foreign countries and British posses-sions, and has maintained close touch with the Admiralty,War Office, Air Ministry and Ministry of Shipping.    Thework of the Department has very greatly Increased evenduring the last six months.It is submitted that the growing importanceof petrpletm as one of the &quot;key&quot; industries justifiedthe continuance in peace of a department whose utilitywas demonstrated during the war.Our dependence on seaborne and to a largeextent on foreign supplies for our immense requirementsof petroleum make the whole question one of peculiarimportance vitally affecting our naval and mercantilesupremacy and provides a strong argument for special and separate   treatment.     On the other hand should the search for petroleum whioh is now being made in thiscountry prove successful, the Industry would require tobe supervised by such a specialised department as that suggested.It can confidently bo asserted th&amp;t the petroleum Executive could not have rendered services of equal value had it been attached to an existing Depart-ment, and to make it, if placed   on a permanent basis,an adjunct of, say, the Board of Trade - &apos;&apos;or the Ministryof Supply would, it is thought, not be satisfactory to
other Departments, which would feel that their interestscould not he impartially or adequately served *     Thonecessity for adjustment of the requirements of consumingDepartments will, it is true, loom less largo as thequestion of supply of petroleum becomes less difficult,but there will bo other matters in which Departmentalinterests will conflict, and on which it is important that there should Tee an independent decision.Such a Department must be in charge of a minister of the Crown who would .be responsible to his majesty s Government for petroleum policy,.The need for a clearly defined and settled oilpolicy is daily becoming more apparent and this, is recognised by the French, who have recently constituted a separate Ministry of Petroleum under tho chancesf aSertator, and are taking up a very decided attitude ^npetroleum questions at the Peace Conference,     Tho Italianshave taken a somewhat similar step, and thlsn3f.&apos;ca.-U y, towhich petroleum is evon more vital, should net be allowedto&quot;be at a disadvantage through lack of a similar organ-ization.The staff necessary for manning the department would bo small and Its cost would be trifling as oomparodwith tho importance of the work to be accomplished.W.H.L.27.2.19
