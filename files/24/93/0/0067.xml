Letter dated Oth Cot;brr, ^ 1919, from Sir G., Riddel1to Sir v . Kankey.. ,My dear Hankey,As doubtless you are aware, it has been the praotice forGovernment Departments during the war to issue official decu-ments to the press marked for publication not before a oertaindate.   Under jeaoe conditions this practice in some instancesoauses serious inconvenience and injustice.The Newspaper Conference, representing the London and provincial press, have therefore&apos; pdssed a resolution that infuture this practice should be confined to long and detaileddocuments, particularly those containing a mass of figures,which oannot readily be telegraphed.The Conference will be much obliged if the Cabinet can give effect to this resolution.   It-Is thought better to com-&apos;munioate with you rather than to write to each of the Depart-Reinforcements concerned.   The Conference consider that there should bea recognised system in all the offices.   In some oases earlycopies of a document are issued to newspaper representativeswithout   any restriction as to date of publication, while later the document is iesucc; to the press as a whole subject to a daterestriction.   Naturally this causes curious complications.These difficulties are not likely to occur if the practice is confined as above indicated.Very faithfully yours,(Sgd.)    GEORGE A RIDDELL,Vice-Ohairman.Whitehall Ga/dens, s,VJ.29th November, 1919, .have them a day in advance, must not Toe published until theyhave been made arailable to Members of parliament.  -%\ ,       I shall be glad to receive y ur instructions in orderthat I may reply tc sir George Riddell&apos;s letter.(Sgd.)   15.P..A.
