J n     A. I,  A- A&quot;JMJ? SJ^nt is the Prco-v ,/   ^J .     -fe^^ Mdaoyt Q^;tr. &quot;z      2195^&amp;^^QRAKDUM BY THE MINI&amp;TER OP HEALTH MJU9s,,KXB:his COKIENSATION (WAR ADDITION) BILL,CO/I am concerned to note the   generous scale ofcompensation proposed under this Bill. (C*P*187)Experience of the working of Health Insurance has proved the importance of the principle that the Benefit to a disabledworker should never exceed an amount which would diminish the incentive to his recovery and resumption of work, and I feel thatoa payment of 35/- weekly by way of compensation to a workerS v bearning; say, 40/- weekly, (i.e. 87-?$ of the wages) is excessive,and will create a serious precedent.     If, later on, wages tendto diminish, it may happen, under the Bill, that a worker will gotas much by way of compensation as by wages.Temporary legislation of this character must beregarded in the light of its ultimate effects, and I suggest that the granting of a percentage of 87^ of wages will prejudice themaintenance of a lower standard when, under more settled conditions)the.contemplated revision, of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts isundertaken by Parliament.The Bill would also have the effect of focussing criticism on the proposed Benefit figures of our forthcoming Health and unemployment Bills, in which the State has a direct financial interest.I suggest that, in no case, should the compensationexceed two-thirds of the weekly wags ( as against the pre-war figure ofone half) and that, in view of the higher wages new prevailing,s.the &quot;ordinary maximum&quot; should be raised from  1 to 30/-This, in tho case of the higher paid workers such ass .miners, will give a &quot;total maximum&quot; of 40/-, being the sum already agreed to by the Mining Association and Miners&apos; Federation.Ministry of Health.
