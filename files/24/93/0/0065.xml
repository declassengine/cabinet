IViK. C. 1 0&apos;NGH?JTMjggcmiart is the Property of His Britannic Maiesty&apos;s Government!251Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1919.American reservations to the peace treaty.THE Prime Minister asked me to circulate a paper respecting the effect uponthe Peace Treaty of the reservations adopted by the United States Senate. Thefollowing very clear statement has been prepared by Mr. Hurst, Legal Adviser to the november 19, 1919.Collectively the effect of the reservations to the Treaty of Peace now adopted bythe Senate of the United States would be to create the situation that the United states should be allowed to come into the peace settlement upon a footing different to thatupon which the &apos;Other Powers come in. The United States is not the only country which would like to make special terms for itself in the peace settlement by agreeing,to the Treaty subject to reservations. China asked to be allowed to do so, and therequest was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Council at Paris, none taking amore prominent part in the decision than the representative of the United States.Roumania and the Serb-Croat-Slovene State have hesitated as to the acceptance ofthe Austrian Treaty. To aecept now the reservations desired by the United StatesSenate would inevitably give rise to the impression among the other signatories of theTreaty of Peace, and more especially among the smaller&apos; Powers, that there is to be one rule for the United States and one rule for the rest of the world. President Taftappears to have told his countrymen that the reservations amount to an attempt onthe part of the United States to obtain all the benefits of the Treaty while shirkingall the burdens which its obligations entail.The principle for which the Allied Powers at Paris purported to be struggling,and. the basis upon which they posed as contracting, was that of substituting theprinciple of sharing in common the obligations of the civilised States for the condi-tion of affairs which had prevailed up to the time of the war of mere individualregulation of international relations. Once the principle is admitted that one ormore of the great Powers is to stand outside the settlement, the inevitable result mustbe to reintroduce the old state of affairs with all the uneasy conditions which haveprevailed in Europe for the last two decades.On the other hand, the failure of the attempt to effect the peace settlement in common deprives the work that was done of a great part of its value, and means that much of it must be done again. Questions like disarmament can only be dealt withby all the civilised States acting together. If the attempt made in the Covenant.ofthe League of Nations to settle this problem has no success, the World must return tothe condition of competition in armaments limited only by financial considerations.The United States is now so rich that no other Power could keep pace with her in a competitive struggle for armaments. For the British Empire, depending on its fleetfor security, the outlook would be particularly disquieting f consequently any chancethere may be of ultimately bringing in the United States ought not to be lost, but itshould be the whole Treaty or nothing, for any reservations imply the admission of a principle which is fatal to the whole basis upon which the Treaty was prepared.Dealing with the reservations individually, the first is to Article X. Under thisarticle, as drafted, the members of the League undertake to preserve against external aggression the territorial integrity of other members of the League. Under the reservation no obligation is to be imposed upon the United States under this articlewithout the consent of Congress on each occasion. In consequence, therefore, if Con-gress refused its assent to action being taken the United States would take no partin the protection of-the other members of the League. The President is probably right in saying that the effect of this reservation is to cut the heart out of the Covenant.It may well be that in practice the United States would move in flagrant cases, being forced thereto by public opinion at the moment, but the importance of the reservationForeign Office.C. of K.[1517]B
8,     as a result strong opposition may be anticipated both from trade unions and friendly societies.    Friendly societieswould probably lose at least half their present membership andthey would practically cease to recruit new members, as young workers would no longer be able to afford private insurance inaddition to the increased compulsory contribution!.     It is to be feared that under these conditions the entire disappearance ofthe voluntary friendly societies would be a question of a fewyears.9.     The cost of collecting contributions would beenormously increased and wholesale evasion would be inevitable.Except in the case of large employers where Inspection is easy,compulsory contributions can only be enforced with the good-willeither of the employer or the worker.    ft he re both are anxious to escape the contribution, no amount of inspection can be fully effective.    Even with an army of inspectors, contributions ofl/lO and 1/6 could not be effectively collected in respect ofcasual, seasonal and intermittent employment.     Under the insurance acts a full weekly contribution is payable by the first employer in the week, however short the period of employment may be.     Thismeans   that the casual labourer or the woman field worker Y/ould be liable to a deduction of lid or 9d, as the case may be, fromperhaps a half day&apos;s wages, while the farmer or other employerwould have to make a similar payment in respect of every personemployed even for such short periods.10.     The utmost extent to which it appears safe to increasesickness (and therefore unemployment) benefit is 15/- for men and12/6 for women (with disablement benefit at 7/6), rates whichwould be accepted by approved societies.     This would entail ajoint weekly contribution of 1/5 for men and 1/3 for women, tobe shared between employer and worker.    The additional charge onthe/- 4 -
is that it would destroy the feeling of confidence which the existence of the obligationwould afford to the smaller States more liable to external aggression than an islandempire like Japan or a vast continental republic like the United States. The doctrinepreached at Paris was that the small States must trust to the League to protect them,but the small States cannot trust to the League unless they know that the members of Ithe League are pledged definitely to support them. If the United States are entitledto stand out, other countries may claim the same liberty, and so long as that is possiblethe small States may feel that they can trust to nothing but to their own right hand,and that they must arm and train in self-defence.To the British Empire the exclusion of the United States from the obligation under Article X means that burdens might have to be supported single-handedwhich no Government would lightly undertake without an assurance that the othergreat States would do their part, more particularly its great commercial rival acrossthe Atlantic. Great Britain cannot take part in a war without diverting itsshipping and its commerce from their normal channel, and if the United States areto be free to stand out, the Americans would use the opportunity to seize tradeopportunities which Great Britain was forced to forego.There is the further danger that a country with world-wide trade like theUnited States might find the interests of her citizens adversely affected by theoperations which were undertaken in support of one party under Article X and be driven into an attitude of opposition and to taking the other side in the struggle.The second reservation, dealing with domestic questions, was of less importanceup till the moment when the amendment to it was adopted bringing within its scopequestions affecting the present boundaries of the United States, its insular and otherpossessions. In its present form the reservation is mere arrogance. It would be intolerable for the British Empire to admit that all questions affecting the 3,000miles of boundary between Canada and the United States were questions solelywithin the domestic jurisdiction of the United States.The importance of the reservation with regard to the Monroe Doctrine dependsto a great extent upon the question whether the South and Central american republics come into the League of Nations or not. If they came in and the UnitedStates stayed outside, the provision already appearing in the Covenant (ArticleXXI) that the Covenant is not to be deemed to affect the Monroe Doctrine, would operate only in cases where all the parties concerned admitted that the monroe doctrine applied. The Monroe Doctrine is merely a policy which varies from timeto time, and if the South American Republics threw in their lot with the Leagueit is not probable that they would admit a very extended operation to it. For themto accept the reservation in its present form would mean the acceptance by them of the principle that the Monroe Doctrine is to be interpreted by the United Statesalone. It is inconceivable that States like the A. B. C. Powers should agree to this.To my mind, unless the United States come in without reservations to the Leagueof Nations the Monroe Doctrine is certain to give rise to so much friction as torender the Covenant unworkable, and I should be afraid that this fact will becomeso apparent to the other American Republics that tliey will hesitate to come into theLeague at all unless-the United States do the same.The fouth reservation is with regard to Shantung. It is difficult to see thatt\e reservation will benefit China. Japan is now in possession of the rights which she claims in Shantung; China is hopeless without the support of the other Powers,and for the United States to dissociate itself from the Shantung articles in theTreaty means, I think, that the United States will not help in enforcing suchlimitations as the Treaty imposes upon Japan and will thereby weaken the elementsthat tend to help China.The next reservation deals with the American representatives in all commis-sions, &amp;c, under the Treaty of Peace. From the point of view of other Powersthis reservation is of less importance. It is merely an attempt on the part of congress to tie the hands of the Executive Government, but it means that wherecommissions, &amp;c, are to be appointed by the Principal Allied and associated powers. America will not participate. If the other Powers are prepared to actwithout American participation their appointments of the commissions, &amp;c, wouldnot be invalid.The next reservation, dealing with the expenses of the League, is also a domesticmatter of small importance to other Powers. The objection to it is that whichappertains to all reservations, that it purports to enable the United States to fail tocarry out the obligations of the Treaty without violating it.
The seventh reservation deals with the limitation of armaments and providesthat even if the United States adopts any plan for the limitation of armaments asproposed by the Council of the League, she shall be free whenever she is threatened with invasion, or whenever she is engaged in war, to increase such armaments. Tomy mind, this reservation destroys the chief merit of the League of Nations. Thestate of Europe before the war was one in which the perpetual increase in arma-ments and the continual state of tension that was arising between the european powers were interacting upon each other in a way that rendered it impossible tosay which was the cause and which was the effect; in practice armaments had grownto an extent which ensured tension, and periods of tension were becoming so frequentthat the increase of armaments was inevitable. As Lord Grey once put it in theHouse of Commons, the continual increase of armaments was slowly bleeding europe to death. Nothing was likely to stop it except the introduction of a state of affairs which would create sufficient confidence in the minds of the Powers to render armingin self-defence unnecessary. Five hundred years ago no individual in this countrydared to go unarmed. Now he trusts to the constituted authorities to protect him.Consequently the arming of individuals in self-defence has become unnecessary andis no longer practised. Armaments are not going to disappear as between nationsexcept for the same reason, and if every nation is to be entitled to increase the arma-ments beyond the agreed limitation whenever it considers itself threatened withinvasion it is obvious that on the Continent of Europe the scheme outlined in ArticleVIII of the Covenant1 is not worth the paper on which it is written. It may well bethat the scheme in Article VIII is itself incapable otf realisation, but in any event itcannot work unless all accept it literally.The eighth reservation deals with the economic boycott. The economic boycottwas the weapon wherewith the League intended to coerce an aggressive or recalcitrantmember. The complexities of modern commerce have rendered no nation selfsupporting. On the other hand, there is no nation whose individual contribution tothe commerce of the world is vital to all the rest; consequently an economic boycott,if it could be worked, was certain to be effective. An economic boycott with the americans standing outside it is certain to mean that the Americans will endeavourto trade with the boycotted country. The drafting of Article XVI of the Covenantis very unsatisfactory because it is not made sufficiently clear that the prohibition ofintercourse between nationals of the one party and nationals of the other is merelycomplementary to the prohibition of trade between the two countries; but whatever the precise effect of the article, it is essential that the United States and Americancitizens should not be allowed to trade in any way in which other members of theLeague and the nationals of those members are prohibited from doing. Any claim for special treatment for the citizens of an active commercial Power like the UnitedStates is bound to bring the whole machine of the economic boycott to grief.The last reservation deals with the rights of United States citizens in propertyaffected by Articles 296 and 297 of the Treaty of Peace. This is a reservation aimeddirectly at the Allies. If it means anything it means that the measures which theTreaty entitles a country like the United Kingdom to take with regard to enemy property in this country are liable to be complicated by complaints that the propertyrights of American citizens are adversely affected. During the war we have had several tiresome questions with the United States of this kind, arising out of the liquidation of German businesses whose owners were alleged by the United states to be American citizens. Any acceptance of the principle embodied in this reserva-tion would be made the excuse by the United States Government for all manner ofinconvenient claims, and would certainly render more tiresome the working of allthe proposed machinery for the settlement of debts and for the treatment of enemy property.The papers this morning state that President Wilson has announced his inten-tion to refuse to accept the reservations passed by the Senate. In that case theUnited States Government will not ask the other Powers whether or not they areprepared to accept these reservations. It is to be hoped that President Wilson will stand by the statements he has made. If he does not, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill then be face to face with the question whether they are prepared to undertake the responsibilities which the Covenant of the League of Nations entails upon them if the United States decline to participate.The Covenant cannot be separated from the rest of the Treaty, and, great asthe responsibilities and obligations which the&apos; Covenant entails may be, it seems that[15171 B 2
the loss of the Treaty would be a greater disaster. In these circumstances the sug-gestion which was recently made that His Majesty&apos;s Government should couple theirratification of the Treaty with a declaration that they will withdraw from theLeague at the end of the period of two years provided for in Article I ought to be seriously considered. To me it seems the only way out of the difficulty. It could bemade subject to an intimation that if all the other civilised Powers joined the Leagueit would be withdrawn, and also with a suggestion that unless they had done so aconference of all the Powers who signed the Treaty of Peace with Germany and all those who were invited to become, original members of the League should take place to arrive at an agreed substitute for. the existing Covenant.The existing Covenant of the League is not by any means an ideal instrument,and if, within two years it were possible to substitute an improved and simplifieddraft for the existing one, it would be a great advantage.(Signed)        C. J. B. HURST.November 18, 1919.Annex.&quot; Times,&quot; November 15, 1919.The Reservation to Article X now passed by the Senate is: The United States assumes no obligation to preserve the territorial integrityor political independence of any other country, or interfere in controversiesbetween nations, whether members of the League or not, under the provisions ofArticle X, or to employ the military or naval forces of the United States under any article in the Treaty for any purpose unless in any particular case Congress,which under the Constitution has the sole power to declare war, or authorisethe employment of the military or naval forces, shall by act or joint resolutionhave so provided.Article X in the Covenant of the League of Nations is as follows : The members of the League undertake to. respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League.
