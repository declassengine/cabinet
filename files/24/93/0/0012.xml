CHURCHILL.\Uh November, 1919.Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.1. The effective troops at Lord Haig&apos;s disposal at the outbreak of the strike consisted of 2,000 Cavalry, 27,000 Artillery, 8,000 Engineers and 63,000 Infantry, or a total of100,000 men. This total did not include the Administrative Services and 39 RegularBattalions preparing for embarkation overseas, besides other Units which were in process either of demobilization or re-organization and consequently unfit for activeemployment. All of these latter were, however, available as a last reserve if thesituation became so grave as to necessitate their being used.2. Of the 100,000 men mentioned above, 36,000 provided from 33 infantry battalions and available personnel in R.A. and R.E. Units, Dep6ts, &amp;c, were employed atthe outset of the strike on definite protection duties or moved, as a precautionary measure,to positions of readiness. I may mention that the number of troops employed on theseprotection duties was a small proportion of those that would actually have been requiredhad the strike been on a more extended scale. In fact, if all the protection dutiesanticipated by the various Civil Government Departments, in certain eventualities, hadbeen demanded, it would have been impossible for the Army in Great Britain, large asit was at the time, to have provided the necessary numbers. *3. The provision of the necessary mechanical transport and drivers for themovement of the troops put a severe strain on the military resources available. the difficult)7&apos; was overcome, after some delay, by emergency measures which necessitatedputting into running order lorries that were surplus and awaiting disposal, and by bringing others from France.4. As you are aware, orders have been issued for demobilization to be completedas rapidly as possible, and for the Army to be reduced to a minimum required toprovide 30,000 effective bayonets in Great Britain, and 25,000 effective bayonets inIreland.5, When this demobilization has been completed, probably by the end of November,we shall only have in Great Britain, exclusive of Ireland, approximately 40,000infantry, which will consist of 12,000 conscripts temporarily retained during the periodof reorganization of the Regular Army, and 28,000 regulars, mostly recruits withyoung and inexperienced non-commissioned officers, and weak in training and discipline.Apart from its lack of training, this force will be totally inadequate numerically tocarry out the abnormal protection and other duties for which, at present, the Army is responsible. I would also point out, that since this force, with possibly the two divisions in Ireland and such reservists as may be required to bring them up to war strength, will be the only infantry available for reinforcing our garrisons overseas, inthe event of such contingency arising, it is of paramount importance that it should notbe used, except as a last resource, in any future industrial disturbances, but be allowedto prepare itself for its legitimate duties in the defence of the Empire.* The numbers required, calculated by General Headquarters, Great Britain, amounted to no loss than331 iniantry battalions, or 265,000 men, equivalent to the infantry of 28 divisions.(B19/519)  90  11/19   1I&amp;S   7685\vo
G. In order, therefore, to meet these new conditions, whieh give cause for consider-able anxiety, I would urge the necessity of the following measures being taken, withoutfurther delay: (a.) That existing military guards on all warlike stores and factories under thecontrol of the Ministry of Munitions and other Government Departments be withdrawn and relieved by civil watchmen or similar personnel.(b.) That, in case of industrial trouble, all protection duties and assistance to thecivil power be found by the police, assisted where necessary by suchorganizations as Special Constables or Citizen Guards.(c.) That the Army be relieved by the. General Post Office of all responsibility forthe maintenance of telegraphs, telephones and other means of communica-tion. It will be impossible for the War Office to carry out this importantduty in&apos; any future emergency, owing to the reduction of trained personnel in the technical units concerned, and to their being composed of a largeproportion of recruits.(d.) That, in case of the Army being required as a last resource, when the situation may be getting beyond the control of the civil power, the Ministry of Trans-port be prepared to provide the mechanical and other transport necessary forthe movement of the troops. An estimate of what would be required insuch a contingency is being prepared by the War Office.7. Unless these measures can be made effective in the near future I can give no assurance that the army will be in a position to meet the call that may be made upon itin the event of aggravated industrial trouble breaking out, and I am advised that suchan emergency is to be expected about the New Year.Henry Wilson, *Chief of the Imperial General Staff.6th November, 1919.
APPENDIX.LETTER FROM FIELD-MARSHAL EARL liAIG, K.T., &amp;o., TO THE SECRETARY OF TOEWAR OFFICE.Sir, 17th October, 1919.T have the honour to submit for the informal ion of the Army Council the following Report on theMilitary Measures taken during the recent Railway Strike, together with certain conclusions arisingtherefrom.2. The strike was officially declared to begin at 12 midnight. 26th/27th September. This information was conveyed to Commands at 15.20 on that dale. A carefully worked out plan of operations to cover a contingency of this nature had been prepared and in existence for many months at these&apos;Headquarters. all arrangements had been worked out in detail with the Home Office, Food Ministry, Coal Controller, and other government Departments. Each Command had been supplied with the necessary information, and had itsown schema pivpared and ready to by put in operation on receipt of orders. The broad principle had been laid down that troops should be kept largely concentrated and as little in evidence as possible until actuallyrequired.3. The immediate requirements of the Home Office in the matter of military protection in this instancewere decided at a meeting of the Protection Committee on the afternoon of the 27th September, at whichthe Secretary of Stale for War, who was pre ent, instructed me to guard certain vulnerable points. Thenecessary orders were issued to Commands by telegram between 18.15 and 19.11 on that date, with theresnli that all ihe important railways, power stations, &amp;c, were eventusilly secured against destruction orviolence. It is thought that this condition of organized readiness had an important influence in the quietattitude of the strikers.4. The troops available were as shown on Schedules A, B and C attached, and consisted of three categories: (a.) Mobile troops for use in larger formations.(b.) &quot; Miscellaneous&quot; or &quot;immobile&quot; troops for furnishing small guards and detachments,(c.) General Headquarters, Reserves.5. In accordance with my instructions, the troops in Category B were used in the first instance byCommands to comply, as far as possible, with Home Office requirements. Such mechanical transport as was available in Commands was used to convey these troops to their strike stations, and the War Office, at my request, took the necessary steps to supply ihe mechanical transport required to render mobile the troops in category A, but it was only after an interval of 3-4 days that the motor lorries despatched by the WarOffice began to arrive at their destinations.6. The movements to strike stations were carried out with every despatch possible, but were delayed,by want of transport. This delay was especially serious in the Northern Command, where important pointscould not be guarded until 1st October.7. On the 28th September, I considered it necessary to reinforce the London district by one infantry brigade from Aldershot, This was effected one battalion at a time, owing again to scarcity of transport and completed on the 1st October.8. On the 29ih September, owing to representations from the Railway Executive Committee. I orderedone Cavalry Brigade and one Infantry Brigade from Tidworth to Gloucester,.^ route for duty in SouthWales; a&apos;id on the same date it became advisable to despatch the Headquarters and two battalions of theLight Reserve Brigade from Cannock Chase to Birmingham.9. The troops at Gloucester eventually moved to Newport and Monmouth on 2nd October.10. No serious attempts at sabotage or violence occurred, nor did the troops come into collision withthe strikers, and between lst/&apos;4th October, many detachments guarding vulnerable points and railways wererelieved by Police and Special Constables.11. On the 4th October, however, the situation promised to develop into a general strike, and I thoughtit advisable to suggest the reinforcement of the troops at Home by two Divisions to be brought from theContinent.12. On the 5th October the strike was settled.13. Shortly summarized, the troops actually used in this strike may be stated as follows: (a.) For protection purposes, and used in detachments(J.) Complete units moved to positions of readiness   ..(e.) Held in reserve by Commands(d.) General Headquarters, Reserves......In the matter of mechanical transport, 2,500 lorries were used for the conveyance of troops and forthe purposes of supply.14. The experience gained in the strike should be of great value in determining the principles underwhich the armed forces of the Crown should be employed under similar circumstances in the future, whileit also provides an opportunity to review and determine the relative functions of the police and the army.15. The principle hitherto laid down that it is the primary duty of the police &quot;to maintain the King&apos;&amp;peace&quot; has been departed from in many instances in the several strikes that have taken place this year, and both naval and military personnel have been used to carry out duties which do not correctly appertain tothose services.   Two instances may be quoted: (a.) The use of naval personnel to pump the Yorkshire mines under military protection.\b.) The guarding of essential railway lines, &amp;c, at the outset, by the army at the request of the HomeOffice.16. The real reason underlying this departure from accustomed practice was doubtless the consideration that, with the exception of London, the police forces throughout the country were insufficient to cope witha new condition of things.(7(585)(13&quot; I &apos;623,000.battalions,cavalry regiments.59 battalions.14 battalions.3 cavalry regiments.
In order to secure in the first instance the protection of railways and other vulnerable points, which inthe recent strike were guarded by the army, it is, therefore, important to form at once a Citizen Guard to supplement (he police. It is to this Citizen Gunrd that the Government must look primarily to reinforce thepolice for the piotection of property and maintenance of order, and its numbers must be such as will enable it to fulfil tlie^e duties.17. On the assumption that the army in Great Britain will shortly be reduced to: 4 Regular divisions   ..      ..      ........      ...... 48 battalions  infantry brigade    ..      ..      ..............4     ,,And, in addition, that the Highland and Eastern Divisions will remain for thepnsent   .. .. ..      .,      ........ 20Also the Guards battalions will number    ..      ..      ........ 10The total available will be8218. Recent experience would seem to show that in the event of serious industrial unrest developing,this force would be inadequate to meet all the demands likely to be made on it. It is, therefore, all the more necessary (a.) That it should be suitably located.(h.) That it should be highly mobile.19. To secure (b) it will be essential to maintain, or to have immediately available on the necessityttrising, motor transport, including reliable drivers and repair shops, on such a scale as will enable: Lorries.(1.)
