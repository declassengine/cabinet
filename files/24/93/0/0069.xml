THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0 A B I N E j..THE,   SYRIAN   QUESTION *Qovy of a Letter from His&apos; Highness vthe Emir Peisalto the ^rlme&quot;^Minx3;oer*Paris.   6th November., 1919.The.Right Honourable D. Lleyd-George,Prime Minister of Great Britain.Your Excellenoy,I same to Paris as, you advised and have been here aboutfifteen days.     I have done my best to keep on good terns withthe French Government, endeavouring to eliminate misunderstand-ings and to meet our mutual interests.     In fact I even t^ldM. Bertholot and M. Gout that I am ready to write a letter tothe French Government in whioh I will guarantee to uphold Frenchinterests in Syria thereby giving them full confidence in mygoodwill and proving that I shall take no stand against them inthe future.     I also Invited them to discuss with me, through acommittee which shall be held for that purpose, the withdrawalof British troops and the type of administration thereafter suitable for maintaining the unity af the country.     I fully explain-ed to them all my reasons for this but you will see by the en-closed letter      *       that M. Clemenoeau does not approve ofsuch a procedure.Today I lunched with hU Berthelet andthmvgfcft  Juris-he intendedto diBouss the present situation with me.    However it was evi-dent later that ha intended te have rae talk with General Gourr.ua,who was also present.    As soon as we left the table M*Bertheletwithdrew and left me alone with the General.     We had a long talksimilar to my previous conversations with other officials.     Ir.this case there was a slight difference, for the General admitted that the Arabs were right and that they cannot accept the divin-icn   of their country.-    He expressed his sympathy, but told mahe would be obliged to carry out all orders he might receive.Ho further said that although he disapproved of bloodshed hecould not hesitate to meet if if his orders required it.This is a brief summary of what has happened in Paris, andwill prove to Your Excellency that I havo made every effort toreach an agreement with the French Government., and that I havedone my best to continue with them my ever peaceful policy.   Ihare been obliged to rofer the entire matter to the Supreme Coun-cil, trusting they will take it in hand and save me from bearing the responsibility of any unfortunate outcome.     I abhor blood-shed but I see that ths French Government may bring it about by insisting on the withdrawal of the British troops and the upheav--k al of the present regime in Syria, before any step is taken, to reassure the people as to the future of their country and the unity of the administration. &apos;3g 0 pi3.P. 165..P.114)
The Arab Syrian Nation will do everything in their power todefend their independence and this unity, and they intend to make every effort in this connection.    Are the British Governmentand your country willing to stifle national feeling in Syria andto expose the innocent to annihilation.    I wish greatly to knowyour ideas on this subject &quot;because I earnestly desire to followyour advice in all these matters.1 beg, therefore,  for your assistance before the supreme council as you have kindly given it before in your approval ofassembling a special mixed Commission.       Without that we can never put an end to the present disagreement.I have the honor to be,Your Excellency1a obedient Servant,(Signed) PE1SAL.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.21st November 1919.
