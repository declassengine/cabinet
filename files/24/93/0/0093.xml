A--* IJ   COMMITTEE    01&quot; GOVBRHMBNi?&apos; Off   IR5LAHD   BILL.Explanatory Ho to on too &quot;financial Clauses..Tho accompanying clauses Coal with Irish finance -(1)   During tho period before the transfer of income.tax toIreland; (2) Luring the period after such transfer.The clauses are drawn on tho assumption that tho transferwill not take place unless and until the two Parliaments ofSouthorn and northern Ireland agree that tho Lrvying andcollection of income tax should go over to tho Central Body.(1).   The scheme for the first poriod is to give to Irelandsimply an amount equal to tho cost -V tho Exchequer of theUnitod Kingdom fat tho time of transfer) of such service as are for the time being transferred to Ireland, aftordeducting an amount equal to the Irish proceeds (at the time of transfer) of such taxes as are at the outset transferred toIreland, l.e, doath duties, stamp duties, excise licenceduties., and a few others.     This would just enable ireland to pay hor way, but would leave no margin whatever to coverincreased cost due to the splitting up of services betweenSouth and Ilorth, or any automatic increase in cost ofadministration..    To meet these contingencies and also to meetthe large increases in expenditure on housing., education&amp;o..., which ponding legislation will entail a free gift is madeto Ireland of her land.     This is effected by the Governmentof the United Kingdom assuming all liability for theinterest and sinking fund charges in respect of stock whichhas hitherto been issued to effect land purchase in Irelandand which may hereafter be issuod in order to ccmploto thesystem of land purchase, and by Ireland, on the other hand,
being given tho right to collect ana receive tho landpurohaae annuities and being given all oxisting accumulatedsinking funds.    Tho lattor and so much of tho purchaseannuities as roproaonts repayment of capital will boavailablo for capital expenditure, tho rest can be used asrevenue.The present amount of the annuities is between 3,000,000 and  3,500,000, of which, roughly 5/6tbsreprasent interest, and one-sixth sinking fund.    Thecapital sum representing accumulated sinking fund paymentspayable to Ireland will be 4 million pounds.(8).   After the income tax is transferred to IrelandIreland will retain hor rights with respect to landpurchase annuities, &amp;c, but otherwise the wholefinancial systom will be altered.Ireland is made liable to contribute her share ofImperial liabilities and expenditure, viz. debt charges,and expenditure in respect of defence (including pensions)foreign and colonial affairs, and a few other services.The proportion is provisionally fixed at one-fortieth,but is mado subject to revision according to taxable cap-aclty at the end of each year during.tho first five years,and thereafter at the end of oach quinquennial period.As security for this contribution, the Governmentof the United Kingdom will retain customs and excise duties collected in Ireland, and will pay over to Irelandher share of these duties after deduoting the amount cfthe Irish contribution to Imperial expenditure.    should this be insufficient, Ireland will havo to contributetho difference, but it ib mado clear that to secure pay-ment the Parliament of tho&apos; United Kingdom may iraposoadditional taxation on Ireland. .The proceeds of the income tax levied by the Central* Body- 2 -
Body in Ireland and tho share of Ireland in tho proceeds of the duties reserved to tho Imperial Parliament fsofar as those proceeds are not applied in satisfaction of Ireland&apos;s contribution to Imperial expenditure)will be paid into the all-Ireland consolidated fund; andso far as nob required to moot expenditure on suchsorvicos as may for tho time being bo administered by theCentral Body will be apportioned between the Governmentsof Southern and northern Ireland, and. available for expenditure on the services administered by those twoGovernments respectively.VJhitehall Gardens, 5.17.1.25th November, 1919.- 3 -
