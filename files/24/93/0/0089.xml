THIS DOCTOIIT 18 THE PJjPHRTY fVp HIS BKITAIHTIO i/IA JTSTY1 S CjOTOUTMT )CP. 165 Hemorajauum by the President of . the Board of Education.A Bill dealing with Public- libraries- is urgently necessary because, owing to the increase in tho cost of salaries, etc.,the statutory penny rate available for the support of PublicLibraries is no longer sufficient for their maintenance, andmany Libraries are finding at the-present time that theyCunnot give any war bonus, to their staff and are in doubt whether they can carry on operations until the end of theFinancial Year,    The draft Bill removes the existing limit on the amount of the rate which can be raised for the purposeof Public Libraries.Apart from this, the Bill is an enabling Bill,     Itenables County Councils whioh have not hitherto been LibraryAuthorities to establish Public Libraries in areas which donot at present enjoy them.     Such a provision is necessary because with the aid -of the Carnegie Trust many LocalEducation Authorities have been establishing or contractingto maintain rural Libraries without any sufficient legalauthority,.    The Bill enables County Councils and CountyBorough Councils which are Authorities- for the purposes ofPart II. of the Education Act, 1902, to delegate the controlof Public Libraries to their Education Committees, and thoseEducation Committees may delegate to Sub-Committees.    Theobject of this is to make it clear that the provision ofPublic Libraries is a proper function of Education authorities for the purposes of higher education,    Local Education Auth-ori-ties for the purpose of higher education are also given powersof compulsoriiy acquiring land for the purpose of Publiclibraries..     It is. proposed to omit Clause 7, because itraises difficult questions as to the existing powers of LocalEducation Authorities, and as to expenditure and grants inrelation to the Education Act, 1918,The Bill does not interfere with any existing library are r.and any library at present in existence may be conducted as heretofore,., but a Library Authority in a county area isenabled to transfer its library to the County Authority for higher Education.The Bill does not -impose any charge on the Exchequer.PUBLIC LIBRARIES BILL.H.AJi, FISHER&quot;Board, of Education, S..W24th IIovembor ,1919.
