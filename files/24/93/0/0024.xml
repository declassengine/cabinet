This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE CABINET.MEMORIALS ON BATTLEFIELDS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a paper on the erection on battle-fields of memorials to the British Army.Hitherto it has been left to the initiative of individual units to commemoratetheir own exploits, if they wish to do so, by the erection at their own expense of suchmemorials ; the necessary negotiations with the French and Belgian Governments arebeing carried out through the Battle Exploit Memorials Committee under theChairmanship of the Adjutant-General.This policy results in many very distinguished units of the Army not beingcommemorated at all, owing to a lack of funds, from which other units, with theirstrong financial and territorial associations, do not suffer.It is accordingly proposed that the Government, while not interfering with theerection of memorials by individual units, should erect at the public expense generalmemorials to the Army on the following typical battlefields : Ypres.Mons.Somme.Arras.Hindenburg Line.Gallipoli.Jerusalem.In Mesopotamia arrangements for a general memorial are being made locally.At Salonica a memorial is being erected by the units of the Salonica Army and in east Africa by the Indian Government.The preliminary designs for a memorial at Ypres, which comprise a restoration ofthe Menin Gate and a reconstruction of part of the ramparts, may be seen at theroom of the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, 10, Downing Street. It isestimated that this scheme will cost between 275,000/. and 325,000/.Designs for the other memorials have not been prepared, but it is anticipatedthat they will cost at least 175,000/. The total sum required to carry out theseproposals will accordingly be not less than half a million.The Dominions and the Government of India are providing money for theirmemorials from public funds, and it would only be consistent with the dignity of theImperial Government that it&apos;should not fall behind the Dominions and India in payinghomage to its soldiers., Before further action can be taken a decision is required as to whether memorialsto the Army generally are to be erected on battlefields at the public expense, and, if so,whether the Cabinet is prepared to authorize the expenditure of at least half a millionpounds.WINSTON S.

ERECTION OF MEMORIALS ON BATTLEFIELDS.I. Action already taken regarding Claims from Units,1. During the War a few units erected on battlefields memorials of a temporarynature to commemorate their actions with the enemy. At the end of the War anumber of units of the British Army, with a view to the erection of memorials of apermanent nature, approached individually the French Government direct for thepurpose of obtaining the necessary land and official sanction for erection of a monument.At an Anglo-French Conference, convened by Mons. Clemenceau and held at Paris inthe autumn of 1918 the following article of agreement was adopted : &quot; Toutes les fois que 1&apos;intervention du Gouvernement Francais sera necessaire pourfetablissement d&apos;un monument commenioratif devant rappeler un fait darmes de1&apos;Armee Britannique ou d&apos;une des unites qui la composent, la demande devra etrepresentee par le Commission imperiale des Sepultures Militaires. Si une demande de cette nature etait addressee directement au Gouvernement Francaise celui-ci 1&apos;renverraa. cette Commission, avant toute decision, et examinera, d&apos;accord avec elle, la suite quidoit lui 6tre rdservde.&quot;2. To this agreement the French Government attach great importance owing tothe number of independent requests that it was receiving for laud for memorials of thekind referred to. Consequent upon this article of agreement, the Army Council ayear ago set up the Battle Exploit Memorials Committee under the Chairmanship ofthe Adjutant-General to co-ordinate claims from individual units to erect permanentmemorials on battlefields. The Committee contain representatives of all ExpeditionaryForces except that in Mesopotamia and of all Dominions except South Africa and newfoundland, the former not desiring to be represented while representatives from thelatter attend such meetings of the Committee as affect their country.By means of Army Orders and notices in the Press, units were notified that their claims for memorials should be submitted to the Committee by the 1st September, 1919.The procedure adopted by the Committee is to refer each claim to the historical sectionof the Committee of Imperial Defence. If they and the Battle Exploit MemorialsCommittee see no historical reason why such claim should not be approved, the claim is forwarded to the Imperial War Graves Commission, who, in accordance with thearticle of agreement with the French Government referred to above, are the channel ofcommunication with the Government concerned.3. In the early summer of 1919, the Belgian Government offered to place at our disposal a number of plots of ground on the battlefields suitable for the erection ofmemorials. In accordance with their wish, the Battle Exploit Memorials committee held a Conference with the representatives of the Belgian Government, and it wasagreed that a suitable number of sites should be reserved by the Belgian government as far as possible in any scheme of reconstruction.4. Applications for permanent memorials have been received from a considerablenumber of units, from battalions upwards, and from all the Dominions. In view of thefact that the Dominion troops were being despatched home, and at the special request ofthe representative of Australia, who was anxious to use Australian labour in the erection of Australian memorials, the claims from the Dominions were immediately examined bythe Battle Exploit Memorials Committee, approved by them and forwarded to theImperial War Graves Commission for. transmission to the Governments concerned. TheAustralian memorials are actually in course of erection, if they have not already beenerected, and a representative of Canada is now visiting Brussels and Paris and arranging for the acquisition of the sites for the Canadian memorials. The indian government have notified the Committee that they wish to erect a general memorial to indian troops in each of the theatres of war where they fought.5. Consideration of other individual claims was postponed till all had beenreceived. The Committee have now reviewed these claims and. generally approved ofthem, except in the cases where more than one unit has claimed the same site, inwhich case the units concerned have been asked whether they would be-willing toamalgamate in a joint memorial.The Committee also felt that it would be more appropriate that the resources of a unit should be devoted to the erection of not more than one memorial in each theatre of war, rather than that such resources as they had should be dispersed in a number ofsmall and scattered memorials.
6. The Committee have undertaken to carry out the necessary negotiations withthe local land owners and the Governments concerned on behalf of and at the expenseof the units that desire to erect a memorial.7. With regard to the upkeep of memorials, the Imperial War Graves commission have been asked whether it is in a position to carry this out, as this Commission willbe the only permanent body that will have machinery suitable for such duties, andas it will already have to provide for the upkeep &quot;of the cemeteries and graves inFrance and elsewhere.8. The total number of claims for memorials received is over 110. Particularsas to design, actual site and expenditure have not been received in all cases, but assoon as they have been received application will be made through the War graves commission to the foreign Governments concerned.II. Proposals regarding the Erection, at the Public Expense, of Memorialsto the British Army Generally.9. The policy of the Committee, which had originally been to leave to theinitiative of individual units the erection of memorials on battlefields, would inevitablyresult in the exploits of many distinguished units remaining unrecorded, as only thoseunits which could command sufficient money would be in a position to commemoratetheir victories by a memorial in stone. For instance, whereas the 55th (WestLancashire Territorial) Division is prepared to spend many thousands of pounds on itsmemorial, the 1st Division does not propose to erect a memorial at all. This situation was examined by a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Lieut.-General Sir H. V. Cox,K.C.B., K.C.M.G., C.S.I., who emphasized the advantages from the point of view ofdignity and history in the policy of erecting a few large memorials commemorating theBritish Army generally, over a policy which would result in scattering France andBelgium with a large number of insignificant and inaccessible memorials erected by individual units.10. After considering General Sir H. V. Cox&apos;s proposals, the Committee came to theconclusion that it would be impossible on grounds of finance and sentiment to expect the various units that had already applied for memorials to sink their own wishes and resources and combine with others in the erection of a general memorial, possibly on abattlefield upon which they had never fought.11. The Committee were, however, impressed with the fact that all the Dominionsand the Government of India were prepared to find money for the erection at the public expense of general memorials to the exploits of their troops. The Committee accordinglycame to the conclusion that while individual units should continue to be allowed to erect-such memorials, it was their duty to recommend that the exploits of the British Armygenerally should be adequately commemorated, and with this in view they have putforward provisional suggestions for the erection of general memorials to the British Armyon typical battlefields.12. The places on which it is suggested that these memorials should be erectedare as follows: Ypres.Mons.Somme.Arras.Hindenburg Line.Gallipoli.Jerusalem.The Committee propose that if these memorials are erected it should be at the public expense.13. As regards Salonica and Mesopotamia, arrangements are being made locallyfor the general commemoration of the exploits of the Army in these theatres. in east Africa the Indian Government propose to erect an official memorial to the indian troops who fought there.III. Proposals Regarding Ypres.14. Some publicity has been given to. the question of treating the ruined city of ypres in a special way as a memorial for the British Army, and the Committee havemade considerable preliminary progress towards the preparation of the scheme forcommemorating its defence by the British Army.
APPENDIX A.Extract from a report by Sir Reginald Blomfield, R.A., on a proposed NationalMemorial at Ypres.&quot; I inspected the following sites : (a.) A site on the Grande Place.(b.) The Lille Gate and the adjacent British Cemetery.(c.) The island south-west of the Lille Gate.(d.) The Menin Gate and the ramparts.2. (a.) The site on the Grande Place is an oblong piece of ground lying to the east of the Cathedral. The depth of the site east and west is about 180 feet, and the lengthon the central axis north and south (the south end being canted off) is about 400 feet.The front is to the Rue de Dixmude, only the south end facing the Grande Place. Forthe following reasons I do not consider this a good site for the proposed memorial : (i.) If the Cathedral and Cloth Hall are rebuilt they would dominate a memorialbuilding in their immediate neighbourhood. If they are not rebuilt, butare left as ruins, such an association would, I submit, be unsuitable for a memorial of the heroism of the British Army at Ypres.(ii.) Owing to the position and shape of the site, a building would have to rimnorth and south, and its principal front would thus face to the Hue deDixmude, a narrow and insignificant street. r(iii.) A building on this site would have no particular association with the workOf the British Army, such as could be given by the Menin Gate and theramparts.(iv.) This site offers nothing like the opportunity for monumental design afforded by the rampart site.15. In July, 1919, a Conference was held at Ypres with the Belgian authorities and itwas agreed that the site of the Cloth Hall and Cathedral should be railed off,&apos; and thatno reconstruction should take place there pending the decision as to the use of such site.16. It was further agreed that the Menin Gate and ramparts at Ypres should be preserved in their ruined state, pending the report on the proposals to reconstruct them,also as a memorial to the British Army.17. The Committee, after deliberation, decided in. favour of the Menin Gate andthe ramparts as a site for a memorial, in -accordance with the recommendations ofSir Eeginald Blomfield, R.A., who visited and reported on the available sites. an extract of his report is printed as Appendix A.Preliminary plans for the reconstruction of the Menin Gate and the ramparts havenow been prepared by Sir Beginald Blomfield, R.A., which includes the erection of anarc de triomphe and the laying out of the ramparts at either side in the form of a garden.These preliminary designs (of which a short account is given in Appendix A) may beseen in the Private Secretary^ room, 10, Downing Street. The cost of this schemeis estimated by Sir Reginald Blomfield at 325,0007., if carried out in Portland stone, and275,000/. if carried out in Euville stone.IV. Question of Finance.18. With regard to the finance involved in the erection of general memorialsto the British Army all over the world, it is to be observed that both the Dominionsand India are preparing to find the necessary funds from the public purse;Australia has erected sorrie of her memorials and it is understood that Canada isprepared to find 500,000 dollars as a preliminary grant. It is submitted that it would only be consistent with the dignity of the Imperial Government that it should not fallbehind the Dominions and India in commemorating the achievements Of our&apos; troops onthe battlefields in a manner worthy of the memories associated with them.19. If the Ypres scheme is approved it will cost as stated above from 275,000/. to325,000/. No actual estimate of the cost of the other memorials has yet beenobtained, but the total, involved could not very well be less than 175,000/., makinga total of some half a million pounds.20. Before further action can he taken a decision is required as to whether theGovernment are prepared to find such a sum of money for erecting permanentmemorials on the battlefields to the British Army generally.
1.16For these reasons I advise against the Grande Place site.(6.) The Lille Gate and the British Cemetery to the south of it. The width of waterin the moat at this point makes this an attractive site, seen from outside the city. Butin my opinion the following reasons make it impracticable : (i.) The Lille Gate has existing its three engaged circular works, and as these would have to be preserved, it would be impossible to erect here an adequatetriumphal archway.(ii.) The brick retaining wall of the ramparts stops at the Lille Gate. To the west of the gate there is only an irregular bank at a lower level than the rest ofthe ramparts. Unless, therefore, an entirely new wall were built at thispoint, there would be no possibility of the balance in sthe compositionessential in a design of this character.(iii.) The close proximity of the small British Cemetery adds to the difficulty.There is no room in the cemetery plot for a monumental memorial, or for a memorial between the cemetery and the gate.(iv.) Although the wall to the east of the gateway is a good deal damaged byshellfire, this part of the ramparts did not bear the brunt of the attack, andon historic grounds is less suitable for the memorial than the Menin Gateand adjoining ramparts.(c.) The Island site to the south-west of the Lille Gate rises from the inner moat toits south-west extremity, and would form a fine site for a building; indeed, I under-stand that the Church Army are inviting funds for the erection of a church on this island. I submit, however, that this site is too inaccessible and too far away from themain centres of interest in Ypres to be a suitable site for the proposed memorial.(d.) In my opinion, the Menin Gate and adjoining ramparts are by far the mostsuitable site for such a memorial.(i.) On historical grounds it is the part most closely associated with the defenceof the British Army.(ii,) With the adjoining ramparts it offers unequalled opportunities for monumentaldesign,(iii.) The whole of the site and the gateway is open and unimpeded. The gatewayappears to have been removed long before the war and there is now nothingon the site to prevent the design taking any form that is desired.On these grounds I strongly recommend the Menin Gate and adjoining rampartsas the site for the memorial to the British Army.&quot;
