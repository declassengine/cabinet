This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government. 228&apos;   3 &apos;&apos;CABINET.NATIONALIST MOVEMENT IN TURKEY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate, tor the information of my colleagues, a letter from General sir george Milne.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.18th November, 1919.From General Sir G. F. Milne, G.O.M.G., K.C.B., D.S.O., to the Secretary ofthe War Office.General Headquarters, Constantinople,20th October, 1919,Sir,I have the honour to forward a Memorandum on the Nationalist Movement inTurkey, which is in my opinion an accurate and balanced account of events muchmisrepresented in Europe, but the military importance of which, it is essential, shouldnot be underestimated.2. In the first place, the movement has consolidated public opinion in Turkey, and,now that its supporters hold the reins of power, will do so still more.3. In the second place, its leaders have been coquetting Math the idea of armedresistance. No one can be better aware than they themselves that, in doing so, theyare playing with fire and risking a disaster to their country. It was, however,necessary for them to adopt this attitude for two reasons : (a.) Because it serves as a veiled threat, which they believe will influence thePeace Conference.(6.) Because the organization of the populace in a military way is the normalmethod of political agitation in Turkey., Military organization is the onlyorganization which the Turks understand, and the steps taken by theNationalist Party are admirably calculated to bring all the political powerinto their hands, and to make the results of the coming elections a mereinstrument of their will.4. It is, therefore, advisable to contemplate a situation in which the Use ofmilitary force may become necessary and to consider it in the light of possible decisions to be arrived at by the Peace Conference.5, I do not desire in any way to influence these decisions, but it is proper to pointout that the force required to enforce the Peace terms will vary greatly according tothe nature of these terms.6. The three main questions, on which Mustapha Kemal and his followers in then-defence of the integrity of their country, declare a &quot; non-possumus,&quot; are the questionof Smyrna, the question of Armenia and the question of Thrace.7. The question of Smyrna is important. The events of Smyrna have affected theposition so greatly that it is inevitable that its evacuation and return to Turkey will be one of the foremost demands of every Turk.8. In Armenia the crux of the question is that there are very few Armenians, andthat the more grandiose schemes for the creation of an independent Armenia wouldrequire large forces. Feeling on the subject is intense. Even Damad Ferid&apos;s Cabinetissued the - most stringent orders that no Armenians were to be allowed to be repatriated. It is, nevertheless, quite possible that there is a prospect of asatisfactory settlement without the use of force, provided that settlement is withincertain limits.9. The evidence upon which this is asserted was obtained by the I. (e) branch ofmy staff, and can be studied in detail in a series of reports to the War Office.(b19/532)  90  11/19  h&amp;s 771 Iwo01525241
10. The true value can be put on these reports only if it be clearly realized thatthey are conversations between leading Turks, who have no idea that they are beingoverheard.11. These conversations are, therefore, of very jrreat value. They show the Turksclearly on the defensive on the Erzerum frontier. They prove that the probability ofan offensive against Armenia may be discounted. They also show that the Turkleaders are prepared to make concessions. For instance, Colonel Djavid Bey, theCommander of the XIth Division at Van, writes to his Corps Commander at Erzerum.He says fuel is a great difficulty and wood as dear as sugar. Therefore he proposes tobreak up the rolling stock on the Bayazid-Karaklis decauville. &quot; Although,&quot; he says,&quot; we may hope by the national movement to save much of our country, that part mustgo.&quot; Divisional commanders do not in practice express political views in the course of-discussing administrative questions unless they know that their superiors hold these views. It, therefore, appears that the Corps Commander, Kiazim Karabekir, who isthe backbone of the national movement on that frontier, considers some territorialconcessions inevitable.12. On the question of Thrace I have no reason to suppose that adjustments,would be considered inadmissible by the Nationalist Party.13. If the decisions of the Peace&apos; Conference are so drastic in the treatment ofTurkey that the older men, who have the spirit of compromise, are unable to keep thewilder spirits in check, then it will turn out that the National Movement has very greatly prejudiced the military position of the Allies. The population is armed and nowunited for the first time; it is difficult to calculate the force which might be availablein the event of a national rising.14. Between the solution without force and the action referred to as possible inthe preceding paragraph there are many other situations in which the Allied forcerequired will vary according to the degree of division of opinion among the Turks andthe extent to which the most balanced opinion amongst them can be brought on to our side. In order that the situation may be considered beforehand it is most important that a forecast of the peace terms should be presented to the Allied military authoritiesin time for them to consider what if any-additional force will be required to meetthe situation, which the announcement of the peace terms will create. In this wayalone there will be avoided a repetition of the incidents of Smyrna.The forces now at my disposal are only sufficient to bring pressure to bear on theGovernment at Constantinople, who may or may not be in a position to control thecountry.I have, &amp;c,G. S. Milne, General,Commanding-in-Chief, Army of the Black Sea.HlSTOEY OF THE &quot; NATIONAL MOVEMENT&quot; in TURKEY.1. Prior to the landing of the Greeks at Smyrna in May of this year, the Central&quot;Government in Constantinople, although weak, had sufficient authority in the provincesto ensure the carrying into effect of the terms of the Armistice with regard to thedemobilization of the army and the surrender of armament.2. During the period of the armistice up to May the steady flow intoConstantinople of the surrendered armament from the provinces was a sure indication that the leaders had no thought of further resistance. The only exception was,perhaps, General Kiazim Karabekir, General Officer Commanding at Erzerum, who,although he reduced the numbers of effectives and the armament of his corps, did not reduce them to the figures fixed.3. Until the middle of May all the commanders of corps sent in quantities of.armament to Constantinople. For instance, in May General Mustapha Kemal now the leader of the whole movement sent a large convoy of machine guns; whilstGeneral Kutchuk Djemal Pasha, now Minister of War, and a leading organizer of theNational Movement, sent in a large consignment from Konia. It is, therefore, obviousthat until the middle of May no thought,of resistance to the terms of the Peacewhich the Entente Powers might enforce had been contemplated.4. This view was confirmed by the reports supplied by a special branch of the intelligence Staff, which up to May had detected nothing tending to the movementwhich afterwards convulsed the country.5. The occupation of South-West Asia Minor by the Italians, the landing of the
Greeks in Smyrna, and the disastrous events which resulted thereupon, entirelychanged the situation. By the end of May the country was flooded with accounts ofwhat had occurred. These accounts, which naturally were exaggerated, came as agreat shock to the Turks, and had an unifying effect on the various factions into whichthe country was at that time split.G. The Nationalist Movement may be said to have had its origin as the result ofthese events. Another contributory factor which gave great impetus to the movementwas the ever-present fear that a portion of &quot;Eastern Anatolia was to form a newArmenian state, a proposal which had been much discussed both by the Armenians andin the European Press.7. About this time the surrender of armament from Central and Eastern Anatoliaentirely ceased.8. During June the creation of two different organizations, of whose exactrelationship to one another it is difficult to be certain, was reported.(a.) The first was an unofficial organization, kept very secret, and headed by RaoufBey, a sailor, lately Minister of Marine. This organization was engaged in sending men and money into the area near Smyrna, and I have little doubtthat itri main object was to make sure that, wherever there were Greektroops, there would be disorder.(6.) The second organization was the creation of General Shefket Tourgoud Pasha,Minister of War, in consultation with the Minister of the Interior. Hemapped out Asia Minor into Northern and Southern Inspectorates, andallotted to each a distinguished general and staff. These were given controlof the troops, and had a responsibility for public order to the Ministry ofthe Interior. The first two appointments were General Mustapha Kemalto the Northern Inspectorate and General &quot; Kutchuk&quot; Djemal to theSouthern Inspectorate. So far as one can ascertain this official organizationat its inception seems to have been intended to ensure the peace of TurkishAnatolia during a period of intense strain.9. Unfortunately the method adopted by Mustapha Kemal had the opposite result..He and his officers did everything in their power to stir up the people, by condemningthe action of the Allies with regard to the events which were occurring in the Smyrnadistrict. This agitation became so serious that it became necessary to demand thereturn to Constantinople of General Mustapha Kemal. General Mustapha Kemaldeclined to obey the orders of his Government.10. Early in July he went to Erzerum, and about the same time was joined thereby Raouf Bey from Aidin. At this time Mustapha Kemal, according to a most certainsource, sent a request to Haidar Bey, Vali of Van, calling upon him by secret means toraise certain Kurdish tribes against the British. About the 14th of July mustapha kemal, having been dismissed from the Army, announced his resignation and his intention of devoting himself to the work of saving his country.11. The first step taken was the summoning of the Congress at Erzerum, withdelegates from what are known as the Six Eastern Vilayets. This was the firstimportant meeting at which the Nationalist programme was discussed. There appearsto have been a good deal of disagreement at this Conference, but in the end a declaration was agreed upon (Appendix A).12. It will be noted that the underlying principle of this declaration is the defence-of the National rights. As a result of the defeat of the Ottoman Army by the british forces, the leaders of the movement were prepared to lose Mesopotamia, Arabia,Palestine and Syria, but were determined to defend, if necessary by force, the remainder of Turkey, which represented the home of the race. Two dangers to the integrity ofTurkey were mentioned in the declaration, which were to be opposed, if neceSsary, by force. The first was the division of parts of Anatolia amongst the Greeks andArmenians ; the second was the granting of any form of mandate, which would resultin the Ottoman Empire losing its independence, to the Powers.13. The first move which was proposed by the Congress with a view to carryingout this programme was to get rid of the Cabinet of the Grand Vizier, Damad Ferid, onthe grounds that it had done nothing to defend the national rights in Smyrna, andthat it did not. represent the country, as the House of Assembly had not sat since theArmistice and no elections had been held.14. The Congress expressed its loyalty to the Sultan and Caliphate. From theforegoing it will be seen that the movement was political rather than revolutionary, as.some assert.
15. Although the declaration was reasonable and dignified, and no anti-Ententeviews were expressed, there is no doubt that the propaganda which followed had an anti-Entente tone. This was to be expected, as the raison oVStre of the movement wasthe fear that the Entente proposed the partition of Turkey.16. Shortly after this Conference there appeared a flood of rumour and propagandaon the subject of raising armies. This was inevitable, and there had been stories ofthe kind before. No doubt steps were taken, as has been so often the case inTurkey, to organize the villages in a military way. The interesting point is the undoubted fact that Mustapha Kemal deliberately encouraged this propaganda. no british or American officer, who has visited the provinces, has seen any of the Nationaltroops unless a few disorderly bands are to be so classed ; but any who have been intouch with Mustapha Kemal or his followers have received accounts of the great success he has had, and the thorough organization adopted.17. The Kemal programme, in all probability, is: (a.) To organize the villages as best he could without taking men from their homes.(6.) To maintain complete order in Anatolia, and to refrain from any aggressionacross the pre-war frontier.(c.) To get rid of the Government of Damad Ferid, and to substitute a Governmentwhich would furnish a delegation to the Peace Conference capable ofmaking a dignified protest upon the basis of Wilson&apos;s fourteen points.(d.) To avoid any immediate clash with the Allies, and reserve to his party such powers of compromise as would put him in the position of being at once the saviour of his country, and able to come to a settlement with theEntente.A copy of a memorandum addressed by Mustapha Kemal to the Allied high commissioners is given in Appendix B.18. Basing themselves on this programme, Kemal and his associates continued toorganize the country. As a preliminary step to the overthrow of Damad Ferid, hesummoned the Conference of Sivas, which met in the first week of September. It willbe noted that the opening address of Mustapha Kemal (appendix C), the copy ofwhich is believed to be reliable, is couched in a more anti-Entente tone than theErzerum declaration.   The resolutions of the Sivas Congress form Appendix D.19. The Sivas Congress differed from the Congress of Erzerum in that itsdelegates came from the whole of Turkey.^ It decided upon the step of seizing the telegraph offices all over the country and thus cutting off the Constantinople Govern-ment from its supporters in the provinces.20, From the point of view of the Nationalists this step was eminently successful.It must be remembered that the army in the provinces, though a mere cadre, wasaltogether on the Nationalist side. Small parties of soldiers moving about the countryseized the telegraph offices without difficulty. The result of the tactics adopted wasthat the whole of the administration of the area along the Anatolian Railway, whichso far had remained faithful to the Government, came under the control of the nationalists.21. These events were accompanied by another storm of propaganda in constantinople, which had obviously had its echo in the European Press. Christianand Moslem alike had the same interest to represent tho case as not politics but war.The Greeks desire to push the Entente into a fresh war with Turkey, in order that the fate of their hereditary enemy may be settled for ever. The more fanatical Moslemsare anxious that the movement of Mustapha Kemal shall be considered the mobilizationof an army. Both sides, therefore, spoke freely of battles, armies, the execution ofopponents and the fall of towns; although no one had been killed and few evenarrested.22. A further difficulty was the belief of the Government of Damad Ferid Pashathat the despatch of a few thousand troops from Constantinople would restore thesituation. There can be no doubt of the genuineness of this belief on their part; andno doubt it is true that they have many supporters, and that the bodies of Nationalisttroops moving about were small and mere escorts for agitators. The Government inthe last week of September asked for permission to move troops.23. In view of the importance of preserving peace and the avoidance of commit-* The resolution of this Conference is given in Appendix D.
ments, which might have serious reactions elsewhere, it was felt that a mere preference for a Government of a particular political.colour dip! not justify the risk of encouraginga civil war, in which it would have been almost impossible that Allied troops should remain spectators. Accordingly the movement of Government troops was not allowed;and there followed the downfall of the Ferid Cabinet and the entry into power of whatis really a Nationalist Government. &apos;24. The Government and its supporters in the provinces are now acting withperfect propriety towards the Entente.. \ A copy of their Proclamation on taking office is given in Appendix E.At no time during the Nationalist Movement were the cables of British officersinterfered&apos;;with. Public order in Turkish-governed Anatolia is fully maintained.Proclamations throughout the country call upon the Moslem to obey the injunction ofthe Koran to treat the stranger as a guest. Verbal guarantees of safety to the christian are constantly repeated ; and it was part of the oath at the Congress of Sivasthat no delegate should either seek his own personal interest or have anything to do with the Committee of Union and Progress:Although no recruiting for the regular Turkish Army is being carried out by the nationalists, there is undoubtedly an attempt to form a Nationalist Militia byregistering villagers, who mostly possess arms of sorts, to collect money for theNationalist cause. In some cases those men have been assembled, and sent to reinforce the bands opposing the Greek forces in Aidin. It must, however, be clearly noted thatin some areas affected by the National Movement no attempt has been made to carryout orders regarding the disposal of arms and ammunition, and in this respect Article of the Armistice terms has been infringed.Issued by General Staff Intelligence,Army of the Black Sea, Constantinople.  -20th October, 1919.
APPENDICES.APPENDIX A.COMMISSION REPRESENTING THE EASTERN ANATOLIAN SOCIETY FOR THE DEFENCE &apos;OP THE EIGHT OP THE NATION.Proclamation by the Congress of the Eastern Anatolian Vilayets at Erzerum. . ; -Erzemm,  &apos;;;;&apos;r7th August, 1919.In the presence of the injurious transactions that have followed one another since the Armistice&apos;was signed; the actual occupation of important parts of our country, as Smyrna, Adalia, Adana and theneighbourhood; the Greek atrocities committed in the vilayet of Aidin; the Armenian preparations for an occupation, and their policy of general mussacre and death to the Moslems reaching now to our-frontiersiu the Caucasus; the inroads of foreign Greeks from Russia, calling themselves refugees, but in realitycoming to the Black Sea coast with no other object than realizing once again their dream of a PontusState, and making preparation for that, and the movement in and out of armed bands of brigauds in thepresence of all this our nation, seeing with great sorrow the danger of our country being divided andbroken up, is convinced that the Central Government, acting without the support of any national decision,will be unable to remedy those disasters, as is proved by the above examples, and will probably be compelled under various influences to submit to greater mischiefs and more unacceptable vexations.The vil iyets of Eastern Anatolia, therefore, seeing themselves in imminent danger, have undertaken toprotect themselves with the assistance of Societies of Patriots from every part, and have closed theCongress, held at Erzerum on 7th August, with the following resolutions :  ...   &apos;.(1.) The policy is inadmissible of separating for any reasons whatever from the Ottoman motherland&apos;or one from another, the vilayet of Trebizond with the Saudjak of Janik, those vilayetsknown as Eastern Provinces, viz., Erzerutn, Sivas, Diarbekir, Mamurat el Aziz, Van Bitlis tandthe independent sub-divisions of provinces within this area. All Moslem elements living within this area are filled with a reciprocal sentiment of sacrifice, and have undertaken to&apos; aim at thesame object as regards the future of their country, and cling to their blood and racial bonds.(2.) To put in action 1he forces of the nation; to impose the will of the nation in order to maintainthe integrity of the Ottoman motherland and the independence of our nation, and to preserve the Sultanate and Caliphate.(8.) The principle has been agreed upon of a common action for a rising in defence against anyoccupation or interference, or any movement of which the object is to make the country eitherGreek or Armenian. The grant of further privileges to Christian elements, such as would destroy the equilibrium of our agglomerations and our political supremacy, will not be recognized.(4.) Decisions have been given, and measures taken, to guarantee our attachment to the Sultanate andCaliphate, and our national existence and rights in the case when the Central Government, underpressure from the Powers, finds itself compelled to abandon or neglect these parts.(5.) We shall respect all the rights acquired by the non-Moslem elements in our country and confirmed by the laws of the Ottoman Government. The respect for other people&apos;s life, lands and propertybeing already one of our religious duties, national traditions and legislative principles; this point was confirmed with the general consent of our Congress.(6.) We hope that the Entente will abandon the idea of dividing our country which was within ourfrontiers when the Armistice was sighted on the 30th of November, 1918, in which, as in theother districts in the Eastern Anatolian vilayets, the Moslems are obviously in the majority;in which the agricultural and commercial superiority is in the hands of the Moslems ^ in whichthe inhabitants, brothers by origin and religion, cannot be separated. We hope that our existence,our historical, religious and racial rights will be respected, and all contrary measures avoided;and thus a decision in conformity with right and justice will be carried out.(7.) Our nation holds in great honour, and aims at, civilization and progress, and realises our positionand wants in science, industry and commerce. We are, therefore, pleased to accept the scientific,industrial and commercial assistance of any nation, which does not look forward to an occupationof our country, aud is respectful of our national rights within the limits fixed in the 6th paragraph;provided that the integrity of our country and its independence are maintained in the interior and outside. It is our sincerest national desire readily to accept and welcome a peace based on theseequitable and humanitarian conditions.(8.) At this historical moment, when our nation decides its own destiny, the Central Government should submit to the will of the nation; since any government party not supported by the nation notonly fails to see its personal decisions obeyed by the nation, but its credit outside is also non-existent ; and that it cannot exist has been proved by the action taken and the results obtained inthe past. Without, therefore, letting the nation itself find the means of emerging from its troubleand anxiety, the Government must at once invoke the National Assembly, and must submit to thecontrol of the nation all decisions concerning the destiny of the people and country.(9.) The group formed by the union and agreement of all the societies with the same object, broughtinto existence by the national consciousness of the unfortunate events in our country, has taken the name of Eastern Anatolian Society for the Defence of the Rights. This society is outsideany &quot; party &quot; influence.  All our Moslem countrymen are natural members of the society.   *(10.) An elected Representative Commission has been accepted by the Congress, and all &quot; nationalformations &quot; from village up to vilayet have been amalgamated and confirmed.Bureau of thk Congress.
idAPPENDIX BTo H.E. General Solly Flood, at Eskishehr.(To be forwarded to the British High (Extraordinary) Commissioner, Constantinople.)Sivas,25th September, 1335/1919.1. By proclamations of the Congresses convoked in Erzerum in the name of Eastern Anatolia, and inSivas in the name of the whole Ottoman fatherland, dated respectively 7th September, 1335/1919 and11th September, 1335/1919, the nation wishes publicly to make known to the world their lawful purposewhich led to the present unity and organization; also their fellow-feeling of patriotism which theymaintain towards the non-Moslem elements.2. Although complete peace prevails in the whole Ottoman fatherland, inasmuch as without any distinction of religion or nationality the protection of personal freedom is being maintained, we are informedthat some ill-wishers are trying to attribute the movement which has sprung from the national conscience toa movement against the non-Moslem elements.On 16th September, 1335/1919, circular notes informed all the vilayets and dependent sub-provincesthat every subject of His Majesty possesses the same rights; also strangers in our country must be objects&apos; of Ottoman hospitality, provided that they are not discovered in any action against our country and ournation.The present demand of the nation is that, instead of the Ferid Pasha Cabinet, whose acts of treacheryto the country have been asserted, a lawful and trustworthy Cabinet which complies with the Nationalwishes should come to power.Therefore I beg to state and confirm the maintenance of peace existing in our country, and the safety of our non-Moslem comrades who are protected against any kind of attack.I remain, &amp;c,On behalf of the Representative Committee for protecting the rights of European and Asiatic Turkey,&quot;mustapha. kemal.APPENDIX C.THE OPENING ADDRESS OF MUSTAPHA KEMAL TO THE SIVAS CONGRESS.(Believed to be from a. reliable source.)- Gentlemen, ,1. You have been called together at Sivas to save the nation from the present difficult situation. Ithank you for the sacrifice you have made in coming here and hail your arrival. Before passing to the orderof the clay, I wish to make a statement to you.2. You are aware that the Powers of the Entente concluded an Armistice with us on the 30th November,1918. which contained certain promises regarding our national territory.Our nation believed in an equitable peace, but the conditions of the Armistice have been changed to ourdetriment.The Christian nationalities, encouraged and strengthened by the Allies, have commenced action against us.  In Western Anatolia the Greeks have committed terrible crimes under the very eyes of the Allies.The Armenians are spreading towards Kizil Irmak and have commenced their policy of massacres. Theyare working to create a kingdom from Fontus to the Black Sea.The districts of Adana, Marash and Konia have been occupied, and this foreign occupation has penetratedto the heart of the Turkish Government and to the very palace of the SultanDespite all protestations, the Government has -shown itself singularly incapable of dealing with thesituation.3. The nation, therefore, has been constrained to adopt an attitude of stern resistance. The Allies arepersuaded that Turkey has no will of her own, no mind and no blood (sic), and they believe that the presentsituation is in accordance with her deserts.But you, patriots and representatives of the InteUigentia, have cleared the mists which surrounded thispainful situation because you know that our nation still lives, because you have confidence in its future, and because you realize that weakness can only lead us towards the abyss.Gentlemen, in face of the injustice of the Entente Powers and the powerlessness of our Allies, theTurkish people has risen to defend its honour and its future by force of arms.4. In the eastern vilayets which were the theatre of the Armenian cruelties every kind of crime hasbeen committed. To save these vilayets to-day in mourning, and to save also the national honour,associations have been formed under the names of Mudafai Houkouki Millie (Defence of National Rights),and Muhafazai Houkouki Millie (Conservation of National Rights). In the vilayets of Diarbekir, which is threatened with danger from the east and from the south, has been formed the Mudafai Vatan Djemiyeti^Association for Defence of the Fatherland).5. In view of the probability of a Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, the Committee of the Defenceof the National Rights launched a counter-attack when the Greeks disembarked in our beloved country.National Committees were formed everywhere in Turkey, and the call of the Turkish nation from east to west has echoed even to the distant corners of Anatolia. Thus the national committees, which refuse to live in bondages to the enemy, have become national organizations born of the will and the conscience of thenation. Thanks to this fact our nation, which for centuries has been independent, has shown the world itsTvill to continue its existence.
C. Gentlemen, when it became clear that tiie national freedom could only be obtained through the wilt&apos;of the people themselves the Erzerum conference was organized. It was then decided that the present conference should be convoked.7. I regret to state that the Central Government has spared no effort to [stifle the voice of the nation,,and to prevent communication between tne various parts of the Empire, thus rendering us powerless before our enemies.  This action of the Central Government is the blackest page of our national history.  It is satisfactory to think that our honourable army, representing as it does the strength of the nation, hasfrequently addressed remonstrances to the Central Government.8. You will recollect that letters of invitation issued by the Erzerum Conference convoked the presentCongress for the 10th July, 1919, and we hud hoped that delegates from Smyrna and from the ErzerumConference might have been able to be present on that date. It was, however, nut found possible to convokeit until to-day, meantime negotiations with the delegates of the Erzerum Conference had been proceeding,and a complete agreement was arrived at with them on the principal points.The return of the delegation from Erzerum being necessary, iis members left for that city, having firstchosen certain persons to represent them in the present assembly. Beyond the declaration of the ErzerumConference, and tne programme which was drawn up, no secret decision was arrived at.9. The circular letter, which Eerid Pasha addressed to the people of Anatolia on his return from Paris,,was a matter of deep regret to the conference a dementi was immediately published with statement showing the real truth of the situation.   TheConference fun her insisted that elections of deputies should take place as early as possible.10. The Erzerum Conference being composed only of delegates from Eastern Anatolia, its competence-Was limited to that district. Such a conference had no light to speak for Anatolia as a whole, or torepresent the Association for the Defence of the Rights of Anatolia and Roumelia. To do so would havebeen to emulate the claim of those at&apos;Constantinople, who, in association with certain persons, desire todecide the national destiny and to represent the will of the nation.11. The Erzerum Conference wished to carry out the will of the whole nation and to work in agreementwith every province. This principle has been accepted. This Sivas Conference, which you have honouredby your presence, will prove that the country is one and indivisible, and that its people are united. It will doubtless draw up a programme to that effect.12. Gentlemen, the influence of the Central Government and the anti-constitutional steps which it hastaken to prevent the fulfilment of the national wish for the convocation of Parliament has recently changedunder the influence of the national movement. As you know orders have been given to proceed with theelections. It is by the grace of God and the strength of your will that this has come about. But there remains the question of acceptance of certain foreign mandates which would directly violate ourindependence.In order that the Government may not face us with an illegal fait accompli before the National Assemblyhas been convoked the continuation of a congress representing the national spirit will be necessary.13. In conclusion, I pray that the blessing of the Almighty may rest upon the labours of this Congress,.,whose aim is the safety of the nation.  ....The following oath was administered to the delegates at the Sivas Congress: &quot; I swear to pursue no personal interest, but to strive for the freedom of my country and the interestof the nation; I swear that I will not work for the Union and Progress or for the political programmeof any party whatsoever.&quot;kft &apos;__ .APPENDIX D.The Society for the Defence of the Rights of Anatolia and Turkey-in-Europe has held at Sivas a.Congress at which were taken the following resolutions published throughout Anatolia.The whole nation knows the interior and exterior perils which caused the nation to awake toconsciousness and brought into existence this our Congress, at which the following resolutions have beentaken: (1.) The various parts of the Turkish territory which remained within our frontier when, onthe 30th October, 1919, the Armistice concluded between the Entente Powers and the Turkish.Government was signed, are everywhere inhabited by an overwhelming Moslem majority and form a whole; they cannot be separated and would not, for any reason, detach themselves one-from another or from the Ottoman Motherland. All the Moslem elements living in those countries are true brothers filled with sentiments of mutual respect and feelings of sacrifice and areabsolutely respectful of the racial and social rights and local conditions.(2.) To secure the integrity of the Ottoman Motherland and our national independence, and preserve theSultanate and Caliphate, the principle has been adopted as essential of putting into action theforces of the nation and render the will of the nation preponderant.(3.) The lawful principle has unanimously been agreed upon to oppose and fight, as in the nationalmartyrdoms on the Aidin, Magnesia and Balekesor fronts, against any penetration in oroccupation of any portion of the Ottoman Empire, especially against any movement aiming at the-creation, within our country, of an independent Greek or Armenian place.(4.) All the non-Moslem elements with whom we live in the same country, having long ago had theirequality of rights of every sort fully guaranteed, the grant of such privileges as would break our political supremacy and social equilibrium will not be admitted.(5.) Every precaution and decision has been taken to safeguard the Sultanate and Caliphate and the integrity of the country and nation should the Turkish Government find itself, under some pressure from outside, compelled to abandon or neglect any portion of our territory.(6.) We expect the Allies to totally abandon the idea of breaking our national unity comprised withieour frontier of 30th October, 1918, when the Armistice was signed, where the large majority ofthe population is Moslem and the agricultural and social superiority belongs to the Moslems; to-respect its historical, ethnic, religious and geographical rights on those territories, cancel any action that is against the above and thus give a decision based on right and justice.
(7.) Our nation holds in honour humanitarian and modern aims, and realizes our scientific, industrial andeconomic position and wants. We therefore will accept with pleasure the scientific, industrial and economic assistance of any nation who respects the interior and exterior independence of ourstate and nation; who, provided that our country is kept untouched, admits the principles of nationality within the frontiers indicated in Article 6; and who does not look forward to an occupation of our country. The early conclusion of a peace on these equitable and humanconditions, too, for the sake of humanity&apos;s safety and peace in the world, is our nation&apos;ssincerest desire.(8) At this historical moment when the nations fix their own destinies, it is absolutely necessary thatour Central Government, too, should submit to the will of the nation; for past acts and corresponding results have proved that not only the decisions, personal and uncontrolled, of anycabinet not supported by the nation, are disregarded by the nation, but that abroad, too. sucha Cabinet has, and can have, no ctedit. Without, therefore, letting the nation find itself themeans of emerging from the trouble and anxiety in which it is, our Central Government must atonce convoke the National Assembly without loss of time and thus submit to the control of theNational Assembly all decisions concerning the destinies of the nation and country.(9.)
