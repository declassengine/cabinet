^feft^ the Prop Jy ofWOBKHBHfS obMpzmsAnoir (war App^tioy) BOX..(Circulated fcy the Home Secretary).7(7    -.....-i-iposed by this Bill&apos;- in view of the continued rise in cost of1o increase.the &quot;war addition&quot; payable under&apos;the W*rkmen&apos;s Compensation(War Addition) Aot.,1917, tt workmen in receipt of weekly payments for totaldisablement, from 26$ to 75$ of the weekly payment - this increase to apply onlyto workmen of 21 years of age and upwards.The weekly payment on which the War Addition is calculated will&apos; remain subject to the maximum limit of  1 fixed by the V/orkraen&apos;s Compensation Act* 1906*and even with the new increase the rise in compensation will not be proportionate to the general rise in prices and wages.The immediate origin of the Bill is a series of proposals agreed betweenthe Mining Association and Miners1 Federation which &quot;rere submitted to me inAugust last.     These proposals (limited to workmen of 21 years of age and upwards)were as follows:-(l) The 25$ war addition to be increased to 50$.(2) A Minimum compensation of  1 per week.(3) An additional 5/- per week to be given for each person whollydependent upon the disabled workman, subject to a total maximum of40/-.x4.1Steps have been taken to ascertain the views of employers in otherindustries and of the Accident Offices Association (which comprises almost allthe Insurance Companies affeoted).    The result of these inquiries indicates thatthere is a large measure of support for these proposals, and no aotiveopposition, and that the necessity of an increase of the war addition isgenerally recognised.     Proposals (2) and (3) however have been the subject of serious criticism and cannot in my opinion be defended in a temporary measure.They would introduce novel and controversial principles into the Workmen&apos;compensation Acts and would prejudioe the inquiry which is now being conductedinto the whole subject by the Departmental Committee on Y/orfemer^s Compensation..On the other hand I feel sure that if proposals (2) and (3) are omitted and onlyproposal (l) adopted,, this will not be sufficient to meet the requirements of thesituation, and I have come to the conclusion that the best course will be, whilerejecting the minimum compensation and dependency proposals, to raise the war-addition to 75$ (instead of 50$).;&apos; The Aooident Offices Association are prepared to indemnify employers inrespect of the additional liability for an increase of 10$ on existing premiums.Further, they have undertaken themselves to pay the increased compensation inCases vfhere the incapacity occurred before the commencement of the new Act.This undertaking will make it possible to apply the Bill (like the A*t of 1917)to existing as well as future cases.
Clause Z of the Bill proposes to extend the war addition to the few cases still outstanding under the Acts of 1897 and 1900 (repealed by theAct of 1906). By inadvertence the Act tf 1917 was not applied to thesecases, but arrangements were subsequently made by whfVoh the insurance companies and Mutual Associations agreed to treat these cases exactly onthe same footing as cases under the Act *f 1906.I am being pressed to introduce the Bill at the earliest possible moment, and I should be glad to be authorised to do so early next week,E.S.13th November, 1919.BSF78-7
