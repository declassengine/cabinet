With reference to V/ar Cabinet 622j, MinutePorts. 7, the V/ar Cabinet had under consideration the&quot;Report of a Conference on the Shipping Situationand the Congestion in the Docks (Paper G.T.8309).Some discussion took place as to paragraph 2 (a) s-&quot;That \ .e Ministry of shipping in consultation with the Ministryof TransportP should have authorityto block Government traffic at theport of shipment in cases wherethey are satisfied that the importwould add to. or cause congestiondue to lack of storage accommodation in this country.   Departments import-ins goods on Government account to berequired to show to the Ministry ofTransport how they propose to storethe goods in this country before,shipping facilities are arranged&quot;.It was explained that, owing to ihe&apos; absence of the Minister of Food in Brussels,&apos;at a meeting of the Supremo Economic Council,when the Conference in question was held,the recommendations contained in the Report&quot;had only recently come to his notice, andthat a Conference was to be held that afternoonbetween representatives of the Board of Tradeand the Ministry of Shipping to discuss the congestion of storage accommodation.The Uar Cabinet decided :-(a)   That a further meeting of theConference, under the Chairman-ship of Sir Eric Geddes, set upby &quot;Jar Cabinet 622 minute 7,should be held to discuss withthe Minister of Food the recommen-dations contained in paragraph2 (a) of the report. .
(&quot;b)   To approve tho following rocowniondationfl? ^That tho Storage;; ffo &apos; ittoo of theMinistry of Reconstruction should infuture act as a clearing-houso for theallocation of storage in tho hands of.Government Departments other than Inports, and should rake recommendations as to tho host use of available accommo-dation.&quot;That the Storage Qonmittoo bo transfer-red to tho Ministry of Transport.wTho following la a summary of tho decisionscorto to by tho Conference in regard to Paragraph 2 (a) ofmy Memorandum of September 19th (G.T.83O0).^.      The Conference decided:-That in Line 4 of Paragraph 2 (a), after thoword &quot;Satisfied&quot;, the following words shouldbe inserto.&quot; .&quot;after consultation with theDepartmental interested.&quot;The Pood Controller was of opinion that the insertion of those words would.moot his objections to-Paragraph 2 (a) which as it originally stood gave powers,to the Ministry of Shipping and tho Ministry of transport to block foodstuffs at tho port of shipment without consultation of tho Ministry of Food.8*      The attention of the Conference was drawn tothe serious effect of the congestion at the ports on Shippingentering United Kingdom ports.   ^Thilst the carrying po^orof such shipping should have increased by 45 per cent owingto the abolition of war restrictions and an increase in thenumber of ships, the increase in tho quantity of goods imported is only 10 per cent.   This enormous wasto ofcarrying power is attributed to the slowness with whichships are turned round in ports,, which is duo   n turn tothe fact ^na^ traders hold their goods in store at thoports or t.t railway terminals on the chance of using thocheaper carrying facilities of the railways.   As a consequence the railways are congested, and the detention of rolling stock at terminals is 56 per cent., above prewarfigures, whilst other carrying facilities., such as tholorries provided by the Government for   learing the   port of Bristol, are not being fully made use of.   The permanentcure for such a state of affairs will bo the raising of rail-way rato3 and I hope to effect this before the end of the year*In the meantime, the Conference recommend that goods whichare controlled by the Government, such as Thcat and timbershould if possible be diverted to canal or road, wheroveropportunity offers.The Oonfercnce have accordingly decided&apos;(l)     To appoint a Committee consisting of re-prosehtatives of the Ministry of Food, the
Ministry of Transport and tho Ministry of shipping to go into tho natter and if possible make arrangements for tho carriage of articlesunder Government control by methods otherthan tho railwaysx(2)     Subject to further examination thoextra cost of&quot; such carriage should bo bornoby the coastal subsidy., until tho railways are placed on an economic basis,As regards goods not controlled by tho government it is considered that there is no method of preventingexcessive imports except by moans of import prohibitions,,and the Conference doos not think that it &apos;-rould be possibleto ro-&apos;impose such restrictions at the present time.     Itis considered; however, that the situation might be improved if importers of bulky and non-essential goods suchas tobacco wore requested to restrict their importsvoluntarily,, and at the request of the Conference tho Boardof Trade have undertaken to consider thiso3o     Tho Conference also considered the Memorandum bythe Quartermaster-General (C.-.Pu3o) in regard to my previous report,    (Go 1,5309),   It was explained to tho Quartermaster-General1s representative that the arrangements outlined inparagraph (2) (,a) of my report wore not intended to apply tostores imported by the War Department for use by the Army underpeace conditions,, but only to purchases made by GovernmentDepartments on account of the war, such as wool, etcc - nor was it intended that the allocation of&apos; storage space should affectpermanent departmental storage04..     As regards paragraph. 5 (b) of my report (G*T,8509)tho Conference understand that tho Minister of - Munitionsis satisfied with the arrangements which have boon made for thodisposal of Army and Air. Force stores, most of which have been declared surpluse   Tho Admiralty arrangements for disposalof surplus stores are also nearly complete,Tho sanction of the. Cabinet Is asked for thoproposal that tho extra cost of carriage of articles undor Government control by methods other than Railways should be included inthe figure given for tho coastal subsidy, until tho Railways are placed on the economic basis, which should&apos;bo as early as theAdvisory Committoo on Hates can conclude their investigation-(Signed) Eric CoddescNovember 11th,1919c
