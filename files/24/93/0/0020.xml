Did I understand you to .say that the railway companies were prepared to undertake the construction?- SIR A.FELL - They havo been blocked for so long they havenot had time yet to do any practical work, except making calcu-.latiens and examining the plans,TH3 PRIMS IvIIHISTER - Are they convinced now on tho newfigures that it could be made to pay?SIR A,FELL - Certainly it would pay, and pay handsomely,THE 2RIHB MINISTER - Are the railway authorities convinced?SIR A FELL - Yes.   It would pay handsomely. (THS PRIME MINISTER - On both sides of the Rhannel?Rlfi- A-FELL- -

Mr,Adamson ?MR,, ADAjvISOII - If. I intervene for one moment it is to saythat personally I am whole hoarteddy in agreement with the other sections of the deputation,  as to tho a  vantages of&apos;such atunnol being made.   The party with which I am associated agreewith mo on that particular point, but I 531a not to be hold asagreeing to tho idea that the tunnel should be constructedby the two railway companies,.-THE PRIM3 iniliSTSR - I knew you. would not,   I glanced-at1you when that was referred to and I saw an indication of protest.-,MRo ADAMS01! - rro arc strongly of opinion that such an imp or-.tant line of communication should bo constructed by the twoGovernments involved *   \?e think that this moans of communicationis of such importance to tho two countries chiefly concerned that they should undertake its construction and retain its upkeepin their own hands,IE.:&quot;] PRIME MI1IISi&apos;ER - Is there&apos;any military opinion ?BRIGADIER GENERAL SUBiTEFS - I happen to be a soldier, andfor forty years I have been interesting myself in this  v::.rir.;,ol.vand I happen to knew a great deal about it ever since it was-undertaken; and I cannot see the slightest danger to this country,from making it,   I Lave never thought that there was any danger* -and I do not now think that there is auy0THE PRIME MIMISTFPi - I assume that you have gene into it very carefully and eorsiceied all the possibilities that theremay bo of a surprise attack and the.so5 ssixig of the bridgehead ?BRIGADIER GENERAL SUETEES
BRIGADIER., GSFilRAL SulRTEES: - Yes,   nd fcr&quot;roac^iij&quot;&quot;WiiloK-^v;,could give 1 ii:y th-i there in no--danger of th t kind.  ,. ggTHE PRIME MINISTER: - Why do you say that there is no danger of th: t kind new?BRIGADIER GEVERAL SURGES *\- There iu no danger ifcert; in simple precautions rre t;..ken.   Per instance there wouldhe ;   dip in the tr: ck which could &quot;be flooded;   ?:nd if it was thought necessary you could &apos; Yways blow it up, but thatwould be meet undesirrbic,THE PaIHE MINISTER?. - Plow would it bs blown up?BRIGADIER GENERAL SURTEEtj; - 3y touching a button, either in London or in Dover,   Then there would be a depression in thetrack which could be flooded at t. moments notice, and would stop,all possibility of the tunnel being used*   There is amples &quot;cUrity.SIR A, FELL; - We have ht,d m eting3 at which the militaryquestion. was the question discussed, but th^ military men now sqythat it is not a question of how .we Mr. flood the tunnel,, or how we may blow it up. but how yoa can preserve it from attack sothat re may use it when it i*. most willed.   Wo all know that inthe late war the tunnel would have helped immensely,,THE PRIMS MINISTER;^ we have had. a discussion upon thissubject and I was a member cf the Government the last time thisquestion came up for discussion in the Ecu go of Commons .* I ratherthink It&apos;was in 19C7. - when Sir Kei-.ry 0a.7.pleli Eann e a man. announ o-Cd the decision c-f the Government9   I way then I think at. theBoard cf Trade and I had to cc^so-der it. from the point of view oftrade and commercial facilities^   The Board of Trade was not thenvery - enthusiastic on tho cubje-ct.   They were net convir;\-ed that iiwould be a paying concern.   Personally I think that they werewrong there.   But the military advisers were againuc it. and then the Government by. a very considerable majority - and I rememberthe discussion - decided that we could., not fly. in the fade ofmilitary and naval opinion, and run tho, risk of establishingwhat&apos;might be a means of aceos3 to this country on the part of, agroat hostile European army.
The war has altered our views on many quest ions - and ncdouht it has taught us a great deal about this.   Let me sayjfirtrt^of all how the war is affecting our judgment.   We harearrivedat no final conclusion - I will tell you by and by what we havedecided to dc - \ut there is no doubt that it has modified very considerably the general attitude of Ministers towards the project,   Ministers when discussing it who, on looking at all thorecords of the past, are found, to have had a roctod hostility tothe whole enterprise, have now changed their general attitude,and are prepared to support this scheme, subject to a further examination by our military and naval advisers.There is no doubt that during the war it would hare made avery considerable difference to us if we had had that ChannelTunnel.   There were always the anxieties of getting our men andour material across the Channel,   fortunately o&apos;&quot;&quot;ing to the greaiprocautionsi which -ere taken and owing to the extraordinaryefficiency of our s^manship th re wer-- not v^ry many.accidents.There wore a few, but not many - probably not many more than womight have had in a tunnel running under enormous pressure.    Itis amazing haw small th;&apos; percentag- *f the losses was, when, weconsider that we- carried backwards and forwards probably four or five million troops across, the Channel.    It &apos;&quot;ras a very gratifyingachievement, and a great feat of seamanship.But still there were constant difficulties.   We found.itdifficult to send more than a certain number of men at a givenmoment.     I remember perfectly well the terrible days thatfollowed the 22nd March 191&amp; when we had to pour men across theChannel at a very great rat&apos;--, and also material.   It ^ould havemade a great difference to ua then if we had he d the ChannelTunnel at that tire.   We could havr run a constant stream oftrains without having to embark and disembark, lead and discharge,and to undergo all the trouble on the other side cf the Channel,and you might even have carried your material further inland.,which also would have boon a gr^at advantage.
I rise- remember, another peri d when it wps not quite certain whether our lines would hold, and we had to consider what might happen if wo had to Jail. back.     Then cap-&apos;e the terrible questionhow wit possible to get our material and our men away.    Allthat, would have been simplified enormously if we had had a rail-wsy behlnfl us.     Of course there has always been the difficultyof embarking men and material. ,    I do not say that it wouldhave been easy if we had had a railway, but it would have beeninfinitely-&apos;easier.    So from the point of view of our experience in this war there is no doubt in our minds that it would havemade bxx enormous difference, and a difference that would have .been entirely to the advantage of this country.There is one consideration of course In connection with thewar which will be against It.     That is what might have happenedat the beginning.   SSxore t&amp; m aocbl&apos; &apos;%B&amp;J, eucly la %h&amp;-  a? theGermans could have seized both Calais and goulogne if they had made a dash for it.    They did not think it worth while, whichwas one of their great oardinal blunders.   Certainly they wouldhave done it had there been a Channel Tunnel,    On the other hand the French would not have abandoned the ports on those conditions and we would have altered our strategy and the arrangements ofour forces to the extent at any rate of defending the bridgeheaduntil we were clear, and then If the Germans were there we could have destroyed it, and the sea would have been always open to us for taking our troops across.All those considerations arc considerations which on the wholetell in favour of the construction of the Channel Tunnel, and ac-count for the change in the attitude of Ministers, and a verygreat change in the tone of the discussion when we had it with-in the last few days, in anticipation of this deputation arid part-particularly as compared with the discussion ef which I have a&quot;
recollection In the year 1907, when the military- nd rumil..advija-tfrx,.were against It.What we have decided todo is this.    We should like to ex-a mine a little more carefully, we should like our military and naval advisers to examine a&apos; little more definitely, what are the dangers of a surprise attack.    We must not take risk3, and Ithink that all the members of the deputation will agree that ifthere is real risk of an enemy oapturing the bridgehead and con-converting this country from an island into merely a sort of partof the continent of Europe, which it would be If they had seizedthe railway that is a thing which we could not for a moment faoe.It would alter the whole character and complexion of things andwould weaken this country enormously.An essential part of our strength is due to the fact thatthis country is not as vulnerable as other countries are.    Anenemy cannot get at it.     That Is a source pf great strength tous, and our neighbours envy our isolation and the protection ofthe twenty six, miles of water that separate us from the continent.We do not want to give, it away.   We simply propose that the prob-lem shall again be examined very carefully from the militaryengineering point of view, and the naval and air point of view, andwe shall then be in a position to give a definite answer.     If themilitary advice is favourable the Ministry will certainly be pre-pared to support the scheme on general grounds.. - If it is.the reverse we certainly could not accept the responsibility,it would be far too great a responsibility to t*ke.The introducer of the deputation referred to the League ofNations.    I am a believer in the League of Nations, but I should like to see It working first before we put our whole trust in it.It is nr.t because I am suspicious of it or distrustful of it.     It
is not because 1 do n^t think thai- - It - engirt - W-* sac vxwul^It is not because I do not think that it -ill succeed,but the risk is too profit i:Vr us to put the -hole of theexistence of this country and may be the honour of thiscountry to the hazard of &apos; h-t is a great experiment.and ft noble experiment, but after all an experimentsThe &apos; orld is not promising at the present moment *   Thereare national passions nbich are still stirring up Europe*All that bids us to be careful, to be cautious, not to bein the least less enthusiastic for it, but it bids us at anyrate to remember that we are now an island *   Providencehas made us an island-I think for a great purpose in thehistory of Europe and of the worlds   The fact that it is an island has been the means of saving the liberty of Europemany a time.:   I do not rant it to cease to be an island;and I rant to be quite sure before I commit myself-and 1think my colleagues take the same view-that our action willnot deprive this country cf its providential advantage in that respectFe have no right to throw it away andany government that &quot;ouud do so without the most carefuland anxious consideration would not be discharging its duty..Apart from that, if we are reassured under thathead.,-; there is everything to be said for the Channel Tunnel..It strikes the imagination,    It opens up the road rightthrough&apos;:to&apos;t he east *   It facilitates intercourse with curnext doer neighbour T:&apos;iih rh&quot;;m re ha*-e linked our fortunes.and should there ever be any trouble for them or f-r- usv-:&amp; can help&apos; them and they can help us much more readilyowing to the fact of there being toe Channel Tunnel *Scientific developments may make one sea even much moreperilous than to his be-n;   it was perilous enough in allconscience during the last war.   It mov be tnat it &quot;illbecome almost impassable for us, and tints tunnel may beguarantee against any such development.    Those are thingso:&apos;hlch 1 e --ant to examine,   I am sure that you -ill notblame us before we commit /
ournolvoe. to sohothing which io a groat dopnrturo if v/o tnko allprecautions to bo vory cn.ro ful and to act wisely. That is nil Ihrvc got to cay,,SIR A FELL - -I do Tio^-know^^hoi^o^^yo-a would vfioh to hoaranything from any of tho soldiers who are prosont?THE PRIME MINISTER - I think thot thoy had &quot;bcttoi^comm-^ni-.cr.to with our military advisors if they have any views or mcmcr-nndn on the point,     I do not jrrnt thorn to bo influenced in their advice to our people $ but anything that may bo urged that must bocxrminod as really materialy if it Is military opinion; it isdesirable to send in.     Thoy might send it in to Sir MauriceHankoy, tho Secretary to the CabinetsSIR A FELL - Tio cannot find any soldiers to come forward andexpress an opinion against it0THE PRIME MINISTER&apos; - I am not suggesting that tho soldierswho arc advising us arc ogninst itj but I do not know that thoyhave sat down to examine it yot.   They have had so much to do,But I hopo that they shell bo able to do it in a short tino, andthem wo shell bo able to communicate to you* ,MR.RICHARDSON - Is it intended to form a. Committee to examineit from tho military point of view?THE PRIME MINISTER - No.&quot;    You must loavo that in tho firstinstance to the military staff and tho naval staff and also theair staff,   Thoy will have to advise us.    .Thoy will probably moottogether afterwards.   All those things will bo examined carefullyand th m -;o can communicate to you afterwards.     Tho difficulty  *is not a political one   It Is purely a military and naval oneSIR A FELL. - I thought thnt you. had had this enquired intoalrordy by the military authorities and. that they could have for^od an opinion before now.     It is vory distressing nr.ving tobo put off again as wo hrvo boon oh so1 many occasions^

There is now a very different condition of things * I a;:ree,   I am net goingto enter into the question^^raised by I&apos;Ir.AdE..iison,   I think onthe whole I would rather that somebody else should construct it.SIR A.
