7Political Intelligence De-oartment,FOREIGN OFFICE,ConfidentialCzeeho-Slovakia /00l.ber, 1919.UNREST IN SLOVAKIAyA^k^jf^e situation in Slovakia presents some disquietingfeatures, indicating a state of things with which the Government9f the Ozecho-Slovak Republic appears unable to co&quot;oe and whichmight conceivably lead to disaster.The economic situation in the Province seems to be verybade     From the accounts given by the British Czecho-Slovak Re-lief Mission a lack of food exists almost amount-in? to famine.Grass is used as a vegetable while bread is made of straw, Branand wood.     In one village 50;;:u of the children were found to betuberculous owing to malnutrition.     In rhe Turzovka districtthere was only one doctor for the 50,000 inhabitants.     Theprice of clothing was 1,000;&apos; higher than pre-war rates, and food 600;.i Nearer.The dissatisfaction arising from such hardships and the apparent apathy of the Central Government in relieving themnaturally plays into the hands of persons agitating for poli-ticalReasons against the existing regime.     Mr. Gosling re-ported on October 16th that the general situation and the atti-tud.e of Hlinka fa clerical autonomous agitator) who has a strongfollowing, was leading to a highly dangerous state of affairs,The Czech press attributed, the trouble to Polish machinations,a view which was su-^crted by the utterances of the Polish news-papors and by Hlinka&apos;s visit to Poland.Again, on October 20th Mr, Gosling reported that the ar-rest of Hlinka by the C zee ho-Slovak Government had led to, riot-ing in Slovakia, in the course of which hostilu demonstrations/ had
had &quot;been made against French, officers there.    !i&apos;he Government had decided to invoke the assistance of Dr. ICor&amp;aot the recently appointedArchbishop of Prague, who had agreed to do his best to calm the storm.An apparently reliable report, after noting the disappointmentof the citizens of the Republic &quot;in general that the new government must still levy heavy taxes, cannot &quot;produce fo*?d and raw material insufficient quantities, and is intact as power leas as the former Govern-ment to&apos;&quot;&quot;eliminate the inevitable aons saliences of the &apos;7ar, goes on tosay that &quot;Slovakia is t.&apos;.&apos;e. chief centre of unrest and trouble.    lot&apos; only does there .exist, a great and deep dislike of the Czechs in con-sequence both of the behaviour of the latter&apos;s troops towards thenativeoy/opulation;1 which in recent fight ing was far worse- than thatof the Hungarians, and in. view of the economic treatment accorded them. by the Czechs Government;   but there is also - extremely active, ertew.iiveand able propaganda being carried out by the Poles and. T-Jun^;arians witha view to effecting the disunion of Slovakia from the Czechs..     Torthis purpose the Poles and Hungarians are --forking hand in hand.     Atpresent there is no evidence to show that any agreement exists between-the Poles and Hungarians as to their future plans in regard to Slovakia.A further-factor contributing towards the general unrest is the antone-mist party led by father Flinka who was recently arrested.     his partyhowever y of itself would not be sufficiently strong: to be a danger&quot;,And further on, &quot;Considerable-pressure appears to have been broughttto bear recently on the Government in regard, to the condition of affairs in Slovakia.    5b e Cabinet have had to give serious attention to thematter and have come -to the conclusion that it is essential to delegateav strong and -trusted man&apos;to endeavour to win confidence in and symapathy for the Republic,      It would seem however, that it would now bean extremely difficult task to influence satisfactorily Slovak opinion&quot;f
Ther*is no doubt that the Poles, whether in orfer to bring&quot;pressure ta bear -over questions pending between them and Czecho-Slovakiaor from ulterior designs on the Slovak population, are at least givingpublicity to&apos; Slovak discontent, if they do not encourage it,     Thus,the Polish. Info mat ion Committee- in London supplies thy &quot;&apos;7est misterGazette&quot;&apos; ox September 18th with the following newsj said to be taken from;a Polish journal:   &quot;After a short stay in Warsaw? i he SlovakDe.le3at.ioi1 has left for. Paris in. order to acqua&amp;nt the Supreme council with the desperate position of the Slovaks under the rule of the Czechs.They will present te the Council of Four documents which will prove&apos;.the: b:.;e;;v2h of &apos;f-ai*fo committed by the Czechs, especially MM. Massarykand EeneSo- . -&apos; - - - -&quot;At t&apos;W Cbnferenbe of the Slovak and Czech leaders in America,Massaryk and Benes signed an agreement in whi^h they,.undertook .tosecure for-Slovakia complete independence within the-flzech State.    I6w,when M. Massaryk has become President of the Czech Republic and M. -Ben0s &quot;ttfi Foreign&apos;Minister, they consider the document which the si then jointlysigner- &apos;a scrap *of paper &quot;V &apos;&quot;The Slovak Delegation which represent this state of affairs at .Paris and. declare in the name of the SSiovak Nation that they have com-&quot;pleiely lost confidence in the Czechs, at the same time asking for aseparation from the Czech State&quot;.There seems a certain natural incompatibility between the Czechand Slovak characters.     The Czech is highly intelligent, as a rulewell educated, sceptical, and not over-scrupulous.    The typical Slovakis dull and ignorant peasant, and a devout churchman, shocker by the anti-clericalism of the Czech and averse to his methods of administration.,But it was obviously to the interest of the Republican Government to do
all in its power to please and Conciliate an element whicl? after all is-of Mncree rade, in view of the fact that there already exists inSSlovakian import-ant minority of Magyars who cannot but lie hostile to the Czechsand attracted to their oftn Itin in Hungary.
