This Document Is the property of His Britannic Hajesty!8 Government.t,P.177 UNEMPLOYMENT. INSURANCE,tecret. (J(NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR).The following notes on the Unemployment Benefit bill now before Parliament are circulated for the information ofmy colleagues.(Signed)   R.SJI0RNE.2.IS 919 sUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,le        Owing to the cessation of Out of Work Donation for civilians, a considerable number of unemployed workpeople will fall back upon the unemployment benefit to which they areentitled under the Unemployment Insurance Acts9   The weeklyrate of benefit under these Acts is, however, only 7/- a weekan amount which Is not likely to have much effect In allayingthe discontent which has been excited amongst the unemployedby the cessation of the Unemployment Donation,2.        The decision to stop civilian donation throws upon theGovernment an Increased responsibility for taking measures toensure that unavoidable distress among civilians Is relievedduring the coming winter, and this would be greatly lightenedIf the unemployed workpeople who are insured against unemployment,and who will form a considerable proportion of the total numberunemployed, could be provided with a more adequate rate ofbenefit than 7/- a week.   If this could be done these workpeoplei    could be treated as provided for, so far as the responsibilityof the State is concerned, and the field in which special measures would be necessary would be correspondingly narrowed^
O)       It happens that the rate of &quot;benefit under the UnemploymentInsurance Acts could be raised at once to 11/- a week withoutentailing any additional cost to the State, and even withouttrenching upon the surplus accumulated funds under these Act8*This arises because, owing to tho scanty data then available, theaverage rate of unemployment which was assumed w-:en the ratio of contributions to benefit was fixed was much too high.   Theworking of the Acts had provided much fuller and better data thanwere previously available, and on tho basis of these data theGovernment Actuary advises that a rate of benefit of 11/- a weekcan, as already stated, by paid - ithout. trenching upon thesurplus accumulated funds.   In other words, the contributionstogether with the future interest from the surplus accumulatedfunds are sufficient to enable benefit at 11/- a week to be paid;4.        In these circumstances it seems clear that steps oughtto be taken to raise the benefit to 11/- with the least possible delay.   It should perhaps be explained that the rate ofbenefit for men and women has to be identical because their contributions are identical and the Acts do not differentiate between them.     It would probably be possible to haveincreased the benefit to 11/.- by Administrative Order, but theftit rould be necessary to. go through the dilatory procedure of al\3pecial Order&quot; which entails, first of all, three weeks1 noticeof the proposals, to be followed by a public enquiry if objectionsare made.   Such delay would be most injurious, and it was there-fore arranged that the benefit should be increased to 11/- bymeans of a short Act.   This method of procedure has theincidental advantage of enabling a few consequential amendments to be made, which are necessary to bring the increased benefitinto line r:ith certain other provisions.
