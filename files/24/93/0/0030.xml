potency in promoting industrial stability andharmony.   When wide tracts of the working popula-tion have their wages regulated by statutoryOrder on an agreed and rational basis, the naturalresult is a steadying of the labour position as a.whole. Decisions of the Trade Boards are oftenaccepted by both sides with a bettor grace thanthose of arbitration tribunals because of the element of agreement.i&apos;C) The particular reason for urgency is the imminence.of the appointment of the Commission foreshadowed!in the Minimum Wages Commission Bill to inquire into minimum rates of wages.   I have not concealedfrom the Cabinet the difficulties which the existingBill presents, drafted as it was on the basis of compromise. It is in my view vital that the Commis-sion should be presented with the widest possibleachievement - either actual or immediately in prospect - in the field of adapting wages on areasonable basis to the circumstances of eachtrade. It is only by convincing the commission that Trade Boards have found, and are finding, afair solution of this problem on lines which ade-adequately reward labour without endangering trade,that the risk can be avoided of a flat minimum wage having no relation to the ability of tradeto bear the increase thus forced upon it. A flatminimum, fixed without regard to what tradescould boar, might seriously cripple importantsections of Industry, or alternatively might in-&apos;volve the State In demands, difficult to resist,for subsidies in, supoort of uneconomic wages.
(S) For those reasons I fool no doubt that we must proceed,and proceed rapidly, with the formation of Trade Boards on a scale not hitherto contemplated as possible. I am, however,compelled to come to the Cabinet for authority, becauseextension on this scale is not possible without a considerable expenditure on staff *The work involved is both complex and exacting.   it involves minute investigation of the limits of the tradeimmediately in question, and often of a score of others. it involves settlement of tho definition of the Trade, a matterof equal difficulty and importance,   It involves finally thetask of collecting the workers&apos; side of the Trade Board,which in t -e unorganised trades often means a personal so-lection of individual workmen in various parts of the country,after   the fullest enquiry.(4) I aim at completing the bulk of this work in a year: andfor this purpose   I shall need a temporary staff which Iestimate to cost about  20,000.   I recognise that the amountasked for is not inconsiderable.   It is trifling, however, ifcompared with the expense to the country that might be caused by an injudicious decision by the Minimum WagesCommission, unsupported by the evidence obtainable as a resultof these further enquiries; and it is small in comparisonwith the very considerable and growing economies which I havealready been able to report in the expenditure on staff inthe Department as a whole.(5) -I would therefore press very strongly for the Cabinet&apos;approval of the policy which I have outlined above.(Signed)   R. S. HORNE. *15th November,1919.
