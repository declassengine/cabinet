This document is the Property of.His Britannic Majesty&apos;s -GovernmentXDIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE(Home Office)Special Report on the&quot;Daily Herald(Circulated by the Home Secretary)SCOTLAND HOUSE, S.W.1
Directorate of IntelligenceSPECIAL  BEPOBT-No. 12The Daily Herald&quot;The policy of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has always been to encouragestrikes in vital industries, to applaud revolutionary movements, tofoment unrest among the troops, and persistently to misrepresentthe motives of the Government. On March 13th, 1919, it published a stolen confidential Home Forces circular and there was evidenceat that time that it was offering inducements to persons employedin the War Office to steal other documents. The Secretary ofState for War caused it to be struck off the list of papers circulatedto the troops. The question of prosecution has been considered on more than one occasion, but no action has been taken, andlatterly the paper has been more cautious in its editorials.THE   STAFF.The business of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is conducted at 2, GoughSquare, and the Editorial Department is in Tudor Street. Thepermanent Editorial Staff consists of Mr. George Lansbury, the editor, who is assisted by his married daughter Daisy, a niecenamed Bessie and another daughter (unmarried) who acts asassistant to Mr. Gerald Gould. Mr. Gerald Gould was acting as Foreign Editor a few months ago and probably still occupiesthat position ; he is helped by his wife, and probably the twoGoulds supply most of the acrimony which characterises thepaper. Mr. W. N. Ewer, who is now acting as New York Corres-correspondent, was previously in the Editorial Office ; he was formerlyprivate secretary to Baron De Forest and he may have inducedhis former employer to subscribe to the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; As aConscientious Objector his Avar experience was unfortunate ; he undertook work of national importance on-the land, where he
failed to get on terms with the dumb animals under his charge heis reported to have been tossed by a bull and bitten by a pedigreepig. Mr. Francis Meredith Meynell, who has just returned from Esthonia and Finland, is also on the staff ; he is a pushing,rather good-looking young man, and at a time when tho &quot; Herald &quot;was making strong appeals for financial help he gave two ratherexpensive dances to his friends in Copenhagen. He also invitedhis English colleagues to champagne supper parties when cham-pagne cost  3 a bottle. The sources of MeynelTs lavish cnter-tainments were much commented upon among his colleagues, whoknew that his means were limited. Captain Siegfried Sassoon,M.C., is responsible for the Reviews, but probably he is only anoccasional contributor ; it will be remembered that while a corn-missioned officer he protested, in a circular sent out in July, 1017,by the &quot; No Conscription Fellowship,&quot; against the continuedsacrifice of fighting men in the war by politicians.H. T. Maodonald, of 10, The Grove, Wands worth, Avas themoving spirit in the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen.&apos;s Union, ofwhich he was at one time President.. He served for some time in the8th Battalion London Regiment and then worked in the War Officefrom February, 1017, to November, 1917 ; he joined the staff ofthe &quot; Daily Herald &quot; in April, 1919, having been a contributor forsome time. He is the connecting link between the &quot; daily herald&quot; and the Sailors&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Union, whichowed its inception to the paper&apos;s attitude during what it described as &quot; The Great Mutiny &quot; at Folkestone. His house was raided, inMay, 1919, but no papers inciting soldiers to mutiny were found.;there was reliable information at the time that he had madeimproper use of War Office papers while employed there. He isnow believed to be in charge of the &quot; Ex-Service Men&apos;s Notes.&quot;column. Miss Bridges is the &quot; Aunt Kitsie &quot; of the Children&apos;sCorner. Mr. Vivian Brodsky is a Reporter ; he is an AustralianJew who saw active service in the 37th Battalion. AustralianInfantry. His father is a Jew, resident in New York. while serving in France Brodsky does not appear to have expressedextreme views, but he is now a violent extremist and unscrupulousin his methods of obtaining news. Harrop and Plujvimer alsowork in the Editorial Office and a man called Le Good is known asthe &quot; Night Publisher.&quot;Among the Foreign Correspondents are Grifein Barry, an american, in Reval, who furnishes news to the disparagement ofDenikin, Koltchak and Udenitch ; Mr. Morgan Phillips Price,a J.P. for Gloucestershire, who is the Berlin Correspondent, heseems lately to have married a German woman of humble origin ;Mr. J. F. Ankersmit, of &quot; Het Volk,&quot; Amsterdam ; and Mr. G.Sinicco, an Italian who is in touch with an extreme Italian, papercalled &quot; Lavoratore.&quot; It does not follow that a person who is described as &quot; Our Special Correspondent&quot; is really so : forexample, a Belgian named Moulin, who was so described, statedthat he met the representative of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; casually ina public house bar and that his articles on Russia had been distortedand in some cases forged by Mr. Norman Angell.Most of the Socialist writers in this country are occasionalcontributors to the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and. Mr. John Sctjrr,
Mr. Robert Dell, Mr. G. D. Cole, Mr. W. L. George, Mrs. AnnieBesant and Mr. Norman Angell are more or less regular con-distributors.The Business Manager is Mr. W. H. Hareord, whose confidentialsecretary is Miss Thomas. She is believed to receive a salary offrom  5 to  6 a week. When she was acting as a teacher at theClapton Secondary School in August, 1918, she was stronglypacifist. The Office Manager is Mr. Teignmouth Shore. HisTypist is a Miss Ostrowsky. All the Typists receive a minimum of  3 10s. a week. The Circulation Manager is Mr. G. Beasley,an uneducated man, not a keen Socialist, who appears to be influenced chiefly by a desire to retain his job. The Advertise-ment Department is conducted by Mr. John Goss, who belonged to Raskin College, and who is very intimate with Mr. H. R.Barbor, of 54, Chancery Lane, the Assistant Editor of the&quot; Actor.&quot; Goss and Barbor are both extremely advanced in theirviews and Barbor is engaged on a book on the Coming Revolutionin England. The Advertisement touts are Drinkwater, who isalso an extremist, Day, Lazenby and Roberts. The LondonTravellers are the brothers Leonard and Percy Howard ; bothare extremists and Leonard was a conscientious objector. AMr. Clark, an advanced Socialist, is employed in the Packer&apos;department, and another man, named Deserne, spends most ofhis time in the cellars, where he is supposed to be looking afterphotographs. The Accountant at the London Office is W. H.Taylor.The local Agents, known as Travellers, are as follows : W. W. Stephenson, 37, North Bridge Road, Sunderland.J. C. Oulson, 34, Major Road, Canton, Cardiff.----Macgill, 26, Apslcy Place, GlasgoAv.T. J. Richards, Victoria Park, Gotham, Bristol.E. W. Rumbol, Arnold&apos;s Point, Laira, Plymouth.H. A.

Burr, 3, Gough Street, Cardiff.All these travellers are responsible for local sales and. attend&quot; Herald &quot; and other Labour meetings, where they give awaycopies of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; gratis.   They keep in close touchwith the London Office by letter and occasionally report personally.SOURCES   OF   CAPITAL.It is common gossip in both the Business and Editorial depart-ments that at least one millionaire is backing the &quot; Herald.&quot;The persons who know about this are Harford and his confidentialsecretary.&quot; The Daily Herald&quot; grew out of the weekly &quot; Herald.&quot;which was registered under the Companies Act, 1908, at SomersetHouse oii the 23rd June, 1913, with a nominal capital of  2,000,divided into 40,000 shares of Is. each.It is printed and published by the &quot; Victoria House PrintingCo., Ltd.,&quot; Tudor Street, E.C., for the Proprietors, &quot; The LimitPrinting and Publishing Co., Ltd.,&quot; 2, Carmelite Street, E.C., and2, Go ugh Square.

The &quot; Limit &quot; Printing &amp; Publishing Co., Ltd., was regis-tered at Somerset House on 23rd June, 1913, with a nominal capital of  2,000 divided into 40,000 shares of Is. each. Bankers, London&amp; South Western Bank, Ltd., Fleet Street Branch. The returndated 5th November, 1919, gives the following : Directors.George Lansbury, Timber Merchant, 39, Bow Road, E.Robert Williams, Trade Union Secretary, Ilex Cottage,Ashtead.Francis Meynell, Assistant Editor, 67, Romney Street,S.W.Shareholders.George Lansbury      ...............3S20Charles Lapworth, no address, journalist......   1020Robert Williams, 8, St. Martin&apos;s Place, S.W.      ...    200Francis Meynell      ...............   1000Sime S. Williams, married woman, Ilex Cottage,   2000AshteadHilda Saxe, married woman, 07, Romney Street  ...   2000Secretary to the Company F. R. Swan.In his latest appeal for funds Mr. Lansbury gives the &quot; Herald &quot;capital at  125,000, but, according to the figures set out above, the combined capital of the &quot; Victoria &quot; and &quot; Limit &quot; Printing &amp; Pub-lishing Companies is only  28,505.Great mystery is preserved about the sources of the capital andthe blanks can only be filled in partly from inference and partly from the remarks of persons who are in Mr. Lansbury&apos;s confidence.It is believed that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; obtained its initial capitalfrom Mr. Harben, one of the financial supporters of the Suffragettemovement; Miss Dodge, a wealthy American lady who also finan-ced the Suffragettes and who now, owing to her age and state ofhealth, allows herself to be exploited by the promoters of anyadvanced movement; and the Indian Nationalists. It is prac-tically certain that Mr. Harben and Miss Dodge did subscribecertain sums of money, but as regards the Indian Nationalists somecurious facts have to be taken into account. Among the shares ofthe Victoria House Printing Company when first allotted there areno less than seven amounts of  6,248 and of these Mrs. AnnieBesant and C. Jinarajadasa received allotments of 6,248 sharesfully paid up. Now  6,248 is approximately a lakh of rupees. Thereare persistent reports that Mr. Bomanji, a director of the &quot; BombayChronicle,&quot; gave a lakh of rupees to the Home Rule Movement :he was introduced by the President at the meeting at Delhi on the27th April, 1918, as the person who had done so. It was furtherreported, that as Bomanji was not in the position to give so much money, that there was someone behind him and that that personwas the Gaekwar of Baroda. The Gaekwar is believed to havedenied this, but the reports are persistent and some weight must beattached: to them. When Mr. Lansbury began his campaign for raising the circulation of his paper, the &quot;Morning Post&quot; called attention to the shares held by Mrs. Besant and elicited from herthe statement that she &quot; knew nothing about the matter &quot; until herfriends presented her with a gift of 6,248   1 shares.   In the issue of
October lltli Mr. Lansbury disclaimed having received a pennyfrom any &quot; German baron &quot; (? Baron von Horst) or &quot; Americanmillionaire &quot; (? John de Kay), but said, nothing at all about &quot; Indianagitators.&quot; However this may be, it seems certain that gifts oftwo lakhs of rupees have been made and that the shares have been allotted to Mrs. Besant and C. Jinarajadasa. According to the pre-sent Somerset House returns there has been an extensive redistribution-bution of shares among the shareholders : the holdings of Mrs.Annie Besant and Jinabajadasa have been cut down by half,while the holdings of the others have also been halved, but havebeen paid for, which was not the case at the time of the allot-ment in other words, the gratuitous fully paid shares of Mrs.Besant and Jinarajadasa have been distributed among the others,so that there need be no calls upon them.There have been subsidiary subscriptions. In September last,during the campaign for additional funds, there was a bank over-draft of  2,000, which Mr. Lansbury hoped to pay off by draftsfrom Berne, and just at this time John de Kay, the internationalAmerican socialist who falsely poses as a millionaire, did sell Mexi-can Bonds to the amount of  2,000 in order to pay a draft due onthe 23rd September. He is believed to have promised Mr. Lans-bury  150,000 for the support of the &quot; Herald League,&quot; but, fromremarks made by Meynell when on his Banish trip, it appears thatthis fell through because de Kay stipulated that the paper should publish large instalments of his book on Socialism, for which,Meynell said, they had no room. This must have been a relief tode Kay, who could not possibly have raised  150,000 then or atany other time.From intercepted correspondence it is certain that Mr. PhilipsPrice, who acts as Foreign Correspondent in Berlin, gave  5,000and that his brother has suggested an additional gift of  10,000.In the spring of this year Tilak was reported to have subscribed 5,000. When Mr. Meynell went to Copenhagen Mr. Lansburywas seriously considering the sale of the control of his paper, but onthe 18th September his views suddenly changed : he stated that hehad received a private subsidy which made him independent of profits. It is significant that this announcement coincided with thereturn of Mr. Meynell from Scandinavia, for during his trip toCopenhagen he left the other journalists and twice went off onmysterious errands alone ; he was supposed to be buying paper in sweden and it is believed that during his stay in Stockholm he got into communication with Strom, the Swedish extreme Socialist,who is in touch with the Russian Bolsheviks and who was formerlya German agent ; this is the same man who gave money to theyoung Norwegian Zachariassen, who brought money over to MissSylvia Pankhurst.FINANCIAL   POSITION.The financial position of the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is not satisfactory.At the beginning of September it was estimated that the Advertise-ment Receipts amounted to less than  90 a week, Avhile the bill forPrinting and Paper was  60 a day ; the outgoings were abouu 2,100 and the Sales even supposing that no copies were given
gratis were about  1,200 a week ; the paper was believed to belosing about  800 a week. Mr. Lansbury has always expressed a sovereign contempt for advertisements, which are to his mind oneof the evils of the capitalistic system. Competent journalistsbelieve that if the management were in capable hands it might bemade to pay. When Mr. Lansbury was contemplating the sale inAugust last, a question was put to Mr. Appleton whether it wouldnot be worth while for responsible Labour leaders to purchase thepaper, appoint really competent business managers and run it ata profit; he appeared to be dubious and said that no Labour dailycould be made to pay but in this matter good journalists do not agree. It will be remembered that Mr, Lansbury&apos;s commercialventures for many years have been uniformly unfortunate : he doesnot appear to have any business instinct and for this reason hissentimental appeals to the working class, alluring as they are, donot seem likely to put the paper on a permanent financial basis.The railway strike was a great opportunity for increasing the sales,because Mr. Foot (Secretary of the N.U.R.) became virtually a toutfor the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; and the meetings for &quot; Hands Off Russia &quot;at the Albert Hall and elsewhere struck even the most ardentsupporters of non-intervention as being merely a touting devicefor increasing the circulation of the paper. Mr. Lansbury is nowappealing for  400,000 to improve the printing plant and to carryon a Manchester edition. He claims that the daily circulation&apos;isalready 320,000 and gives the capital at  125,000. No doubt the circulation figures include copies given away gratuitously and it isto be remembered that the circulation continued to be lowuntil Mr. Lansbury was reluctantly induced to run a SportingColumn, in which he was lucky enough to spot five winners in one day.Mr. Lansbury, writing on &quot; Our Future &quot; in the issue of Novem-ber 15th, said that in response to the appeal for funds there hadbeen &quot;  200,000 sunk by friends who are not Labour men andwomen in making our present splendid position. They are willing,by instalments, to put up another  100,000. All this is offered asa free gift to the Labour and Socialist movement.&quot;Trades Unions (ignoring the object-lesson given by the fate of the&quot; Daily Citizen,&quot; in which they lost  300,000) are giving the &quot; daily herald &quot; considerable financial as well as verbal support. TheFurnishing Trades Association propose to invest  2,000 and theLondon Branch of the Boot and Shoe Operatives  500. Totten-ham Branch of the National Union of Railwaymen has elected o&quot; Herald Development Secretary &quot; and agreed at a recent meeting that, as  4,000 was urgently needed, a collection should be made inthe Branch Room for four weeks. Cricklewood branch of theA.S.E. has requested the Executive to grant  20,000 to the fund ;East Greenwich branch has called for a national ballot of members on the question of making a &quot; substantial grant,&quot; expressing theview that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is &quot; worthy of all the financialassistance the A.S.E and other organisations can render to it&quot;;while Willesden No. 2 Branch of the Society has called on theExecutive to realise the whole of the War Loan Stock and place themoney at the disposal of Mr, Lansbury,B.H.T.
