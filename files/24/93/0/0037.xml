such a sum in addition to the amount&apos;provided in Clause 5inof the letter of 1st September, as would/the Minister&apos;opinion be necessary to make an adequate total allowance.An opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown hasbeen obtained on the meaning of this Clause, anc1 theyconsider that tho Minister will be obliged&apos;to pay someamount in addition to 55^ of the approved, final cost.   SeeAppendix Ba-Owing to labour and other difficulties the progressduring the war was not nearly so rapid as had been anticipated,but the commitments of the Company Were large ?:nd a great dealof raw material had been carted on to the site by the date ofthe Armistice.In October 1918, a Coneit/bee was appointed in theMinistry to consider &quot;financial points arising out of SteelV/orks Extension Schemes&quot; with Sir John Hunter as Chairman,and as a result it was not considered economical to close downthis scheme in view of the ter;^s ox the contract and. the largecommitments.After the date of the Armistice Sir John Huntercommunicated with the Company with a view to fixing theMinister5s maximum liability, but no satisfactory decision has yet been arrive-&quot; at.     I have therefore recentlya;.?)orated a ieohnical expert to consider the figures witha technical expert of the Apoleby Company.It has been ascertained that the expenditure at the then cost of labour and materials under the original scheme amounted to :-  1,9.13,7.00,
III. 1,91.3,700.Plus Interest allcvfed99., 000Increased cost cf improved llillaand larger &quot;bujJ.dlr.gs forthe same,whi.&apos;h veie part*f the approved cost:-324,321 2*337,021Over and above this amount, to which underthe agreement the Minister contributes 55$must be fcdded:-Aw&amp;r&amp;s on wages on the originalsoheme  631*521Awards tin wages 4n ImprovedMills arid larger/buildings 107*026Allowances for inoreasedclaims fer wages, shorter working hours and othercontingencies have been estimated at:- 741*486Additional Interest 138,000Making a total of -  1.618,033In addition the Company-olaim an alliance of afurther 45$ - (making 100$ in all) - on awards and interest,etc amounting to  1,516,033 under the clause in the letterOf the 21st September, making  728*115.The above figures have been based on the costs as estimated on the 1st January, 1919, since which date wagesand the ctsfc cf materials have risen and it is anticipatedthat should the scheme be allowed to proceed the totalliability of the Ministry would considerably exceed thesefigures.With a grand total of - 3,955,054To this grand total the ijinistermust contribute 55$ - Viz- 2,175,280
Every endeavour has been me.de by negotiation toreduce the company olaim in regard to the  728,115 and ultimately the Compfny has offered to accept one half of thatsum, being of the 45$ which they originally claimed.In all circumstances it is considered that it is inthe best interest of the State to cgree to such a settlement and definitely limit the Department&apos;s liability rather than thatthe scheme should proceed under the original agreement, moreparticularly, as elreedy stated, the figures on which thesettlement is based are those of januery 1919 and not those ofto-day,The total liability under the above proposed settlement would be  2,539,337.10.0, to be paid according tothe provisions of the original agreement.The Compeny have convinced the Ministry thatno object would be attained, nor any expense saved, in curtailingthe building operations, which cannot bo completed until towardsthe end of 1921, but which when completed, will form one of themost efficient steel works in the country.The matter is very urgent, as it has been underconsideration for a considerable period and the Company erenot prepared to keep the offer open.   I must therefore ask for cabinet authority to effect a settlement cn the lines indicated above at an early date.
