This Document is the Property of /?/His Britannic iVisfestys Government &apos;  A     IV ^1^rim^\   - i&quot;^T \   %0TE on the future of the Supreme Economic CouncillCg^B*^ French note raises questions as to the future of therSupreme Economic Council and Its relation to the League ofNations..The following observations may be of use in this consideration , The Supreme Economic council was set up in February last for the purpose of dealing with economic questions arising duringthe Armistice period and for considering generally any questionsof economic reconstruction.2, At practically the last meeting of the Council of Heads of states held In Paris on June 28th, just before the departure of president Wilson for America, the following resolution was moved by Mr. Lloyd   George and approved by the Council&quot;That In some form International consultation in economic matters should be continued until the Council of the League of Nationshas had an opportunity of consideringthe present acute position of the economicsituation, and that the Supreme economic council should be requested to suggestfor the consideration of the severalGovernments tho methods of consultationwhich would be most serviceable for this purpose&quot;,^        In accordance with this Resolution, a scheme was draftedfor setting up an International Economic Council which should,bebecome or/merged Into the economic side of the League of Nationswasmachinery and /submitted for approval to the Governments concerned.The scheme was approved by the British War Cabinet on the 4thJuly.   At a meeting of the Supreme Economic Council in Londonearly in August, which was. the last meeting attended by the americans, the formal notification of the approval of thevarious Governments was communicated to the Council, save in thecase of the American delegates who stated that they had not received a reply from their government   No reply hag ever beenreceived from the Americans but they have ceased to attend the meetings of the Council.In/
4.   In the meantime a further meeting of the Council was holdin Brussels in September, and another meeting takes place in Romethis week.   The various SuboComm.committees of the Council, particularly the Food Committee and the &quot;Communications Section, have held manymeetings.5. In a letter to the Chancellor, which has been.circulated,Sir John Bradbury urges that the&apos; Supreme Economic Council should now be dissolved mainly on the following grounds :-(i) That the Reparation Commission can act for the AlliedGovernments in determining under Clause 235 of the treaty the food and raw materials which enemy countries may have.(ii) That the Americans object to the Supreme   Economic Council.(ill) In any case its work is now unnecessary.But Sir John Bradbury apparently leaves the Consultative FoodCommittee and the Communications Section in doubtful existence in mid-air, or responsible, If to anybody, to the Reparation Commission,6. As to (i), the Supreme. Economic.Council has never in fact dealtwith, this work, though Sir John himself suggested to the ReparationCommission a few weeks ago that it should do It.   It would, In anyoa.se, form a very subordinate part of the work of the Council.   Theapecial Interest of the Council is to secure.that before decisions as to the   supply of food end materials to. Germany and Austria arctaken the effect on the Allied countries and the rest of europe should be considered.   As the Reparation Commission will not be/concerned with the supply of food stuffs, raw materials, etc.to Allied countries this Is an aepoct of the question on which ithas no spcoial competence.7.   As to (ii), the whole American attitude towards the Treaty andthe League of Nations is at the moment extremely disquieting. Butit
it would be disastrous from the European point of view as well as&apos;frotti that of the League  )f Nations, if Great Britain was to choosethis moment to v/itV.raw&apos; from the Supreme Economic Council.   unless it is decided that on account of&apos;the American attitude the League ofNations must he abandoned, surely the right course is to let the americans and the other European countries see that the UnitedKingdom at any rate will continue to stand with her Allies.To abandon the.machinery of economic co-operation now would have amost serious political, as well as economic, effect throughout europe which could not fail to affect British interests adversely.As to (iii)   the present state of Europe can clearly only be adjusted by international as distinct from..separate national action,which is a sufficient justification for the continuance of theSupreme Economic Council.     General shortage of certain essential foodstuffs; j: ( coal shortage everywhere;, cost of living continuing to rise;    a complete financial crash by no means improbable owiogto the breakdown of the Exchanges-   the whole Russian situationdependent on Allied agreement on economic as well as on politicalarepolicy;   all these/matters which can only be settled in concertbetween the&apos;Powers.Nothing has happened since June which diminishes the need of theinternational consultation in economic matters, which the Councilof Four agreed to be necessary.     Indeed, the delay in ratifying the Treaty, the increasing difficulties of Europe and the growingfeeling that the League of Nations will stand or fall by its handling of the, present economic situation, combine to render the continuanceof the machinery of consultation among the Allies   until the&apos;Leagueof Nations is ready to take up its responsibility, of vitalinternational importance.The disastrous results of the hiatus a year ago between the warorganisation of the Allies and the setting up of the Supreme economic council are still being felt, and it should be observed that thefatal
fatal delay of three months was due   solely to the unwillingnessof the American Government to accept the British, French andItalian proposals.10.    If tho Allies decide that the Treaty must stand and theLeague of Nations must bo started with or \ ithout tho Americansthen tho methods of working the League of Nations on the economicside would at once have to be considered.   The Supreme economic council should of course only continue until the Council or theAssembly of tho League of Nations is prepared to take over responsibility.On the assumption that with or without the Americans theTreaty will stand and the Council of the League of Nations willat once be formed, the following lines of policy are asuggestcdVii) A council or Commission should be set up under the authorityof the League for consultation and co-operation In economic matters.   It should be international in its compositionshould consist of Ministers., and should moot periodically,(ii) Its functions, composition and organisation should besettled by the Council of the League,   They wouldLAof course fm&quot;subject to revision at the first mooting oftho Assembly of the League,(iii) The Permanent Committee of the Supreme Economic council should assist the Secretariat of the League to draft ascheme for submission to tho Council of the League forthis new economic Commission.\iv) The Consultative Food Committee, the Communications Section.Tho Raw Materials and Statistical Committee should come under the authority of this international Commission tothe extent and in the manner to be settled by the poundl
5.of the League of Nations.     They should for the present continueto carry out t^eir present functions and also so far as theReparation Co.mission may dosire should assist the ReparationCommission.(v) The Supre le Econ v-nic Council should draw the urgent attentionof the Council of the League t.) the serious - danger      th.eEuropean economic situation and should urge that action on international lines embracing neutrals as well   s allies should&apos; be taheo immediately to deal &quot;&apos;ith questions of communications, currency   relief, etc.(vi) The Supreme Economic Council should fornally be dissolved atthe moment that the new Economic Commission und^r the Leagueof Nations comes into existence.E.
