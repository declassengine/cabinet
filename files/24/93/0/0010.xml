B I 1J FT,FUTURF OF TJIX&quot; 8UPRFMF ECONOMIC COUNCIL(firoj(&apos;. by.Jkf Ch snc clior of thFxchejjuj:   )-I circulate to the Cabinet a lfttrr from the. principalBritish Delegate on the Reparation Commission, and would be glad if the Cabinet would approve instructions being given that theSupreme Fconomio Council shall be brought to an end.(intd.)   A.C.Treasury, s;w; 12th November, 1919,?&apos;y dear chancellor ellar,.&quot;I sec that it is proposed to hold a Meeting of the S.?.C.in Rome towards the end of this month) and I take the opportunityof giviny you my personal opinion on the continued activities ofthis body.   I believe that there are no longer good reasons forits existence, and that it would be a good thing, if the Meetingat Rome couK be given the character of a funeral ceremony. ^So Ion,?; as it was uncertain whether we would maintain theviev that the Allied and Associated Governments, as distinct from the Rep ration commission, were responsible for the cxamina-tion and. approval of demands for the supply ^f Germany underArticle 235, there was much to be said for keeping the S.F.C. inin being on its supply side for the specific purpose of studying the needs of ex-enemy countries.   Hew that I have been in-structed to&apos; fall.in with the views of the other Allied Govern-merits on this question,  the most import -nt .sphere of utility forthe S.&quot;E.G. would seem to have disappeared,   More than that, itsactivity on such a question may be positively mischievous.   take as an instance the attached copy of,the Minute of the 4thMeeting of the permanent Committee.   The activity displayed inthis Minute woulc now be entirely misdirected energy*   The Per-manent committee constantly tends to assume an interest insubjects with which &quot;ether eo-ipetent bodies are directed to deal -a course which is bcunc to lead to overlapping and almost certainly to lead to friction.There is another very important aspect of the question,whioh should not be overlooked.   The Americans have long ocasedtc be represented on-, the Supreme Eoonordo Council, ana the- verymention of its name invariably acts as an irritant upon theOfficial representatives of the United States.   Any suspicion of interference may at-any moment cause a serious outbreak off eelin *.VJH I have thou ht it well to, imp;,rt my personal views to you,In oase you care to discuss the matter with the President of theBoard of Trace,   I should add that two Sections of the council are still doin? what is in my opinion useful work   - I refer tothe Relief and Communications Seotions. The Relief Seotion, how-ever, will soon be wounci up, and its present activity is confined
3P0almost exclusively to Vienna, wherY its work is closely oon-neoted with, and must almost inevitably merge in, th it of theReparation commission.   The communications Section may in due course become a Subcommittee of the Reparation Commission;this is a question, however, which I should prefer not to represent-judged, and for that reason there is a certain advantage in maintaining a Communications section in being for some timeto aomeiThere remains the question of the Consultative FoodCommittee,   This will no doubt have to 30 on as a JointCommittee of the Food Ministries of the various powers, and theReparation Commission will have to be represented on it in viewof our concern in the feeding of ex-enemy?&apos; countries, if theCommittee is tc deal with the co-ordination of demand as well asCf purchasing arrangements,, (which was, I believe, itsoriginal function).   Another, and perhaps better, plan wouldbf to restrict the tod-sting Committee to the co-ordination of purchase, and have a separate Committee to deal with all demands*in this case the Reparation commission need be representedonly on the latter, the ex-enemy Food Ministries being directlyrepresented on the former.But in either alternative, however, the S^-C, would bemerely a fifth wheel to the coach, and would serve no purposeexcept to interfere with the practical administration and toannoy the Americans J&apos;(Sgdc)    JOHN BRADBURY.- 2 -
