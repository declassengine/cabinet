Continuation of our 14-838. Aeroplanes for Meshed. If these are to beprovided by us, we can only spare B.E. t\pe of machines, and we do not consider thatthese are good enough for the task as they may expect opposition in the air. More-over, we are unable to spare any personnel without, impairing efficiency of force inIndia. To maintain one flight at Meshed we calculate the following will berequired :-Advanced air craft store at Duzdap with three months&apos; supply of stores,oil and petrol. Three months-&apos; supply of latter also at Meshed with flight, and inaddition supply of bombs.* To move flight from Duzdap, excluding petrol, oil, &quot;bombs and workshopmachinery, will require 68 Ford vans in first instalment, and to maintain it willrequire daily convoy of four Ford vans thereafter.If aeroplanes are to be sent, we consider the following to be the minimum requirements, and these must be supplied from elsewhere than from India. Oneflight of four service machines, Bristol fighter type, tender (? with) two-machines in reserve. Personnel, including (corrupt.group) (? private)s, section officers 11, other ranks (? 56). Workshop lorries and cordons. Presume Malleson could arrange forlatter.If you decide to arrange for supply of machines and personnel wre should likeearly notice to make preliminary arrangements.
