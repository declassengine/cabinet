Departmental.Some Aspects of the Year&apos;s Work ,The armistice brought with it a great expansion of the work and responsibility ofthe Ministry of Labour. It is only when that work is viewed over a-period ofsome length that it becomes possible to measure its results, and to give some guess at its value.   The completion of the first year from that date affords a convenient^0 1916)   255   11/19  h &amp; s *j j 
opportunity for a brief resume of some of the many aspects of the Ministry&apos;s activities.It is proposed here to deal with the group of questions which centre round employment.The Ministry of Labour was called upon to co-operate in demobilisation, and the resettlement of demobilised members of the three Forces, both men and women. its functions in the first of these directions were rendered in some ways less onerous by the alteration in the system of demobilisation which military exigencies rendered necessary, atthe beginning of February. The registration of men as pivotal for peace work came to an end, and the registration of definite offers of employment for men with the forces was also brought to a close. Even after February, however, this earlier work of theMinistry was of value in determining to some extent the priority assigned to those who fell within the new limits of demobilisation. By the end of January, a little over a millionofficers and men were demobilised from the three Forces, together with a small number-of members of the Women&apos;s Services. Since the beginning of February, these figures havebeen greatly exceeded, the number of officers and men demobilised up to the 30th Octoberhaving grown to over 3,700,000, and the total of demobilised members of the Women&apos;services exceeding 80,000 on the same date. The importance, however, ..of the workperformed by the Ministry of Labour during the earlier period should not be minimised.The alteration in the system of demobilisation became necessary on grounds other thanthose with which the Ministry was primarily concerned. The relegation of these considera-tions to a secondary place was followed at once by a growth in unemployment amongdemobilised members of the Forces, while the retention in the Army of men urgently needed for civil work produced difficulties which in several directions have not yet been overcome.The Ministry of Labour have thus been called upon mainly to assist through the agency-of the Employment Exchanges in the resettlement of over 3,500,000 men, exclusive ofofficers, and 80,000 members of the Women&apos;s Services. Through the AppointmentsDepartment, it was called upon during the earlier period of demobilisation to act as thechannel through which, in 170,000 cases, offers of employment were transmitted to officersand men of similar professional type still with the Forces and seeking demobilisation.When this work has brought to an end, the Appointments Department reverted exclusively to the activities for which it was originally designed, the provision of training for officers,and men of similar educational standing, whose careers had been interrupted by war service, and the establishment of -a system bringing together officers seeking employment and employers with work to offer. Simultaneously, the Employment Department was called upon to deal, again through the Employment Exchanges,, with the resettlement of&apos;war workers needing new employment whose number may be roughly estimated at,000,000.       :The Employment Exchanges were assisted in their work by the Local employment committees, and the recently dissolved Employment Councils, whose activities are knownto have smoothed out many minor difficulties which could best be settled locally, and tohave stimulated employers to the development of their peace programmes. The Exchangesfound themselves, late in April, with about a million and a quarter applicants for employ-ment on their books, of whom nearly 657,000 wore men. On the 24th October, though the registers had been swollen to some extent by the effects of the ironmoulders&apos; strike, thenumber stood only at approximately 500,000 of whom about 476,000 were men. Through-out the whole of the period following on the armistice, the Exchanges have placed a numberof applicants, which only in very exceptional circumstances has fallen below 20,000 a weekand which has frequently been nearer to 30,000. This great transfer from war activityto peace activity has been attended by very little of the trouble which was at one timeexpected to arise out of questions of dilution, and the restoration of pre-war practice. TheDepartment was also called upon during this period to administer through the exchanges and Local Employment Committees the out-of-work donation instituted by the Govern-ment to tide over the period of dislocation inevitable in so many industries. The amount paid under the scheme by the end of October was under  40,000,000. Despite the criticism which has been brought to bear upon the scheme and its administration, nopossible alternative has as yet been pointed out as to the course which, the Governmentadopted, and very little evidence has been brought forward that the administration of thescheme has not been conducted with all the care and strictness which was possible underthe circumstances.The special requirements of the ports in connection with the administration of the out-of-work donation afforded in many cases an opportunity for the institution of schemesfor the decasualisation of dock labour by registration and the formation of agreements for the employment, in normal circumstances, of registered labour only. This work hasbeen carried out in conjunction with the Port Labour Committees, and has necessitated the setting up of a number of these bodies in ports where they did not exist during the war.Decasualisation schemes are now working in the majority of the principal ports.
The Ministry was also entrusted with the work of repatriating, at the cost of theGovernment, alien workers who had been brought to this country, otherwise than at theirown expense, for work on Government contracts. Over 4,000 cases of this kind had tobe dealt with, Portuguese citizens accounting for two-thirds of the number. similar arrangements had to be carried out for the repatriation of British citizens from overseas,to whom a gratuity was granted as well as the expenses of repatriation ; and this work isstill not quite completed.In dealing with applications for training from, officers and men of equal educationalqualifications, the Appointments Department has acted as the common channel of approachfor all candidates, whether or not the training which they desired fell within the limits of professional and business training to which its own work was confined. Excludingcancellations and withdrawals, some 60,000 applications have passed through the hands ofthe Department, of which nearly 22,000 were for professional or business training. Themachinery of District Selective Committees and Interviewing Boards, and of CentralGrants Committee at headquarters, which was fully established by the beginning of May,has given the Department the voluntary assistance of professional and business men inthe selection of candidates, in the approval of the training vacancies secured for them,and in the assessment of awards. Over 8,000 training grants had been sanctioned bythe Central Grants Committee to date, of which 4,900 were for men of other ranks thanthat of commissioned officers. The training work of the Department in the importantfield of engineering has been hampered by difficulties with the trade unions, which have still to be overcome, but in general a more serious difficulty has been found in inadequatenumber of training vacancies placed at the disposal of the Department. An appeal bythe Minister, which is now being given full circulation by most of the important professionalsocieties to their members, should have a good effect. As regards appointments, theDepartment has placed candidates known to exceed 16,000 in number. There are stillon the books over 22,000 applicants, including 3,000 who have not served with the Forces,while only a little over 4,000 vacancies are at present available. The value of theDepartment as an information bureau for ex-officers cannot, of course, be representedstatistically, but must none the less be taken into serious account in any survey of theactivities of the Ministry. Special mention may also be made of the assistance which the appointments Department has been able to obtain for ex-officers by bringing them into touch with the voluntary societies organised for their benefit.Closely associated with the problems of employment have been those of industrial,training. The various sections of the Ministry dealing with this work-have been organisedsince the beginning of January in the Training Department. The Ministry has taken over from the Ministry of Pensions the responsibility for the industrial training of disabled soldiers other than that carried on for curative purposes. Progress in this direction wassummarised in this Report for the 22nd October, and may, therefore, be passed over with,only brief mention. Much progress has been made, but a good deal remains still to be done before accommodation for all men requiring training has been provided. It has beenfound necessary to avoid the appearance of haste in this matter in order to secure good prospects of employment when training is completed, for the unions have in many casesbeen cautious in the admission of disabled men in any large numbers to their industries.The steps which the Ministry has taken to save apprentices, whose training was interrupted by war service, from sinking into the position of semi-skilled or unskilled men have beenattended by considerable success. Negotiations for the recognition of schemes by employers and employed have been carried to a successful conclusion in 33 industries, aGeneral Scheme has been provided to cover apprentices engaged in industries for whicha separate scheme was considered unnecessary, and at the end of October over 16,000apprentices were in receipt of State aid to complete their training. The value of this work in a number of industries cannot even yet be fully estimated. Apprentices, beingmostly young men, were frequently protected from military service until a comparativelylate date, and their retention in the Army has been prolonged by a system of demobilisationwhich takes account primarily of age and length of service.The development of training schemes for unemployed women is only now assumingits full dimensions. A substantial number of women are now in training either for normalwomen&apos;s processes in industry, or for domestic work, and evidence as to those who have completed their training shows that the work has been a success. At the present time,when employers in a number of industries in certain parts of the country are reluctant to engage unskilled workers at the rates guaranteed under the Wages (Temporary Regulation)Act, the problem of women&apos;s training has assumed an aspect of corresponding importance.It remains to mention in connection with this problem of employment, that theMinistry became responsible in April for the administration of the Military Service (civil liabilities) Schemes, which have involved during 1919 the consideration of over 24.000(C 1916) 3 K 2
cases, in nearly .10,000 of which grants have been made to assist resettlement.The operation of the Retail Business (Licensing) Order, an order made mainly for theprotection of the serving soldier, has also rested since March, 1919, in the hands of theMinistry. Mention may finally be made of the recent provision of improved machinery to deal with questions arising out of overseas employment by the centralisation of thework of the Ministry in this direction in the hands of the Overseas Employment Branch. .Part III. Press Comments.(1) The Labour and Socialist Press.Parliamentary and Municipal Politics.The phenomenal success of the Labour Party candidates in the recent municipalelections attracts the attention of all the papers. Some of them take this opportunityto draft a programme which the new Labour Councillors ought to pursue. Of the manyprogrammes, it may be noticed that Mr. F. W. Jowett, in his weekly article to the &quot; BradfordPioneer,&quot; calls special attention to the problem of housing, while Miss Sylvia Pankhurst,in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; emphasises the need for the establishment of a propermilk supply. It is noticeable, however, that many of the I.L.P. journals have not too muchconfidence in the future. They fear that the new Labour majorities will not be able to fulfil their promises to the electorate, and summon local Labour bodies to take steps tomeet a possible reaction. In a leading article, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; insists upon thedifficulty of the problem of Municipal Government, and expresses the opinion that thenew Councillors &quot; cannot reasonably be expected to perform wonders within the next12 months.&quot; The motto which this weekly puts before the Municipal Labour Partiesis festina lente, a somewhat astonishing motto to find in a socialist article. &quot; Justice &quot;and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; both call attention to the need for increasing the powers ofmunicipalities, which indeed is an indispensable preliminary to the carrying out of theLabour Municipal Programmes. Mr. F. W. Jowett suggests that representatives of the municipal authorities which Labour now dominates should meet in conference and agree upon some policy that would force the hand of the Government. There is no referencethis week to the possible action of Labour majorities on Watch. Committees with regardto the Police and Prison Officers&apos; Union and to the so-called. &quot; Citizen Guards.&quot;The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; connects Municipal and Parliamentary politics. It thinks that the municipal elections have greatly increased the probability of a return at the nextelection of a Labour Party &quot; sufficiently large to be able to form a Government.&quot; Inview of this possibility, it emphasises its conviction that in the present ParliamentaryParty and among the Labour candidates already selected for the next election, there arevery few who are qualified for ministerial office. It makes an appeal, therefore, to localassociations to choose parliamentary candidates &quot; who possess education, political training and knowledge of international politics,&quot; and &quot; who will be able to hold their own againstthe clever and experienced parliamentarians who will be in opposition when the LabourParty is in power.&quot; The financial debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday andThursday, the 29th and 30th October, does not attract much attention. &quot;The most notice-able thing in the brief references to it is the condemnation by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,.in &quot; Forward,&quot; and Mr. Fenner Brockway, in the Merthyr &quot; Pioneer,&quot; of Mr. Clynes&apos;speech, while Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; thinks that the debate brought out very painfully the weakness as a whole of the opposition in the House of Commons.He thinks that the only effective criticism of the Government was contributed byMr. Hogge.- - *Governments Industrial Policy.There is some discussion of the various legislative proposals of which the ministry is at present in charge. The Industrial Courts Bill arouses most attention, but the criticismis marred by the fact that much of the material was written in ignorance of the actualterms of the Bill. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; and Mv. Philip Snowden both express a fear that the Bill may be a means of introducing compulsory arbitration. The view is that once the Bill is passed it would be a very easy matter for a short amending bill to becarried through to give effect to a scheme of this kind. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; paysspecial attention to the omission from the Bill of any proposal to make the awards of theCourt binding upon employers. The argument in favour of this omission, namely, thatit is unfair to make awards binding on only one of the parties is criticised. The &quot; NewStatesman &quot; puts forward the thesis that there is an essential difference between the two
parties to an industrial award. In the view of this paper to make an award obligatoryon employers is only to legalise a minimum wage, whereas, to make the same awardbinding on trade unions is to legalise a maximum wage. It points out that there are many precedents for the establishment of legal minimum rates, and thinks that theseprecedents suffice to justify the Government in extending the compulsory provisions of:the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Acts.The &quot; British Citizen &quot; quotes with approval the statement made by Mr. G. D. H.Cole*, on which these last remarks of the &quot; New Statesman &quot; apparently are founded.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; discusses the Bill in the light of three authorities the&quot; Daily Herald &quot; &quot; disclosure &quot;f the official communique of the 1st November, andMr. Cole&apos;s statement. Suspicion and contempt displayed towards the Government inthe first part of the article drawn from the &quot; Herald,&quot; is balanced by a sincere welcomein the second part to the provisions of the Bill with regard to Courts of Enquiry. Theconclusion of the article, based as it is upon Mr. Cole does not differ from the &quot;BritishCitizen &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman.&quot;The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; considers Lord Askwith&apos;s criticisms of labour exchanges. While this paper expresses a general dissatisfaction with some of the minorfeatures of the Exchanges, it deals in detail with Lord Askwith&apos;s criticisms, and answerseach in turn. The positive suggestions of this paper are that the Exchanges should bemore under the control of employers and employed, and that existing compulsoryunemployment insurance should be utilised and made universal. But while it suggeststhat it is now possible, much more than it was in 1911, to make extended Use of trade organisations, this journal insists that the State machinery of the Exchanges is indis-pensable as a basis and last reserve. Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; argues in favourof a universal unemployment insurance, but makes the suggestion that the unemploymentfund should be recruited by means of a special tax on employers&apos; profits.Russia.&quot; The Call &quot; celebrates the Second Anniversary of the so-called Russian soviet republic by publishing a special number containing many articles contributed for theoccasion. These articles contain little that is new. Colonel Malone is added to the crowd of witnesses in favour of the Soviet Government. The strong tendency of many ofthese writers to base prophecy on false historical analogy may be noted. The history ofthe French Revolution is a great source of these prophecies, but the history of the war,(used by Messrs. Williams, Quelch and Maclean) is a more popular and an easier fountainof analogy. The most noteworthy article is one by Mr. F. Willis, who discusses theanatomy of Sovietism. He maintains that the Soviet is no peculiarly Russian institution,but that the germ of the Soviet is contained in every Trades Council, and refers to recentstrikes (Johannesburg, Limerick, Winnipeg, and the railway strike) to show how easymay be the transition from one to the other. Messrs. Williams and Quelch show muchbelief in the cunning of &quot; International Financiers.&quot; Mr. R. Dell is the only writer to protest against any act of the Soviet Government; he protests against their restraint ofthe liberty of the Press.(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.The &quot; New World &quot; (published at Glasgow), the organ of the National Union of ex-Service Men, contains an article based upon the decision of the Australian Governmentto grant returned soldiers an additional gratuity amounting to Is. Zd. for every day ofservice over and above their rate of pay. This paper voices a demand on behalf of ex-Service men that British soldiers should receive &quot; back pay &quot; amounting to the differencebetween their actual earnings and the sum their pay would have amounted to had theybeen serving in the Australian Forces. A note on the National Union of Ex-Service Menappears in this Report, p. 406.(3) The Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement.Nil.* In the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; 3rd November,t The &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; 1st November.
Part IV. General Topics.Industrial Courts Bill,Much discussion on this Bill took place in the House on the Committee stage..Several amendments have been made. The most important of these provide that theMinister is to constitute panels of persons (including women) suitable to act as members -of a board of arbitration; that the Industrial Court can include one or more women;that equality of treatment is established as between&apos; employers and trade unions withregard to the publication of documents disclosed to the Court of Enquiry ; and thatthe Conciliation Act of 1896 will not be repealed by this Act.Miners and Nationalisation.; ,The miners&apos; campaign in favour of the nationalisation of the mines continues,Mr. SmilhVs illness has prevented his participation in it, but Mr. Frank Hodges andothers have been very active. Mr. Hodges on the 6th inst. spoke at a National Guilds&apos;League Meeting and suggested that the control of the mining industry would be achieved by the realisation of the scheme embodied in the Miners&apos; Draft Bill. On the 8th inst.Mr. W. Straker addressed a conference of Glasgow and District Co-operative Societydelegates, and maintained that the nationalisation of the mines would involve an annualeconomy of  25,000,000. This step to secure the help of the Co-operative Society is ofsome interest in connection with what was said in this Report a fortnight ago, with regardto the general movement in favour of closer working agreements between trade unions and co-operative societies. On the whole, the miners&apos; campaign, although it is notattracting much attention in the press, appears to be having considerable success. Various -motives actuate different sections of the miners in their advocacy of nationalisation.Thus it is reported that in Lanarkshire, nationalisation is approved because it is thoughtthat it will involve generous pensions at a comparatively early age. In North Staffordshireit is thought that, if nationalisation will result in&apos; the abolition of the system of contractingin the mines, it will be desirable. In general the miners&apos; leaders are displaying veryconsiderable skill in their stage-management of nationalisation, so as to make it appeara panacea for all the ills real and imaginary from which the miners suffer.Railwaymen.The Special Delegate Conference of the N.U.R. to consider the revision of the rules -of the Society concluded on the 7th inst. The alterations made in the rules were for themost part of domestic interest, but it is important to note that Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos;s positionof supremacy in the Union, Avhich the proposal to appoint an industrial secretary parifassu with him would have tended to weaken, was maintained by the decision that thenew secretary should be of lower status than he. Strike pay benefit has been increasedto 24s. per week. Mr. Thomas at the close of the Conference made a statement an-nouncing the strong determination shown by the Conference to get the present wage negotiations settled promptly and satisfactorily. In view of the recent Miners&apos; Conference,which devoted a great deal of attention to the cost of living, it is significant to note thatMr. J. H. Thomas in a speech at Workington on the 9th inst. dealt at some length withthe question of prices, and insisted that a reduction in the cost of living was more necessary than an increase in wages. It may be suggested that Mr. Thomas has no inten-tion of allowing trade unionism in general to think that the Miners&apos; Federation is anymore solicitous on their behalf than the railwaymen.Ex-Service Men.International Union of Ex-Service Men. This Union, which was referred to inthis Report, page 269, was founded in Glasgow in 1918 by a secession of members of theN.F.D.D.S.S. Its membership is reported to be over 7,000 with four branches in Glasgowand 10 others in various parts of Scotland. It is of an extremist type and is affiliated tothe Glasgow Workers&apos; Defence Committee.National Union of Ex-Service Men. It is reported that in six months this Unionhas grown from one branch of 50 members to well over 100 branches with a membership of nearly 100,000. The General Secretary, Mr. A. E. Mander, is of a very vigorous andsomewhat extremist type. It may be remembered that during the railway strike thisUnion frequently insisted on its whole-hearted support of the railwaymen.
- Government Discharges.The Prime Minister, accompanied by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lordof the Admiralty, the Minister of Labour and certain Government officials, received adeputation on the 7th inst. from the Municipal Councils of Portsmouth, Plymouth,Chatham, Gillingham and Rochester on the subject of the discharges from the dockyards.The Prime Minister announced that he had in mind the possibility of setting up a smallBusiness Committee representing the dockyard towns, the Admiralty, the Ministry ofShipping, the Ministry of Labour and the Board of Trade, with a view to consideringthe practicability of utilising dockyards for private shipbuilding.Labour Organisation.A joint conference was held on the 11th inst. between a sub-committee of theParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Railway Strike MediationCommittee and the trade union side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the national industrial Conference. A list of the representatives of these three bodies was given inthe Report for the week ending the 29th October, page 373. The purpose of the Con-ference was to consider the proposed General Staff for Labour. At the close of theConference it was announced that it was considered that the rapid extension of centralised&apos;control among the employers leading to united action by the employers&apos; interests, called for the establishment of some central authority representing trade union interests. AJoint Committee was appointed to consider ways, and means by which the powers and functions of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress may be re-- constituted to meet the requirements of the present position. The Sub-Committee is asfollows: H. Gosling, A. B. Swales, E. Bevin, R. Williams, G. D. H. Cole, A. Henderson-. and F. Bramley. It is interesting to note that, according to the decision of this conference,the formation of this centralised authority will be within the already existing constitutional machinery of the Parliamentary Committee. It appeared about a month ago that themore advanced section of Labour was inclined to consider that the parliamentary committee, which has shown itself conservative and somewhat backward, ought to besuperseded by some new central authority more vigorous and alert. The question of there organisation of the Parliamentary Committee has, of course, been under consideration for a very long time.. State Ownership of the Liquor Trade.A Labour Party and Trade Union Conference took place at Carlisle on the 8th inst.with the object of launching a Labour campaign on behalf of State ownership and controlof the liquor trade. A resolution was moved affirming the belief of the Conference in&apos;public ownership and control, and asking all Local Labour Parties and Trade Councils to&apos;press for the extension of the principle. Mr. J. H. Thomas spoke to the motion, and said that as prohibition would not be an acceptable proposition at this time to the workingclasses, the only alternative worth, considering was State purchase and control. He referredto a Bill which he understood the Government was drafting to abolish the Control Boardand set up Drink Commissioners, but he maintained that it was time for the Governmentto deal more boldly with the question.Trade Union Topics.Building Trade Workers. The committee appointed at a conference held four months.. ago, which was convened by the National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, todiscuss the amalgamation of the bricklayers, masons, plasterers, paviors, and slaters andtilers, met on the 18th October.   The following societies were represented: Society of;Operative Stonemasons of England and Wales;  National Association of Plasterers,Granolithic and Cement Workers; National Amalgamated Operative Street Masons&apos;,Paviors&apos; and Roadmakers&apos; Society of Great Britain and Ireland; Manchester Unity ofOperative Bricklayers&apos; Society, and the Operative Bricklayers&apos; Society.  The main points which the Committee recommend as the basis of amalgamation are as follows : The nameof the Society shall be the Amalgamated Union of Allied Building Trade Workers.  Thatthere shall be a minimum of nine geographical areas known as districts.  That the contri-butions shall be Gd. per week, and the members shall receive strike, lock-out, legal aid,. and unemployment benefits.  Sick, death, superannuation and additional benefits shall. be continued on the average experience of the societies who are parties to the amalgamation.Colliery Officials&apos; Unions. A meeting of officials of the Colliery Officials&apos; Unions ofi South Wales and Monmouthshire, and Lancashire, Cheshire and Nottingham was held atHereford recently to consider the question of fusion, with a view to the formation of anational organisation.   It has been decided to convene a meeting of representatives of thevarious county unions now in existence to consider the project.   The Northumberland. and Durham Association, it is reported, have already expressed a desire for affiliation.
Employers&apos; Associations.Federation of British Industries. It is reported that the Manchester District of theFederation of British Industries has decided against the proposal for the amalgamation of the Federation with the British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation.Dock and Riverside Labour Employers.-A National Council of Employers of dock and Riverside Labourers has been formed, and a special committee has been approvedto deal with the present application for increased wages by the Transport Workers&apos;Federation. The object is to secure full consultation and co-operation at all ports indealing with labour matters. No port is to have more than 10 representatives upon theNational Council, and the Committee of the Council is to have power to co-opt members for consultation on any particular question. The head office of the Council will be inLondon.   The scheme at present does not include employers in Irish ports.National Alliance of Employers and Employed.In connection with the development of district organisation by this body, a localrepresentative committee has recommended the formation of a North Stafford and DistrictArea Committee of Employers and Employed, with equal representation of both sides..The purpose of the committee would be to promote active co-operation in the treatment of questions generally affecting labour and employment in all trades and occupations, topromote the welfare of industrial workers and the efficiency of industries, and to act asthe district organisation of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed. Thecommittee would not, however, interfere in industrial disputes unless specially requestedto do so. The Area Committee would also set before itself the making of a local social and&apos;,industrial survey, and would consider general industrial and economic questions.International Labour Conference.The 8-hour day or 48-hour week was discussed at the sixth plenary session on the-4th November, but no decision was arrived at.  Mr. Barnes introduced the proposals of:the Organising Committee, which favours a 48-hour week with certain modifications.The resolution adopted by the International Congress of Working Women was also read ;this favours an 8-hour day and a 44-hour week.  Special committees were appointed todiscuss the employment of women and children in unhealthy processes ; the employmentof women before and after child-birth and also at night; the minimum age for the employ-ment of children and the employment of children at night.   On the following day theEmployers&apos; and Labour Groups held separate meetings to draw up independent proposals on the hours question.   At the seventh plenary session the discussion on hours was continued.  It was voted that the draft convention, prepared by the Organising Com-mittee, be adopted by the conference as a basis of discussion, but that the question of its application to tropical and other countries be referred in the first instance to a specialcommittee.  Mr. Marjoribanks then introduced the employers&apos; counter proposals, which,while recognising the principle of the 8-hour day and 48-hour week, aimed at making good..the present shortage of food and machinery and at securing a speedy return to normal,conditions.   It was suggested that 56 hours were justified in continuous industries with,successive shifts, and that in certain cases additional hours, not exceeding 300 a year,might be worked.  M. Jouhaux and Mr. Gompers strongly opposed the employers&apos;suggestions.   Representatives from Czecho-Slovakia, Sweden and Norway described thelawrs regulating hours in their respective countries, and suggested that the Organising;Committee should adopt the principles embodied in them.  The Labour group presented a resolution stating that as the Japanese workers&apos; delegate was absent owing to theprohibition in Japan of the right of free association, the conference should approach Japan,with a request to respect the free exercise of this right.On the 7th November, the Labour delegates presented their substitute draft on thehours&apos; question. They proposed the inclusion of commercial as well as industrial work ;the adoption of the 8-hour day as well as the 48-hour week, to become effective by July,1920 ; and that recommendations be made to all Governments to adopt the 44-hour week,with the Saturday half-holiday. They opposed overtime except in cases of emergencyor accident, with not over 70 hours a year in seasonal industries at time and a half.M. Jouhaux (France) introduced and Mr. Tom Shaw seconded these proposals.On the 10th inst. the conference concluded the discussion on the hours question, and:referred the draft suggested by the Organising Committee and all amendments to a com- ,mittee of 15. The commission set up to inquire into the admission of other States reported,in favour of admitting Finland, but against admitting Luxembourg, San Domingo and!Mexico.
Part V.-Departmental and District Reports.(1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appointments. During the week ending the 31st October, 1,070 candidates wereavailable for appointments. The number of candidates known to have been placedduring the week was 417, making a total up to the 31st October of 15,677.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the DistrictSelective Committees 11,104 applications for training, of which 7,657 have so far been sanctioned.Employment Department.Wwk of the Court of Referees. Up to the 30th October, 351,555 claims to out-of-workdonation had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number, 322,965had been heard by the Courts of Referees.
