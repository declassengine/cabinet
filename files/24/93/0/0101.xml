Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade.I circulate a draft of the above Bill,, which has beendiscussed with ihe representatives of the coalowners.   Asa result si prolongsq&quot; discussions the owners though opposedto the Bill in principle are agreed that if such a measureis to be passed into law thoy world prefer if to take theform of tjie present draft Bill rather than any other form.It seems probable therefore that serious objection in theHouse of Commons on the part of tho colliery owners interestswill be confined to the Second xieading stage and that theywill not as a body fight the Bill on points of detail.The principles of the Bill are:-(1) to continue the coal control more or less in itspresent farm.(2) To provide for the retention by the colliery owners of aggregate profits on coal getting to an amount equal to 1/2^for every ton .tf the aggregate tonnage of coal raised duringthe year ending the 31st March 1920, this, subject to certain/&apos;provisos, being the limit of the duration of the Aot. -iZ\ To provide for the distribution of this aggregateprofit amcng the owners in proportion to the standards adoptedfsr the determination of excess profits duty under theFinance Ho.2 Act 1915.   This last provision, however, ismodified by an arrangement whereby an increasing or de-creasing auount is taken by the colliery according towhether it has made an increase or a decrease in outputn*w as ocmpared with its output before the war*It should be noted &quot;that by the method of distributionof the Bum available for profits over the whole industryprovided in the Bill, all colliery owners (except in the rar**case of an owner with no  profits standard and no capital)will nw receive some .share of the profits, whereas pre-viously some undertakings received nothing.   The colliery owners are in favour of the principle of distributionadopted in this Bill.I should be glad to have the sanction of the cabinet for the introduction of the Bill into Parliament forthwith..A.C.GEDUES.25th November, 1919.
