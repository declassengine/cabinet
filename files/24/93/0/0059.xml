General.Nil.Part II. Departmental.Some Aspects of the Year&apos;s WorContinued.In the last issue of this Report a summary was presented, in broad outline, of themore prominent features of the year&apos;s work of the Ministry of Labour in dealing with thequestions arising out of employment. This summary may now be supplemented by asimilar review of the activities of the Ministry in exercising the great group of functionsconcerned with the guidance and organisation of the relations of employers and employed.(0 1924] 255 11/19  h &amp; 8 3 M
Prominent in this group stand the efforts of the Ministry to put the Whitley scheme into general operation, and thus bring together employers and employed by a permanentnational organisation in order to settle by common discussion and mutual agreement theconditions and organisation of their industry. During the past year the negotiationsconducted to this end by the department have met with a great increase of success. InOctober, 1918, only 11 Joint Standing Industrial Councils had been brought into existence.By April of this year the number had increased to 30. On the 21st October, with thenrst meeting of the Joint Industrial Council for the Cement Industry, the number ofCouncils formed reached a total of 50. Progress has not, however, been altogetherunchequered. The Industrial Council for Packing Case Making ceased to meet on the26th September owing to the withdrawal of the National Union of Packing Case Makerson the employees&apos; side. But the cause of this withdrawal, the lack of statutory powersto enforce the decisions of the Council regarding wages, is one which is likely to prove astumbling-block only in the case of industries which are not completely organised. Fullyorganised employers&apos; associations and trade unions alike find as a rule little difficulty in providing a sufficient sanction for their agreements without Government assistance.The most notable feature in the development of Industrial Councils during theyear lias been the application of the Whitley Scheme to the employees of local authoritiesand of Government Departments. The first step as regards local authorities was takenby the establishment of Joint Industrial Councils for Electricity Supply and Water WorksUndertakings, on which both local authorities and companies were represented on theemployers&apos; side. This was followed by the formation of Councils for Gas, Tramwaysand for manual workers employed in the non-trading services of local authorities.Progress in the establishment of similar organisations for the industrial employees ofGovernment Departments followed quickly on a meeting held late in February. The provi-sional committee then appointed to draft a constitution reported by April. The acceptanceof the draft constitution then produced for Joint Councils, and works and shop committees,was followed by meetings of officials and unionists for all departments except the AirMinistry, where the uncertainty of the personnel eventually to be employed has hithertoprevented action. Departmental Councils have been brought into existence for H.M.Office of Works and the Admiralty. In the case of the Admiralty, the DepartmentalCouncil have approved a constitution for yard and shop committees which is now being put into application. The constitutions of Departmental Joint Councils for H.M. stationery office, the War Office, and the Ministry of Munitions is now settled, and it is expectedthat the Councils will soon be established. The importance of the acceptance of this principle by the Government need hardly be emphasised.The first step towards the establishment of a National Joint Industrial Council forthe administrative and legal sides of the Civil Service was taken early in April, &quot;when ajoint committee was appointed. The report prepared was accepted on the 8th July, andthe National Industrial Council consequently called into existence, has already held two meetings.  Departmental Councils are to be set up for all Government departments.In many directions advances have been recorded in the establishment of the district councils and Works Committees which the Whitley Report postulates as essential for thefull operation of the principles Avhich it embodies. By May, 1919, eleven of the &quot;-Councilsthen in existence had set up District Councils, and most of the remainder had the matter under consideration. Works Committees were then being set up under the guidance ofthe Joint Industrial Councils for the China Clay, the Match Manufacturing,&apos; and the rubber industries. The matter was under consideration by a number of othercouncils. By October of this year over 20 of the Councils then in existence hadeither already formed or were in process of forming District Councils. In view of thespecial interest attaching to the adoption of the Whitley Scheme in local government, itmay be noted that the Joint Industrial Council for the Electricity Supply industry had already succeeded in setting up a number of District Councils, while theCouncil for Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) was takingsimilar action. Since that date a number of District Councils have been formed forother industries, notably by the Gas Joint Industrial Council, which has already setup District Councils in three areas, and is pushing on with the arrangements for settingup the seven other Councils required to cover the country. Progress in the establishmentof Works Committees has varied considerably according to the industries concerned, andhas usually followed some little time after the formation of the District Councils. thus the Joint Industrial Council for the Gas Industry has at present only reached the stage of discussing a draft constitution for Works Committees, and the Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) Council lias only reached a similar stage.   In addition
to the China Clay, Matches and Rubber industries, Works Committees have now been set up for the Elastic Webbi ig and Wirefounding (Iron and Sbeel) industiies on theinitiative of the Industrial Councils. The following Councils are at present engaged intheir establishment: Pottery, Bobbins and Shuttles, Tramways, Coir Mat and Matting.Sub-Committees of the Councils for Boots and Shoes, Carpets and Wool have the matter under consideration, as well as the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees forOptical Instruments, Sugar Refining and Patent Fuel.Turning to the work of the Ministry connected with the administration of the Concilia-tion Act, 1896, and the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act, 1918, and with its generalconcern with trade disputes, a summarisation becomes a matter of more difficulty. Itmay be pointed out, however, that there has been a steady call by mutual consent ofemployers and employed, for the services of the Department. The number of casescoming each month before the Wages and Arbitration Department which have been sentto arbitration has remained throughout the year in the neighbourhood of 100, and hason occasion reached 140. The extension of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act inMay, 1918, involved a continuance of the work of the Department in this direction, whichwill be further prolonged with the passing of the Bill now before Parliament. The workof the Court of Arbitration has been supplemented by that of the Munitions Tribunals inthe enforcement of the rates prescribed under the Wages Act. The department has alsobeen closely associated with the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act, both during its passage through Parliament and subsequently. An account of the part played by theDepartment in connection with trade disputes would be to all intents and purposes, to write the history of the great industrial quarrels of the year as well as of a large numberof disputes of varying sizes and importance which have been settled by the interpositionof the local officers of the Ministry. Special mention may, however, be made of the factthat the Wages and Arbitration Department were intimately concerned with the arrange-ments made for the Industrial Conference during the early months of this year, and the meetings of the Provisional Joint Committee which followed. The legislation for the enforcement of a 48-hour week and the establishment of a Minimum Wage Commission,now under consideration by Parliament in accordance with the Prime Ministersacceptance of the recommendations of the Industrial Conference, have involved muchwork by the Department and promise still more in the future. -The activities of the Ministry in the establishment of Trade Boards for poorly paid and ill-organised industries were recently touched upon in this Report, * and may be passed over with correspondingly brief mention in this place. The number of Trade Boards inexistence at the date of the armistice was thirteen, covering eight industries. At themoment of writing, 22 Trade Boards are in operation in Great Britain and Ireland, andtheir numbers will shortly be increased. Special mention may be made of the expansionof the establishment of Trade Boards in Ireland. In March, 1919, five such Boardswere in existence, for tailoring, shirt maldng, paper box making, food preserving and sugar confectionery, and linen and cotton embroidery. The list has since been increasedby the establishment of Trade Boards for &quot;boot and shoe repairing and tobacco, andTrade Boards will shortly come into operation for brush and broom making, fur, thelaundry trade, and paper bag making.Part III.-Press Comments.(1) The Labour and Socialist Press.Russia.The Prime Ministers speech at the Guildhall on the 8th November has a variedreception in these papers.The &quot; Nation &quot; is frankly pleased with, and grateful for, the speech, and builds upon it a forecast of a peace conference between the various local parties concerned, at whichrepresentatives of the Allies will be present. It ascribes to the Prime Minister the definiteintention of promoting such a conference, and thinks that in his endeavour he deservesall support. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is less enthusiastic in its approval and somewhatsatirical in its tone, but it, too, gives its support to the Prime Minister. Both thesejournals notice the criticisms which have been passed upon the speech in &quot; The Times &quot;and &quot; Daily Mail,&quot; and appear to have been influenced by opposition to them to take up /* See this Report for the 15 oh October, 1919, p. 321.(C 1924) 3 M 2
an attitude more favourable towards the Prime Minister. The LL.P. papers are less concerned with the personal position of the Prime Minister; Mr. Jowett, in the &quot; BradfordPioneer,&quot; and Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; both proclaim lack of personalconfidence in him. In his willingness to pursue a peace policy however they have faith, \jand they use Mr. Bullitfs statements to the American Senate Committee on foreign relations to show how necessary it is for the Labour movement to counter the press campaing against a more peaceful policy towards Russia. A substantially similar attitude is taken up by the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought.&quot;While these papers, however, attribute a certain amount of importance to the speech and think that it does mark an impending change of policy on the part of the Government,the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; in a leading article and the &quot; Socialist&quot; express the opinionthat it should be neglected. They concentrate rather upon the inactivity shown by theParliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. with regard to the Glasgow resolution on Russianpolicy. Indeed it would seem that this last topic would have been the leading featurethis week of the discussions in the Labour and Socialist Press, had it not been for thePrime Ministers speech. Mr. Philip Snowden in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; in an articlewritten before the 8th November, deals with the history of the Southport Labour Party,and the Glasgow T.U.C., resolutions on the subject of Russia. The conduct of theParliamentary Committee is described as &quot;contemptible and cowardly,&quot; and the tradeunions are recommended to take immediate action. Mr. Arthur Siffleet, in &quot; The Call/&quot;puts forward similar views, but is at more pains to condemn the Parliamentary LabourParty, the leaders of which he attacks for their lack of faith in Bolshevism. Mr. ramsay macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; gives currency to a rumour he has heard that the Russianquestion played a great part in deciding the municipal elections and reproaches theParliamentary Party for their poor attendance in the division on Colonel Wedgwood&apos;amendment to the Army estimates.Prices.The question whether the price of coal should or should not be reduced is now becoming a subject of much discussion in the Labour and Socialist Press. Mr. A. C. Edwards, M.P.,deals with the matter in the &quot; British Citizen.&quot; He criticises the statistics upon whichthe increase in price was based and alleges that no provision was made in the calculationsfor the abnormal amount of exploration and development work that was then being putin hand. He calls for a full account of the financial working of the coal control schemeand maintains that the public have a right to determine for themselves whether the increasedprice was justifiable. Mr. T. Kennedy in &quot; Justice &quot; does not wait for any such accountsbefore passing judgment. He describes the increase as the result of a &quot; game of blunderand bluff &quot; and concludes that the purpose of the game was to create a bias in the public mind against the principle of nationalisation. It may be noted in this connection thatMr. H. M. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; devotes an article to the consideration of the domesticfood situation which he describes as serious. His remarks are largely based uponproceedings of the Consumers&apos; Council. He reproaches the Government for lack ofinitiative but compliments Mr. McCurdy on the. way in which he proposes to use theProfiteering Act. The &quot; New Age &quot; continues to believe that the maintenance of present prices is the deliberate object of the Government^ considered policy.Industrial Policy.The passing of the Industrial Courts Bill through the House of Commons does not receive much attention in the papers. The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times,&quot; however, devotesan article to the subject. This paper complains that the Government have been using the need for the extension of the Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act in order to go asfar towards compulsory arbitration as they dared. The composition of the industrial courts is criticised on the ground that the &quot;independent persons,&quot; who are to be the chairmen of the divisions of the Court, will always be against the Labour interest, whilethe Courts of Inquiry are objected to on the ground that the press will always be ableto make use of their reports to influence public opinion in favour of capital. The greaterpart of the article, however, consists of complaints against the procedure adopted by theParliamentary Committee of the T.U.C. in dealing with the matter. The &quot; YorkshireFactory Times &quot; maintains that the Bill concerns all the Trade Unions, and that thepredominance given in consultations upon it to the engineering and shipbuilding unionshas been unfair. This paper and the &quot; New Statesman &quot; also complain that the bill has been rushed through Parliament and that the preliminary consultations and theParliamentary debates upon it have been entirely perfunctory.  The &quot; Cotton Factory
Part IV.-General Topics.The General Situation.The period of conference and discussion that succeeded the upheaval caused by therailway strike still continues, and there is every prospect that it will continue for at least three or four weeks yet. The strike taught trade unionism that although a temporary-tactical advantage may be obtained from a &quot; lightning &quot; strike, the fact that such preci-pitate action prevents adequate internal organisation and consultation with other unionshas strategical disadvantages which are exceedingly grave in a campaign on a large issue.Accordingly, Labour has in the past weeks been busily engaged in conferences on a great variety of important issues. In some cases these are with the Government, but more oftenthey are with other Labour bodies with a view to perfecting internal Labour organisation.It is noteworthy that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress is taking a prominent part in these negotiations. The constitution of a general staff for labour, the promotion of closer working between Trade Unionism and the Co-operative movement these are only two of the important matters which the Parliamentary Com-mittee is investigating and discussing. At present everything in the Labour world is working towards the special Trades Union Congress to be held on the 9th and 10thDecember, to discuss nationalisation, the cost of living, Russia and other subjects. Aseries of other important issues which emerge from the general situation are noted inthis Part of the Report.Labour Policy and the Triple Alliance.It is interesting to note that a remarkable change has occurred in the last few months in the way in which Labour presents its claims. During the summer far-reaching demands were made with violent threats of &quot; direct action,&quot; revolutionary resolutions were passed,and a spirit of revolt was abroad against the slow-moving constitutional central machineryof Labour represented by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.The prime agent in this movement was the Triple Alliance. Now, however, the position has significantly altered. The constituent organisations of the Triple Alliance haveapparently varied their policy. When they want something done, they do not now calla special conference of the Triple Alliance. They refer the matter instead to the Parlia-mentary Committee.  This was notably the case when the M.F.G.B. raised the question* Reported in the &quot; Morning Post,&quot; 11th inst.&apos; Times &quot; refers to Lord Askwith&apos;s criticism of Labour Exchanges at a meeting organised by the National Party at Bradford.* This paper expresses agreement with Lord Askwithand submits that there does not remain any reason for the existence or maintenance ofthe Labour Exchanges.Municipal Election Results.It was noted last week that the phenomenal success of Labour Party candidates inthe recent municipal elections was causing a certain amount of uneasiness in I.L.P. circles.In this week&apos;s papers, there are also signs of a reconsideration of many opinions in the lightof the situation which these election successes have created. &quot; Eob Roy,&quot; in&quot;Forward,&quot; expresses pleasure at the municipal election results, and trusts thatthey will clear away the doubts which have become somewhat prevalent in labour circles since last December, as to the utility of representative institutions. Inthis connection it is of interest to note that &quot; The Call &quot; thinks it advisable to publish a-leading article explaining to the members of the B.S.P. how useful it is to contest Parlia-mentary elections, and suggesting that Parliament is no more a Capitalist institutionthan are the trade unions. Messrs. Fairchild and Alexander recently left the B.S.P. inthis very issue. Apparently the municipal elections have caused a slight revision in theattitude of the B.S.P. The plaint of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; last week which was,in effect, that local Labour Parties are not putting forward enough I.L.P. men as Parlia-mentary candidates, is taken up this week in the &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; Clarion.&quot; The&quot;Clarion&quot; unreservedly condemns the attitude of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and declaresits confidence in the ability of the Labour Party, to manage its own affairs and preserveitself from the influence of the so-called &quot;defeatist intellectuals of the I.L.P.&quot;(2) Ex-Service Men&apos;s Periodicals.Nil.
of the cost of living. Had this issue been brought into prominence at midsummer, there&apos;can be little doubt that the M.F.G.B. would have referred it to the Triple Alliance ratherthan to the Parliamentary Committee. From the standpoint of trade unionism the change is probably all for the better. The existence of such a body as the Triple Alliance, eagerto arrogate to itself, not only the hegemony of the Trade Union movement, but also the rightto speak and act on large vital issues on its own responsibility for the whole Labour moye-ment, was a danger not only to the State as a whole, but equally to the Trade union movement itself. It is some realisation of.the latter fact by the constituent unionsof the Alliance that has led to the change that has taken place. The Triple Alliance mayhave an important role to play in the Labour movement, but that function will be fiil-filled in a way that will be to the advantage of the Labour movement as a whole only ifsuch duties are imposed upon it by a central authority such as a re-organised parliamentary committee. The Triple Alliance, as it attempted to function in the summer, with itsendeavour to dictate to the Labour movement as a whole, was bound eventually to bea source of weakness to the general movement. But if it is content on large matters ofpolicy to be guided by a duly constituted central Labour authority, it may well be aninvaluable weapon, a sort of spear-head. It will be interesting to see, however, whetherand to what extent the Alliance will be affected by the changes in status already conceded,to the railwaymen and now being vigorously demanded by the miners.Industrial Courts Bill.This Bill as amended in Committee was discussed on the 14th instant by a Conference-attended by representatives of the Parliamentary Committee of the T.U.C., the TradeUnion side of the Provisional Joint Committee of the National Industrial Conference,the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation, the A.S.E. and the General Workers&apos;Federation. Mr. Henderson presided. Opposition was expressed to the two clauses ofthe Bill which rendered it optional on the part of the employers to refer disputes to arbitration and to carry out awards given as the result of arbitration. It was contended that in both cases the Bill should be compulsory. At the close of the discussion, theConference by a majority of 30 to 14 decided to approve of the third reading. this bill was read a third time on the 17th instant.Out-of-Work Donation.The Government has decided to discontinue out-of-work donation to civilian menand women. It is proposed, however, to continue the donation to ex-service men andwomen. The question was debated fh the House in Committee of Supply, on the19th inst., and on a free vote the proposals of the Government were carried. It isintended soon to introduce in the House the Government scheme for compulsory un-employment insurance on a contributory basis.Railwaymen.The negotiations between the railwaymen and the Government on the standardisation,of wages and the control of the railways continue.   A meeting took place between theN.U.R. and the Prime Minister on the 13th instant and on the 14th the executive of theN.U.R. considered the new proposals of the Government.  On the 18th instant they werefurther discussed at a joint conference of the executives of the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E. &amp; F..These proposals involve as an interim measure, with regard to the standardisation ofwages, the discussion by four sub-committees representing respectively locomotive men,goods workers, permanent way staff and traffic department, the question of the wages for each grade and department.  As a permanent measure for the management of the-railways the following scheme is being discussed.(1) A Joint Committee, to take the place of the Railway Executive Committee, onwhich the N.U.R. will have two representatives and the A.S.L.E. &amp; F. one.(2) A Joint Board composed of five General Managers and five representatives ofthe Unions, three belonging to the N.U.R. and two to the A.S.L.E. &amp; F.to deal with all questions relating to conditions of service.(3) A National Railway Board of thirteen; four being representatives of the RailwayCompanies, four nominees of the Railway Unions, four representatives of thegeneral public as railway users, with an independent Chairman.   This Board ,would deal with questions on which the Joint Board fails to agree.(4) District Boards would be set up locally, with an equal number of representatives,of the railway management and men to deal with local grievances.
These schemes were explained at public meetings during the week-end by Mr. J.&quot;Thomas at Bristol, Mr. C. T. Cramp at Nuneaton, and Mr. J. Bromley at Hitdbin.Mr. Thomas announced that the railwaymen would accept the Government&apos; proposals:not as their final goal, but as a stepping-stone on the path that would enable them to septhat as workers they had co-equal power and co-equal authority in management. he did not think that the scheme would necessarily render strikes impossible, but he maintained that if the new machinery were properly worked in a fair spirit on both. sides, it would do much to ensure smooth working on the railways.It should be noted that the negotiations with regard to wages are quite independent of the larger scheme dealing with the control of the railways. The proposed machineryhas not yet assumed a final form. Many points are still being discussed, and it isprobable that representation will also be granted to the RCA.Nationalisation of the Mines.A Joint Conference of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union congress and the executive of the M.F.G.B. was held on the 12th instant to make arrangementsfor the special Trades Union Congress to be held on the 9th and 10th of December, totake action on the resolution of the Trades Union Congress at Glasgow with reference tothe nationalisation of the mines. It was also decided to form a Joint Committee to workput the details of a national publicity campaign in support of nationalisation. Miners,leaders continue to address demonstrations throughout the country. On the 14th instantMr. Hodges predicted that a serious situation would probably arise between now and march of next year, because no political avenue was open by which the people couldexpress their will on the new constructive ideas that had been brought to their notice.Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.A conference between the negotiating Committee of the Engineering and Ship-building Trade Unions and the Employers&apos; Federation was held on the 11th instant todiscuss the question of a further reduction of hours in those trades to 44 hours per week.Considerable discussion took place, but in the end the Union representatives announcedthat they would refer the matter again to their respective executives. On the same day Mr. G. J. Wardle had a conference with representatives of the Engineering and Ship-building Trade Unions on the question of the application of the maintenance and traininggrants scheme for ex-officers and men of similar educational qualifications in theengineering and allied trades. In the end the matter was adjourned for furtherconsideration.Ai-Hour Week.It is announced that the Boilermakers&apos; Society has drafted a Bill for a 44-hour week for all industries. This Bill was introduced to the Parliamentary Committee of the TradeUnion Congress on the 12th instant and the Committee decided that it should be sentto all the Unions for their observations and suggestions.. It is understood that after this the measure may be introduced into Parliament and an official request will be madeto the Government to facilitate its passage.Police.A deputation from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress andthe Labour Party waited upon the Home Secretary on the 12th instant to press for the reinstatement of the discharged police strikers. The Police Union has received financialassistance from the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, and theannual delegate conference of the United Builders&apos; Labourers&apos; Union recommend to their members a 6d. levy in support of the police.Russia.The recrudescence of general interest in Russia coincides with a revival of thes demandsof labour in connection with the attitude of the Government. A Joint Meeting of theParliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress and the Labour Party on the12th instant discussed the Russian situation and passed a resolution welcoming thePrime Ministers statement at the Guildhall. The conference between the executive ofthe M.F.G.B. and the Parliamentary Committee earlier in the day had decided to ask the Prime Minister to receive a deputation to discuss the question. The second sessionof the special Trade Union Congress to be held on the 10th December will discuss theBritish policy in Russia, as well as other topics.  The Secretary of the London Labour
Party has sent a letter to the Prime Minister on behalf of his executive, containing a.resolution demanding intervention in Russia and demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations between Russia and this country.Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement.With further reference to the movement for developing a closer alliance betweentrade unionism and the co-operative movement, which has several times been referred to&apos;recently in this Report, it should be noted that the Parliamentary Committee of theT.U.C. has appointed a special sub-committee to discuss closer working relations betweenthe trade unions and the co-operative movement. There are two ways in which this-&quot; entente &quot; is being consolidated. On the one hand, Trade Unions are withdrawing,their funds from ordinary &quot; capitalist&quot; banks and investing them in the Co-operative wholesale Society&apos;s Bank. It is reported that the tendency to do this is especially markedin the case of the engineering unions. In addition to this, Trade Unions are encouragingtheir members to deal with Co-operative Societies in the purchase of householdnecessaries. On the other hand, Co-operative Societies, as a quid pro quo, are making arrangements with trade unions to supply strike-benefit in the form of food, given againstfood-coupons to be honoured by the trade unions. Thus, the Co-operative Societyat Cardiff has circularised the trade unions expressing its willingness to considerapplications for the payment of strike or lock-out benefit by means of food coupons, and states that this machinery is being used by the ironfounders.Ex-Service Men&apos;s Grievances.Ex-Service men continue to have grievances against (1) trade unions, and (2)&apos;employers. In many districts the men attribute their unemployment to the attitude ofthe trade unions, especially the A.S.E., and the feeling of the men is very bitter. Theorganising secretary of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised sailors and Soldiers, speaking at Coalville on the 15th inst., complained of the attitude of theA.S.E. to trained ex-Service men, and announced that the Federation would fight the engineers on the matter. In Liverpool and throughout the Midlands unemployedex-Soldiers are very aggrieved at the poor response made to the King&apos;s appeal. On the9th November, at Birmingham, a resolution was passed that if this appeal did not meet with the necessary response the Government should formulate a scheme under which employers would be forced to absorb all unemployed ex-Service men. A similarresolution was passed by the Bolton branch of the National Federation of Discharged andDemobilised Sailors and Soldiers.International Labour Conference, Washington,On the 12th and 13th instant the International Labour Conference devoted its time^to discussing the question of the admission of Finland to membership. Signor Baldesi(Italy), who presented the majority report of the Committee on Admission, recommendedthat Finland should be admitted on the ground that the conference, at the suggestion of theSupreme Council, had already admitted Germany and Austria, which are. not members of:the League of Nations, and that the Supreme Council specifically referred the question of; admitting Finland to the conference believing that it was necessary to bring the greatest possible number of States into the organisation. Mr. Rowell (Canada), presenting the minority report, held that the admission of Finland would not be legal, because the Treatyprovided for admission through membership in the League of Nations. Senator Von Koch.(Sweden), Senator Neumann (Denmark) and Judge Castberg (Norway) supported the admission of Finland. Sir Malcolm Delevigne protested strongly against what he calledan attempt to alter the meaning of the Peace Treaty. He called attention to the fact/that the admission to the conference of a State which had not intended to join the Leagueof Nations was a question of principle striking at the very root of the labour organisation,,and tending to divorce that organisation from the League. He gave notice that GreatBritain would not approve the admission of Finland otherwise than as provided by theTreaty, and that if the conference decided otherwise, she would require that the questionbe referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The discussion was continued on the 13th instant, and Mr. Stuart Bunning said that Finland&apos;s admission wouldbe no more irregular than that of Germany and Austria, which had already been admitted.On the ,other hand, her exclusion would justify the reproach that because Germany and austria were powerful nations and formidable competitors, they were admitted irregularly,,while Finland, a small country, was excluded.  Eventually, Finland was admitted
Part V. Departmental and District Reports.(1) Departmental Reports.Appointments Department.Appointments. During the week ending the 7th November, 1,085 candidates wereavailable for appointments. The number of candidates known to have been placed duringthe week was 472 making a total to the 7th November of 16,149.Training Grants Scheme. The Grants Committee have received from the DistrictSelective Committees 11,465 applications for training, of which 8,127 have so far been sanctioned.Employment Department.Work of the Court of Referees. Up t) the 6th November, 357,815 claims to out-of-workdonation had been referred to appeals officers in Great Britain. Of this number 328,826-had been heard by the Courts of Referees. An analysis of 314,133 claims heard showsthat 80,742 were allowed, 232,861 disallowed, and in 530 a compromise was effected. Theproportion of disallowances to claims heard is therefore 74*1 per cent. Of the total dis-allowances 45*8 per cent, were disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable employment.Prosecutions for Fraud-TJip to the 14th November, 1,517 cases had been referred tothe Solicitor with a view to prosecution for attempted fraud in connection with out-of-workdonation. In 615 cases the defendant was fined, in 160 imprisoned, in 61 bound over,and in six admonished.  In 151 cases the summonses were dismissed.Unemployment. On the 7th November, 478,638 men and 85,498 women were on thelive register.  Vacancies remained available for 28,796 men and 42,884 women.  The(C 1924) 3 Nunanimously to the conference by the adoption of a compromise resolution as follows : &quot; The conference, without giving a ruling on the question of principle, welcomes the delegates nominated by Finland, and invites them to take part in the conference on thesame conditions as obtain in the case of other countries, which have not yet been admitted to the League of Nations.&quot;A short plenary session was held on the 17th instant, at which it was reported thatall the work on the agenda was in the hands of committees, and that the various reportswould begin to be received probably by the 19th instant. It has been arranged thatthese reports should be submitted as early as possible, in order that each day theconference may pass a final decision on some part of its programme.The two great outstanding issues are the final solution of the eight-hour day or theforty-eight hour week, and the constitution of the International Labour Office. Theformer is complicated by the fact that while some States that now recognise the Saturdayhalf holiday are naturally willing to accept more than eight hours during other days ofthe week, other States complain that they are bound by strict eight-hour laws. Thequestion of overtime is full of difficulty. It appears that Mr. Gompers is pressing for thelimitation of overtime to seventy-five hours per annum for five years, and thereafter its total abolition. In the British forty-eight-hour Bill systematic overtime will not be permitted, unless with the express sanction of the Minister of Labour. In consideringsanction, the Minister would have regard to the general conditions in the industry, andmight in practice frequently limit overtime below 300 hours per annum. The constitutionof the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, which is to be the permanentlabour organisation connected with the League of Nations, is complicated by the factthat the choice of the eight States of chief industrial importance has been protested againstby five other States, namely, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Spain and India. It is thoughtthat a solution of this problem can be found, as the constitution provides that twelveStates shall be represented on the Governing Body by Government representatives, but does not at the same time insist that the six employers&apos; and six workers&apos; delegates mustbe from the same States.It was reported to the conference that the German delegates would sail fromGothenberg on the 18th instant. A reply was immediately sent stating that as manyof the delegations had secured berths to leave America on the 3rd December, the conference had set the 29th November as a tentative date for adjournment. Regret was expressed at the possibihty that events might prevent the Germans from arriving in time for theconference. The Austrian Delegation at Paris sent a telegram to the conference regrettingthat it could not send representatives, but wishing to transmit its best wishes for thesuccess of the conference.

The Live Register for the week ending the 31st October shows atotal decrease of 997, representing a decrease of 788 men and 209 women. The ironfounders&apos;strike is responsible fcfr the increase at Colchester; the cessation of army contracts andthe progress of demobilisation for the increase at Northampton. It is reported fromLetchworth that engineering firms have almost exhausted their stock of castings and willin consequence be compelled to discharge their workpeople.Employment of Ex-Service Mew.-During the period under review 113 undertakings in respect of the National Scheme have been accepted by Employment Committees, and156 undertakings are under consideration.South-Western.Unemployment.

The Plebs League is penetratinginto industries other than mining, and is regarded as a serious menace to trade unionauthority and discipline by reason of its emphasis on the Shop Stewards&apos; Movement.Metalliferous Mining. The condition of metalliferous mining in Wales is causing considerable anxiety, as it is at present impossible to carry on the great majority of the lead and zinc mines, and of approximately 130 only three are believed to be producing.The root of the difficulty appears to be the multiplication of small competing concerns,but it is believed that with organisation and the provision of facilities for co-operation in processes, the industry can be made self-supporting and capable of withstandingcompetition.Scotland.Unemployment. The Live Register for the week ending the 31st October shows atotal increase of 854, representing an increase of 1,111 men and a decrease of 257 women.Unemployment at Inverness has reached its highest figure in the history of the localExchange. The increase is accounted for to a certain degree by increased discharges fromthe Dockyard at Invergordon. Some relief is expected from the opening of a new Tweedwarehouse, and from the promotion of toy making as a new industry, which is underconsideration. The situation at Leith is still very critical, and little improvement hasbeen made in the situation at the docks. The prolonged strike of furnace bricklayers is seriously affecting employment at Paisley, Coatbridge, Wick and Alloa.Shortage of Material. Inadequate supplies of iron to meet the demands of shipbuildersare reported at Leith. About 80 per cent, of the staff of Messrs. J.

In the meantime the N.U.R. has agreed to call out the moulders employed in railway shops, who have hithertocontinued work, since they are not members of the unions concerned in the strike.

The AssociatedIronmoulders of Scotland having conferred with the English strikers&apos; representatives, haveballoted their members on the question of joining the strike.

It is f-tated that the delay of the Government andthe Owners&apos; Associations in coming to an agreement as to the hours and conditions of membersof the Colliery Enginemen, Firemen and Mechanics&apos; Union is causing grave unrest in theMidlands coalfield.

It is reported that there is considerabledissatisfaction with the recent award of 5s. to workers in the engineering and shipbuildingtrades.

On the adjustment of war wages, it is provided that the old sliding scale shall be so altered that war wages shall rise and fall one point for every point by whichthe index figure rises and falls, so long as this exceeds 100. When it falls below 100, warwages will move in a ratio of * 8426 for every point in the index figure, so that if the latterfalls to zero the operatives will still retain 25 per cent, of the war wage.Lace Makers.
