3 ICfetnSNT 13 THE PLOPEKTY CP HIS doubt TAHITI 0 UAJEgTY* 3 QCVERITIMT).^    SECRET     w) G,,A D I 1-7 E TCP, 107H^UBIimMemorandum,from tho First 0ommladies.ofthe CfaMnot&quot;With reference to the Memoranda &quot;by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer ani the Minister of Health of ifhe 7th November andthe 87th October re ipeetively (CP.75: and CP.5) it la clearthat, as was anticipated some time ago in previous memoranda,the provision of the very large number of hou-ea that had&quot;become urgently necessary under the Government Housing Scheme,will not be practicable if the Government ro rely rely uponthe effort,; of the Local Authorities, and it is already apparent that through relying upon the Local Authoritiea a.j the main prop,the jo he 00 ii breaking down,The Minister of Health proposes now to.utilise theservices of my Department for the provision of the necessaryhouses if the efforts of the Local Authorities fail to materialise,I suggested uome time ago that my Lepartmont should be entrusted- with the Government Housing Genome, wh:ch should really be run by the Gove rnment Building Department with a central controland organisation, not only of the various achemee, but al.i0of the provision of labour and materials, on a systematic plan,,Thi j. would have obviated many of the difficulties which have occurred - such as competition for labour and materials by alarge number of different authorities, which la continuallyraising the prices of both, and does not lead to the most effective re.ni.lta.It 1, probably too lute to revive this proposal now, butI am Quite ready to aa^iat the Minister of Health to the limits of the capacity of my Department as at present organised, butI must point out that the Department is Bsriously understaffedto carry out the ne.; duties which have been east upon it during the last few years, and if it L to   undertake HousingSchemes, on a large scale, I must have authority to makealterations and additions to rny organisation - both secretarialand technical - to enable me tc undertake the work.In this connection it must be realised by the Treasurythat I must have a freer hand/thai, in the past to deal, with both thenumbers and remuneration of the necessary staff.     Other newDepartments have been allowed to create organisations in whichvery much more generous salaries are paid, especially to technical members.With regard to tho question of finance, referred to bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, it appears to me that if theGovernment intends to oarry through their Housing Scheme, theymust be prepared for a very bold financial policy.     Thedifficulty of the situation can, in ay opinion, only be met by having a very large National Housing Loan, secured on theproperties, which could be gradually transferred to the LocalAuthorities as they take over the completed schemes.    Thefact must also be faced, t&amp;at.,&apos;. in view of the enormous cost ofbuilding at tho present time,, a considerable loss of capital
capital must be incurred if houses are to belet at a- reasonable rent, even if such rentss could only be expected\ be considerably higher than pro-war rate a,.-The real question to be consideredis whether the present housing position is to be looked on as an aftermath of war conditions andany loss involved regarded as part of the cost Ofthe war, Or, whether it is to be treated      sly as aneoonomic problem by itself.     In view of all the declarations by the Prime Minister and mothersof the Government, the first of these two viewsseems to me to be the correct one.(Signed)   A. Mond.H..M..
