C.Treasury, S.W., November 11, 1919.Mr. Blackett,I send you herewith an advance copy of the report of the special Sub-commission at Vienna set up by the Organisation Committee to report on the condition of Austria.A glance will suffice to show that it raises financial and political questions of the firstmagnitude.There is to be a special meeting to-morrow of the Finance Section, and of a Sub-Committee of the Organisation Committee, to study this report and recommend to theOrganisation Committee what action should be taken. I hope that we shall advise theOrganisation Committee somewhat to the following effect that the report, which hasreceived the unanimous agreement of the Sub-Commission, raises financial questionsupon which the Finance Section, owing to their magnitude, finds it impossible toexpress even a provisional opinion ; that it also raises questions of high policy uponwhich the Organisation Committee cannot pronounce ; that it should therefore transmitthe report to the Supreme Council for the consideration of the Allied Governments,with an expression of opinion by the Organisation Committee as to the advisability of accepting the main conclusion to which consideration of the report leads, andentrusting, in effect, the administration of Austria to the Reparation Commission,always provided that the Allied and Associated Governments can, and are willing to,supply the necessary capital.It will of course be equally beyond the competence of the Supreme Council tocome to any decision on this sort of question. They in turn will have to refer thethe matter to their respective Governments for consideration. So long as the supreme council is in existence, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to avoid this link in a somewhat complicated chain of procedure.Sir John Bradbury will doubtless be communicating his views at some length tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer. Meanwhile, I have thought that it would be an advantage to you to have this early information. The question really seems to boildown to this : Will the Allies leave Austria to stew in her own juice, and, if so, willthey continue to prevent a natural amalgamation with Germany ; if not, are theyprepared to put their hands pretty deeply into their pockets in order to providecapital, on which they might receive interest, and which might be returned to themintact after a generation ? If they contemplate the second course, presumably theywill not act without American co-operation, which it may be exceedingly difficult toobtain.Sir William Goode is going to London early next week, -and, with Sir john bradbury&apos;s approval, will probably see the Prime Minister. I expect that theChancellor of the Exchequer would also desire to see him.(Signed)        A. McFADYEAN26, Rue de Bassano, Paris,November 7, 1919.[1445J B
Report of the Vienna Sub-Commission of the Organising Committee of theReparation Commission.Sir, &quot; Vienna, November&apos; 4, 1919.In accordance with instructions this Sub-Commission Commenced its sittings inVienna on the 24th October, and, in view of the critical nature of the situation un austria, find it imperative to make an interim report. The figures as to therequirements contained in this report were submitted, in the first place, by theMinisters and advisers of the respective Austrian Government departments. TheMinisters themselves were closely examined by the Sub-Commission, and their estimates were then submitted to analysis by British food and commercialrepresentatives resident in Vienna. They were then re-examined by the Sub-Commission, and, although they must necessarily be subject to revision in detail, theymay be accepted as presenting a fairly accurate summary of the situation.The Governors of all the provinces or their representatives were summoned to give their views, particularly as to the exchange of merchandise between their respectiveprovinces, with the idea in view of producing an economic balance in Austria. Variousfinancial experts and representative industries also were summoned and gave theiropinions on technical subjects. By the information obtained in this way the Sub-Commission were able to form a true idea of the situation. All they have heard has ledto a certainty that Austria is in a critical situation and has an immediate need of food and coal.J. Need of Food.The visible supplies, including the present harvest and counting on the completefulfilment of all contracts entered into with the various countries, would only enableAustria to provide herself with cereals for three months more during the present cerealyear, and for a shorter period as regards meat, milk, and fats. The Sub-commission are convinced that a number of food contracts with other countries will not. be fulfilled.It must therefore be estimated that Austria will be compelled to import 632,000 tonsof food supplies for nine months of the cereal year ending September 1920, at a totalapproximate cost of 100,000,000 dollars.The failure of the neighbouring States to deliver foodstuffs contracted for byAustria, and the difficulties of obtaining and transporting food supplies within Austriaitself, have brought Vienna, which constitutes about half of the total population, to thebrink of starvation. On Wednesday, the 29th October, the Austrian Food Controllerreported to the Sub-Commission that there were no breadstuffs whatever in hand inVienna, as they had all been distributed as rations for the current week, which ended the following Monday ; while of fats, meat, or any other foodstuffs controlled by theGovernment they had nothing. *There is no reason tor doubt the accuracy of this statement. At the same time it should be mentioned that on the 29th October therewere in transit from Trieste breadstuff supplies which, if duly delivered, would rationVienna to the 11th November.The gravity of the position lies in the probable recurrence of these acute shortagesand the impossibility of relying upon railway deliveries.&apos; Existing food contracts areexecuted partially or not at all; the contract with the Serbs, already a heavy drain on Austrian finance, is at the moment completely stopped, the Serbs wishing to imposean exportation tax of 40 per cent. Food furnished by contract with the Argentine anden route from Rotterdam is momentarily held by the Germans at Mannheim.The Sub-Commission are unanimously of the opinion that, in accordance with thespirit of Article 181 of the Peace Treaty, 30,000 tons of foodstuffs, at the least, shouldbe instantly provided for Austria. This quantity will constitute a slight insurance against the disorder and anarchy which must be anticipated if a city of nearly3,000,000 inhabitants is constantly threatened with the lack of even the bare minimalrations.2. Need of Raw Materials.At the request of the Sub-Commission the Austrian Government submitted astatement of their minimal requirements, calculated on a basis pro rata with theirminimal requirements of coal. (See Annex A.) The quantities asked for on thewhole, appear justified. No estimate can be given in this report as to the approximatecost of these raw materials, but the Austrian Minister of Commerce stated that, in hisopinion, credits to the extent of 40,000,000 dollars would be sufficient to start industries on a basis proportionate to the minimal amount of coal that could reasonably beexpected.   The Sub-Commission is inclined to think, after hearing the opinions of
leading bankers and manufacturers of Vienna, that if the minimal coal for industrial&apos;purposes were forthcoming, the credits to the extent of 40,000,000 dollars would besufficient to start with, and that such credits for raw materials could be obtained by direct negotiations with foreign markets, and through private Austrian capital,providing the Austrian Government were in a position to assure the people of enoughcoal and food for human existence.3. Need of Coal.The bare minimal requirements of Austria for domestic and industrial usesappear to be in the neighbourhood of 730,000 tons per month. If all the existingcoal contracts between Austria and the neighbouring States Avere fulfilled there would still remain a monthly deficit of, roughly, 200,000 tons. As a matter of fact, duringthe month of September, Austria&apos;s total coal supply amounted only to 378,500 tons,mainly owing to the failure of neighbouring States to live up to their contracts. It isalso due to the latter circumstance that it has been found impossible to provide withany regularity the meagre ration of 7 kilos. say, 15 lb. of coal per week for eachfamily in Vienna, where the use of gas and electricity is now far more stringentlyrestricted than it was in London at any time during the war. The consequentsuffering, now that the first snow has come, is intense. It is almost inconceivable tothink that as the cold becomes more acute the population of Vienna will continue tomaintain their present helpless apathy, or that they are likely to exhibit the hardihoodnecessary to withstand the ordeal of semi-starvation combined with the misery of having no coal for warmth or cooking.In order to provide the minimal coal requirements to preserve life and restartindustry an amount of 200,000 tons of coal per month in addition to the existing contracts should he arranged for Austria. For this purpose a credit would be neededof, approximately, 45,000,000 dollars. In order to facilitate&apos; the enforcement of&apos; thecoal contract between Austria and the neighbouring States, in accordance with theterms of the Peace Treaty, it would seem advisable that the Mahrisch Ostrau CoalSub-Commission should become a Sub-Commission of the Vienna Reparation Sub-Commission. This is in accordance-with the views expressed by the Chairman of theMarisch Ostrau Sub-Commission.Wood for fuel is also fairly strictly rationed, but the shortage of horses and other methods of transport makes it almost impossible for even the richest classes in Viennato obtain wood. The Austrian Government have created a special department to handle the distribution of wood in order to alleviate suffering caused through want ofcoal, and they have been urged by the Sub-Commission to redouble their efforts in thisdirection. The Austrian Government state they will probably be compelled to closeall the schools in Vienna for want of coal or wood.During the first week of the Sub-Commission&apos;s sittings, five food trains fromTrieste were held up on the Austrian frontier through lack of coal to enable them tobring supplies to Vienna. During September the Austrian railways obtained only65 per cent, of the coal they are allowed, which in itself is only 75 per cent, of their normal requirements.4. Development of the Greatest Amount of Production.The Sub-Commission feel that this cannot be dealt with even cursorily in an interim report. They have, however, had an opportunity of impressing on all theLandeshauptmann (Provincial Governor) assembled at a meeting specially called bythe Sub-Commission, the vital importance of removing all trade and other restrictionsas between the provinces in Austria itself. The tendency of the provinces to erecteconomic barriers, and especially their indisposition to assist Vienna, has undoubtedlycontributed to the present crisis, and must seriously retard development. It must notbe implied, however, that in the solution of this difficulty lies the solution of the wholesupply problem. Complete free trade as between the provinces and Vienna would notappreciably alter the figures of the immediate requirements as herein setfortb, althoughit undoubtedly would tend to quicken reconstruction. Under this heading it shouldbe stated that the Austrian Minister of Agriculture estimated that their minimalrequirements of phosphate and manure for agricultural purposes and to minimise food imports next year would involve an expenditure, during the present cereal year, of about,000,000 dollars. Experts estimate that with an expenditure of 8,000,000 dollars forchemical manures necessary to improve agriculture an increase of 26,000 trucks ofcorn could be expected next year. At the present rate of exchange this would represent a value of 1,300,000,000 kronen.[1445] . B 2
5, Facilitation of Transport and Guarantee of Delivery of Supplies from Countries,Bordering on Austria,The Sub-Commission are in agreement in principle with the preliminary report ^of the Commission for the partition of the rolling-stock of the former Austro-HungarianEmpire, as communicated to them by Sir Francis Dent, and have impressed upon the.Austrian Government the importance of providing coal for their railways even at the sacrifice of all other considerations. The Austrian Minister of Railways has informed the Sub-Commission that he has no ground for complaint as to the proportion of coal which he is receiving for the railways.-In view of the disorganised state of the railways in Austria and in the neighbouringStates, the Sub-Commission recommend that they, or their successors, should beempowered to constitute a Railway Section which would act as a traffic pool for the danube Basin, the neighbouring States of Austria to be represented on such a Section,and the Section to have power to hire, uniform and arm such numbers of railwaygendarmerie as may be necessary to enforce the free and unimpeded movement of alltrains. Without some such organisation and without some semblance of power behind it, the interchange of supplies necessary. to the bare existence of the population wouldappear to be impossible. Under present conditions the return of any waggon, once ithas crossed the frontier, to the State from which it started, is always extremely proble-matica]. Under these chaotic circumstances there can be no certainty of food or coal supplies. It would probably also be desirable for the Danube River Inter-allied commission to act similarly as a Section of the Reparation Sub-Commission.6. Payment by Austria.It is impossible to consider the immediate provision of finance for food and coal for Austria without at the same time contemplating a plan for the complete reorganisa-tion of Austria&apos;s financial and economic system. The one is the complement of theother, the second being the natural and necessary corollary of the first.The Sub-Commission are therefore of the opinion, in order to obtain for Allied,interests and Austria the utmost benefits, that there should be a long-term floating loanwhich should be dependent only upon revenue. If this policy were adopted animmediate advantage would be gained by the credits obtained, and at the conclusion of;any period the assets of Austria would remain intact and available for the developmentof the country itself. If a fixed loan, redeemable by the sale of capital assets, were substituted for a floating loan, Austria, at the redemption period, would be altogetherwithout external credits. The main issue is that the Sub-Commission agree thatAnstria&apos;s existing credits should be improved by means of the extension of her liabilitiesby new credits on the lines of the floating loan, since credits at present existing are insufficient to construct economic stability.If, for instance, the assets of a country were represented by 5 and its liabilities by12, in the first case (diminution of assets) a ratio of 3 to 12 would be much less favourable to the renewal of economic activity than the ratio obtained in the secondhypothesis (increase of liabilities) 5 to 14.In accordance with the terms of the letter of the 30th May, 19.19, from the Austrian,Delegates, the Austrian Government have submitted a first list of foreign securitiesamounting to 84,000,000 fr., to be applied to the 48,000,000 dollars food loan. TheMinister of Finance estimates the total value of the foreign securities at 300,000,000 fr.Their collection of gold towards the same purpose has amounted to 1,200,000 fr.The Sub-Commission of the Reparations Commission consider that a sum of100,000,000 dollars is necessary for Austria for the provision of food supplies and coal to cover a period of six months. The expenditure, if required, to he under the super-vision of the Sub-Commission of the Reparations Commission, or the Austrian Sectionof the Reparations Commission when appointed. This amount would leave a marginfor the eventual purchase of fertilisers, indispensable to the revival of agriculture, andfor the purchase of such raw materials as certain industries might not be able topurchase.The Sub-Commiasion propose that a solution of the problem might be found inthe issue of a long-term floating loan for 100,000,000 dollars, and that this loan shouldbe consolidated with the 48,000,000 dollars (approximately) advanced to Austria for thepurchase of foodstuffs since the Armistice by Great Britain, France, and Italy. The ^arrangements for the guarantees of the interest and amortisation on such consolidatedloan should be those already pledged to the Allies in connection with the48,000,000- dollar loan, as determined in the letter from the Austrian. Delegates ofthe 30th May, 1919 (Annex (B)), as well as revenues from existing monopolies or
monopolies to be created. The tobacco monopoly, for instance, provides one of themost valuable resources of the Austrian Governments current Budget, and this despite the existing lack of raw materials. The revenue of the tobacco monopoly can probablybe increased by adopting such methods as &quot; Systeme des Banderelles.&quot; Othermonopolies might also be created, for instance, petroleum, alcohol, matches, Danubeshipping, and, in case of necessity, electric lighting. . :.In addition to these guarantees and securities for the interest and amortisationof the consolidated loan of 150,000,000 dollars, it might also be desirable to take overAustria&apos;s Customs revenues and the receipts of railways. At the present moment,in view of the desperate situation, the Austrian Government would be disposed to surrender these in addition to those guarantees already ceded. The Sub-Commissionconsider that the action outlined above would be in accordance with the letter andspirit of Article 181 of the Peace Treaty.In view of existing conditions, the Sub-Commission propose that a special Inter-Allied Commission should be constituted under the Austrian Section of the reparations commission for the purpose of administrating the revenues given as security for the consolidated loan of 150,000,000 dollars.In order to ensure any efficiency of reconstruction it is essential that at theexpiration of the period covered by the above loan (six months), or earlier if possible,a definite plan of financial reconstruction should come into force. The financialposition of Austria, as estimated by documents submitted to the Sub-Commission bythe Austrian Government, will be found as Annex (C). Several proposals as. to financial reorganisation have been placed before the Sub-Commission, notably, theprinciple of two currencies by means of an issuing bank, which is approved by theMinister of Finance, and also a proposal of a large international loan on long terms,with yearly redemptions. The Sub-Commission ask for the immediate appointmentof an Inter-Allied Banking Commission at Vienna under the Sub-Commission of the reparations Commission to study and devise a definite plan of financial reconstruction.Recapitulation of Conclusions reached by the Sub-Commission.1. The provision ;of 30,000 tons of food immediately.2. The provision of an additional 200,000 tons per month of coal.3.

Payment of the gold and silver money belonging to persons physical and moral of Austro-German nationality, and which money will be requisitioned tothis effect according to the terms of a law that will be submitted to theapproval of the Parliament; it is understood that this disposition doesnot apply to the gold and silver money of the Austro-Hungarian Bank.2. Delivery of the &quot;movables-values&quot; abroad, belonging to citizens of GermanAustria (and indicated in a list which will be established by the Govern-ments givers of credit), after requisition of said values in conformity withthe terms of the law that will be presented to the Parliament by theGerman-Austrian Government.3. Transfer to the Governments givers of credit of the &quot; creances-sur 1&apos;etranger&quot;(amounts due to German Austria for the sales of timber which come fromthe forests belonging to the State or to public or private persons; meanwhile,a mortgage will be established on the forests belonging to the samepersons, forests having an area superior to 500 hectares, with the reservation of the only servitudes or exploitation burdens already existingat the same date.Will be excepted, the forests belonging to citizens of the countriesgivers of credit before the 15th May.4. Transfer of the net product of exploitation by the State of the salines situatedon German-Austrian territory and establishment on said salines, on the factories and all the installations depending on them, of a first mortgage,after reimbursement or provision for the reimbursement of the hypothecaryclaims (&quot; creances&quot;) already existing.
5. For a part of the credit, a security to be purveyed by the city of Vienna. The&quot;&apos; Government will use all its influence so that the attribution of the netrevenues of the built or non-built immovables, and of the industrialexploitations belonging to the city of Vienna and to other towns of GermanAustria having a population superior to 50,000 inhabitants, and theestablishment of a mortgage on said properties be granted.Communication ,will be made by the German-Austrian Government as soon aspossible, at any rate before the end of the month of June 1919, of the decision takenby the German-Austrian Parliament about the subjects mentioned under paragraphs1 to 4, inclusive.The Governments givers of credit will, after having heard the financial experts ofthe German-Austrian Government, let know to said Government the revenues andsecurities claimed by them in the above list for the financial cover of the alimentarycredits.A special agreement will fix the conditions of payment or delivery of the loan, aswell as the conditions of establishment of the securities claimed by them. TheGovernment of German-Austria pledges itself to proceed, at its expense, in good anddue form, to the accomplishment of all the formalities necessary to this effect.It is understood that the securities thus transferred will be liberated, and that themortgages thus constituted will be paid off according to the partial reimbursementseffected by the German-Austrian Government on account to the payment of the creditsfor foodstuffs which are granted to her.The Government of German-Austria declares that it destines; by privilege, all itsrevenues, generally whatever (at the time and the place that will be fixed), to the liberation of the foodstuffs credits Avhich are granted to her; meanwhile, it will be proceeded to the determination of the means of payment and of the securities, as wellas the juridical establishment of said securities and mortgages.We suppose that the amount of the pledges will be fixed in relation with theamount of the credits, the value of the pledges being determined either by objectiverules (for instance, for the gold, by the fineness and the weight; for the securities, bythe value of the Stock Exchange, deduction made of the usual margin for the securitiesin question), or by an evaluation established by a Mixt Commission, for instance, forthe forests.The matter in question would, therefore, be to determine the pledges sufficient to recover the foodstuffs credit of 45,000,000 dollars granted up to now. Beyond theamount of this credit, it will be necessary to obtain supplementary credits for therevictualling of our country. The cover of these credits would have to be made bymeans of the one or the other.pledges above enumerated. \It being our intention to abandon as quickly as possible, the system of the food*stuffs credits, it is absolutely necessary to put our factories into full working order,which will require the purchase of raw materials abroad, purchase which can only bemade when the Governments of the Entente will have determined their choice on the list of the pledges, which contains practically all our realisable assets.Moreover, we consider it necessary that the choice of the Governments incline tothose pledges which, by their nature, can be less easily used for other transactions,i.e., to the pledges indicated above under 3, 4, and 5, and that those elements ofpledges which the most easily permit us the attainment of other credits, be left to us.It would also be desirable that the contract relative to the pledges provides for asubstitution faculty, in accordance with the Governments givers of credits, in view ofredeeming certain elements necessary for the obtainment of private credit, and toreplace these elements by other pledges that are considered sufficient by the Govern -ments of the Entente.We finally suppose that the States givers of credit will, in realising the above-indicated pledges, avoid any measures that might alter the already very bad monetarysituation of German-Austria.Believe us, &amp;c.To the President of the Supreme Economic Council, ... ,Congress of Peace, Paris.
Annex (C.) .   .Property in the Austrian Republic belonging to the State.The property of the Austrian State consists of: T. Industrial concerns owned by the State.IT. Government buildings.III. Property of the former Emperor and, his family.In the former Austrian Empire the property owned by the State has never beenvalued. Though there existed an inventory of -all possessions and holdings, their value in cash never has been estimated. But, even in case this had been done, thefigures could not be taken as a proper basis, in view of the devaluation of the currency.Also a comparison with similar properties belonging to private persons is of no use, asthe Government buildings (for instance, court buildings) lose their value as soon astbey are no more used for their original purpose but for private purposes.I. Industrial Concerns owned by the State.These are the State railways, the tobacco and salt monopoly, the telegraphs andtelephones, the forests and mines.1. State Railways.About 5,000 kilom. of railways are State property (a great part of the Austrianrailways, for instance, the Southern railway, is private property). The investmentvalue of the former Austrian State railways was estimated before the collapse of theEmpire at 6,400,000,000 kronen. This sum does not represent the present value, butthe total of the expenditures made on building and acquiring the State railways informer Austria in a period of about 80 years.If this value is divided in proportion to the number of kilometres of the linesremaining within the Austrian Republic, the invested capital may be estimated at about 1,600,000,000 kronen. The actual value is considerably higher, but exactfigures cannot be given. It is not possible to give information concerning the rolling stock, as the repartition between the national States has not yet taken place. Atpresent the railway cars are actually common property.In the Budget 1919-20 are estimated-The year&apos;s receipts at 500,000,000 kronen.The years expenditure incurred in operating the lines at 943,000,000 kronen.The deficit at 353,000,000 kronen.Since the drawing up of this Budget the Government was compelled to raise thewages, besides the increasing coal prices caused more expenses, so that the actualdeficit will be considerably larger. In this deficit is not included the expenditure forthe payment of interests on the invested capital, as this forms part of the general public debt.2. The Tobacco Monopoly.The assets of the tobacco monopoly consists of : (a.) Eleven factories, machinery, inventory, and(6.) Stocks.From estimates, taken before the war, the value at (a) can be fixed at23,000,000 kronen. The stored up tobacco amounts to 6,000,000 kilog., worth about30,000,000 Dutch guilders.In the Budget of 1919-20 are estimated The receipts at 328,000,000 kronen.The expenses at 117,000,000 kronen.The profit at 210,000,000 kronen.The expenses, mentioned above, will actually be considered larger on account ofthe increase of the costs, especially of wages. On the other hand, an increase of thereceipts is planned for the next future by raising the prices of the products.
3. Salt Monopoly.The salt monopoly comprises the output of salt mines. The salt is gained by-conducting water into salt mines ; this water, after being saturated with salt, is boiled ;and the pure salt remains after the evaporation of this water. The total productionin the year 1917-18 amounted to about 150,000 tons. This production could increaseif the salt works had sufficient coal.In the Budget of 1919-20 are estimated The receipts at 47,000,000 kronen..The expenses at 31,000,000 kronen.  .The profit at 16,000,000 kronen.The value of the factories, the machinery, and the inventory is indicated at about83,000,000 kronen. This sum does not comprise the value of the salt in the mountains.4. Pest, Telegraph, Telephone.Post, telegraph, telephone are State monopolies    The assets are buildings,apparatus, nets, and supplies ; the value is estimated at 147,000,000 kronen.According to the Budget of 1919-20 The expenses amount to 365,000,000 kronen.The receipts amount to 200,000,000 kronen.The deficit amount to 165,000,000 kronen.On account of increased wages the deficit will be considerably larger, though arise of tariffs is planned.5. Forests.800,000 hectares from property of the State, 320,000 of which are non-productive.The value of the returns of these forests was estimated in 1910 at 50,000,000kronen.Considering the extraordinary increase of the prices of wood the present value ofthe State forests may be taken with 650,000,000 kronen.In the Budget of 1919-20.are appraised The expenses at 30,000,000 kronen.The receipts at 32,000,000 kronen.The profit at 2,000,000 kronen.6. Mines.Of the former large mining properties of the Austrian Empire only a few smallmines worth about 5,000,000 kronen remained.In the Budget of 1919-20 are appraised The expenses at 12,000,000 kronen.The receipts at 15,000,000 kronen.The profit at 3,000,000 kronen.II. Government Buildings.The Austrian Republic possesses a great number of buildings for the differentadministrative branches (courts, administrative authorities, schools, hospitals, a.s.o.).These buildings have never been valued, and this value cannot be estimated byway of comparison, as they would lose their value as soon as they are used for otherthan administrative purposes.The Austrian Republic possesses, particularly in Vienna, a large quantity of buildings of the former Central Government, which merely will cause expenses, whenthe administrative apparatus will be restricted.III. Property of the former Emperor and his Family.This property consists partly of immovables, partly of movables.1. Immovables.These consist of  .  .(a.) Crown property.(6.) Entailed property of the Imperial Family (Trust Fund).
Grown Property..r It consists of palaces, castles, theatres, museums, gardens, situated partly inVienna, partly outside, also at Salzburg and Innsbruck. It comprises amongst othersthe &quot; Hofburg,&quot; the Imperial stables, the Imperial museums, the opera house, the&quot; JSurgtheater,&quot; the castle of Luxemburg, the castle in the Augarten, and the castle ofSchonbrunn. Most of these places possess huge gardens, such as the park atSchonbrunn and the very spacious &quot; Tiergarten.&quot; It is impossible to tax the valueeven approximately, as objects for comparison don&apos;t exist. Certainly the value mustbe estimated at several millions of dollars. Some castles possess very valuablefurnitures and works of art.(b.) Entailed Property of the Imperial Family (Trust Fund).The entailed property consists of two estates worth 700,000 dollars and150,000 respectively, four houses to let in Vienna worth about 340,000 dollars.2. MovablesThey consist of (a.) Complete collections.(b.) Scattered property places.To the complete collections belong: the Imperial picture gallery, the museums of art, the collection of engravings (Albertina), the Imperial library, the Treasury, andthe Silberkammer. The scattered property serves for decorating and furnishingcastles and palaces.The valuation of these movables meets with some difficulty; it requiresconsiderable time and a large staff of experts. We cannot even give an approximateestimate of the value of the picture gallery and the museums for instances. Recentlya part of the Morgan collections had been sold for 20,000,000 dollars, and yet theentire Morgan collection could naturally not compare with the treasures contained inthe two above-mentioned institutions. We do not want to mention a figure at random,but it surely could be said with great reserve that the picture gallery and themuseums have a value that by far exceeds 80,000,000 dollars. The collection of silvermight be worth 1,000,000 dollars. The Treasury contains the insignia of the crown,worth several million kronen; the very valuable Crown jewels (gems and pearls) arein the possession of the former Emperor and cannot be disposed of. It is notexaggerated if one values the movables at a sum exceeding the amount of200,000,000 dollars.Concerning the complete collections we beg to refer to Article 196 of the peace treaty, which forbids for the next twenty years the selling or scattering of thesecollections, or the disposing of them in any way, unless the States concerned have come to a special agreement.Budget of the Austrian Republic.In the Budget of the Austrian Republic for the fiscal year 1919-20 are estimated The revenues at 2,548,000,000 kronen.The expenses at 6,547,000,000 kronen.The deficit with about 4,000,000,000 kronen.The actual deficit, however, will be by far greater; it can already now be estimatedat 8,000,000,000 to 10,000,000,000 kr., as the prices for foodstuffs are rapidly risingwith the devaluation of the kronen and the constant increase of wage scales not to be avoided. Besides the effects of the Peace Treaty are not taken into consideration atthe above estimates ; this is especially the case as regards the State liabilities, as theAustrian Republic has to take over two-thirds of the debts of the former AustrianState.
