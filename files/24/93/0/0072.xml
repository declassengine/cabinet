Though the general sense of the miners is in favourof nationalisation, in Staffordshire they would prefer a sohemeof joint oontrol, for they dislike the idea of having their work inspeoted by Government offioials.High prioes and laok of houses are still the mostimportant oauses of unrest.   One correspondent points out thatthe Trade Union rules are delaying the work, and that briok-layers in the United States are allowed to lay four times as many brioks in the day as the British brioklayer.The trouble with regard to inoome tax is likely to oometo a head, very soon, ^There is a widespread conviction that a Labour Governmentwill be in power within a few months, and that then all theaspirations of the extremists will be realised.On the whole, working olass opinion is slowly butsteadily inolining towards the Left; violent Bpeeohes arebeooming/
beooming more common and class hatred appears to be growing.It is very difficult for working men to reoonoile the twofaots, that the publio debt eonounts to thousands ofmillions and that there has.never been a time when therehas been so much money in the.country as at present.   IhePress apoounts of the Motor Show and the number of ordersgiven for costly cars are pointed to as a proof thatworking men.are not obtaining their fair share.   It isprobably this more than any other oause that is fosteringthe general attitude of &quot;oa-Canny&quot;,It is probable that no great strike will take place before Christmas.   The long drawn-out strike of the iron-moulders is the most serious faotor at the moment, becauseunless it is soon settled a very large number, of men willbe thrown out of employment.
IMlONALISiiTION OF THE MINB3Ihere has been a lull in nationalisation meetingsduring the week.   Mr. Prank Hodges reoently admitted to anacquaintance that it was difficult to address big audienceswith so little information to give.   One leaders are waiting for an announcement of a reduced prioe of ooal of whiohthey will make the fullest use,$he Trade Union officials in South Wales do not thinkthat a ballot on a strike to enforce nationalisation willbe taken,   &quot;ioiy way,&quot; said one of the leaders, &quot;the nextGovernment is certain to be a Labour one and we will getnationalisation all right then.&quot;   This anticipation of a labour Government seems universal, and the recent handling of the railway strike has done much to prevent the minersfrom building on a strike.   Another Trade Union officialsaid, &quot;Tnere will be no strike here if we are left alone.&quot;The hewers in South Wale3 are not at all satisfied thatthey would benefit by ohange of ownership, although theminers as a whole,favour nationalisation,... In Staffordshire, my correspondent save the minerswould prefer a soheme of joint control to nationalisation:they do not like the idea of having their worksupezlntended and inspeoted by Government offioials.On the other hand, in Northumberland the miners will. support any polloy that will bring about nationalisation,i  It is estimated that fully 80fc of the miners are infavour of State Control.THE Gfli^E^L STAFF FO^IABOUft    &apos;-t      . . - ... . &apos;The Committee whioh is oonsidering the question ofa General Staff, details of whioh I gave in a previous report/
report, haa now appointed a sub-oommittee to prepare asoheme for th8 creation of a General Staff for the    &quot;  ]L??bour movement.   The Committee consists of:Harry GoslingSwalesE. Bevin-jobert WilliamaArthur HendersonG.D.K. GollPred Brailey   (Seoretary) &apos;CO-OPE-iATIVE SOCIETIES AND TLIJB Ti&amp;DE UNIQN5 &apos; &apos;There is again evidence that the two sectionsinterested in this question, the Trade Unionists andthe ordinary co-operators, are moving, the one quickly,the other slowly.   From several parts of the oountryI am informed that local branches of the AmalgamatedSooiety of Engineers and National Union of .:jailwaymenare placing their funds in the Co-operative Banks.In Woolwich alone the sum of  12,000 is said to havebeen so inveateo.In L?nceshire Trade Union officials are urgingtheir member3 to join the Co-operative Societies, asby so doing they can control the voting of money forpolitioal and other purposes at the quarterly meetings.In the East of London arrangements are being madefor transport and provisions, which embrace the dookaand railways.Butt taie branch of the North StaffordshireMiners1 Federation has arranged with the localCo-operative Society for the supply of food to thevalue of 10s. eaoh per week to men on strike, onoondition that the head of eaoh family becomes a Cq-operator,Mr. G.E. Waterson, Co-operative M.P. for Kettering,has/
has addressed large meetings at Leeds and Hudderafield,at which he urged the necessity for the Co-operative society to define its political attitude on the sideof Labour.Co-operators who are not Trade Unionists aregradually awakening to the assault on their position -more especially as tlieir dividends are involved.   they say that if the praotice of voting money for differentpurposes whioh do not benefit them were stopped, theywould receive the pre-war 3s. In the   as against thepresent 2s.G30WTH OF FBBL1NG AGAIKST TAB QOVS^mVSI have alluded to the general belief that a labour Government will shortly be returned to power.i?o doubt the high prices and the housing difficulties have much to do with the discontent among working men,who regard t^e Government as a patron of trusts andprofiteers.   Jiy Newcastle correspondent says there isa very marked feeling against the present coalition government, which is generally believed to have had its day.The outcry against high prices 3eems to beincreasing.   People are exasperated with the tribunals and demand that the Government should deal with thelarge trusts.   An example of this feeling is providedby a protest meeting whim, it is reported, will beheld outside St. Andrew13 -Jail, Glasgow, on November20th, when the shareholders of Messrs. Coats&apos; are meeting/
m   4 ^meeting inside.   The protest meeting will condemn theincrease in the prioe of thread and will call upon theGovernment to nationalise the thread,factories, utilising the profits and reserves for the. erection of houses forthe people.there is. a curious movement on. foot in several partsof the country.&apos; workers, instecd of,aiming...at inoreaaedwages, are demanding a decrease in the cost of living.The best illustration is perhaps provided, by the Liscardbranch of the Amalgamated Sooiety of Carpenters andJoiners, which ia about to distribute to Trade Unionistsa oiroular urging joint action to force the Governmentimmediately to reduce tre cost of living,   It willpoint out that increments in wages are useless as theyare invariably aooomprnied by increased prioes.   SheBranch members therefore are in favour of the reductionof all scales of wages to 20$ above the level of the wages in August, 1914-, provided that no,adult worker receivesleas than  2 per week; the Government is to fix the prioesof all food, clothing and. household effects at what theywere in August 1914.   As an alternative, they resolve thatworkers throughout. t;e country should oease work untilprices are reduced.THE HOUSING QUESTIONTnere is no improvement to report in regard to housingmatters.   My correspondents describe conditions aa&quot;scandalous&quot; and *aouteM, and agree t&apos;.iat housing is seoondonly to profiteering as a oauae of unrest.It might be well to oall public attention to t.ie faotthat in America a bricklayer lays, four, times as manybricka in the day as is allowed, under the English Trade *Union .-iegulatione.   If the Trade Union were to modify itsRegulations/
rtegulationa in order to benefit its houaelesa fellowworkers the period of&apos;hduse^bullding might be greatly-shortened.  ^       : w: &apos;&apos;xY-TH3 cJiTEEPLOYMMT DOttATIQtfThehOjie -that t&apos;ve donation would be extended lingereduntil the&apos; last&apos;moment, and the -effect :6f the&apos; cessationcannot yet - be estimated.   l&amp; Liverpool correspondentdraws a -rat&apos;-er gloomy-picture of what will happen, butit is too-eerfy yet-:Sto say how&apos; much hardship and unrestwill be entailedv   The men in the Liverpool area arestating openly that they will not starve while -the   .EEovemment allows others to make huge profits.THE ESTIMATION OF IABQTJ.H, l^M)Sft?; l-I have received the following report of a speeohmade by--&quot;Mr.-   *flV*&apos;fe6&apos;3ft8, ;&apos;M.P., ;at the recent apeoiair General&apos;Tieeting of Delegates of the National Union of-    ^i^ailwaymeh: :&apos; &quot;You have an instanoe of potency of foroe^ehi^d&apos;a representative in the House of Common? in thecase qf George Barnes.

Therefore their ui/heranoea become valueless.&quot;In this connection, my correspondent adxla:.. . &quot;Shis(view) is quite oorrect .....

Poverty could hot be elimiiaated and industries could not be worked effioiently until theygot rid of those who were parasites on industry.   an industrial revolution would mean that &quot;Algernon andtClaude&quot; would havfe to do their six days&apos; work the sameas other people.;tobert Williams, seoretary of the TransportWorkers&apos;

LONDON council with the Bupport of the Central Counties, Essex, 3outhem,South Eastern and South Western Distriot %Counoils.Riture !Con trol of the ftaiIways.&quot;The Important and pressing question of the futureownerahip, oontrol and management of the railways, makeait imperative that we, as railway workers?, should veryoarefully consider the matter with a view to a definite policy being adopted.whilst we have repeatedly asked for equal representa-tion, both national and local, upon the management of therailways, my Counoil is of the opinion that our members have only a very hazy idea of what they aotually require.Equal representation on Boards of rianagement, whether under nationalisation or private enterprise, is not asufficient guarantee thait our railways will be run in thebeat interests of the railway workers or of the oommunitygenerally.. jteoent events in connection with the Coal Commissionclearly indicate that vested interests are not going togive up their hold on the vital industries of this oountrywithout a straggle.   Recognising that a struggle is inevitable, it is most essential that we thoroughlyunderstand what we want and how to get it.With a view to eduoating our members and bringing them into line with .the growing demand for the democraticcontrol of industry, a conference will be held in theGreat Hall, Memorial He 11, Saturday, Deoember 13th, at p.m.   Speakers C.T. Cramp, G.D.H. Cole, W.W. Craik,and W. Hellor,&quot;Evidenoe is aooumulatlng that the railwcymen are movingtowarda a demand for nationalisation and they are undoubtedlyin a reative state of mind.PEELING- IN THE AflkYMy Leeda correaponcent has been much impressed by the conversation of soldiera on leave from the jtfiine whentravelling by train.   TSiey oomplain of the starvation ofwpmen and children, aaying &quot;We have knooked out Pritz buthia women and children a^e just like out own and why should we allow them to starve.&quot;   One soldier told the passengershow/
how he had stolen stores of bully beef and milk anddistributed it to German ohildren.   Isy Correspondenthas heard similar conversations in publio housesfrequented by demobilized men or soldiers on leave.In this connection it should be noted that adefinite effort to undermine the loyalty of His Majesty&apos;forces is contemplated by certain extremist leaders.A case in pojnt was a meeting of the Cheltenham labourParty on November l6th, when the Station master Chandlerand another speaker urged the workers to go amongst thesoldiers, ex-soldiers and police and persuade them tojoin labour in the class war.FEELING AMONGST EX-3S^VICE ftjENThere is little change in the attitude of ex-Service men.   !Ihe movement towards amalgamation of thevarious organisations appears to be making slow progress.On November 11th the Exeoutive Committee of the BoltonBranoh of the National Federation pasj*ed a resolution to the effect that the Government should compelemployers to substitute ex-Service men for those who did not serve during the war at &quot;desk, bench or maohine.MTHE ELECTRICAL T,^ADtiid UNION ANb CINEMArfEie Eleotrioal Trades Union, which is controlled byextremists, is alive to the power of the film for propaganda purposes.   It is very distrustful of theCinema Operating Schools which are being establised for ex-soldiers, and is refusing admission to the unionof any man so trained.   Its excuse is that it has many,unemployed/.....-i..&apos;-&apos;...... .      i..
unemployed members and oannot aooept half trained pupilsfrom the schools, but its real motive is to be in a.. ..position to call out oiriema operators if they are. employed on anti-Class War propaganda..THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PAriflY. This.Party reports an increase in membership, and itis, reported that it has many sympathisers who do not joinfor,fear of victimisation in their employment.The leaders regard their Municipal successes as onlya step to the next Parliamentary Eleotion, and they arealready preparing the ground.LEEDSIn my last.report I drew attention to the unrest inthis area.   During the past week there has been an influx of extremists,   rf. Wallhead, J.W. Kneeshaw, H.N. Brailsford,.&amp;.L. Outhwaite, CP. Trevelyan, H.J. Stenning, John McLeanand George Ebury have all spoken in.Yorkshire during theweek.   It seems a pity that their false teaohing ofeoonomics and their revolutionary utterances cannot bemet by oounte^propaganda.SOUTH wales correspondent wjip has been investigating industrial conditions in South Wales, reports that, on the whole,;the district is less unsettled than for some time past -in the words of a mining authority:   &quot;It is quite a longtime since we had so little trouble with the men;( theyhave not been making so much bother about the smallermatters lately.&quot;   (This remark applied to 18 pits.   the extremist/
extremist &quot;element consists mostly of youths who have nothing to lose; they are supported by the IndependentLabour Party whioh is active in this district, but oarrylittle weight with the older men.My correspondent states that the main cause of unrestis Income Tax, whioh means far more to the miners thannationalisation, and will in all probability result in a stoppage,   k ballot on the issue is to be taken immediately.He adds that this is the prinoipal reason for the &quot;oa&apos; canny&quot;polioy; more men are earning the.minimum wage than ever before and they say that they are not going to work allshifts to have the pay of one shift taken from them in Tax.One pit in South Wales has not had a man working more thanthe minimum for the last six weeks.   Complaints of theshortage of railway wagons are general.The progress of the IT.S.A. miners&apos; strike has been closely followed and is likely to have a salutary effect.The Trade Union officials do not like the draytie manner inwhich the strike was handled and are particularly angeredby the U..S. leader&apos;s phrase, &quot;We are iifcierioans and will notfight the Government.&quot;   The general impression in the SouthWales ooalfield is that the miners were thoroughly beaten.Premium bonds are much disoussod and. would apparentlybe very popu3.ar.The Dockers in this area are becoming very restlessregarding the claim for l6s. per day.   This fact isimportant, as is their &quot;ca&apos; canny&quot; polioy, of whioh mycorrespondent gives the following example, relating to coal tipping at Cardiff:.... . .   -     before/
Before the war, a 2,000 tone (dead weight) vessel wasregularly loaded under four hydraulic or steam tips in 1 hourand 40 minutes, and unloaded in 11/12 hours.   At present, whenelectrio improvements have increased the speed of the machines12/14^, the same weight vessels are not being loaded under11 hours.   Ihe unloading (under old maohine speed) takes atleast 24 hours.The same number of men are employed and the onlyreason for the reduoed rate is apparently the &quot;limitation of output&quot; polioy, as they work to a fixed number of &quot;lifts&quot;per hour and will not exoeed the number, regardless of whatthe machine oan do.Wages in 1914 were about 5s. 6d. per man per day of10 hours and a full night (7 p.m, to 5 a.m.) was worked, ifneeded.   Wages now are about 12s. 4d. per man per day of8 hours (aotual working time is only about 7 hours 15 minutes)and a short night (9 p.m. to 5 a.m.) is worked,  f the men will do it at all.About 60% of the coal loaded to vessels in the UnitedKingdom is handled at this port.Wim HARDY   .A British subject named George Hardy, aged 35* wnoemigrated to Canada in 1906 and is now out of prison on bail,is at present conducting a oampaign on behalf of theIndustrial Workers of the World who are imprisoned in theUnited States for sedition and other crimes.   Hardy&apos;s appealwill be heard next April, when he will probably be deportedfrom the United States.   On his arrival last month he got into touch with the &quot;Solidarity&quot; group, with the object ofobtaining engagements for lectures.   After completing hisEnglish tour he proposes to visit Australia.   The &quot;Herald&quot;,the/
the &quot;Dreadnou^it&quot;, the &quot;Worker&quot; and &quot;Solidarity&quot; have alltaken up his cause, and he has the support of Tom Mann,Arthur MoManus, D. carmichael and C.T. Cramp.   He is atpresent in South Wales, where he is oolleoting funds and isreoeiving some support from the Miners&apos; Federation.   Oneof his objects is to reoonoile the British Workers withthe Industrial workers of the World.   At the monthlymeeting of the miners&apos; delegates in Pontypridd and ffaonddaa resolution was passed protesting against the tyrannyof American capitalists towards progressive workers in therecent strike.   I am informed that he is floing a very greatdeal of harm in South Wales, chiefly as a rallying point for the extremist elements.MB. CHA3LS3 Tx(EVELYAHOn November 4th Mr, Trevelyan wrote a letter toMr. Phillips Prioe in Berlin whioh is worth quoting as an example of diseased self-esteem and wrong thinking.   Hebegins by saying that he ia about to have a good dinner.but that his mind is always haunted by the starving,ooalless cities.&quot;I should be hating myself exoept that I&quot;deliberately think that I am doing the most I oan&quot;do to bring humanity and deoenoy baok to the&quot;world .........Already I am becoming the leading&quot;spokesman for Labour and Socialism on the Tyne.....&quot;Whether or not I go to the next eleotion with real&quot;hope or not depends entirely on whether the Mosoow&quot;Government holds out.......... What line will the&quot;olass struggle take in England?  I will first&quot;attempt what I am playing for - a parliamentary&quot;revolution without oompromise.   If that fails it&quot;will attempt a revolution by violence. ...........&quot;I shall die a landlord unless the reactionaries&quot;oonfiBoate my land and outlaw me.   If .jussia holds&quot;out I hope to die an old age pensioner on a farm&quot;near Cambo, whioh Bauline jias leased off the State.&quot;......... In this world here I am more useful&quot;living in the conditions of my olass but a traitor&apos;&quot;to it, and working to break its power from the  .advantage/
&quot;advantage whioh I have......... To put it another&quot;way, I believe I oan slate Capitalism and&quot;Landlordism more, not less effectively beoause I&quot;speak as a capitalist and a landlord,   At this stage&quot;in our mentality many a Britisher is still snob*enough to listen to a man with a position, and will&quot;take from him straight talking whioh he won&apos;t take&quot;from a working engineer.. ........All the children&quot;and Molly are very well.   They take to Faoifism&quot;quite naturally.   We sing the &quot;.ted Flag&quot; every&quot;Sunday.   George has insisted.on his form taking&quot;in the &quot;Herald&quot;, and is Labour leader of the Lower&quot;School, so he is.starting all right.&quot;Mr, Trevelyan talks of going to Switzerland for thenext International, and making his way,on to Germany.   he also speaks of his eldest son as follows,:&quot;He ought to marry an Amerioan railroad king&apos;s&quot;daughter to make up for you.&quot;   (Mr. Prioe appearsreoently to have, married a German woman of ratherhumble origin).       &apos;Kr. Trevelyan spoke to an audience&apos; of about 300 atan Independent Labour Party meeting in Victoria Hall,Saltaire, and, after aoousing the Government of intending to bring down the workers to the pre-war level of wages&quot; and conditions, warmly eulogised the Soviets in Hussiafor their admirable system of eduoation and treatment ofchildren.THE IxlISH MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND- There has been a burst of aotivity on the part of irish Societies .and their supporters in Britain f whiohculminated in the Albert Hall meeting on November 15th.It seems possible that Ireland will follow ivussia as arallying point.for the extremists.   There are indications,. not yet amounting to evidenoe, that British Labour isentering into closer relationship with Sinn Fein.Glasgow has always been a centre of Sinn Feinaotivity and I am informed :that the Clyde Workers&apos;Committee/
Committee are negotiating for a visit from prominent Irishextremists.The Irish Self-Determination League has held meetings:in London, St. Helens and kanohester; Irish men and women in the last named oily have pledged themselves to raise 10,000 for,the Republican Loan.inland , &quot;     ;&quot;There is no appreciable change in the state of publiofeeling in the Provinoes,   The polioe reports show thatthe greater part of the oountry was outwardly quiet with onlya few Isolated ooourrenoes whioh show the disloyalty beneaththe surface, but the condition of Munster generally remainsunsatisfaotory.With the Irish Volunteer movement an inner circle ofdesperadoes seems to have been formed, who are determined to stick at nothing to oreate a state cf chaos and anarohy.These men appear to plan all raids and assassinations,   Sheybelong to the ordinary Irish Volunteer organisation, but areat present working more as a seoret sooiety on the old lines.The name of the leader is known and he is being oloselywatched,Sinn Fein is making no progress and appears to have nothing definite in hand at present beyond attempts to floatthe Republican Loan and preparations for the Local GovernmentBleotions in January next,$ie leaders are anxious, it would seem, leBt therepeated outrages, especially the murders of polioe, may havean adverse effeot at the January eleotions and a seoretoiroular is believed to have been sent to Executives with aview to ascertaining to what extent the people oonneot theseoutrages/
outrages with Sinn Fein and what effeot it is likely tohave on the voting. iThe National Executive of the Trades Council has nowfully determined to contest these Local Government Eleotionsand has also sent round a oiroular dated November 1stordering that only those who are nominated and financed bylabourlegitimate/bodies are to be known as Labour candidates and each one so nominated is to sign a Labour pledge.In the Irish jtiepublioan movement a good deal of work isbeing oarried on to interest English advanced Labour leaders.For example, from information that oan be relied on it isknown that efforts are being made to get Hiilip Snowden tocome into the movement.   The attempt to do so has been workedthrough hi s wife.&quot;The Watchword of Labour&quot; prints a violent artiole onthe Government&apos;s intention to introduoe Home .aile.   Thefollowing extract shows the tone adopted:-&quot;The English Press tells us that this Long and Shorttabortion is to be imposed upon Ireland by foroe.   We don&apos;twant to threaten but we are on safe ground when we say thatif England makes an attempt by foroe to give the Irisnpeoplewhat they do not want, there will be red and bloody war in1/eland.&quot;The paper reiterates the demand for an independentIrish Jtepublio and looks to English Labour and to -Americafor help.
