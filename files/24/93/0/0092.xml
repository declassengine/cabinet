CAB^^v     J[j?i3 Document is the Property of   A  VAGRI CULTURAL LABOURERS. 327emorandum for the Cabinet by the Right Hon;Walter H* Long, M.P.I understand that there is pressure in some quarters to r***oonsider the decision arrived at a short time ago in regard to agricultural labourers; and thatthe Secretary for Scotland urges their inclusion in theMinister of Labour&apos;s Bill.I hope that the Cabinet will adhere to their previous decision.   Agriculture is prosperous at present;but the farming community, large and small, is profoundlyanxious about .the labour question - and any further inter-ferenoe with the oonditions of labour in the agriculturalcommunity would, I am convinced, cause something littleshort of disaster, and must result in a very great reductionof the productive power of the land.I venture therefore to urge that the decision should be maintained,WeHtL.21;11:1Q.
