F0INS3, GAL&apos;:.&quot;AT, BLACKSOD BAY,LOUGH S-lLiYox x x x x x x xThe present orders are to this effectQuite truetauite true,It is characteristicof the .eocle theyare al .uyf against the/government or Policeuntil they areassailed then theyapneal to ,Govt. and police lor help;-.Yes. I have heardthis often. Th...agitators and theiriests were bothagainst it anddreaded it.I have alreadywritten in! the same sense to My lords commissioners of theAdmiralty.5,-,    The closing down of some local .7/1 Stationsleanir the Coastguard Stations only connectedby easily cut telephone wire has made coastwatching a frail organisation and has isolatedthe Coastguard Stations should there be localdisaffection.Coastguards should not have firearms (exceptstored at a base) they are merely a temrtationto Sinn Fein; they are of no real use to theCoastguard service&apos; and might easily lead toperfectly useless bloodshed.6.    The seaport villages ire mostly reportedto have the greater percentage of their&quot;inhabitants loyal; the presence of vessels ofwar does much &apos;to steady all inhabitants and theinfluence of these vessels extends inlsnd..estsons7,    There are hereditary Royal Navalfamilies in the Coast villages on theCoast still existing and s-ndinr theirinto the Wavy, but since the reserve shi^s were taken away this has decreased somewhat.8.    Recently there was cattle drivinrr atCarrigaholt and a Motor Launch was sent withsoldiers from xdlrush to support the Dolice. . -The drivers of the cattle :;ere Sinn Feiners;the o,-ners of the cattle were Sinn Feiners;but the latter instantly appealed to thepolice gainst the former.9.    The failure to enforce conscriptionseems to have been a source of grief andsadness to the young manhood of&quot;&quot;Ireland, andto have been immediately taken advantage of by the agitators.10,   Anything that has evidence of power has amost calming effect upon the people;   warvessels upon the coast properly stationedand cruising suonort the loyal inhabitants of  hich there are considerable numbers, andgradually teach sense to the others.
11r ^All seem to agree, oinn Feiners andloyalists alike, that if you remove theGovernment :,nd put Irishmen in po-ver, theinstant result rvill be internecine war with-  every marls hand against his neighbour.,    The -people understand and are happy I-f order ismair.it .ined.iillybegs ^as reportedto be loyal and thepeople&apos; to have done! sell during &apos;.* jr.I Consequently Sloopsand T.BcD;s have b-enstationed in moredisturbed districts,but I will see thatllllybegs has more attention.12,   X illy begs, having been&apos;without a vessel ?dwar for three months?&quot;has grossly depreciatedin manners,,    There is now much insolent-loafing on the pier, shouts of nDovn with england&quot; -nd rain ted right across the wall isthe legend &quot;Here&apos;s to the glorious republic,uo :i tli the rebels&quot;.13.  Motor Launches are very suitable for the inland water patrol, from their activity andsmal1 dr angh t&apos; o f m te r.Sheir&quot;motor mechanics are being taken away from them; they are difficult to rununless the engineers are experienced in them.i have jlr adypointed this out.25th October, 1919u
