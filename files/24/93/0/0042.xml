This document is the property of His Britannic MajestyJs government.CABINET.CIVILIAN SUBORDINATES-ROYAL AIR FORCE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.The establishment of civilian subordinates employed at Air Force dep6ts has beenunder progressive reduction for some months past. The programme, as it now stands,provides for a reduction of approximately 2,500 men between 1st November and1st December. The estimate of expenditure for the remainder of the current financialyear has pre-supposed that this reduction and further reductions on a considerable scale will be carried out.That large reductions would be made has for some time past been known generally to the men concerned, but, in the case of a batch of 800 men who were under theprogramme due for discharge from the Milton Depot on Friday, 14th November, strong representations have been made as to the hardship of these discharges and similardischarges at other depdts being carried out, unless fresh employment for the mendischarged were immediately forthcoming.In consequence of these representations I have given orders for the suspension ofthe discharges due to be carried out under the programme, and I propose to give orders to slow down the discharges at the dep6ts in the Royal Air Force.The following table shows (i.) In column A the scheme of reductions hitherto contemplated,(ii.) In column B the scheme of reductions now proposed.(iii.) In column C the additional numbers which will be held under the scheme-now proposed.	A.	B.	C.Civilian subordinates, 1st December..	3,280	5,495	2,215,,           ,,         1 st January ..	2,830	4,945	2.115,,                      1st February..	2,260	4,275	2,015,,           ,,         1st March	1,200	2,295	1,095,,           ,,         1st April	1,200	1,200	The additional cost which will be incurred by making the modification of programme proposed is estimated at 110,000/.On the other hand, as against this extra charge must be set the unemployment donation which would probably have been payable in respect of most of the mendischarged. The total cost to the country of the deferring of the proposed changes istherefore not as great as the extra cost which will fall on Air Force Estimates.There is undoubtedly work at the dep6ts upon which these men could usefully beemployed The voluntary discharge of men during this period will remain unaffected.I would add that the reductions shown under column B as to take place during thenext few months will not be from the large depots, but only from the pay offices andrecord offices and will take place as the work decreases at these offices.In view of the urgency of this matter, I proposejyt issnpi orders on 21st Novemberon the lines of this memorandum unless any member of the Cabinet wishes for a discussion on the subject.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.17th November, 1919. ,(1319/533)   100   11/19   H&amp;S   7710wo
