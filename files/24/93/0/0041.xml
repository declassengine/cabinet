9 bOGUIvIENT IS THE -PROPERTY.. OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST^S GOVERNMENT, j^ 0 A B I N-E......-.....-y THE CONDITION CF AUSTRIA.Copy of. letter from Sir John Bradbury, .Principal BriMsh Delegate on theReparation Commi s a ion I,,     &apos; *&quot; -(See aleC.F-,&apos;10,4.)&quot; &apos;I circulate to the Cabinet a letter whichI have received from the Principal British Delegateon the Reparation Commission.(Intd). A.C.treasury,, S.v;. 1November .17th, 1919.
My dear Chancellor,A repsrt is coming fforward from the organisation committee of the Reparation Commission, through theSupreme Council, to the Governments of ihe Allied andAssociated Powers upon the Austrian question.-It. will be accompanied b? what I have every reasonfor thinking, is a fair statement of the actual position,by the Austrian Sub-Commission of the Organisation Committeewhich has recently been sitting in Vienna.The position in a nutshell is.this, that Austriais faced with almost immediate starvation unless somethingis done.The situation is not one which can be handled bythe Reparation Commission (even if the Austrian Treatywere in force), under its present powers-   The ReparationCommission could certainly allow Austria to apply anyliquid resources at her disposal to the purchase of food, and fuel, releasing such resources from any charge in respect of reparation.   It could also - perhaps more doubtfully4-,authorise Austria to raise a loan on her own credit, pledgingeither her general resources.  :r specific assets, and permit the interest and sinking fund of such a loan to have priorityever Reparation.   But in point of fact neither of theseexpedients will meet the situation.There is a certain amount.cf assets if which thepictures and the tobacco monopoly are perhaps the two bestexamples, for which immediate purchasers could be found, andthe proceeds of which would keep Austria going&apos;for a fewmonths.   The result, however, of the forced sale of these assets would be to loate the country entirely helpless whenthey were gone, and postpone any question of Reparation, oreven Reconstruction; until! the Greek Kalends.The second alternative would be feasible, if a lendercould be found.   But it is very improbable, In view-ofAustria&apos;s present economic plight and gloomy future prospects,that even the postponement &amp;f all Reparation charges to thecharge for the service of such a loan would make the. proposala business propositions.If, then, a loan is to be raised, the lenders must clearly be the Allied and Associated Governments,   and whether these Governments will be either willing or able to make sucha loan is o;bviously a metter for them, and not for theReparation Commission, to decide.The Americans contend that it is the business of theReparation Commission, on the analogy of the receiver inbankruptcy, to husband the assets of the bankrupt estate and obtain working capital by borrowing, giving if necessary to thenew lenders a charge prior to the charges of existing creditors(the Powers entitled to Reparation).This26, rue de Bas3ano,Paris.12th November 1919.
1 Hi1/1This argument would no doubt bo a sound ono if therewor,., a reasonable probability of finding new lend ore on such terms, and thereby effecting a reconstruction out of whichthe original creditors would benifit.     But the prospects of anything of this kind are so remote that, from the purelybusiness point of view, it is quite clear thet prudentcreditor:.; would proceed&quot;immediately to realise such assetsas may be realisable at the best prices obtainable and cuttheir losses.The real question is not whether the advances are desirable in the interests of Reparation, but whether, inview of the responsibilities which the Powers have takenin creating the economic absurdity of tho Austria of to-day,and of the danger to civilisation of allowing the country tobecomo a prey to famine, it is, or is not, necessary on grounds of humanity and statesmanship for thomto providethe assistance necessary to prevent this catastrophe,This is essentially a question for the Governmentsof the Powers themselves, and not for the Reparation Commis-sion, and for this reason tho Organisetion Committee hasdecided, to refer the report of the Austrian Sub-Commissionto the Governments of the Alliea associated Powers, withoutany further observations other than to suggest a plan uionwhich, if the Powers decide to make the advances, the businessmight be administered.This plan is shortly, that the Reparation commission should, with the adsont of the Austrian Government, under-take the control   f the whole of the Austrian revenues andassets, on lines similar to those of the Commission forthe Ottoman Debt, but with even more extensive powers of interference.     This really amounts to tho ReparationCommission undertaking the government of Austria - an arrange-ment which I should bo vory glad to see avoided if possible.At the same time, if the. Powers arc to assist Austria withloans,-a far-reaching scheme of - control.is absolutely essential, if any limit is to be placed on tho liability,or any security, obtained for the advances, and it is probablethat such control could bo organised moro effectively by thoReparation Commission than by the creation of a body .ad hoc.The Vienna Sub-Commission is of opinion that ifforeign credits for food and coal are created to the extentof one hundred million dollars, there is a reasonableprobability that the Austrians may be&quot; able to arrange forthomsolves the. credits necessary for raw materials forreconstructing industry, and that by the time the 100,000,000dollars. Is exhausted, say in six months&apos; time, some sub-atantial progress may have been achieved in the task of reconstruction.     I am by no means satisfied that this isnot an unduly sanguine forecast, and I should n t like tosay that if the 100,000,000 dollars is put up by theAllied and Associated Powers, they will not be confronted with a similar demand at the end of six months.     Furtherthough thie plan is su: ported by tho American representativeshero, they say&apos; quite flatly that America cannot, for legal and political reasons, take any part in the proposed advance,which should &quot;be provided - exclusively by Great Britain,France and ItalyI said quite flatly in reply to this that in thatcose the proposal was n t worth the paper on which it was written, that it would.be difficult for.Great Britain,under
under existing economic conditions, even to take a share in a loan to which America contributed, but that for Great Britain to provide sterling credits, which would be used to some extent at any rate for the purpose of direct purchases in America of supplies for Austria, and to a large extent of finance the American purchases of other suppliers of Austria, appear to me to be quite out of the question, and that so far as I could see, what applied to Great Britain, applied a fortiori to France and Italy.

Mr. Rathbone asked me after the Meeting whether this represented the final view of my Government, as in that case he would like to inform Washington at once that Great Britain absolutely declined to make any advance for Austrian relief except on condition that the United States did the same. I answered that I was satisfied that that was the attitude of the British Government six weeks ago, and that I could see nothing in what had happened during the last six weeks which would lead them to change it, but as the question was beyond my competence, and was now being raised in a somewhat now and very acute form, I should like to refer the matter home before giving a final opinion.

My own view is that our Government should maintain an absolutely adamantine attitude against advances to Austria unless the United States can, and will, take at least an equal part. I am firmly convinced that the economic problems of Central Europe are insoluble by purely European effort, and unless America will take a large share in dealing with them, any efforts made by the European Powers will merely result in a short postponement of the catastrophe, and involving themselves in it.   
is of the power of Great Britain to take a substantial part in them, even if the United States agrees to co-operate. We are both, I think, in agreement that, without the co-operation of the United States the position is hopeless. On the other hand, the political difficulties of the United States coming in, more particularly at the present moment, are most formidable, and probably the most that can be hoped for is some sort of assurance that if advances are now made by the European Allies, the United States will ultimately take over a share of them and even this it may be very difficult to obtain.
