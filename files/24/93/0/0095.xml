This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.IMPERIAL AIR ROUTES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.I circulate to my colleagues a Eeport of the Committee on Civil Aviation, whichI appointed under the Chairmanship of Lord Weir, to advise as to the organization ofImperial Air Routes, and such other matters affecting civil aviation as might bereferred to it.I am in agreement with the recommendations in the present report as to the natureof the assistance to be given by the State to private enterprise in this matter. Itwill be seen that, so far as administrative action is concerned, the Committee&apos;srecommendations are confined for the present to the air route between Egypt andIndia. The organization of that route for service purposes has already received thesanction of the Cabinet and the necessary steps are being taken. I am conferringwith the Postmaster-General as to the conditions on which tenders for a contract for the carriage of mails by civil firms on the route should be invited, and am in communication with the India Office and Foreign Office as to the removal of restrictionson civil aviation in India and Egypt..I trust that I may count upon the cordial co-operation of all my colleagues in thedepartments concerned in realizing this first instalment of an Imperial air policy, whichcannot but have most important and far reaching results in the consolidation of theEmpire.In view of the public interest in the whole question I propose to lay the report before Parliament at an early date.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.2 2nd November, 1919.
ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CIVIL AVIATION.Report on Imperial Air Routes.A. 19355.To the Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, M.P., Secretary of State for Air,The Committee ha.ve given very careful consideration to the question &quot; How best to organize Imperial Air Routes,&quot; which was the question specifically referred to themfor consideration and advice when they were appointed. The Committee understand the designation &quot;Imperial Air Routes&quot; to mean routes which will enable the newtransport element, namely, the air, to be made use of in speeding up communication between the various portions of the British Empire. This Report throughout dealsonly with heavier-than-air machines. The Committee propose to submit a further reportdealing with the subject of the possible use of lighter-than-aircraft in the developmentof Imperial air routes.They have considered Canada, Newfoundland, South Africa, India, Australia andNew Zealand as the main outlying portions of the British Empire, and to these theywould add Egypt, to which they should direct their attention, and have thought it best to confine themselves to the question of the establishment of main trunk lines connectingthese portions of the Empire with the United Kingdom by air. Such trunk lines would no doubt in course of time be supplemented, if not preceded, by local lines connectingup the the various Dominions and Colonies internally and with other Dominions and colonies, but this portion of the problem is one which the Committee do not conceivethemselves to be called upon to deal except on specific reference by the Secretary ofState.They offer the following observations on the problem of main trunk lines : At the outset they wish to make it very clear that they have in their investigation keptalways in view the present financial position of the country. That position obviouslydictates restriction of proposals to what is necessary to meet the essential needs of thepresent situation.Under existing conditions it is not practicable at the moment to recommend any large appropriation of public funds by way of investment in what is now an entirelynovel business. The Committee, however, are of opinion that, taking a long view, anyinvestment such as they suggest will at least bring the necessary experience to help toestablish flying ultimately on a paying basis.The Committee realize to the full the unique character of the problem, which is,whether any, and if so, what steps can and should be taken now to develop civiltransport over those routes in an element wherein the controlling and limiting factorsare as yet very imperfectly understood. There is little guidance to be found inexperience, but as compensation there are no precedents or vested interests to hamperan attempt to solve the problem.The Committee have started from the basis that the problem is one which is capable of solution, that there is a future for the development of the air as a newmeans of civil transport and communication, in spite of the present handicaps from a technical, operational and financial point of view. They feel it necessary to endeavourto strike a mean between the view of those who, in contemplating the development ofair transport, lose sight of the difficulties and dangers which at present beset it, andadvocate too ambitious schemes, and those others who, while freely admitting theprogress of aviation on the Service side during the war, and the great influences which that progress exercised on the position, are yet very doubtful whether the war develop-ment went so far as to establish even the practicability in the immediate future ofmaking use of the air element for everyday commercial purposes.The Committee have been impressed by the unanimity of the opinion of those whohave identified themselves with development in civil aviation as to the fact that theproblems involved in each section of an Imperial route vary greatly, and thereby render the formulation of a general Government policy exceptionally difficult at present.
The Committee accordingly find themselves without enough data or experience tojustify them in recommending any rigid policy involving the immediate planning andinitiation of any complete scheme of Imperial routes at present. They have come to theconclusion that in the meantime the correct policy is to initiate immediate action to-obtain experience, and that such experience should be obtained on that part of thewhole field of Imperial routes which offers the best chance of success, leaving the initiation of action elsewhere for further consideration when fuller experience has beenobtained.They have no hesitation in deciding that the proper place for initial action is the route from this country to India, and ultimately thence to Australia. In the second place stands the route from this country to South Africa, which on the section from thiscountry to Egypt would be the same as the first route. They consider it would be wisein the first instance to deal with the problem in reference to one section of the route from this country to India, viz., the section between Egypt and Karachi, leaving to theIndian Government the initiation and encouragement of the internal air routes in India.They are convinced that this section is the sphere in which experience can be mostreadily and usefully obtained, as the conditions of aerial navigation on this section arejudged to be more favourable than elsewhere. Assuming that an air route is to beestablished between these points, the first question which arises is the broad question ofprinciple as to the agency by which that work can be undertaken.The point has been made that at this moment the readiest way of testing the airpossibilities of the route for civil purposes would simply be to give to the Koyal AirForce squadrons stationed on or near the route the task of carrying maiis, passengers,&amp;c., in so far as their service duties allow them to do so, or, in the alternative, toincrease the formations for strictly service purposes by additional formations to meet thecivil requirements. The Committee have considered this method, and have &quot;decided against it. There are weighty Service objections against the use of the Koyal AirForce for civil purposes, under either of the two alternatives above mentioned, and theCommittee cannot avoid the conclusion that under neither alternative would theconditions be such as to enable any real judgment to be formed or experience gained asto the possibilities of civil aviation. They must also give weight to the consideration that private enterprise would be entitled to raise strong objection to State nionoply ordirect State competition on what the Committee themselves find to be the best spherefor trying out the possibilities of the new form of transport. There is also the very important consideration that in the view of the Committee the development of aircraft for Civil and Service purposes must before long result in their differentiation into distincttypes, and that consequently assistance in the development of commercial aviationcannot be permanently expected from the Service side otherwise than in the spheresreferred to below, such as common use of aerodromes, wireless and meteorologicalfacilities, &amp;c.Assuming, then, that direct action by the Eoyal Air Force is set aside, theCommittee have had to consider what other arrangements are feasible. They are met at the outset by the difficulty that without State aid in one form or another they see no prospect, more especially in present financial conditions, of any private enterpriseembarking capital in a venture of this description where, as they have already observed,experience is lacking and many unknown factors will come in. The Committee have accordingly come to the conclusion that State aid in one form or another will be essential. They consider that there is a case for such State aid, holding that the moderate expenditure which in present financial conditions is all that should be con-templated is justified as an investment in an undertaking with very great ultimatepossibilities. The Committee have considered three possible methods of organizing theundertaking: (1.) Operation by the State itself.(2.) The constitution of a Chartered Company combining State and private capital.(3.) Private enterprise State aided.The Committee are against (1), operation by the State itself. They consider thatin a new enterprise of this description the work of initiation and development is workwhich the State cannot perform in such a way as to enable the possibilities to be properly tried out.The Committee have had before them various suggestions for (2), the formation ofa Chartered Company combining State and private enterprise.   This proposal presents(7718)
pertain.&apos;attractive; features. Tt is argued that it would enable the organization to he soformed as fco contain representatives of different interests concerned, such as aircraftconstructors, shipping companies, and the various departments of State, including thePost Office. It is argued thnt it would secure a single and uniform development ofpolicy, the co-ordination of all effort, the standardization of material, the avoidance ofany objection on the ground of monopoly, and more or less definite support to theexisting aircraft contractors by preferential treatment in the supply of material. - TheCommittee appreciate these arguments, but have come to the conclusion that: theycannot recommend this form of organization, for the following reasons : The enterpriseunder consideration is of all the enterprises one in which it is essential that the directionshould be free from stereotyped methods and open to new ideas and suggestions, eventhose which would normally be regarded as imaginative. The concentration of all british aerial effort into a single organization would have a narrowing tendency likelyto jeopardize success. There is a serious risk that a Chartered Company would tendto develop a system of bureaucratic control open to the same objections as direct control by the State.The Committee consider that too much weight can easily be attached at thepresent to the arguments for standardization.They have therefore come to the conclusion that the third method is the soundone, i.e., the use of private enterprise with some measure of State aid behind it. Theywould point out that it is in this way that the development of British trade andindustry has been attained in the past, and.that it best secures the initiative and drivewhich are vital in the undertaking now under review. At a later stage of the general development it may be well that other methods may be usefully employed, but at thisstage the Committee hold that the case is one for the application of the traditionalBritish method of private initiative and private enterprise, with just such assistancefrom the State as is requisite for the securing of success.They have considered closely the problem of the form which this State assistance should take. There are certain facilities required for air navigation which are clearlybest provided by the State, such as meteorological and wireless information and the like. These the State should in any case provide, but the Committee think that itmust go further and undertake the provision of what may be called Air Ports, i.e., the terminal and intermediate aerodromes and emergency landing grounds. The provisionof these by private capital would lay an initial burden on the enterprise, which wouldbe likely to be fatal to its inception. Further, if, as the Committee anticipate, the enterprise develops and establishes itself, it is an expenditure on air ports that theState might expect to obtain a return in the shape of charges for use. Moreover, theCommittee are of opinion that, when aerial transport over Imperial air routes is an assured success, it will ,be of the greatest importance that the air ports should beowned and controlled by the State. The Committee regard this as an important factor in preventing operating firms from building up &quot;good-will&quot; of a serious characteragainst the Government. State ownership will give a very full degree of control bythe State over commercial flying, and will prevent the very dangerous possibility ofmonopolistic control if the aerodromes were privately owned and merged into a Trust.The Committee generally attach the utmost importance to the principle of Stateownership and control of air ports, and they think the matter of sufficient importanceto justify it being brought to the notice of all Governments of the Empire.In the case of the Egypt India air route the Committee understand that it hasbeen decided for purely Service purposes to establish and maintain aerodromes and landing grounds for the transit of machines to India, and that proposals to this endhave been approved by the War Cabinet. Consequent upon this decision it appears tothem that the approval and execution of this scheme, while meeting Service needs, willalso be a starting point for the civil development of the air route from Egypt to India ;they are advised that the civil air route at all events at the outset will best follow the route laid down for Service machines. They strongly urge therefore that the Serviceproposals for joining India and Egypt by air should be put into effect as soon aspossible.They are advised that when this is done it will be possible to pass one civil machineper week each way between Egypt and India. It may well be that, as civil aviationdevelops, further facilities will be required, which facilities would naturally mean further expenditure on the routes for purely civil purposes. The Committee, while recognizingthat additional expenditure beyond that incurred on the establishment of this route for service purposes is inevitable, as the facilities are increased to meet civil requirements,
find it-difficult! to. estimate closely at the. moment either the total amount so requiredor the periods when the additional expenditure will be necessary;-: but clearly the needfor additional expenditure must be taken into account now.It is then necessary to consider what concrete action should be taken to giveprivate enterprise its opportunity of getting on to the route. The element in whichthe air has the advantage over other means of transport is speed. ,The Committee are.advised, for example, that the time occupied in transit from Egypt to India by sea,namely, 9 days at a moderate computation, could be reduced by not less than 3^ daysif the transit were made by air, and in the future might be still further reduced.Accordingly it would seem that the first step is to ascertain on what termsarrangements can be made for the carriage of mails by air the carriage of expressgoods and of passengers being relied on as ancillary to the carriage of mails. TheCommittee recommend that the Post Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry,/should forthwith draw up a form of tender for an air mail contract between Egypt andKarachi and/or Bombay. It would be put up to limited competition between firms ofsuch standing as to make it reasonably certain that they could perform the servicestendered for. This contract should provide for alternative tenders for services of varying frequency per week, and would be fitted in with the standing ocean mailcontract. In calling for tenders it would be made clear what facilities the state would provide in the way of meteorological, wireless and other information, and in theAvay of aerodromes and landing grounds. At the outset these facilities may have tobe restricted to those provided under the purely service scheme above mentioned,particulars of which if approved would be made known to tenderers, and which would cover the transit of one machine per week each way.Tenderers would be requested to quote for more frequent services on the basis thatthe State would, in presence of the tenders, consider that further facilities as above-could properly be provided.It appears to the Committee that the above method of procedure is the only wayof arriving at a judgment ou experience of what the cost and income of an air route onthis section is likely to be. In the light of this experience the whole problem would befurther considered, and a more general policy for further development prepared.The Controller-General of Civil Aviation has during: the course of the meetingsinformed the Committee as to what is being done for civil aviation in other countries,and the Committee understand that he is forwarding to the Secretary of State astatement of this information, from which it will be seen that in certain cases subsidies and other forms of assistance are given which are not included in the recommendationsof this Report. The Committee suggest, as a possible additional form of assistance, thata certain quantity of the aircraft engines and material which have been declared surplusby the Royal Air Force could be placed at the disposal of the Civil Aviation department for distribution free in this country and the colonies.The Committee understand that in India and Egypt local regulations prevent anypioneer work whatever in civil aviation being carried out. The policy underlying thoseregulations is not a matter for the Committee. From the point of view of civil aviation,which is their concern, they consider it very desirable that all prohibitory bans on civilaviation, so far as those parts of the British Empire which are under the direct control-of the Imperial Government are concerned, should be removed at once, and thatrepresentations be made to the Dominions and India in favour of the immediate-acceptance of a similar policy.The conclusions of the Committee may be summed up as follows: (I.) That the air route from Egypt to India should be developed.(2.) That the development should be by private enterprise backed by state assistance, and that the State assistance should take the form of providingmeteorological and wireless services and of air ports, including the provisionof the sheds required for running purposes.(3.) That the Service proposals for these air ports should be carried through assoon as possible.(4.) That the necessity for additional expenditure on the development of these ports for purely civil purposes in order to meet the increase in frequency ofthe services should not be overlooked, though only experience can showwhat such expenditure may be.(5.) That the General Post Office, in consultation with the Air Ministry, should,draw up a form of tender for an air mail contract between Egypt and Indiato be put up for competition.

That a certain quantity, of the aircraft engines and material which have-Ivrm -it- yj-been declared surplus-by the&apos;(Royal Air; Force could be placed at thedisposal of the Civil Aviation Department&apos; for distribution free in this-country and the colonies.(7.) That the prohibitory ban on civil aviation in Egypt and India should beremoved.These modest recommendations are made on the assumption that the State intends to maintain flying supremacy by supporting the Service side at a level that will ensure^the safety of the position.(Signed)   Weir, Chairman.,,      Inchcape.J.
