FUWRE CF THE SUPREME ECONOMIC COUNCIL.Extract from the Mlnutea cf the Permanent Committeeof the Supreme Economic CouncilFourth Meetinr;&apos; 22nd Cctaber 1919.(Circulated ^ith reference to Paper No. CP. 110).MINUTE. No.55.Supply of Austria.The French and British Delegates informed the Committeecf the result of their recent conversations in Paris *ithMM. Clementel, Lcucheur and Sir Jehn Bradbury, on the subjectof the supply of Austria.The Sub-Committee of the CO.R.C which had just bedn .instituted at Vienna, ^ould send its report on the exactsituation in Austria in about a fortnight.It was probable that the general situation v-:as fit thomoment intermediate between that described by the somewhatpessimistic reports previously received and that describedwith a certain amount of optimism by Sir William Gccdeand MM. Olivari and Charren.After having heard the view?s of the Italian Delegatethe Committee agreed that it *ould be most desirable to study, at the meeting cf the S,E^C in Rome, the questionof a general programme, (e.g. a year&apos;a programme) for thesupply of Austria.As regards the question of immediate needs the CommitteeInsisted on the necessity for dealing rapidly w th theproblem to avoid in the near future a crisis of such gravityas would be impossible tb repair.   It mould probably be too late to *ait until the meeting of the S.E.C in Romet* discuss this question.The methods vhich consisted of (1) asking the UnitedStates to give credits fir Austrian supply and (2) eachEuropean Ally making separate leans to Austria, presentedserious and definite difficulties.   The only possible meansof making enemy countries pay for their supply ,vas a first charge on the sums due to us under the head of reparation.The question therefore, clearly depended on the interpretationand the application of article 181 of the Treaty vlthAustria (and eventually of Article 255 of the Treaty with GermanyJ]which interpretation clearly could not be made *lth*ut theconcurrence of the        a signatory to the treaty.Under these conditions, the French Delegate, hayingsuggested that the only hope of a rapid solution of thequestion appeared to lie in the immediate constitution *f aCommittee for the supply of Austria, reporting te the(C*.R.G*and composed in part of the regular personnel of the ConsultativeFood Committee, it *?as decided that a meeting should be held inpar!3 betrsen the delegates of the permanent Committee and therepresentatives of the C.CR*0*o to consider the advisability ofconstituting the proposed Committee:- If not, to assure by anyother means&quot;possible. the immediate supply of food and rawmaterials to Austris.2,fhitehall Gardens, s;V&apos;,l.14th November, 1919.
