. RIolI^ASDlISTA^i5 IN THE BjfipmiBMHT Otf 142mm C0MOTI0ATI0NS IN BUS3IA.rMe^rSfldiam by the yresiflont of the Board of [Trade,, I regard it as of tho greatest importance that we should&apos; en^oturage the eoonomio re cons traction of Bussia in. order topromote British foreign trade m which our own reconstiticticndepends.Bussia is one of the Big fields from which we used&apos; to import largequantities of grain, dairy produce, timber, hides, flax, oil and various raw materials, in return for ocal and manufactured goods;and if we are to secure a held en its potential markets and practicallyunlimited resources a special effort is necessary    The germans have recently sent a strong Economic Mission to-General Denikinfs area.(2)      The greatest difficulty will doubtless be finance, arid itis most important therefore to know what form of assistance willproduoe the greatest&apos;results at the least expense*    I consider -that assistance in reorganizing internal communications in Bussia,especially railways, waterways, .and telegraphs, best fulfils this requirement.&apos;3)      The solution of the transportation problem will alone solvefhe food problem, and will partly solve the raw materials problem,yt will enable Russia to pay idp vital-imports by commodities forexport pending regulation of the,, exchange question.    Without thorestoration or communications norther&apos; form&apos; of economic assistancecan take effect,    Any foreign.. Power -&quot;controlling the communicationssystem will tend to dominate tha^economic -policy of the country, -It the Germans (who are said -tdkhave an organization ready on ilialines proposed by us) gain,control -of the&apos; transportation system,we shall nave lost tne fiys4^?nj^::int.Ae&apos; coming fight with germany for economic supremacy in Russia; before-e the contest is begun,(4)      If it is agreed that communications are to have priority in economic assistance /it is :suggest-ed that Missions of exports in uniform should be sent out similar to those which have been successfullyemployed in Central Kurcpe-, &quot;&quot;--These missions have been doing invaluablework under the heads of,fl) ^Intelligence, (2) Technical advice, (3)Reorganization of International Traffic, (4) Assisting in purchasingof materials,   . A similar&apos; mission or missions to Russia, the costof which would.be small, compared with economic issues at stake shouldbe at the charge of the British&apos;Treasury;   and the emoluments of the experts sent out should be sufficient to secure the services of experienced and qualified men who alone will be of use0    It isnot suggested that there should be big Government relief credits..    Thenecessary funds must be secured :n a commercial basis,(5)      An important point for decision is the status and composition of the proposed mission.    Considerable advantages would be gained by continuing the present system of organising assistance on at leastan outwardly allied basis.    This would co-ordinate all the available resources, assure co-operation between the Allies and facilitate thesupply of sufficient skilled personnel, but there would be disadvantageswhich to my mind more than balance the hoped for advantages.(6)      I would accordingly suggest;-(a)   That an adequate Railway Mission should form part ofthe  newly appointed High Commissioner1s Staff,I (D)   If the Cabinet so decide, that we should inform tho^ies, in-order that they may participate if theyvthinkA* C* GBDDDS.14, 31. 19.
