Port Said.fl)   This camp was formed in 1915 to accommodatesome 4,000 Armenians belonging to the Jebel-IvLura district of Syria (near Antioch) who were driven from their homesby the Turks and were rescued by a French naval squadron and brought to Port Said.   They were subsequently joined by other Armenians from other  arts of Syria and Mesopotamia,and in October 1919 the total number of persons in the   ampwas 5,796. 13&apos;(2)   Up to 31st July 1918 the cost of maintaining the camp was borne by the Egyptian Government (1) assistodby various charitable funds.   Sinde that date almost (2)the \.hole cost has been taken over by *     Army Funds.   Thetotal expenditure between 21st August lyi8 and 31st July1919 amounted to  89,465, or,at the rate of  7,455 per month;and on the 21st august 1919 the rate was reported at&apos;&apos;jver 8,000 per month. (3)(3)   The War Office are anxious that their Votesshould be relieved of a charge which is not directly militaryin character-   the Foreign Office on the other hand have staged(August 25th) th*t they see no prospect of repatriatingthese Armenians Under present conditions, and the uncertaintyrespeotihg the ultimate financial responsibility for the camp seems to have resulted in a certain lack of departmentalinterest in reducing the expenditure.With a view therefore to relieving public fundsas rapidly as possible of this non-effective expenditure i recommend the following proposals!(a) that al3/refugeeD from territory which, in accordancewith the recent agreement between His Majesty&apos;;;.? Governmentand the French Government.&apos; havo passed or are about to passundet French protection (4) shall be repatriated at once,unless the French Government themselves provide for their continued maintenance at port Said or elsewhere.(b) that the responsibility for the future expenditureon this camp shall rest with the Foreign Office, who shall present a separate civil V^te for the maintenance of theremaining refugees, the piovision in jirroy,Votes being reducedby an equal amount.(c) that the remaining refugees (with.the excoption ofjuch as are physically inaapablel be&apos;put to some kind of use-ful wolrk and be paid only if they do work.   ,In December 1918it was reported that about 1.100 men inthe camp were doing nothing.*Eotes:-     (1)   originally charged to the general suspenseaccount against trie British Government, which however has beenwrit4 on off as a contribution by the Egyptian government towards the cost of the war.
( ) The American Hed Cross contributes  8,400 perannum. .There is no ground for asking Egypt to continueto bear the cos v,(3)   a telegram from the General Officer CommandingEgypt dated ,&apos;.agust 23rd 1919 puts the total number of refugees tii&amp;n being maintained, including those at Port Said,at approximately  3,000, and the total co3t at  40,000 permensem which is likely to be increased during the winter., .  It is uncertain what increase, if any, this impliesin the number and cost of refugees at Port Said.(V,   This&quot; would include the Jebel Musa districtreferred to above.B.   Baqubah in Mesopotamia.(1) This camp was formed in August 1918 a3 a refugefor 3ome 40,000 men, women and children (vis:- 30,000 ChristianAssyrians from Turkish Kurdistan and 10,000 Armenians from theVan Vilayet), who had fled before the Turks and Kurds into the occupied territory.Later the number was increased to nearly 50,000 bythe arrival of Armenians from other parts of the Ottoman Empire.(2) The cost is stated to be  6,500 per day, or no lessthan  2,372,500 per annum,   The average cost works out at 36 per head per annum, compared with an average of  15 at thePort Said camp.(3) The Treasury has for 30:&apos;ie time been urging thenecessity of reducing the expenditure on this camp;   bat thereappear to.be serious political difficulties in the way of anydrastic action.   Repatriation is difficult, owing to the hostility of the tribes in the neighbourhood of or on the road to the refugees&apos; tformer homes.   A suggestion that a reservationshould be formed within Mesopotamia territory and the refugeespermanently settled therein would involve the forcibleeviction of the Kurds who at present inhabit the area selected for the purpose -\ a measure to which there aj?e political as well as normal objections.   Ho other alternative seems tohave been suggested beyond transport to Egypt, presumably tothe camp at Port Said, which would merely change the localitywithout solving the problem.(4) No decision has finally been renched as to the ultimateincidence of the very heavy charge involved y/hich is meanwhjtebeing advanced from Army funds.The War Office have maintained that the responsibililymust be with the civil administration;   the latter however are understood to disclaim all liability, on the ground that theirruption of these refugees is due solely to a militarycampaign for which the Array Authorities are responsible, andthat the Arab taxpayer cannot equitably be called upon toaccept the burden of maintaining this camp.Meanwhile the control of the camp has been handled bythe Civil Commissioner. Colonel Wilson, in correspondence wi?*hthe India Office (who have no financial responsibility in thematter) who&apos; in turn consult the Foreign Office and treasury.This is the normal arrangement whfcre sanction is tobe sought for expenditure of any kind by the Civil AdminsGtea-tion.If
If the ehaigo were finally to he impoaod on the OivilAdministration, it would updouhtodiy oauae a very heavy deficit on the Administration^ budget...   Ko oivil Vote haa been taken tomeet such a deficit, as it was understood at the beginning of thefinancial year that none was.likely to be incurred.   moreover the Foreign Office have objected on political grounds to sub-fitting a civil Vote for the Civil Government of occupied enemy territory before the mandate for administering the territoryhas been given to Groat Britain;   accordingly it was agreed thatany such deficit on the Civil Administration of/Syria and palestine should bo net from Army funds.   The same principle would no doubt have to be applied to Mesopotamia,The problem is, how best to combine financial withadministrative responsibility.There seem to be 3 alternatives.-(1)   to regard the War Department as responsible for theoriginal irruption oi..the refugees-, and accordingly to charge thecost of their maintenance directly against Army funds.   In that event the Secretary of State for War would have to defend theexpenditure in Parliament, and would be responsible, through hiaDepartment, for reducing and ultimately abolishing it as rapidly as possible.(2)   to regard the expenditure as a proper charge againstthe funds of the civil administration.   This would be in accord-ance with the normal rule that a civil government iaresponsible for the maintenance of destitute persons within itsown territory.   On the other hand, it mu3t be conceded that itis unreasonable to ask the Arab taxpayer to pay towards, themaintenance of these refugees a sum equal taiitfily to  /? of thetotal revenue of the country.(5)   to make the Foreign Office responsible in the same way aa for the camp at Port Said, and to include this expenditure in the civil Vote, proposed above, for theexpenses of the latter camp.   The question of claiming areasonable contribution from the civil Administration mightire reserved.I favour alternative (3)., and recommend that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs be requested, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for India and theArmy Council, to devote his immediate attention to theproblem of securing effective economics-^(a)   by repatriation, orfb)   by local settlement, of the refugees, combined with(o)   reduction of current expenditure on maintenance,closer supervision of rations, etc., and by putting all whoare physically fit to some useful form of work.fd)   Any persons normally resident in territory that now passed under French control would of course be treatedas proposed under A (3) (a). ,(Intld)   A.C.Treasury, S-.E..11th November, 1919,.w 3-
