LONGWURST7     &apos; 14CABINET.v..;&apos; IRISH   COMMITS.Joint Mote by the Lor a Chancellor ana the MinisterefgP^fsTens;.        &quot; &apos;(Circulated-with reference to the First Report of the Committeoon Ireland, Paper No. CP.56).Thoso who have signed this note feel somo doubtwhethor tho memorandum circulated brings out sufficientlyclearly that the Bill is submitted to the Cabinet asrsprosonting a plan which tho Committee can roeommondas an offer to the Irish (if tho Finance and other reserved matters can be adjusted) and that the Committee desire toknow whether the plan is acceptable to tho Cabinet for thispurpose before proceeding with the consideration of theother matters referred to them,7o do not, speaking for ourselves, wish it to boconsidered that&apos; wo advise that such a Bill should be pressed through all its stages unless we become satisfiedthat responsible people, with the necessary followingboth in the South and the North of Ireland, will acceptthe offer find form the: Governments necessary to maintainlaw and or dor.;;e think it probable that the Sinn Feiners willreject the offer with contempt and that the Ulstermen willnot welcome it.   Should this turn out to be the ease we should desire an opportunity of reconsidering tho position;but we agree that in any event it would be right to putforward the proposal so that the offer made to the Irish ofa moans of self-government should bo placed on record andproceeded with when responsible people show themselveswilling to undertake the duties of Government.(Sd). Birkenhead.(Sd). Lo^orthington evans .I would in addition add that Iassont to this proposed bill as affording an ingenious strengthening of out tacticalposition before the world.   I am absolutely satisfied thatthe Sinn Feiners will refuse it.   Otherwise in the present state of Ireland I could not even be a party to making theoffer, for I believe that the Sinn Feiners if they did acceptthoir Parliament, would only use it for the purpose offorwarding separation.(Sd). Birkenhoad,4 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.\7.November 11th, 1919.
