3Ki3 Britain -) Prop&apos;RECORD OP PROCEEDINGS AT THE MEETING V/ITH THE NATIONALUNION OP RAILV&apos;AYMViH OH THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13TH AT 4 P.M.AT 10 DOWNING STREET.The Prime Minister presided,Mr. Thomas began by stating that in his view the presentmethod of dealing with the matter was not likely to lead to asettlement.     The Prime Minister could not be expected to go into details of the various proposals nor could they beconveniently dealt with at so large a meeting.Referring to tho new proposals he said that those for thepermanent way men showed very little increase.   He admitted inthe traffic departments there were.Increases for guards andshunters, but in the goods staff no Increase was proposed forporters though there was some increase for checkers and callers-upeA new and complicated scheme had been put forward for signalmen,based on lever movements.Sir Herbert Walker explained that the scheme was based onthe scheme in force on the North Eastern Railway, but he hoped thatit showed an improvement on that scheme as the result of experience.Mr. Thomas said that the scheme had been examined for him byan expert on the North Eastern Railway and that so far as some ofthe details were concerned it was not so favourable as the NorthEastern scheme, and in particular he referred to the number ofmarks allowed for taking telephone and telegraph messages.He went on to say that it appeared to him that the only wayto settle details was for departmental committees of the companies to meet departmental committees of the Unions and examine thefigures in relation to the particular grades, but these committees should be empowered to go beyond the figures, and he inquired whatis an estimate of a fair minimum wage, 53/- nowadays being inhis viow equivalent to 24/9 pre-war.
(2)- 14.5He then referred to the recent award to the engineering trades of an additional 5/-,   This was sure to lead, to agitationby the railwaymen for an addition to war wage, end the Governmentwould, in his opinion, be wise if instead, of waiting for a crisis they took steps to meet it.Sir Robert Home explained that the main reason for theaward in the Engineering Trades appears to have been the prosperity of the Trade.   Reference is indeed made to the possibilityof an increase in the cost of living, but since the award meathad gone down in price and a reduction In the price of coal wasin contemplation!Mr. Thomas then returned to the question of sub-committeesand said that these would be no use if the Companies1 side of thecommittees had instructions not to alter the figures. TheGovernment seemed to think that they were framing rates for alltime, but in the next ten years the cost of living was not likely,in his view, to fall below 70)i above the pre-war level.He asked whether it was any use wasting time discussingmatters that could not happen for 10 or 20 years.He then referred to cortain things which he consideredconstituted.anomalies, platelayers, for example, got practicallynothing out of what are commonly known as the side shows.Shunters were rated, say at 30/- for an Q hour day, and driversat 36/- for a 10 hour day, but the value per hour was greater inthe case of the shunters than in that of the drivers and no allowance is made to the shunters in the present proposals forthis greater value *. Some discussion followed as to whether when a signalmen was moved from a. 10 hour cabin to an 8 hour cabin before the intro-duction of the 8 hour day the reduction in the hours was t]iemeasure of the increased remuneration for the more responsiblework, and Sir Herbert talker pointed out that in some cases inaddition to the reduction in the hours, there would be an increase&apos;In the remuneration,Mr.. Thomas referred to a London &amp; South Western agreement
in i913 when an offer ^as made to men in 10 hour cabinsof either an additional 2/- Per &quot;-eek or a reduction in thehours to 3. Thomas &quot;i&apos;ould have accepted the latter, buthe  ras surprised that the. men themselves preferred the extramoney.The prime -minister  inquired whether the classificationbased on lever movements had not met any grievance that mightexist with regard to signalmen on this point.Mr. Thorias replied that he agreed that this was the case if a satisfactory basis is agreed upon, and this should bedealt with by a sub-committee, and he pressed that all suchmatters should be dealt with by sub-committees, for instance,goods managers should meet representatives of goods workers andthe same for other grades, some elasticity being given to thecommittees in dealing with ratesi*.fter a short adjournment the Prime ^vaster replied thathe had some difficulty in following the matter as owing to his parliamentary duties he had had no opportunity of a preliminary discussion with his colleagues.   He was quite in agreement thata meeting like the present one could not go into detail, and theproposal as to sub-committees was a sensible one.There must he, however, some limits to the powers of thecommittees.   It had been indicated at the previous meeting thatthe Railway Executive Committee were v:tiling to lift &apos;the top ofthe ladder and this had been done substantially by the increasein the rates proposed for guards.If the Government assented to the appointment of theproposed sub-committees the limits in the scheme must be regardedas a Second Steading principle..   Anomalies could be gone intobut the Co.&apos;.:. littees could not widen the limits.   The maximum hadbeen raised by 5/-.Mr. Thomas agreed that the sub-committees could not haveplenary powers hut he asked whether they could go into thesc des and see what they could do with them, and the Prime
Minister replied that they would do so within the &apos;present limits of40/- and 65/--.It was agreed that sub-committees should be set up for thegoods, permanent way, traffic and locomotive departments andshould meet next week.   (It has since been arranged that theyshould have their first meeting on Wednesday Nov. 19-)Earlier in the discussion Mr. Thomas had mentioned that hethought there would be no difficulty as to the new machinery to be set up for the settlement of future disputes, and the PrimeMinister referring to that statement said that he was glad to hearthat the general principle of Wages Boards, National and Central,is acceptable.   They would not apply to Ireland or to theexisting negotiations^Mr. Thomas said he supp, sed this only meant that the boards would not deal with Irish questions but that there wouldbe nothing to preclude a separate body being set up for Ireland.He entirely agreed that the Boards should not deal withthe present negotiations.Sir Eric Geddes said that certainly there was nothing toprevent a separate body being set up for Ireland, but on the boards now under consideration there would only be British general managers.The Prime Minister went on to state that he thought thatrepresentation of the men on the Railway Advisory Board would bea great step forward for Labour..   The Minister would be preparedto give a representation of 3 on that committee for the tworailway unions.Mr. Thomas inquired about the representation of users of railways on the National Board and Sir Eric Geddes explained thatthe 4 representatives of users would be appointed by theParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, theCo-operative Union, the Associated  Chambers of Commerce and the confederation of British Industries respectively, and that theChairman would be an impartial person nominated by the Government,Mr. Thomas asked whether that meant that the Chairman would
be judicial, and the Prime Minister said that this wouldnot necessarily be the case though It might be so.   The*proposals of the Government as to the Wages Board would beput forward in writing.Sir Eric Geddes asked for an early decision as torepresentation on the Advisory Committee as he wished toget it to work and Mr-. Thomas promised to communicate withMr. Bromley and send a reply as early as possible.Finally Mr. Thomas asked what would take place about the5/- which he had asked for at the beginning of the discussion,did the Government intend to give it?The Prime Minister said that the proposal was a new oneto him, he had only heard of it that afternoon, and he statedthat he understood that the present cost of living was thesame as at the time when the last Increase had been given.
