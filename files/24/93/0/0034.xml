[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1919.SECRET.,-nr.n.ii,,,......,........-........,.....,I CP. /33\3CABINET.HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT BILL (No. 2).Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland.I FULLY agree with the Memorandum (C.P.-61) of the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries on this Bill.The adoption of the principle of the Bill would be fatal to Irish agricultureThere are special considerations which render such a principle peculiarly inapplicableto Ireland. In Ireland there is a large rainfall, and the number of days on which theland can be cultivated aDd crops sown, cleaned and harvested, is less than in GreatBritain. Tillage would suffer, production would decrease, and the whole effect on theagricultural community would be highly disturbing.It has also to be remembered that in Ireland a very large proportion of the farmers are occupiers of small holdings, and, in return for certain accommodation from thelarger farmers, often give their labour to the latter. It would be impossible by legislation to meet such cases.I earnestly hope that the inclusion of agricultural labour within the scope of theBill will not be sanctioned.I. M..13.&apos;. ;Irish Office, November 15, 1919.
