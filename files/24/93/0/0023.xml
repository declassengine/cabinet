HOUSDIG IN AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.(l)   Dr. AddisonS memorandum on Housing (C.P.3) reveals a situation which profoundly affects the Government&apos;s programme of increased food production (a) &quot;by farmers generally and \1) &quot;by the intensive cultivation to &quot;be practised &quot;by small holders under the landsettlement scheme.   I deal with the latter in a separate memorandum.(2)   As to Rural Housing generally, the methods of direct action proposed by Dr. Addison, i,e. by asking the Offioe of Works to providehouses &quot;ky the thousand and iy employing some Of the large Londoncontractors to get to work on a similarly large scale, will not &quot;be applicable to scattered rural areas.   My Department have already con-siderable experience of the attitude of large &quot;builders to the provisionof cottages on County Council Small Holding  states.   Very few willtender at all and such tenders as are received are so ridiculously highthat they cannot be considered.   The difficulties of securing adequatelabour and materials are so immense that few big contractors whe can secure a contract for 100 or 1,000 houses on one site in a new suburbwill even discuss the building of the same number scattered over, a   riCounty.   For rural housing therefore the Local Authorities are thrownbaok on the small country builder, but only in rare cases will hetender because the. arrears of jobbing work and repairs all over the countryside are so enormous that he can secure all the work for whichhe can supply labour without giving a definite price and he is certaintherefore of a good profit without risk on the orders he carries out.(3)   From a Minute supplied to my Department by the Ministry ofHealth on the 17th October it appears that the total number ofhouses to be erected by Rural District Councils all over England forwhich tenders had been approved by that date amounted to 673 only,674 of which to be built by 23 Rural District Councils are estimated to cost on an average, for land, lay-out and building,  764 per house;In other words about seventeen houses per oounty are about to be built.Of these 23 Counoils, some (such as Luton, Chertsey and Spsom) are insuburban rather than rural areas and the number of cottages to be built in really agricultural areas is almost negligible.   This isprofoundly discouraging to farmers who are exhorted by the Governmentto cultivate more intensively and cannot even now secure sufficientlabour for lack of oottages for their labourers to liTe in.(4)   The failure of Rural District Counoils to rise to the dutyof providing houses is easily understood.   The Councils have littlevision;   they distrust, &quot;because they do not understand, theGovernments system of loan and subsidy, and in any case they cannotbuild in an economical and seemly way because they do not employskilled architects to design and superintend the work.(5)   In Borne Counties I think that arrangements could be made whereby County Councils should carry out housing schemes on behalfof the Rural District Councils, the finance to be found by theDistrict Councils through the Ministry of Health in the ordinary way.The. cases in my mind are those County Councils which have set up a
competent architectural staff to provide cottages under the Board     Jof Agriculture13 land settlement scheme at   In some cases the council&apos;s, with the permission of the Board, are setting up WorksDepartments to &quot;build &quot;by direct administration, owing to the impossibility of getting contractors to tender,   The large Estatesthey have purchased have in many cases considerable woodlands whichthey are cutting down to free the land for cultivation, convertingthe timber and making their own gates, fencing, etc., for the land and the timber carcassing for their buildings.   In such cases itshould he possible for my Department to put pressure on the CountyCounoils to provide sites for ordinary labourers&apos; cottages on thefringes of their Small Holdings Estates for the Rural district councils and to build for them while they are building cottages fortheir ex-service settlers.   I am prepared to press this on theCounty Councils in cases where my advisers say that it will be feasible.   I do not pretend that this course would yield thousands ofcottages, but it might be done on 20 or 30 County Council Estates inthe country and it would at least form a standard in the county and show that something is being done.(6)   The idea might be extended by an enlargement of the cottageholding programme of my Department.   For cottage holdings built on anything exceeding 1 acre of land the finance comes under the LandSettlement (Facilities) Act, i.e. no part of the loss falls on therates, but even under the finance of the Housing Act, which requires the Local Authority to contribute the annual product of a Id. rate,the relief to the Exchequer is Email,   For example, the annual yield of a Id. rate in the Rural District Councils referred to in paragraph(3) above is a little under  250.(7.)   I mention this figure in order  to show that if the cottageholding policy laid down in the Land Settlement (Facilities) Actwere enlarged considerably so as to relieve the general housingshortage as well as to stimulate closer settlement on the land foragricultural purposes, the Treasury would not be appreciablyprejudiced, while County Councils, who are already developing bigbuilding programmes for land settlement proper, would Ire able to lend much needed help to rural housing without setting up any freshorganisation for the purpose.(8)   If the Cabinet accepts this suggestion, the Ministry ofHealth would have to undertake the financing of tho scheme, as the funds provided under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act for landsettlement proper do not leave any margin for undertaking generalrural housing.    I only propose this employment of County Councilsbecause I believe that seme of them can do the work which the rural district Councils are obviously not doing.I therefore recommond that the Board of Agriculture beauthorised to assist the Ministry of Health in its housing programme by developing the building activities of County Councils on the lines indicated above.L of F.14th November, 1919.
