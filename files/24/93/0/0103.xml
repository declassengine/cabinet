By Minute of&apos; the .9th May, 1919, ( pay of the RoyalHavy) the War Cabinet decided that :-&quot;(a]   the existing separation allowances should oontiaueuntil the 31st December, 1919 and(b)   the future of these allowances from that date shouldbe the subject of further consideration, regard byiiighad to the cost of living in determining the question&quot;,Tho Jerram Report had proposed that the allowances for children should bo permanent but the continuance of the wife16separation allowance after the 1st January, 19S0 should dependon the cost of living.     If by that date the oost of livingdecreased by 25 per.cent, tho allowances other than those for children should be withdrawn or - If the decrease were lessthan 25 per cent ,r should be proportionately roducod by theamount of the decrease in tho cost of livingsThe view was expressed at the War Cabinet that tho proposals regarding the wifors separation.allowance might bo agreed to,but the Government should not be committed to a new systom of separate allowances for ohildren.;    The pay of men should hesuch as to warrant no olalm for children1 s or other allowancesaThe decision finally taken by the Tar Cabinet does not however go further than making tho continuance of separation allowances dependent upon the cost of living at 1st January, 1920,,The War Cabinet decision was oommunioated to men of tlieRoyal Uavy and Royal Marine in Monthly Order No.1809 as follows&quot;Separation parents&apos; and dependants&apos; hllowances and allot-ments concession- ,    These allowances will remain inforce at. the present rates until 31st December, 1919,before which date,the whole subjeot will be further con-sidered, regard being had in determining the question tothe cost of living&quot;*&apos;ARMY.: The decision as regards the Army was oh the same lines andwas communioated in Army Order 325/1919 of the 13th September,1919, in the following terms-&quot;The existing separation, parents  and dependants allow-ances and the concession granted by Army Order l/l918,under which the allotment from a soldier1b pay in order to qualify for separation-or dependant&apos;s allowance is issued from public funds, will continue until 31st December,19190The future of. these allowances from that dote la and^stto further consideration for all vho are now entitle? tothem&quot;o
The following note by Sir C. Harris elucidates thepooiiion as regards reenlisted men;-Army Separation Allowances *Early in 1919 soldiers then In the ranks as wellas some who had been demobilised were reenlisted for periods of 2. 3, and 4 years.    The orders on the subjectstated that &quot;the rates of separation and dependantsallowance i .eluding special parents allowance now infarce will be continued in the case of men in respect ofwhom ihey were issuable on 10th December 1918&quot;.Married men wer6 acoepted fcr reen listment, but it was stated that separation a^lowaa ce would not be payable in respect cf any man marrying after reenlistment, unless he was admitted to the married ?sTaolishment.When the new scales of pay were promulgated inSeptember it was stated that the future of separation allowances after the 31st of December 1919 was subject tofurther consideration for all who are now entitled toit.   (Army Order 325 of 13th September, 1919).This may be regarded aa a condition attached tothe new rates of pay, and as superseding the promiseabove referred to that the rates cf separation allowance in force in Deoember 1918 would be continued.I have not been able to lay hands on any order issuedfcy the War Office making the future rate of separationallowance dependent upon the cost of living, but thepoint is hardly material in view of the Admiralty publica-tion to that effect.For men enlisted without previous service, or re-enlisted on normal engagements, a form is signed by every recruit to the effect that he understands that he hasno unaonditional right to separation allowances.Air Force,The position as regards the Air Force appearsto be somewhat similar to that of the Army.      Anoto by the Assistant Financial Secretary is appended.Separation Allowance - Note as to R.A.F.Commitments.For the present purposes we may leave out cfaccount men serving for the period of occupation only;it is assumed that these men will be allowed to retain their allowances (both rates and conditions) for theremaining period of their servioe.The
Nov.     125If, as will presumably be the case, the cost of livingat the beginning of next year has increased, then the Govern-ment appear to be committed to the principle that separation allowances should continue for the time being.It does not, however, necessarily follow that theseallowances would be continued at their present scale, since it can conceivable be argued that the intention of the WarCabinet was to determine the principle and not the scale.If this is admitted and the cost of living justifies allowancesThe categories to be considered ftr the future areas follows(a) Men who have extended their service for two, threetr four years,   in these cases we are committed to continuingSeparation Allowance at existing rates for all men who marrybefore 31st December 1919, or such further date as may be announced.(b) Men who have enlisted on normal engagements before 1st January 192c (or later date if so decided ) - no comralt-ment to any definite scale beyond 31.IS.19.   The order intro-ducing the new scheme of pay said, that &quot;the present rates of separation Allowance will be continued under existing condi-tions as to entitlement until 31.12.19^ when the rates andconditions of issue will be again reviewed.&quot;   In the instruc-tions under which recruits have been taken In during thisyear, it is provided that &quot;men enlisting under these instructions-tions and entitled to Separation Allowance under the existing conditions, will continue to be so entitled.- The rates andconditions of issue will, however, be subject to such alt era-tions as may be prescribed from time to time,   until further notice is given men marrying after enlistment will also be eligible for Separation Allowance, but this privilege may be restricted at a later&quot; date&quot;&apos;It will be seen from the foregoing that there is some .moral obligation to continue Separation Allowance in theseoases in some form or other.   .(c) Ken who enlist on normal engagements for the future *In these oases our action is of course quite free.(dependants&apos; allowance not dealt with above).Cost of Living*The variations in the average percentage increase in theprice of all commodities during the 11 months ended November1919 are shewn in the fallowing table prepared by theMinistry of LabourJan. 120 June 105Feb. 120 July 105-110Men. 116 August 115Aplv.110 Sept.   115May   lo5 Oct.     120
(Sgd*)   G, BARSTOW.24th November, 1919*after 1919, some decision must be arrived at as to the soaleat whioh they should be continued.The, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry :-,re about teconfer on the Admiralty proposals for the continuance of separation Allowe-nde to children, and it is suggested thatin instruction should be given them to prepare a jointscheme for the consideration of the Finance Committee by anearly date in December^ gay 7th December at latest.
