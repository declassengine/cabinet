T\^ RATES OP V:AG^5 IF T^T, BUILDING TRADff.w* Memorandum byr the First Comr.ilseioner of Works .On the l?;t October last, I addressed a Memorandum to theWar cabinet (G.T.8248) concerning the hampering effect upon thebuilding werk of my Department (principally in connection.with housing gch,ri?rs and the provision of buildings for the Pensionsand ethf-r Ministries) cf the very hi ;h rates of v/a      which arebeing1paid by private employ*rs to workmen engaged in thebuilding tradeMemoranda en this question have also bem sent t* theCabinet by the Minister of pensions, the Minister tf Labour, theMinister of Health and the- Chancellor of the isxohe-qtur.Sine? my Jtmer;-ndum v/as written, the p*3ition hay becomeoo acutf that I feel obliged to prcs i for a pronouncement by theCabinet with regard to the Policy which is to b* pursued bythe Government in dealing with building operations *So far a*; my Department is concerned the present position may be Summed up as follows :-(1) There is a great scarcity of building ^abour.(2) Much of the labour which exiits is engaged on private%prk at ratf-s of rages in excess of those approved by theMinister of Labour, and my Department is pledged not to pay&quot;unapproved rates.(3) Unlers by some means labour can be made available atthe approved rates(a) The health and comfort of public servants must suffer&apos;  through ftr.sle.ot of the upkeep of the builuings theyoccupy.(b) My Department&apos;s Housing Scbu- e must be held in abeyance.(e) The.ur;*rnt requirements of other Departments,such as the Ministry of Pension., cannot     met.A further difficulty has now arisen in connection with thedemands of the post Office for the provision of temporary accommodation throughout the oountry in connection with theirChristmas postal work.   A very large amount of work has to be&apos;concentrated into a very short space of time, and hundreds of extra men will v-e needed, otherwise the whole Christmas businessof the Post Office will break down.The Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour as wellas myself have urged the cabinet to re-esta1 lish a system ofcontrol vy licence in the -uilaing trade with a view to the concentration of all available larour on works of necessity,instead of allowing it to be absorbed on private undertakingssuch as&apos;the erection of Film Factories and places of amusement.
H .Hi- Office of Works,io^H November, 1919.The Licensing Authority would, I take it, he the Ministerof Health.   It mi,$it &apos;!,e   possible&apos; to make it a condition ofeach licence that if the wa -ts laid do&apos;n vy the Minister oflabour for the &quot;Building Trade were exceeded, the licence&apos; wouldbe witharawn,.   This-would ope rate- as seme check on the com-petftion between contractors for &quot;building labour.If the flaMntt do not think this course possible, IWould ask that the Building Labour committee of the Ministrycf Labour be dissolved;.   My Department would then be free asin pre-war times to make tho best arrangements it could forcarrying out the- important building work-&quot; which it.has in hand.It will be seen that this question is one of extreme urgency, demanding an immediate decision.(Sgd..)
