I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, four papers on questions 121relating to Mesopotamia, comprising : (i.) A memorandum by the General Staff on Mesopotamia (Appendix I).(ii.) An extract from a General Staff memorandum on Mesopotamia garrisonswith remarks on the expense of quartering (Appendix II.).(iii.) A General Staff memorandum on the railway policy in Mesopotamia witha summary of the expenditure involved (Appendix III.),(iv.) A memorandum   by  Sir  John   Hewett,  G.C.S.I.,  C.I.E.,   who visitedMesopotamia on a special mission last year (Appendix IV.).2. The ultimate area of British occupation in Mesopotamia is not yet decided.The General Staff point out that the size of the garrison to be maintained in Mesopotamia,^nd the consequent cost of military administration, can be reduced (i.) By withdrawal from the vilayet of Mosul and concentration on Baghdad,(ii.) By withdrawal from North Persia.The General Staff are opposed to the idea of withdrawal from the Mosul vilayet,3. The garrison at present consists of some 15,000 British and 50,000 indian troops; its reduction and composition formed the subject of a memorandum already circulated on 1 5th October.   The current cost of this garrison is about 17,000 000/.a year, including the Indian and local labour employed on railway construction, works and other services.4. The expenditure included in the above figure in respect of accommodation,roads and other works services (exclusive of railway construction, see below) is about,350,00(1/. in the current financial year. In addition an expenditure of nearly9,000,000/., spread over ten years, has been proposed for permanent barracks at baghdad (including purchase of land) as to which no decision has yet been taken.(See Appendix II.).The question of land purchase is receiving special and separate consideration.5. The railway policy advocated by the General Staff consists in the constructionof such railway communication as will reduce the number of combatant troops necessary by rendering them more mobile.   The principal schemes are : (i.) The construction of the through metre gauge from Basra to Baghdad,(ii.) The completion of the Kizil Robat Kirkuk Railway to economise thenumber of troops necessary in the North,(iii.) The construction of the railway from Shergat to Qaiyarah to maintain our troops in Mosul.These railways, with the exception of (iii.) (which is purely military), will have aneconomic value, and the question of their transfer to the civil administration must becontemplated.6. The capital expenditure on railways authorized or under construction amounts to1,647,000/. immediately, plus large sums for a number of years, in order to bring theexisting lines up to a reasonable standard of commercial efficiency.It is essential now to lay down limits to the programme of capital expenditure on railway construction in Mesopotamia, and this should be dealt with as a question of civil government finance, and not as a War Office Service, as from 1st April next at the.latest.

APPENDIX I.MEMORANDUM BY THE GENERAL STAFF ONMESOPOTAMIA.121 1. The area of Mesopotamia, including the vilayet of Mosul, is about 150,000 square3     miles, with an estimated population of about two millions.1451    .     A considerable portion of totally unproductive desert is included in the above area,and it has been estimated that an expenditure of &apos;60 or 40 millions on irrigation wouldbe necessary to obtain full economic value from the two great rivers which traverse thecountry.  (Reference may be made to Sir John Hewett&apos;s memorandum for economic ,information, printed as Appendix IV.).As it is unlikely that we should be able to spend this money on the country formany \ears to come, and as the present population is barely sufficient to provide labour for the limited projects at present on hand, other reasons must be sought to justify theretention of this vast area.2. With Palestine, Arabia and Persia, Mesopotamia forms an important link in a chain of contiguous areas under British influence, extending from Egypt to India.It is hoped that in the future this chain will be strengthened by a line of rail andair communications from west to east, as it is considered that this will strengthen ourposition in India which, as our greatest possession in the east, may be likened to a mostvalua1 le appendage at the end of the chain.The probable re-grouping of the Great&apos; Powers in Asiatic Turkey renders it advisable that Great Britain, which will not control the Constantinople Aleppo railwayor the upper wTater of the Euphrates, should have an alternative line of communicationsby land between Europe and India.3. The future motive power of the world is &quot; oil.&quot; The oilfields of Southern Persia,now under British control, are the most inexhaustible &apos;&apos; proved &quot; fields in the world.The Mosul province, and the banks of the middle Euphrates, promise to afford oil in great quantities, although the extent of the fields is not yet proved.With a railway and pipe line to the Mediterranean, which is forecasted within thenext ten years, the position of England as a naval power in the Mediterranean could bwdoubly assured, and our dependence on tlie Suez Canal, which is a vulnerable point it.our line of communications with the east, would be considerably lessened.This, however, is at present little more than a visionary conception of our futureImperial policv, but the recent crossing of the Arabian Desert in a direct lino fromDamascus to Bagdad by a motor car is a positive index to the possibilities of thefuture.4. For the present we are concerned in holding what we have gained at considerable expenditure of effort, blood and treasure, the more so as the province of Mosul, if onlyon account of its oil potentialities, promises to justify all efforts to retain it.Our main difficulty in holding Mesopotamia is the necessity of employing acomparatively small number of white troops to deal with the difficult tribal situations .which are continually arising on the northern frontier, which, owing to the length andinferiority of our communications, is not easily accessible.The only key to the reduction of troops is improvement of communications,particularly those north of Baghdad, and east of the line Baghdad Mosul, where it isimpossible to establish law and order without the presence of troops.At present, owing to transport difficulties and the distances to be covered, it is notpossible to.deal rapidly and effectively with local disturbances in this inaccessiblecountry by sending troops from their permanent stations in the plains, whenever theoccasion demands.Neither is it possible to construct railways to deal with all the local tacticalsituations that might arise.The principal military and civil authorities in Mesopotamia are most strongly ofopinion that it is necessary to occupy these hill districts permanently with troops.The India Office and General Staff support this view.This can only be done by constructing a railway parallel to the disturbed areas,and at no great distance from them, in order to form a base for tactical operations andto ensure a steady and economical supply during the winter.
The General Staff railway programme^ is the most economical which can be designed to satisfy these conditions as well as the future civil requirements.The backbone of this programme is the completion of the through line from Basrato Baghdad, vid the Euphrates.It is admitted that river transport is possible between these two places, but it canbe proved that the railway will more than pay for itself by its superior advantages inspeed and carrying capacity, and that a considerable saving will be effected by doingaway with the cumbersome river flotilla, which, owing to the bends of the river, is many times as long and more t mes as wasteful in coal on account of the strong current.Beyond Baghdad the river lines are not of much use to us, and on the assumptionthat it is necessary to maintain a division and a cavalry brigade in the Mosul area andalong the northern frontier, the proposed railway Baghdad Kizil Robat Kifri Kirkukis the most practicable and economical. The extension towards Mosul along the Tigrisis only a temporary measure as an urgent military necessity.The completion of what used to be known as the Baghdad railway is no longer astrategical advantage to&apos; us. In the event of another Power being on our western flanka railwav which serves our own interests (which do not lie along, the Tigris), with an eventual break of gauge beyond Mosul, would suit us better.As suggested above, if France occupies Northern Syria and the upper Euphratesvalley, our true strategic need is a railway and chain of air bases, or landing grounds,in a direct line between, sav, Haifa in Palestine and Baghdad.6. It has be in suggested that we might hold Mesopotamia with a small compact forcein an entrenched camp near Baghdad and blockhouse posts at other important centres, ariver flotilla, and a good supply of aeroplanes, tanks, armoured cars and othermechanical units.This would be an ideal solution of the man-power difficulty if it were practicable.The arguments against practicability are as follows : (1.) The principal disturbed areas are 200, 300 and 400 miles north of Bagdadrespectively (from Sulaimaniyeh through Ruwanduz to Amadia). Thecountry is mountainous and necessitates hill fighting by properly equippedtroops.(2.) Aeroplanes would require advanced landing grounds to enable them to deal effectively with concentrations of tribesmen. Advanced landing groundsmust be laid out and maintained under the protection of land forces.Bombing is not very effective against scattered tribesmen in hill country.(3.) Withdrawal of troops as far south as Baghdad would lay the plains betweenBaghdad and Mosul open to invasion by the Kurds and hostile Arab tribes.In the event of a general Mahommedan rising an entrenched camp at baghdad might easily become another Kut. It must be remembered that aconcentrated force at Baghdad, without a strongly guarded line of communications, would be in a dangerous position, as some of the mostfanatical tribes are situated behind our front (for example, at Nasariyah).(4.) The country is unsuitable for the employment of tanks owing to the sand and lack of hard surfaces. Heavy armoured cars, and all kinds of mechanical transport, are at a disadvantage. Beyond the sand areas the few roads tothe hill country are impassable during and after the rains, which are heavyalong the whole northern frontier.(5.) The value of existing river communications is limited, from the point of viewof a military occupation of the country north of Baghdad. The Tigris is too far from the main disturbed areas. Its windings are so intricate that theycannot be shown on a small scale map, and owing to the powerful currentthe employment of flotillas would be extravagant, even if through navigationwere pussible at low water.7. The above lessons have been learnt by experience during the late campaign. Itis hard to visualize the enormous distances and transport difficulties.Our goal at Mosul was reached only by superhuman efforts of endurance on thepart of both British and Indian troops.Instead of the Turk, we now have to reckon with a fanatical and generallydissatisfied population in Mesopotamia itself, and a northern frontier situation which fortribal unrest can only be likened to that of India.* See Memorandum on Railway Policy in Mesopotamia, by the General Staff, Appeudix III.(7524) a 2
APPJENDIX II.EXTRACT FROM A GENERAL STAFF PAPER ON MESO-POTAMIAN GARRISONS, TOGETHER WITH FINANCIALREMARKS.1. Peesent Gaeeison. \1. The garrison has now been reduced, as regards British troops, practically to thenumbers laid down for the &quot;after-war&quot; army. These number approximately 15,000men. There are also about 50,000 Indians, in addition to large numbers of Indian andlocal labour personnel who will be gradually reduced.The organization is as follows : &apos; 2 Indian Divisions (each having 2 squadrons of cavalry, and 2 companies, Machine Gun Corps).1 Indian Cavalry Brigade.... ^ 1 British Cavalry Regiment.2 Indian Cavalry Regiments.1 Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (which might be withdrawn later),j 1 Indian Mixed Brigade.&quot;&apos; [Lines of Communication Troops.This garrison is the lowest possible to maintain order.The General Officer Commanding recently asked for extra Indian battalions for thelines of communication.The bulk of these troops would normally be concentrated at Mosul and Baghdadand between these two places.2. The inclusion of the commercially valuable Mosul vilayet in Mesopotamia consider-ablv enlarges our military responsibilities, as the northern frontier of this province is ina chronic state of disturbance, and military operations in that area have been continuallynecessary since the beginning of that year.Moreover, communications between Mosul and Baghdad are very bad, so that thetroops cannot be concentrated at or near Baghdad, otherwise a reduction might havebeen possible in the present garrison.Gendarmerie is being organized, which, under British officers, might in time takeover the policing of the turbulent northern frontier of the Mosul vilayet and also the tribes in the Sulaimaniyeh area, but it will be a long time before native levies can takethe place of British or Indian troops.3. In the opinion of the General Staff no reduction in the permanent garrison ofMesopotamia can be made at present unless (i.) We withdraw from the Mosul vilayet and concentrate on Baghdad; or,(ii.) We withdraw the force in North Persia, which requires some 1,600 british personnel for administrative services.If (i) were agreed to, it might be possible to do away with one Indian division andone cavalry brigade, but we should obviously lose important strategical advantages and the political fruits of our victories.If ii) were agreed to, a mixed Indian brigade would be saved, which includes1,600 British. This brigade is now retained for poiical purposes in Persia rather than for fighting purposes, and the British representative at Teheran has recently statedthat its retention will be necessary until the new Persian force is efficiently formed.The reductions suggested in (i) and (ii) above would decrease the total number ofBritish in Mesopotamia to approximately 10,000 men, but it would, be at the expenseof abandoning the Mosul vilayet, and practically bringing our truculent neighbours theKurds within reach of Baghdad.Such a course would seriously prejudice the future political economic developmentof the country, and is greatly to be deprecated.Mesopotamia ...North Persia ...
4. It may be noted here that an increase in the number of aeroplanes allotted to thepost-war garrison would not materially decrease the number of troops required, as inthe present state of development of thy Air Service they have not a sufficiently wide range of action to be independent of advanced landing grounds, repair shops and roadsfit for heavy motor transport. Long-range bombing machines are not vet adapted for ahot country, nor can advanced landing grounds be laid out and maintained withoutpermanent occupation by troops.2. Reinforcements.-5. It is considered that the normal garrison outlined above should, if well supplied with aeroplanes, and if the present railway programme^ is carried out, be able to dealwith atiy local situation that might arise in the near future. &quot;If, however, an Arab rising broke out on a great scale, being part of a holy warthroughout all the Middle East, British reinforcements would be required from home, asnone would in such circumstances be available from India or Egypt. Moreover, theIndian troops of the Mesopotamian garrison might, in this case, become unreliable.It is considered that, in the latter circumstances, the following reinforcementswould be the minimum if we wish to retain Baghdad against a combination of Arabs andKurds :  *3 British divisions.3 British cavalry brigades.These should be concentrated near Basra within six weeks of the outbreak of war.Remarks by the Finance Department.6. The cost of the garrison shown in paragraph 1 is about 17,000,000/. a-year.This figure includes the Indian and local labour employed on railway construction,works and other services. The cost included for the temporary accommodation, roads, &amp;c,already in progress or contemplated in the current financial year is approximately2,100,000/., including 963,000/. for &quot;maintenance,&quot; which includes such services asupkeep of roads, water supply, electric light and ice supply. In addition, the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief has asked for 250,000/., to meet other as yet undefinedneeds during the current financial year. For this last sum no special provision hasbeen made in the revised total of Army Estimates.7. If the policy is adopted of building permanent cantonments at Baghdad, afurther&apos; cost (including 632,000/. for purchase of land) is involved of 1,(532,000/.immediately and 7,250,000/. spread over about 10 years. In addition there is the costof maintenance.8. This permanent accommodation at Baghdad is only designed to accommodateabout half the proposed garrison. If it is necessary to accommodate the whole garrison in permanent barracks the estimate will be increased. In any event, some expenditurein future years, beyond the works already in progress, will no doubt be necessary, butit is not known how far a reduction in the garrison, with its consequently altereddistribution, would affect the building programme.9. A separate investigation of the land purchase question is urgently necessary.There are indications of a sharp rise in the price of land selected, and it has been statedin the Press that this is due to speculators buying for resale to the Government, it isnot known what powers the Government possesses to take land in the Baghdad districtat a &quot; fair&quot; price. Temporary building is proceeding on land that has not yet been acquired by the War Department.* See Memorandum by tha General Staff on Railway Policy in Mesopotamia, printed as Appendix III.
APPENDIX III.RAILWAY POLICY IN MESOPOTAMIA TOGETHER with financial REMARKS.Memorandum by the General Staff.121 1. The policy of the Government is to reduce the forces in Mesopotamia to the3      utmost possible extent at the earliest possible moment consistent with reasonablesecurity.2. The chief difficulties in carrying out this policy at the present time are (i.) The extent of the country to be policed, the number of arms in possession ofthe inhabitants and the absence of an effective civil administration.(ii.) The disturbed state of the country on the North and North-Eastern frontiers.(iii.) Jjack of communications, both load and rail, particularly in the northern partof the province.(iv.) The patchwork nature of the lines of communications from Basra to Baghdad,consisting of two incomplete systems, one up the Euphrates and one up the tigris, and necessitating frequent transhipment and consequent waste of&quot;time and labour. &apos;The primary necessities then are the simplification of existing communications to economize labour, and the extension of rail communications into the north ofthe province to economize transport personnel and to reduce the number of combatanttroops necessary by rendering them more mobile.3. The following are the Railway, schemes in. accordance with decisions of aConference, which has met under Lord Curzons presidency during this year, and onwhich the Treasury, India Office and War Office are represented. Treasury sanction,has been obtained where necessary for the first three schemes, and will presumably besought for the fourth : &quot;A.&quot; Through metre gauge from Basra to Baghdad, via Nasariyah, Samawa andITillah. In order to simplify communications and economize labour, it has been decidedto abandon the Tigris line and concentrate on the Euphrates line. At present this latterline of communication comprises three sections (a) Basra Samawa (metre gauge),this has been completed; (b) Samawa Hillah (incomplete, metre gauge, this is nowunder construction as a charge on this years Army Funds; (c) Hillah Baghdad,(standard gauge), this has been completed.The imentjon is to complete the line on metre gauge and so save two breaks ofbulk. - It is estimated that in two or three months the cost of conversion of the Hillah Baghdad line will be saved in transhipment charges and economy of working, whilstas soon as through connection is opened the whole Tigris line of communication can.be closed down and the Inland Water Transport fleet demobilized.Permanent way can be obtained by pulling up the Basra Amarah line. It isestimated that through working from Basrah to Baghdad can be commenced byJanuary, 1920, but the works would not be completed to a permanent, workingstandard till considerably later. The line will then form a valuable commercial andmilitary asset.&quot; B.&quot; Metre gauge from Baghdad to Quraitu on the Persian frontier. Asregards the extension of railway communications north of Baghdad, the metre gaugefrom Baghdad to the Persian frontier at Quraitu is open for traffic, though considerable expenditure is still necessary on buildings and other essential accessories, necessary tobring the railway up to commercial standards.&quot;C.&quot; Extension of the i-ft. 8^-in^ gauge from Shuraimiyah up the right bank ofthe Tigris to Shergat; thence the construction of a line to Qaiyarah, It is not our policy to extend the 4-f&apos;t. 8^-in. standard gauge up the Tigris north of Baghdad, moreparticularly since it is proposed that the rest of the Mesopotamian system should bemetre gauge. Owing, however, to the urgent necessity of maintaining our troops in theMosul Vilayet and so as to reduce motor transport, now working under mostuneconomical conditions, the Treasury sanctioned the extension of the line to Mosul andthe standard gauge has been pushed on to Shergat (about 70 miles from Mosul), material
being obtained by dismantling the Baghdad Bhibban line. Pending a decision on thewhole question of railway policy, no action is being taken as regards&apos; the extension toQaiyaraii (about 40 miles from Mosul), which is a temporary necessity.&quot; D.&quot; Metre gauge (branching from the Baghdad Quraitu line) from KizilRobot to Kirkuk (eventually to Mosul). The recent unrest in Kurdistan necessitated the occupation of Sulaimaniyeh. Here and in the country north of Mosul, owingto transport difficulties, it is not possible .to deal rapidly and effectively with local disturbances. The principal military and civil authorities in Mesopotamiaadvocate the permanent occupation of Sulaimaniyeh, and the India Office and-General Staff support this view. The Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, points outthat if we withdraw from Sulaimaniyeh a larger force will have to be maintained atKirkuk, Kifri and Erbil. The construction of this railway will ensure a steady and economical channel of supply, and the railway running, parallel to the disturbed areas will form a base for operations. The Chief Political Officer, Baghdad, also considersthat this railway would be economically advantageous.The General Officer Commanding has, with the 25 miles recently supplied from india, sufficient track material to reach Kifri. 24 miles of earthwork and 20 miles ofplatelaying were completed by the 11th October. For further extension towardsKirkuk it was proposed to despatch about 40 miles from France, which would carryrailhead to a point midway between Kifri and Kirkuk. For further extension toKirkuk and beyond General Officer Commanding would have to await dismantlingof the Kut Baghdad line. No action has yet been taken in supplying the 40 milesfrom France.*4. To sum un.   What the General Staff advocate is JL(i.) The construction of the through  metre-gauge railway from Basra toBaghdad (project &quot; A.&quot; above) net to be interfered with owing to theconstruction of the lines to Kirkuk and Qaiyarah.(ii.) The completion of the Kizil Robat Kirkuk railway (project &quot; D &quot; above)whereby economy can be effected in the number of troops necessary tomaintain order in that district,(iii.) The construction of the railway from Shergat to Qaiyarah (project &quot; C &quot;above) for reasons already stated.The completion of projects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; with the existing metre gauge railway from Baghdad to Quraitu (project &quot; B&quot;) would give through communication by metregauge from Basra to Baghdad and thence to the North-Eastern and Northern frontiers of Mesopotamia.Judging from the experience of similar conditions on the Indian frontier, the-construction of such a railway is an essential condition for security combined witheconomy of force.Remarks bv the Finance Department.5. For the present and future financial years the latest figures for expenditure are : - 1919-20 &quot; A.&quot;-Basra-Baghdad      ...      ......... 605,500&quot; B.&quot;-Baghdad-Quraitu   ............ 191,000&quot; C.&quot;-Shuraimiyah Qaivarah      ...      ...      ... 306,800&quot; D.&quot;-Kizil Robat-Kirkuk............ 495,700Miscellaneous other than above ,     ...      ...      ... 48,000Total      .........   1,647,000*For future years it is estimated that in 1920-21 (excluding continued construction-of &quot; D.,&quot; fur which no figures are yet available) 630,000/. will be required, and thereafter500,000/. annually for some years for accessories necessary for commercial operations.6. In accordance with a decision of the Government last spring, the cost of theseservices1 has continued to be borne entirely on Army Votes, although since theArmistice the future civil needs of the country have no doubt been kept in view in considering the several proposals. But the Mesopotamian railway system, both con-struction and running, must obviously pass to the Civil Administration, and the soonerthe better.   The War Office, in building new lines primarily for military needs, has* This total does not include the value of material available in Mesopotamia or being sent from France-or England.
necessarily limited its expenditure to the bare minimum requisite for present militarytraffic. The capital expenditure now required for further extension or for accessoriesessential for commercial operation cannot be found out of the limited total to be placed at the disposal of the War Office for Army needs in 1920-21, nor could the WarOffice efficiently control such expenditure.7. In these circumstances it is desirable that the railway system generally, withthe capital works now in progress, should be turned over as a going concern to thepresent civil authorities at the earliest possible date, say 1st January next. Thetransfer would be subject to the use of the lines (on payment at rates to be agreed) bythe military authorities, and without prejudice to the question what, and when, theCivil Government ought to pay on account of the capital value of the system as it stands when taken over. On this last question the Civil Commissioner, in a recentdespatch, has remarked as follows : &quot;With regard to the capital expenditure (on railways) which, up to date, isbelieved to represent some 12,000,000/.,* it is obvious that the revenues ofMesopotamia cannot at present bear so heavy a charge as the interest andredemption of this sum would involve. The railway is unlikely to pay its way for some years to come. The difficulty would not arise if the railways were taken over by a Company, but I understand that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare at present not in favour of that course.&quot;* The War Office cannot vouch for the figure.
APPENDIX IV. vv\o.12131451MEMORANDUM ON MESOPOTAMIA BY SIR JOHN HEWETT,DATED 7th MAY, 1919.The area of the two vilayets of Basra and Baghdad is about 108,000 square miles. The extent of the country, including the Mosul vilayet (42,000 square miles),is 150,000 square miles. The population of the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad hasnot been taken by a regular census. Endeavours are now being made to obtain an approximate estimate of it. Judging from the information available, it may be assumed to be between 1,500,000 and 1,800,000. Even if it approximates to the latter figureafter adding the population of Mosul, estimated at about 250,000, a total is reached of only 2,000,000. The area is thus about that of a large province in India. Thepopulation is far below that of the smallest province there.It was hoped that about 2,000,000 acres of land would come under cultivation in1919, The forecast of the Irrigation Department is that 1,320,000 acres are likely tobe harvested this year. My own opinion for what it is worth is that the areacultivated was above 1,500,000 but under 2,000,000 acres. The development of thecountry depends on the extension of irrigation, and the provision of a populationadequate to cultivate the land commanded by water. Sir William Willcocksestimated that an area of 7,000,000 acres of wheat and barley could be irrigated fromthe waters of the Tigris and Euphrates. In addition, 1,000,000 acres of rice and3,000,000 acres of millet, &amp;c, could be cultivated. Thus, from the point of view of its existing population, and of the area likely to come under cultivation in the near future,Mesopotamia (the term being used to designate the three vilayets of Basra, Baghdadand Mosul) is a comparatively small country.It is essentially an agricultural country. Outside oil, its mineral resources appearto be insignificant. The possibilities of its development seem to be in the productionof cereals, oilseeds, cotton, beet and fruit, in the manufacture of sugar from beet, andin the breeding of sheep and, possibly later on, cattle.The Reverend G. F. Marson, described as, until recently, a chaplain with our forces,in the East, lecturing at the iEolian Hall on 17th March, is reported by the newspapers-to have said that it was considered that the country had increased so much in value that the revenues of Mesopotamia might be expected to repay within five years the cost of the expedition sent there, and that&apos; the area north of Baghdad ought tobecome the greatest cotton-producing tract in the world. It is a pity that suchexaggerated estimates of the future of Mesopotamia should be given in public. Thecountry should have a great future, but it is not likely to become an El Dorado at once.I could not obtain the figures for the budget of the current year, but understood thatthe revenue was estimated to be 2,-000,000 sterling. If that is really the estimate, itseems to be a conservative one.The first impression which one gains on a visit to Mesopotamia is that the country- -side is remarkably quiet. The population has in its possession large quantities of amis,,but the carrying of arms is discouraged. One sees no one going armed, and over widetracts there is no sign of a soldier of our own army. One might have imagined that,in a country where life is valued very cheaply and lawlessness has always been rife,there would have been a number of instances of assassination on political and similargrounds. These have been wonderfully rare, and none at all, I believe, for many months.It may be that when the size of the army is reduced, as is proposed, to two divisions and two cavalry brigades, breaches of law and order may become more numerous. But, on the surface at all events, the Arab appears to be pleased that it isno longer necessary for him to go armed. And a good system of village police underthe control of the headman, and of armed police drilled to a high state of discipline andstationed at centres from which they can be readily despatched to deal with local,troubles, should enable law and order to be maintained effectively in the more settledtracts. Among the nomad tribes the Sheikhs will no doubt, subject to the control ofthe political officers, be vested with a considerable measure of authority.The quiet of the countryside is emphasized by the absence of the villages, and the enormous areas of land of very fertile character which lie untouched by the plough.
Old canals and water channels, stretching in every direction, exist all over the country,and there are signs of former cultivation everywhere. One realizes at once that thecountry is a very fertile one which has net for a long time given the fruits of the earthto anything like the extent to which it should have. In many places the nomad campson the banks of the river are the only signs of the country being inhabited.Another physical feature which impresses itself on one every mile one goes is the extraordinary absence of trees, other than date palms and fruit trees in small orchardsround fixed habitations. Both sides &quot;of the Shatt-el-Arab, as one approaches Basra,are covered with the most magnificent areas of date palms. As one proceeds norththey are limited to the surroundings of the occupied villages, till eventually the datepalm comes to an end at Tekrit, where there is a small family of three trees.The date palms are said to number over ten millions, and are a most essential feature in the wealth of the country. Oranges, grapes, peaches, apricots, plums,greengages, mulberries, figs and pomegranates grow well, and there are a few indifferentapples. Willows, on the foreshore of the Euphrates, and in other places where theyhave been able to grow, owing to the dampness in the soil, are almost the only othertrees which one sees anywhere. The shortness of fuel willows are burned forcharcoal is very marked, and the greater portion of the population depends for itsfuel supplies on the camel thorn, which grows in profusion in most places.The main obstacle to the early development of Mesopotamia is undoubtedly theshortness of the population. Although there is a certain amount of unirrigated cultiva-tion every year, and the amount of land sown but unprotected by irrigation is veryconsiderable in a year where the rainfall has been so propitious as it has this year; it isfair to say, of the Basra and Baghdad vilayets generally, that irrigation is an absolute,necessity, not merely an advantage, in production. The ability to develop irrigation is limited by the amount of labour available (1) to dig the canals and (2) to cultivate thenew lands which such canals can irrigate. The present Civil Commissioner is of opinionthat the area now under cultivation is nearly as much as the existing population candeal with by existing methods. It is the opinion of all the most experienced officers ofthe civil administration whom he has consulted that the policy of the administrationfor some years after the war should be to endeavour through the AgriculturalDepartment to improve the quality of the crops grown, and the yield per acre, and incertain cases to improve the local methods of cultivation rather than to seek to open upfresh areas. That there is immense scope for improvement in the methods of cultivationis indisputable ; and it is the fact that, while the area under crop at the presentmoment is much higher than it has ever been, there are areas now commanded bycanals which have not been cultivated this winter. There is then no advantage in pressing on large schemes such as have been suggested for the irrigation of the country without first looking round to see whether, if more canals are constructed, the landirrigated by them can be cultivated.There is a very interesting article by Miss Gertrude Bell on land and labour inMesopotamia, printed as Appendix VI. to the report by Messrs. Holland and Wilson,on the prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. At a meetingof the Royal Geographical Society on 15th November, 1909, at which Sir WilliamWillcock&apos;s projects for irrigation in Mesopotamia were discussed, Miss Bell remarked :&quot;It is difficult to overestimate the mobility of labour in Oriental countries. Thispoints to an economic condition in the Turkish Empire which it is important to bear inmind ; everybody is short of a job. I am inclined to believe that the momentSir William begins his work, he will find labour coming to him in great quantities, andfrom very distant parts of the Empire. The rumour of a fixed wage will speedilybring people to Mesopotamia and, as the land comes into cultivation, that which is notoccupied by the local population will be taken up by these immigrants.&quot; Such a movement could not be expected on a scale of any size except in peace time, and miss Bell, writing in February, 1917. felt that &quot;when all local sources of supply havebeen taken into account it is unlikely that the amount of labour available in theimmediate future will be abundant.&quot; Miss Bell insisted on the need for regarding thelabour question in Mesopotamia from the political as well as the economic standpoint.This aspect of the case cannot be neglected, though it seems possible that it mightclaim too much attention. Outside the Government land the tribal Sheikhs^ seem to claim a right in the land whether cultivated or uncultivated. If a marsh is drained,or some deserted land comes under the command of a new irrigation channel, a claimantto the land seems to appear at once from somewhere. Considering the relatively small amount of land now under cultivation compared to what might be cultivated were theschemes of Sir William Willcocks or some similar projects carried into effect, it is
difficult to imagine that the State in Mesopotamia, whatever it might be, would admit&apos;so promiscuous a claim. But the existence of a cultivating community, consistingentirely of Shias, constitutes a formidable bar, in the interests of peace and quiet, tothe introduction of colonists belonging, in Miss Belfs words, &quot; to an alien and non-absorbable civilization.&quot; This consideration seems to exclude the idea of any generalimmigration of Indians as cultivators, though every Indian who sees the land, enviesits fertility. The Mahommedan cultivator from India is just as undesirable as the hindu. He is usully a Sunni, and religious difference between Shias and Sunnis are apt to develop, as experience at Lucknow and elsewhere proves, into hostility as acute asthat which is found between the Musalman and the Hindu. Were the area commandedby canals in Mesopotamia largely extended, Persians might be attracted to cultivateit, but the population of Northern Persia is sadly reduced, and little aid could comeexcept from Southern Persia for a long time. Any appreciable influx of Mahommedanimmigrants from beyond the seas seems at least uncertain. The Sudan needs all its population ; Egypt could spare large numbers. The Arab in Egypt has, I believe, beensingularly tenacious of his home when attempts have been made to induce him to movecomparatively short distances, but this may not mean that he would not be ready&apos;to cross the seas were prospects sufficiently attractive. Mesopotamia seems to be a country which the Egyptian might be expected to like.The Director of Labour has favoured me with some very interesting remarks on thepossibilities of local labour in Mesopotamia, which are attached (page 24). I understandthat the present Civil Commissioner estimates the amount of labour available for publicworks of different kinds at about 30,000. At the beginning of March the number of arabs employed on labour, including 10,000 in the Mosul vilayet, where special measures had to be taken to employ some of the city population owing to local scarcity,was 39,415. This number will be rapidly reduced as soon as men become needed foragricultural operations. The rains had been so favourable for agriculture till thebeginning of March that very little labour had been needed for irrigation of the crop.The greatest employer of labour is the Irrigation Department. It has during the past year never had anything like as much Arab labour as imported labour. At thebeginning of March it had only 1,950 Arabs working in a force of 15,800. A large amount of flood protection has had to be done on the Tigris this winter. Out of 6,570employed on this work only 300 Arabs could be collected. I have myself seenembankments being constructed on the Tigris between Amarah and Kut without anyArabs at all working on them. Vessels are loaded and discharged at the port ofBasra almost entirely by imported labour. The figures^ from the port showinghow the different classes employed there have worked are interesting as showinghow imported labour has to be relied on for this purpose. It is difficult to see how Mesopotamia is going to get on in peace time without imported labour in suchmatters as irrigation, railway construction, other public works and the work of theport of Basra.So far as agriculture is concerned the shortness of labour may be neutralized to-some extent by the introduction of agricultural machinery. Mesopotamia is, indeed,not so favourable a country for the use of tractors and harvesters as Arabistan is, as itis much cut up by water channels. But in spite of this, it offers considerable scope forthe utilization of all kinds of agricultural labour-saving processes, and the moreintelligent Arab is keenly alive to the advantages of adopting such processes.But other measures are necessary if the country is to progress as it ought to do.The doctrine of the survival of the fittest is well exemplified in the population ofMesopotamia. The Arabs who grow up, male and female, are a strong sturdy race thoughsyphilis is prevalent. The women are healthy and prolific. In the absence of vital statistics,reliable figures are unobtainable. But.medical opinion calculates that there is a birthrate of about 26 per mille, that 12 to 15 per cent, of the children born die before theyare a month old, and another 50 per cent, within the year. The death rate amongchildren between birth and 15 years of age is thought to be as high as 75 per cent.The greatest need of Mesopotamia is an efficient civil medical service. Its functionshould be to improve the general health of the population and to raise the standard ofhealth and physique. A rapid increase of the population should accompany the growingprosperity of the country, and the working capacity per head of the population is certain to increase as the result of improvement in the personal health of the individual.One error to be avoided in the creation of such a service is the unnecessary multiplica-tion of administrative officers. No scheme is likely to succeed which does not dependin the first instance on the keenness of those directly in contact with the people whom(7524)* Appendix E, page 27, shows this best.
It is designed to benefit, and the introduction of any machinery calculated to checkinitiative or to cause obstruction and delay is to be deprecated. The civil surgeonsshould be chosen for their wide experience in medicine and surgery ; their efficiency willbe much enhanced by a knowledge of bacteriology; the influence will depend on theircharacter and personality. To induce good men to join the service the conditions ofemployment in it must be made attractive. Any rule restricting private practice islikely to discourage men from joining -it. r.l here seems to be great work for ladymedical officers. The Arab seems very keen to get advice of a good doctor. They seemquite ready to go to hospitals under the charge of British officers and are not reluctant to submit to operations. 1 have seen them, men and women, thronging the dispensaryof an Indian bub-Assistant Surgeon in whose advice they had reason to feel confidence.The health of the outlying communities, of the tribes on the river banks, and of thepopulation in the desert could be provided for by a system of travelling dispensaries inspecially equipped motor ambulances and motor launches. The popularity achieved bytravelling dispensaries in India leads one to feel sure that they would be muchappreciated in Mesopotamia. Special attention is required for the treatment, both instationary hospitals and in peripatetic dispensaries, of eye diseases, which aredistressingly prevalent.Medical officers of health will be necessary in the large towns who should haveunder them medical inspectors, sanitary inspectors and women inspectors, whose specialcharge would be the improvement of infant hygiene, The employment of trainedBritish women would be an experiment, and it seems certain that their help would be appreciated, and that they would be able to give most valuable assistance.These matters have no doubt already received consideration at the hands of thecivil authorities, and these very general suggestions are not made with the idea thatthere is any originality about them, but with the conviction that the creation of a medical organization designed to provide as far as possible for the effective treatment ofthe sick, and to raise, with as little delay as possible, the general standard of hygieneand comfort, is the first and most important problem which demands settlement fromthe point of view of the Arab population of Mesopotamia.The great difference between Egypt and Mesopotamia is that in the former countrywater is most abundant in the Nile during the summer weather, whereas the floodscome in Mesopotamia in the winter and spring, the rivers being at their lowest in the summer and autumn. Therefore, white r gypt depends mainly on cotton and other hotweather crops, Mesopotamia depends in large degree, and will continue to depend on the cereals produced by the crops sown in the autumn and winter, and reaped in the early summer. Water for irrigation being chiefly available during the months favourable forthe growth of wheat and barley, these two staples are the main crops of Mesopotamia.Barley is the more prevalent crop in the lower part of the country. The proportion ofwheat on the Euphrates increases in Ramadi and Hit, and west of the latter place little or no barley is cultivated. In the Basra and Baghdad vilayets the amount of barleyto wheat was recently calculated at about 9 to 1. In the vilayet of Mosul wheat is amuch more common crop than barley. A very good macaroni wheat is grown in theneighbourhood of Kirkuk, Alton-Kurri, Erbil and Mosul itself; practically it may be described as unirrigated. In the Karun Valley in Arabistan, whence grain for exportgoes to Basra, there is very little irrigation, The proportion of wheat to barleythere is 2 to 1. Some of the wheat is of an excellent quality. In 1908 the exportof grain from Basra amounted to 126,000 tons, in 1909 to 36,000 tons, in 1910 to 64,000tons, in 1911 to 148,000, and in 1912 to 231,000. In 1911-12, 92,700 tons of grainwere exported from Basra to London, and 63,300 to Hamburg and Antwerp. In1912-13 there was a bad harvest, and the exports fell 20,350 tons for London and4,800 tons for the other two ports; mostly barley, some rice, paddy and seeds. Thetrade has naturally died during the war, but this year there should be a great deal of grain for export. The difficulty this summer will be to lift the crop, both inMesopotamia and in Arabistan. Prices in both places are at the moment very much onthe downward grade, having been for some time at an artificial height.The Arab cultivator is the worst of whom I have had any experience. The Indianraiyat as a rule does not cultivate to a high standard of efficiency, but he is far ahead of the Arab. He has to work to get his land to yield him a good return. T(heArab in Mesopotamia and Arabistan has not. Colonel Evans, the Director ofAgriculture in Mesopotamia, has examined a large number of samples of both wheat and barley from all parts of the country, and has no hesitation in saying that they arethe worst commercial samples he has ever seen. The chief fault which he findsis that wheat and barley, as at present produced, are too mixed to be of real value.
He has found that a sample of wheat will often contain so much barley that it isdifficult to judge on first inspection whether it could be more accurately described as a-dirty sample of wheat or a dirty sample of barley. It was this defect which led to thearmy ceasing this year to buy wheat produced under ihe agricultural development scheme. The purchase of wheat was not allowed if it contained over 17-g- per cent, of barley. It was found impossible to get wheat of this purity, and when the figure was raised to 25 per cent, it was still not found feasible to make satisfactory purchases. Inaddition to the excessive amount of barley in the, wheat, samples are usually foundcontaminated with the seeds of the wild oat and other, weeds, and often contain a high proportion of dirt. Weeds are not common in the winter in Mesopotamia andsystematic weeding is not practised. In Arabistan the wheat-fields are full of suchgrowths as mallow and a kind of charlock, and no attempt seems to be made toextirpate them. Apparently the hot sun during the ripening of the crop kills them.The miller does not want to find barley or wild oats in his wheat, nor the distiller tofind wheat in his barley. There is another serious fault, in that different varieties ofwheat and barley are too much mixed. The miller will want one kind of wheat and thedistiller one type of barley. Colonel Evans finds that in the best of the samples five or six different types can always be picked out. They would include hard and softgrains, grains of different colours, and would vary in shape and size. The haphazardsystem of cultivation being largely responsible for these results, the remedy to besought is the means of improving the methods of the grower. His practice is to sowthe seed first and to plough it after irrigation. The land may have been cropped withbarley in the previous year and much spent grain be in it. This is ploughed under withthe wheat seed sown, and naturally a mixed crop results. It is easy to remedy this. Ifthe laud is irrigated so that the barley and wild oats dormant in the soil germinate andare then ploughed under, a clean seedbed on which the pure seed can be sown will result. The Agricultural Department, ui..der the direction of Colonel Evans, has issuedleaflets in Arabic explaining this to the cultivator. It is also endeavouring to ascertain what types of wheat and barley are likely to find the best markets, and is testing byexperiment what varieties are likely to give the biggest yields. An improvementought then to be speedily effected But the grain produced from the crop now on the land will necessarily be very mixed and very dirty. Colonel Evans&apos; testimony gives very strong support to the contention of the Civil Commissioner that there is plenty of workfor the Agricultural Department to do in improving the local methods of cultivation,bettering the quality of the crops grown and raising the yield per acre. This all points to the need for a strong and efficient Agricultural Department, a matter which will bereturned to later. Improved methods of cultivation should certainly lead to increasedout-turn. When he prepared his scheme of agricultural development in 1918, Mr. Garbett,then First Revenue Officer, calculated that the out-turn of the harvest should be f ths ofa ton per acre for barley and ^ of a ton for wheat. Our conclusions in respect of the out-turn of the harvest produced under the scheme in 1917 were that the area under cropwas from 550,000 to 600,000 acres, and the produce from 1*60,000 to 300,000 tons. the out-turn was according to these calculations, less per acre than Mr. Garbett had anticipated. In the estimate framed by Mr. Ward, Inspector-General of Irrigation inIndia, of the prospects of the crop now on the ground he took the out-turn of wheat and barley at an all round figure of fths of a ton per acre. When I saw Mr. Garbett inDecember last he appeared to favour this figure. According to our calculations of theresults of the 1918 harvest it would be an under-estimate. It represents 840 lbs. anacre. This seems a very low figure for irrigated wheat and barley, considering that the soil of Mesopotamia is of such excellent quality.In the statistical tables for the out-turn of wheat the standard of out-turn in india is taken as 12&apos;8 bushels (100) = 768 lbs. But a large amount of the wheat produced in India is not irrigated. Mr. Moreland, late Director of Agriculture in the united provinces, in his work on &quot; The Agriculture of the United Provinces&quot; (p. 203) writesthat the out-turn of irrigated wheat in those provinces averages 1,200 lbs. or more to theacre. Mr. Morrison, at one time Inspector-General of Agriculture in India, referring tothe cultivation of wheat in certain parts of the Bombay Presidency, estimated that agood irrigated crop of wheat might give 2,000 lbs. of grain, and over a ton of strawper acre, and a good dry crop 1,000 lbs of grain and the same weight of straw. the out-turn of barley would be rather higher than that of wheat, but there is much huskand less barley than wheat is watered. The average would, of course, be lower thanthese figures, but they are sufficient to show that there is a great margin for improve-ment in the out-turn of wheat and barley in Mesopotamia.In paragraph 36 of their report, the Trade Commissioners write: &quot;but our^greatest hopes for the future of Mesopotamia are founded upon its possibilities as a

It is undoubtedly sown there on much bad and unsuitableland. There are thus great variations ; 150 to 200 lbs. would probably be regarded asa fair return. Experiments in the Sudan give, I understand, something like 250 lbs. anacre. But for the figures of Mr. Thomas&apos; experiments being undoubtedly authentic,they might appear to be fabulous. While it would not do to generalize toO much from them, they can certainly be regarded as proving that a good long-stapled cotton can begrown in Mesopotamia. In Egypt cotton is sown between the middle of February andthe middle of April. The first picking in upper Egypt is in August, and in the Deltain September. Dr. Goulding says, &quot; the last pickings Nare picked in November.&quot; Atthe beginning of November, 1918, there was very little left on the ground.In Mesopotamia sowings should be finished by the middle of April, but the weatheris too cold to enable them to be begun.as early as in Egypt. Seed will not do muchmore than germinate in March. Frost may be expected in Baghdad by the beginningof December. The crop must mature without the hot moist atmosphere which is sobeneficial to it in Lower Egypt, The bollworm is a serious pest but the only one yetencountered. The problem of the selection of the best variety of cotton for differenttracts has to be solved. On lands commanded by perennial irrigation from the canalstaking off from the Hindiyah Barrage and the Digalah, as well as on lands supplied with water by pumps on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, it might be possible tocultivate cotton of a very good quality at a considerable profit provided that twodifficulties can be overcome. The first is the inferiority of the Arab as a cultivator.He must develop much more interest and energy in the labours of the field than he has yet displayed if he is to make a success of the cultivation of cotton. The secondtrouble ahead is the difficulty of collecting hands to do the picking of the cotton. InEgypt, with its narrow strip of cultivation and its abundant population, the fellahwho wishes his cotton picked has only to hold up his hand to get as much labour as hecotton producing country.&quot; And, in accordance with their suggestion, an expert in the&apos;Indian Agricultural Service, Mr. i\. Thomas, B.S.C., was sent to conduct experimentswith varieties of Egyptian, American and Indian seed. These experiments were, owingto the short time available to Mr. Thomas for making his arrangements, confined toone plantation in the neighbourhood of Baghdad instead of being, as the Commissionersrecommended, undertaken in different localities. The results are extremely interesting.It must not be forgotten that the land was specially fertile, the soil being a sandy loamwith good natural drainage, but uncultivated for the previous three years. The numberof waterings given was 17. Ten are given in Egypt and 12 in the Sudan. ColonelEvans considers that the plants were over-watered, and that 10 waterings would havebeen sufficient. The late arrival of some of the imported seed depreciated the value ofsome of the tests. The plants were withered by two frosts early in December. When Isaw the plantation on 18th December I was much struck by the very large number ofbolls in some of the plots which had, while still immature, been destroyed by the frost.The results of Mr. Thomas&apos; experiments are astonishing ; in considering them it isdesirable to remember that it is highly probable that the returns would be appreciablyless on land representative of the average iraq soils, irrigable by direct flow. The plotswere y-0-th of an. acre in size, the figures have been calculated to the acre yield fromthese,plots.   The best results were the following : 
:needs. In Mesopotamia this difficulty will not be easy to overcome. Something might perhaps be done by organizing at centres of population labour corps of children, who might go picking from place to place under proper supervision. Arab children are veryintelligent and would do the picking very well.Tt has been suggested that Mesopotamia might be suitable for the cultivation of sugar cane on a large scale. The soil is probably suitable, but other factors which haveto be considered, at all events in the Baghdad and Mosul vilayets, are not so encouraging.Cane requires a long period of growth. In the united provinces the area under caneis about 1,250,000 acres half the area under cane in India. It is sown in february and March, and the thicker and softer varieties do not ripen at a place like Bareilly,which is a great cane centre, till the following February.I have been District Officer of Bareilly, where there is now a Government Experi-mental Sugar Factory. Bareilly is near the Himalaya, and has a cold winter, withfrost occurring in December and January, just at the time when the cane is ripening.-Growth is stopped and glucose keeps high. The cane crushed before February is foundto be &quot; high in glucose, low in sucrose, and the density of juice low.&quot; These conditionsimprove in the cane which is crushed after the beginning of February. In Bareillythere are short spells of very cold weather, perhaps twice or even three times afterrainfall in the plains, and falls of snow in the Himalaya in December and January,when the wind is very bitter. Ordinarily the wind is from the west, and the heat ofthe sun is encouraging to growth. In Mesopotamia the conditions are less favourable to the cultivation of sugar cane. It would not start growth after being planted as quickly as in India. There, while it is comparatively young, it gets the benefit of therainy season; in Mesopotamia it would after germination be exposed for 6 months ofits young life to continuous heat, some of it very intense. A month or two later itwould have to endure the weather produced by the winter rains with considerably more frost than in India, and, after each bout of rain, with a piercing north wind whichchecks all growth It seems likely that, if it survived the severe hot weather of itsearlier days, the violent cold would prevent it from ripening. This can, however, onlybe settled by experiment. If such experiment proves to be favourable, the Arab willhave, if he is to make the cultivation of sugai-cane a success, to mend his present wayseven more than will be necessary in the case of cotton.The cultivation of beet for the manufacture of sugar seems to offer a better prospect.Beet does well everywhere from Mosul to Arabistan. At Mosul a considerable amountof it is cultivated. It may be that the kind now cultivated would be useless for theproduction of sugar. But all roots seem to grow well in Mesopotamia, and a suitablekind of beet could doubtless be grown. Why should it not be possible for Mesopotamiato manufacture all the sugar required for herself and for Persia ? In 1911-1912, out of124,000 packages landed by the Germans, 70,000 were sugar from Belgium. Duringthe war Egyptian sugar and Hong Kong sugars (the latter imported by Japan, buthaving their origin in Java or Mauritius) seem to have held the market.Between 1900 and 1905 the average value of seeds exported was about 90,000/.,but it fell off later, and of recent years but for a little sesamum and linseed the cultivation of oil seeds seems to have been negligible. India has her linseed, cottonseed, cocoanut, gingelly, rape seed, sesamum and ground nuts; Egypt her cotton andsesamum, and Japan her soy beans. The soil in Mesopotamia.is very suitable, and an agricultural country with its advantages ought not to neglect a crop of the commercialvalue of oil seeds, which may confidently be expected to bring very large profit to thecultivator. A small experiment by the Department of Agriculture in the cultivation of ground nuts at Fallujah gave most encouraging results, and endeavours are being madeby means of demonstration farms to popularize their cultivation. Large quantities of ground nuts are at present imported into Mesopotamia for use in making sweetmeats.It ought not to be long before they and other oilseeds are exported in substantial quantities.It may be inferred from what has been already said that perhaps the most urgent necessity for the economical development of Mesopotamia is the establishment of a department of Agriculture manned by a staff of officers fully equipped with technical and scientific knowledge. A Directorate of Agriculture was appointed by the Army inJuly, 1918, under Colonel G. Evans, a member of the Department of Agriculture inIndia. This Directorate was transferred to the Civil Administration with effect from 1st March. Colonel Evans was just the man to direct agricultural matters inMesopotamia, being qualified alike by knowledge, administrative capacity andtemperament, as well as being enthusiastic about the potentialities of the country. But-sufficient inducements in respect of a programme of operations were not offered to him
to remain in Mesopotamia, and he has resigned the appointment of Director in order totake charge of the Department of Agriculture in Burma. A general outline of his ideaas to the development of the Department is contained in his memorandum of18th December, 1918 (attached, page 30), which he was kind enough to amplify for mein his letter of 28th idem (also attached, page 29). His views on the subject seem to bevery sound. Without a Department of Agriculture developed on the lines sketched outby him there is no chance of the resources of Mesopotamia being properly developed.The Trade Commissioners (paragraph 63 of their report) urged that &quot;tree plantingon river banks, if only for the production of firewood, should be taken in hand at theearliest possible moment and a forest officer should be deputed to discover suitablespecies by experiment and to select localities for irrigated plantations.&quot;The Director of Agriculture was under the Army Order appointing him giventhe control of afforestation, and the Board of Agriculture instructed him to advise theCivil Commissioners on forest matters. He has started several nurseries, among thema central one at Baghdad on an area of ] 0 acres, and spasmodic efforts have been madeelsewhere to plant willow bush and other seedlings. An agricultural expert is not expected to understand about sylviculture, and it was not till the beginning of 1919that a forest officer was placed at Colonel Evans&apos; disposal. There were a number ofofficers belonging to the Indian Forest Service in the force in Mesopotamia and theplanting of trees might have been started&apos; much earlier under the direction of one ofthem. There is no greater need in Mesopotamia and it is to be hoped that a comprehensive scheme for treeplanting will be developed without further delay.There are many trees which seem to be suitable for Mesopotamia and which growrapidly. They are needed for agricultural implements, firewood, charcoal and shadefor man and beast. A great deal could be done in no time and a start has been madein a few places in tending and improving the willow plantations on the banks of theEuphrates and Tigris. Countless seedlings are lost every year in the flood water,which could be usefully transplanted to other places on the river banks or on the canals. The wood is useful for many purposes. Among others it produces charcoalthough of indifferent quality. A number of trees such -as eucalyptus, casnarina,.shisham (dalbergia sissoo) acacia, (arabica and catechu) and poplar suggest themselves as likely to be suitable. This can, however, only be determined by experts after an examination of the climatic conditions and the soil. There is a variety of acacia liningboth banks of the White Nile between Kosti and Dueim which grows very fast andwill stand being submerged for months. The wood is heavy, sinks in water, is-exceptionally hard and is said to be good for boat building and roofing timber. Itmight be suitable for growth in the many areas in Mesopotamia which are underwater for a considerable period every year.Cattle, as indeed do all domestic animals, thrive in Mesopotamia, The Arabbuffalo is a large-framed animal with long horns, somewhat like the Indian buffalo foundin&quot;Berar and the Southern Mahratta country, but larger. They are bred in largequantities along the rivers and in the marshes. The Arabs will not sell them. Thez\rab bullock is small, but hardy. The cow resembles the Jersey cow, except in the yield of milk. The likeness to the Jersey cattle is typical of the cattle throughoutArabia and Egypt where it has not been inbred with European stock. The local cattleare very susceptible to rinderpest. They have little to live on during much of the year.The essential means of improving the breed is by the introduction of fodder crops,,such as lucerne and berseem (trifolium Alexandrinum), as rotation crops. At present there is no attempt at rotation of crops, The Arab goes in for rotation of soils ; whatis sown this year is left fallow next and produces the same crop in the third as in thefirst year. There is great demand for plough cattle especially in the Mosul vilayetwhere the Turks have left few. Sindhi bullocks have been introduced to some extent-and the Arab farmers are eager to get more.Dairy farms were organized over two years ago to supply the hospitals. Theyhave supplied about 15,000 lbs. of milk daily, and the demands of hospitals for cream,and butter in Basra, Amarah, Kut, Baghdad, Nasariyah, Ramadi and Hillah withthe reduction of the demands for hospitals, milk, cream and butter has become available for sale. The dairies are built on the latest plan with the most up-to-datepasteurizing and chilling plants and cold storage rooms. All the cattle sheds aretemporary structures.It was originally intended to purchase cattle in the country, and some 350 headwere bought. It was found that the average yield of milk was about 3 lbs. per head,so the experiment was made of introducing Indian cattle (chiefly from Sind), andbuffaloes of the Murrah or Delhi kind.   This has proved most successful.   The strength.
of the herd at the beginning of the year was 2,324 Indian cows, 28 Arab cows,43 Indian bulls, 16 Ayrshire bulls, 2,105 young stock and calves, 449 buffaloes,15 Indian buffalo bulls and 593 Indian bullocks.In addition to the supplies for the stock on the dairy farms, 800 tons of fodder aresupplied monthly to the transport and other Army animals, The Indian cows arepartly Sindhi and partly Gujarati. The former are much the better milkers. Theaverage yield of the Indian cow is 8 lbs. a day. &apos; I saw one Sindhi cow in the Baghdadfarm which had given over 5,000 lbs. of milk. The&apos;yield of each cow daily is registeredwith great care. After a fall of rain when it is very damp and cold, the cows suffergreatly in temporary buildings. When I saw the farm at Baghdad it was a day or twoafter rain, and its condition was indescribable. This is unavoidable when the rain fallsthe soil (which contains no stone in it) is for several days reduced to a sticky mire.This occurs at frequent intervals during the winter. During the fall of the rain thewind is in the south the change of the wind to the north results in the clouds being-dispersed, and the weather becomes very cold. This is a very trying time for cattle.I saw the Amarah farm in March when the weather had been settled for a fortnight,and the winter rains seemed to have passed away. The cows could not have been inbetter fettle.Twenty-four Ayrshire bulls have been imported. They should be as successfulhere as in India. Out of 24 imported 8 have died. This compares very favourably with the results of their importation into India, and considering the lack of comfortablestabling and the difficulty of complete isolation under war-time conditions, is veryencouraging. They had, in many cases, had rinderpest and Piroplamosis. They lookextremely well and have been serving cows freely. There are already a few youngcalves by Ayrshire bulls out of Sindhi cows, and they are charming little creatures.Gujarati cows have been crossed with Ayrshire bulls, but no calves have been born as yet.The calf by the Ayrshire bull from the Sindhi cow loses the hump, which the latterpossesses, entirely.The young stock that I saw was almost entirely by Sindhi bulls out of Sindhi cows.At a year old it looked extraordinarily well. It is intended to retain the females toimprove and increase the Government herds. The most select young bulls will be sold to Arabs to improve the stock in the country, and the rest castrated and sold as ploughcattle. There should be a very material improvement in a few years in the size andyield of indigenous cattle if the Arab will only realize that it will pay him to feed hiscattle well. At present so far as one can judge he does little for either his milch cowsor his plough bullocks.The common breed of sheep in the Basra and Baghdad vilayets of Mesopotamiais the fat tailed sheep which is similar to the Dumba sheep of the north-west frontier province of India and the neighbouring countries. The breed is apparently foundthroughout most parts of Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Persia and Arabia. The typevaries with the locality, probably as the result of environment and pasture. This sheephas a large frame and has long somewhat coarse wool. The male is horned. the colour varies between all shades of white, brown and black, the two latter pre\dominating greatly in Baghdad and Basra vilayets. The Arabs say that the blacksheep stand the rigours of the climate better than the white one. The sheep seem to suffer a good deal during the excessive cold of the winter, and they have been describedto me as collecting in the heat of the summer and turning their faces inwards to avoid the sun and glare and thus losing at the same time all chance of benefiting from whatair there may be. The total absence of shade and shelter must be very bad for sheep.Trees are required to give them shade in the hot. weather. Reeds abound in themarshes which could be used to form a rough shelter for them both from the cold and.heat, at very small cost indeed.A good sheep, as sold to the Army, will weigh, dressed, about 50 lbs. This weightis often exceeded and perhaps 80 lbs. is reached. But the best sheep of course remain at the disposal of the tribal sheikhs. A small flock of specially selected white sheep is kept on the Amarah farm. The fleeces of six of the whitest sheep were sent to theCawnpore woollen mills for valuation in June, 1918. The report on them was to theeffect that no wool of an exactly similar type is procurable on the plains of India, butwools similar to it are imported from Nepal, Tibet, Turkistan and Baluchistan. the defects found in the samples were : (1.) Most of the fleeces were very dirty and contained a large amount of burr anddung.(2.) The colour was not good. Fleeces, which appeared to be white, contained ahigh percentage of grey or yellow wool. Only one sample was found to bethroughout even approximately white.(7524) c
(3.) The samples varied considerably in fineness, one or two containing a considerablepercentage of fine wool.The length ol the wool is good, and it seems quite clear that the sheep ofMesopotamia is capable of great improvement by judicious breeding and more carefultreatment, I have spoken to many Australians who are much impressed with the fineprospect of sheep breeding in the country. The climate of New South Wales seemsfrom the range of its temperatures to approximate most closely to that of Mesopotamia.The smaller Merino from the warm parts of that country ought to do well inMesopotamia, and its introduction, coupled with improved treatment of the sheep,ought to lead to greatly improved results from sheep breeding. The introduction ofthe Merino strain into India has been found to have a very beneficial effect in point ofweight and all-round richness. As a country for breeding sheep India can bear nocomparison with Mesopotamia. The country will carry a large head of sheep, and at certain seasons of the year the grazing which they get is ideal. &quot;Very little labour isrequired to manage them. They are nomadic like their masters, and, perhaps, for thisreason, do not seem to suffer much from epidemic disease. At present the flocks havebeen very much depleted owing to the demands of the Army on them. The Arab doesnot shear his sheep properly. Wool is often used as a currency and, when the Bedouinwants a little wool to pay lor anything, he will pluck a handful of it from the back of the nearest sheep. Nor is it the practice to wash the sheep. Such wool as gets to themarket gets to it in the worst possible condition. The skins of the local sheep are highly regarded. Were some sheep shearing stations established along the rivers itMould be very easy to introduce a regular time for the clip, and to ensure that the sheep were properly washed before being sheared. Mav and June would perhaps bethe best time for the clip as the sheep need their wool in the winter and hottest weather(July to September) to protect them at one time from the cold and at the other fromthe heat. The Arabs will fall in with the requirements regarding shearing of theirsheep as soon as they realize that it will pay them. The introduction of careful methodsof shearing and dipping, and of packing the fleeces, should enable Mesopotamian woolto gain a high place in the market.There are two lambing periods, one in the autumn and the other in the spring.Success depends very largely on the food available for the flock. Last year the fodderwas better than it had been for years and lambing was consequently very good. Itcould be greatly improved if the owners of flocks would grow some fodder for them.The time of greatest need is the autumn when the country is almost entirely denudedof natural herbage. Berseem would cost little to grow, while as a rotation crop itwould be of much value. In the dried form known as dries in Egypt it ought to bevery useful for feeding sheep. On the whole the prospects of sheep breeding inMesopotamia seem to me to be most encouraging. The Arab if left to himself will never initiate the changes that are required. But he would follow the lead shown tohim by the European, and, provided that the authorities do not discourage the latter,he ought to find the roll of pioneer in the improvement of sheep breeding, notunremunerative. The amount of wool exported from Basra in 1918 was 4,125 tons ofthe value of 306,000/.The sheep in the Mosul vilayet are of different types from those in Basra andBaghdad. The chief varieties are (1) a large-legged white sheep with a brown face andbrown legs. The males have long and curved horns like the black-faced mountainsheep of Scotland. This sheep has rather coarse wool on the leg, and is not good formutton. (2) A small black-faced sheep with a long nose and a tuft of brown woolbetween the ears. This type is a very fine small sheep, short in the legs with a finethick heavy fleece and producing good mutton.The country round Mosul city has limestone hills and good turf, and there areenormous areas which had in February, when I was there, splendid grazing for sheep.The flocks appeared to be very few. There are very few black and brown sheep in theMosul vilayet, and in this respect the flocks there present a striking contrast to thoseof the two southern vilayets, where black and browns largely predominate. By carefulselection and by importing rams, probably the small merino would be the best, heretoo it ought to be possible to breed a very good type of sheep there.On my way home through Persia I saw a sheep which is the mascot of the band ofthe 2nd Bn. Gurkha Rifles. This was served out as a lamb for rations to the regimentat Baqubah in August, 1917. The band was allowed to keep it as a pet. It is now the most magnificent sheep which i have ever seen, and has splendid fleece. One canimagine from this how the breed in Mesopotamia can be improved if it is only lookedafter and fresh blood is imported.
(7524)Colonel Garrow, the Acting-Director of Irrigation, has recently prepared a schemeof irrigation haying in view &quot;not only the requirements of the immediate future, butalso the complete restoration of the country.&quot; It would be vain for anyone notequipped with the necessary technical knowledge to express an opinion on the merits ofhis scheme. But as it raises a general issue of a most important character it willperhaps be as well to attempt some description of the general principle on which it isbased.Colonel Garrow has had experience of irrigation problems in Egypt, and speakswith authority. According to his view neither the Tigris nor the Euphrates is innatural regime. The bed of the former has, he says, been raised so that flood-spills occurthe whole of its length and it is unable to carry a maximum flood discharge. Water hasbeen withdrawn wholesale along its entire length ; in its lower reaches its carrying capacity, has been much reduced. In the flood season cultivation is menaced this Ihave seen myself especially above Kut and between Kut and Amarah. The river isflanked by marsh areas, many of which are permanent throughout the year, and which,with the river in its present condition, cannot be drained. The Euphrates is in a worsestate than the Tigris as, while the latter preserves its identity to the sea the former-loses itself in flood time in several enormous marsh areas, and it is not navigable in thelow water season throughout its length. The river is now changing its characterrapidly below the Hindiyah barrage. As a preliminary to the development of irrigationColonel Garrow proposes &quot; in its interests as well as those of conservancy, gradually to augment and concentrate the supply in the rivers commencing at their downstream endsby closure of all superfluous s.ide channels and escapes and by the erection of floodbunds.&quot; &quot;The rivers,&quot; he contends, &quot;will accommodate themselves to the increaseddischarge, sink themselves into their beds, and ultimately be capable of carrying their maximum flood discharge to the sea instead of dissipating them over the face of thecountry as at present. The water levels in the rivers being thus lower it will be possibleto drain the marsh areas into them, put the land now covered by water under theplough and arrange for a co-ordinated irrigation system. Not only so, but drainagewater from irrigated tracts can then be led back to the rivers which will act as themain drains of the country instead of, as at present, as principal though ill-begottencanals.&quot;His policy aims at (1.) Getting the rivers to do their work as rivers by carrying the full discharge inthe flood season, and acting as the main drains of the country, and(2.) Arranging for the withdrawal of supplies for irrigation purposes through the medium of principal canals at infrequent intervals with fixed discharges forthe rivers at the points of off-take.Colonel Garrow has developed a scheme based on these principles to embrace (a.) The consolidation and development with increased efficiency of areas at present;provided with best controlled irrigation systems.(6.) The remodelling of channels in areas where, owing to deterioration, and neglect,:irrigation has to be practised in a wasteful manner and at the expense of therivers.(c.) The maintenance, improvement and extension where necessary of existingchannels in categories (a) and (b) and of river flood bunds.(d.) The survey of areas and the collection of data to enable future projects to be presented, including proposals as to flood escapes.This is an attractive programme. It manifestly, however, depends on the suggestions for the control of the rivers being sound. On this point Dr. A. B. Buckley,who went with me to Mesopotamia, and is, like Colonel Garrow, a distinguishedmember of the Irrigation Department in Egypt, joins issue with him. He points out that sir William Willcocks has stated that the confinement of the rivers between certainlimits is not feasible. Mr. Buckley contends that on the inference that the changes inthe rivers are attributable to the acts of man, it is fair to argue that the Tigris if leftto itself would not have undergone a change and would now return to its natural state.This position he urges &quot; requires careful examination, for, while it might becomparatively easy to induce the river to return to its natural state, it will probably bethe reverse if the river is now in. its natural condition and had to be artificially&apos;confined to a limited and definite channel.&quot; Sir William Willcocks, holding that thetwo rivers cannot be confined between banks, proposed to escape the excess water intothe Habbaniyah (near Bamadi) and the Aggar Guf (near Baghdad) Lakes.
Mr. Buckley holds that unless Sir William Willcocks&apos; investigations are radicallyincorrect the amount of water which may pass the Fatha Gorge where the Tigris issuesfrom the Jebel-Hamrin is nearly double the amount which can pass Baghdad when theriver is at its maximum level of 35 metres on the Residency gauge.   Moreover, thedischarge at that gauge is given by Sir William Willcocks as 5,500 M. 3/Sec, while he computed the flood discharge from the sections of the river near be led, where thedelta begins, at about 9,000 M. 3/Sec.   The only canal, Mr. Buckley says, which could have brought a great artificial change above Baghdad is the Nahrawan taken off theriver near Tekrit.   Sir W. Willcocks estimates that the canal has been out of use for from 600 to 700 years.   Mr. Buckley contends that the inference is that the river fromBaghdad upwards at the present time is in its natural condition, and that to confine it within banks would be an operation which might be accompanied by considerable difficulties and must involve heavy expenditure.    It would be unprofitable to followMr. Buckley&apos;s arguments regarding, the Lower Tigris, the Euphrates and the general programme based on the assumption that it is possible to confine the rivers betweendefinite limits.   Enough has been said to show that an issue of the first importance capable of settlement by experts only-has been raised by Colonel Garrow!s programme questions relating to irrigation, navigation and drainage are all involved.   The TradeCommissioners proposed the establishment of an Irrigation Board, consisting of at least two highly qualified irrigation officers, to collect detailed information in regard to therivers and existing canal systems with a view to making recommendations for therestoration of the regime of the rivers a board more representative of the differentinterests involved seems to be required.   For the time being the Irrigation department has been placed in charge of the ( bnservancy of the Tigris.   Sir George Buchananexpressed the opinion that a prolonged study of the conditions of the Tigris isrequired.   Such a study seems necessary,  but in view of the  urgent  need ofutilizing the river to the beso purposes it should not be too prolonged.   There are many interesting subjects which would need to be considered by such a, boardand which could not be properly disposed of by one constituted only of experts inirrigation.   For instance, the effect on the Ijao bar of large quantities of silt scoured outof the beds of the Tigris and Euphrates by preventing the dispersal of their floodwaters would have to be considered.   It would perhaps be not more unreasonable- untilthe matter had been thoroughly investigated, to assume that a large increase in thevolume of water entering the estuary at high tide would inhance the intensity of theebb, and might counteract any tendency to the increase of the Fao bar by the depositof additional silt, than to anticipate a contrary result as being likely to result from thefact that more silt would be moved by the two rivers.   Again some irrigation officersfeel very strongly that the cultivation of rice in those parts of Mesopotamia, especially the Shamiyah district, where it involves the supply of water from the rivers at a timewhen it is scarcest cannot be justified from an economio point of view.   Certainly, as ageneral principle, the utilization for the cultivation of rice, of water, which by anotherarrangement of distribution from the river, could be made available for the cultivation of larger tracts of wheat and barley, would not be regarded favourable by those whohave studied revenue and agricultural questions, in the East.   But, on the other hand,the political authorities feel very strongly about the need for maintaining this ricecultivation.   Rice is much consumed among the Arabs both in Mesopotamia and in the adjoining Syrian desert.   It is, although none that I have seen appeared at all equal tothe best Indian qualities, exported to a considerable extent.    In 1911 the value ofthe export was as high as (17,000/.) and paddy (109,000/.).   It is evident that thisquestion lcould not be left entirely to the decision of a Board of Irrigation Officers who might resent the cultivation of rice, in a country of such scanty rainfall as Mesopotamiabeing  allowed  in  special tracts  to  be  the dominating factor as regards canaldevelopment.The remarks so far made relate directly or indirectly to the production inMesopotamia, and, before leaving this subject a word or two might be said about thesystem of Civil Administration in the country. At present there are 14 divisions eachin charge of a political officer with political assistants under him. The political officersand their assistants have been recruited from the political service in India, the IndianCivil Service, the Sudan Civil Service and the army. Each political officer is in directrelations &quot;with the Civil Commissioner, who has as his Revenue and Financial Secretary,.a member of the Indian Civil Service of some twenty years standing, who was formerlyin the North-west Frontier Province. My short experience in Mesopotamia does not justify me in expressing any opinion on the system of the administration in force whichhas naturally been devoloped in war time, and doubtless bears the impress of its birth
having taken place during war conditions. I may, however, perhaps express mygeneral impression that the existing system of administration will prove too centralizedfor peace time, and that its personnel is generally not adequately equipped withadministrative experience, or knowledge of such very important branches of theadministration in an oriental country as revenue and police. The determination forsuch I believe it is to exclude persons from Great Britain and the Dominions from taking part in the development of the country seems to me to be very regrettable. Iunderstand that it is based on the view that the country should be developed in theinterest of the Arab population. On this very ground the introduction of Englishmen, and Australians will be veiy beneficial. There are large areas of crown lands whichthey could develop without in any way trenching on tribal rights. If Mesopotamiais to -take the place it ought to in such enterprises as cotton cultivation, themanufacture of beet sugar, and sheep breeding, the impetus will, in my judgment, haveto come from the white man. A large and intelligent landowner was, in conversationwith me, very emphatic on this point. He told me that he intended to appoint anEnglishman to control and manage his estates.To turn to the prospects of commerce in Mesopotamia.   The value of the imports to, and exports from, Basra for the years 1908-1912 was : 	1908.	1909.	1910.	1911.	1912,Imports Exports	  2,411,508 1,784,382	  2,360,102 1/504,004	  2,634,596 1,668.714	  2,855,677 2,525,937	  2,653,984 3,246,560Total	4,195 950	3,864,1&apos;)6	4,303,310	5,381,614	5,900,540Excluding the value of goods consigned to Government, or imported on behalf ofGovernment, the imports during the past four years have been :  &apos;&apos;    &apos;          &apos; &apos; &apos;1915        .........       629,0001916        ........ 2,71.1,0001917......       ... 4,067,8001918        ......... 7,401,700The figures of imports for the past two years are remarkable and merit some consideration.   They compare as follows : 		-1917. -	1918.

The road from Baghdad to Kasvin and Enzeli is now open.If funds are given to complete it, it will be an excellent trade route.The condition of this road compares very favourably with other roads, e.g., that from Kasvin to Teheran still under the management of the Russian Company. Nobetter surface could be found aiiywhere than that between Hamadan and Kasvin afterdescending on to the plain from the Ahoa Pass. The run from Hamadan to Kasvin ina Vauxhall car took 6 hours and 20 minutes.The exports from Persia to Baghdad in the last six months of 1918 are valued at742,000/. This figure does not fall far short of the total export trade (837,000/.) fromBaghdad in 1906, and the value of the exports in the half-year exceeds the value for awhole year in 1911 (711,000/.) and 1912 (546,000/.). There is a considerable demandfor British piece goods needed in Russia through both Resht and Meshed. Packtransport is very scarce, and it does not look as if any material increase of it is likelyto become available in the immediate future.    A carrier can, it is said, recover the
whole value of his animals for a single journey between Baghdad and Hamadan.Arabs, who usually do not go beyond Kermanshah. are taking their camels toHamadan. The road throughout its length is thronged with transport. The rates perton at present charged kindly ascertained for me by Colonel Moens, D.S.O.(Commanding the lines of communication in Persia) are remarkable 		Winter	Summer.From Ruz railhead to 		 	 Kermanshali		55	40Hamadan		90	65Teheran	......	149	110The contractors assert that they have lost on the rates charged in the winter, butmake a profit in the summer. Railhead *vi,s to be moved from Ruz to Quareta (about30 miles) on 15th April. The distance from Kasvin to Teheran is 92 miles and toEnzeli (road in parts more difficult and at times even dangerous) 145 miles. The costto Enzeli should be taken at a little more than the cost to Teheran. Piece goodsshipped at Basra and exported to Baghdad have to pay freight from Great Britainand import duty 10 per cent, at Basra. The freight by river charged by Messrs.Lynch &amp; Co. before the war as a regular charge was, according to the TradeCommissioners&apos; Report (page 94), 40s. a ton, and they sometimes charged as high as80s. a ton. We were informed by the Deputy Director of Telegraphs at Baghdad thatthe Department was charged by the firm not long ago Rs. 55 a ton for the conveyance of telegraph materials. The charge from Baghdad to railhead would be small; atKermanshah there is an import duty (perhaps 5 per cent.), but it seems to be oftenevaded. The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Teheran told me thatthis must be the case, as the receipts deposited with the bank did not nearly representwhat the goods transported, according to the official figures which I gave him, shouldhave paid. Some time ago the Persian Government, in order to stop the influx ofroubles into Persia, prohibited export of goods into Russia. The prohibition has been withdrawn, but in its place there is the requirement that the exporter must deposit30 per cent, of the value of the goods he exports to be liable to forfeiture unless hebrings back to Persia goods of equal value within 17 days. The oil imported intoPersia cannot, judging from the traffic on the road, at all approach in value the piecegoods being exported, and yet exporters are, in spite of all the other heavy charges,said to submit readily to the confiscation of their deposits at Enzeli. and are said to be making 100 per cent, on the top of it all. It is difficult to comprehend the whole affairif one remembers that the kran is worth about half a rupee at present, that theexchange value of the rupee is Is. 6 c/. and that you can on an English note easily get100 roubles (Azerbaijan issue). The value of the sugar imported into Basra beforethe war was  295,000 in 1908.359,000 in 1909.449,000 in 1910.539,000 in 191 1.292,000 in 1912.The exports of sugar from Baghdad in the last six months of 1918 amounted in value to-168,000/., and of tea to 119,000/. The latter figure is double that of the whole import of tea into Basra in 1917. The exports from Baghdad in the last six months of 1918amounted in value to 1,293,000/. The available pre-war figures for the whole year were-1909, 765,000/.; 1910, 853,000/. ; 1911, 746,000/.; 1912, 981,000/.The value of the principal exports from Basra in 1918 was  Wool......   306,000Dates ...      ...   266,000 (incomplete, as duty on 5 steamer loads shipped atthe close of the year had not been paid. total value of exports is estimated at 9:53,000/.). &apos;Textiles ... 140,000Skins and hides 26,000Tea    ......    16,000
The tea and textiles were re-exported to Persia (Mohammerah). The export of wool and cereals ought to increase very considerably in 1919, The export of the chiefcereals was prohibited in 1918. The exports of grain before the war (chiefly barley and wheat) were 126,000 tons in 1908, 36,000 in 1909, 64,000 in 1910, 148,000 in 1911and 231,000 in 1912.It is anticipated that there will be, as soOn as peace conditions come in, a consider-able demand in Mesopotamia for pumps and&quot; agricultural machinery, milling and building materials (especially timber) and luxuries such as European furniture, motorcars, launches and bicycles.Trade should boom in Mesopotamia after the war. The import trade has been mainly transit trade. Not only ought it to change its character in some respect, but with Persia, north and south, alike demanding British goods now that Russia can provide none, the volume of trade between Great Britain and Persia ought to increaseenormously. It is unlikely that Mesopotamia will supply the greater part of thedemands north of Hamadan if arrangements can be made to use the Trans-Caspian routewithout destructive transit duties, but the state of the railway between Batoum andBaku is so bad at present that for the time Basra must remain the chief centre of import. So far as Persia up to Hamadan is concerned, the situation might be allowedwere a line constructed from Baghdad via Hit, Anah, Deir-a-Zor, Tadmur, Home toTripoli or Haifa. This would tap the rich graimproducing country on the Euphrates(a line already runs from Baghdad to Hillah, the centre of this tract, and another toDibban on the Euphrates on the road to Hit) and, if the metre-gauge line, which nowtouches the Persian frontier from Baghdad, were prolonged to Kermanshah, it would carry all the goods required from Europe for that part of Persia. The residents ofKermanshah and all the surrounding country appear most anxious for a railway. all along the journey through Persia the people were most friendly. They have cultivatedtheir lands on, considering the way in which the population has been decimated, awonderful scale, relying on us to see that, contrary to past practice, the man who sowsa crop shall reap it. It would be a bitter disappointment to the cultivators were we towithdraw, and the men with a larger stake in the country would regret it just as much.It is hard to believe that the British ever exercised so great an influence in Persia asthey do at present, and almost impossible to conceive that the influence could be enhanced. There is only one man in Persia and that is Sir Percy Cox, He verymodestly attributes our position in there to-day to the behaviour of the British soldier,and doubtless this has had much to do with it. The spectacle of two Russian Armiesand one Turkish Army going down the great road and up again carrying fire andsword wherever they went and burning and pillaging every village or homestead towhich they came, has been succeeded by that of a small British force by whichpayment was made for every article supplied, and the men of which were not onlyexemplary in committing no acts of violence on their way, but showed active kindnessto the inhabitants. Such a spectacle could not be without its effect, but it needed thepersonality and influence of a Percy Cox to raise British prestige in Persia to the point at which it now stands. It would be the greatest act of folly not to take advantage ofit without delay to establish and consolidate commercial relations with Persia. Froma commercial as well as a strategic point of view the prompt extension of therailway to Kermanshah seems the first step to take, and it seems hard to believe thatthe Persian Government would not readily assent to it.
MEMORANDUM BY THE DIRECTOR OF LABOUR.   (/See page 11.)The Possibilities op Local Labour in Mesopoiamia.The following notes may be useful in determining the amount of imported labour that will be required in Mesopotamia after the war and will help to dispel the idea thatwe shall be able to rely more on local labour than during the war : Number of Arabs employed. The largest number of Arabs that have ever beenemployed in Mesopotamia since the Occupation is 45,058 in April, 1918. This figure had gradually increased from May, 1917, after the Occupation of Baghdad, and there isno doubt that we were then employing a large number of the agricultural populationwho had left the land to seek employment and food after several months of starvation.The prospects of a good harvest caused the Sheikhs to ask, through the politicalofficers, for the return of cultivators.By Jury, 1918, we had been obliged to release 13,000 men, reducing our total to32,22(1 between Basra and Samarrah.   See Appendix (A).In November, after the Armistice was signed, we were further asked to releaseArab labour for cultivation, and I disbanded three Arab Labour Corps at Basra, whichwere composed entirely of Felaheen, which brought the total for the same area down to28,526.To-day, including the whole of the Mosul area in which we employ some 10,000Arabs, the Arab labour return stands at 39,405.More releases are contemplated, and we even expect to disband Local Corps, whoare not actual cultivators, in areas where cultivators are required.Labour for irrigation work. To-day the Irrigation Department employs far morelabour than any other department and most of their work is done by imported labour.See Appendix (B) and (C).This alone is sufficient to prove that the local labour is far from adequate to meetthe ordinary post-war needs of the country.I quote two examples of the most important works The Mahmusiyeh Canal. In the case of the Mahmusiyeh Canal, the greaterportion of the work had to be done by Indian labour, owing to there being insufficientpopulation in that district.The average number of Indians employed daily between 1st May and 31stDecember, 1918, was 2,&quot;* 14, whilst the highest figure was 4,267 in July.The only Arab labour available for which we were given figures were 500 during may.There are still 500 men of the 17th Labour Corps finishing off this canal.I did not recruit any Arab labour from that district for any other works during that time.The Khalis Canal. In the case of the Khalis Canal, the Arab labour figures were more satisfactory, although far below what I anticipated would be available. Beforethe project was undertaken, I was asked if I could provide sufficient local labour forthe work. I replied in the affirmative, judging by the previous years figures of Arablabour employed in that area. iUnfortunately for my estimates, the Political Officer of the district required far-larger numbers in 1918 for agriculture, and I was unable to bring pressure to bear onthe inhabitants to produce sufficient men, and again the work had to be done mostly byimported labour.We had great difficulty in keeping what Arab labour we had on the work, evenby giving them rations and fairly high wages. It was obvious that they wanted to goto their cultivation, although the extra cultivation with a more reliable supply of water,which the new canal would open up, was no inducement for the Sheikhs to make theirmen work.Appendix D shows the average number of Arabs and other labour employedduring each month, and there are still 250 Indians remaining on the Khalis until, 15thMarch.Flood protection on the Tigris. There is far from sufficient Arab labour even forthe protection of the country from floods. Of the total 6,573 men employed on bundingthe Tigris only 300 Arabs could be collected for this work. The remainder consists ofTurks and Indians.Between Kut and Ali Gharbi there are a few Arabs working on bunds round theirown camps or villages, but they probably only amount to about 300. I know that part of the country particularly well, having spent six months among the Arabs therein 1916, and the population cannot provide more labour than it does at present.
7524) nRemarks on Arab labour. Most of the Arab labour controlled by this department is round the towns and military stations, and consists of men, women and children ofall ages.Tribal labour is sometimes called upon by political officers to assist in irrigation and railway works, but these cannot be counted as part of the labouring population. Theyare all cultivators and will on no account leave their own tribal area for work whichdoes not concern them.We have sometimes called upon Sheikhs -to supply a certain number of men for a labour corps, but they have always been disbanded when required for agriculture. -All the heavy porterage is done by Persians and Kurds, whose numbers keep fairlysteady, but they are only suitable as porters.Possibility of increase. I do not think we can hope to increase the Arab labour for at least a generation unless the deseri tribes come into the cultivated areas andsettle down under a peaceful administration.Amount of imported labour required. Without knowing what the programme ofdevelopment of this country will be in the future, it is impossible to say how muchimported labour will be required.It is safe to assume that the present numbers of imported labourers cannot bereduced if the country is to be protected from floods ; even in the ordinary way, railwaysand roads are to be maintained and cantonments built.We shall shortly lose 10,000 Turks and 2,000 refugee labourers, and our Arabs aredecreasing as agriculture increases.A reduction of the present labour force by 20,000 after the surplus garrison has gone is all that we can allow.(Signed)  J. W. Frost, Brigadier-General.Director of Labour.

P. Hewett, G.C.S.I. 28th December, 1918.Dear Sir John,I am returning my note on the future organization of the Agricultural Department in this country with afew amplifications as requested by you.With regard to research, its importance is evident. Plant selection offers&apos; immediate prospects ofsuccess, as the crops grown in this country contain so many different varieties that they are nearly uselessfrom a commercial point of view. The best prospects of success are likely to accrue from the careful plant to plant selection of existing field crops in the country. An economic botanist is, therefore, urgently required who would deal, in the first place, with suitable crops such as wheat, barley and rice.Cotton is a special crop which, to all intents and purposes, is not yet grown in the country, but whichholds forth such vast possibilities that a specially qualified officer is warranted. It is possible that a grant in aid to cover the cost of cotton experimental work could be obtained from the British Cotton GrowingAssociation or a similar body.Another line of work which offers great possibilities is the improvement of the indigenous fruits of thiscountry. Certain centres appear to be excellently suited for the production of the citrus fruits and alsostone fruits. Local cultivators, however, have very little idea of pruning, grafting and budding, andinstruction on these points to the cultivators and the introduction of improved varieties would haveimmediate results. A proper system of grading and packing is also wanted. The economic botanist,therefore, would require a section on his own to deal with: 1. The improvement of staple crops by selection and hybridization.2. Introduction of cotton.3. Improvement of the fruit industry.4. A mychological sub-section to deal with fungoid diseases.An entomologist is also urgently required, as insect pests are extremely abundant.   I need only quotethe date diseases, the stem borer, and the various varieties of locusts as a few of the instances which have-already been brought to my attention in the last few months.
Also, an agricultural chemist for the department will be required, whose duties, apart from the ordinaryanalysis of soils, crops, manures, &amp;c, will be fully occupied in dealing with the problems of salt anddrainage. Another important section which will be necessary is that of agricultural machinery. Already,in this country, the local cultivator shows far more desire to invest in water lifts and labour-saving devicesthan he has ever done in India. Much pioneer work is required in this direction, especially with regard totractors and to harvesting, threshing and winnowing machinery. The officer in charge of this sectionwould be made responsible for training local mechanics in the erection aud management of pumps and other agricultural machinery.I need say little about the necessity for demonstration farms. The need is obvious. The real; cultivatorseldom travels far from his home and must have&apos;some place fairly close by where he can go and see the newvariety actually growing or a new method being put into practice. It has been abundantly proved in Indiaand Egypt that the issue of leaflets or the giving of lectures are, by themselves, of little value unless theycan be backed up by a practical demonstration in the field. The danger of sending out new seeds before they are thoroughly tested has already been abundantly brought home in this country.I may quote the case of Indian wheat which was imported last year and which failed, partly owing tothe fact that it was of the wrong variety, and the case of potatoes, the cultivation of which was notunderstood by the Arabs, and which were also much too late a variety for this country Indian maizealso was issued for seed in large quantities last spring and failed to set cobs as it came into flower duringthe middle of the hot weather. Further experiment has proved that if sown in August, it g-ives a satisfactoryoutturn in October.These mistakes were, of course, due to war conditions and were perhaps unavoidable to a certain extent,but we must take care to avoid such mistakes in the future and the only way to do so is by insisting onpreliminary experimental and demonstration work in the field.In conclusion, the staff at Headquarters (where we should have an agricultural school, combined withlaboratories for research and an experimental farm) would consist of a Principal who would be anagriculturist and would also be manager of the experimental farm; of an economic botanist; a cotton expert;an entomologist, and an Officer in Charge of Agricultural Machinery (Agricultural Engineer). It willprobably be necessary also to have a special officer to deal with sheep and cattle. Apart from headquarters staff, District Officers in charge of circles, who must be trained all-round agriculturists, are required at present.Yours sincerely,(Signed), Colonel,Director of Agriculture,Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.Agricultural Directorate,New Street, Baghdad,18th December, 1918ToMemorandum.Subject: The Reorganization of the Agricultural Department.1. The abrupt cessation of hostilities has naturally led me to consider the reconstruction of theAgricultural Department. The immediate and urgent necessity for supplying food and fodder for the army of Occupation has, up to the present, occupied our chief attention. It is now time to consider the futurelines of development of the Department. The rough scheme I am attempting to describe below is theresult of much serious thought and of consultation with the more senior members of my Department, someof whom have had considerable experience in Agriculture Departments in other parts of the Empire, viz,,.India, Ceylon, Egypt and the Colonies2. I am assuming that Government is not itself likely to undertake cultivation on a large scale. Directcultivation by Government is rarely profitable and, in addition, it is presumably undesirable that the state should enter into competition with private individuals. Our work therefore should aim at raising thestandard of cultivation among ihe iocai agriculturists.3. In the first place, it is essential that we must have something really better to offer the cultivatorthan he has at present. This entails the necessity for experiment and research. I cannot too stronglyinsist on this point. I have seen the confidence ot cultivators in a Department upset by well-meaning, butmisguided, attempts to introduce new methods before they have been thoroughly sifted and tested on a practicalscale. Once the confidence of the cultivator is lost, it is verv difficult to re-establish as he is, in most countries, very conservative and difficult to move unless he is absolutely convinced that the new method islikely to pay him better than the old.Research is, therefore, needed in the first place to invent remedies for dealing with insect and fungoidpests, of which this country appears to be the favoured habitat, to breed better varieties of crops and domestic animals, to deal with problems concerning salt, drainage, &amp;c, and to try new types of agricultural machinery.After research comes experiment, in which the work of the research experts should be tested in thefield under natural conditions.Finally comes demonstration work, in which the new methods, machines or crops recommended can be practically demonstrated (against the corresponding local method) to the cultivator of the country. no real cultivator will adopt a new method or seed unless he has actually seen for himself, in his own particulartract, that method successfully tried or the new seed growing and giving better yields than his own.Trained men will be required by the Department to carry out this programme. At present we are working with soldier subordinates, British and Indian. These are nearly all likely to leave, and we mustface the eventuality that we have got to rely in the main on the local population for our trained personnel.The sooner a central farm and school of agriculture is started to train this staff the better.I have attempted very briefly to sketch a policy which, if it leads to nothing else, will at least start a discussion in the right direction.   1 wish now to state what, in my opinion, is immediately required.Baghdad, the capital of &apos;Iraq. should be the locality fixed for the School of Agriculture and the Researchlaboratories. This institute should lnive an experimental farm attached, on which the economic botanistand the cotton expert could conduct their plant breeding experiments and in which their selections could be

Now varieties will have to b? propagated on aconsiderable scale and a seed farm should be attached. Probably 1,500 acres would suffice, but if sheepbreeding is contemplated, a larger area of desert land would also have to be acquired. At Baghdad everystaple crop in Mesopotamia can be grown with the single exception of rice, and therefore the educationalvalue of the farm for students at the school would be great. In addition, this site should, if possible, be close to the Military Dairy Farm, where dairying and the stock breeding could be observed by the student.The land between Waziriyah and the Tigris would provide a suitable stretch. Plow irrigation for the shitwi(summer) crops could be obtained from the Waziriyah, which is the tail end of the Khalis, and a pumpingstation could be established on the river to demonstrate lift irrigation.Demonstration farms of about 300 acres each will be necessary at tho headquarters of each AgriculturalCircle Officer, whose headquarters now coincide with those of the Divisional Political Officers. I havealready managed to start farms at the following centres : Nazariyah.Amarah.Hillah.Baqubah.Kadhimain.Suwairah.Samarrah.Klianiqin.The sites of all these, with the exception of Khaniqin, which is too remote, are excellent. Khazimainwhen the Baghdad Farm is started, will not be required.I have not attempted much this season, and work on the farms is practically confined to testing &apos;Uraqand Indian wheats and in the production of clean wheat and barley seeds. The foundation has been laid in each case, however, for suitable permanent farms. Hillah, Baqubah and Khaniqin are irrigated byHow.   Amarah is partly flow and partly lift.On the others, pumping installations have been established. The Shamiyeh district could probably best be served by a rice farm, as that is the staple crop in the tract.I have not touched on the subject of the superior staff of the Department. Until the terms of service which are to be offered after the war are known, it is impossible to make any forecast.Meanwhile, if my proposal regarding the establishment of a Central Research Institute, School and experimental Farm be approved, I suggest that a small committee be appointed to select a suitable site.
