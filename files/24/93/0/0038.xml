0ASIK3T.COMKITTBE ON IRELA3Q.SECOND- REPORT 0? THIS COHKITTHJE.(ffor girst Ho-port aec Paper No. CP. 56)Tho Committee havo given careful consideration to thequestion referred to them by the Cabinet as to whether it mightnot bo advisable to introduce their proposals for Irish Home rule in tho first instance in the form of rosolutions instead of thatof a Bill.,   The Committee decided unanimously that the introduc-tion of a Bill would be preferable to the introduction of rosolu-tions.   Tho principal reasons which led them to this conclusionwere as follows ;-(a) That procedure by resolutions must inevitably involve.delay, Whereas the general consensus of opinion that ifthe Government intended to deal with Ireland at&quot; all itshould act as rapidly as possible.(b) That procedure by resolutions might be interpreted inAmerica and the Dominions, as well as in,Ireland, as aprouf that Groat Britain did not seriously moan to do anything.   It would be said that if they did moanbusiness, they would obviously have introduced a Bill.(c) That as soon as debate on tho resolutions began, theGovernment would be immediately compelled to disclose the whole of their plan in all its details, for thoHouse would probably refuse to accept the rosolutionswithout knowing what they really implied in practicalworking out.(d) Finally, thero might be serious difficulties, especially with a comparatively inexperienced House owing to thefact that many Members would probably only agreo toaccept the.earlier resolutions on the understanding thatlater resolutions which were vital to the Bill wore alroaccepted.   When the resolutions got to Committee an end-loss number of amendments could be taken, almost as many as in the Bill itself.   If tho resolutions were onlyintroduced for tho purposes of Second Reading, this second Reading Debate,could take plaoo as easily on a.   Draft Bill. i2 Whitehall Grrdcna, G-W.17th November-, 1919,
