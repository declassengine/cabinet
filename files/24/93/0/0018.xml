[Tills Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]THE question has arisen of the continuance by Great Britain of a guaranteeef the independence and integrity of Belgium, and an immediate decision on thematter is required.It will be well if I briefly recapitulate the position with regard to this question. -Negotiations have been proceeding at Paris between the Belgian and NetherlandsGovernments for the conclusion of a Treaty of Revision of the Treaties of 1839 bywhich Great Britain, France, Prussia, Russia and Austria declared the perpetualneutrality of Belgium, and guaranteed that neutrality against attack from any party. These negotiations Have been attended with a considerable amount of friction, and at one time it appeared likely to be abortive. I need not go into the causes of the misundei standings which arose between the Netherlands and belgian governments, as these difficulties would now appear to have been surmounted, anda draft treaty prepared by the Chairman of the Committee of the Peace Conferencedealing with&apos; this question is, according to our information from Paris, likely tobe accepted by both sides, provided that the Belgian Government receive adequateassurances with regard to the question of a guarantee of their immunity from attack by Germany.The Belgian Government have stated that they are ready to accept the assurances given by the Netherlands Delegates on the Revision Committee to theeffect; (1) that the Netherlands will -adhere to the League of Nations; (2) that in anycase the Netherlands Government will treat the violation of Dutch territory,including Limburg, as a casus belli, and (3) that in the case of attack the territory of Dutch Limburg wdll be defended. On these conditions the Belgian Governmentare prepared to consent to the abrogation of the Treaties of 1839, and they agreethat the question of the guarantees to replace those stipulated in the Treaties of1839 should be left for settlement subsequently by the League of Nations. At thesame time M. Hymans, the Belgian Minister for Foreign.,Affairs, has pointed out to Sir F. Villiers that this&apos; reference to the League of Nations presents a serious difficulty for the Belgian Government. He emphasised that Germany wouldprobably adhere to the League of Nations, and have a place in the Council, and thatthe German Government would not agree to any arrangement directly opposed totheir interests, and might even decline to join the League if some decision contraryti.- their interests, but required by the Belgian Government for their security hadalready been taken. M. Hymans also pointed out that some delay must occur beforethe League of Nations could decide upon the guarantees to be given to Belgium, andthat if the Treaties of 1839 were abrogated, and no means of security for Belgiumsubstituted, the position of that country would be more perilous than ever.M. Hymans accordingly requested Sir F. Villiers to ask His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto give the most favourable consideration to the following proposal, namely, that until some other satisfactory arrangement should be concluded, the British andFrench Governments should, consent to retain as operative the provisions in the treaties of 1839 by which those Powers guaranteed the independence of belgium and the integrity of the Kingdom.M. Hymans has therefore in effect asked that Great Britain and France should come forward as guarantors of the independence and integrity of Belgium from thedate of the Ratification of the proposed Treaty between Belgium and Holland until such time as the League of Nations shall have provided fresh guarantees for thesecurity of Belgium. *Further, early in September last, the Belgian Ambassador, on instructions fromhis Government suggested to me that the French and British Governments shouldconclude with the Belgian Government a Treaty guaranteeing Belgium againstunprovoked attack by Germany.   The proposal was that this Treaty should be3Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1919.[148226]MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.[1433]
similar to that concluded between Great Britain; the United States of America andFrance for the protection of France in &quot;the same circumstances. The BelgiainGovernment have made a similar suggestion to the French Government, but no specific request has yet been received from them for such a Treaty; and it is clear from reports received from Sir F. Villieis and from Paris that the FrenchGovernment have not committed themselves in any way to the Belgian Governmenton&apos;this point. M. Hymans, however, when asking for the interim guarantee, towhich I have referred above, stated that he did not desire this latter suggestion tosupersede the proposal submitted to me by Baron Moncheur that the British andFrench Governments should enter into an&apos;engagement for the defence of Belgiumin case of unprovoked aggression on the same lines as the British and AmericanTreaty with France.My latest information from Pa*ris is that the Netherlands Delegates have accepted, or are on the point of accepting the draft Treaty for the Revision of the1839 Treaties which the Belgian Government are also ready to accept, but it isclear that the Belgian Government will not accept this Treaty unless they aresatisfied on the question of guarantees. In.fact the Belgian Delegates now wish to insert in the Treaty an article as follows: &quot;Great Britain and France undertake to maintain in operation untilthe conclusion of the arrangements foreshadowed in Article 1 (i.e. the newguarantees to be provided by the League of Nations) the guarantee given bythem to Belgium in virtue of the Treaty of 19th July, 1839, in so far1 as thatguarantee concerns the independence of Belgium and the integrity andinviolability of her territory.&quot;Sir E. Crowe has pointed out to me that, in his opinion, the insertion of aguarantee of this kind in the proposed Treaty would be a mistake. The objectof the Treaty being to abolish the guarantees set up in 1839, it would surely be wrong to include in the new Treaty an article expressly continuing the guarantees of 1839 on behalf of two Governments only among the seven Governments signrngthe Treaty. He expresses the opinion that if a guarantee is to be given at all thematter should form the subject of a separate Treaty between Great Britain, Franceand Belgium, and that possibly &quot;the United States of America should be invitedto join.On this point the following considerations arise: 1. If we and the French refuse to give this guarantee to Belgium in some formthe negotiations between the Dutch and the Belgians are likely to breakdown. They have only been kept alive with great difficulty, and if a rupture occurs many important problems will remain unsolved.2. It is unlikely that the United States will join in the guarantee. Not onlywere they &quot;not a party to the guarantees of 1839, but their general policyis to avoid alliances of this nature affecting only European countries.. 3. Although a guarantee of any kind to Belgium is. not likely to be popularhere, and would probably &quot;be criticised in Parliament, it might be possibleto defend an interim guarantee of the nature for which M. Hymanspresses, while I do not think that the country should be asked to enterwith France into an indefinite guarantee of Belgium against Germanagression such as M. Hymans has hihted at. Not only would this be unpopular, but we should not in my judgment be justified in undertakingso heavy a responsibility.I understand that the French Government would be prepared, if necessary, tojoin with us in giving an interim guarantee to the Belgians, and in all thecircumstances the best course of action seems to be as follows: . The British Delegates at Paris should be instructed to resist the insertion of*&quot;&quot;.&apos;&quot;&apos;     the interim guarantee in the Treaty in the manner now proposed by the4   .      Belgian Delegates at Paris.   We should explain to the French and the belgians that for the reasons given by Sir E. Crowe the guarantee shouldbe put in the form of a separate instrument, and that His Majesty&apos;s*   Government are ready to conclude, at the same time as the conclusion of&apos;.&quot; the&apos; Treaty of Revision, a separate Treaty whereby France and Great
Britain undertake the guarantee of the integrity and inviolability of;&apos;y Belgium until such time as the League of Nations shall have providedfresh guarantees, and in no case for a period longer than five years, after which period, if the League of Nations have not taken action, the question must be reconsidered.This would not, in my opinion, be a dangerous, while it would be an easilydefensible, responsibility.C. of K.November 10, 1919.
