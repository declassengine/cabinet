W..                       SIR HUGH LAWE5 S PICTURES *^y^/yXG^^ ----------.....MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET BY TrlE FIRST LORD OF TEE ADLIRALTY*I venture to ask that the decision in regardto the Lane pictures may be re-considered.I greatly fear that if it is definitelydecided to have these pictures in England, irritation andannoyance quite out of proportion to the real merits of thecase,, will be aroused in Ireland, and especially in Dublin jand I am sure my colleagues will agree that at this momentevery effort ought to be made to avoid anything of thekind.     The view which will be taken in Ireland is brieflythis -: -London and the great provincial towns of Englandhave splendid collections of pictures: we have few, if any,tho Lanewhich would have been a valuable possession for Ireland; butEngland steps in, deprives us of this small gift, basing herclaims upon certain legal interpretations of wills andcodicils.     We believe that they were intended for Ireland;and to deprive   us of them is to afford another instance ofEngland&apos;s disregard of Irish interests.I feel sure that the Irish Government wouldconfirm this view.(Intld) \:TI     t&apos;X1 &quot;Jj f19.11.19.
