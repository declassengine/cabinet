One successful Labour Candidates in the MunioipalEleotlons have not yet had time to formulate a polioy.    in yorkshire l&amp;ey are said to be of rather moderate views, withambitions that do not go beyond a natural desire to raise thesooial positions of their wives.    In Islington the labour Mayorhas rather theatrically rejected the &quot;baubles&quot; of office, and the mayor of Stepney has had himself photographed by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;in nothing but his chain of offioe.Too much stress cannot be laid upon the irritation caused by-high prioes.    Even if a slight reduotion could fce made all round,the result would be immeasurable,    \*ten working men read of the enormous profits made by large firms on necessary articles theysooff at the Profiteering Tribunals, vtoioh order refunds of a fewhalfpence.Ukere is still irritation at the leisurely progress of house-building, but it is something for them to have seen that a starthas been made.The feeling among ex-Servioe men shows no sign of improvement,flfoey are aware of the poor response made to the King*s appeal incertain districts, and very many ex-soldiers are still unemployed.Some information is given about the proposed General Staff for labour.Some very violent speeches were made in Manchester at a recent meeting of the International Socialists.Leeds is reported to be in a state of aotive ferment.
NATIONALISATION OF THE MINES.The only fresh point in the propaganda campaign fornationalisation was contained in a speeoh made by Mr.Hodges at Chandoa Hall on November 6th      He said thatit would be impossible to carry forward the nationalisation Bill put forward by the Federationwithout the co-operation of the managerial staff of the: mines, and that his Federation was in touch with the managers who, he hoped, would eventually Join them.    he admitted, however, that at the moment there was a greatdeal of aitagcnlsm between the managers and the miners.He went on to say that the miner was an apathetic person who would shrink from individual responsibility,Great oapital is being made out of the allegedfailure ef the Government tt justify the 6/- per tonincrease.On November 8th a oonferenoe of the Glasgow and district Co-operative Booiety delegates, representingsome 100,000 co-operators, approved the nationalisationscheme.&quot;The Miners&apos; Federation proposes to raise the salaries Of miner M.P&apos;a to  600 per annum.PROFITEERINGThere is great dissatisfaction inmany districtsabout the proceedings of the Tribunals,    In Liverpoolit iff alleged that tradesmen,,ore shielded, and that when. &apos;    offences have been proved the delinquents are merelyordered to refund the exoees.    There is a strong feeling.. in favour of penaltiesThe .Cumberland Farmers&apos; Union has passed aresolution demanding that the prioe of butter be raised to 4/- a pound, and &quot;this goes side by Bide with thegeneral demand that the price of milk shall be reduoedto 9d a quart. &quot; &apos;&apos; - Profiteering/
Profiteering continues to be one of the greatestoauses of unrest,THE HOT8INQ OJEdTIOH.     &apos;*&apos;   &quot;&quot;&apos;..t Next in inportanoe &quot;to profiteering ,oomea the housi. question.     In Binoingham, where the demand for houaea-is at least as great as in any other part of the count.vthe slowness of the building operations is oauslng grsadissatisfaction. &quot; :OQrbpE&amp;yglVS,, X^IETIES AjTjJ THB......p&amp;LJjTOOiSTS-&apos;Hie movement to invest Trade Union funds in Co-operative Banks is gaining favour among the EngineeringUnions. -  Tlie Worcester Branoh of the amalgamated society of Engineers has already deoided to withdrawits money from the &quot;Capitalist Bank&quot; and put it into thCo-operative Sooieties,     Other branches are meditatingthe same&quot;action.Oh -the other hand,, there are signs that many co-operators of the commercial classes are resenting the suggested use of their Sooieties for strike purposes.In Barnaley they are. perturbed at the statement made in&quot;the House regarding this movement.At Barrow it is proposed to put . 500 of Co-operati1money aside for distribution amongst members who are indistress -through the moulders1 strike, and any strikerwill be inoluded in the grant provided he oonsents to; . become a co-operator - an Ingenious method of increasing- .m-the.membership.THE. mmHZL STAFF FO&amp;LABOUHIt appears suddenly to have ooourred to Mr. G.D.H.Cole, a member of the Committee which is to report on^vGeneral Staff for Labour, that it might be well, beforemoving any further, to ascertain what policy the staff is to pursue.     In the current issue&quot; of &quot;The Guildsman&quot;&quot; &apos; &apos; - of
mm    jjof vihioh he is the&apos; Editor, he&apos; asks whether the GeneralStaff is to direot the strategic operations of thestruggle against Capitalism, or whether it is to be an&quot;instrument of industrial harmony&quot;.     The putting of thisquestion so late in the day is oharaoteristio of theohaotic state of mind under which even the Trade union leaders appear to labour&apos;.    The persons who firstproposed the General Staff certainly did not intend itto be an vinstrument of industrial harmony&quot;.    Mr. Colepoints out, quite truly,&apos; that if the great instrument ofthe Triple Alliance broke down just-When it was wantedit seems scarcely worth while&apos; to dreate a new body whiohwill oe overtaken by the same fate.    He says, &quot;We may at any time plunge into a revolutionary situation......... We may be able to make our General-;.Staff at fiveminutes&apos; notice, but what we qannot make in five minutesis our plan of campaign before and after the involution&quot;.In other words, the whole attitude and polloy of trades union must be overhauled.   ,He does not suggest the&quot;one big Union&quot;, but the preparation of a comprehensive statement of objeots and a programme of action basedupon those objeots.    He points tb the FrenchConfederation Gen^rale du Travail, where the formationof a General Staff was only a subsidiary proposal.The projeot of the &quot;French-Society to whioh he refersis-far more ambitious than anything that&apos;has been proposed- in this oountry.    There is to be an EoonomioCouncil of Labour to study the scheme of reorganisation of&quot; production and distribute the&apos;sum of wealth for thebenefit of all.    Representatives of all the great unions and Syndicates are on the Council, and all that is     ,needed is the one thing whioh it will never get in thisworld - harmony among the members themselves.THE/
:  Hii.In view of the strong opposition to the meresuggestion of oompulsory arbitration, the attitude of lancashire Working men is curious.    My Liverpoolcorrespondent writes that Trades Unionists in his area are in favour of oompulsory arbitration, espeoially inI6aae of disputes that affect the. whole ooniiaunity, likethe railway strike.    Shey say that in nine oases out often, if aoourate reports were issued to the publio, the-    great body of publio opinion would be in favour of theworkers.    Their attitude regarding oompulsoryarbitration does not, of course. oarry with it approvalof interference with the right to strike, which they regard as their moat powerful weapon.THE UTOMiOYMOT? DQKATKH.The agitation against discontinuing the unemployment donation has not subsided.    Ity Liverpool correspondenteven goes so far as to say that there will be serious trouble if the doles are withdrawn during the winter.miQZPtbmmm- .... - &apos; IThere has not yet been time for. the Labourmajorities to adopt a definite policy.    In the Leedsarea the Labour Councillors appear to be men of moderateviews, chiefly concerned with -their personal ambitions anjintroducing their women folk into the petite bourgeoisie.At Sheffield, there is an agitation against the LordMayor1 a luncheon, and the Labour Counoillors propose toreifuse to attend whilst &quot;thousands of men, women andchildren are starving&quot;.    There is also a movement on foot to oreate a salary for the Lord Mayor, in order th&quot;Labour men may not be disqualified for the office bylack of means.. TEE/
She position among the railwaymen is not reassuring.The Government proposals to give the men a voioe in themanagement are not considered satisfactory and itis doubtful whether they would be content with anythingshort of having directorships open to them.It seems probable that Mr. Hhomas may be &quot;side-tracked&quot; to the political department with  1,000 a year,while the industrial power will pass into the hands ofMr. Cramp.Undergraduates at Oxford appear to be following the Labour movement very keenly, and it is curious tofind even here that some of the advooates of revolutionare of alien origin.    Kiere was a debate in the unionlast week on direct aotion.    Uke division was against 319; for 117.    Judging from the speeches, the minority belonged to the glib and raw type of youngIntellectual that is always to be found at a University.SHE SHOP 8TiiWA&amp;D3 OP GLASGOW.Ity Glasgow correspondent reports fresh activityamong the yhop Stewards, who appear to be following apin-priok polioy by aggravating the most trivialgrievances , the objeot being to oourt the favour of the extremists.UNJSEST AT IflBDS.My Leeds correspondent reports an increasingfeiment in his area) whioh seems to have resulted fromthe hard work put in by the extremists during theMuni oipal Elections.    He menti ons th e inoreas ingunpopularity of intervention in Russia; the growingdisbelief in the Press, especially in its representation
of the Bolsheviks; the influenoc of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;;the high prices and profiteering; the moulders&apos; strike and position amongst the engineers.   It is, of oourse, no^unnatural that a prolonged strike such as that of theironmoulders, whioh affects so many other industries,should he a very disturbing faotor.THE WLMQ AMfoTGST EX-SS&amp;gVICE MEN. &apos;She discontent among exnaoldiera is not diminishing.Ihere is a possibility of disturbances in the Londondistriot when the unemployment donation is stopped.   Thereis also a strong feeling against the discharge of ex-service men from Government offices, where women andoivilians are retained.   Ex-soldiers estimate that50,000 disabled men are unemployed, largely owing tothe attitude of the Trades Unions, and the feeling of;      the men is gi-owing bitter.Branches of the National Federation are breakingaway and joining the National Union and the Comradesof the Great War.I referred in my last report to the InternationalUnion of Ex-Service Men.   This has lately lost thetenanoy of its Hall in Argyle Street, Glasgow, and itis threatening reprisals of some kin4,- James Cox,the General Secretary, has gone to-&apos;Dublin to form a. Branch there.   The campaign of Mr. Hannah in Jlfeshireoame to an abrupt and .inglorious end.   At Buokhaventhe meeting was so hostile that he failed to obtain a hearing and returned home in disgust.W Liverpool correspondent tells me that thereare still 10,000 unemployed ex-soldiers in Liverpool,who/
. who are greatly inoensed at the poor response made tothe King&apos;s appeal.   According to a report of the manchester, Salford, Eooles and District Local Employ-ment Committee, the response has oertainly been poor.Up to October 30th 5,000 firms were approached, and only 443 replies were received; of these the majorityaccepted the scheme, but four firms returned the paperswithout oomment and 38 stated. the.t they were eitherunable or unwilling to adopt the soheme.   4,557 firmsdid not even,take the trouble to reply.   In Leeds it isthe same story; only 40 replies were reoeived to some,000 oiroulars.   in this, area there is ohaos among theex-soldiers organisations; the leaders are waging awar of recrimination and members are not paying theirsubscriptions.   At Birmingham on November 9th aresolution was passed that if the King&apos;s appeal did not meet with the neoessary response the Government shouldformulate a soheme under which employers shall be forcedto absorb all unemployed ex-service men,, It is reported that the secretary of the FrenchEx-Soldiers&apos; Committee has proposed to the National Union, an international congress of ex-soldiers of all belligerentcountries in Switzerland in a few months time,violent SPEECHESA remarkable set of revolutionary speeches was.delivered, on Sunday, November 2nd, at the Manchester TradesHall under the auspices of the Manchester and&apos;DistriotUnited Sooialist Counoil.   The speakers were George Ebury(who ivas arrested in Glasgow for his connection with the &apos;general strike), Isaao Brassington, National Union ofitfllwaymen/
Bailwaymen, Councillor Shinwell of Glasgow, 0&apos;Shannon,a Sinn Feiner, Walton Newbold, and a discharged soldierwhose name was not given.   The audience numbered about i1,000.   The &quot;:*ed Flag&quot; was sung and three oheers weregiven for the Bolshevik involution.   The tenor of allthe speeches was the same; a revolution was imminent andall that was needed was to combine the militant andreokless spirit of the Irish Sinn Feiners with the discipline and educated spirit of the British Sooialist.If this oould be done, nothing oould stand in the way.Walton Newbold made a speech thct ought to haveshocked his fellow Quakers.   He said that they must beready to hold by military force the political and.industrial gains they have won; they must &quot;shoot straightand fight to the last gasp&quot;; neither the ballot box norindustrial action were sufficient, they must be ready tomake their revolution in five minutes and establishtheir Soviets in five seconds.The ex-soldier said that ex-service men knew thatthey would have to use their arms in defence of theproletariat.   If the Government had been ready for war there would have been less bloodshed, and if the fightingsection of the Sooialist Movement is ready for war therewill be less bloodshed when the industrial revolutionoomes.  He said that ex-soldiers must be-ready for actionwithin the next six months - it might be even nearer -and if they oould show a twentieth part of the couragethey showed in the trenohes the revolution would be successful; even if they died in the fight they would notdie in vain.There was sufficient material in each of these speechesfor/
for prosecution, if the evidenoe were forthcoming.On the second anniversary of the Bolshevist coupd1etat several meetings were held, although the 24 hours&apos;strike, which had been projected by the Glasgow trades and Lfbour Counoil, did not take place.At a meeting at Liverpool on November 7th, to anaudienoe of about 250, very violent speeches were madeby Mr. and Mrs. Walton Newbold and W. Paul.   Mrs. Hewboldsaid that the Government hvd begun to see the justnessof Bolshevik rule, in fact they were becoming Bolsheviksthemselves.   Paul stated that an Industrial Counoil hadbeen formed in Glasgow which had perfected plane for taking over and oarrying on Scottish industry.   He saidthat their meeting had taken plaoe on the 25th October.Plans had been made for distributing food and for removingohildren and sick persons from the disturbed areas, inorder that when the decks were cleared industrial actionoould be carried on with ruthleseness.   He urged Liverpoolto follow the example set by the &quot;Mosoow of Great Britain&quot;.Speaking of the railway strike, he said that in anotherweek Capitalism would have been brought to its kneesbut for the traitorous action of Thomas end other supposedLabour leaders.   How near to success they had been he oouldnot tell, but it was enough to know that Mr. Lloyd Georgewas in a state of desperation.Walton Newbold made an attaok upon the Labour Membersof Parliament and said that since speeches and resolutionsare useless he has now decided to talk &quot;revolution notresolution&quot;.   He urged the workers to do the least    ,possible amount of work, for with the machines runningand/
and no production they were hanging finanoial millstonesround the neck of the Government.   Every penny wastedby the workers for their employers was a step nearer tothe financial crisis, and every hour lost to production was a gain for the revolution.At a meeting in 400, Old Ford ;toad on the 9th,David rjamsay of the Eleotrioal Traces Union said thatthousands of pounds had been wasted in pamphlets andthat propaganda must now be directed towards making theArmy, Navy and Polioe class-oonscious, for a revolutionwould be useless unless the Army and Navy were on their side.   In the afternoon the Workers&apos; Jooialist Federationheld a meeting in Hyde Park, where the audienoe were told that if they wanted to hear the truth about rtossia theymust listen to Commander Kenworthy and Colonel Maloneand not to Colonel Ward.At c demonstration at Kingsway Hall on November 10th -at which resolutions congratulating the .-ted Armies were passed to the singing of the &quot;Internationale&quot; end the &quot;itedFlag&quot; - Tom Mann, the new secretary of the amalgamated society of Engineers, came out in his true colours as arevolutionary.INDUSTRIAL W0;ffE.iS OF THE WOxfoD. .iAs an illustration of the class of persons whobelong to this Society, it may be mentioned that two men named Edwards and Bishop, who have started a book shopin iifid Lion Street, open it only for two or three hourseaoh day and spend the rest of their time in stealingvaluable books from better class shops.   This, at anyrate, is what they say they do, and they call their Hindustry &quot;sabotage&quot;. *Oi-iGMISED/
OfflANISED HOOLIGANISM IN GLASGOWlily correspondent reports that during the recentMunIcipal Elections, Messrs. John McLean, 3. Shinwell,James Maxton and other notorious leaders organisedbands of roughs to break up the meetings of non-socialists and assault the speakers.   The practioe is worth noticingas it may be, adopted by the revolutionary organisers.In Govan (Shinwell&apos;8 ward) knuokle-du3ters were used ina melee at a sohool, and the cliairman was severelyhandledIf one of these roughs is arrested the fine is paid from a fund to, which each member subscribes,   They areseldom imprisoned,.and they gibe at what they regard asfarciof-l legal proceeding^.ILi. HAMSAY UiiOuQlUdMJIn a recent letter Mr. Macdonald writes, &quot;I have hadto speak with brandy in my pocket and doctors in attendance&apos;.&apos;He la rather unhappy at the general failure of theSocialists.   His comment on the Soviet Government 1s:-&quot;tfhe Moscow Government drifts back,   It modifies its position week by week, and those who hasten from the3econd to the ihird international are likely soon tofind that, their gods have left their temples.&quot;LIEUT.

This outbreak consisted oftwo attacks on the ftoyal Irish Constabulary Barracks atBallivor and Dillon&apos;s Bridge.   As far as can be ascertainedthese raids were made by men brought to the soene of actionfrom a distance, as motor oars were used.   The two attacks were apparently planned.by the same Irish Volunteer Brigadeas they took plaoe simultaneously on the same evening.deports from the south state that the feeling inCounties Gelway and Tipperary is extremely bod.   Hie whole population appears to be in sympathy with Sinn Fein.   Agood deal of agrarian unrest is again manifesting itself.3ome of the small farmers who have, hitherto shown them-selves loyal are now showing a good deal of irritationat the restrictions on fairs and market3.
