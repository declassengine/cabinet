&apos;   GIFT OF AIRCRAFT TO POLAND,11 &quot;t 1*1 ---.---&apos;r circulate to my colleagues a Memorandum which has&apos;heenprepared at the Foreign Office on the subject of the proposed- gift of aircraft to Poland,November 21st 1919. c. of K.On October 7th the Air Ministry informed the ForeignOffice that the Bri:ish Delegation in Paris had expressed awish that a certain number of British aircraft ahculd be madet available for the Poles, and asked accordingly for enquiriestc be made whether (l) such a gift would be acceptable to thePolish Government,  (2)*-any particular type of. machine wasspecially required.   It 7/as suggested that the offer should bemade to Monsieur Paderewski while he was in London, but as thatopportunity did not present itself, Prince Sapieha was requested   Ito place the offer before the Polish Government,   He expressed his thanks on October 16th, and on November 1st informed theForeign Office, in detail, of the complete number of aeroplaneswhich were required tc complete the air programme of thePolish General Staff, in order that His Majesty&apos;s government might themselves designate which, and how many it would be possibletc supply.   The aeroplanes required were:-(a) .    Four to fifteen Scouting Machines (Bristol Fighterbeing the most suitable);(b) Seven to&apos; fifteen Racing Machines (S.E.S. Liartinsidecr Sopwith DeiphXtt&quot;;) \.( c) Four6** fifteen &quot;Bombing i.achines (L..H.9.,)r ,On October 5lst the Air Ministry wrote to the foreign : :-- Office/
Office saying that &quot;since the date of the Air Council&apos;s letter,the Cabinet have arrived at decisions in regard tr the supplyof war material to Poland which are inconsistent with theCouncil&apos;s proposal for a free gift of aeroplanes to the Governmentof that country&quot;, and that therefore they must withdraw theprevious offer.The Cabinet decisions are presumably those to he found inthe following Cabinet Minutes:-(l)   No. 631 of October 16th that Sir E, Crowe should beinformed;(a) that His Majesty &apos;s Government were in generalsympathy with the proposal to give support to the Polish Army;..(b) that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the responsibilityfor helping the Polish Army to be one which rested with theAllies. generally and only in a minor degree with Great Britain;(c) and that the British Military Representative at versailles should be informed that Kis Majesty!s government intend to limit the stores to be given free to non-marketablemunitions .(2).   No 633 of October 22nd.Any assistance which it might be possible for the WarOffice to give to Poland should form a contribution tc an allied effort and not be an independent contribution.In this connection it is, however, to be noted that theoffer of the aeroplanes in question was communioated toPrince Sapieha on October 15th, namely, before the cabinet decision had been formed, arid that it would be highly undesir-able now to withdraw the offer in view of decisions of subsequent.date/.
date      The principle agreed to by the Cabinet would notoe violated by carrying out the offer already made. and inview of the enthusiastic manner in which the proposed gifthas been acknolwedged both by the Polish minister and bythe chief of the Polish General Staff, it is. I submit, inthe highest degree undesirable that we should now retract i:.11 .8-4)
