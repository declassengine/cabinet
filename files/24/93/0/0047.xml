/itannlo MajestVs Government)FINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE MINISTRY OF FOODMemorandum submitted by the Food Controller- In accordancewith War Cabinet 635.Minute 6*.(.1) The trading operations of the Ministry of Food have been reportedto Parliament on two occasions, viz ... a certified account for thefinancial year ending March 31, 1918 (in Command Paper 191 ) and a provisional account for the financial year ending March 31, 1919 (in command Paper 286).   The attached Schedule reproduces in columns 1and 2 the figures already given in respect of these two years..Column 3 gives an approximate estimate for financial year ending march 31, 1920.   Columns 4 and 5 give the estimated aggregate profitand loss in the case of each commodity for the three years 1917-20.(2) The Ministry of Food has always regarded itself as a co-operative society whose constituents are the nation.   It has consistentlyendeavoured to be self-supporting without making a profit.   Itsefforts to procure cheap food have been  handicapped by various considerations.   It is a duty of the F,ood Controller to encouragehome-production and the successive guarantees to farmers althoughbased in each case on the estimated cost of production have resultedIn an alarming Increase in the price of home agricultural products.During the war considerations of.tonnage threw.the Department to an unprecedented extent upon the United States as a source of supplies.The United States had not previously been a food exporting countryexcept in the case of grain, a/id in order to secure the requisiteexportable surplus guaranteed prices were instituted which made theAmerican market the dearest in the world.   The conclusion of hostilities-ties has not relieved the situation to any marked extent, as the fallin exchange more than counterbalanced any natural fall in prices.(3) The margin of profit secured up to 31st. March, 1919, has furtherbeen depleted by measures adopted through political considerations.In the early part of this year an insistent demand arose that theMinistry should sell its accumulated stocks, if necessary at a loss,in the belief that the revival of trade would cause a fall in prices.It was thereupon determined, with the consent of the Treasury4, to sellall stocks that were, not required for the maintenance of distributionat the cost not of their acquisition but of their replacements   In thecase of oils and fats this method Involved a. loss of some  2,009,000,but aa the previous profits amounted to  6,000,000, this did not muchsignify.   In the case of meat, however, the reduction in price hasinvolved a loss of approximately  5,500,000 up to 30th September, 1919and as there were no pre-existing profits, recourse was necessary toprofits accrued in respect of other commodities.&apos; Treasury sanctionwas given for a definite grant In respect of meat, but it was notanticipated that any funds would have to be provide^ by the exchequer for this purpose if the Ministry of Food were looked upon as a singletrading entity, and thus able- to set off its profits on one commodityagainst losses on another.   The considerable arrivals of Australianmutton and New Zealand lamb have, however, made it necessary to sellimported mutton and lamb at practically cost price, instead ofderiving from such sales a profit of approximately  1,500,000, whiohtogether with some  1,800,000 from the sale of hides it had been intended to utilise to recoup the loss in respect of home-killed meat,and in effect to show on the whole trading in meat no further loss.Again, the fact that the Board of Trade has made no contracts for thepurchase of South American beef may render it necessary to allow theprivate importation of this meat at a price which will enable: It tobe handed to the wholesale trader at loj-d. per lb.   This will cause a further loss of profit amounting to approximately  2,500,000, which
would otherwise have been made, and will make it impossible to pay for home-killed meat at future guaranteed prices without loss to theExchequer.   The alternative is to increase the price of home-killedmeat to its actual average cost, but it is doubtful if this meat canbe marketed at such a price, and in fact it may be necessary to reducethe price of home-skilled meat&quot;to below its present price in order tosell it.   What the new reduced price will be and what the I03S to be incurred by the Treasury is likely to be it is impossible to estimate.(4) Apart from political exigencies, prices have in all cases been fixed at such a figure as to ensure no loss to the GovernmentsConsequently profits have generally ensued,, as it is impossible inpractice to fix a price which exactly covers costs.. In some casesfinance had to be provided on a hand-to-mouth, basis which prevented the placing of contracts for any reasonable period ahead.. It must also be borne in mind that reserves had to be built up In order tomeet possible losses on liquidation of stocks..*It will be understood that,, in view of the magnitude of the transactions involved,, the exact figures given in columns 3, 4 and 5of the Schedule should be accepted, with some reserve ; but it isconsidered that they nevertheless present a fairly accurate indication of the ultimate result of the Ministry*s transactions as a whole.   Aswill be seen, they show, over the three&apos;years in question, a profit of  1,132,071 after crediting the Insurance Reserve.   The actualoperations for which the Ministry is responsible over this periodamount to over  1,-000,.000,000,, so that the profit amounts to about1/I0th of 1%,.(5) As a natural result of the commercial methods followed by theMinistry of Pood,, profits and losses have to a very considerable extent been pooled.,  Thus,, tho profits made in connection withImported Cheese have been used to subsidise Home Cheese.   Further,pooling has been carried out within the same series of commodities;e.g. the reserves obtained In connection with Condensed Milk havealso been used to support the Home Cheese Industry.   Moreover, in oneor two cases this principle has been carried further.   There arecertain other profits of an adventitious character such as the profiton tea,, part of which was&apos; accumulated as a reserve against liquidation of stocks,-, but was not required owing to the removal of control being followed by a rising market on which these stocks were sold by auctionat a profit.     :(6) One most important function of the Ministry is to prevent violentfluctuations of price to the consumer*   Since the time when the reserves of profits in the Ministryrs hands were accumulated prices have risen considerably and it has only been owing to the existenceof these reserves that the Ministry has been able to stabilize retail prices as a whole up to the present time,.   It should be noted in thisconnection- that from month to month the Ministry of Labour revisetheir statistics of the cost of living and every serious increase which takes place is immediately followed by a   demand for increased wages; but a decrease in the cost of. living does not have the reverse effect.-    The purpose of the ministry&apos;s reserves is in theview of the Department to preserve equilibrium so far as possible, toprevent fluctuations in prices operating too freely in the price of foodstuffs in this country and in this way to prepare for the timewhen control can be entirely removed with a reasonable certainty thata stable level of prices in the future is assured,(7) The following explanations are given on individual items inthe schedule.Milk Products   A small profit remains after providing for lossesarising from the scheme of milk control,, by which compensation is payable to wholesale milk dealers in respect of diversions of supplies
and other measures taken in order to secure equitable distribution.Both the scheme and. principles of compensation have been approved byHcMo Treasuryc   Certain losses on condensed milk requisitioned bythe Ministry and distributed after the date on which the control ofprices terminated have also been provided for.,   There will, further,be claims in connection with dried milk supplied to Infant WelfareCentres in cases where the factory operation can be proved to havebeen conducted at a loss.Butter and cheese.   The loss is due to compensation payable to cheesemakers for losses incurred in manufacture owing to the high cost ofproduction (see paragraph 5 above)*Meato   The deficit is due to loss on realisation of stocks of imported meat&quot; during the summer of 1919 together with the increase in theprices guaranteed to farmers on home-grown meat (see paragraph above).Oleaginous Products *   The loss in the present year arises from the reduced demancTYor warlike purposes e0g, for castor oil as a lubricantfor aeroplane engines and whale-oil as an ingredient from whichglycerine for high explosives is obtained, and from the sale of stocks at the cest of replacement on a falling market.Teaa   The profits are due to the fact that stocks were liquidated ata considerably higher figure than was expected and the reserve fundaccumulated to meet the probable loss was not required for thispurpose 7Dried Fruitsg   The profits shown have been made principally oncurrants and raisins; supplies being still short and selling priceshaving remained at their former levelo   There Is, on the other hand.,a slight loss on Persian dates, sultanas and figs.Bacon.   The profits represent a margin of only 2% on the turnroveraricTTnclude profits made on bacon unsuitable for home consumption and sold to neutral countries..   In view of the position of theexchange and also difficulties of storage and transport due to therecent labour troubles, no profits are anticipated during thecurrent year.   The profits on previous transactions will probably be entirely absorbed by a reduction in the retail price.Vegetable Supplies   The loss represents what was for all practical purposes a direct subsidy to potato growers.Fruit.   The ministry&apos;s arrangements for the pulping of fruit and subsequent supply to jam manufacturers were not continued during thepresent season.   The realisation of the plant and fixtures has been steadily proceeding, but as there is little or no private demand forthe special machinery employed in pulping, the final year&apos;s accountwill show comparatively heavy losses.Vegetable Preservation..  The loss has been incurred in the manufactureoi potato flour ahd farina and&apos; in the desiccation of green vegetables,all of these processes being largely of an experimental nature.Part of the loss is also due to: the failure of the V/ar Office to takeover, as promised, a considerable proportion of the output, &apos;Fish, Game and poultry.   The loss in the first year was due to thesale of herrings at prices considerably below cost by arrangement with the Restrictions of Enemy Supplies Department,   The profit inthe succeeding year was made principally from the importation of eggs.
(8)     It will be noted that the figures for &quot;Expenses&quot; in theschedule are given in respect of each year in bulk.    These figures are made up as follows :-1917-18     1918-19      1919 -20 TotalAdministration   915,768 &apos;2,747,625   2,490,164        6,153,557&apos;   -Services byother GovernmentDepartments-        317,010   1,905,000   1,714,500        3,936,510Interest on capital 125,000   1,245,789   1,121,211        2,492,000Commission onAmericanpurchases. 57,886      200,000      180;000 437,886Total 1,415,664     6,098,414   5,505,875      13,019,955The services rendered by other Departments are the followingOffice of Works (premises and furniture)Stationery Office (printing, stationery, etc,)Treasury (rates on premises)General Post Office (postage, telegraphs &amp; tele-phones )Ministry of Shipping (shipping agency)Railway Executive Committee (free rail conveyance)The item for &quot;interest on capital&quot; has been charged againstprofits in accordance with commercial practice, and is in &quot;respect ofthe use of cash advances from the Exchequer.In addition to the above items a sum of  2,300,000 in respectof Shipping Services and Free Railway Conveyance has been included inthe cicf. price of commodities,.It will be observed that the nett profit of  1,132,071 Isarrived at after treating a balance of Insurance Reserve Fund 6,002,013 aB earned profit.   It should be pointed out, however, that,this balance arises from the favourable war experience of theMinistry, and was earmarked as profit in view of the proposed cessation of trading by the Ministry of Food as at 30th OMne last; but now thatfresh trading commitments have been undertaken it is doubtful if this figure can be regarded as realised profits.(9)     Appendices 1 and 2 give some account of the current transactionsof the two Royal Commissions dealing respectively with Wheat and Sugar,
(.10)     I desire to add a reference to future policy *   The Board ofTrade have expressed the wish that my Department should take overfull responsibility for all meat supplies;   but I have given instructions for the reply to be sent that unless and until this ministry is given some assured degree of permanence, I cannot agreeto assume this or any other fresh charge of a permanent character.I shall, of course, make arrangements for supplies of imported meat for the civilian population until the 4th July, or such earlier date as existing obligations will admit.Generally speaking, 1 propose to free all homo agricultural products during the first six months of next year0    As I have statedin Parliament, so long as there is a world shortage of sugar and of butter some method of organised distribution of these commoditiesmust be maintained.   I shall endeavour to devise a less costlyorganisation than that of the 1,800 Local Food Committees and the 13Divisional Food Commissioners at present existing;   but I amconscious that the success of this Department has been mainly due toits effective decentralisation, and so long as any organisation forthe supply and distribution of food continues8 it will be as well tohave an eye on possible emergencies.Notwithstanding the difficulties of exchange, I think thatcentralised buying in America is cheaper than private buying, andthat this will continue to be the case until the artificial level ofprices in the United States has been broken.    I propose, therefore,to continue the Government purchase of bacon until at any rate the30th June, and the Government purchase of Canadian cheese so long asthe Government purchase of imported butter is thought to be necessary the two commodities are so closely allied in organisation as well asin origin that it is undesirable to separate them.In accordance with the scheme submitted by my predecessor lastChristmas, I propose to transfer to the Ministry of Health responai-inviolability for milk and National Kitchens *(11)    So far as residual functions are concerned, I think it shouldbe determined whether these are to be carried on by a reconstructedMinistry of Food or whether they should be transferred to someexisting permanent Department^   In either case, I can readilysubmit a scheme for the necessary reconstruction or devolution;   butit is essential, to my mind, that some decision on the point of formshould be taken at an early date.GE0* hV ROBERTS.18th November. 1919.

APPENDIX     IWHEAT     AND   FLOURThe amount of the Bread Subsidy, which is estimated at 50.000,000 for the current financial year, represents thedifference between the cost to the State of all wheat ground(together with the cost of milling) and cf imported flour,andthe sum realised by the sale of all flour.Imported wheat is sold to millers at prices calculated to enable the average miller and baker, working under presentconditions, to produce a quartern loaf for sale at 9id.Imported flour is sold to bakers at a uniform price fixed on aparity with the uniform price&apos; of home-milled flour.   In orderto cbviate the necessity for an amendment in the Corn Pro-ducticn Act millers are paid such a bonus on all home-grown wheat ground by them as .enables them to pay prices which are, on the- average, slightly higher than the minimumaverage guaranteed by the Government for the 1919 crop,The attached statement gives particulars of the wheatprogramme for the cereal year, September 1st, 1919, to August31st,.1920.   It will be seen that in addition to an importa-ticn of 500,000 tons of flour, a total of 6,500,000 tons ofwheat is required in order to meet the average annual consump-tion.   Of this figure 1,500,000 tons will be produced at homejof the remainder 2,250,000 tons Is being obtained from America.,1,500,000 tens from Australia, and 1,250,000 tons from theArgentine.The second section of the schedule gives particulars ofthe cost in each case:   the figure ranges from 69/6 per quarterfor Australian wheat to 107/- per quarter for wheat from UfS.A.An analysis of the cost, showing the freight charges in eachcase, is given in the third section of the schedule.The possibility of lower prices before next autumndepends entirely upen the course of prices in north america.   The United States Government have guaranteeda price for the 1919 crop to the farmers, and this price is the basis of the present selling price of the United StatesGrain Corporation,    It remains to be seen whether or not the grain Corporation will be able to market the whole exportable surplus at this price.   As regards the prices fer next autumn,no reliable opinion can be formed until some information asto the prospects for the 1920 crop in North America becomes available.18th November, 1919.

Appendix 2.SUGARThe general principles upon which the Sugar Commissionconducts its trading were described as follows in the FirstInterim) Report of the Commission made in December 1916Cd,8728)J-&quot;Since the Proclamation of 26th October 1914 the .-Commission has held a virtual monopoly in sugar,and It would have been possible to enlarge the profit on dealings in it to almost any extentcBut the view of the Commission has from the first been that this would be to exceed Its legitimatefunctions,,   It would have converted the Commissioninto a taxing authority, and rendered it open tothe charge of arrogating to itself a power whichbelongs exclusively to the House of Commons,,Accordingly the Commission has fixed its sellingprices with a view to earning returns   which should dono more than cover all expanses of the Commission,and provide an adequate margin against contingencies&quot;.Working on these principles the Commission had established on 31st March 1919 a Reserve Fund (composed partly of profits and partly of savings on its Insurance Fund) of about  5..500,000Latterly the fall in the American Exchange* and the rapid risein the world price of sugar following on the relaxation ofcontrol in this country and in Francec have resulted in increas-ing so much the price of the commission purchases, that the oldselling prices do not cover the cost of placing the sugar pur-chased on the marketfc   The.Reserve Fund; therefore; has nowbeen reduced to about  3.250.000, the whole of which would., onthe basis of the selling price of sugar in force up to Ncvemher1st, have been absorbed by the 31st Marcha 19200   With thoincrease of Ida per &apos;ib0 in the price of sugar, however, whichwas introduced on Monday, November 3rd, the Commission&quot;will beleft with a reserve of about  5,000,000 on 31st March 1920,,Between now and 31st March, however, it will be necessaryfor the Commission to make further contracts in order to providefor consumption after that date; it must continue buying frommonth to month in order to have at any moment an assured supplycoming forward equal at least to three months&apos; consumption^   it iexpected that the price at which these future purchases willhave to be made will certainly be such that in April a further increase of 2d, per lb will be required in the selling price of sugar, in order to cover the cost of marketing it.,   Without this increase the capital Reserve of  5,000,.00$ on 31st March wouldprobably be exhausted by the 15th June018th November 19190
