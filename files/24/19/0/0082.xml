                          :  WAR CABINET -                     ^g2                   GENERAL SITUATION IN EAST AFRICA.       As I hare been unable for some time pastvto make any  .. definite statement regarding the progress of operations in: this theatre, the War Cabinet may like to hare a general idea as to how matters stana.       The enemy forces, amounting to a total of about 7,4CI0/ &quot; rifles, of whom 850 are Europeans, with  17 guns, are now restricted with two exceptions to an area in the South, measuring about 250 miles from North to South and the same distance from East to West.     &quot;.The main enemy concentration is in the East of this area in the hinterland of ICilwa and Lindi, upon which places the main British columns are based.   A general converging movement by the British columns totalling about 20,000 effective rifles with 40 guns has  be gun t and some progress is being made.       Two small enemy detachments numbering about 400 rifles, each hare escaped the cor6on*    That in  the North,  near the South-East corner of Lake Tictoria Nyanza,&apos;is  being pursued by the Belgian forces and I hope  may shortly be accounted  for. That in Portuguese territory, east of Lake Nyanza Is  be ing dealt with by General Northey,       In addition to the  Belgian forcesfeentioned above, two Belgian columns of 500 rifles  each will  shortly begin operations in the  Western and North-western sectors  of the  main theatre. Although it is believed that considerable Portuguese forces are available,, these are  affording no assistance.    further, the attitude of the  local Portuguese authorities in refining to allow recruitment of carriers in  their territory  is lively to hamper the success of  the operations unless,  as recently promised, the Portuguese  Government  insist upon these carriers being provided.      ; WAR OFFICE- - v -&apos;-                   (Sgd.)W.RARQBpTSONC R E TQ.l/llO/316G.T.1381
