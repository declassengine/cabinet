B 1 C K S ,,TA.WAR CABIBBT.4-/Mesopot amis/14MesopotBmia Commission ReportMemorandum by&apos;: the Secretary of State for ?^.The Array Council considered the extract from the decisionsof the War Cabinet 175(2), the Judge Advocate-General beingpresent throughout the proceedings;      They were of opinion that all the Officers in questionshould be given an opportunity of giving evidence on oath andcalling witnesses in theiS&apos; defence in answer to those partsof the Report by which their conduct is impugned, and havingbeen advised by the Judgs. Advocate-General -that no chargeshould be preferred against any of them, until a Court of Inquiryhas been held, the Council decided to give orders forthwithfor steps to be taken to hofcd such inquiry which will be inpublic unless at any particular stage the Court in the public no&quot;fr    inierest iotherwige  deterjainee.   A  civil  legal assessor whoRvious                             &quot;&quot;&quot;       should, if possible,  be  a Judge  of  the High Court,  should beappointed to assist the Coi*rt, and either the Law Officers ofthe Crown or Counsel nominated by the Attorney-General shouldpresent the case to the.Court.      As a preliminary to a Court Martial a *summery of evidence&quot;must by law be-taken, which would entail the * presence of all /witnesses, both for the prosecution and the defence.   By meansof a Court of Enquiry the cases can be more expeditiously dealtwith, and it will give the officers concerned the opportunityof defending themselves against charges of incompetence.      in any case in which the evidence would justify charges,and such a course were thought proper, the officer concernedcould be tried by Court Martial.   For this purpose it wouldhowever be necessary to take legislative action to extend- theunderprovision
provision of Section l6l of the Army Act, under which trialmust be commended within 3 years from the date of the offence.The Army Council is hpwever advised that such a course is opento grave objection.      In any case in which it may be found that the evidencetaken at the Court of Inquiry will not legally support any .charge, the Council will consider whether&quot; any other action isrequired.      In the event- of a Court Martial the preparation of thecase will be entrusted to the Treasury Solicitor,  who will alsobe requested to assist the Military Authorities in connectionwith the Court of Sidquiry.      The expense of Counsel who may be employed during anyof these proceedings by the officers whose conduct has beenimpugned, should be charged against the public.      The Council propose to appoint to be the  President ofthe Court of Enquiry General Sir Leslie Bundle,  Q.C.B.?th July,  1917.
