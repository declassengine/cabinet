THE traditional war policy of the Admiralty grew up duringthe prolonged wars and  antagonisms with France.  It consisted inestablishing immediately upon the outbreak of war a close blockadeof the enemy&apos;s ports and naval bases by means of flotillas of strongsmall craft supported by cruisers with superior battle fleets in reserve.The experience of 200 years had led all naval strategists  to agree onthis fundamental principle, &quot;Our first line of defence is the enemy&apos;sports.&quot;     When the torpedo was invented, the  French, tried  to frustratethis well-known British policy by building large numbers of torpedo-boats, and the Admiralty retorted  at once by building torpedo-boatdestroyers.  These destroyers fulfilled two conditions,  (a) they werelarge enough to keep the seas in most weathers and to operate acrossthe Channel for sufficient periods, (6) their guns were heavy enoughto destroy or dominate the French torpedo-boats.  Thus, in spite ofthe  advent of the torpedo, we preserved  our power to  maintainstronger flotillas in close proximity to the enemy&apos;s naval bases.Meanwhile, all along the South coast of England a series of fortifiedtorpedo-proof harbours  in the neighbourhood of  our great navalestablishments afforded  safe, close, and convenient stations for  ourbattle fleets and other supporting vessels when not actually at sea.     Early in the  present  century  our enemy for the first timebecame not France, but Germany, and our naval strategic frontshifted from the  South to  the  East  coast  and from the  Channel tothe North Sea.  But although the enemy, the front, and  the theatrehad changed, the sound  principle of British naval strategy still heldgood.  Our first line of defence was. considered to be the enemy&apos;sports.  The Admiralty  policy was still a close  blockade  of thoseports by means of  stronger flotillas  properly supported by cruisersand ultimately by the battle fleets.     2. It was not to be expected that our arrangements on this newfront could rapidly reach the same degree of perfection  as the. con-.flicts of so many  generations had achieved in the Channel; and sofar as our naval bases were concerned, we were  still in the processof transition when the great war began.   More serious, however,was the effect of the change on the utility of our destroyers.  Insteadof operating at distances of from 20 or 60 miles across the Channelwith their supporting ships close at hand in safe  harbours, theywere now called upon to operate in the Heligoland Bight, across 240     [773]                                        &apos;     B
 miles of sea, and with no suitable bases  foiv their supporting battle fleet nearer  than&apos; the Thames or therForth.;- Nevertheless,  the Admiralty  continued to  adhere  to  their  traditional   strategic principle, and their war plans up till 1911 contemplated the close blockade of the enemy&apos;s ports  immediately upon the declaration of war.   Our destroyers were constructed, with ever  increasing sea- keeping qualities and with a great; superiority of gun power. :\The Germans, on the other hand, adhered  to the  French: conception of the torpedo boat as a  means of  attack upon our large ships.  While we relied  in our destroyer construction  principally on gun power and sea-keeping qualities,  they relied  upon the  torpedo  and high speed  in  fair  weather  opportunities.   But  the  much  greater distances  over which  our destroyers had now to operate across the North  Sea immensely reduced  their effectiveness.   Whereas across the  Channel they could work in two reliefs, they required three across the North Sea.   Therefore only one-third instead of one-half of our fighting  flotillas could  be available at any given  moment. Against this  third the enemy could at any moment bring his whole force.   In order to carry out our old strategic policy from our Home bases we  should have required flotillas  at least three and probably four times as strong as those of Germany.  This superiority we-; had not got and were not likely to get..      3.  Therefore &apos; from  shortly  before 1905 when  the  French agreement was  signed, down  to  the Agadir crisis in 19.11,  the Admiralty made plans to capture one or other of the German islands. On this it was intended to establish an  oversea base at which from the beginning of the war our blockade flotillas could he replenished and could rest, and which  as war progressed would have developed into a  great advanced citadel of our sea  power.   In this way, there- fore, the Admiralty would  still have  carried out their  traditional war policy of heating the enemy&apos;s flotillas and light craft into  his ports and maintaining a constant close blockade;      4t. These considerations were not lost upon the Germans.  They greatly increased the  fortifications of Heligoland, and they proceeded to fortify one after another such of the Frisian  Islands as were in any way suitable for  our purposes.   At  the. same time a new and, vital factor  appeared upon the  scene-the submarine.   The sub- marine not  only rendered ; the  capture and  maintenance  of   an oversea base or bases  far more difficult  and,  as some authorities hold, impossible, hut it threatened with destruction our cruisers and battleships without  whose constant  support our  flotillas would easily have been destroyed by the enemy&apos;s cruisers.      5. This was the situation in October  1911  when immediately after,  the  Agadir crisis the  Board of  Admiralty  was; completely changed.   Seeing that we had  not for the time being the numerical force  of  destroyers able  to master the enemys destroyers in his home; waters, nor  the  power  to support  our flotillas; with heavy  ships, and having regard also to the difficulty  and hazard in all  the  circumstances of storming and capturing one of his fortified islands,  the new Board  revised altogether the War Plans and substituted,  with, the fall concurrence  of our principal commanders  afloat, the
 policy of distant blockade set up in the Admiralty War Orders and so rigidly adhered to ever since.      6. The policy of distant blockade was not adopted from choice, but from necesshy.  It implied no  repudiation on the part of the Admiralty of their fundamental  principle  of  aggressive  naval strategy, but  only a temporary abandonment of  it in the face of unsolved practical  difficulties ; and it was intended,  both before and  after the declaration of war, that every effort should  be  made to overcome  those  difficulties.   It  was  rightly  foreseen that by closing  the exits  from the  North  Sea  into  the Atlantic Ocean, German  commerce would  be almost  completely  cut off from  the world.  It was expected  that the economic and financial pressure resulting from such a blockade would  fatally injure the German power to carry on a war.  It was hoped that this pressure would -compel  the German fleet to come  out and fight, not in his own defended waters, but at a great numerical disadvantage in the open sea.   It was believed that we could continue meanwhile to  enjoy the full  command of the  seas without  danger to our sea communi- cations or to the movement of - our armies, and that the British Isles could be kept safe from invasion.   There was then no  reason to suppose that these conditions would not continue indefinitely with undiminished advantage to ourselves and  increasing pressure upon the enemy.  So  far as all surface  vessels are  concerned, most of these expectations have been confirmed by experience.      7. But a number of profoundly  important changes  have taken place in  the  naval  situation  since  these  plans were made.  The -submarine attack upon commerce ruptures the basis upon which, the policy of &quot; distant blockade&quot; and still more the policy of &quot; distant blockade and nothing  else&quot;  stand.   The  sinkings by submarines have  already  affected,  and will  continually affect,  our power to oarry on  the war.   They are perhaps at  this  moment the main cause of the prolongation of  the struggle.   It  is absurd, for this and  many other  reasons, to speak  of carrying on  this war  as if time  might  not be a decisive  factor against us.   It has also been proved, that the  economic pressure  of our distant blockade upon Germany is not  in itself  sufficient to prevent the enemy from carrying on the. war by land or to force him to come out and fight at:sea.  He rightly prefers to remain in his defended waters, enjoying the command of  the Baltic,  neutralising  and containing Allied forces at least four times the strength  of his own fleet, whileTavaging all our sea communications  with his submarines.   On the other hand, we have been continually impressed with the  obvious fact that we should only incur  useless and possibly fatal losses bysending our present fast battle fleets naked into his defended waters, and we should thereby jeopardise  all the solid advantages we nowpossess.  We have,  therefore, allowed ourselves to be driven by thisnew attack to purely defensive naval measures either of an active orpassive character, such as  eating less  bread, ploughing up the land, .cutting down the forests, dispersing thousands of  guns on merchantships, building more merchant ships for  the  submarines to sink,consuming hundreds of destroyers and thousands of small craft in
  escort  and submarine hunting.   These remedies may be good in /themselves so far as  they  go :  but the policy which dictates them  is the negation  of war.       ::\v;.v:y;-./;    k:&apos;f -y^y-f^&apos; yyyy      8.  In order to return to the old and definitely recognised policy-.  of  close and aggressive blockade, it is necessary to have ships which. -are&quot;comparatively immune from the torpedo, and which can therefor &apos; operate freely in the enemy&apos;s waters  to  support our flotillas and - light craft.   Protection against the torpedo, and to a large extent  against the moored or. floating mine, can be obtained by  building /bulges of a special construction round the sides of ships.  This was-  done in  the monitors  and  in certain older  ships, notably  the-  &quot;Edgars,&quot; at the beginning of the war, with the direct intention of  aggressive action.  These developments have  not  been proceeded  with, but the experience gained since enables better bulge protection to be now devised than was  then possible.   And recently even with. our first design of protection, the &quot;Grafton&quot; (one of the  Edgars) successfully withstood a direct hit amidships by a torpedo  and pro- ceeded on her course with practically undiminished speed,   i      9. The objection to applying these methods of protection to  the- more modern and more powerful ships of  the Eleet has been  the great reduction  of speed which the increased breadth entails.  Our superiority at the outset of the war was not sufficient to warrant any serious subtraction of first-class units from the  Grand Fleet such, as would be consequent upon their loss of speed if fitted with bulges..; But as the war has progressed, the completion  of many new vessels of the greatest power, the concentration of all British. Dreadnoughts. in home waters, and,  above  all, the  accession  of the very powerful Navy of  the United States-the third strongest Naval Power in the world-have vastly Increased our margin of  superiority.    * 10. Comparison of the  Allied and  enemy fleets shows that  we now possess a preponderance  in battleships anal heavy cruisers of. between  4 and  5  to  1.  Moreover,  our ships  in  every class are superior in size,  gun power,  and modernity.  It is therefore possible to form at least two fleets,  either  of which  could fight the  German High. Sea Fleet  on favourable terms.   One of these fleets should be  a fast blue water fleet,  like our  present Grand Fleet, for maintaining the supremacy of  the seas and  oceans  should the enemy emerge to  challenge it;  the other  should  be fitted with bulges and thus rendered  comparatively torpedo proof, in  order- to discharge the  functions of an Inshore Aggressive Fleet.     11.  Specimen tables of both, these fleets  in comparison with the High. Sea Fleet are appended.* The best and fastest ships are taken to form the Blue Water Fleet, but their numbers are restricted  to what is necessary for  them to  fight a battle  in waters of their own choosing, and not close to the enemy&apos;s coasts.  The Inshore Fleet is composed of second best ships  with; larger numbers of older vessels. Only the British, French, and American navies have been drawn upon, and any vessels  obtained from Russia, Italy, or Japan would. be additional.     12.  It would, be necessary, by a Naval Convention between all the  Allies, to  agree  that whatever  losses.,  were; incurred  in the-
  further stages of the war should be shared pro rata, so that if the  losses fell unequally in particular navies,  or if. their ships were  selected for the most dangerous duties, the  relative strength of tho  various signatory Powers  would not  be affected  at  the close of  the war.      13. The objects.of inshore operations are to fight the enemy, to  harass him constantly, to occupy and dominate his attention, to force : him  to  recall many of his submarines for his own defence, to  provoke him to  engage in frequent action both with his flotillas and  heavier vessels,  and generally to beat him into port;  and thereafter  to mine him in closely with minefields so dense as to be a serious  obstruction to submarines, and to keep him mined in by fighting  and sinking any vessels he may send to sweep a channel.   In short,  to  carry put,; in spite of the submarine, and by means  of special  equipment, the  old, well-recognised, true war policy  of  the Royal  Navy.      14. It must here be: observed that the  policy lately adopted of  scattering mines, and sowing minefields a considerable distance out  at  sea, which are subsequently left unwatched  and unguarded, is  open to question.  The enemy cannot be prevented from sweeping  good broad  channels  through  these  minefields&apos; which  he charts  carefully, and thereafter traverses with - very little  risk, either  with  submarines or surface vessels.  We, on the other hand, are naturally  shy of approaching  our own; minefields, and we  do not  know what  channels he has swept through them.  Our movements are therefore  hampered, which is especially serious for the stronger  fleet, while  the: enemy is not  only &quot;not prevented  from&apos; moving, but  has his  coast largely protected for him by our agency.    &apos;\ A minefield which is not watched and guarded is a barrier only  to those who lay it.      .15.: Before describing in  general terms the  kind  of inshore  operations necessary to naval  offensive, a  new feature of  naval  warfare must be noted, viz., the submarine barrage.  We rightly do  not think it. good  enough to send 3,O00,O00Z.  vessels unprotected  against  torpedoes   into  submarine-infested areas.   It is a  fair; - conclusion that the enemy, with his fewer  ships, shares  our views.  The display of submarines, therefore,  acts as an effective deterrent  on the movement of the best ships. &apos; Undetected, submarines are an  ambuscade.   Observed, they are a veto. (This  was shown, on the  25th December, 1914, to  some extent, when Commodore Tyrwhitt  remained for several hours in the Heligoland Bight during the raid  on Cuxhaven, shielded only by a few submarines.)  But now scores :- of  submarines are available instead of eight or ten; and therefore it  is possible, by interposing a &quot;barrage,&quot; or curtain of submarines, to  isolate pro tern a particular area in which operations are to proceed,  and to make it not worth while for the enemy&apos;s best  ships to try to - Interfere with them.      The respective roles  of minefields and submarines, separately  and  in conjunction, require  most  careful  co-ordination, and  the  difficulties are well known.  But either or  both may be made to  serve the  same, purpose, viz., keeping the enemy V best  ships at a  distance whilst a particular job is being done.   .    ;  [773]  V   ;^-;.:                        ^V;:/   0
    It should be realised that the large numbers of submarines now-available offer altogether new possibilities.both to.us and the enemyfor holding  off the main fleets while landing  operations are inprogress.  Invasion problems as well as the taking of small islandsare.both affected.  .    16. To  sum  up,  the  situation which led to the policy of thedistant blockade has now been modified in at least four fundamentalconditions favourable or unfavourable.  On the one hand-    (a.) The pressure  of the blockade has not  caused the enemy           either to make peace or to come out and fight at sea, and           there is no  evidence that he will do so,    (&amp;.) The submarine attack on our commerce imposes a time-.           limit on our power to continue the war.On the other     (c.) Our naval force has so greatly increased that it is  possible           to provide  a powerful&apos; fleet for. inshore;  action without         v- prejudice to the strength of the fleet needed to secure the           general command of the seas.    (d.) Our  numerical  superiority  in  destroyers  (with -the           Americans)  has  now greatly  increased, and  further           there is the &quot;submarine barrage&quot; facilitating landings.,           It is therefore at.once necessary and possible  to resume           the policy of close and aggressive blockade as an addition           to and not as a substitute  for our existing policy.               But in order that this maybe done, it is indispensable          to secure by one method or another  a serviceable overseas          base.  Without this no naval offensive in any effective.          form is possible.                       ..                           APPENDIX.                           &apos;    The following tables are, of course-, only illustrative : -    No doubt a better allocation of ships could be made.  Theyshow, however, two Dreadnought battle fleets, each of which is morepowerful in numbers and in gun power than  the German Dread-nought fleet.    Large deductions can be made from  the  Inshore Fleet here setout without affecting the basis of the argument, which by no meansrequires  that this Inshore Fleet should  at all times be at sea  insuperior force to the whole German fleet..    If the comparison were extended to pre-Dreadnoughts, the Allied;preponderance in this class would be no less great.    Similar tables can, if desired, be- prepared showing our immense -superiority in light cruisers, and destroyers.: ;v       ;-,

All  attempts to unfold the method of a  naval  offensive must, at this stage, be tentative and general.  It is  to be  observed that the problem is one the details of which must be solved by naval officers.   Further, unless naval commanders of high repute can be found able, and willing to devise, support, and execute such schemes con amove, no action against the.enemy is  possible.  It is for the navy to provide the solution ; and if they are finally convinced that no naval offensive is  practicable, then the considerations as to the. reduction of  naval strength, set forth in  the concluding paragraph. will apply.  It is therefore only possible  to give  certain general indications of a suggestive character. \      18.  The object is to find a means  of fighting and  compelling the enemy to  fight&apos; and so to  cow  his naval  forces, and  then as the  result  of the lighting to  establish a far  greater control of all  sea  approaches to his  harbours.   This   must  be  kept steadily  n  view.-    It  is  probable  that  the enemy  would  not tolerate the laying and maintenance of  watched minefields in fairly close proximity to his&apos;debouches, and that therefore the attempt to do so would  be strenuously resisted.  This  resistance  would  bring about continuous and severe action between the  available forces, leading directly to a decision.  But let us see what the enemy could do in this, the  simplest  case.   The minefield would be laid over- night.   If he sent  out sweepers, our destroyers would sink  them. If he sent out destroyer flotillas, our  flotillas would engage  themi This is  what we want.; If his  fast light  cruisers intervened, we should  meet him with  ours far  more  numerous.  If the waters were.dangerous for one side, they could be made equally dangerous:: for the  other.                                                 r      If  he brings up his heavy ships, he is  in this  dilemma : That the old will  not: be strong enough to face the watching squadrons of our Inshore Fleet, and that the new are too valuable to risk on our &apos; submarine  barrage  and  minefields.   Therefore,  unless  he  has himself  got  ships strong enough to fight  our Inshore Fleet,  so protected by bulges as not to be afraid of  operating in dangerous waters, lie will be unable to support: his flotillas, and,  unsupported, they Will certainly be beaten.   And if his flotillas are beaten, he is:- beaten.                                               &quot;-   &quot;     - 19. But since we seek to operate with flotillas at&apos; a distance of ;250: miles  from, our home bases, while the.enemy would be approximately 50 miles  from his,  we should, as already explained, be at a  disadvantage, which, would go  far to diminish, though, not by any  means  to remove,  our large numerical superiority.  The
 disadvantage would not prevent us from asserting our dead-weight superiority for several - weeks  at a time.  But it would impose, an undue strain if such a position had to be indefinitely maintained. Decisive results in prolonged fighting  are only to be obtained from the possession of an oversea base  or  bases, where  our  flotillas of: destroyers,  submarines,  and small craft could refuel and  rest without the need of  returning: across the North. Sea to the Humber, Harwich, and  the Thames.   The  capture or occupation  of such oversea bases  is, in  itself, a supreme  act of naval  or amphibious aggression against the enemy.  It doubles or  trebles the obligation on him to prevent it.; and if a  base is taken and held, it opens up a whole series of advantageous possibilities, both military and  aerial, additional  to the naval advantages arising from this  argument. These will be indicated later.    - 20. We have now to consider the  possibilities of obtaining an oversea base or bases.     Holland and Denmark,  if they. entered the war  on our side, or alternatively were violated  by  Germany,  would  afford  without fighting  a  variety  of; bases,  of  which the  best  is  probably the Texel.   But  this argument does not  attempt to  deal with such  international possibilities or with,  the  employment of large armies, and is confined to operations primarily naval in their character. No landing  on  the  mainland of  Germany  or in  Denmark is recommended, unless oversea bases  have already  been secured  and the enemy&apos;s naval forces completely beaten and shut out from the North Sea by aggressive minefields.  Therefore, Schleswig-Holstein and Oldenburg are also alike excluded in the  first instance.   There remain only the Frisian Islands and Heligoland.  Of these  islands, which, with. Heligoland, number approximately 17, only three are suitable, viz^, Sylt, Borkum, and Heligoland.  Of  these, Heligoland, though remote from all danger of land gunfire, is the most difficult to take and  miserably small when taken.   But both Sylt and Borkum present very high qualifications, i.e.,    . (a.) They cannot be attacked.from  the mainland, except across       .several miles of sand intersected by.;channels, the  whole          -  flooded twice daily by the tide.  This  means  that they            cannot be attacked at  all,  except  in boats  and from            the sea.     (b.) They cannot be bombarded  at any point by heavy howitzers            or field guns.  .     (c.) They contain deep  water  anchorages (6 to 8  fathoms),          -  sheltered in all weathers, out of range of howitzers or .            field guns, and                                      .     (d.) They are large  enough to  give ample elbow room for all         ;  our purposes once:we have gained them.     21..Some comparisonbetween these islands may here be made (all distances  are in sea miles 2,000 yards).  Sylt, the northern island, is approximately 20 miles long, and varies from 2 miles to % a mile in width.  Borkum is approximately of miles in length by 3-1- in breadth. Sylt is- less strongly; fortified - than  Borkum,  and  its great length must be - utterly disproportionate to  any garrison which it contains.       [773]                                             D
  Therefore the capture of Sylt ought  not to present insuperable  difficulties. - Borkum  is more compact, more heavily fortified, and:  probably  much  more&apos;, strongly garrisoned.   On  the  other,  hand,  the anchorage of Sylt for small draught vessels is on the landward-&quot;- side of the island and nearer to, the mainland than the anchorage.&apos;. of Borkum.           .        &apos;            &apos;.-/;.;&apos;&apos; i      Lister Deep, the heavy&apos; draught  anchorage: of Sylt is  about&quot;.. 26,000 yards from  the mainland,  but  &quot;is  only an open roadstead.  There  is plenty of sheltered water north and  north-east of the  island  14,000  yards distant from the mainland.   An air station in  Sylt in the neighbourhood  of Rote Kliff (about the middle of the  island) would be 24,000 yards from the  mainland, or the German  island  of Fohr.  It would be an 85 miles&apos; flight to Wilhelmshaveh,  50 to Heligoland, and just under 60 to the mouth of the Elbe.  ;  ..      The anchorage of Borkum is  30,000 yards from the mainland&apos;:.&apos;- of Germany;  and an air station in the northern part of the island  would he the same distance from German soil. It  would he within  50 miles&apos; flight of Wilhelmshaven, 55 from Heligoland, and 60 from  the mouth of the Elbe.   &apos; &quot;         .          &apos;      The capture of Sylt would threaten Schleswig and  react on  Denmark ; and the capture of Borkum  would threaten Emden and  Oldenburg and react on Holland.   Borkum is about 240 miles and  Sylt about .310 from Harwich.   &apos; -     .: Both islands are of the highest strategic  value.  On the whole  Borkum is more worth having,&quot; though Sylt is  the easier to get.     . The  storming  and  capture of  any of  these Frisian Islands  constitutes a  difficult feat of arms.  But  the operations are  on  a  small scale compared to such immense enterprises as the capture  of the  Vimy  or  the Messines  Ridges.    The numbers  of   men  involved  are  inconsiderable, and  this  argument  proceeds on the  basis that no naval  unit necessary for  our main  supremacy at sea  will, at any period,  he  endangered. &apos; On the other hand, failure  would  be clear-cut and  glaring.   The strength  of  the  German  garrisons  maintained  on  their sea coast is, of &quot;course, largely  a  matter of conjecture.  On this  point the  Intelligence Department  must speak.   But at this  stage  it is assumed that the permanent -. garrison of Sylt does not exceed from 3,000 to 5,000 men,  and that  of Borkum from 7,000 to 16,000 men, and these, in both cases,.not /  field but fortress  troops. :rIt: may be  estimated, on this assumption,  that  one  division would he sufficient  to capture Sylt,  and two  divisions  to capture Borkum.   &apos;      It might  well  be found desirable to attack Sylt first, and then &apos;. while we were establishing ourselves there and alt the enemy&apos;s forces  and attention were directed to that point,&apos; to launch a second attack  at Borkum.                 .           -&quot; &apos;-- -      22. Both these specific operations, apart from the general policy,  .  should,.of course, be remitted to.the joint study of the  military and  naval staffs..  But,  if  desired, further  preliminary details can be  given,- including estimates  of the  forces required, specification of  the apparatus and equipment, selection  of the points  and method  of attack,, and of the chronological sequence of the various operations.
                         Broadly speaking, however,  the method of  attack  should  be as                         followsi                        -           -C                     :      (a.)&apos;The.cutting off of the island/and. of the attacking  forces                                  -from  the  intervention of  the main German  fleet by-                                    means of either minefields laid overnight between the        .                            islands and. the enemy&apos;s naval harbours, or by submarine                                    barrages similarly established, or, again, by the employ-          -        -                  ment  of both, one behind the other,  at an  interval of,                                    say 10 miles.

In  addition a  number (say)  50,                                    tank-landing lighters would be provided,  each  carrying                                    a tank or tanks, fitted for wire-cutting in its bow, which,                                    by means of a drawbridge or shelving bow, would land 1                                 :  under its own power, to prevent the infantry from&apos;being                                  -\  held up  by wire when attacking the gorges of the forts                                    and batteries.   This is a new feature, and removes one                                    of the very great previous difficulties, namely, the rapid                                   . landing of field artillery to cut wire.    -V;^   .&apos; -                             (d.) The prompt establishment on the island of an aerial base                                    sufficiently powerful to hold  its own air  and maintain                                    artillery observation.   : ....       &apos;                             (e.) The establishment of oilers and storeships in the anchorage,                                   . and the  landing of  the necessary stores, both for the                 ..-         r ;   -  :&quot;  troops and for the flotillas operating from the island.                             23. It is  necessary  at  this point, to refer to the following                         argument: &apos;* If we can  capture a  very  strongly-fortified  place                         240 miles from home,  why cannot the Germans retake it when it is                         only 60 miles  from  them, and the fortifications  weakened or even                         -destroyed in the process  of  capture ?&quot;. The  answer  is  three-fold.                         First, the initiative of attack  and the choice of place rest with us.               &quot;.  -        &apos;Tlie enemy cannot tell which island or which part of &quot;his  coast we                         are going  for, or  whether  we are  going at all, or whether any /,v     -               preparation  we have  made may  not  be a mere bluff designed to -.v;                         induce him to dissipate sorely-needed  forces on coastal  defence.                       :. Nor does he know when we shall come.  We, on the other  hand,                         having taken the  island, know exactly  what  we have to hold, and                         the great need of  the enemy to retake it..  Secondly, it is not intended0                :-:to take these islands merely for the pleasure of  holding them, but\  -                   :y::  only as an essential step in the development of - a Naval  and Aerial            -             offensive, which, must  be accompanied by  hard fighting at every step.                         Thirdly, we are superior to the enemy, in-all classes of vessels.  He
cannot attempt recapture from the sea until he: has overcome ournaval forces.   That he should attempt to overcome those naval forcesis exactly.what we  most earnestly desire ; for,then that series offlotilla, cruiser, and submarine actions will  arise, with  heavy losseson both sides, from which we hope to obtain a decision.     To take, and hold  islands  in any quarter of the world is theprerogative of the stronger Naval Power alone. ;-:                 v.     24. The defence of the island or islands when  captured restson the following processes :-    .(a.) The  superiority in all  respects of our sea forces, having           regard,  inter alia, to the impracticability of the enemy        . .  bringing 3,000,000Z. naked  ships into areas infested by-----         our submarines or  by our minefields, which we will not           allow him to sweep with small craft.     (b.) The impossibility of a military attack across the tide-swept           sands against our infantry  forces holding the island:       y   having  regard  to the impossibility  of the attackers-           digging trenches  at any point on the wide space to he           crossed, or remaining there without being caught by the           tide; and also having regard to the enemy&apos;s inability to           bombard our  infantry positions either by  field  guns or           howitzers.             &apos;     25. There remains (c) the power of the enemy to bring up long range naVal gunsjon .the mainland, and so harass and, if possible,. render untenable our anchorages at the captured islands.  On this it is to  be  observed :-    - (i.) That the nearest  point where such guns could be mounted         /r is at least 30,000 and probably, since they would not be        ; ;  placed  on the  actual beach,  33,000  or  34,000 yards           distant from  our  anchorage at Borkum,  and at least            14,000  plus  3,000  or  4,000 yards  distant   from our            anchorage  at Sylt.-     (ii.) Guns capable of throwing shells this: distance cannot be           easily  or  quickly  brought into  position.  Either they         ... are on  railway mountings and  can  be located from the           air, or regular emplacements must  be built which is a            matter  of weeks and perhaps months.     (hi.)  With aerial  supremacy conferring good aerial observation            and with superior gun  power from the outset, it should            be possible to prevent these. hostile guns from being           . brought into position  or mounted, and to quell their            fire should they be mounted.   Six  or seven monitors,            mounting twelve or fourteen of  the heaviest guns in the           world,  suitably disposed around either island  sitting on            the shoals  at low water should, with good  aerial obser-            vation, by concerted  fire make it impossible for any         -serious attack by  enemy long-range guns to be made or   .         maintained.                 -     (iv.)  Assuming that we  maintain aerial supremacy, which is            an essential condition  even if  it is  limited to the air
                                  - above the island, the enemy&apos;s  long-range fire when or                                 .  in  so far as  it was not quelled,  would be extremely   :                               .inaccurate.  The use of smoke screens would, veil the**  -.                               anchorage and. any desired part of the island in mist                                   and obscurity. (At the present time, and for nearly two                                   years past  the  Germans  have had a heavy gun in                                   position to shell Dunkirk and  all our large  naval estab-                                   lishments there at a less range than would he possible                                   at  Borkum,  yet  they have not found  it expedient to                                   continue the fire in view of reprisals, and the annoyance,                                   such  as it is, has  not  produced  any  military result.                                   The two 14-inch monitors at the Dardanelles succeeded                                   in dominating the Asiatic guns as  soon  as their; obser-                                   vation was perfected.)                          :  Ttefireof suchdistantgiins,.directed not at the vessels in the                        anchorage but at large upon the islands, would be wholly ineffective                        and not worth considering in  its  effects  upon  infantry scattered                        about in strong entrenchments, among the sand dunes.                          .  26.: Finally,  in this section of the argument, lies the question   -                     of communications.  As  wc  are superior at sea and would  he                        seeking to demonstrate  that fact  by action  on  every  possible                        occasion, it would not be  possible for the enemy, unless he defeated                        our sea  forces,  to interfere with  our communications by means                        of surface vessels of any kind.  There  remains  the  Submarine...          7          : :  Such  submarines, be it observed, would  necessarily  be to a large                        extent withdrawn from their present  attack  upon  our merchant                        shipping, giving  us thereby the very relief we seek,  and would-be  .v-,                        recalled for the far more difficult task of. attacking escorted military             7          vessels  in the, fighting  zone.:   Every.; method  of anti-submarine                      -warfare which is now dispersed over  such wide and various areas                        would he applied in a concentrated form for. the maintenance of                        these  communications.   We are at the present moment, and have                        been  for many months past, maintaining the  continuous supply of                        very large armies across the  channel to Boulogne,  Calais,  and                        Dunkirk,  the last  of  which places is little  more than half the                        distance from the  enemy&apos;s nearest  submarine; and destroyer base                        that  Borkum  is from Wilhelmshaven.  The  naval and  military                 .7:-;7;  forces that we should  be maintaining on these islands would he &apos;                        incomparably  smaller than  those  which  are  now supplied  from             ::       ;:.  Dunkirk.   In  fact, they  might  be  almost entirely maintained  by                     ,&quot;  torpedo-proof supply vessels.  At the worst, we should be fighting ..                        the same  submarines that  are  now raiding our trade  routes, but                        fighting them for a positive military  object and in waters of our                        own choice.  Every  step in this naval offensive should  result in                        forcing the enemy to concentrate his  submarines in a definite area                        and  in enabling us  to  concentrate  our overwhelming  but now                        scattered and dissipated resources against them.                            27. The  critical nature of this operation at its supreme moment,W..-.:viz., the storming of the  island  must not  be underrated.   A check                    .7.  at this stage  might entail disastrous  results.  We must not forget   .                        the power of the  modern rifle and machine gun  in the hands of       r                      [773]                                           E
 -troops whose trenches and moral have not been completely shattered by prolonged artillery preparation.   Although it should be possible to support the assaulting troops by the  fire  of  300 or 400 guns,. many of the  heaviest calibre, all firing from  decisive ranges, this kind of  artillery support could not  be equal either in accuracy or duration to the artillery preparations now employed on the western front; nor could  we  expect a creeping barrage  from  floating platforms and naval artillerists.  There is always the danger of the enemy getting wind of  our  intentions and reinforcing his garrisons with good troops beforehand, at any rate,  so far as Borkum, about which he would always be  very  sensitive, is concerned.  On the other  hand, the  landing could  be  effected under the  shields of lighters, proof against machine-gun  bullets, and too numerous to be seriously affected by heavy gun-fire ;  and the employment of Tanks in. even larger numbers-than. are. here  suggested,  especially the quick: moving. Tanks,, and slighter -varieties operating  in  an /area where no preparations  could, have  heen made to  receive  them. These may bethought new and important favourable considerations.     From, the moment: the -troops  are  landed until  the  , capture is complete, this part of the  operation  is mainly, military in  its character, and it  remains to be seen  whether a sound  plan of attack can :be  devised- by  military -authorities  which woulol  within a. few days , of.;the. landing  being effected,  put.. an  end to  all resistance on the island.  It is certain that the. enemy has  been continually strengthening his defensive  arrangements  along the whole coast, ever-since the outbreak of war, and - although the means of attack have grown more. rapidly in many respects than those of the defence, the hazard of the operation is obvious.  If the assaulting troops - were  brought finally to a  standstill  on  the island before we had.the,use.of.its anchorages as naval bases, the whole, enterprise might miscarry, and a limited, though heavy price be paid both in men and ships.... But what are we  paying now and what shall we pay next year.for- a negative policy ?    ... ..            .  -   -   .  * 28.  Reviewing all   the  foregoing  considerations,  which,  have been set  out not so: much to prescribe details as to illuminate-the subject,  it seems  desirable; to - ;put forward,1 in  the hope that it may receive simultaneous examination,. a third alternative.    . No  naval, offensive  is practicable without an Oversea Base.  If the  capture  and  retention of this  base  are not to  involve  large armies, it must be on an island. - If we  cannot borrow an island from neutrals; and. dare not  take one from the enemy, the question arises,&quot; can wc make an island.&quot;                :/. . -     Only persevering  study  of  this project should - justify its dismissal. . If it  could  be.  done without undue  consumption  of materials, the cost. and trouble of  it must be. balanced  against the hazards and heavier stakes of the  oversea assault upon a fortified hostile position.               ,.     .  .              .           .-.   -  29.. The  sandbanks of the Horn  Reef, are, in  fact, a barely submerged island.  They may,be found capable of being improved anddeveloped into a torpedo-proofwar anchorage, which, could be used as an advanced Oversea Base both for replenishing and resting
-our destroyer flotillas, and possibly for sheltering  medium vessels.The suitable areas of the Horn Reef lie about 20 miles west of theneutral Danish Coast, near the important  landing  place of Esbjerg,-and more than 40 miles from the  nearest German territory.  It istherefore  out  of  the  furthest  gun-shot  from  Germany.   Anyviolation of Danish, territory by Germany would give us a right totake protective measures by  seizing one of  the  excellent Danishbases which, are available.  Therefore, we may assume that it wouldnot  be  worth  Germany&apos;s  while  to  do  this.  The waters  ofHorn Reef vary in  depth, from 8 feet to 50 feet, and the reef itselfgives good protection from the northerly gales.  This area is about90 miles from Heligoland.  It is therefore not too distant for ourdestroyers to work from.  It is also near enough  for an aggressive.air base.     30. One  of the methods  suggested  for  investigation  is asfollows:  A sufficient number of flat-bottomed barges  or caissonsmade, not of  steel  but.of concrete, should  be prepared in theHumber, at Harwich, and in the Wash,  the Medway, and Thames.These structures would be adapted to the depths in which they wereto  be sunk according to a  general plan.  They would float whenempty  of water, and could thus be towed across to the site of theartificial island. On arrival at the buoys marking the island, sea cockswould be opened and they would settle down on the  bottom.   Theycould subsequently be gradually filled  with sand  as  opportunityserved with suction dredgers.   These structures would  range insize from, (say), 60&apos;X 40&apos;X 20&apos;to 120&apos;X 80&apos;X 40&apos;.   By this means atorpedo and weather-proof harbour, like an atoll,  would be createdin the open sea. with regular pens for the destroyers and submarines,and alighting platforms for aeroplanes.     This project, if feasible, is  capable  of great elaboration, and itmight be applied in various places. - Concrete vessels can perhaps bemade  to  carry a  complete heavy  gun  turret, and these, on theadmission of  water to their outer chambers would sit on the  seafloor, like the Solent Forts, at the  desired points.   Other sinkablestructures could be made to contain store-rooms, oil-tanks, or livingchambers.  It is not possible, without an expert inquiry, to do morehere than indicate the possibilities which embrace nothing less thanthe creation,  transportation in pieces, assemblement and posing ofan artificial island and destroyer base.              .     31. Such a scheme, if found mechanically sound, avoids the need of employing troops and all the risks of storming a fortified island.  It could be  applied as a  surprise, for although the  con- struction of these  concrete vessels would probably be known in Germany, the natural conclusion would be that  they were  intended for an attempt to block up the river mouths, which indeed  is an idea not to be excluded.   Thus, until the island or  system of  breakwaters actually began to grow, the enemy  would not  penetrate  the design.     A yeafs  preparation would, however, be required.   \ 32. No attempt is made here to describe the exact method of -carrying out the general operation  of seizing either Borkum or Sylt
 establishing a base at the Horn  Reef; but the sequence of thedn phases may be stated:-    &quot;       &apos;    &apos;  (a.) On a given day, called Zero, all merchant traffic with: these         islands is suddenly greatly restricted and the ships held         in port.  That night begins  the concentration of the         flotillas&apos;of attack.   These will he drawn in part  from         the  escorting and convoying duties on the trade routes,.         in part from the Grand  Fleet, and  from  Dover  and         Harwich.   They will comprise a  destroyer  force twice         as strong in numbers and four times as strong in gun         power as  the German -flotillas.  A similar concentration         of British  submarines and of  small&apos;craft of all kinds,         sloops, drifters, patrol vessels, &amp;c, will take place.  (&amp;.) On the third night, or whenever  sufficient force has been      -   assembled,  the  isolation  of  the proposed base  from         Germany by. an extensive process of laying mine-fields      :  will be effected.  These mine-fields will be guarded by         the flotillas which come into action  from the third day,         with seven  days&apos;  radius.  The actual attack  on the       .  proposed  base,  or, in the case of  the Horn Reef, its         construction,: will then begin.   The Blue Water Fleet         suspends refits, and the Inshore Fleet takes up its station         to  sustain the  flotillas  and  cover and  support  the         operations.  (c.) Within five  or six days after  the attack oiling facilities  .   :&apos;;..&apos;./  must be available at the new base for the first relief of         the flotillas.             Until flying stations can be established  on the sands         of the new base the aeroplane control and observation         must be maintained from seaplane ships.  (d.) It  is   probable  that  the German submarine forces are         divided into three parts : :.               (1.) Those out hunting.               (2.) Those in refitting.               (3.) Those reserved for home  defence.             During  the first week we shall only have to deal         with the third of these classes.  The  first will be still         waiting on their beats for merchant traffic, and the second         will be in dockyard hands.  Butf rom the tenth day onwards         we must anticipate the recall of the  commerce attacking         submarines and the  hurried  re-equipment of  those         refitting.  But by that time it is hoped  that the main         part  of the  work  will  he achieved, and  a sheltered         anchorage with re-fuelling facilities, the whole properly         netted  and  surrounded  by  an  extensive  system of.         mines, will have been created, although not, of course,&apos;         completed. .  (e.) If  the  above  assumptions were correct, it is probable that         about the tenth day we could afford-
                (i.) To make a further concentration in the area of                       anti-submarine vessels of all kinds;  and                (ii.) To resume our merchant traffic.                The phase  of submarine  fighting to prevent  the          . -  occupation, construction, completion,  and victualling of            the new base would have&quot; begun, and until this phase had            reached a decision one way or the other it is unlikely that            the enemy would resume commerce raiding on any large            scale.  His energies would he concentrated on defending            himself from a direct attack, the full scope and intention            of which he  could not possibly measure.     33. What can the enemy do to  prevent the  execution of such a plan?                         -  \/.;^;^y&quot;&apos;;/:;;-;^;::;&apos;;.7V:.:;:;^7:;:;:7   .  There: is only one  thing which he  can do, and  it  is the one thing that we want him to do.  He can fight.   No  doubt he will recall numbers of his submarines from our trade routes to attack our  transports  and  supply vessels  of  all  kinds.   We shall meet   this  by  the fullest use  of all  the  means  of   counter attack  which have, been  and  are  being developed.   He.  will send  out  Zeppelins to drop bombs.   These  will be  attacked by our aeroplanes, starting from seaplane ships.   He might send out his destroyer  flotillas  to make night  attacks.  These, again,: will  be  attacked  by our  stronger flotillas, and  fierce, confused fighting will ensue,  resulting, as we  have a right to. expect, on a survey of numbers and, gun power, in his flotillas being worsted and driven off.   In order to  clear a way  for his  heavy slnps through our minefields,  he will send but mine-sweepers and other harrier-breaking craft,  more of: less  strongly supported.  Wo shall  encounter  all these  with similar, but superior, forces.  Further: severe and continuous - action will  ensue.  Do  let us  hold  fast to  the simple truth that the stronger Navy can  assert  its rights over the weaker, and that all it requires to demonstrate  its  rights  is  continued compulsion : of the weaker  to action.  We  can pursue  a policy of ship for ship Josses to any extent.  He cannot pursue it  except for a very  limited time.  We could even afford mathematically, to lose two. ships for one, with the  certainty that he would not be  able to continue.   With forces of approximately equal strength and quality, manoeuvring gives the victory, but,  with overwhelming superiority, mutually destructive fighting is the surest road.-     34. But, it will he said, the enemy will at some point  in these operations least convenient to you, send out his whole fleet, sweeping his  way forward  and protected  by  all his flotillas.  His superior speed and manoeuvring power will enable him certainly to bring our slow-moving Inshore Fleet to battle under conditions where all  the manoeuvring power which speed gives rests with  him.  In thinking this aspect.out, we must first consider the: strength of the  Inshore Fleet.  This fleet would contain many of the most heavily gunned Dreadnoughts or  super-Dreadnoughts in the world, with as many        [773]    .                                         F
older battleships as we think  it right  to employ.   The destructionof such a force by gunfire cannot  be achieved  except at the cost ofalmost enual sacrifices and  of many hours of  battle.  Though ourInshore Fleet would not steam more than 7 or 8 knots  an  hour, ourunder-water anxieties would  be incomparably less than  his.   Hewould  have  to  come  into waters  which  we had systematicallyorganised with our minefields, and  expose  his naked  ships of thegreatest value to the attacks of -large  numbers of  our  submarines,who would  have  full  warning  of the  advance.   His  losses  inthe  approach  could  not  fail  to  be  very  serious,  and  mightleave him equal  or actually inferior by the time the main battle wasjoined.   After  the battle  he would  have  to return, in  all thedisorder of the conflict, through the same dangerous waters, mine-fields and submarine barrages through which he had come.  Allthe  time  our own fast Blue Water Fleet, showing an  actualsuperiority in numbers alone of  3  to 2, would remain intact  and,if it pleased, entirely outside the area of  the conflict.   Finally, thechoice of  the battle  ground would, within  certain limits, rest withus.   We  should know, by constant aerial observation,  exactly whenthe German Main Fleet was  leaving harbour.  We  should knowthat it could only be coming out at  such great risk to fight ourInshore Fleet, or such squadrons of it as were at sea.  Assumingthat his fleet steam twice as  fast as our Inshore Fleet, we could, ifwe  wished before we were  overtaken, add  50 per  cent, to ourdistance from his base  at the time of  his advance.  Assuming thatthe  cruising station of  this  fleet were  about  90   miles  fromWilhelmshaven,  we could force the enemy to fight,  if we chose,approximately,  140 miles  from  port.  If  he steamed  15 knotsfrom the time he  left  harbour,  which  is  all he could  doin company,  nine hours would pass before battle could be joinedBy  that  time our fast Blue Water  Fleet, moving  from the  Forth,could, if it desired, be very near the scene.  The conclusion of thisargument is that the German High Sea Fleet would  not be riskedon  such  a hazardous  enterprise.  If it were we could ask  fornothing better.     If, on the other hand, the High Sea Fleet is not employed, butonly. small  craft supported  by  old  battleships  with or  withoutbulges, then our  superior Inshore  Squadron  and  stronger flotillas -will certainly break these up and defeat them, and the longer thematter is disputed the better for us.     35. Let us now endeavour to compute  some of the advantagesthat would follow from the kind of operations described  above, ifthey had been successfully executed.  . :  :     From the moment when we attacked and  invaded German soil,or  established a naval  base.in close  proximity to his coasts, andthus brought our great naval superiority into play, the operation,small though it be compared  to the gigantic battles on&apos; the Westernfront, would  demand and; rivet the attention  oi! the enemy and  ofthe world in general, and particularly of the  two  small States,Denmark and  Holland,&apos; which  lie so.  near  to the  new theatre.Germany, at the very outset,  would have to choose whether to risk
 and consume the whole of her sea forces in continuous action with our attacking fleet  and flotillas,  or whether  to retire through,  the Canal while time remained with almost all her naval forces, and be content  to  retain the command of the Baltic.   If she took  the former course, that  should be  very  agreeable to the Royal Navy, for then would  follow  a continuous struggle  by submarines, by destroyers,  by mining, by cruiser  fighting, by aerial fighting, and by supporting ships, proceeding from crisis to  crisis till a definite decision was reached.  All the time our Blue Water Fleet, sufficient in itself  to assure the supremacy  of  the ocean and  the broad seas, would remain, safe and  intact like the gold reserve in the Bank of England, as  the  ultimate guarantee.  If, on the other hand,  the Germans, after a certain amount of fighting, finding  that  their numerical inferiority did not allow them to sustain losses which they could  not replace and which,  unit for unit, must be more severe having regard to their  relatively  smaller  numbers, should allow themselves to be driven back into  their harbours and river mouths, an alternative situation of very great advantage would be created. We should proceed :-     (a.) By sea. To mine them in ever closer and closer, blocking       -  .   particularly all those channels which  are deep  enough            for submarines to come  out  and  go in by.   Great            numbers of  mines set at different depths,  or  strung            together  in necklaces, would be laid on a comparatively            small arc before the enemy&apos;s debouches, but at a sufficient            distance  from his  batteries;   and  these  would   be            effectively  watched  and  guarded.   We  should sweep           and buoy channels through the existing  fouled ground           up to our blockading minefields, and thus Ave should  be           able to pass about  this dangerous area, the dangers of           which would  soon become mysterious and prohibitive to           the enemy.  There is scarcely  any limit  to the mining           policy which, could then be pursued.    (6.)  By air. This is, in itself, almost a sufficient object.  We           should establish on the captured or improvised island           aerial stations and  bombing bases of  a very powerful          . character, and from these, in easy striking distance  of           the most  important  military  and  naval  places  in           Germany, we should levy a continued  bombing attack.           Essen,  Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, Kiel, the whole  line      -     of the Canal, all  the  dockyards, all the anchorages           would  be brought  under continuous bombing by night          and day from quite short distances.  Aerial observation          would reveal each morning the exact disposition  of the           German fleet, in each of its harbours or  rivers, and  at          either  side of  the  Canal.  Every movement  of  the          enemy would be known.    Until we have beaten the enemy&apos;s sea forces into port,  andhave mined  them in  there, and  have established  a  serviceableoversea base from which to keep him mined in and blockaded, it  is-       [773]                                           G
 useless to think of&apos;-invading  Schleswig, or- throwing-an army into-Jutland.&apos;; Unless we can d ef end: Denmark with&apos; an army we have no right to bring her in to her ruin.   Until she comes in, it is unwise, if not impossible, to enter the Baltic.     But once the operations here suggested had been  achieved, we should be in a position, if we thought fit, to invite  both Holland and Denmark to join the coalition  against  Germany, and to- support either or both of them by adequate armies either in Holland  or Denmark, or conceivably we could ourselves invade Schleswig.     36. One more result that would follow from the success of these naval operations must be noted.     The  effective mining in and close blockading  of the debouches into the North. Sea would remove the last possibility of invasion  or serious raid on  the British, islands.  It is  absurd to  suppose a military expedition could be despatched from Kiel  through the Belts and the Skaw.   Its  interception would be certain.  Therefore all the troops hitherto held in  Great Britain for  this already remote contingency would be released for offensive action.  The garrisons of the captured island or islands  could be found from home.  It would not  be  necessary  to weaken  our army in France for this purpose.         &apos;.y,&apos; - --.- -     &apos;      &apos;     Further, the whole of the Home  forces would be  available, for invasiohary action and come at once into play, and it would be easy to lead the enemy to suppose that a great  operation  was impending of which, the capture of an overseas base was, as well  it might be, only the first stop.   This would increase the  inducement upon him to fight at sea and to divert  troops from the main front.  We must, moreover, assume that such  a naval operation as has been indicated would be synchronised  with the supreme  offensive  of the British, -French, and  American armies on the Western  front.  It  might thus be made to take the form, apart from its  own merits,  of an immense  diversion  of  the  enemys  strength at  the most - critical moment.  He might find himself forced, under the threat of invasion which might occur at so many points and. on  so  wide a front,  to withdraw forces utterly out of all proportion  to  those  we should have to employ in the island operation, and this fact  in itself might exercise  an all-important influence  on the great  battles  on the Western front, and consequently upon the fate of the war.     37. All the various schemes and arguments set out in this paper have only one object, namely, to discover for the Navy a method of offensive which will  enable  it  to make  the immense surplus  force which it possesses tell effectively at the  culminating  moment in this war.   A layman  can only assemble arguments,  point out the needs, and  suggest expedients.    No scheme bias any chance  of  life or-success that the Navy does not take up, elaborate, and champion itself.   The  difficulties  of  positive  and  creative  action  are enormous.  Nothing is more easy in this matter than for experts to remain entrenched  upon a  negative  policy,   and receive  every proposal with a fire of destructive criticism.  But, if these ideas and other variants  of them are rejected, if no alternative proposition  is put forward by the Naval Service, and;1 if it is&quot;finally settled by the
overwhelming consent of  expert opinion that no means of a navaloffensive exist or can;be devised;  that the. war:can only he won onland, and that the  Allied navies,  however  great  their; superiority,can only &quot; keep the ring &quot; and  hunt submarines  with small craft,then the following conclusion emerges with extreme plainness, viz.,that the large ships of all classes maintained  in commission by theAllied navies ought not to exceed the minimum necessary to dischargethis limited role.   We  do  not want upwards of  200 battleshipscontinually  maintained  in full  commission  to &quot; keep the ring.&quot;Every trained officer or man, every gun, every round of ammunition,every ton of stores, and every shilling of expense  should he madeto  play  some  part  of  definite  war  utility.   Keeping  in  fullcommission great numbers of vessels which are surplus, which arenot needed for any  definite, war  purpose  at a time when menare being sent back after three wounds  to the firing line, cannot bejustified on any ground.   Unless, therefore, some form of navaloffensive, which utilises the surplus strength of  the  Allied navieseffectively can be devised, the proportion of Allied resources in men,money, and material which should be assigned to the upkeep of thebattle fleets stands clearly in need of the strictest scrutiny.     38. Conclusions.     (i.) At the  beginning of the war our margin of Dreadnoughtsuperiority in Home Waters was. 7.  It is now  22 ; to which may beadded the  14 American Dreadnoughts, making in  all a  numericalsuperiority of 36.    - But  our superiority in  quality and especially gun  power farexceeds our superiority in numbers, the additions consisting chieflyof the most powerful vessels ever built.   .     The formation of two. fleets for the separate purposes of blue-water and inshore fighting is now possible.     (ii.) A method has been discovered  whereby ships may, at asacrifice in spesd, obtain a high degree of immunity from torpedoattack.     (iii.) The multiplication of our submarines enables barrages ofsubmarines to be thrown  between the enemy&apos;s heavy ships and  anyvessels wre wish to use  in  any  particular area.   These barrages-constitute adequate deterrents, if not absolute vetos,  on  the move-; ment of heavy non-bulged ships.     (iv.) Our  superiority in destroyers  and small craft  is over-whelming, if it  were not dissipated  by a purely defensive strategy.     (v.) We are therefore in a position to resort to the traditionalwar policy  of.  the-Royal Navy, viz., to beat the enemy&apos;s flotillas into  port,  and keep  him closely  mined and blockaded there  by-stronger flotillas properly supported by torpedo-proof  heavy ships.     (vi.) To carry out this policy effectively it is necessary to obtain an oversea  base where our  flotillas can refuel,  &amp;c,  and whence aeroplane observation and attack can be constantly maintained upon the enemys principal naval, establishments.     (vii.)  The means  of attack  upon certain  suitable islands have- been greatly improved by various devices and mechanical improve-ments.  On the other hand,  the enemy&apos;s . preparations for  defence-have probably also been improved.
     (viii.) The assumption of such a naval offensive  will  force theenemy to concentrate his submarines-or a large portion of them upon his own defence and  upon military objectives.   We shall beable to  concentrate a  large  proportion  of  our  means  of  attack on.submarines in definite and comparatively restricted war areas with.consequent increase in the  effectiveness of our attack and  collateralrelief to our trade routes.  -   (ix.)  The establishment of  a close and aggressive blockade,supported by an oversea base or bases, will  threaten the enemywith, invasion  either of Schleswig or Oldenburg, and will place itin our power to support either Denmark  or Holland, or both, againsthim.;     (x.) All British troops maintained for Home Defence and otherland forces in this country, numbering  at  least 1%  millions, maythus, without moving from  Great Britain, be made  to acquire a warvalue as a potential invading army.     This will compel the enemy to make  large diversions of strength.from the main front in France, which will greatly assist our militaryoffensive at its supreme - moment.     (xi.) An  oversea base will enable  an  aerial  offensive on thegreatest scale to  be constantly directed upon  almost  all  the vitalmilitary objectives in Germany.     (xii.) If the  naval authorities decide  that no  aggressive navalaction on a great  scale is possible, and  that the fleet can only &quot; keepthe ring,&quot; it then follows that the battle fleets and  cruiser forcesmaintained in commission should  be  strictly limited to what isnecessary for that restricted  role: and the  surplus materiel, stores,and expert personnel  should be released for other purposes.  Theguns  and. ammunition should go  to the front.  The  officers andexpert ratings should  go to the Tanks or to the air, where they aregreatly  needed.July 7, 1917.w.  s.  c.
