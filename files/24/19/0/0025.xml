         ?/AR  CABINET.         -ADEN.Note by the Secretary of State for War.          I have considered the Paper circulated to the WarCabinet by the Secretary of State for India,  dated 29th June1917, on the subject of the transfer from the Government of Indiaof responsibility for the control of.Aden, and I have no objectionto the proposal that the War Office should take over the militarycontrol.          If, however, the military control is transferred toLondon, administrative and political control should, in my opinionbe simultaneously transferred there..  It appears to me obviouslyunsuitable that administrative and political control shouldcontinue to be. vested in the Indian Government after the transferof military control has taken place,  -          With regard to the proposal to place political controlin the Foreign Office, I submit that past experience has shownthat the Foreign Office is.not adequately equipped to controloverseas dependencies, and I yould instance the example of Ugandaand Somaliland.  I therefore suggest the establishment of theCrown Colony form of government for Aden as meeting in the bestmanner.the requirements of military command,  administration, andpolitical supervision.  I do not see that&apos; this should interferewith the efficient handling of the Arab question, and in anycase it is not desirable to base an Imperial organization -political or military - solely upon any one question.                                DERBY.7th July, 1917.  .
