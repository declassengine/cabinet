(Memorandum &quot;by Mr. Duke.) THE ?7AR CABIEST.            During the -oast few weeks the situation in&apos;Ireland with regard to  the latest insurgent movement has; developed sufficiently; to enable me to state a few definite -facts and&apos;to  present  some definite opinions as to the existing situation.;   The  Sinn Fein movement takes two&apos;;forms:-  .             (l)  An avowed propaganda in&quot;favour of&apos; the                      absolute&apos; political independence of                  -&apos;-..-;,&apos;-&apos;:&apos; Ireland &quot;but-without any menace of                      violent measures which would be likely  -                   -   to repel the more softer classes in the                    -&apos;; community. :            ;.(2)  A revolutionary propaganda carried onby                      the moving spirits in the quasi-constitutional                  .-campaign and supported &quot;by them with appeals                      to the fighting forces which to, a greater or                      lesser ^extent seem always to &quot;be awaiting the                      call to action in some parts of Ireland.         -   I  have before me a printed statement of the constitution and aims and  pledge&apos; of membership of the Sinn Fein Organisation. This.document evidences the existence of a &quot;National Council&quot; . and.states  as its objects &quot;the -re-establishment of the Independence of Ireland1&apos;;  &quot;the renunciation of the authority of the British Parliament&quot;;  and&apos;. the use of &quot;any powers&apos; we have,!. or may have at . any.-:-time&apos; in  the -future, - to work for our own advancement: and- for the creation.of a proDperous,&apos;,virile,&apos;: and independent nation&quot;. The aims which  are set-/forth in this- Sinn Fein constitution include the  establishment,temporarily of-art:&apos;Irish assembly in Ireland to  assume control, of. internal&apos; Irish affaire-,&apos; commerce, social  and  industrial,  and to provide for representation of Ireland abroad  by means of &quot;an Irish:Consular Service for the:-advancement&apos; of  Irish Commerce and&apos; Irish interests&apos;;geh&apos;eraily.&quot;  - The paragraphs  in the programme which - are:distinctly&quot; hostile V to dreat- Britain, call for the non-recognition of Acts; of. the British Parliament;   the withdrawal of all voluntary support to &apos;.--.-- the British Armed Forces;  and the n6n-consumption&apos; as far as practicable  of  articles paying duty to the&apos;British Exchequer.&apos;;. The; scheme  if genefally adopted would exclude all Imperial control in  Ireland and would no doubt  effectually pave the way,for the ultimate  object declared by the National Council, namely,   &quot;to  re-establish a Rational Government in Ireland.&quot; The promissory,  declaration required to be signed by members is in these terms:-   &quot;I have read the Rules  and Constitutionspf the  National Council and.I hereby signify my acceptance&quot;of them and my  promise to remain faithful t0  them.&quot;    A quarterly subscription from the members is one  of the conditions  of membershipSCR E  T.
          .  I  think it advisable to deal separately with,the ostensibly  Quasi-constitutional movement and the more ;///- violent  revolutionary activity which are the two agencies now at work in Ireland for the propagation -of- the revolutionary, ideals above mentioned.            The headquarters of the. National&apos;Council of Sinn Fein are at  an address in Dublin where periodical meetings take place.of. a Council of 18- persons. .  Six members&apos;  of  this Council were nominated at a &quot;Convention&quot; held by  Count Plunkett in Dublin in April last. Among these are Count and Countess Plunkettf Mr. Arthur Griffith and  John Hilroy,, the -two latter of whom are- the most active in .organisation and agitation,.. - hix other./.&apos;-&apos;,&quot;v.-. members-have  been appointed GO represent Sinn Fein Clubs, and six  to  represent., another blaso of Club -called Liberty- Clubs.   .The os-ist-ence; side by side -in: this central body of  three sets of  representatives points to the co-operation of  three separate agencies under distinct;leadership. I am not aware at present of the differences &quot;between these leaders,  but  I think as the result of the&apos; best observation I have been able  to make, that the so-called Council includes a  certain number of revolutionists whose programme is  one of resort  to violence but who for the present are. content  to  co-ojerate with men of less extreme views. . Clubs in association with this Council are. being rapidly:and systematically formed in various parts of- the country and especially in the West and some parts of the Midlands and South./-..            The Plunkett. Convention was held on-April 19th in&apos;Dublin.    Its  proceedings were open to the Press and were attended by a large assemblage from all parts of the country. Count Plunkett presided,   Mr. Arthur Griffith was among the principal&apos;speakers, and although- some differences,showed,themselves-between&quot;Count&quot;Plunkett and Mr. Griffith the;:Convention - appears1 lo have been--successful- in. the foundation&quot;of  a new. organisation,   &apos;The meeting took--its -tone from the-proposal made by.the Chairman at the outset &apos;:of a vcte cf honour to-the men .who &quot;&quot;sacrj.fi ced their lives&quot; in the Dublin rebellion.  .  This vote was taken in silence,, the whole audience standing-. ;&quot;; Resolutions insisting upon.Irish -right - of independ- ence and upon representation - at:.the - Peace- &quot;Conference were adopted  and. were  followed by the resolution which.founded the present  scheme - of organisation and which aimed;at the united action  of ,:such bodies as Sinn Fein,  ohe Irish Nation League:the A&amp;ient  Order  of Hibernians (irish- American Alliance),&apos;.--.&apos;. the Irish Volunteers and the Labour Party.  - . The.Irish American section  of  the Ancient Order of Hibernians is an avowedly revolutionary association appealing to the use of force;
 The Irish Volunteers ere the armed &quot;body which  combined. with the &quot;Citizen Army&quot; Ox the Labour.Party in  the Rebellion in  Lublin.  Sinn Fein, the Nation League,-.and the labour ^arty in its proper constitution ere agencies capable of being conducted by constitutional meens.       -      Since this essembly at Lublin meetings for the further-. arice of the objects there resolved upon heve been held in various provincial towns in Ireland. - The prime mover in these activities has been itr. Arthur Griffith.  At a meeting at Kilkenny, where there ei&apos;e a considerable body of ectiye revolutionists, the Town Hall was lent by the Corporation. A large number of &quot;Roman Cetholic^Clergy and of members of locel bodies ?/ere present together with delegates from various perts of Kilkenny end from centres of Sinn Fein activity in the country at large.:-   The Chairman of the meeting (who is the editor of e local paper.very mischievous in its revolu- tioiiary tendencies) stated the objects of the Sinn Fein move- ment in these terms:- &quot;(1)  .Thet we proclaim Irelend to be a &quot;seperate nation;  (Z) That we assert Ireland1a right to freedom &quot;from all foreign control,denying the authority of any foreign ^Perliament to:make lews for Irelend; (3) That we affirm the &quot;r%ht of the Irish People to ceclare their will e/s law end enforce &quot;their decisions in their own land without let or hindrance &quot;from any other country;(4) That maintaining the status of Ulrelend  as a dis-^^-pation^we demand representation at the &quot;Peace Conference;  (b)  That it is the duty of the Hat ions ts.king Tpart in the Peace- Conference to guarantee.the liberty of the &quot;Hations celling for  their  intervention,  releasing the smell &quot;netions from&apos;the  control of the greater  Powers; (6)  That our &quot;claim to  complete, independence is founded on human right &apos;and &quot;the  lew of nations; .&apos;(7J  Thet we declere  that Irelend has never &quot;yielded,  but has  ever  fought egainst foreign rule;  (8) That &quot;we  hereby bind .ourselveswto use every means in our  power to &quot;attain complete - liberty  for our country&quot;.,.      In the course&quot;&quot;of&apos; the proceedings at  the Kilkenny meeting it  was announced thet the conduct of the.Sinn Fein movement &apos; would be vested in  one  central organisation in Lublin end thet by  a  recent arrangement the National Council cf Sinn  Fein end the Committee  appointed at  Count  PlunkettTs Convention would  for the future be  known as  Sinn Fein;  that Mr. Arthur  Griffith was president  and that  all  the  Clubs  to  be  formed should  be affiliated with  Sinn  Fein at tts headquerters in  Dublin.  The most definite of  the-decisions which -appeared in the  proceedings of this Kilkenny-Conference -was that  of working for  the election  of Members of Parliament under pledge to absent&apos;themselves from the House  of Commons end-to combine in political action in  Ireland, .,&apos;..     Material essistence-.has  been, given  to  the  Sinn  Fein prop&amp;-: -:. ganda by- the  sequence   of bye-elections in 1-oscommon,.Long ford end Clare,-., end  the lee&amp;ers  in- -the  agitation, who  appear;:to  heve  large pecuniery resources ct  their  disposal,-,  heve  uoed; the  liberty :oi speech at  election  contests  end the  period of  excitement  which ,.- naturally  arose  upon  the  releese  of  the prisoners  ox  the rebellion  in order  to spread  r&apos;inn Fein  agencies  through those : parts  of the  country where --revolutionary- Irish- activities heve ;; most-adherents.  They else  meintain  that pert of their .prop6gends which admits  oi  statement, within  constitutional  limits by meens. of  a weekly nevspaper -&quot;Nationality&quot;,&apos;, which Is very ably conducted by-Itr.- Arthur- Griffith; end by  two or t.hree:  other papers  aimed  . et  the seme  objects.
       In  tho  favouring  circumstances  to  which I  have  referred it  Is  not surprising  that *Sinn  Fein Clubs  have sprung up in great  numbers in various parts  of Ireland.   The police. report the formation  of upwards of a  hundred in  the period between June  12th  and June  30th and.they state that on.June 30th there were 165 Clubs in existence with a membership of about  11.000.  dome  of these Clubs;are  named simply  the Sinn Fein Club, of  the place in  which  the Club is formed; Some of them, howovor,  arc  designated by such names as &quot;Roger Casement&quot;;  &quot;Patrick  Pearse&quot;j &quot;Tho 0JRa-hilly&quot;, &quot;John  MoDermott&quot;.&apos;  and &quot;Thomas McDohagh&quot;*. -A Club at Borriookano in dounty Tipperary 3tyles Itself &quot;The . Pike Sinn  ein Club&quot;.       The Roman Catholic. Clergy in Ireland put a fairly effective veto upon oath, bound  secret societies, though they, exist, in 6pito of  its  severest; prohibitions.  This oiroumstanco  is taken account, of. by tho  directors of  the Sinn. Fein movement...   I  am informed -  I believe correctly - that in some  cases.a  pledge of  soerocy  is  taken  in these words  by  way  of an additional pledge  to  that of  member&apos;-. ship:-. &quot;I pledge  my  word  that  I.will not  give or disclose any information in. connection with eamo  to unauthorised persons&quot;./           &apos;       V     &apos;.  During  the  last-two  or three weeks a new movement&apos;&apos; of&apos; tho Sinn  Join.loaders has  shown itsolf which has as its object.the collection throughout Ireland of the  signatures of men and women,generally  bo petitions  to be expressed.in the various languages cf  the great Powers  engaged in  &quot;the ..  ... present war with&apos;a view to  the  presentment of these petitions.. at .the Peacaf.  Congress as the universal  demand of the  Irish people for.tho independence of  Ireland.       Coming  now. to  the use which is  made  by some of  the losdora. of. the Sinn Fein, movement of  direct appeals to physical  force, I find  that all tho active spirits in the; movement  rocort when  :they.have  tho opportunity to some kind. of incitement in  favour of-ultimate armed  action.  To quote a fow.instances of the  kind- of  thing  which has taken  place very; recently:- At Tulla  in County Clare on - June 26th&apos; De Valors, the Sinn Fein candidate (One  of the: released prisoners) .urged  his  opponent to join forces with him to police the. county;  to - &quot;inform  the police  that they were: not required  and  if they  did;not go when  they were asked  to make&apos; them go  with-the hurley&quot; - (meaning the hurley club a somewhat;formidable weapon  easily obtainable as  great numbers of the youths are accustomed to its use  in the national gamo of hurley).   At  Kowmarket.in  the same county  Do Valora advised the people to drill and-am and in answor  to a shout  from the:crowd.&quot;we have arms&quot;  replied &quot;Yes,  and more.  Uo  will- - use them  when the time  comes for Ireland&quot;.-- - At another election  mooting  in the presence of/Messrs. Arthur Griffith, John MacNeill,. .Ginnell, .M..P...,-.,and others,&quot;  Be Yalera proclaimed the policy of .the demand, of absolute  independence for Ireland &quot; at tho Peace  .Conference,, but added &quot;meantime wo  don11 moan to: keep our  fingers. in.our mouths  and stand Idle&quot;,..  and- advised his hearers to&apos; &quot;equip.,;  arm  and  prepare thornsoIvos&quot;He also said -they, would &quot;watch  their opportunity and avail of it when it offered and if anybody, offered them a - helping- hand- whether Prance% America., or Germany  they, would take it&quot;..&apos;   &quot;Be  ready and you will  be more, successful than  last  time&quot;.  At  Killaloe last week Be  Valera preached conditional rebellion-  He said
that &quot;the only caso when he would consider a revolutionjustifiable;would bo;when there would be a good chance ofsuccess&apos;1.  n5&apos;he/Bi itish ;l%ip3 re was at a crisis and it wasnot impossible that daring that crisis a favourableopportunity would arise which would enable the Irish peopleto win their freedom arid secure for Ireland absoluteindependence Jf:    Do Vejora has also made a feature at hiselection meetings of the assembling of young men who hadsome training in military movements before the Rebellionand who march to and from the meeting and draw up beforethe platform in military order;  and under circumstancesof this kind he has advised his audience &quot;to be ready toact when opportunity offered&quot;.      These incendiary speeches of DeValeraTs can be matchedby somewhat similar utterances on the part of some of hismore conspicuous associates,  During the election contestin East Clare I have not deemed it advisable to direct anyaction for the purpose of bringing to account those advocatesof violence.  Other considerations will arise when, as nodoubt will be the case, the same men proceed in the same waywithout the pretext and cover yfoich the election has given.      Concurrently with the establishment of Sinn Fein Clubthere is also a systematic attempt being made to evade theexisting prohibition against drilling, and to roi-establisha- volunteer force throughout the country,    .1 have under consideration the question whether thepowers of the Defeneo of the P.or,Xm Acts and Regulationsought to be used (a) for the purpose of making it generallyknown that the Sinn Pein movement is a revolutionary organ!-sation and as such fit to be suppressed by systematic actionof the police, and (b) &quot;whether there is any reason why assoon as the Clare election is over the powers of the DefenceRegulations should not be used to bring to account theso whohave uttered incitement to sedition and disaffection undorcover of their electioneering proceedings.  These are itseems to me grave questions of policy and I should be gladof guidance in deciding them..             . ---------------...... -........-                           (Initialled)  H.E.D.10th July, 1917.
