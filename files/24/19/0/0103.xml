MILITARY SITUATION AT SALONICA, JULY 1917, BY LIEUT.-COL E.A. PLUNKETT, LIAISON OFFICER BETWEEN THE WAR OFFICE AND SALONICA.

General. 

1. The situation on the Salonica front has not materially altered since my last report at the end of May. The enemy realises that owing to the heat we cannot undertake any operations of importance till October approaches. On both sides there is now only slight local activity.

The French Army Commander, General Grossetti, whose Headquarters are now at Florina, told me that he had on different occasions received information that the Bulgars were preparing to attack the French front, but so far nothing has developed.

This is probably the only point liable to attack, for the line is thinly held from the Cerna westwards, and a determined offensive by the enemy might lead to the recapture of Monastir. Whereas any serious attack on the Vardar-Struma front would lead towards Salonica, and it is unlikely that the German General Staff would employ the Bulgars in an operation which might raise the knotty question of the ultimate disposal of Salonica. This would be too likely to raise difficulties with Austria and Bulgaria.

General Sarrail.

2. The removal of Sarrail is as necessary as before. This lack of confidence of all ranks in their Commander and the failure of the recent offensive has discouraged in a marked degree both officers and men. During my last tour at Salonica I noted a greater tendency to criticise the nature and execution of the recent operations, and the Salonica Army is now a less efficient instrument than it
it was in the spring, of this year .   The replacement ofSarrail by an able Commander should do much to restore thespirit of the army and should provo advantageous in two.ways:-     (a)     (b)The striking power of the army would boincreased, and,if a defensive attitude be decided upon, itshould enable the line to be held by fewertroops, thus rendering possible either thewithdrawal of troops or the despatch offewer reinforcements.Blame forthe un-successfuloffensive&quot;&quot;may beattributedto theSerbians *3.   From various pieces of information supplied me, Igathered that the French will endeavour to saddle theSerbians with the blame for the failure of the offensivein the Spring0     At first sight the case looks bad against the Serbians:their losses were: far less than those of any other army,;they did not attack when the others attacked, and when-they did attack the movement fizzled out almost at once,  v     The real facts of the jiase, however, are as statedin my last report at end of May:-     The Serbian Commanders distrusted the French andwould not commit themselves until they saw that the Frenchmeant business; weather conditions were most unfavourableand fog prevented artillery preparation on the Moglenauntil it was too late to effect anything; when they didattack they found themselves confronted by Bulgarianformations withdrawn from other fronts, which made ituseless to persist in the attack; there was no highercommand to direct the operations of the different armies.Serbian
4,   -SERBIAN AHjgo   I visited the Headquarters of the1st Serbian Army and discussed the situation with theArmy Commande r, Mis It clx.  The men are fit and le s s dis -couraged than was expected by our failure in tho Spring&apos;?In fact all Serbians agree that there will be no difficultyin holding the army together until the Autumn.     The real difficulty however will commence with theWinter-;   A great part of the Serbian line runs over high.mountainsand if they have to continue to hold .the line,the men will again suffer severely throughout the coldweatherV  It may prove difficult then to maintain the moralof the Army unless something can be done to encourage the    The Sub-chief of the Staff advocated : -(a)  The despatch to Salonica, as soon as transport couldbe provided, of further Serbian reinforcements from BizertaYHere are some 10,500 Serbians of fighting age, who are fitand well, and a further 6,000 of fighting age Y/ho are rowcovering from wounds or disease and(b)  The withdrawal of two complete Serbian volunteerdivisions from the Russian front, where thoy now are, and theirdespatch to Salonica,     If the above measures were carried out, the presentSerbian Army of 6 weak divisions could be brought up toStrength (9oOOO infantry per division), and there wouldremain a small surplus as reinforcements,
 Greek    5*   I discussed with General Moinbelli, who recently Troops.         quitted the post of Military Attache at Athens in order         to assume command of the Italian troops at Salonika, the         potential value of the Greek Army under the changed       :  conditions.   General MombeHi, who has several years         experience of Greece and other Balkan countrie s, consider-         ed that the estimate of the Greek General Staff, namely        . that 10 to 15 divisions (150,000 to 200,000 men) would be         available in the near future, was unduly optimistic.   He         based his opinion, in which I concur, on the following     -    grounds: -           (a)  A complete change of policy having recently been         forced -upon Greece, some time must elapse before Greek         troops, which did not join Venizelos, can be relied on         to oppose the Germans and Bulgars.           (b)  Many of the Senior Commanders- and Staff a^. dnotaUxig         most of the Army Headquarters Staff at Athens, have been         strong Royalists since early in the war.   Their remoral.         will create gaps, to fill Which trained personnel is not       \ available.           (c)  The Greek Army has &quot;been expanded sinee the first         Balkan war from 4 to 14 or 15 divi sions and even in -         favourable circumstances has not had time to settle down.              The conditions, however, have been far from favour-         able.   For, as the result of the unsettled political         situation at Athens, the division of the army caused by         the Venezelist movement, and the rough; treatment they         have received at the hands of the Entente, the bulk offt       the men in the Army donH know how they stand or to whom        . they owe allegiance. -This
     .    .    This factor                                      case *f^       fc^juisive and excitable troops like the Greeks who only fight        when inspired by a cauee which appeals to them.  In the present        Case the majority of the Greeks have undoubtedly no real desire        to join,- in the war oh either side.  They realise that it will        take them many years to develop the territory gained by them in        the Balkan wars and they have no wish to gain any more at        present;  in addition many well-to-do &quot;Greeks have made        enormous profits during the war,&apos; and only want to be left in        peace to enjoy the money they have made.        (e jit will probably be necessary to keep a strong bOxly of     &apos;;\ Nationalist troops in Athens to support Veriezeios, and other        bodies In different parts Of Greece to watch events until the        situation clears             Taking into consideratioh the above factors, as well        as the time required for re-equipment of the troops and        the distribution of material collected in the Pelopohnese,        it appears unlikely that more than a slight increase in        the strength of the Greek Army will be possible before        October, and further that it will take till next Spring        to mobilise 10 divisions in a condition fit to operate.             The General Staff at Salonica considers that complete        mobilisation of the Greek Army can at the quickest hot        proceed ai the rate of more than one division a month,        the fourth (Gyclades) division being ready this month.             This estimate gives a tetal of 6 divisions by the end       &apos;, *i September; i,e. 4 divisions available for use at the ...        fr^hti 2 divisions beir%.retained in Athens, &amp;C;   By the        end of tide year; 9 divis ions in ail may be mobilised; ofq*   .&apos;&apos;:.  whom 7 (or perhaps 0) might be available for use at the      &apos;  fronts     y-:^                                               itTry
      It is hardly necessary-to point out that the aboveestimate will probably differ from that of the French, forthe latter, in their anxiety.to justify recent action andto draw attention from their past failures, will be inclinedto exaggerate the military advantages resulting from theremoval of ConstantIns and his party*War Office.
