TheMinister of Defence and ethers are most averse to a separate medalbut are very strongly in favour of Imperial recognition of thename of Gailipoli.   The question should not be indefinitelydelayed as Parliament is sitting.   If anydevelopments take placein to-day1a debate I will telegraph again .  . :  It will be remembered that this question came up at theImperial War Conference and very strong opinlor.3 were expressedby the Now Zealand representatives that &quot;some special medal ordistinction shculd be given to the. men who took part in thatcampaign&quot;.   (Gallipoii - Mr. Massey, 26th March).   &quot;Everybody;who is related to those men will look for some special recog-niticn regarding Gailipoli&quot;.   (Sir J. Ward).   The occasion,they insisted, was historical - the first time that troops fromthe Southern hemisphere had fought in a really great war, and thelosses vrsre very heavy.     The New Zealand representatives, despite the difficultiespointed out to them by Sir N. Macready and the remark      Sir R.For den that the men who had been in France all the time had doneno less, adhered to their position.   &quot;I see&quot;, said Mr. Massey,&quot;some of the difficulties are almost insuperable, but I haveheard nothing to make me believe that it is Impossible,undesir-ables cr improper in any way to provide a special distinctionfor the soldiers who fought at Gallipoli&quot;;  and he feinted cut,no doubt truly, that had Australia been represented the Australianrepresentatives would have expressed the same view.     I trust that everything possible will be done to meet thewishes of New Zealand, and presumably of Australia, In tills matter.Colonial Office.(Intd.)   W.L.     8th July,-191?.
