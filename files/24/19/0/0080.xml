DECRET,JO 3                  Intelligence Bureau,                      Department of Information.                          12th July, 1917.&quot;Summary:of a Memorandum    GERMAN  WAR.  AIMS.:&apos;,\          (The.Memorandum itself,  which amounts to some 30 pages of    foolscap, is &quot;being printed and will be circulated later.  It    deals  in considerable detail  with the points here put forward).1.-       There  are  three possible issues of the war -              (1)   an issue which involves a net loss for the Central      &apos;   ,&apos;; ;//  Powers: /       v&apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;//&apos;:&apos;:-&apos;-&apos;-&apos; .&apos;/&apos;/:-,. ./ -\&apos;.-:...              (2)   a draw: peace on the basis of the status quo                 :;   of July 1914:              (3)   an issue which leaves the Central Powers with                    a net territorial gain.         As/ to  the  first issue, no one in Germany yet publicly    treats it as to be contemplated.2. ...    There  are,  on the other  hand, numbers of people in Germany   &apos;-.&apos;-.&apos;who would welcome a  peace on  the basis of the status quo, a   -&apos;., peace, &quot;without  annexations and without Indemnities&quot;&apos;.  . The    Ha3ority  in the Reichstag /(with the accession of the Centre    Party) now  seems to  be in favour of it.   It is obvious that, ... before accepting loss, Germany is likely to try to get a peace -    on the status quo basis.3.,&apos;./-;     Apart  from the  Social Democrat &quot;Minority&quot;  and a f.-:w    pacifists,  there is  general agreement that the  war must bring  / Germany a gain  (not  necessarily territorial) in some direction. / : . But  there is wide divergence  as to the direction.  All German    programmes  for  future gain, however, are varieties of one or    other  of  five  leading ideas,  or several of these ideas variously
0-3 0    combined.  The five ideas are:         (1)  Sea-Power, Implying annexation of territory in the              West. French and Belgian ports on the North Sea            ...  (at any rate Belgian), the French mining districts              (BrieyJ and Longwy:         (2)  Mltteleuropa, i.e. the constitution of a Central-              European bloc of allied Powers, politically,              militarily and economically associated under              German leadership (In the first instance, Germany,              Austria-Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria)&apos;:         (3)  Berlin-t,o-Baghdad, the control of the Ottoman Empire            ..  (which possibly will eventually recover Egypt):         (4)  Colonies, i.e. an African Empire, reaching across the              Continent from the Indian OOean to the Atlantic:         (5)  New land in the East, i.e. annexation of Russian              territories (Courland, Lithuania) for agricultural             &apos; colonisation by Germans.4,        These five ideas are to some extent rivals:  few people    hold, all five together.  -15-8.       The first of the five ideas is that characteristic of the     circles called distinctively Alldeutsch (Pan-German).  In the     notorious memorandum of the Six Associations  (May, 1915) it was     combined with the fifth idea.  The Pan-German circles coincide     mainly with the Junker agrarian class, Service circles (Army     and Navy) and the owners of the heavy iron works  (the Rnenish-   -  Westphalian industrialists).  The chief enemy for them is     England.  They clamour for the &quot;freedom of the seas&quot; /explaining     that they mean by that the Increase of German Sea-Power     relatively to England1s.  They do not reject  the other of the     five ideas, but they dislike attention being  diverted to them.     For them, if Sea-Power is secured, all other  desirable things      (Colonies, etc.) are included in it;  whereas apart from    &apos;: Sea-Power the realisation of the other five:ideas would be   v;.; comparatively worthless.
12.     The gospel of Kitteleuropa,  cf which Naumann has become the  most popular exponent, aims at creating an aggregate of power, . hy the alliance or federation of  the Central-European States,  capable of meeting the British Empire, Russia and the United  States on equal terms, and also an economic area large enough  to he indefinitely self-supporting - in the event of . a maritime:&apos;, blockade. . The Idea of Mitteleuropa is : habitually couped with  that of Berlin-to-Baghdad, the German control of the Ottoman  Empire, an unbroken stretch.of German power from the North Sea  to the Persian Gulf and the Suez  Canal.   It is claimed that ;(apart from Sea-Power) compulsive pressure could always be  brought to bear upon the British Empire on the Canal and in  Egypt.  Unlike the Pan-German scheme, this scheme could be&apos;:  realised with comparatively little change of the map as it ; was before the war, and it is therefore the favourite scheme with  those who are labelled &quot;Moderate&quot; as against the Pan-Germans. - pCitteleuropa is not, as is commonly said in England, a character-  istic Pan-German idea.    It is the &quot;Moderate&quot; substitute for the  Pan-German scheme.  The Pan-Germans are apt to speak of it as  &quot;a phantom idea&quot; (Reventlow).  If Sea-Power were secured, Mittel-  europa might well be one of the good things it would bring in its  train, but it,ought not to.be made an aim by itself].       According, to the Pan-Germans a status quo peace would be an  utter defeat for Germany and a triumph for England (Reventlow,  passim); according to the exponents of Kitteleuropa plus the  Turkish Empire a status quo peace (although more is to be hoped  for) would be a decisive defeat for England,  because the Turkish  Empire would be left intact and the connection of Germany with- Turkey unbroken (Rohrbach),     ;V;&apos;13..: v -/The: fourth; idea, Colonies.   German colonial ambitions have  now become concentrated upon getting an &quot;African India&quot;,  a con-
tinuous empire right across the African Continent.   It is.urgedthat Colonies are necessary  (1) as increasing Germany&apos;s power/(2) as securing to Germany on favourable terms the  tropicalproducts indispensable for her industries.   As to  the firstconsideration, it is pointed out that if Germany had portson the lest coast of Africa, she could menace Great Britain&apos;ssea-route to the East by way of the Cape.     The fifth idea, annexations in the East, at the expenseof lussia, is represented as an expansion of the German peasantstock upon which the whole fabric of Empire reposes.     These five Ideas are to some extent rivals.  SocialDemocrats of the &quot;Minority&quot; are opposed to all five, but theenthusiasts for one idea are apt to disparage the others;e.g.&quot; Delbrtlck, who is keen for an African Empire, arguesagainst annexations on the West;  the Pan-Germans,  who arekeen for annexations on the West, dislike Haumann&apos;s idea offounding German strength on a group of alliances/ instead ofmaking Germany secure in its own single strength; etc.     The German Government has followed an opportunist policy.The Chancellor has said that Germany must have &quot;guarantees&quot;,but. he has left it obscure whether that means annexations ornot.-. \   &apos;     Since that time, the continued pressure, both military andeconomic, has completely changed the situation.  The questionIs now in fact not - what are the war aims which Germany willimpose before she grants peace, but what terms she herselfwould be willing to accept.   There is no doubt that theGovernment are anxious at the earliest moment to get outof the war on any terms which will secure them against
 revolution at home and national collapse.      The Paris Conference,  followed by the entry of the United States and many of the South American Republics, have put economic matters into the foreground.  The German Government must obviously view with extreme apprehension the situation at home in the months immediately&apos; succeeding the declaration of ,$eace.  The physical exhaustion of the people and of the cotffrtry, combined with the want of food, which cannot be immediately remedied,&apos; and the want of raw material for starting manufactures, will create a most serious situation.  If, when the troops come back from the front, it is not possible immediately to start again the Industrial life of the country &apos;and provider them-with food-and&apos;&quot;work. there  will almost inevitably be a very dangerous revolutionary movement;  this will be started by the Minority Socialists, but If GermanyHjowflrC put of the war without a definite increase of strength and prestige in some form or another, the influence of the J^ernment in the middle classes will he so much weakened that it will be impossible any longer to depend on their active support against a revolutionary movement,  The Prussian military and agrarian party remain as firm and uncompromising, in domestic as in foreign affairs, as they were, and many of them will undoubtedly prefer civil war to any surrender which would deprive them of the political power which they regard as their right.      For this reason that which the-Government probably most regards is security that as soon as the war is ower, there-should be a free flow of food and raw material into the-country, and at the  same time free markets for German produce.  If this could be secured, the energy of the people could be at once directed -to the- restoration^cr&quot; commerce&apos; and Irxiustry-&apos; and their interests so concentrated on; this that tlif^-^wc^iXd. be turned- away
^          :                    6.                              ;  :  from dangerous political considerations.   But in this    connection it has now become apparent that all whicli is included    under the formula Mitteleuropa,  even in its greatest extension/  .  i.e.  commercial control over the South Eastern Europe and    Western Asia, will not be sufficient;  there must be free ami   - favourable commercial intercourse with the rest of the world and    especially the;supply of tropical products in Central Africa,    -    wool and cotton from America and Australia.. 22,      Whilst:the Government itself keeps in the dark background,.:    refusing to forgo its untrammelled opportunism, which will allow    it ultimately to throw itself in the direction of whichever of     he five ideas seems the easiest to realise according to the &apos;;    development of the military aid economic situation, it no doubt    finds &quot;both the Pan-German propaganda and the Scheidemann pro-.    paganda useful in different ways,  The extravagant demands of the    Pan-Germans are useful, in view of future &quot;bargaining;  the higher    that anticipation of what Germany desires is screwed up In enemy    countries, the wider margin will the German Government eventually    have for making proposals which have the air of concessions;    on the other hand, the Scheidemann campaign against annexations    is useful in so far as it conciliates Socialist and Radical    opinion in the enemy countries and enables persons of pacifist    tendencies in those countries to argue for concessions to Germany    on the ground that Germany&apos;s demands are really quite moderate.    There is no reason to think that when the time comes;for the    German Government to formulate its demands, they will be any more    moderate than is necessitated by the pressure of f orgo ma j euro. &apos;
