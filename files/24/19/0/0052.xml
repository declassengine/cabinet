July 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT.OF  THE  COMMITTEE TO  CONSIDER  THE &apos;   SUPPLY  OF  HOME-KILLED  BEEF FOR  ARMY    &quot;PURPOSES;:-;&apos;:.V&quot;&apos;-2.4.0.     ON the 19th March the War Cabinet instructed Mr. Prothero, the Food Controller, General Atkins, and Sir Thomas Robinson to consider what action can be taken with regard to providing a supply of home-killed beef from July onwards for army purposes.     This Committee met on the 25th April, and,  in accordance with their decision, Mr.  Prothero, on the  28th April,  appointed an Executive Committee to report to the above Major  Committee on the following points : -/..-...                                    &apos;:     1.  To submit a scheme for&apos;the purchase of cattle  in the United           Kingdom.        To determine  the  districts  from  which  cattle   may  be           obtained.        To arrange details  of transport  to the places  at which the          ,&apos; cattle will be killed, frozen, or consumed.        To ascertain what conditions and adaptations (if any) are;          - necessary  to render  existing  equipment efficient for           freezing freshly-killed meat.        To consider the probable  effect on  the  markets  of these          * transactions, and to suggest the best means by which   :&apos;/.;/:  meat prices  may be  fixed beforehand so  as to prevent           an excessive rise in price.     The Executive Committee have put forward proposals which may be summarised as follows :  :.     1.  The adaptation of certain selected  cold stores to make them           capable of freezing down fres&apos;dy-killed meat.     2.  The  equipment,  enlargement, and, where necessary, erection     /      of abattoirs to slaughter cattle at thirty selected centres.   -  3.  The  organisation of cattle auctioneers in .Great Britain and         - of cattle salemasters in Ireland to purchase the required           numbers of cattle in each  district.     4.  The fixing of a maximum  price  of cattle  purchased for  the         &apos;; army at the following rates :   -               August      :.  ...  77s. per cwt. live weight.               September .     ...  74s.  ,,,,,,            -   October-December  72s.      ,,                  ; On  the understanding that in any  order published  by  the Food Controller it shall be stated that the  wholesale price of dead meat is to be deemed to be  based on the maximum prices for army cattle,and that if the retail prices of meat be fixed by them, these shall besomewhat lower than the prices that might normally follow from thearmy maximum prices for cattle, so that it shall not be more profitablefor the seller to sell for civilian consumption.    At  a meeting of the  Major  Committee held on the 6th June,at .which  were present  Mr. Prothero, Lord Devonport,  Colonel    [778]
 Tarver (representing  General  Croft on   Atkins),  Mr.  Hall, and Sir Thomas Kobinson, these proposals of the Executive Committee were approved and sanctioned as follows :--          &quot; The  report of. the Executive  Committee was approved,&apos;     provided that when drafting  instructions to buyers it be made   .;  perfectly clear that the maximum.prices fixed will be paid not   -  only for prime and  fat cattle, if taken, but for all animals of a     quality suitable for killing for army purposes.   The provision  &apos;;.-.  as to paying a lesser price for lower  grades  when requisitioned     will  become operative if  and  when the  army may have to-     .purehase and kill animals of inferior grades.  The  instructions     to buyers  were  to  be submitted in  draft  to  the Board for&apos;..&apos;.--&apos;.-. approval.  -/ :  &apos;-&apos;.-&apos;-&apos;.- -&apos;-&quot;&apos;-&apos;-&apos;&apos;*&apos;;.&apos;-&apos;.&apos;-&apos; -.-&apos;-&quot;.-V&apos;.. &apos;./-&apos;R/-\\        &apos;/: V      ; ;.-       &quot;The&apos;Major  Committee  authorise the  Executive  Cum-     mittee  to  take  whatever action  regarding  alterations   to     refrigerating and cold-storage equipment they consider necessary     and desirable, having regard to the sum placed at our  disposal.     Ihey consider that the local  authorities should  be invited to     bear some portion of the necessary expense where the work done  &apos;; . will  be of permanent  value;  and  that in  cases where local     authorities refuse to make a fair contribution, it should be made    . clear that  the additions to plant and equipment  will remain     the property of  the   Government,-  and-will be subsequently     removed.                  1              &apos;         &quot;The  Major Committee  accepted-the  proposal that  the.     Board of Agriculture should become the accounting; department,  ...  and should repay to the auctioneers  the sums paid by them in     cash  to the farmers  on the purchase of the cattle.&quot;     The  Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board  of  Agri- culture for Scotland, and the  Department  of  Agriculture  and Technical Instruction  for Ireland agreed to the above prices on  the understanding  that they  should  be announced  six weeks  or, if-possible, two months before coming, into operation.  A press notice bearing oh  this point was issued  by the Ministry of Food on the 7th  June as follows :            The  Ministry - of Food forwards the following notice for    &apos; publication : With  a  view of removing the apprehensions of   ;:. farmers,  dealers,  and  others  concerned in  bringing  forward   .&apos;-  supplies to  the various  cattle and meat markets, it is announced... - that no  order fixing  maximum prices will become  operative     without reasonable notice.&quot;               -.  :    ;  .  .   &apos;  The work on the adaptation of cold stores and on the abattoirs is in hand;  the ceutral offices  and  details  of administration have been arranged;  and the English and Scottish auctioneers, together with the Irish salesmasters, have organised themselves for the  pur- chase of the cattle in  conjunction  with the War  Office  and  the executive officers appointed by the  Committee.           :     So far as the instruction of the Cabinet and the work  of the original Committee are concerned, the organisation is  complete and only awaits the confirmation or alteration by  the  present  Food Controller of the proposed prices on which the arrangement has been based.         -               -                    .:  -   .
