S EEC RET.G/f. 1368.WAR CABINET.From :  Brigadier-General Xnox,Petrograd.To338th July,  1917.1229.     , With the hope no doubt of influencing people  againstthe offensive,  the Bolsheviki and German party are  doing  allin their power to ossuse trouble.   In addition  to  cases mentionedin previous telegrams, they caused a row in the 1st depotRegiment here.   Kronstadt has also broken out  into  unrestagain, the pretext being the arrest of anarchists referredto in a telegram.  The Government Commission sitting there  toinvestigate the cases of men under arrest in Kronstadt has  hadto leave hurriedly.  The Minister of Agriculture  speakingbefore the All-Russia Conference  yesterday gave a verygloomy picture of this yearns harvests prospect,  which heclassified as being below the average.  In view of  bad harvestsome districts refuse to co-operate in the plan worked out  byhim and will not consent to supplying other districts of  Russia.The plan will be a failure if this policy is persisted in,and the look out for next winter  will be worse than it is atpresent.  In addition, it is certain there will be  a greatshortness of fuel and little is being prepared and  inability(to satisfy?) the Finns is getting very serious.  They evidentlywish to get rid of all Russian soldiers and sailors,  and  thisquestion is going to affect seriously the question  of thedefence of the Gulf of Finland *
