TEH12ELOS to MR. .7. J. STAVRIBI.                                                    ATHENS.                                              12th July, 1917.     Replying to? your telegram of the  2nd June.  In view of thenumber of rifles and moiintain and light artillery which Greececan dispose of we can. if in th6 meantime we are supplied withthe clothing, uniforms, equipment, heavy artillery and otherwar material, of which a detailed list will he submittedshortly, order in three months a mobilisation which Will allowus to place on the Macedonian Front 12 divisions, comprising thetwo divisions of the National Defence whioh are^eady on thatfront, that is in all 106,000 bayonets, or, taking thedivisions at their full strength, 183,000 men without countingthe auxiliary services (services de lfarrlere).  Later on,that is to say six months after, I hope it will be possibleto form another three divisions for which however we lack,over and above the material already mentioned, both riflesand artillery.  As regards the expenses of the war;  Greece,who has already had to bear the burden of two Balkan T/ars,and a ten months mobilisation in 1915 and the consequence ofthe insensate policy of the King1and a very long blockade,is not in a position to undertake alone the whole of theMilitary expenditure.  It is however only right that, nowthat Greece has achieve! her unification, she should take aportion of the expenditure on herself.  The expenses sheoan for the present assume are the following:-,1.     Pay and allowance for the. Officers.  Pay for the           Soldiers.            *2.     Allocations to the families of the Reservists.3*     Requisition of animals and other means of transport           made ifa the Country.4.     Payments for transport by land and sea.5.     Labour of the Country for all work (making of           roads etc)..6.     Naval expenses.     To what extent Greeoe will have to take her share ofthe other important expenses of the Army will be determined .by the protecting Powers at the end of the *.ar according tothe duration of the Ivar, the advantages whioh Greeoe mayacquire eventually under the Treaty of Peace and her economi-oal position after the declaration of peace.  It is under--stood that, even in regard to the expenses which the GreekGovernment takes upon itself,  the protecting Powers will haveto grant her their assistanco with a view to raising a foreignloan in order to meet the same.  MHreover the Greek Govern-ment intends to apply to the United States of America Inorder to obtain a loan of 100.000,000 francs which is necessary
to cover the actual deficit on her ordinary budget.  TheGovernment believes that it may rely for this purpose on themoral assistance of the protecting Powers.  As regards theutilisation of the Greek Army I think that ft could fight withmore efficiency on the Struma front/where, owing to itsmobility and its adaptability of mountain fighting, it couldthreaten the Bulgarian capital;  but this will be decided bythe respective General Staffs.VENIZELOS.No. 1364.          In preparing to participate in the far with allit1s forces by the side of the Entente,  the Royal governmentconsiders it;it1s duty not to formulate  any claim as to theeventual compensations to be obtained.          Entering into the War1 with the resolve to contri-bute towards it all her material and moral forces, Greece isactuated especially by the consciousness of a double duty -her Treaty obligations towards Serbia, and her debt ofgratitude towards the protecting Powers. .          The Royal Government wishes to avoid formulatingconditionst all the more as it is aware  that euch a.coursewould create difficulties irt .the relations of the ProtectingPowers with one of the Allied Powers.          Moreover it finds a sufficient guarantee for itsethnic rights and it1s vital interests,  both in thedefinition of the objects of the War as  given by the Ententeand in the solicitude and the real sympathy the ProtectingPowers haVe never ceased to testify towards Greece - a solici-tude and sjtoipathy of which, dhe is persuaded, a fresh testi^mony will be furnished to her at the moment when the War isfinally disposed of.
