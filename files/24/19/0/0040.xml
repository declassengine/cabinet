WEEKLY -REPORT ON RUSSIA.-  XII.                       (July 9/ 1917).The Meaning of the Offensive.     Now that the offensive has been launched, whatever its successmay be, it is worth while speculating on the intentions of thoseSocialist Ministers who  have given it their unstinted support.The chief credit for the offensive lies with Hr Kerenski who hasinspired the whole movement and has carried with him a large majorityin the C.W.S.D.  The opposition that he has had to overcome has beeninfluenced by tv/o considerations.  On the one hand there are theMaximalists and Anarchists who oppose an offensive for -politicalr e a s on s, at s they see in it the end of their own influence, on theother lihere is a considerable group of Minimalists and SocialRevolutionaries, who politically are in agreement with Kerenski andTsere+elll, but have opposed an offensive from, distrust of theirown power to carry.it through.  There is little doubt that thepacifism of this group is mainly based on the feeling of discourage -ment which is the result of previous failures and mismanagement andthe present disorganisation of the rear.  It is this discouragementwhich Kerenski has worked day and night to overcome.  He realisesthe futility cf diplomatic negotiations with the Allies until he hasgiven evidence that Russia is still a military power, able andwilling to fight for its ideas.     A, study of Mr Kerenski&apos;s speeches seems.to prove that hehas in no way deviated from his original views about the war andthe peace that must follow it.  In urging an offensive he does so-in the name of the formula of the Government:-  &quot;Peace withoutannexations, cr indemnities but with the right of nations todetermine their own fate;i.  His opponents to. the Left have. &apos;
interpreted this formula in their own way, viz. they haveaccepted the first- part &quot;peace without annexations or indemnities&quot;and have ignored the second part.  This is also the line that hasbeen taken by German propaganda in Russia.  The object  of thoseSocialists who support the offensive is to give the peace formulaits full interpretation, and to meet the Allies at the  coming con-ference about war aims with the enhanced prestige that  the offensivewill give them.     What cannot be lost sight of are the dangers that  Kerenskihimself may be exposed to in the near future.  It has been difficultfor his enemies to attack him owing to his strong idealism andhonesty of purpose and his extraordinary popuf- arity, but thebeginning of the offensive  ill make his enemies more desperatein their efforts to discredit him.  Any tendency in the Britishpress to praise Kerenski while saying strong things against RussianSocialists in general will do harm, as Kerenski owes his positionto the fact that he has rightly interpreted the ideas of hisfellow-countrymen.  Kerenski cannot be dissociated from his fellow-countrymen any more than Venizelos from his.     It is essential for Kerenski to be able to furnish proof tothe C.W.S.D. that the Russian offensive is going to have an effecton the reception of Russia&apos;s war aims by the Allies.  Otherwisehis opponents will renew the campaign against him on the groundthat he is waging an imperialist war in league with &quot;British andPreneh Imperialists&quot;.  It is probable, therefore, that, should theoffensive prove successful,  the Russian Government will takeadvantage of the strengthening of public opinion to push home onthe Allies its claims for a revision of war aims.The Caucasus.     In view of the strong separatist tendencies in Finland and theUkraine it is reassuring to notice that the Revolution has passed
  off much more quietly in the Caucasus.  This is no doubt due in  large measure to the distance from the chief revolutionary centres.  According to recent information from Tiflis the original Duma  -  representatives,, rdio were sent to the Caucasus at the beginning  of the Revolution,  are still exercising authority.  Councils of  Workmen1s and SoldiersT  Delegates have been formed under the leader-  ship of Chkhenkeli, a Georgian Socialist who was closely associated  with Chkhei&amp;ze in the Duma, but the Socialist movement has not made  great headway.  Moreover, there is not the same close contact  between the Soldiers and Workmen in the Caucasus as in other parts - of Russia.            &apos; &apos;     .  (a) The Armenians.           , * 1,11 1  1 -IG  &quot; 1  1 &apos; ,.                 The Armenians as a whole have adopted a very cautious  attitude since the Revolution, although a few- hot-headed groups  have indulged In violent Socialist propaganda.  The main idea of  the Armenians is to consolidate the new regime.  Arrangements are  now being made for a Pan-Armenian Conference to determine: - .  (1) The. attitude of the  Armenians towards the. Constituent Assembly.  (2) The position of Armenians in the Caucasus.  (3) The future of  Armenia both in the Caucasus  and Turkish Armenia.      . (b) The Georgians.  -               .                 The Revolution has given a fresh impetus to the  Georgian national movement.&apos;  The first sign of this movement was the  declaration of spiritual independence, the Russian Exarch being  replaced by a Georgian Catholicos quite independent of the Holy  Synod at Petrograd.,        /  ,  ;:     Relations between Georgians and Armenians have0 improved since the Revolution, thanks to the removal of the Russian  chinovniks and the Grand puke Nicholas, who continued the policy  of setting one nationality against another in the Caucasus,  The  only classes which still hold aloof from the Revolution are the
                                      \                            4.Georgian aristocracy,  who in former times relied on the support                     Jof the Russian Government,  and  the rich  Armenian bourgeoisie.     (c) The Tatars.               Since  the Revolution the  movement among the Tatarshas been social and religious rather than political.  They arenot so well organised as the Georgians and Armenians and do notpossess national Institutions.   The main questions now beingdiscussed are the raising of the status  of their women and theremoval of the differences  between the Shia and Sunni sects.A Panislamic Conference is  to be held later on in Petrograd todiscuss what demands  are to be  made by the Tatars to theConstituent Assembly.
