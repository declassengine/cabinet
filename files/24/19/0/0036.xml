The question of  the  transfer of men from coal ,&quot;\      mines to meet  the demand of  Ministry  of Munitions for anpis  .   increased output  of iron ore has again been under considera-      tion.    The Ministry are now considering a supply of Irish      labour, and proposals  to transfer coal miners are&apos; in abeyance.
     Arrangements for the transfer  of coal miners  to  shalemines are proceeding, but the Ministry of Munitions havenot yet completed their plans.. .                    *AGRICULTURAL SECTION. (a)  Military and other labour on  the farms. :     1.   England and Wales.   The  Commissioners and  Sub-Commissioners continue to be engaged in distributing  the lentMilitary labour.   The Pood Production Department  have had toyery their allocation of the lent soldier labour throughout theCountry, the demands in certain districts being larger than an-ticipated, and in others less.   Up to-now, however,  the Directorhas been able to adjust these variations with the  MilitaryAuthorities, and. in one or two instances to arrange for therelease of the men, promised for the Corn Harvest,  to  come intoeffect for the Hay Harvest.     2*   Scotland,    A first instalment of 600 men for theHay Harvest were released on Monday 2nd July, and  have beendistributed to the various centres  requiring them.(b)  National Service Volunteers.     England and Wales.    Considerable difficulty  has beenexperienced in getting Agricultural Executive Committeesthroughout the Country to undertake the payment of subsis-tence allowances to National Service Volunteers as providedfor in the agreement between the Director-General  and thePresident of the Board of Agriculture,  which provision thePood Production Department insisted upon at the time theagreement was made.   . The Director of the Agricultural Sec-tion, however, now has an assurance from the Pood ProductionDepartment that an urgent circular has  been issued to thoseCommittees insisting that payment  of these subsistence allow-ances shall be attended  to at  once.(c)  Part-Time Labour.:     1.    Hay Harvest.    The Director is  preparing  a  separate
report on this matter out at present the Commissioners and ,Sub-Commissioners have been so fully occupied that it has notbeen found possible to get it completed during the course ofthe week. -                 ::.   2.   Timber Workers.    The National Service Volunteers forTimber work continue to be placed through the Timber SupplyDepartment.                              ;&apos;   3.   School Boy Labour.   A special report is being preparedwhich it is hoped will be sent with next week&apos;s report.GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a)  Trade Committees.   Since the previous report informationas to the setting up of the following local Trade Committees hasbeen received&apos;-             4 in the English Building Trade             2 in the Scottish Building Trade             4 in the Furnishing Trade             1 in the Printing Trade.     The aggregate number of Joint Local Committees is now, sofar as known,           (64 In the English Building Trade           ( 2 in the Scottish Building Trade      132  (10 In the Furnishing Trade           (41 in the Printing Trade           (15 in the Paper Trade.     In the Entertainments, Wrought Iron Hollow-Ware, LightCastings, and Lock and Latch industries there are no Local Com-mittees, the whole work being done by the Central Committees.     So far as known, with negligible exceptions, none of theseCommittees have been asked by Substitution Officers to supplymen.   The explanation of this is probably to be found in theabsence of demands mentioned in the part of this report dealingwith Substitution.     .Returns have been asked for showing the number of Volun-teers who have signed the form stating that they are willingto serve but up to date only a few returns have cometto hand.
     During the week an important conference has been held withthe representatives&apos;.of *f our of the largest Trade Unions representing -general labourers.    The new scheme was well received and those present promised to bring it before the Federation of GeneralLabour Unions,  representing half a million men, at a meeting tobe&quot;held on 17th July.    If, as seems likely, this Federationmeeting endorses the scheme their approval will have an import-ant effect.     The ground as regards the Heavy Castings Trade has now beencleared and a. Conference is being arranged.    This will have theeffect of allowing the Light Castings Trade to.issue their appeal,which, as previously stated, was deferred until the Heavy CastingsTrade should come into line.     In the internal substitution scheme in operation in thePottery Trades, over and above the 1,254 men released for the Armydirect, arrangements have been made for the release of 314 forsubstitution purposes.NATIONAL SERVICE COIflv-ITTEES.     The number of National Service Committees appointed to datein England and -ales is 863 out of a possible total number of 1,080,and in Scotland 139 out of a total of 236.     These Committees  are in the majority of cases ready for activeoperations immediately they are called upon.SUBSTITUTION SECTION.  ...     Returns of men dealt with by Substitution Officers in the weekending Saturday last are as follows                    2,146 demanded,                    1,620 submitted to employers.                      624 placed.     The A.5.0*8 and Commissioners report that progress is slowowing to absence of demands.   The lack of co-operation on the part         Eof the A.$,0&apos;S  mentioned in last week&apos;s report makes it almost im-possible for A.S.0&apos;s to progress at all in the placing, of N.S.V&apos;s.
-5-241     The reports regarding the National Service Committeessuggest that they are rather marking time..  -. They need thestimulus that would follow were it.possible&apos; to put morespecific demands before them.     As showing how little has been done as yet to &quot;camb out&quot;the Munitions Factories, Colonel Courtenay, in reporting on hisvisit to the Bradford Office, saysr-     &quot;The first quota to be supplied to the Army from this     area up to the present day was 1,090,   Of these only     170 have been called up.   The K.A.R.0, considers that     there have not till lately been sufficient dilution     Officers to carry out the work and that two more would     be useful.&quot;He further reports that in the opinion of the Officers of thei.A.R.0. in this area the fundamental block to getting men forthe Army is to be found in the Ministry of Munitions&apos; Inatrue-tions to Dilution Officers.WOMEN&apos;S SECTION.W.A.A.Corps.   Following the meeting under the Chairmanship ofLord Derby reported last week, the difficulties which havearisen over the Provincial Recruiting organisation and theSelection Boards were discussed this week at a meeting ofWomen Commissioners.    Some delay in calling up those who hadalready been before the Selection Boards has been occasionedby the lack of co-ordination on the part of the War Office, re-sulting in some cases in a definite loss of employment.WOMEN1S LAND ARMY. - BNROI&amp;EKTS.                  England    ......     34,427                  Scotland   ......      2,994                  Ireland                  35                                       37,456.     Circular letters urging an aetive campaign for recruitsboth .fer the Women&apos;s Army.Auxiliary Corps and the Women*s LandArmy hava been issued to the National Service Committees  in theprincipal Health and pleasure Resorts of the country, to  thenumber of 83, requesting them to submit schemes for approval.In addition, circular letters have been issued to the Secretariesof 194 National Service Committees,  requesting them to undertake
 an active campaign on behalf of the Women1s- Land&apos;Army.     It has been suggested that a scheme for the short time enrolment of Women Land Workers could be worked through the existing machinery of the Land Army, and plans are being worked out in conju notion with the Agricultural Section.     Timber Felling.     Training in this work has started at Newstead and-Barnham and arrangements are in process for the formation of a Women&apos;s Forestry Legion.     Hay Baling.     Difficulties having arisen with the Employment Department who refused to co-operate in obtaining the necessary labour for this work through Selection Committees,, on which the Forage De- partment of the !7ar Office insisted the question of machinery for this purpose has become an urgent one.     It has been recommended to the Board of Agriculture that candidates for this work should be dealt with by the Selection and Allocation Committees of that Board so that candidates refused for the Land Army would have a possibility of alternative employment     WASTE COLLECTION.     An exhibit, has been organised at the County Hall where thevarious stages of manufacture of cloth from rags, and of cartridge cases from paper are shewn.    Help is eagerly offered for this collection and it is hoped that in view of representations to theRoyal Commission on Paper,  the  scheme will be able to develop considerably in localities  where help is offered.July 6th 1917.(S igned)   NEVILLE C RAUBERLAIN.
