SECRET.Intelligence; /Bureau.Department of Information.WEEKLY  REPORT  OH  SPUR/  VI.PSW/VI.     The only event of the week in Spain h s been in a meeting ofsome 59 Senators and Deputies held at Barcelona.    This gathering,which had.the support of Senor Lerroux,  the Republican leader, butwas not confined to Republicans,  passed a resolution calling for apolicy of Regionalism&apos;,  that is  a reorganisation of the country on abasis of local autonomy,  and in particular demanding &quot;home rule&quot;for Catalonia.   The meeting also insisted on an immediate summoningof the Cortes and decided,  if the Government refused,  to invite bothHouses of Parliament to meet at Barcelona on the 19th.     Thest resolutions are said to have been supported not only byRepublican Regionalists and Cortists but even by some of the Liberalsv/ho follow the Marquis of Alhucemas.   Such followers of Senor Dato.and of Count Romwaones who were present withdrew from the meeting.This is another challenge to the  Government and they have at oncetaken it up, declining to tolerate the assumption by any one but theKing of the right to fix a date for the meeting of the Cortes and poining out that any such meeting as  that proposed for July 19th is con-trary to the Penal Code.    They &quot;trust therefore that its organiser^will refrain out of patriotism from summoning it.&quot;   But if not theGovernment will &quot;do its duty with absolute firmness&quot;     It remains to be seen whether this noliteness is the prudenceof weakness ofc that of strength.    There, is no doubt that Senor Datoand his Cabinet are likely to need all the wisdom and courage whichtheir best friends can suTvoose them to possess and much more them  itiZv^critics give them credit for.  Ho news has Come  through of actualdisturbance on any serious scale  but that may be due,  as a PrencC pape
 says, to tho same causes as those which have led to the  Spanish papers being chiefly full of weddings and funerals.   Still no; censor can long prevent really grave events leaking out,   It is not so much what people in Spain are doing as what they are  thinking and saying that causes anxiety.   Every foreigner who comes  away reports that the complaints against the existing political system continue, increase, and come from all schools of thought.   Lerroux open&amp;y boasts that while the Liberals are snlit in two, his own Republican party is united, has new with it the Socialists and Reformists and is preparing for a political revolution.   The attacks on tho King are frequent and almost unveiled;   one Liberal paper has been publishing a scries of articles on abdications with caricatures of  the flight of the ICing13 grandmother, Queen Isabella;  and the King, who is known to have seen the veteran Reformist Azcarrete, his go-betv/een when he rallied the Reformists to the Throne, is not likely to have talked of nothing but social reform, the ostensible object of the  interview, and is reported to have heard some very unnleasant nlain speaking as to his own position.     Lid he lose his chance when he failed to make use of the bridge that that was built for him four years ago by the adhesion of tho Reformists to the Monarchy?   Could he then have escaped from the narrow atmosphere of the little official ring of politicians and identified himself with something more nearly resembling the nation as a whole?  Is it too &amp;ate now,  as the Reformists seem to tell him by their return to the Republican fold?   He is trying to conciliate the Army,  and with that object has dismissed the unpopular chiefs of his Military Cabinet. For the moment the Army crisis seems to be over,  though truculant officers have written to the papers to say it isnot peace but a truce. But the Array business was at least as much a symptom as  a causs.    The
  cause lies deeper, in the general dissatisfaction and unrest of. the  whole nation.   It is worth noticing that fount Romenones, a loyal  supporter of the Monarchy, who has just said publicly that the  Monarchist party is the strongest in Spain, should&apos; also  point out  in the letter he has sent %tothe press about the formation of his new&quot;  party, that Spain has now the spectacle of a Monarchist party demanding  a reform of the Constitution.   This is the problem the King has to    .  face in the near future. ; Has he himself, have the statesmen who  surround him, the courage or ability needed for its solution?   If not,  then sooner or later, more probably later than sooner, other people willI  find a solution wise or foolish, and the Monarchy will be at an end.  Meanwhile the political ignorance and apathy of the vast majority of ,-&apos;.&apos;&apos;I  Spaniards, the at least temporary solution of the army difficulty,I  the violence of the Extremists,  both of the Right and the Left, who -eon*-  traaiot each other, make it likely that, the King will have time to  look round and time to apply his own remedy, if he can find one.      The formation of a regular party of Liberals following Count  Romanones, to which allusion has just been made, will be welcomed with  Satisfaction in England.   Tho meeting which formed it consisted of  over 100 Senators and Deputies,  and passed resolutions calling for:  Constitutional revision, and some sort of regional autonomy;   and,:  what is of greater interest to us,  emphatically affirmed its adherence  to the international policy of Count Romanones.    This mean  of oourse  the pro-Ally policy on which he fell, to which,  as he says in an  interview, he deliberately and knowingly sacrificed himself.    But it  does not mean intervention:  so he adds with groat emphasis in the same   nterview.   The truth is that with Spain as it is and with such an Army  as it has, no one in Spain, except indeed Senor Lerroux,  seriously ad-  vooates an actual entry into the v/ar.   But there are ways short of
                         ( A  )     in which our friends *can be-useful to us:  and among thosefriends will be the new Liberal party under the leadership of CountRomanones. :                                                   -J.C. 3.
