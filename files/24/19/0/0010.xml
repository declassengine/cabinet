SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION

June 29 - July 5. 1917.

?. DENMARK

The Danish farmers and bacon exporters have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the result of the London conferences so far as the Agricultural Agreement is concerned. They decline to continue exporting bacon to this country at the unremunerative prices which are now prevailing. It seems, however, that Danish bacon would command higher prices in the United Kingdom if it were despatched in better condition and is more carefully handled on arrival. H.M. Government have appointed a special Commissioner to supervise the storage of Danish bacon.

The Germans recently demanded one half of the export able surplus of Danish produce. But a Danish banker states that the German Reichsbank is at a loss how to finance further purchase from Denmark. The German Government at the end of June remitted twenty million marks in gold to Copenhagen, with the result that the exchange on Berlin advanced by one krone. But the Reichsbank deprecates further exports of gold. It would appear that Germany must diminish her purchases of Danish cattle and produce, and in consequence will be obliged to kill off her own cattle.

The Danish Shipowners accept the draft shipping Agreement which we mentioned last week. But Captain Cold has unofficially warned us that the Agreement will probably be cancelled if all imports from the United States are cut off.

The Danish Government promise that, if we will allow the importation of Mineral Oils to be resumed, the Danish
exports of fish to Germany shall not exceed 2,100 tons per month. We have accepted this arrangement with the provision that fishermen who export to Germany shall not be allowed to receive supplies imported from the United Kingdom.

S2. SWEDEN.

The Swedish cotton and jute factories will be compelled to close, for want of raw materials, at the end of July. Other industries are in a critical position, and the Unemployment Commission recommends that factory labour should be diverted to the land during the summer months so that a part of the raw materials still available may be reserved until the winter.

In the period June 1 - June 27 the number of Swedish vessels which cleared from Swedish ports for the United Kingdom was 26, whereas before the war the average monthly sailings were 130. As the round voyage at present takes double the ordinary time, the position is more favourable to us than the figures alone would indicate; moreover the June sailings show a marked improvement on those of May (14) and April (10). But the Swedes have as yet hardly established a claim to special facilities for their imports. Admiral Lindman is considering our offer to accelerate the release of grain ships in exchange for free transit to Russia. But, even if he solves the food problem in this way, he will shortly be compelled to make further concessions, if we insist upon them, as the price of facilities for fertilisers, which are almost as urgently required as grain.

 
? NORWAY.

Since the United States have not yet decided on their measures for restricting Norwegian exports to Germany, we are opening negotiations for the output of molybdenite from three Norwegian mines - Kvina, Dalen and Gursli.

The Norwegian Prime Minister still appears to hope that he may, under the new Shipping Agreement, succeed in transferring the control over British coal imports from H.M.Legation to the Ministry of Supplies. But any move in this direction will be resisted; our coal control is still our chief guarantee for the good behaviour of Norwegian firms.

? NETHERLANDS.

The Dutch Government have taken no adequate steps to supply us with the 12,000 tons of old potatoes which are still due to us. Pending the liquidation of this deficit they are bound, by the Agricultural Agreement, to suspend all exports of potatoes to Germany. But export licences have been granted in favour of Germany during the past few days; and it would appear that the Government are deliberately trying to throw upon us the odium for the present shortage of potatoes in Holland, though in truth they are under no obligation to supply us so long as they abstain from supplying Germany.

The news that as from July 4, our minefields in the North Sea will be considerably extended has aroused considerable indignation in the Netherlands. M. Loudon complains that we have closed the only safe channel which remained open for Dutch trade with overseas countries. The President of the N.O.T. threatens to resign, as the stoppage of Dutch navigation has made the Trust a laughing stock.
