          Evidence of war-weariness and desire for a  separatepeace in Austria-Hungary.            In  examining  the  &quot;moral&quot;  of any belligerent it is &quot;                                                                  j&apos;  necessary to  distinguish between the army in the field and the  rest  of  the  nation,  including  the  troops in depots  and  garrisons  in  homo, territory,,             An  appreciation  cf the &quot;moral&quot; of the  Austro-          i  Hungarian forces  in  the field  must be based on            (a)   the behaviour of the troops in action;             &apos;            (b)   the examination  of prisoners;            (c)   captured documents.  It must  be admitted  that the behaviour of Austro-Hungarian       j  troops in action,  which is by  far  the most important criterion^.   I]  shows little  evidence  of less  of &quot;moral&quot;.   In the  recent                                                    :     ; ; ------      -  fighting on  the  Isonzo and in  the  Trentino they  fought as well   jt  as at any previous period  of the war.     The examination of the jj  prisoners taken  in the recent  fighting on the Isonzo showed that,1;  although the  standard  varied greatly in different units,  the&quot;general  average  of &quot;both-physique&apos;and &quot;moral&quot; was good.   Units  formed of men of  mixed nationalities were found  to  be lacking in j  esprit de corps  and  to be  poorly fed and equipped.     Prisoners   ,  belonging to  Magyar  units, on  the  other hand,  were  well fed,  well;  clothed  and  well  equipped  and  made an excellent  impression.             Although it  is impossible at present to form an  opinion  of the fighting qualities  shown by the Austro-Hungarian                  .     .            . ,; -.--           .                - I  troops in the recent battles in Galicia,  there is evidence that  &apos;                   &apos;  *  -                                      .    ii!  the Slav units showed  their old weakness in  face of the  Bussians.    There is net sufficient evidence,  ho\Tever,  to state  that  the &quot;moralv of the Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern                .                                       Theatre.      i
Theatre has deteriorated since 1916.   It is true that thenumbers of deserters have increased during the last few months,and that these deserters have reported a certain lack ofdiscipline in their units,  but thin is probably due to the openfraternization that was encouraged until recently between theopp0sing armies.          There is, however, a considerable amount of evidenceof loss of &quot;moral&quot; in captured  letters on both fronts, but. itmust be remembered that similar letters have been found onGerman prisoners since the first battle of Ypres in 1914.   Theworst type of soldier in every army will always write  despair-ingly of his hardships  and it would be unsound to infer ageneral lowering of &quot;moral&quot; from such complaints and pretests,.As far as the -Austro-Hungarian army in the field is concerned,therefore, while there are undoubtedly discontented elementsamong the various nationalities represented in the army and aspirit of war-weariness prevails among individuals,  there is as                &apos;&quot;\S-              &apos;.:    y-                  &apos; Iyet no -evidence of such a spirit developing into organisedrevolt, nor are there indications of a marked or wide-spreaddeterioration in the &quot;moral&quot;&apos; of the troops,..          The sources of information concerning the&quot;mor&amp;*&quot; ofthe people are          (a)  captured documents.;.          (b)  reports of neutral travellers;          (c)  reports of agents;          (d)  the enemy press;.   .          (e).  indirect evidence from political changes          Evidence of War-weariness is to be found in manycaptured and intercepted documents..          The discussion of peace prospects was very prevalent                                                       during
during the months of February and March of this year, when therigours of a severe &quot;winter were, beginning to tell on thepopulation^          Shortage of food, milk-, coal and other necessitieshas been the cause of numerous complaints from the inhabitantsof both town and country in their letters to relatives  inthe field and in America, and many a letter has beenintercepted ending with some such phrase as &quot;$hen will.-thisslaughter cease?&quot;;  &quot;Surely this state of things cannot go onlonger&quot;.          It must be noted,, however, that similar expressionsof complaint and despair are found in letters on Germanprisoners, and, according to the enemy wireless news, on Alliedprisoners as well,.          The desire for an.early peace is, in fact, generalin every belligerent country,. and it would not be wise  toassume from captured correspondence that it is much greaterin Austria-Hungary than in any other country.          The reports of neutral.travellers, however, indicatethat the feeling of war-weariness is more pronounced in Austria^Hungary than in Germany.  In a letter from Berne dated  the 19thApril, the writer says: &quot;I hear that in Austria everybody wantspeace; they are heartily sick of the war&quot;. The writer was one whohad been in touch with various American consuls who hadlately left Austria, and appeared to be in a position to gainreliable information of internal conditions.  The reportsof agents tend; to confirm the impression.of general war-weariness .   During the.month of.June alone, reports havebeen recoived of explosions, at the Skoda works at Pilsen, atthe dynamite factory at Pressburg, at an ammunition factoryin Budapest, at Steinfeld in Karinthia and at Bloeweg,  and                                                       a
a strike has been reported at the Skoda works.  The explosionat Pilsen has been reported in the Austrian Press.          The most important evidence of the feeling ofunrest in Austria-Hungary, however, is afforded by the. actionof the young-Emperor in summoning the Reichsrat and in grantingan amnesty to the Czech political prisoners.  Both these actshave been bitterly denounced not only by the ConservativePress in Germany, but also by the Germans in Austria,  Theyare signs that the Emperor sees the neoessity of attemptingto.pull the Dual Monarchy together by making concessions, tothe various nationalities.  It should also be noted that it isonly within the last few months that the discussion of war-aimshas been permitted in the Austro-Hungarian Press.          It is significant, too, that the officiallyinspired Press (notably the &quot;Premdenblatt&quot; at the beginning ofJune) have published several articles advocating peaceproposals on the basis of &quot;no annexations, no indemnities&quot;, andhave continued to publish them in spite of violent protestson the part of the Conservative Press in Germany.          Speeches have been made, even by Germans in theReichsrat, giving expression to a desire for peace,  Porexample on the I5th June, Seitz (a German Social Democrat)even went so far as to utter the following words in theReichsrat    &quot;The first question to be raised by a SocialDemocrat in the House must be that of peace.   All the worldmust be told that the masses in Austria yearn for peace&quot;.It is noteworthy that such an utterance should have beenmade by a German and allowed to pass the censor..  On the 15thJune, Wolf (of the Deutscher Uational-Verband) stated that&quot;no one more longed for peace than the Germans in Austria,but only for a peace which would be lasting and would securetheir future,&quot;          There is ample evidence, therefore, that the feeling                                                     of
of war-weariness in Austria-Hungary lias reached a point atwhich the Government is forced to attempt to counteract itby conciliating the various nationalities and by convincingthe people as a whole that, as far as the Government isconcerned, there is no obstacle to an honourable peacec.          Although there are many indications that Austria-Hungary is anxious for peace, and that&apos; certain sections of thepeople are possibly willing to accept any terms, there are nosigns that the people as a whole is ready to acoept the termsas defined in the Entente reply to President Wilson inJanuary, 1917.  Hor are there any indications that Austria-Hungary is anxious to conclude a separate peace except withRussia.  There is little doubt that the German Government.has supported Austria-Hungary&apos;n proposal to/attempt a separatepeace v/ith Russia,  The present Russian offensive, hov/ever,may convince Austria-Hungary that a separate peace with Russiais out of the question for tho moment.          The interchange of visits between Vienna and Munichhas apparently given the impression that Austria-Hungary,supported by Bavaria and possibly by the other southern states,might be contemplating the proposal of a separate peace withthe Entente.           It has also been reported that the Emperor statedto Karolyi recently that he  (Karolyi) v/as mistaken in regardingPrussia and Germany as synonymous terms, and that the otherGerman states had a voice in questions of peaoe and war.  Itmight be taken that the Emperor was resolved onan Early.peace and that he expected the support of certain elementsof the German confederation.  It is more probabls hov/everthat the&apos; interchanged visits Y/ere connected with economic                                                    and
and inter-communication questions and that the Emperor was only-proposing to combine with the southern states of Germany toexert pressure pn Prussia with a v;Lew to forcing her to acceptthe policy of no annexations and no indemnities.          It is true that the Prime Minister&apos;s speech at...  .Glasgow has been favourably received^on the whole, by theAustrian press, but it cannot be deduced from this, or fromthe other evidence of a desire for an early peace, that Austria-Hungary is contemplating the conclusion of a separate peace.All that can be said is that the political situation in Austria-Hungary is such that,, while there is a general desire for peace,her future political relations with Germany make it practicallyimpossible for her to conclude a separate peace ,   The prospectof a separate peace is further embarrassed by the uncompromisingattitude towards Austria-Hungary shown in the Allied war aims,which up to the moment have offered her no future except at theprice of her dismemberment and have undoubtedly had the effect.of strengthening the resistance of the people,   Hor must it beforgotten that, though there are indications that frictionexists not only between the rank and file but also between theofficers of both empires,  the troops of Austria-Hungary areso intermingled with those of Germany and so dependent uponGermany1s military superiority not only in the higher commandbut even by the infusion of German officers in the staffs ofAustro-Hungarian divisions,  that the defection of the Austro-Hungarian army as a whole is extremely improbable.   Should,however, more moderate war aims be offered by the Allies toAustria-Hungary and should their acceptance be prevented by theGerman government and the same be made known to the people of.AUBtria-Hungary, it is possible that the present state of                                                    depression
depression is such * that a general strike might well ensue.   Inthat event, it must he remembered that the troops employed inthe suppression of such a strike would he those of the -garriso-nsand depots and there is - evidence to show that acts of sabotage -have occurred in the latter requiring stern measures ofrepression on the parts of the authorities, while the temper ofthe troops in the garrisons is by no means; improved by theeconomic conditions prevailing in the interior.General Staff,   War Office,       7.7.17.
