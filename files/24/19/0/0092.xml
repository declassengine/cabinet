gl.  UNITED STATES.     On the 8th inst, , the President issued his Pro- elamation prohibiting  the  exp or t,  except under 1 ieenee of coal, mineral&quot;--oils,  cereals, f odderstuffs, meat, iron, steel, fertilisers  and other  articles.  The accompanying statement intimates that neutrals will be expected  to husband their own resources, and that  American supplies canaot be allowed, either  directly or indirectly to feed the enemy,  Mr. Hoover, who has been charged with  the duty of conducting the consequent negotiations with neutrals, desires to insist that they should suspend all  exports  to Germany,    He proposes, as a prelim- inary to negotiations, that the neutrals  should furnish statistics of  theirminimumrequirements, of their present stores  and supplies, and of their  exports during the war to Germany and  to Allied  countries.   Our hope is that, while negotiations are in  progress, the  United  States will maintain an absolute  embargo  on the exportation of all important goods to neutral countries,  and  that no  definite rations of American products will  be promised  to  those countries.   It remains to be seen whether Mr.  Hoover will be- allowed to take such strongmeasures as he  and we desire.   But applications for exportlicences are  to be referred to London, where they will be con-sidered by the  United States Commercial Attache and the appro-priate officials of the Minis try  of Blockade.      The United States Government  have agreed in principle tothe suggestion that the cotton exchanges  of New  York andLiverpool should cooperate  to  repress speculation and to keepprices at a reasonable level.   Arrangements are also contem-plated for joint action in  regard  to the world*s supplies of
      wool,  one main object &quot;being  to  reduce  the high prices now-      ruling in South America..:          ,SPAIN.    is at present the only European neutral to which the      United States have applied direct pressure.   On the 6th inst.      King Alfonso was  told by the American  Ambassador that exports      from the  United States  to Spain would  depend  upon the atti-      tude of the Spanish Government  towards matters affecting the     ;interests, of the  Allies. . \  .      ^    On July 0 ii was announced that the  Spanish Government      had prohibited the export of unrefined olive  oil until Nov.      15.;   Thismeasure obviously affects Italian  interests.  It      will also inco&apos;nt&apos;en^S)nce our  manufacturers  of  military cloths      who are in urgent need  of olive oil.          ,BEHMHK.    The Danish Government  express surprise  at our embargo:  ;    on the importation of  cereals and  fodder.  They desire to be      informal, precisely what they may import from  overseas;  but  -     . we are not answering this question, which would be more      suitably addressed to the United States.   We may withdraw      the agreed rations of Bice,  Rice Heal. Sago flour and starches.           We do not anticipate that  the Danish Shipping Agreement      will be denounced by way of  retaliation for our embargo.      This agreement gives to Denmark an assured supply of ooal      and provides her merchant shipping with profitable  employment.            TheDanish Government  state  that* iii conseqnenee of      Sir Ralph Paget*s representations,, they have  limited the      exports of cattle to 6,000 head a week, and that this      arrangement has been in force  for  a month.            They have concluded a  new agreement with Germany by      which immunity is granted  (a)  for vessels  sailing between      the United States and Denmark   (b) for vessels carrying
cargo from Denmark to  Norway, and   (e)  for vessels bring -examination.   Those of class  (e)  may call at Bergen.   Itis not stated what Germany will obtain in return for  theseconcessions.  ,:     At our request the -Swedish Government have  stiffenedtheir decree  which prohibits  Swedish fishermen from land-ing their catoh outsideSweden.  We in consequence haveraised the embargo on mineral oils, with the  reservationthat lubricants will only be  allowed to reach the state-railways and firms which work for the Allies.  This con-cession is not intended to influence the policy  of theUnited States in regard to mineral oils. On the  contrarywe hope that  the United States will grant no  export licen-ces whatever in Sweden*S favour, until Swedish exports ofiron ore and munitions to Germany are discontinued.   Wehave informed Washington of the exceptional importance ofSwedish ore to the German iron and steel works,  which wouldhave to be reorganised if they were restricted to the useof the Inferior ores obtainable from other sources.  It is ,expected that the ore-shipments of this season from Tjuleaand dxolosund will amount to  z\ million tons.  This gjian-tity would cover Germany1 s requirements until the end of      Reports have  now been  received which indicate thatin June the Deutsche Bank remitted  75 million marks ingold to Swedish banks, and the Beichsbank sold in Swedensecurities valued at several million kroner.A Norwegian Mission is  sailing  for the United Stateson July 13;   the most prominent of the delegates Is Dr.1918.
           E. Han sen,                Various difficulties nave arisen in connection with           the Norwegian Shipping Agreement,   We have &quot;been obliged           to raise cur rates for voyages to Norwegian ports by  4.           a ton, which in the case of voyages to Bergen means an in-           crease of 40$.    The Norwegian owners complain that the           rates obtainable for cargo from Norway to the United Kingdom           are altogether unremunerative, and have asked us for compensa           tion, which we have refused,6*   ^PHERLANPS.    It appears probable that if we do not exercise our           right of purchasing a large proportion of the Butch  rait           crop the whole will go to Germany.   Immediate action is           required and can hardly be expected from the United States,           BUM, Government are considering a scheme of purchase, and           an early decision is expected.                 Owing to the obstructive tactics cf 13ie Butch Govern-           ment it has not yet been possible to arrange a permanent           scheme for the allocation of Batch shipping.  The Butch           desire to reserve for themselves that proportion of their           tonnage which would be necessary to carry the whole of their           existing rations.   This is only another instance of their        &apos;   apparent inability to realise the trend of American policy           in  regard to European neutrals.                 The Butch Government have be en informed that the           extension of our mine area in the North Sea is purely a           measure of precaution against submarines operating from           the Bight of Heligoland;  and M,  Loudon has  published this          .. explanation,   V 87*  ITALY,      The Italian Government are pressing us to permit           imports of  Italian silk Into the United Kingdom up to 70$           of  the  figure for 1916,  The limit of 50$, which we
             originally fixed,  has already &quot;been reached,  and on             political ground s it is important to provide a market for             the stocks remaining in Italy.                  The Oilcake Agreement with Switzerland has not &quot;yet             been ratified.   Some licences for the export,ef eil  cake             have&quot; been issued by the Italian Government.   But no export             has yet taken place, and the Italian Government claim the          -  right of keeping the glycerine obtained in the process of             manufacture, although the raw materials are Swiss property.             There is a danger that the agreement may come to nothing.             In that case the Swiss will be free to increase their       :      exports;of cattle to Germany. .58,  SUBMiBIgg BBOCjOlBE.
