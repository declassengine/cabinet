10  59SECRET-              WAR  CABINET.G.T. 1312         -  REPORT ON THE SHIPBUILDING SITtf ATI ON.                   by Sir Eric Geddes.w m* a- MN^Mi M Ml M*              -  It has now been  possible  to  survey the general  situation as regards both Naval  and Mercantile- Shipbuilding, ;&apos;and although  it must be understood that the  views  expressed herein  aro  given after  a  preliminary survey of  the  situation  only, the Officer^s  of my Depart- ment who have&apos;  gone into  the details as exhaustively as time has permitted, are  of  the  opinion that the figures how  put  forward can be considered reasonably  probable, subject  to no  extended Labour troubles,  changes of policy/  or other serious dislocation Interfering with output.             ,  The.line  of  thought which has  been adopted in arriving .at these conclusions is as follows:-                An ideal  programme of Warship  construction was  prepared by the Third Sea Lord,, and  a counter programme of what  could  be done to meet it by using the specialised Warship builders to the  fullest and best advantage, was submitted  by the Controller,, and approved by  the Board of Admiralty, and the War Cabinet. .An Admiralty
            &amp;n Admiralty Auxiliary Shipbuilding programmme was       proposed,  and  allowance hcs been made for this and for War       Office  requirements.            Thereafter,  the  remaining capacity of the-Yards;  end .       other resources,  hsve &quot;been considered,  tnd-we have estimated       whft  is necessary to  supplement our   capacity in  order to       attain  3.,000.;000  tons per  annum output  in the United       Kingdom which  was1 timed at by  the Controller of  Shipping       and,  I-understand, bu the  Ear  Cabinet-..            The programme of Warship  construction which  has been       approved by-the Board of Admiralty,  and by the War Cabinet,       falls considerably short of full requirements for the  Navy,       in Destroyers,Submarines;Patrol Boats,  and Sloops.;  end it       is at this stage  that  the  views of  the War Cabinet could       conveniently be sought if  the  Board  of  Admiralty  are not       content with the  situation as  to either Warships  or       Auxiliary  Craft,  and  desire to press  for an extended output       in reduction of the programme  of Merchant Shipping now put.       forward.(2)     EEVliSW  01  2RB3EHT.LQ33333,  MS  OUTPUT.                 (a)      Losses.        It will be convenient  at       this  stage to  refer to  the  possible  losses in twelve months,&quot;A&quot;     and Appendix &quot;A&quot;  sets out  the  calculations of these on two       bases               (1) on the basis of the  losses  during the first                  half  of 19lVand
                        &apos;  and        (2)  On the basis of the losses during               the second quarter of 1917.TLe second basis may be too high having regard to; thefact that the losses in the winter months have not inthe past &quot;been equal to the losses in the finer weather;but on the other hand, the activity of the submarinesmay Increase, and the losses may bo on a higher scalethan we have hitherto experienced.  From Appendix &quot;A&quot;however, it will be seen thai the losses on the twobases vary between 4,191,000 and 5,141,000 tons;  butto this must be added the loss due to seriously damagedvessels which are.not sunk.  For the purpose of review-ing the situation over the next two years, this may -not unreasonably, I think - be taken at 500,000 tonsper annum.  So that the total&apos;losses to British Tonnagemay be taken over the next year or two years of War atfrom 4,700,000 to 5,700,000 tons per annum;  and oh thesame basis the maximum figure for British and ForeignTonnage may be taken to be something between eight andnine millions&apos; of tons.           It is the task of the Allies as a wholeto sufficiently reooup these losses, so as to enablethe essential sea carryings to be maintained; for thecourse of  the War.;  It is necessary to. decide ?/hetherthe men and material aro to bo devoted.to this purposeor to other purposes.  The numbers of men required oresmall compared with the numbers employed by the Ministry                                         of Munitions/
 of munitions,  end  in  the Army.- -Generally  ape eking the Army  is now  abundantly  supplied with munitions,  the resources of the Country having &quot;been generously  devoted to  its needs.&apos; It  is  for the v-ar Cabinet  to say  whether the submarine  offensive of the enemy does not now demand a partial transference  of these resources to ?/hat may now be  described as our weaker front.  A consideration of the figures In this nenorandum show, I venture to submit, that 3uch  a transference of  our resources is both absolutely essential and urgent.          (b) Output.  The&apos; output of Merchant Tomiago from&apos;British yards during  the last eighteen months is  given  inAppendix &quot;B&quot;.  Prom this it will be seen that we  completed                                        Vessels,  ^Gross                                        _..

Theanticipated  ad&amp;iti.nal tonnage is/                                          -  as under

Prom this itappears that the copper, spolter, and timber situationsare by no means beyond anxiety;  but that Steel is theprincipal material which will, cause difficulty, Labouris the other difficulty, and the solution of both ofthese is essential if we are to seriously attempt to maintain a Mercantile Fleet.               (b)  Forecast of future Mercantile Ship-building.    The programme which may be possible in thefuture by extended arrangements for shipbuilding in thisCountry, have been considered in relation to Labour,Material and Capacity.    All the principal Shipbuildersin the Country have been consulted in detail, and thefollowing table gives the resultTo produce

 out previously in this memorandum, it is assumed that the &apos;?;ar Cabinet will at least decide upon the largest programme, viz-  the production of:  minimum of 3,110,000 gross tons of.Merchant ship^n^g per ;mnum in this Country.       It  is not, considered that the production of Marine Engines,  arid auxiliaries ana1. outfit for the  suggested programme  vail  create serious difficulties.   Generally engines are above  the output  of hulls to-day.    The shops are  enable of  expansion  in output,  and if economies in the  use of  steel for  shell, etc.,  are made,  there wi11  bo a consequent release  of workshop capacity now  devoted to work for the army, and such shops  could be  handed over, where  suitable, to  the Actairal ty  by the  Ministry  of Munitions.   It is yet toe  early to say  what additional labour will  be required in  this connection,  but doubtless a considerable proportion can be obtainedjjby  dilutionwith female  labour.      A niembrandum by Major-General Collard, DeputyControlled for Auxiliary Shipbuilding,  is attached forreference Appendix &quot;E&quot;.      From the above it will be seen that steel andlabour are the determining factors, and they are nowreferred to in some detail.      Steel.   The. total requirement of Steel for theShipbuilding programme is as followsJfflt&quot;-

I am givem to understand by&apos;the Director of SteelProduction that until certain extensions of Steel &apos;.?orksnow in progress by the Ministry of Munitions reach fruition,any further increase in Steel for Shipbuilding  can onlybe achieved by economies in other directions..      It will be seen from the. following table that only10$ of the available Steel is allotted to the productionof Shipping Tonnage -
Total        132,592       It  is possible  that  either out  of  allotmentsto Shell, Railway Material, Export, or other purposes,certain economies could be effected, which would enableShipbuilding to tide  over  the critical period untilthe Ministry of Munitions am. sufficiently expand theSteel  resources of the Country both as to production andthe rolling of plates and angles.   It Is also suggestedthat stocks of finished and unfinished munitions,  andall reserves of Steel in s raw or semi-manufactured stateshould be reviewed.      Labour.   In order to ascertain the Labour nowemployee! in Shipbuilding and  Repairing,  a report fromall Shipyards and  Engineering :7orks principally employedon Marine  Engineering,  has been called for,  and from thiswe find that - inclusive of the :Royal Dockyards,  approximately                           .

    &apos;.. 400,000 men and women are so employed.  To  thisit Is proposed to add 80.000 physically fit men  ofwhich 12.500 should he skilled labour.           As in the case of allotment of Steel, itis very striking to see what a small proportion  of theman-power of the Country is directly employed  on ourall-important Naval and Mercantile Services, as  thefollowing figures snow:.-   .  Navy.                               400,000     Army (including Colonials           at homo and Abroad.)        3,,750,000     Shipbuilding               say      4QO,000     Ministry of Munitions      say    2,360,000     Note   It must be admitted,.however, that       - /these figures cannot &quot;be taken to o         literally&apos;as between the Ministry of        &quot;Mtuaitions and the Admiralty;  -as for         instance, men.in Steel Works, aro in-        &apos;.eluded in. the Munitions\figures, but         produce Steel for. the Admiralty to - the         extent of Ifyfo.          -:  &apos;     &quot;&apos;: &apos;-:&quot;&quot;&quot;           Having regard, to .tho vital necessity  forreplacing.shipping losses and maintaining an offeneiveagainst; the enemy-fleet,. it., is submitted that  a  draftof 80,000 men now required, is comparatively small.          -It- is believed that a considerable  numberof men- in -the building trades are. out of employment atthe ,present time, or have volunteered to do substitutionwork under the. National. Service scheme.   The  terms underwhich tb..ese, men are to be remun.erat.od will cause                                         difficulties/
difficulties by their introduction into existing Ship-building yards, and dilution will at all times createdifficulties unless the men in the yards see that&apos;we arereally in earnest with the Shipbuilding programme, andthat we aro so organised that we.can at all times&apos;givefull and regular work to them,   This can only be done bya careful programme of Shipbuilding, uith careful co-ordination of the supply of Steel, Haw Materials andLabour,           It will be necessary to ask for the release  ..from the Army of men belonging to Shipyard.trades;  butit is believed that tho least inconvenience will be causedby doing so during tho  inter;, , It may also be possiblefor tho Army Council to provide for a certain number ofprisoners of War to bo used to construct ne?/ NationalShipyards, and eventually to build ahips which it is pro-posed to lay down.CONCLUSION -           It is suggested that this memorandum beconsidered by the h;ar Cabinet, and -    1.  That it should bo asked to approve tho pro-          posals for tho extended Shipbuilding pro-          gramme of 3,110,000 gross tons per annum          in tho British Isles, as a minimum;  and          such greater figure as can be attained          after furthor review of men and material          is made.  It is suggested that having          regard to the losses, 3,110,000 tons is          too low a figure.
    lib  That it should direct that that a small Committe           representing the Admiralty; the War Office,           the uinistries of Munitions and of Labour,           and the Director-General of National Service,           should be convened forthwith to consider and           report to the  .ar Cabinet as to what stops:.&apos;           can be taken to provide the necessary Steel, .           Labour and lin^ine building capacity, dealing           with the suggestions made under each heading           above, and any other suggestions which may           .oocur to them during their consideration of          . the question.           The memorandum has mainly dealt withBritish output;  but it is suggested that a copy of itshould bo sent to Lord Horthcliffo for his information,and that he should be directed to actively take up thematter with the United States Government, and ascertainfrom thorn whether they can now undertake to supplementour tonnage income to the extent of 1^- to Z million tonsper annum.           In addition to the possibility of obtain-ing further tonnage from the United States of America,consideration is bcin^ given to other possible sourcesof supply;   Appendix &quot;D&quot;, referred to above, shows howsmall the output has been in the pact from other Countrieiwhich are still open to us;  the total output of theUnited States,&apos; Franco; Italy and Japan only amountingto a little over half a million tons is the record year                                             before/
before the War..  Every opportunity will be taken toacquire any Foroign-built tonnage offering, but Neutralsand Allies havo serious losses of their own to replace.It appears to be necessary to rely mainly on the resourcesof this Country which already possesses more than anyother Nation; the experience for rapid development ofoutput.  America is endeavouring to develop a largooutput., and with, her National genius for quick improvisa-tion may be able to So so;  but I would urge that in thismattor we should endeavour to be ae nearly solf-suppertingas possible.

        It will &quot;be seen that the United Kingdomand British Colonies produced nearly, two millionton3 out of a total output of three and one-thirdmillions,1 or 60 per cent.        As.&apos;&apos;shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot; to the principalmemorandum, foreign  vessels are being sunk, at.therate of roughly three million tens per annuwhichcompares with a pre-war output, excluding enemycountries, of roughly three-quarters of a milliontons per annum..        Constant efforts are made to acquire foreignowned tonnage,, but until, foreign resources are merefully developed they hardly represent a materialjfactor in the situation.        The tonnage of vessels purchased abroadfor delivery during the second  half of 1917, and theearly part -of 1916, is as under:-                1917.              1918.               326,670          ,  592,550        In addition to the tonnage for 1918 thereis at present the further possibility of 200,.000 -tons from the U.S *A, and 80,000 tons from Shanghai. -  :The development of the construction of wooden steamersin Canada has been, thoroughly investigated and isbeing pushed forward as far as is possible,  but theoutput from this source can only be relativelyunimportant. ....

App. E,&apos;        MEMORANDUM ON THE POSSIBILITIES          OF MERCHANT SHIP PRODUCTION            IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.     Up to and including the 31st May, 1917, therewere 376,588 gross tons of merchant shipping put intoservice.   On June 1st there were 467,690 gross tonsof merchant shipping launched, waiting for engines.,outfit, etc to complete.   The majority of these shipsare being kept back owing to Admiralty orders havingbeen placed in the Engine shops with priority in frontof the merchant shipping.   it is anticipated that Itwill be possible to reorganise the work so that allthis shipping is. completed by the end of the year.     Provided that we are able to obtain the necessaryquantity of steel, it is anticipated that the launchingsup to the end of this year will be as under:-             June            120,230 gross tons.

The third way of increasing the output will be toconstruct new-yards, maraiod with, military labour and Gormanprisoners, with a capacity of 36 slips which will give anadditional 360.000 gross tons of shipping per annum.   Thiswill require labour to the extent of 25,0d0 and in orderto give the necessary nucleus of skilled labour for theseyards it will be neoessary to transfer the whole of theshipyard workers now in the army to the ne^ units that willbe required to man these new yards. .

In all these calculations of increased production,
simplification of construction and standardisation has beentaken into consideration together with the use of bridgeyardsfor doing a considerable proportion of the straight work.          In addition to the steel required for this Merchantship programme, the following amount of steel per week will berequired for auxiliary vessels including Minesweepers, LargeTrawlers,- Boom Defence Vessels, Trawlers, Drifters.

With regard to labour, the figures have, of course,been taken out on the assumption that the men are doing afair average dayrs work and that there will not be any strikes
 or  other  delays,:   It  must,however,  te remembered  that at  the present moment, labour  in some shipyards is not working at anything like  its maximum opacity.   The men are not keeping good time or working with proper energy. This, however, may improve as soon as the steel situation is put right and the;/ see that we ere really in earnest over the  question of Merchant Shipbuilding, which at thepresent time nobody in the Shipbuilding industry: believes, and this  is net to bo surprised at considering that Merchant shipping has continually been put on ono side for Otherwork.
