The battle-cruiser  and the fast battleship have rendered the whole of this class obsolete for- action with the fleets, as. they are: not strong enough to fight nor fast enough to run.  But most of them are large, powerful  ships, ranging up to 14,000 tons, and they absorb  together nearly 2,000; Anglo-American officers and  40,000 trained men, including a high proportion of skilled technical ratings.   They  mount approximately 650 guns of 6-in. to 10-in. calibre besides a much larger number of smaller guns.Armed Merchant Cruisers.British.	German.37 ships aggregating 390,000 tons.	The Germans have about 20 ships aggregating 260,000 tons, which may or may not be armed, from which individual vessels for raiding or minelaying can from time to time be selected.TABLE VIII.Light Cruisers.
