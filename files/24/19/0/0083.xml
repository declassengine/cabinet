  &quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;*,                                  Department of  Information.WEEKLY  REPORT  ON /FRANCE  VI.&quot;-*  *  .   /:  .  .  ..... -.                    FFW/VIWeek ending July 12th.    The event of the week is the conclusion of the secret  session,  thepublic declarations, of Ministers,  and the vote which followed.    It isprobably too early to pretend to certainty as to what will be  the resulton the Army and the Nation.   The Government, and especially M.Painleve and M. Ribot, achieved another personal success,  and  as  allreports point:to a better, spirit beginning again in the Army,  no  furtherdifficulties may arise for the present.   But it is known  that the secretsession produced very strong attacks on the High Command,, and its  methods,                -   -   - -.                              Mi  Ybernegaraythe most noticeable, oerhaps, being that of a young Officer Deputy/ whocriticised Generals Joffre and Nivelle and blamed  earlier Ministriesfor having been too lenient with blundering Generals-.   His speech seemsto have had a great reception. ----- M.Ybernegaray is a Conservative  and thisvery much increases the significance of Ms language which is  of  a tonevery unusual with members of the Right.   It is remarkable too that Con-j servative papers like.the Echo de Paris, should allude  with enthusiasm to his speech and regret that it cannot be reported.    Another Deputy made a direct attack  on the President of the Republic alleging that heI was responsible for the late unfortunate Offensive.   This gave theI President&apos;s enemies an opportunity to raise cries of  &quot;A Versailles&quot;,  jnesrI meaning,of course, his resignation.   But the attack  seems;to  have beenIdisposed of fairly easily. -  Finally the Chamber, by  375 votes to 23,ljdopted.the Order of  the Day approved by the Government.    Its wordingI is, as usual in Prance, much more lengthy than an English  Parliamentary[resolution;would be.   By it the Chamber declares its resolve  w to : assume the full; exercise of its control - over; all the  services  of  the
army without  interference in military operations&quot;,  and expresses itscondfidence that the Government will secure respect in all grades ofthe military  hierarchy for the ideas of equal discipline and justice forall;.&apos;, that it will realise in agreement with the Allies such a distribu-tion of the common forces as will enable France to reconcile her militaryeffort with her economic needs;  and that it will,improve the materialconditions of the soldiersfs lot.   These are the important paragraphs;the rest are,  more or less,  common form.     What do  they mean and to what do they lend?   They mean first of allevidently a pressure of that demand for the extension of the BritishFront to which cllus ion wns m: de last we ex.   But above all they po intto e. oolicy of further civil and parliamentary control over the Army.(Co how much will this amount?  What form will it take?  Will it be pressedas for as to  prove intolerable:to General Retain?     These are the important questions.   But they cannot yet be answered.It is noticeable that the much discussed nacifist paper of H, Caillaux,Le Pays, welcomes the Order of the Bay as a victory for its ideas..   Andthere is no  doubt that it, and all its friends, have always made insinua-tions against the High Command, and demanded more parliamentary controlof the Army.    But will the vague leaguase of the Order of tho Pay,which certainly goes some way in this direction, lead in practice to anyimportant change?;  The Socialist Humanite has its doubts and complainsof the vague generalities of the Order of the Day. and says that theuneasiness out of which the $ebate grow has not been dissipated.   Thefact that the Debate and the Temps express their satisfaction and regard he result as a clear victory for the Government seems to confirm thedoubts of the Humanite more than tho confidence of Lc Pays.   Neitherwould welcome anything which it regarded as a victory for the ideas of thePacifists.            . &quot;-. ./V&apos;-:-/4&apos;-&apos;   V:*.. *       &apos;        4-:/           &quot;   ., The future must give  the final interpretation.  /&quot;Meanwhile the-  -   -
 Speeches oi IU Pr/inlevo ^nd M. riibot afiord the best indications at nresent of the probable results.   M. Painleve very definitely promised thst serious faults on the part of officers should no longer escape - punishment,&quot;as.it is alleged,  ;*nd he practicelly admitted, that they now do. .  He&apos; -arcnisod freer interchange between the staff and the regimental officers:   the release of more agricultural labourers from the .Army: better methods about the soldier?s food and leave, and that such arrange- nients should be made as would safeguard the economic life of France without compromising her military efforts.   This last promise, repro- duced later in the Order of the Pay, vies of course vaguer than the others on which he must plainly take definite action.   It was accompanied by phrases about the knowledge of the Allies that France will never desert her post whatever happens, and their determination that she should not be left like a torch,: which in illuminating the world extinguishes itself. Ho doubt it is a preliminary to attempts at an extension of the policy of relieving the French military strain by British and later American assistance.   The rest of the speech was devoted to the stale of mind of the Army and the Nation, ;:nd to the choice before both, which is simply to &quot;conquer or to submit to the most odious and degrading form ofnational slavery&quot;, said M/;PainleveV adding emphatically,  and amidalmost universal applause, &quot;Whoever advises our soldiers to lay down their:arms now,  makes himself, whether he wishes it or not,  an agent of the enemy&quot;.:;&apos; U./V;&quot;-:--V;vv--vv&quot;:                                  /- &apos;              -  j    V/hat w. s interesting in the rest of the debate turned  on this sub- ;  i ject.    The leader of the Sooirlists declared his condemnation of thesecret propaganda which&apos;has caused so much discussion;   but asked for explanations about the recent eolice activity.The Minister of the Interior,  M, Malvy,  himself a  personage somewhat suspected of undesir-able relations with M,-Caillaux, explained; his action-as to the suppres- sion of the pacifist propaganda and with reference to  the strikes -
 incidentally mentioning that  they had been purely economic and that the Strikers had refused  to listen to pacifist emissaries.    He declared that there  had been far fewer strikes in France than in Italy or in England and,  that  the carefully concealed strikes in Germany have been, if we may judge by the official figures of violent deaths in certain places,  of  a far mere dangerous character.     But the matter that was  exciting the Chamber was not the strikers or the propaganda in  general, but a particular Incident to which M.Malvy in spite of interruptions  refused to refer.    It was dealt with a little later by M. Ribot  who,  after  repeating the promises about military matters made by M.  Painleve,  proceeded to deal with the pacifist agitation.   He announced that a bill weuld  be introduced to increase the punishment for these offences: and  said  that it was necessary for the police t? re- double their vigilance because there was proof that the agitation was being paid  for by  German gold.:   He then made the sensational announcement that a large cheque had been seized at the frontier on a person connected with a certain paper.   And  he stated that a prosecution had already been begun and would be rigorously. pursued to the end.     He did  not mention the name of the paper or the individual,  but every- body.knows  that the former is Le Btnnet Rouge,  a pacifist organ long devoted to  M. Caillaux,  and  the latter to one Duval.  who is connected with it.   The editor of th.t journal, M. Aimereyda is one of the Committee of M. Caillr:uxfs newly formed Republican League.    If,  as is alleged,  he sfe should prove to be implicated In this cffair the blow to the Caillaux intrigues,  which have already met with o decided set-back,  will be even(heavier.   But in  any case it will be severe enough.    If,  as seems certain from M. Ribot&apos;s words,  the cheque can be shewn to come from German sources it  will confirm the worst suspicions as to the kind of company M.  Caillaux and his  friends keep;  and will supply their enemies
with a fatally damaging answer to the question they have been raisingday after day. about &quot;Le Pays&quot;;  &quot;where does the money come from?&quot;   But we must hot anticipate the verdict of the police-court.J * C * B *
