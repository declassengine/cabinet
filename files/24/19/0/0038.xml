             pS OPOTMIA .COHHIS aiOH -j 3)1 SCIPIIIAHY ACTION                Memorandum by the. Judge Advocate GeneralS. of Sc            v      I am of opinion that a Court of Inquiry is preferable to &quot;V;a Court-Martial for the following reasons :-      1.   Tt would be practically impossible to commence           trial by Court-Martial in November,  1917,  the           latest date by which this can be done under the           Amy Act.      2.   In the event of trial by Court-Martial it would be           necessary first to take a summary of evidence and           afterwards  to call, all the witnesses at the trial..           This would  necessitate taking away a large number           of military witnesses from their duties In various           theatres of war twice instead cf once.      3,    In the  case of a Court of Inquiry a  Judge  of the           High Court  could be  made  legal assessor or under           the Army (Courts of  Inquiry Act)  1916 a member of           the Court of Inquiry.      4.    The Army Council on  the recommendation of  the           Court  of Inquiry could  recommend &quot;His Majesty to           remove  or dismiss  an Officer from the Service,           while  the maximum  punishment which a Court-Martial           could  inflict  for  any offences which could possibly           be  charged  is  cashiering  or dismissal.      5.    A  Court  of  Inquiry   could deal with matters           affecting the  Military reputation of the Officers           in  question as well  as offences.   It iscnly fair           to  these  Officers  that  this  should be conceded  .           in  view  of  Rule  124  (F) of the Bules of Procedure          under the Army Act which  provides              (F) &quot;Whenever any inquiry affects the character                 or military reputation, of  an  officer  or                 soldier,  full  opportunity must be afforded                   to  the officer or  soldier  of being present                 throughout  the inquiry, r.nd of making  any                 statement and of giving: any evidence  he may                 wish  to make  or give,, and  of  cross-examining                 any witness whose,  evidence, in his.opinion,                 affects his character or military reputation,                 and producing any  witnes^osin  defence  of his                 character or military reputation.&quot;                The Officers concerned aid not  before the  Mesopotamia Commission have  the right of.being present  throughout  the inquiry,  of cross-examining witnesses, or  fnaking a statement in their defence.9th July,  1917(Sgd.)  3?..CAS3EL           Oudge Advocate  General5&quot;
