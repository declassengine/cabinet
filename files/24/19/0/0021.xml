SECRET.WgTOY  REPORT  OM   ITALY. V/.      July 6th  1917.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information       FH7/006.Internal Politics.                 The Vote  of  Confidence.    On June S&amp;th the Chamber  affirmed  its  confidence in the BoselliGovernment by a majority of 298  (361  Ayes  to  63  Noes)   In view of thedecision arrived at some days  before  by various  sections of theInterventionists to oppese  the Government,  this^result requires someexplanation.   A majority en: Interventionists was  in favour of a&quot;general crisis&apos;, suoh as would  have  resulted in (1) the replacement of\Boselli by some younger and more  energetic  man,  (2)  a more repressivepolicy  in  the Ministry  of  the  Interior,  (3)  the retention of Sonnino atthe  Foreign Office and  of  Bissolati  in t&quot; e  Cabinet,  (4)  greater coherenceand  unity  of action on  the part  of Government,  (5)  maintenance of theNational or Coalition Chamber  of the Ministry.    If any  Combination hadseemed  achievable which would  have satisfied all these conditions thereis little&apos;&quot;doubt  that the voting  would have  gone against  the Government.     But there were very formidable  obstacles in the way of Ruch aCombination.  - In the first place Bissolati  had 4eerded  that if theBoselli Ministry were overthrown he  should  retire from politics andresume  his duties at the front.    Bissolati  is regarded  as indispens-able to a  strong War Cabinet.    He is not only leader of the ReformistSocialist  Group  but has a  strong following  in tha Country generally.His  character for uprightness  and high ideals has won him the confidenceof many who do not share his political opinions.   He represents moreover
TiWlwmiiMni.......                       - 2 r )cpular enthusiasm for the War.   The main difficulty arose however overthe question of a successor to Boselli.    Salaudra being imcompatiblewith&apos;a&apos;National&apos; Ministry, the onfcy  serious condidates were Sonninoand Orlando.   3ut Sonnino also  is said  to have  made it known that ifi general crisis1 were brought  in he should retire from public life.This is perhaps an extreme version of his  declaration.    According toSir Rennell Rodd, while unwilling to become President of the Council,S&amp;nnino might possibly have been induced to take office under Orlando.At any rate he refused to be o Candidate for the Premiership.   Orlandothus seemed to be alone in the field.    He has strong support bothamong neutralists  and interventionists.    Of his  great ability there isno doubt;   and though an ex-colleague of Giolitti  he was also a colleagueof Salandra in May 191^and shured the credit of  bringing Italy into theWar.   He is under no suspicion  apparently of luke warmness.    The con-ciliatory policy he has adopted  or permitted towards neutralism in itsvarious guises is probably regarded by some interventionists as the onchywise policy under the circumstances, while the virulent op-nosition ofothers seems to have been modified by promises made in Secret Session ofseverer measures.   He is known  to be ambitious  and it apnears that in thoearly days of the Crisis, before Parliament met, one proposed solutionvas that Orlando should on certain conditions exchange the Ministry ofthe Interior for the Presidentship of Council without portfolio.    Afterhis speech in Secret Session on  June 23rd  it 3eemed that his Candidaturehad been accepted by the mass of interventionists  and that a generalcrisis was inevitable.   But on  or about June 26th a sudden ohange ofattitude took place.   On the 28th and 29th the  liberals of the Rightthe Radicals, the group of the Democratic  Left and the Liberals of theleft, all decided at party meetings  to support the Government,  while tivCommittee of National Action ( whose members are drawn from all interven-tionist sections, and which Is nicknamed by its  enemies the Committee of
of Union and Progress) without coming to a  clear  decision at any ratewent back as regards the majority of Deputies  present,  on its nreviousdecision to vote against the Government.    This sudden change of front seems  to have been in large part due toa leading article which appealed in La  Stampa,  the/Giolittian Journalof Turin, on the 26th and which created a great sensation.    The SecretSsssiOfc, it was there maintained, though perhaps  not strictly constitu-tional, had proved a fortunate error.   It  h*d served to clear up ambiguties/and to bring nearer that revision of all values which the Stampahod advocated.   In an assembly where speech was  froe from the Restraintimposed by the prescence of the Gallery, the exaggerated pretences Ofthe Interventionists had at once been shattered.    The clamorousapplause which followed Signor Orlando&apos;s historis speech wrs a sincereexpression of the feelings of the Chamber.   It denoted the thediscomfiture of the Interventionists the &quot;solemn  consecration of the ^pure patriotism - patriotism nwre beyond that  of  all others - of acertain great personality &quot; .   The outcry raised in the interventionist press  by this  unabashedattempt at a Giolittian restoration no  doubt reflects the&apos; feelings ofDeputies, and the two together seem to,have determined n sudden re-action against Orlando.   Referring to the demand for a War Cabinet,  Boselli  in his speechon June 30th repudiated the idea on behalf  of  the Government.    &quot;Itvould create embarrassments&quot; he said, &quot; and might give  rise to erroneousinterpretations&quot;.  &quot;It is a dangerous illusion, since it oannot beOpposed that that the War Committee should act independently of theoublic servioe and would be able to remove all  difficulties&quot;   The vote is an indication not do much of confidence in  Boselli&apos;sMinistry as of the difficulties in the way of  finding an alternative
or of the fears of a Giolittiari recovery.    The fact that isolatedmembers of all Interventionist groups except the Republican votedagainst the motion,  while  more than one of the Ayes qualified theirvotes as admonitions or encouragements to  the Government, or as amatter of policy,  is sufficient proof that confidence in theGovernment is by no means  general nor the  settlement a finrl one.External Relations.Modification of \%r Aims.     Prom certain of the soeeches delivered on June 30th in opensession it is clear that in Secret Session Sonnino limited the war-aims (or peace conditions) of  Italy to her strictly $national&apos; claims.He spoke ( accorging to SIgnor Barzilai) of a ^/ar-mentality&apos; which,as applied to foreign policy,  signifies a  quite fixed and determinateprinciple of vindication of national rights (^viendieazioni nazionali)with abandonment of all secondary questions and considerations inorder to keep in view solely the principal and vital questions&quot;Italy and Greece.     H.II.Consul at Janina reported on the  20th that Italian troops &quot;erein occupation of Caneta (12 miles S. of Janina) while French troopsoccupied Miso, only 3 mile3 distant, and ^ere surrounded by Italians anddependent on them for letting  rations pass through.   neither party,he said, seemed inclined to give way..     The Corrieri della Sera  of June 30th notes as hopeful signs of adetente the statement published in French  papers to the effect that theFrench troops detached from Salonika to places in Greece vrere to berecalled to the base rnd the reported decision of Venizelos to withdrawcertain of his detachments from N.  Epirus  in order to remove all sus-picion of comitadji movements.
     The Secolo (  and its Romen fellow-journal the Ilessegero) on June 28thpublished an interview granted to its representative at Saloniki byM. Venizelos,  last December but hitherto banned  b^y the Censor.   Inthis interview M.  Venizelos expressed most fr&amp;endly feelings towardsItaly fully acknowlegging her right on military grounds to Valona andSaseno.    On the  question of K. Epirus he was firm but pointed out that&quot;he would never have sent Greek troops into that region without the con-sent of Italy,  which consent was given him  by the medium of a nowervery friendly to  Italy&quot; &quot; That occupation    he said,  &quot; had not implieda desire to establish the fait accompli   He had respected the decisionsof the Conference  of London,  and had understood that the question ofH. Epirus was to be submitted with all the other questions to theGeneral Peace Conference.    As to the Dodecanese  he was prepared fer acompromise.    Greece wOuld have no objection to the retention by Italyof Stympalia or even other islands in addition,  if she regarded it as astrategic necessity.    The declaration on the part of Greece of a state of war with theCentral Empires is treated in the Italian Press PS a&apos;platonie act&apos;which can have  no  sensible consequences in the military situation  inthe Balkans.    The interview  and the declaration give rise to e crop of articlesin the Italian  Press some of which (  e.g. those of the Oiornale d&apos; Italiaand L&apos;Idea Nazionale ) a rather violently anti - Venizelist.
