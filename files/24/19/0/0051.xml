Lonsdale -tc Prime   ,.&apos;./ Minister. dated &apos;2016.1?Dear Prime&apos;Minister,             -&apos;-The.Irish Unionist  Members have had.-under consideration  /&apos;  the  Representation of  the.People Billj  and 0 n - the i r behalf, -1     desire  to  bring-,to your notice the n;rave injusti.ce which. w i 11 .&apos;&apos; .&apos;.-: be inflicted upon the  interests which we represent,&apos;.;. unlews some -,;;     measure of Redistribution is  applied to Ireland. ; ..         .&apos;.&apos;-&apos;-&apos;:&apos;-&apos;.-&apos;.              &apos;.The Bill;is  avowedly intended to embody the two ;//:     principles of &quot;&quot;one-nan-one.vote&quot; and &quot;one vote  one value&apos;/, but     while the  first  of - these.principles is applied.to Ireland,.the     second  is  .not, and-the result is that side.by side with a great  .  /extension  of the franchise,- the existing anomalies In  --/..;-.     representation will be. perpetuated-and accentuated.          ; -&apos;               I- enclose you herein a statement which has been     prepared^ to illustrate the.unfair manner in which Irish     Parliamentary - seats are now distributed, to the.great disadvantage     of Ulster&apos;, as- compared with the rest of Ireland, and I venture     tc say-that-these-facts constitute a very strong.&apos;.case for. the     application of a scheme of Redistribution-to Ireland.             &apos;.  We do.not suggest that the present number of Irish  /   representatives  should be reduced, but we. think that, a: -    ; Boundary Commission should be appointed for Ireland,.to     redistribute the existing seats, on a &quot;fair basis, which would     give to Ulster her just share-in- the representation,, and  -     safeguard: the legitimate interests of Unionists which are     seriously threatened by &apos;;he Bill as it -stands.             :&apos;-&apos;We have put  down alternative amendments, - (l). to    /bring Ireland within the scheme of Redistribution, and (2)     to exclude Ireland from the operation of the Bill.   These.;    amendments represent the strong feeling which prevails throughout     Ulster  on this.subject, and it is only right I  should inform   &apos;.-/. you  that we shall feel bound .to strenuously oppose, the     application of the Bill to Ireland, - unless it. is .accompanied     by a fair redistribution of - seats&apos;.Yours sincerely,   :&apos; (Signed)  :;John B..Lonsdale.
   S TATEMENT PREPARED BYSIR JOHN B. LONSDALE BART. M.P.&quot;REDISTRIBUTION.&apos;&apos; .          The Speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Reformaccepted as governing any. scheme of Redistribution   . theprinciple (see Report).   &quot;:That each vote, recorded shall, asfar as possible, command.an oqual share in the House ofCommons.&quot;  \          If Ireland is to be affect e 3, at all by the Billwhy should election anomalies be perpetuated here, anddealt with in every other part of the Kingdom.   It is    ;indisputable that the&apos;disproportion a3 between Irishconstituencies is a public scandal.,   A few of such anomaliesare hereafter given.          If Redistribution is essentially necessary as ameasure of justice elsev/here, it is still more so in Ireland.Without Rcdistribution the present, anomalies will beaccentuated, rather than redressed by the measure, becausethe extensive additions to the Franchise indicated by thoBill will more than double the existing&apos;inequalities ofthe voting nower in a large nomber of the constituencies.          It is claimed that the Bill contains all thefindings set out in the report of Speaker5^ Conference, andin view of the governing principle above mentioned thereseems to fre an indication cf glaring injustice which on themerits is incapable of defence.   It is asserted by the    &apos; :Nationalists that the Act of Union protects the existingnumber of Members representing Ireland, but assuming thatargument to be well fbunded,why not redistribute seats inIreland on the same basis as it is proposed to apply toEngland, viz:*.  that the scheme of Redistribution will notreduce or increase the number of Members representingGreat Britain? .          The following anomalies are interesting whenexamined in conjunction with tho extract from a speechmade by Mr. Asquith, the then Prime Minister, during thedebate on the Second Reading of the Special Register Bill.      ... Mr. Asquith used these words&quot;With regard tothe Parliament which is going to undertake the work ofreconstruction after the war it is eminently desirable thatyou should provide an Electoral basis which will make thatParliament reflective and representative of the generalopinion of the country, and give to its decisions a moralauthority which you cannot obtain from what I may call ascratch, improvised, and makeshift electorate..&apos;&apos;
