I &quot;am informed by the Chief of the General Staff herethat the 11th Army attained all its objectives but the 7thArray failed to do so and sustained heavy losses.?   The11th Army is now preparing to resume the offensive.  Hehopes that the offensive on Western front will commence thisweek but he is unable to state definitely.  He is notsanguine as to the offensive on the Western front on accountof there being no Austrians there.  He told me that thenumber of deserters who returned by the day ordered vis:May 28th was only 15VJ*0Q0,  He says that since the takingover by him of his appointment, a month and a half ago. thegeneral situation in Petrograd had greatly improved and hedoss not look on it pessimistically.  He says the conditionof units here is bound to vary continually and it would befatal to deal with them&quot;abruptly.  In dealing with affectedunits the All-.Russisn Conference is affording the greatestassistance.  Chief of Staff of Military District v &apos; ishowever still pessimistic.       The Bolshevik! are carrying on increased agitationin several regiments, notably the Moscov/ski and PavlowskiAsgiments and 1st Machine Gun Hegiment.  Delegates from the1st of these regiments tried to bring all units outyesterday under arms to overthrow the Government but theExecutive Committee of Council of Workmen and Soldiers tooksteps to stop it.(a)    Petrograd Military District.
       Soldiers yesterday in (word omitted)  attacked aDemonstration organised by Schools of Ensigns in honourof offensive and wounded ten of the latter.       Unfortunately several of the units including someCossacks who took part yesterday in manifestations  inPetrograd in honour of offensive -turned out  with arms*Much capital will be made out of this by the Bolsheviki.
