G.T. 1137.);      According.to -information in possession of the I ,p. the ItalianNavajg ,reserve: coal stock should be 600,000 tons.      This reserve -has been drawn upon to the extent  of 100,000tens for other requirements which reduces, it to 5.00,000. tens,      This opens up a somewhat serious question, :ive./- if&quot;necessity drives the Italians into using their very importantreserve of Naval Coal for shore and other purposes,, in  suchquantity as to reduce, this reserve materially,-, it will un*.doubtedly fall&apos; Upon this Country to provide coal for  thisreserve, in order to prevent a debacle, in addition to prc-viding, as we do,- 50,000 tons per month for- current.

Any reserve nowadays is moreeasily  expended that replenished.  Any comparison between theirreserve- and ours, which is based on the Grand Fleet Expenditurecannot be of any value.      The Italians have not the source of supply in their ownCountry^ and must get their Coal from the United Kingdom or theUnited  States., therefore it. is necessary that -they should keepa far larger proportionate reserve ready for eventualities thanis necessary in our case-.      The Figure of L,-000,000 tons per annum, given as theexpenditure of the Grsted Fleet at Scapa, is slightly  over-estimated - the actual amount being approximately 900,000 tons,.
