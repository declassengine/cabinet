Confidential.Printed for the use of the Reconstruction Committee,   .  June, 1917. RECONSTRUCTION   COMMITTEE.ifMEMOKANDUM  ON  THE  EDUCATION  BILL,  1917.    To the Right Honourable D. LLOYD GEORGE, M.P., Prime- Minister.SIR,:-&apos;,.; muMgM^lM  ^0:ymm                 -:-    V  :WV:&apos;-v;    The Reconstruction Committee begs to forward to His Majesty5s Governmentthe enclosed Report on the draft Education Bill submitted  to the Cabinet by thePresident of the Board of Education.    2.  The  Committee are unanimously of opinion  that a continuation  systemgiving instruction only for eight hours a  week is inadequate and uneconomical.They  are agreed that half-time instruction up to the age of 16 should be made com-pulsory at the close of the war, instead of eight hours a week to the age of 18,.asproposed in the Bill.   .3.  A majority of the Committee recommend that within a period of five yearsthe universal school-leaving age should be  raised from 14 to  15 and that half-timeattendance at continuation schools should be made  compulsory up to the age of  18.A minority of the Committee dissent from these proposals.   They consider that aschool-leaving age of 15 is desirable and are in agreement with the proposal in theBill to empower the local  education  authority to adopt byelaws establishing 15 asthe age of exemption, but they are not of opinion that  it is practicable to make thisage compulsory.  Also they are not prepared to make any recommendations at thepresent time as regards continuation  education beyond the age of 16.    4.  The  following considerations which are  dealt with at greater length inthe accompanying Report  are urged  in support of the amending proposals :        (a)  Educational reform is a part of the  general problem of Reconstruction             With which the Government has undertaken to deal.  The economic             objections to a higher full-time school-leaving age and a more ample             part-time secondary education are valid only when directed against             an isolated measure of educational reform.   They lose  their force if             the Education Bill is part of a comprehensive scheme of Reconstruction             which will deal inter alia with low wages and  the legal limitation of             the hours of  work of adolescents.       (b)  The larger scheme would in the long run cause less  dislocation to industry             than the narrower scheme embodied in the draft Bill. Employers are             anxious above every thing for finality, to learn  where they stand and             what they may expect; granted this, they can  reorganise production             to meet a shortage of child-labour.   If the narrower scheme is adopted             they will have no finality; no educationalist will accept it as adequate,&apos;             and there will be increasing agitation for further reform.                 Further,  a full time school leaving age of 15 and half time beyond             that age would involve  no interference with  existing customs of entry             and training in the chief industries of the country; it would, however.             effectively check the flow of juveniles into blind  alley occupations.       (c)  Sound  physical  development  during the years of adolescence must be the             foundation of any system  of continuation education.  The evidence of             recruiting officers  points  to the existence of widespread physical  de-             terioration, which could in large  measure be prevented by securing             adequate rest and  recreation during the years of adolescence, together             with the opportunities of  systematic  physical  training which  an             adequate system of continuation schools alone can give.(11995-40.)

id)  We are strongly of the opinion that the fullest advantage should be taken      of the new interest in education and the general dislocation of indus-      trial arrangements which the transition to peace will involve.  These      constitute  a unique opportunity  for Reconstruction.   The  general      public would, we  believe, respond  to a large social policy of which      education formed a prominent part, whilst it &quot;would remain unmoved      by smaller measures.(e) We submit that these two proposals, i.e., a  full-time school-leaving age of      15 and half-time schools to 18 to be fully adopted within five years -      are objects  which should be definitely put  forward as part of  the      educational programme of the Government. If this is done, it will give      an enormous impetus to the advancement of  general public education      in this country, and we believe that it will result economically as well      as socially and  politically in benefits  which will  far  outweigh  the      disturbance and loss involved in the change.  Continental countries      ha,ve adjusted their industries to a much greater,tax in.the form of      military service.  It. is surely well worth asking Britain to begin  the      new era by a striking measure of educational provision and  to give      thereby an evidence of its leadership in  work which,is essential to  the      realisation of an educated democracy.                                         I  am, &amp;c,                                         7  E. Si MONTAGU,   ;  &apos;  .y                                                      Viee-Chairmaii.

MEMORANBUJI- ON THE  EDUCATION  BILL,  1917.                             GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. (.1) Education and other aspects of Reconstruction.     Before proceeding to make our observations upon  the Education Bill, we  propose to state briefly. th.e considerations which we believe should be borne in mind in dealing; with Educational Reconstruction.     Education should, in our opinion, be regarded in conjunction with other aspects of Recon- struetion..  The great  political, social and economic changes which  will be inevitable after  the war, in this as in other European countries, call for educational developments on a similar scale. The success of any social or industrial policy, for example, which the Reconstruction Committee might put forward is ultimately bound up with the success of educational.developments.   The Reconstruction Committee, acting on the instructions of the Prime Minister, must take the long view and the large  view of the post-war situation.  It is its duty  to consider not merely  the period of transition from war to peace, but the whole question of our future development.     The  success,  however,, of  any social and industrial policy which may  lie put  forward is dependent,  more than  upon any other single  factor, upon educational developments during  the period in question. (2) Education and, Physical Development.     There is reason to believe  that the evidence of recruiting officers points to  the existence of serious physical deterioration among large classes of the population;  the development of a sound physique in the rising generation depends in no small degree upon securing adequate rest and recreation in the  years of adolescence, together with the opportunities of systematic physical training which an adequate system of continuation schools alone can give. (3) Education and, Economic Considerations.     The  financial questions  involved  in  jjroposals for  educational  reform  raise  important economic considerations to  which  the Reconstruction Committee  is  giving its attention.   We believe that there is no considerable body of opposition  in this country to education as such;  the opposition which  exists is primarily economic.  It is quite clear, however,  that the economic system which produces the wealth needed for all purposes,  including education, can be made much more productive.  Great strides have  been made during the war in the direction  of greater economic efficiency, and the burdens which a comprehensive scheme of educational reform would impose now present  no serious  difficulty.  .   These burdens are of two kinds.  There is, first, expenditure from rates and taxes.  There can be no doubt that increased production will, without excessive strain, yield the revenue needed for purposes of educational development,  including, where  necessary, maintenance  allowances for adolescents.  There is,  secondly,&quot;the burden upon  parents.   Low wages  have, in the past, been the most formidable obstacle to raising the school leaving age; but it is generally accepted that in the  future industry will be able to pay higher wages than has  previously been the custom. In  other words, extended educational opportunities need not mean  either crushing taxation upon the community or economic hardship to individuals; and if these difficulties can be avoided, then such opposition as exists to educational reform will  be removed.     In the long run, better education will result in a willingness  to spend money on education, while by increasing the productivity of industry, it will render such sacrifices less necessary.     Lastly, we would  point out that the country has a  clear opportunity of facing the question of  the ways in which it will spend its income.   We do not wish to press the  claims of education too far, but we suggest that liberal expenditure on education must  mean  ultimately  much less expenditure on the resxilts of physical inefficiency,  on  drink, on poor law institutions  and other agencies forjrablic relief. (4) Limitation of Working Hours.     Further, we would point out that, apart from educational considerations, and merely in the interests of the physical health and moral  well-being of the community,  legislation  should be introduced  establishing a legal working day for all employed young persons.  Such legislation should, no doubt, form part of the factory and workshop code of the nation.   But its enactment would greatly facilitate the educational reforms with which the Bill  before us is concerned.   On this question, the Reconstruction Committee hopes shortly to submit a report. (5) The need for settling general policy.     We believe that the practical difficulty of instituting such a system as we contemplate can be  considerably  mitigated if  it  is introduced by  gradual stages.   But  we hold  strongly that  the  broad  principles  of educational  policy,  which  include  the ultimate  establish-: ment  of a higher  full time  school  leaving  age and  half time   secondary  schools,  should be  determined  in advance,  at  a time when the mind  of the  country is especially alive to the need for educational   progress.  Educationalists would agree that our  national  system of education has  suffered iii the&apos;past from hand to mouth legislation and from the  recurrent controversies surrounding  it.  The  question  of the amount of time to be  given to  education is one of the large  questions of policy  which  can reasonably be settled  with  some degree of certainty without the prospect of a constant renewal of discussion.
                                 B.  Continued Education.    .  Attendance at  continuation  schools  for 8    Half-time attendance at continuation schoolshours per week or 320 hours  per year to be   (say, for 16 to 20 hours -per week) to be mademade compulsory  at the end of the war, from   compulsory at the  end of the war from  thethe age of 14 to 18 for all young persons as they   age of 14  to 16 for all young persons as theyreach the age of 14.                             reach the  age of  14 and  within  a period&apos;not                                            &apos;   exceeding 5 years  to be made compulsory from                                               the  age of ceasing full time attendance (14 or                                               15) to the  age of 18.(7)  The desirability  and -practicability  of the alternative proposals.    (a) On educational grounds there is, of course,  a strong case for raising the school leavingage, at any  rate,  to  fifteen  and there  is a large body  of  evidence  in  favour of  this step onphysical, grounds.  Moreover,  there  is a growing volume  of  industrial opinion which  wouldregard the proposal  with favour.   The first years of industrial life, so far as the  majority ofjuvenile  workers are concerned, are of little real valne to the community.  It is significantthat the  age of  entry into skilled trades is usually  15 or 16.   To  raise the school leaving  agewould shorten the working life of the  industrial population by a relatively small amount, itwould deprive the community  of  labour when  it is of least value (in this respect  differingfrom  continental  systems of military service),  and  it would  prevent  the subtle  deteriorationwhich is all  too often the result  of  the temporary work which fills the  gap between leavingschool and entering  permanent employment.    It is to  be remembered also  that  the  Trade Union Congress has  for many  years passedresolutions in favour of raising the school  leaving age to sixteen.   The proposal to raise it tofifteen will not, therefore, meet with the opposition of the general  body of organised labour,but only with the opposition of individuals.           -v  &quot;,    (b) We  place great  stress on  the importance  of  half time  attendance  at  continuationschools.  Eight hours per week as suggested  in the Bill appear to us inadequate.  There is clearlya great educational advantage  in  the more ample time we  suggest,  not only because it wouldrender possible  a  wider curriculum and fuller  provision  for  physical training,  but becauseyoung people will tend to gauge the relative  importance of work. and education accordingto the amount  of time devoted to each.   It appears to us inevitable that,, if attendance  atcontinuation  schools  is  limited to  eight  hours, a  week,  it  will  not be  taken   sufficientlyseriously by  young people and that it will be robbed of much of  its value because it will bedeemed subsidiary to wage earning employment.    (c) In suggesting a period  of five years as the period at the end of which the universal fulltime school leaving age should  be raised to fifteen, we  have been, guided by  a regard, for thedifficulties to be faced, more particularly  that  of  securing teachers.    Eive  years after theappointed day will mean perhaps six or seven years from the present, a period of time in whichwe believe a policy of providing teachers would fructify.  This holds,  of course, also with regardto&apos;our proposals  for&apos; continuation schools.  In addition, we have considered the industrial aspectof the question.  - We believe it will result in less  dislocation to  establish half time at the outset,rather than to subject industry to subsequent periodical dislocation by raising the hours ofattendance at continuation schools.  Eurther,  we are of opinion that it will create  less disturb-ance in the future to raise the  age of half time  attendance  from 16 to 18 than to  increase,thenumber of hours of attendance at school for all employed juveniles between the ages of .14 and 18.11995    We  are; strongly ; of the opinion tkat the fullest advantage should be taken-of  the  newinterest in education and  of the unique/ opportunity which lies to  our hand.   The generalpublic would, we believe,  respond to a  large social  policy of which  education formed a partwhilst it would remain unmoved by smaller measures.                   The School Leaving Age and Continuation Schools.(6)  Alternative Proposals.    We  shall have at a subsequent stage in our memorandum to call  attention to  certain othermatters in respect of which we desire to see alterations made in the Bill.  We wish here  speciallyto emphasize what appears  to.us the inadequacy of its proposals with regard to  two  points whichare  of the first importance:  (1) the proposal to raise the age of compulsory full time attendanceto 14 and (2)  the proposal to make attendance at continuation  schools compulsory for 8 hoursper week or 320 per year for all young persons between 14 and 18.    In order to facilitate comparison between the proposals contained in the Bill and those whichwe  submit on the subject of raising the age of full time attendance and the amount  of time to begiven to  continued education, we set out the main points in which they  differ in  parallel  columns.                                 A.  Full Time Education.                       &apos;  v    &quot;;              Proposal of Bill.                            Alternative  proposal.  All exemptions under 14 years of, age to be     All exemptions under 14 years of age to heabolished.    Local  education authorities to be   abolished  and  the   age of  full covipulsoryempowered to raise the full time school leaving&apos;   attendance at school to he raised to 15, within aage to 15.                                      period  not  exceeding 5 years after  the  Act                                               comes into operation.         &apos;
     (d) The,point on which we differ from  the  Bill and the Memorandum  accompanying itis that of the practicability of the larger proposals which we advocate.  The difficulty is in themain, and apart from minor issues, threefold.  It is said -       (1) That there willbe a &quot;great difficulty in securing the necessary supply of competent-             teachers.&quot;       (2) That there will be &quot;great difficulty in providing accommodation,&quot; and       (3) that any more extensive proposals than those contained in the Bill would involve an             excessive interference with the industrial life of the community.     These criticisms have weight, but the degree of weight to be assigned to them must dependto some extent upon the level or urgency upon which educational reform is thought to stand.The public is increasingly disposed to regard education  as a pressing problem, and we believethat it will  undertake, on  behalf of a bold  policy appealing to its imagination and patriotism,burdens from &quot;which it would shrink if they were accompanied by a comparatively small measureof reform.(1) Teachers.     The Lewis  Committee estimates  (Paragraph 41)  that 32,000 additional full time teacherswill be required by 1921 if the  proposal to make attendance  at continuation  schools  between14 and 18 had come&apos;fully into operation by that date, or  an additional 8,000 in each of the  fouryears following legislation. -     If our proposal (16-20  hours up to the age of 16). were adopted, the yearly  increment in thenumber of teachers necessary in the first two years would be doubled.  It would be 16,000 inthe first year, and 32,000 in the second (instead of in the fourth).  No further increase wouldbe needed for three years.  But at the end of that period (five years after the passage of the Act)it would again be necessary to find 16,000 additional teachers in each of two successive years, b3&quot;which time it is hoped that the normal supply of teachers will have been increased.  The diffi-culty will arise, therefore,  in the first two years.   Is it possible to find 32,000 teachers in twoyears/instead of. (as contemplated by  the Bill) in four years?  &apos;   We&apos; submit that the difficulty stated thus is not such as should be allowed to outweigh themanifold  advantages, inherent in the larger  scheme which we propose.   We would point out, inthe first place, that the extent of the problem will depend very largely upon the type of continuededucation which it is  desired to develop.  It will, we presume, contain three main elements:-      (a.) Physical training;      (6) General education, preparatory to citizenship;      (c)  Technical and industrial training, related to particular trades and localities.     We suggest that  much of the education given in continuation schools would be of  a kind,therefore, in which teachers other than professionally trained  teachers will  play a  useful  andindeed an indispensable part.   The ultimate ideal&apos; is the establishment of a corps of permanentand  trained teachers, and  this question must be  kept steadily in mind.  There are with thecolours about 20,000 male  teachers who should be  demobilised at the earliest  opportunity.  Itis suggested that it would be possible to use a  proportion of these teachers  for continuationschools, and to  continue a little longer the emergency measures which have  been  adopted tocarry oh the teaching in the elementary schools without these 20,000 teachers.   For the moment,however, it is not-so much  a question of drawing recruits in thin streams through the ordinaryprofessional channels, as of appealing to men and women of intelligence and public spirit in allclasses who  desire to take part in rebuilding the new  England.   We assume also that thePresidents proposals for securing an  adequate standard of payment for the teaching professionwill be adopted.  We would suggest that, if it be possible  by a national appeal and  the  offer ofsuitable inducements  to recruit workers for agriculture,  similar means would  be successful inrecruiting people for the work of education.     As examples of sources whence teachers might be obtained, we would point to  (a) selectedofficers and  N.C.Os.  of  the new armies.   They would  obviously be  invaluable for physicaltraining,  and many  might also undertake teaching of  a general character; (b)  temporarycivil servants  of  the professional classes,  who,  like many  soldiers, will,  find  the  periodafter the  war one  of considerable  uncertainty  and   who   would  be willing   to  under-take teaching  work  for a time;  (c) scoutmasters  and workers  in clubs  and  settlementsand workers in  T.M.C.A. huts who have experience of a kind which would be useful; (d) skilledartisans, foremen and forewomen many of these have the qualifications needed by successfulteachers, and would be attracted by  the security and status of their  employment;  (e)  womenwho have gained experience in public service during the last three years, and who, if secureda livelihood, would be glad to continue social work  of another kind.   We  place considerableemphasis  upon  the possibility  of obtaining the services of a large number  of women.   Wewould point out &quot;that, roughly,  half  the pupils in continuation schools will be the girls,  andthat so far as. this half is  concerned  the problem is  not one of  great difficulty.  It may alsobe remarked that sofar as  the other half of the pupils is concerned, i.e.,  the boys, the possibleuse  of &quot;women  teachers to  some  extent should  not be overlooked.  It  is worth, rememberingthat in the United  States  of America about 90  per cent,  of the teachers are women,  and,although&quot;this proportion is much higher than is desirable, it  does at any rate suggest that afuller utilisation of women teachers in this  country is possible.   .     We desire to  emphasise that what is needed is to divert social interest  into this new  andfruitful  channel,  and  not merely  to rely upon  those  who  would normally   enter  theprofession of teaching.  The immediate problem is analogous  to that which faced  the nationwhen it was necessary to find officers and  N.-C.Os. for the new armies, and it must be solved
by  analogous methods  and in  the  same  spirit.  The ultimate question is,  however, one  oftraining an  adequate supply of  teachers, and, if immediate steps are taken, it should  bepossible to secure a greater flow of candidates into the profession which will meet the needsof the time when our full scheme would be  in operation.                 -  &apos;    &apos;(-&amp;) Buildings. Here, again, vthe  difficulty is that of  improvising a supply  in  a  periodtoo short  to  allow of its being increased  in  the normal manner.  For each  year that  passesit will obviously become less-acute, and the initial temporary difficulty should  not be allowedto thwart the permanent and growing advantages of  the larger policy.  We suggest that itcan be overcome.  Not only is there some accommodation in existing school buildings, especiallyin technical schools, but temporary buildings erected for war purposes in suitable places mightbe of service.  But the main source of supply must,  provisionally at least,  be found in thehiring of  private houses.  In almost every town an educational  authority would-find; it prac-ticable to lease such houses in a sufficient  number to meet the needs of its area.  They would,of course, accommodate fewer children  than the ordinary school building..  But  we regard thatas not wholly a disadvantage.(c)  Industrial Reactions.                                                           - ,    We are  not sure precisely what  weight the  Memorandum  on the  Education Bill, 1917,assigns  to the  common  objection  that, whereas a system of  compulsory continued educationfor  an average of eight hours per week is economically practicable,  a system  of  compulsoryattendance for more than eight hours (e.g.,  16 hours). is not.&apos; It could be argued, indeed,that  the  interference with industry contemplated by&apos; our proposals is far  less, than  everyContinental employer submits to as a matter of course  in connection with the  different systemsof compulsory  military training  obtaining in those  countries;  and,  that in  the long-run,employers  of. labour will  benefit  by continued  education  equally with other  classes of thecommunity.(d)  Apart from these larger considerations, we would point out that:         (i)  We are assured by many employers that  a half  time system, involving two shifts             of  adolescent labour, is  likely  to cause  less  interference  with  industry than a             system such as that  proposed in the  Bill, under; which  there would  not be two             shifts or relays but  a  multiplicity of shifts.   Thus,  if (for example) one relay             of young persons attended school for the  first half of the week and another relay             for  the second half, there would be  one break  per week, and one only, in the             continuity  of their work, whilst there would  be no breaks in the middle of a             shift.  If  they attend for four  hours one day  and  four on another, as contem-             plated by  the Bill  (still more if they  attend for,two hours on each of four  days),             the number of relays,  each  involving a break of continuity, must be increased.             Indeed, we  do not  see how the  men  training  learners  (not. to:  mention other             difficulties) can be expected, in  such -circumstances,  to  take- the -interest which             is desirable in  the work  of  the. boys  working  with them.   Economically, the             &quot;clean cut&quot; of a half time system involves  less disturbance.       (ii) What the employer  desires  in  educational or industrial legislation is finality.  He             wants to &quot; know how he stands,&quot; and how lie  will stand five years hence.   If a             system of compulsory attendance for only  eight hours per week becomes law, there             will undoubtedly be an agitation on the part of educational reformers to  increase             the  hours to more than eight, and industry will be subjected to. a fresh period of             uncertainty.  There will,  of course, be great difficulty in. &quot;breaking the  gauge &quot;             and.making another one,  say, a ten hour per week basis.      (iii) The  effect, of introducing a half time system would no  doubt be  to diminish the             employment of boys in certain  industries in which they  are employed merely             because they are cheaper than men; because the diminution of supply  would tend           .  to increase the rate of  pay.   But, though this may  cause some temporary incon-             venience to some employers; the large number of industries which rely on recruiting             their staff  at the age  of .18 to  20 would draw on. a. better trained and more efficient             supply of labour.   Further substitution of&apos;men for boys in certain trades would be             socially advantageous, especially in view of the necessity of making room  for men             and women in industry on the termination of the war.       (iv) The proposal to raise the age of full lime attendance at school to 1-5 will cause little             industrial  disturbance, provided  adequate notice (five years in our proposal)  is             given of the change.  In many important industries (Iron and Steel, Engineering,             Shipbuilding, Building, &amp;c.)  it is customary,  as  it is, not to take  boys On under&apos;.&apos;.&apos;.       the age of  15 (or even of 16).   In the interval between school and regular industry,             they become demoralised by casual and irregular work..  So far from suffering, the             employer in these industries would gain if that interval were shortened.    We have dealt  with these  two points,  the age  to which full time attendance  is  to  bemade  compulsory and the period of time to be given (per week or per year) to continued educa-tion, at some  length, because we  desire to emphasize  at once the advantage and the practicabilityof a larger policy than that contemplated in the Bill.  Apart.from  these two great questions, wedesire to suggest  alterations on certain matters which, though less vital, would be of  importancein their effect on the education  of the nation.(8)  Cost of suggested proposals.  :  ItLis impossible for.  us to form an estimate of the  additional cost of the proposals which wehave  submitted.   We have not at our disposal the necessary information on which  such an
 estimate must be based.   Qn the basis  of the.rough estimate given in the Lewis  Report, we may, however, make a rough-and-ready calculation.   Our suggestion, assuming for simplicity of calculation, attendance at continuation schools for 16 hours a week between the ages of 14 and 16, will cost, much the  same as the proposals?in&apos;-thei Lewis Report and those contained in the Bill (viz., eight hours a week attendance between the ages of 14 and 18).  The Lewis Committee put the &quot; gross maintenance cost &quot; of its proposals &quot;at anything from 6 to 8 million pounds a year &quot; ; but it was not &quot;in a position to offer  an estimate, of the cost of providing buildings.&quot;  The. utilisation of large private houses, as we have suggested, would reduce considerably, the cost per school place.   If attendance were compulsory for twenty hours a week, the cost would be. somewhat- greater.  If our further proposals were adopted (viz., the raising  of the sellool leaving age to 15, and continuation  schools from 15 to  18),  then provision would  need to  be made for full  time attendance of all boys and girls of fourteen,  and there would be three age groups (15, .16 and 17) in the continuation schools instead of two (14 and  .15).  According to the  Lewis -Report, the cost of converting all half timers into full timers  and keeping all children up.to the age of 14 maybe put at anything from  1,000,000 to  1,250,000.   The raising of the school leaving age from .14 to  15 would affect  a larger  number of children, and the  annual  cost  might amount to  2,500,000 or  8,00.0,000.  On the  basis of  the Lewis Report, the cost of continuation schools from 15 to 18 (i.e., for three age  groups) would be roughly half as much  again as the cost from 14 to  16 (i.e., for  two  groups), and would be anything  from 9 to 12  million pounds.   The total cost of our proposals would therefore be  11J to .15 million  pounds.   The cost of the proposals in the Bill would be 1 to If million  pounds, for the abolition of half time and the raising of the school  leaving age to 14, and  6 to 8 million  pounds for continuation schools, a  total of 7 to 9  million pounds.  The additional  cost of our.proposals, would,  therefore, on this calculation, be 4^ to 5f million pounds  for maintenance.                             OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE  BILL. (9) (i) Employment of Children.    Clause 13 deals with  the amendment of the. Employment of Children Act of 1903.  We welcome  its  recognition  of  the unsatisfactory  nature  of   the condition  which that ( Act endeavoured  to regulate.   It  is  undoubtedly  the case that the several  hundred  thousand children at present employed  before and after school hours as milk sellers,  errand boys, news-paper vendors, and in  other  occupations  are crippled in their  educational work by fatigue and are liable to  be demoralised by. the casual nature of their  occupation.  But the  proposal of the Bill to  subtract two hours from those in which they may be thus employed is inadequate. They would  still  be overworked; their education would continue to  suffer;  and experience shows that the policy of mere regulation is one which, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make administratively effective.   We would point out  that  the  Bill  abolishes partial exemption  and full /time exemption below  the  age of 14. notwithstanding the poverty of the parents or any questions of industrial difficulty and dislocation  which might arise.  Children employed out of school  hours  are engaged in all kinds of  miscellaneous occupations, and theirvalue to industry as a  whole is relatively  small.   Their  earnings,  moreover, are,  in the aggregate, of much less account than&apos;the  earnings  of  &quot;half-timers&quot;  and full-time  juvenileworkers under 14, whose employment the Bill proposes to prohibit altogether.   We submit,therefore, that there is  a strong case for also completely prohibiting  (as distinct  from merelyregulating) the employment of  children of  school  age  for purposes of  gain on the days onwhich  they are under an obligation, to  make full time attendance at school.(ii) School Medical Service.    Clauses  .15,  16 and  .1.7  provide for  the  extension of the school  medical service toadolescents.  This, in  itself,  is to.be welcomed.   But we suggest that  the duty of  makingadequate  provision  for  medical  treatment  should  be. obligatory - upon - all  Local EducationAuthorities.   We  need  do  no more than  refer to  the  grave revelations of physical defectsamongst, school children contained in Sir George  ISTewman&apos;s reports, and to his statement thatonly about half the children suffering from them  are successfully treated at the present time.(iii) Increase in hours of Attendance at  Continuation  Schools.    In  Clause .10  (1), the proposal  is made  that  after the expiration of  five years the Boardof Education  may, with the consent of  the  Local Education Authority,, increase the  numberof-Jiours of attendance at continuation schools required  under  this  Act.  We have  alreadystated our  views on the larger  policy,  but  if this is not  adopted then  we  suggest that  theobligation to increase the hours of attendance should be made  compulsory on all local educationauthorities and that the words &quot;with the ,consent of the Local Education. Authority &quot;  shouldtherefore be deleted.  The piecemeal system suggested in  .10  (1)  would give  rise to industrialobjections.   Eurther, if different increases were adopted for different classes of young personsor in different areas,  the  change  would result  in  differential treatment which would beresented.     ....(iv) Prematurely exempted scholars.                          -    Clause 10 (2) subsection (1)  fails to  provide any continued education for the large  numberof children who have been prematurely exempted from school  attendance owing to  circum-stances arising out of the war.  This we  deem to be a grave defect, as we  hold that the countryhas. a serious responsibility towards this section of  the child population.   It may be undesirableto treat this matter  in the present Bill, in which case we suggest that it be dealt with in aseparate Bill.   This question of prematurely exempted scholars is now under the  considerationof the Reconstruction Committee.
(v)  Questions arising between L.E.A. and employer.    Clause 10 (4) provides that &apos;&quot; if any question arises between the local education authority andthe employer of a young person, whether a requirement made under this subsection is reasonablefor the purposes aforesaid, that question  shall be  determined by the Board of Education, and ifthe Board of Education determine that the requirement is unreasonable they may substitute suchother  requirement as they think reasonable.&quot;  We suggest that the clause be amended by theaddition  after &quot; employer of a young person&quot; of the words &quot;or between the local educationauthority and any labour  organisation.&quot;  Circumstances  are  not  unlikely to  arise when thereasonableness of  the  requirements  made under  this section may be questioned not  only byemployers, but by organised bodies of workers.   It is  obviously desirable that the Board.ofEducation should  have the power of deciding in such circumstances as well as in those con-templated by the words contained in  the Bill.(vi) Acquisition of land.    Clause 27 (1) deals with the  acquisition of  land by  local education authorities.   As theacquisition of land by public authorities is to be the subject of consideration of a Sub-Committeeof the Beconstruction Committee, presided over by Mr. Leslie Scott, K.C., M.P., we suggest that&apos;this question be dealt with by such legislation as may be passed to put into operation the findingsof this Sub-Committee.    With the general principles of the Bill we are in hearty  agreement,  and welcome it as agreat step forward.   We would suggest, however, that the question of amending those clauses to&quot;which we have drawn attention should be further considered.
