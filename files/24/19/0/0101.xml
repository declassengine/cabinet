                       War Cabinetsour/45.      Employment of Coloured Labour with the Expeditionary Force.     Note by the Secretary of State for War.           In accordance with the decision of the WarCabinet (War Cabinet 172 (5)) I have considered thepossibility of dispensing with Chinese labourers and ofreplacing them by Indian.   Representatives from G0.H9Q,.France, who recently attended a Conference at the War Office,pointed out that one Chinese labourer was equivalent to fourIndian and that this proportion would probably increaseduring the Winter,-   Difficulties. inregsfrq,;-i-o the employement of Indian labour are not Confined to home but are &apos;also experienced in theatres of war.   There appears to beno doubt but that Chinese Labour is not only-.the best butalso in the long run the cheapest.          It Was further pointed out that the replacementof British&apos; labour was impossible because practically all ofit was now used in the danger zone, i.e. within ten milesof. the trenches.   Coloured labour only commences to beutilised at this point, while prisoner of war labour isconfined to working behind a line 30 kilometres in the ,rear of the trenches. ,                             DERBY.
