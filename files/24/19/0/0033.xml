                             v                  2WAR  CABINET.SECRET.G.T. 1332.&apos;-        .           .THE  PREVENTION  OF  EXPORT   OF  PRINTED.  MATTER.      MEMORANDUM  BY  WAR   OFFICE  AND  DEPARTMENT   OF                                INFORMATION.     1. The question of the prevention of the export of matter printed  and- publishedin the United Kingdom is likely to raise so many intricate points in the future  that  itis  important  to  come to  a clear  understanding of our policy.  The difficulty of thequestion  is that we have not;  adopted a scientific  system of Press control  at home.There is no obligation to submit printed matter to the-Press Bureau.   If a  newspaper,book or a magazine contains objectionable material, the  only remedy is action under theDefence of the Realm Regulations.     2. Our only real censorship of published matter is applied with regard to export.The procedure is that the  Postal Censors call the attention  of the Director  of SpecialIntelligence at the War Office to any  suspect publication, and the Director  of  SpecialIntelligence, when the matter is not military or naval, takes the opinion of the ForeignOffice and the Home Office.   Any  steps to prevent export are taken on the responsi-bility of the military authorities.     3. This is  obviously  an  unsatisfactory arrangement, for  with the publication  ofobjectionable  material  in  this-country most  of the harm  is  already  done.   This  iscertainly true of objectionable matter published in newspapers or  periodicals which areregularly sent abroad, for  an offending issue  obtains such a  start that it  is  usuallyimpossible to detain it.  In the  case of books and  pamphlets  detection and  detentionare simpler.                                                       &apos;  -     4. A certain  number of technical works  contain  matter of great value to theenemy, though the author and publisher are quite innocent of any unpatriotic intention.(Burrs &quot; Aero Engines &quot; and Judge&apos;s &quot; Properties of Aerofoils and Aerodynamic Bodies&quot;may  be cited as examples.)  Copies  of such works are  detained, the books  are placedon the prohibited list, and the  publishers  informed.  In such cases the action taken isseldom resented, and the  chance of a  copy of the  publication reaching the enemy  isremote.     5. The  principles on which  the  veto  on export-apart  from  that on technicalpublications is founded at present seem to be three :      (a.)  That the work contains something objectionable from a military or naval point           of view ;     (6.) That the  work - contains  passages which  may prejudice  His   Majesty&apos;s           relations with  foreign powers ;     (c.) That the work contains material likely to encourage the enemy or form a basis           for dangerous  enemy propaganda.                                                                     i     6. With regard to (a) and  (b) the  principle is clear and must  be maintained  in allcases in which the veto can be made effective.  Such cases are books and pamphlets andpublications not  of a periodical nature:  In the case, however, of current publicationsregularly sent abroad, such as newspapers (other than technical journals), it is probablethat  the steps taken to prevent export are  so  seldom effective in  preventing the trans-mission to the enemy of the offending  information that it is proposed in future to takeno steps to prevent export in such cases.     7. With regard to (c) the principle is  itself  doubtful.  It  is a most difficult one  toaPPty rightly and consistently with a reasonable amount  of free expression of opinion.Rigidly applied,  it would  rule out any criticism whatsoever of the British Government.Again, tue most innocent phrase can  be distorted by the  enemy  for propagandistpurposes.   There is no paper in Britain since the war began which could not  be claimedas an offender on this ground.   Most of the speeches made by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers,all Parliamentary debates, all newspapers,  and all the leading reviews, contain materialwhich, adapted or unadapted, can be used to encourage the enemy.     8. At the present stage of  the war the application  of this principle is likely  to domore harm than good.  In the first place, the entry of America as an Ally makes a realdifference.  America, with her strong belief in the free  expression  of opinion, will resentany attempt to spoon-feed her as to the export of literature, except on very definiteand defensible grounds.   But these grounds are hard to find, for the rule cannot beapplied fairly  An article may be written with an honest purpose,&apos; and may be of greatvalue for British opinion,  and at the same  time  be  seized upon by the enemy as good     (B17/457) 65   9/17  H&amp;S  4,798-2wo
propaganda material.   An example was a recent Times leader  on the food question,which was circulated broadcast through Germany.  Again, the rule is certain to excludespeculations on the philosophy and history of politics. , No doubt,  such speculations areoften extreme, and inconsistent with  the  views of His Majesty &apos;s  Government;  but aveto on their export  would be  regarded,  with  some reason,  as an attempt to stiflediscussion.  The nearer we approach to the end of the war the more difficult it will beto prevent people speculating on the future  and discussing political principles.  It willbe impossible to prevent this, and, even if it were possible, it is a question whether itwould  be  desirable.  If all countries became laboratories of Constitution-making,  itwould be  futile  to  attempt to veto  the  export  of  the British product^   Finally, thecranks of every country are now pretty well known,  and thsir value is discounted.   Afoolish speech by Mr. Snowden  is not going to hearten German opinion any more than agibe by Maximilian Harden will exhilarate British and French opinion.     9. The conclusion  seems to be that the  chances of enforcing an effective  embargoupon the export of current periodicals, once they have been published in  the  UnitedKingdom, are so slight as to make the attempt almost worthless.  Probably the onlyexception to this  generalization  is to  be found in  technical journals, in  which thecombination of letterpress with  diagrams and drawings is essential to the understandingof the subject  treated.   These  can be  dealt with as  at present.   In  other cases theattempt to prevent the offending publication from  reaching the enemy would merelygive it gratuitous advertisement.   So far, moreover, as the embargo is based upon theground that the publication may encourage the  enemy and  give - material for enemypropaganda, it  is based upon a principle which can  neither be seriously  defended norlogically applied.     10. On the whole, therefore, as  stated  in  paragraph 6, it is  proposed  to renouncefrankly the power to place an  embargo upon  the export of current periodicals  (otherthan technical journals) published in Britain on the grounds that, in most cases, it canhave no real effect, and at the  best  is  scarcely worth the trouble and delay which itentails.   If this view is taken, all restrictions upon  the export of such British pub-lications  should  be withdrawn (provided that they continue to be  sent  by licensedagents), and the  withdrawal should  be notified  in  as public a way  as possible, andput on the following grounds ; -    . [a.) After three years of war the Press  of  the United Kingdom, and writers upon           military  and  political subjects,  must  be  almost as  well aware  as the           Censorship  itself what it is unpatriotic  to  publish, as likely  to help the           enemy, to  hamper  the conduct  of the war, embroil  the  relations of the           Allies, and  produce an unfavourable impression upon neutrals.     (b.)  It is also fully realized that the mischief is done when once undesirable matter           is published in a  periodical regularly sent  abroad, for then in all proba-           bility it will reach the enemy, and will be turned to account by  him for his           own information, or for propaganda purposes.     (c.) The general  attitude and  the  line  of  action  of the  Press of  the United           Kingdom as a whole are such that it now appears practicable to place upon           its members the moral responsibility of deciding what they  will and will not           publish,  not only,  as hitherto,  from the  point  of view   of its effect  on           British  readers, but  also with  regard to its possible effect upon  neutrals           and  the use to which the enemy can turn it.     11. It is clear, however, that if, in the case of all such periodicals, the Governmentrenounces  the  power  of restricting  export,  this   renunciation  makes   it  all  themore incumbent upon  editors to weigh the value to the enemy of what they publish.In fairness to those editors who loj^ally comply with  this obligation, and in fulfilmentof its manifest  duty of securing  the public against  any abuse of its confidence, theGovernment cannot afford to divest itself of the powers which it possesses, to punishthose who  contravene  the Defence  of  the  Bealm Kegulations by publishing matterwhich ought not to be published.   If, therefore, any Government Department considersthata published statement is likely to injure the cause of the Allies, it should  com-municate at once with the Directors of the Press Bureau, who, at their discretion, canexplain to  the  editor  or writer responsible the manner in which the statement iscalculated  to  do  harm.  Warnings  so given are  not likely  to be   disregarded byresponsible persons.  If, however, objectionable matter is published after warning andin very flagrant cases without a previous warning-it should be made  known that theGovernment will not hesitate  to  prosecute  the  offender  or  suspend  the  publicationof   the  offending  print.    For   these  purposes   the  powers   given   by  the
 Defence  of the Realm -Regulations are  sufficient.   It will,  moreover,:  be  necessarj^ to apply-these  powers of prosecution  and suspension impartially against all seriously  offending papers within the United kingdom,-whatever their antecedents or political complexion.  The chief difficulty  might  arise in  Ireland, where, for some time past, highly seditious literature has been published with  impunity, though  its export has been banned.  This does not necessarily mean that a paper advocating the independence of Ireland or an Irish Republic should  be  suppressed; but  any publications which published accounts of British  &quot;atrocities,&quot;  and  gross  misrepresentations of  British policy and false news, must,  be dealt with as effectively in Ireland as in Great Britain, otherwise the above proposal obviously cannot&apos; be adopted.      12.  If the  course  recommended in paragraph  10  is adopted, the same procedure should be used as  was followed by the Foreign Office when it abandoned the Foreign Office Censorship, i.e., there should be an announcement to the  Press through  the Press Bureau of the Governments intentions, coupled with a warning that  the responsibility now lies upon the editors and publishers themselves, and at the same time  the Govern&apos; ment policy might be expounded at greater length in reply to an agreed question in the House of Commons.     13. A special  censorship  is necessary m certain other cases as well as in that of technical journals, for it might happen  that  a publication which is  harmless in this country may have a prejudicial effect in other parts of the Empire,  Mr. Arthur. Mee;s works, for example, which record crimes committed, or diseases contracted in this-country by soldiers under  the influence of drink, are.calculated, if published in the Dominions, to prejudice recruiting.  In  Canada  the authorities  do not permit their publication.   In such cases, at any rate where a military question is involved, it seems desirable that  the British  censorship should assist  the  Dominions authorities  by stopping the export of publications whose  circulation is forbidden in the country of destination.   Again, works dealing with Islamic problems, which are perfectly harmless in Britain, might do considerable harm in India or Egypt.  Occasions also arise where the Allies  ask  us to make a  use  of  the censorship which,  in the light of our own standards, might, be regarded  as  questionable.   Here, too, the Chief Postal  Censor might well be authorized at his discretion  to act as the agent of the Allied  Government concerned.    - &apos;     14.  To summarize,  if the policy recommended above is adopted :      (a.)  There  will be no attempt to prevent the export of current  issues of newspapers,            magazines, reviews, and other periodicals (technical  journals excepted).     (b.) Technical journals will be dealt with as at present.     (c.)  Books, pamphlets, and publications (other than technical journals and the cur-            rent issues of periodicals), will be judged, on their merits without regard to            the  previous &quot;record of-the writer of the publication.  This involves the-            revision of the present Black List of publications whose export is forbidden.     (d.) There  will be no veto on the honest  expression of political opinion,  unless it            takes the form of an active propaganda prejudicial to the Allied cause.     15.  The above remarks apply  solely to the export of printed matter, whether inthe form of newspaper, magazine, review, pamphlet or book.   They are not intended tohave any reference to the censorship  .of  outgoiiig  letters  and cables,  which is  notconsidered in this memorandum.                                      NOTE.     The above  memorandum which was prepared jointly by the War  Office.and theDepartment of Information, was issued in proof to the  Admiralty and the Home Officefor their  concurrence.     The Admiralty observe that they concur in the view that it is better, so far  as .periodicals other than technical are concerned, to prevent  the publication of objection-able matter rather than to rely on the exercise of the power to  prohibit the export  ofpublications which have been indiscreet.     The Admiralty recognize that under the present system  much undesirable mattermay be exported which should  not  be allowed to leave the country, but they  have nodoubt that the possibility of the export of a  paper  being prohibited must, in manycases, restrain editors from  allowing undesirable matter to appear in their publications.If it could be assumed that in the case of any  publication overstepping the boundary aprosecution  under the Defence  of the Realm Regulations would inevitably follow, theAdmiralty are prepared to agree that an adequate safeguard would be  afforded, but  ifthere is any doubt on the point it  appears  to  them questionable whether it would  be
desirable for His Majestys Government to abandon the power to  prohibit the export ofthe subsequent issues of the paper in any sufficiently flagrant case.    The Home Office observe that the occasions on which they have been consulted inthe manner stated in paragraph 2 of the Memorandum have been very few, and theyhave never understood that&apos;they would be consulted before any propagandist literaturewould be stopped.    The Home Office  mention  that,  in. the  case  of the  Nation,  they suggestedwarning the editor and were not further consulted when the decision to stop the paperwas taken.                                                                   -    The Home  Secretary goes  on  to  make  the  following   comments  on   theMemorandum: -    While the Home Office is not primarily concerned with the maintenance  of thepresent rule with regard to the  prohibition of export of printed  matter, it is concernedwith the censorship of publications in this country and  with the action taken againstnewspapers under the Defence of the Realm  Regulations ; and it is necessary to pointout that in proposing no longer  to interfere with the  export  of objectionable publica-tions, the  Memorandum puts  too  much reliance  on  the possibility  of suppressingobjectionable publications in this country.       .    In paragraph 1 it is stated  that  &quot;we have not adopted a scientific system of Presscontrol at home.&quot;   If by a &quot;scientific systemof Press control&quot; is  meant  a  completereview by the  Censor of all publications  in  this county, then  it  is true that no  suchcensorship  exists,  and any attempt  to&apos;establish such a censorship would be stronglyresisted.  All  submission of matter to the.  Censor is voluntary  on the part  of thepublishers.   The Censor cannot prevent  the publication of military or naval  secretsunless the article is voluntarily  submitted to him, and  any publisher -is  free to publishanything he thinks fit if he is prepared to take the risk of a prosecution. - If, therefore,it should be decided to announce that no veto will be  put on the export  of any news-paper, it should be clearly understood that the censorship cannot prevent the publicationin this country of matter, however dangerous, which is not submitted to it.    In paragraph  11 it is suggested that the publication of statements likely to beinjurious to the cause.of  the  Allies should be  prevented by  a  warning, and. if thewarning is disregarded, &quot;it should&apos;be made known that the Government will nothesitate to prosecute the offender or  suspend the publication of  the  offending print.For these purposes the powers given by the Defence of the Realm  Acts are sufficient.&apos;&quot;&apos;This statement implies a reliance on the  powers given by the  Defence of  the  RealmActs which does not appear to be justified.     1.  Prosecutions under the Defence of the Realm Regulations  are extremely difficult,and have more than once failed  in flagrant cases.  Moreover, when  the Home Office hasproposed to prosecute newspapers for statements likely to be mischievous in this country,or likely  if  sent  abroad  to form  a basis  for dangerous  enemy propaganda,  theGovernment  has  on  several  occasions  decided  that - the  prosecution  Avoukl  beinexpedient.    2.  There is no power to stop  the issue of a paper unless  there is reason to believethat it contains matter contravening the regulation, and, generally speaking, it  cannot,.be ascertained that a newspaper contains such matter until after  the  paper has beenissued, when suppression of the  issue can only be partial.     3.  There is no power &quot;to suspend the publication of an offending print.&quot;  There ispower  under the Militaiy  order to  seize the type and  other plant of any offendingnewspaper, and this has been done successfully in the case the Globe, and less success-fully in one or two other cases ;  but such seizure is not equivalent to suppression.  Thepaper can re-appear if another printer can be found to publish it,  as is  likely to be thecase when the paper in question is not an important newspaper with a large  circulation.    In paragraph  11 it is also suggested that warnings &quot; are not likely to be disregardedby  responsible  persons&quot;;   but  it ought not to be forgotten that some  of the mostmischievous statements which have  appeared, and the export of which has been so faras possible stopped, have been published by irresponsible persons on whom no warningwould  have the slightest effect.             -                                 ;     In the opinion of the Home. Secretary it is undesirable to make airy generalstatement of policy which  would tie the hands of the Government in  preventing theexport of matter likely to be useful  to  the enemy,  either by way of information or forpurposes of propaganda.   If such a pledge were given it might prevent  the stopping ofthe export of  important information and  of gross misstatements of facts which, wouldcertainly have been prohibited from publication in this country if they had come to thenotice of the Censor.  He suggests that it would be better to retain the  existing powersand to use  them with discretion.
CONFIDENTIAL.THE  CENSORSHIP ON  THE EXPORT OF PRINTED MATTER.    1. THE.question of the prohibition of  the export of matter printed and publishedin the United Kingdom is likely to raise so many intricate points in the future that it isimportant to come to a clear understanding of our policy.  The difficulty of the questionis that we have not adopted a scientific system of Press control at home.  There.is noobligation to submit printed matter to the  Press Bureau.   If  a book or a magazinecontains  objectionable material, the only remedy is action  under the Defence of theRealm Acts.    2. Our only real censorship of published matter is applied with regard  to export.The procedure &quot;is that the Postal Censors call the attention of the Director  of SpecialIntelligence  at the War Office to  any suspect publication/and the Director of SpecialIntelligence, when the matter is not military or naval, takes the opinion of the ForeignOffice and the Home  Office.  Any steps to prohibit export are  taken  on the respon-sibility of the military authorities.    3. This is obviously an  unsatisfactory  arrangement, for with  the  publication ofobjectionable material in this, country the harm is already done.  If any military ornaval  secrets are divulged we,may be fairly  certain that they find their way  at once tothe enemy&apos;s Intelligence Department, whether the export is forbidden or not.   Further,it produces hard cases, for a book or paper may be prevented from going abroad whichcontains  only  one  doubtful passage a passage  which could have  been struck  outbefore publication if a proper domestic censorship had existed.    4. The principles on which the veto on  export are founded  at present seem  to  bethree:     (a.)  That  the work contains  something objectionable  from a military or  naval          point of  view;    (6.)  That the work contains passages which  may prejudice His Majesty&apos;s Govern-          ment&apos;s relations with foreign Powers ;    (c.) That the work contains material likely to encourage the enemy or form a basis          for dangerous enemy propaganda.    5. With regard to (a) and (b) the principle is clear, though the  -practical efficiencyof the veto is  probably very small.   But with regard to (c), the principle, which waslaid down by Mr. Herbert Samuel when at the Home Office, in a letter of  28th August,1916, is itself doubtful.  It is a most difficult one to apply rightly and consistently witha reasonable amount of free expression of opinion.  Rigidly applied, it would rule outany criticism whatsoever of the British Government.   Again, the most innocent phrasecan be distorted by the enemy for  propagandist purposes.   There is  no paper  inBritain since the war began which could not be claimed as an offender on this ground.Most  of  the speeches  by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers, all. Parliamentary debates, all news-papers, and all the leading reviews, contain material which, adapted or unadapted, canbe used to encourage the enemy.    6. At the present stage of the war the application of this principle is likely to domore harm than good.  In the first place, the entry of America as an Ally makes a realdifference.   America, with her strong  belief in  the  free expression of  opinion, willresent any attempt  to spoon-feed her  as to the export of literature, except on verydefinite  and defensible grounds.  But these grounds  are hard to find, for the rulecannot be applied fairly.  An article  may be written with an honest purpose, and maybe of real value for British opinion, and at the same time be seized upon by the enemyas good propaganda material.   An example was a recent &quot; Times &quot; leader on the Foodquestion, which was circulated broadcast through Germany.  Again, the rule is certainto exclude speculations on the philosophy  and history of politics.  No doubt, suchspeculations are often extreme, and  inconsistent with the views of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment;  but a veto on their  export would  be regarded, with some reason, as anattempt to stifle discussion.  The  nearer we approach the  end of the war the  more      [721]
difficult it will be to prevent people speculating - on the future and discussing politicalprinciples.  It will be impossible to prevent this, and, even if it were possible, it is aquestion whether  it would be  desirable.   If  all countries  become  laboratories  ofConstitution-making, it would be futile to attempt to veto the export of the Britishproduct.  Finally, the cranks of every country are now pretty well known, and theirvalue is discounted.  A foolish speech by Mr. Snowden is not going to hearten Germanopinion, any  more than  a gibe by Maximilian Harden will exhilarate  British andFrench opinion.     7.&apos; The conclusion seems to be that the chances of enforcing an effective embargoupon the  export -of printed matter which has already been  published in the UnitedKingdom  are so  slight as to make the attempt  almost worthless ;  that in most casesthe attempt would merely give  gratuitous advertisement to the offending publication ;and that, so far as the embargo is based upon  the  ground that the publication mayencourage  the enemy and  give  material for enemy propaganda, it is based upon aprinciple which can neither be seriously defended nor logically applied.     8. Two changes might be effected in our practice-one comparatively trifling andthe other on a wider basis.   The FIRST would be to  abandon principle (c) altogether,and as regards (a) and  (b),  with the concurrence  of the War Office and the Admiralty,to instruct the Postal  Censors  to  take a less stringent line  henceforth in censoringundesirable statements for example, those useful for enemy propaganda, &amp;c.  Thisrelaxation would no doubt have the effect of getting rid of a certain amount of frictionand irritation which now exists, and would slowly, perhaps, but surely put His MajestysGovernment in a somewhat stronger position.     9. The SECOND method is to recognise frankly that an embargo upon  the exportof matter published in Britain can in most cases have no real effect, and at the best isscarcely worth the trouble and  delay which  it entails.  If this  view  is taken, allrestrictions upon the export of British publications should be withdrawn (provided thatthey are still sent by licensed agents), and the withdrawal should be notified in as publica way as possible, and put on the following grounds :      (a.) After nearly three years of war the greater  part of  the Press of the United           Kingdom and writers upon military and political subjects are almost  as           well aware as the Censorship itself of what it is unpatriotic to publish, as           likely to help the enemy, to hamper the conduct  of the war,  embroil the           relations  of the Allies, and produce an unfavourable  impression  upon           neutrals.     (b.) It is also  fully realised  that when once undesirable matter is published the           mischief is done, for then  in all probability it will reach  the  enemy and           will be turned to account by him for his own information, or for propaganda           purposes.     (c.) The general  attitude  and  the line of action  of  the Press of the United           Kingdom as a whole are such that it seems wiser as well as more generous           to place upon its members the responsibility of deciding what they will           and will not publish.     (d.) In cases of doubt a  patriotic editor can  apply for. guidance to the  Press           Bureau, who will take immediate steps to ascertain  from the Department           especially concerned whether or not there are  any objections to publication.     10. It is clear, however, that the Government cannot afford to divest itself of thepowers which it possesses under the Defence of the Realm Acts for securing the publicsafety against wrongful publications.   If,  therefore, any  Government  Departmentdiscovers  that a  published statement has injured the  cause of  the  Allies, it shouldcommunicate at once, through some central authority,  like the Press Bureau, appointedfor the purpose, with the editor or  writer responsible,  and explain to him  the  mannerin  which  the statement  has done  harm.  Warnings so given  are not  likely to bedisregarded by responsible persons.   If, however, objectionable matter  is publishedafter warning-and in very flagrant cases without a  previous warning it should bemade known that the  Government  will   not  hesitate  to exercise  its  powers  bysuppressing the issue or temporarily or permanently suspending the publication of theoffending print.   For this purpose the  powers given by the Defence  of the Realm Actsare sufficient. It will  be open to the  proprietors of the suppressed publication to suelor damages, but no jury is likely to award  more  than nominal  damages in such acase, especially if previous warnings are proved against the plaintiff.     11. If this  line of  action  is  adopted, and all  restrictions  upon the  export ofpublications  removed,  it will be necessary to apply  the powers of suppression and
 suspension given ,by the Defence of  the  Realm Acts impartially against  all seriously offending papers within the United  Kingdom, whatever  their antecedents or political complexion.  .The chief difficulty niight arise in Ireland, where, for  some  time  past, highly seditious literature has been published with impnnity, though its export has been banned.  This does not mean that  a  paper advocating  the  independence of Ireland or an Irish Republic  should be  suppressed ; but any Irish publication which published accounts of British &quot; atrocities,&quot; and gross misrepresentations  of British policy and false news must be dealt with summarily in Ireland  as in Great Britain, otherwise the above proposal obviously cannot be adopted.     12. Of  the two courses of action outlined in paragraphs 8 and 9 the second and bolder is  recommended, both as being more defensible  logically, and simpler to execute, and as likely to-appeal  to the whole Allied and neutral press as a generous policy.     13. If  the course recommended is adopted, the same procedure should be used as was followed by  the Foreign Office when it abandoned the Foreign Office Censorship, i.e., there should be an announcement to the press  through the  Press Bureau of the Governments intentions, coupled with a  warning that the responsibility now lies upon the editors  and publishers themselves, and at  the  same time the Government policy might be expounded at greater length in reply  to an agreed question in the House of. Commons.     14. The above remarks apply solely to the export of printed matter, whether in the form of newspaper, magazine, review, pamphlet, or. book.  They  are not intendedto have any reference to the censorship  of  out-going letters and cables, which is notconsidered in this memorandum.
