Ourjustification for &quot;marking time&quot; hitherto ??as that we had  reasonto doubt whether anything we sent them would be put to the usefor which it was intended,       A letter.from General Hermonius, dated 9th July,  and SirGeorge Buchanan&apos;s.telegram from Petrograd, No, 1035,  (both annexed)raise the whole Question of the present position Of the  programmewhich was agreed upon between the Allies at the Petrograd  Con-ference in February last,   .1 submit below a &quot;summary  of  thesituation as. it stands to*day under the following heads.7            (1)    Tonnage            (8)    Guns  \            (o)    Aeroplanes            (4)    Coal &apos;  -                       ::        :      -: &apos;      The gravity of the situation is pointed out by  General-Hermonius where he;intimates that short age of tonnage allocated  vmay,involve a  &quot;Sad modification of the whole Russian  plan  ofcampaign&quot;while the I reduction of, the co al 0 auses him to add&apos; thatthe output of the Russian State;Factories and national War Indus-tries are;threatened with the gravest consequences. :      It would seem that the continuance of the new Russianoffensive requires the reconsideration of the whole Russianprogramme; as affected by decisions arrived at beiore  the offensivebegan,                        .-;;::.;v;                  &apos;  .     V   &apos;  &apos;                      (1)   TONNAGE,   ;;.; - There is now three months left before the. Port  of  Archangelcloses,-and any material alteration in the allocation must bemade at  once.   On the 28th June, I wrote a letter to GeneralHermonius, stating that the Shipping Controller could only allotapproximately 150,000 tons for shipments from this country, insteadof the 456,000 tons previously intended.  General Hermonius hasendeavoured to reduce the Russian programme to the barest  minimum,i?n  as  sketched  a programme requiring SOS,000 tons instead of the-lou,UOO  tons at present allocated.   This programme shows  a billing-thfL0?  tile^aTt  of the Russians  (however regretfully) to  reducetneir demands by more than half.   I think it would be well to givethem the  additional 58,000 tons if it is not possible to eoueeze the
the 208.000 tons into the ships already allotted, -       Besides the tonnage allocated to;.shipments from thiscountry,  there is an even graver redaction^in prospect of thepossible  shipments from France and America.   At this momentt^ere are in France 100,000 tons of material ready for shipment.The Shipping Controller has only given six/ships during July andAugust.  No French ships are available in July, but 15 ships willbecome available in August.       In the United States 500,000 tons are waiting shipment.Slightly over 50,000 tons of shipping is available for July.

Lord Milner.                     9th July,  1917..   : Offices of the War Cabinet,      2, WHITEHALL GARMNS, S .W.I. Dear Lord Milner,    .             .  -               .      .  I have  received your letter of  June 28th,  and have  forwarded to my Government your latest decisions  contained in  it with regard to the  tonnage  placed at the disposal  of ,the  Russian Government between July 1st and October 1st of this  year. -        In view of the contents of  your letter,  the  Russian Govern- ment Committee  has effected a -total readjustment of  its shipping programme for that period, as far a3 shipments from  this  country are  concerned.  We have.taken into  earnest consideration  the  extreme shortage of.tonnage, and have, made  every  attempt to  reduce  our shipment.  As..stated on the enclosedlist, we  would request  208,260 tons of shipment from this country,  as:against 456?000 tens previ- ously intended. . This:.figure- is somewhat  higher than that intimated in your letter, viz., 150,000 tens,  but on taking  into account the varied  natures  of .our.cargoes,  I am in  hopes  that, by arranging combined shipments of heavy and light  cargoes, we  shall be  able to export  the whole of these 208,260&apos; tons  on the 24 steamers allocated to us. &apos; .     .  . .   .   .-  .                  - &quot;&apos;        I would  like to point out that  the curtailed  programme we now  attach represents the extreme minimum,&apos;;.&apos;and is  f ar from  meeting - actual  Russian  requirements/ I therefore venture  to request  that, if the  least possibility arise,&apos; v/o  should&apos; be  given the benefit of any  available increase of tonnage.        I Tvculd further point out that  the reduction by 50  per-cent in the  tonnage  allocated to the transport of  coal  threatens the output  of our State factories,and national war industries with the  gravest consequences at, the same time bearing  heavily en  our Navy and Mercantile Marine.  In. this matter I am unable to  take any  personal responsibilits^, and I  have put the  whole question before&apos;my Government in petrograd,-of whose views  I  shall inform you  .as  scon as  I receive them.  .        Your decisions with.regard  to  the Russian  tonnage from America and Prance make the situation&apos;critical,  as cur programme of shipments, especially from America^  is so  far upset by them that I  seriously fear we shall be faced,&apos; as  an ultimate consequence,  by a  sad modification of cur whole plan of campaign on  the Russian front.               .;/-::^.&apos;;/&apos;v    V    &apos; V-        -        In view of this danger, I would consider it  essential that a  conference, should be held,  to be  attended by plenipotentiaries of all  the Allied Governments,  at which the distribution  to the Allies  of all available tonnage-should  be thoroughly revised,  with a  view to the  successful conduct of the War on all the fronts.        I should be grateful if you would give this  matter  your most serious  attention, and would/favour me  with  an&apos; early  reply..      -  : .   -                            Yours etc,(Sgd.)   E.
