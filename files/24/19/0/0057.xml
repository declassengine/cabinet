The War Cabinet discussed the. question  :.of /communicating Imperial&apos;,War. Cabinetdocuments/to the  Prime Minister of- the Australian Common-;woalth  (Paper -G^T^^I) (Appendix,III).    -    The  Secretary of State for;the Golonies pointed out that; the &quot;other Prime Ministers had each taken away a set of the papers supplied, to them during the Session of the Imperial War Cabinet&quot;taking special precautions for their-destruction in case Of emergency^  Mr, Hughes was therefore; in a position, relative to Prime Ministers, of complete ignorance as to-the. Imperial situation,- as, it had been before those Mihisters.  This might possibly be awkward if Mr.  Massey visited Mr.  Hughos on his returnIflHBMMllllWIIIIIIMiilllWMWIMIIMIIIIffl^     &apos;i

If Mr. Hughes wore coming over soon he could SCO tho papers here, &quot;but his plans were uncertain, and if he were not coming over he might be offended if ho did not; receive tho -   . papers..  The..Secretary of.State for tho Colonies had some doubts whether  a&quot;Prime Minister who was absent from tho  Cabinet Session should have the papers circulated     .:;/: to him, and, in yiow of the fact  that the Imperial Cabinet was being established as a -; permanent Institution, that point would have to be considered.  After some hesitation, in view of the possible risks run, he had been prepared to suggest sroriling the documents out in charge of a special messengor.     A general discussion followed^ chiefly as to the extent of risk incurred in sending the. documents oversea.     Tho War Cabinet instructed:-     .The Secretary of  State for the Colonies        -to. send a telegram to the Prime      v; Minister-of the Australian Common-        wealth expressing the view ox the War      ,: .
