of One-Han Businesses.   Protected Industries &amp;e.I have discussed with the Secretary of State forWar the case which has teen frequently raised in Parliamentof the talcing for the Army of men who  are the  sole heads tt&quot;businesses which depend upon them for their continuance andin their absence will probably ctllapse.Many instances of hardship have been alleged andthere is no doubt a growing feeling of grievance.  This isparticularly the case where these owners of snail businesseshave -put all: the savings of years into the business,  wherethey are nearer forty than thirty years of age,  where the,business is the sole means of supporting wife and children,and where nobody.else can carry it on while it,can only bedisposed of at a ruinous loss.   The Military Service  Actallows exemption on grounds of special hardship and it must,of course, be recognised that as the need cf the Army formen becomes greater, the standard of hardship&apos;which wouldjustify exemption must be raised.number, of instances ssiongst the Tribunals,  due to  the  fact   .&apos;-&quot;; being so Beverely drained,  while the much larger reservoir      of men in. protected industriesfor whose exemption the    /Tribunals have no responsibility is not in their opinion :      adequately drawn upoft, &apos;              ... -I am receiving many protests from Tribunals.   The      protests refer especially to men in munition works and in      mines; but mention is made also of other protected industries.The particular grievance is only one phase of thegeneral feeling of dissatisfaction which exists among thepublic/generally and it has found its expression  in  athat.,the reservoir of nen who. come before  the  Tribunals: is
          The protests extend to agriculture.  I have justreceived from one of my Inspectors a report of a conferencerecently&apos;called hy the County Agricultural Executive Committeefor Lincolnshire (Parts of Holland) and attended by members ofTribunals, at which strong protests were made against therecent direction that agricultural workers are not to be calledup if the Agricultural Executive Committees claim their feten-tion.  Tribunals point out that, especially in this district,from their very membership tiiey are well acquainted with theneeds of agriculture, and the exceedingly prosperous conditionof agriculture in the district shows that they have notneglected its claims.  They protest against the right beinggiven to one of the interests concerned to say whether or notmen shall be released for the Army.  There appears also tohave been some feeling that the system gives the farmingcommunity the means of exploiting the necessities of thecountry for their own profit.          It is, however, against the continued exemption ofyoung men in munition works and in mines that the feeling isstrongest; and I do feel that, unless clear and definiteaction is taken (though not necessarily for supplying men forthis year&apos;s operations), grave difficulties may arise in thecountry.  The arrangements for granting protection certificatesdo not appear to be working well;  and I am receiving manyprotests.          In parts of South Wales particularly,  the publicfeeling is acute.   Some Tribunals,  in view of the prevailingresentment,  are refraining from dealing with the cases ofelderly married men pending some clear indication of whataction is proposed by the Government.   Though I  cannotacquiesce in any measures which delay dealing with cases,    cjI :oanno&quot;t but feel that the action of the Tribunals is notwithout some justification.;  In - the tin-plate districts the
position has been rendered worse by the fact that many tin-plate workers who are on slack time are being kept from theArmy because they are enrolled as Army Reserve MunitionWorkers, without, however, being employed as such.         . The Tribunals know well what are the conditionsin their localities.  They are convinced that many of theyoung men who are now protected are not indispensablebecause of skill and certainly are not required for thepresent amount of work, because many of them are workingslack time.  At the same time, the Tribunals have beenconsistently pressed, in view of the urgent need cf men forthe Army, to adopt very strict standards in deciding whethermen.are.to be granted exemption.   They have responded loyallybut they, and still more the general public, are beginningto resent the necessity of sending elderly men into the Armywhile young men, much fitter for soldiering and with manyless responsibilities are being,  as appears to them,unnecessarily protected.  .          I cannot but feel that  the adoption of a simplerule under which no protection should be given to men belowa certain limited age provided they are fit for service,would not only allay dissatisfaction but would also bewelcomed as a reasonable and logical method of supplyingthe needs of the Army.  I hope that this matter may receivethe prompt consideration of the Far Cabinet.          The case of the &quot;one-man business&quot; man who  istaken for the Army and whose business consequently collapsesseems to call for some special treatment after the War.   Itwill be very much to the interest of the nation to securethe re-establishment of businesses great and small a,srapidly as possible, and it v\rould not be unreasonable tohelp those small traders to get on their feet again withoutdelay and recover their good-will among their neighbours.
 Some of these men:will no:doubt secure assistance from the Civil liabilities Comaittee on joining the Array;   11  is, ; I think,  recognised that the asaistance given by  that Coiazaittee must be continued for a short time,  six or twelve months after the war,   Per  those men  whose businesses have collapsed,  whether or not  they have previously received assistance from the Civil Liabilities Coamittee, some provision,  either  by way of  free  grant or by.cheap loan or by both, should,  I  think, be made te enable them to re-establish their: businesses,  and I would recommend that it should be made through the machinery of the Civil Liabilities Cocmittee.   I  would, however, emphasise the fact  that the majority  of these  men are  of mature ago, they are  expensive to maintain as  soldiers and they will be: costly to reinstate, while  from a  military point  of view they are  leac efficient than younger men.                  :7y/:;; /v&apos;/   y.
