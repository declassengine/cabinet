   Foreign.  Secret.226 F. of 3rd July.views and  we find            -From Viceroy. Foreign Department, 5th July 1917.                     (Repeated to Teheran, as 773 S.)      -                           (Received 7 a.m. 6th.)                    Persia. .  Reference  to Minister  &apos;at Teh.eran&apos;s telegram                    Marling appears to have completely misunderstood  our                   it  difficult to understand  liis.  But  this is no time forbandying words.  All we desire is to co-operate fully and loyally in whatevercourse His Majesty&apos;s Government consider best calculated.to avert very seriouspossibilities indicated in. our telegram of the 25th June last.  From Marling&apos;stelegrams 198 F., 207 F. and 212 F. we gather that present  -Persian Cabinetis tottering, that it may at any moment be succeeded by a purely democraticGovernment or worse still by general anarchy while in local  democrat circlesthere is  much boasting that  (? of)  fresh Turkish attempt  on Persia^  Ourtelegram  of the 25th June last was  an  attempt  to suggest a constructivepolicy to meet this  situation  and  its consequences  and we still  think thatpolicy preferable  to  the alternative of  &quot; Persian  neutrality .19.15,  viz.,..official passivity with unofficial assistance to enemy.&quot;  Marling in  assumingthat so long as our  position at  Baghdad  is secure,  oil  fields  will not beattacked  fails  apparently to realise that anarchy in  Persia.au open roadsouthwards.for the Turks not  only  turning  our Baghdad position, but alsomenacing Maude&apos;s communications and base to such an extent as to threatenseriously our hold on Mesopotamia and thus require additional force to  saynothing of  cramping  Maude&apos;s  freedom  of action.   You  are already inpossession of  our  views as to possible result in Afghanistan.   We are con-vinced only way to&apos; check  anarchy  is to conciliate really strong  democratsand  help  them to establish a working  Government and that adherence toa reactionary policy may lead to very serious consequences.
