S B C R E T.G.T. 1396.WAR CABINET.MAN POWER.(1)Sir Maurice Hankey.      In the attached memorandum,  I have attempted to give ageneral review of the question of  Manpower as it has presentedit3elf to the War Cabinet.  The subject is one of the utmostdifficulty, as events have not followed one another in anyordered sequence, and the history  of the problem does not fallinto any clearly defined periods.   No-one except Mr. Young canclaim to be qualified to write an   exhaustive treatise on thesubject *  Mr. Bevan,  has,  however,  taken a good deal oftrouble to collect material,  and I hope the memorandum may beuseful as a guide to our contemporaries and a warning to thosewho come after us.12th  July,  1917.                          (Sgd.)  G.K. HODGSON.       This valuable summary should be  circulated to  tb*r WarCabinet and all officers concerned in Man-Power.(2)(Sgd.)  M.P.A. HANKEY.14th. July,  1917.
fNOTES .. ON THE MANPOWER- PROBLEM.REVIEW QP TEE SUBJECT SlllOE THE FORMATION OP THE                 WAR CABINET&quot;. -  &quot;2.   Introductory.; &quot;       When first the War Cabinet&apos; was  formed,  the  question of: Man-   power was oloseiy engaging public attention.&quot;  , The Manpower Dis-   txibutioh Board had &quot;been  formed :and the  National Service Depart-   ment was foreshadowed.       On  the 14th fcecemher,. 1916,  ihe War  Cabinsi decided to.   appoint i B^reotor-Oeneral of  National Servlc^i(W.0.7(D)and   on the  same  day it was decided that the  Manpower Distribution   Board should continue its fauctions,  pending the distribution   of -its  responsibilities between  the Director-General of National   Service and  the Ministry  of  Laboti&apos;, iWb&apos;J-l/(4) n   On tho 19th   December, it was decided  to  ask  lfcNev:Qle  .Ghakborlai?.v-to aecept   appointment  (W.d.ll(l)).   The Manpower  Distribution Boa:*d oon-   tinned  to exist until the 10th Jaima&quot;y;: when: the War Cabinet   authorised the transfer of Its functions to the Director-General   of National,Seryice  (W,0.51(15),3.     It: is difficult to give a connected account of the subsequent   dealings of  the War C abinet  with the s rb$ set of Menpo wer cw ing   to the  fact  that events have not followed, one  another in any1.   ordered sequence,  and the history cf the pre oil em does rot fall   into any well-defined periods.   The principal landmarks are.:-       Ill  The  Pirst  and Second Reports of  the Direotor-General of           National Service,       (3)  The  Report of  the Rhondda Committee.       (S). The  various demands  on Manpower  that have arisen, and   ;  ;      suggested  additional sources of  supply.      In the following notes, the subject has  been grouped round   these.landmarks and events arranged in chronological order,&apos;   &apos;  A.  FlRStS S^COirD REPORTS OP-THE DIRECTOR GENERAL&apos; OP                       NATIONAL SERVICE.  -I. /The first Report of the Director General.     dated 13th January 1917       was considered, by the War Cabinet on the 19th January (W..C.c&quot;9),&apos;  &apos;       The main recommendation of the Director was that all men aged     -  18^32 should be made available for military service.   3.    The War Cabinet decided:- &apos;     (a)  To release the following General Service men by the end of        :-- January:-; -r.,  :              : &apos; 30,000 from agriculture%   - &apos;          .   -. 30,000   w - mining- :                     50,000   &quot;munitions   &apos;                     A further number from railways - to  ba settled                       by the President of the Board of Trade.
       (b)  Also to release all men aged 18-22.except men            employed on production of steel, those covered            by the Trade Card Scheme,-. and men engaged inI,           agriculture,mines and quarries,railway shops,            transport work or shipyards:.       (c)  Also to direct that Tribunals should raise the            minimum, age for exemptions to 31, save in excep-            tional cases:       (d)  Also to authorise the A.G. to proceed with his         v -  proposal to call up boys . of 18 years of age. 3.    On 22nd. January, tbe.&apos;^ar Cabinet authorised the release of two divisions of tb e Home -. Pe fence Force for service abroad and took full responsibility for the results of this transfer. (**.C.40h  - &apos;     &quot; - 4V. -  The Second1 Report of the Director General of National Service. dated 3rd. February, 1917, was considered by the 7ar Cabinet on 5th. February, f-&apos;r.C,55),. In this it was pointed out that the number of men obtainable&apos; under-.2(b) above, was negligible* the fruitful:sourc Of supply were excluded.  The director urged the abolition of all exemptions up to 31, and the calling up of men by age groups..  The, War Cabinet adhered to their previous decision. 5.    The Home Secretary was instructed to draft a Bill for W&amp;r review of all tribunal exemptions held by men under 31, and the    . War Office undertook to prepare an estimate of the men who might, .-. become available if the Bill became law. (&apos;?,C,55).  The proposed review of exemptions was dropped an the 13th,February,owing:to the fact- that the War Office estimate (&quot;possibly 25,000&quot;), was &apos;. discouraging; (,.7.C.64i. 6. ;   Oh the  13th.. February, \ friC.64), Dr. Addison called attention to the ef f ect on output of the decision to release 50,000 men from n&amp;nitions 2 (a) .above.,  The difficulty was adjuster later by  . agreement with the War.Office  (*?.C.76.11). . 7.    A, Committee consisting of Lord Derby, lord Rhondda., Dr.  Addis on Mr. Hodge,  and Mr. N.Chamberlaint was appointed (13th,Feb.&quot;.C. 64), to consider the effect of the. decisions taken and to inform&apos; Sir D, Haig.  The maximum number of men. for general service estimated to; be obtained :by. the ^&apos;ar Cabinet decisions In respect of men up to-23 was ,50,000:  ( G.T.61.. 34th.Feb),&apos;  ..

Industries..   They consid- ered that to  take this, number  would endanger the  supply of essential needs and recommended that only 250,000 should be  released during the four-months in question,^   -\*ht Committee,                                                &apos;        %)  Reported against, industrial compulsion  (with several            dissentients).
f            (fc)   Reported&apos; against  raising the  age limit,  as urged               by the  Army Council,  on the ground that it was               industrial compulsion in disguise.            (o)   Recommended that  the Trade Card Scheme he               superseded &quot;by a Schedule of Occupations.            (d)   Recommended extension of liability to military               service of friendly aliens..         &apos;   -(e)   Recommended various minor amendments in Mill--&apos;               tary Service Aets including reduction of period               of grace allowed after expiry of exemption and.               power to re-examine rejected and discharged.          .  (f)   Recommended release of following quotas from             .  protected Industries               Badged men (except  shipbuilding)   124,000            V -Coal Mines,           -             55,000            &apos;  - Railways..  - i- -     -     ..-        :  21,000.

(g)   Recommended the greatest economy in the use            v   of Man-power, not only in civil industries, but               in the Army. .11..    In general the 7,&apos;ar Cabinet  approved the Report (-;..C. 103)..   They approved recommendations (a) and (c),  regarding indusr   trial compulsion, and the supersession of the Trade Card   Scheme.    They instructed the Foreign Office to ascertain the   views of the Russian Government as to the position of friendly   aliens it.)   (w,.0.108&quot;App. I).   They approved the clause of   the Bill (e) put forward by the Committee,  dealing with medi-   cal examination, but otherwise did not accept the Bill,   (o.C.108 App. I), and they approved the quotas suggested   (G.T.336) except as regards, miners.   This was fixed at 20,000   to be released by the end of July, in addition to the 20,000   already ordered to be released (2 (a) above) - i..e. a reduc-   tion from 55,000 to 20,000. : In return, the Coal Controller   was to release as mgjqjr men as possible for Iron-stone mining   and timber cutting.  At the same time the Schedule of Pro-   tectod Occupations was amended, so as to give absolute pro-   teetion to  man engaged in Shipbuilding and repairing and marine   engineering.   Dr. Addison placed it on record that this amend-   ment might  render it impossible to release the 124,000 men from   munitions.12.    Unfortunately., protracted negotiations with Trade Unions   were found to be necessary before the new Schedule could be   put into operation, and a further amendment was found necessary   viz.: that all male ndiluted labour&quot; should be taken before any
     apprentices or. Bkilled men engaged in muaii^ris. in any given &quot;Area(were recruited.   (The result of this pledge  hasWen to maice it     impossible to recruit any munitions workers  except ^dilutees&quot;     aged 18 - 32.   The Schedule is limited to men under 32;  and the    . dilutees aged 32 -: 41 at; present f^rm a  protective harrier to the    - apprentices or skilled men:aged lo - 32.   It is not anticipated     that more than 18,000 men will have been released from munitions     works &quot;by the end of July,  instead of the 124,000 desired.)*3*       The Schedule of Protected Occupations could not be brought into     operation before May 7th.  (W.C. 127) &quot;14.       With reference  to a question down for answer in the House of     Lords, it was decided to  point out that owing to opposition to  -   the withdrawal of the Trade  Card Scheme and  to labour troubles,     the numbers required, though they would be forthcoming, would not     be available by 1st. July. (W.C.138 (8) l^th. Hay).3.   SUPPLY Off ;AKD HSJI/^LS FOR MA1TP0!?]J1H.15.       Apart from the  decisions taken on the first two Reports of the     Director General of National Service and the Report of the Rhon-     dda Committee, the  War Cabinet has taken action from time to time     with a view to:-       -  .         (l) increasing  directly or indirectly the available supply     r:7;   ... of men for  the Army.         (2) meeting special demands for labour for certain essen-             tial. Industries.         The former can  mostyrBadily be summarised according to the    : sources on which it was proposed to draw, the latter according     to the industries it was proposed to re-inforce.16.   ADDITIONAL SQgRCSS  OF ISAKPOWER.   ]     by the employment of which men might be set  free for the Army:-         (a) Men engaged in the liquor trade,  to  be released by             State control (W.C.  33 (3) and  42 (App.l)         (b) Men resident in the Dominions (W.C40 (14) &amp; Imperial             W.C.6 (considered bvjt result unknown.)&apos;  &apos;         (c) Men to be set free by a rdduction of the strength of             divisions.  (W.C 55 v3) Rejected by  W.0 in Memo dated  -             10th. Feb.  1917.)  .         (d) Prisoners of War,  to Ve brought from France and replaced             by coloured or Turkish labour (W.C  107 App II not    &apos;           \Y: recommended,) X..         (e) Deserters in Schleswig Hoistein tobe transferred from          ;   Holland. (W.C. 117 (13).  Not worth  risk.)         (f) Austrian prisoners to be transferred from Italy           /  (W.C. 1^0 (-22).; Lord Derby &amp; Lord Newton to decide.)/         (g) Chinese and Indian Labour.
17.  Of the above (g) seems by far the most promising.  It wasfirst decided to continue recruiting in. China and stop it inIni^k (W.C. 150 (SSI).)  Later, when it was found that transportfrom India could be arranged, it was left to Lord Derby to decidewhether Chinese could be dispensed with and replaced by Indians:if so, whether British labour and prisoner labour in France canbe set free for work in England by the employment of Indians inPrance (W.C. 172.5).  There appear to be possibilities of develop-ing.. the recruitment of Indians (Imperial W.C.6).18.SPECIAL&apos; 3TEPS TO MSET MMDS EOH .:IABQQB have been made by theWar Cabinet In the case&quot;Iff the follo^-ngl^naustries:-      (a) Agriculture.          (i) 30,00^ General Service men to be withdrawn from          agriculture. (v/.C.l (a) 19th, Jan ) and the Army to          supply 30,000 substitutes - 15,000 from Home Defence          Porcesand 15,000 from other units.  (The latter 15,000          were not tmmediately forthcoming).  Special steps were          to be taken to divert gardeners to agriculture and to          obtain a sufficient supply of female labour.          (ii) 80,000 additional agriculturalists to be provided          W.C, 145 (9), 169 (15) and 171 (1),  )  The Army is to          provide 50,000 in ten weeks from 1st week in July;          and the agriculturalists now available, including men          lent by the Army,  are to be retained for agriculture *   :       No wholetime agricultural workers to be taken without          theconsent of the County Agricultural Committees.       (b)   Shipbuilding.           Specially exempted  from recruiting  (W.C.  39  (1)  (g)  (i)           and 108  (1).  )  since  January.   Some 90,000 additional           men will shortly be required  (   .0.125  (9).  )  for           shipbuilding.  (The  establishment  of a universal  system           of payment by results and  the formation of mobile labour           battalions might diminish  this  demand.  To the first           proposal,  three Important  Unions  - The  Ironfouuders*           Society,  the Operative  Plumbers1  Society  and the Amalgam,           ated Society of Carpenters and  Joiners  -  are utterly           opposed.   The second proposal was rejected by  the late           Third Sea Lord but  has n-ow been submitted to Sir Eric           Geddes.  .  -    -       (c)   Timber  Cutting.           Extra men are needed before the Import  of timber c:n           be prohibited.  Canada  and Newfoundland have supplied           lumber men, and miners have been  released for timber-           cutting.   A bonus is paid  to soldiers who are engaged on           this work. (W.C127  (21.) Protection from  recruiting is           required for timber-cutters, and 5,000  additional men           are; needed from the Army for two or three months (G.T.           1262).       (d)  Iron Stone Miningn           Extra men  ware &quot;needed in order  to. Increase home pro&amp;uc-           tions and thus save tonnage. 12,000 men at least were           wanted (W.C..87  (10),) Presumably they have no^ been           obtained,  as Dr. Aci&amp;ison does not refer to shortage of           labour in  his report on the subject (G.T.  1206).  Men have           bean released for this work from the coal mines and also           from the;Army. TJ* OTHER  ASPECTS OP TEE MB PO^BR PROBLEM..19.    Will the entry of America into the War,  by increasing thesupply of  troops reduce the demands in British man-power?  At -present it is too  early to give any reply to this  question.
Co.   A.second  division of Portuguese troops has been sent to France. Will  this set men free for agriculture, shipbuilding etc;t- In this country? 21.   What is the effect of the work of the national Service Department in :&apos;              (i) enrolling 3J5P,000 volunteers           .   f ii)re sir icting employment in non-essential industries            - (iiilcreating a. pbol of labour for essential trades by             drawing on the ie^s essential?.                       :;. In his tenth Report the Director General states that his substitutes are not wanted, and, apart; from agricultural work, his  department  is simply marking time.  In the opinion of the JLabour Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions, the national Service substitutes are not likely to be wanted for months to come; owing to the disappointing results1 of the  Schedule of Protected Occupations.
