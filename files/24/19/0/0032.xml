    (Copy of let-ter from Chief JOlYloeis &quot;London-Fire Brigade/   to Secretary, Tar Cubinety.                                    LONDON FIRE BRIGADE,                           -             Head  Quarters,                                          Bouthwark  Bridge-Road,                                                   S. E.                                          9th July 1917. Sir    *The raid &quot;by enemy aircraft  on London  which took  place on the 7th inet,, has established the  fact that  such airoraft  can come. over the centre of the metropolis during  daytime  and choose their objective with some precision.   Hitherto the contrary  has, in some quarters been assumed,.    The London Fire Brigade, under the  London County CCuncII, has the duty oast upon it by Act of Parliament  of providing the necessary organisation and  appliances for the protection from  fire of an area of  117 square miles, whic-a Contains Insured property to the extent of  some twelve hundred million  pounds in  addition to uninsured values represented by Government establishments  and  stores, besides the uninsured properties of railway companies and other large publie corporations...  A vary large proportion of  the values are contained in  a small area of perhaps four square  miles  adjacent to the City of  London which itself has an  area of a little over  one square mile, and this is the objective to which the  enemy  seem to direct their. attacks.    Even in pease  times the warehouse  area referred  to.is considered a serious conflagration risk,  as is judged  by the insurance premiums imposed by the Fire Offices, in view o-f the narrow.and tortuous thoroughfares and passages by which it  is intersected,  and the number of v/indow  openings fronting on to  lighting courts and wells in  the rear of promisee which  facilitate  the  spread  of fire from   &apos;. one building to another;  indeed, it is believed that there is no other large town  In Europe where the risk of  the e$$*g&amp; of fire is so  great, and certainly &quot;there  is no such  aggregation of valueB in any other European city.    The risks which were apprehended In  peace  times have without question been indefinitely extended by  the  liability of attack by enemy airoraft.    Although the London Fire Brigade is  short  of  its  pre-war establish meat of 1555 men  by 315 men, the effect of  this  reduction of strength has been mitigated by  special  efforts on the part of the London County Council  and the  administration  of  the  brigade by certain emergency measures which, briefly stated, are as follows    Over one hundred motor fire  engines  and  other motor  appliances nave been substituted for similar horse drawn machines  since the outbreak of war,    A number of volunteers have  been specially treine-d in fire brigade duties and plaoed at the disposal of  the  Chief  Officer,&quot;together with detachments of the Royal  Engineers  who render assis- tanoe during air  raids,besides  which some members of the staff of the Metropolitan  Water Board and a small  number  of members of volunteer fire brigades are available.    Under present  arrangements, Ts3f&apos; none of  these auxiliaries oan  be depended upon to arrive at wie rire stations in any considerable numbers in sufficient time ir  ejsure their riding on the engines between the interval of the nrst warning of a raid and the actual  attack taking    place
    &apos;  A general arrangement  has  alsa  been  made  with the principalfire brigades adjacent  to  but  outside the  London County Area  thatthey will attend in London upon  thoir services  being requisitioned,but unless some system  can be  devised for  bringing them under thedirect command of the London Fire  Brigade  the process of summoninga considerable number of these engines from the outside districtswould  take so long as to render  ineffective their attendance.      The attack made on the 7th July,  1917, was, I understand,undertaken by hostile aircraft carrying mainly  or wholly explosivebombs  but this attack resulted in  the simultaneous raising of threevery serious  fires,  one in a building of vital  national importanceand the other two in an area where owing to the congestion ofware-house  buildings and the inflammable nature of the contents thedifficulty of attack from  the  firo brigade point of view was  extremeand the liability to the spread  of fire most serious.      I have  no doubt whatever that had the attack been made  witha similar number of incendiary bombs  a series of fires would  havesimultaneously broken out  which  would have overtaxed the presentresources of  the London Fire Brigade..  I need hardly mention  thatthis is a consideration of the utmost secrecy v/hich should on noaccount be made public.      The situation therefore  calls for immediate action in orderto secure as  far as possible that  the material  and perseanslshould be augmented by    (a)   The recall of the  members of the uniformed staff of the          London Fire Brigade  now  on  active service with the  Fleet       -and the Army, namely,  one officer and 178 men in tho Navy,          and  officers and 68  men in the Army,  -    (b)   Arranging that Royal Engineers to the minimum number of          the preoent demolition sections&apos;  (ninety) with six motor          lorries should be  at all times available and ready  to          take up their allotted stations  in case of necessity.          In  addition,  a similar number in a mobile detachment          should be available  at one  hour1s notice,  and that  a          further detachment should be arranged for to proceed to          London in case of  need.   (Additional  Royal Engineers were          sent up to London  on the 7th instant  by instructions from          General Headquarters,  Home  Forces, and carried out  useful          work in clearing thoroughfares in order that traffic might          be  resumed.)    (c)   Arranging that In  case of an air raid warning boing issued,          the fire brigades  in the Metropolitan Police- area outside          the county of London should be placed temporarily under       &apos;   the orders of the  Chief  Officer  of the  London Fire  Brigade          so  that a plan could be  made to  enBure their services          being speedily obtained  in  the event  of the engines being          required within  the  County  of London.      In view of the fact  that separate representations would borequired to be made in  the case  of (a)  to  tho Admiralty and the WarOffice, and in the case of (b) to  General  Headquarters,  Home  Forces,and for (a) to the Home Office,  as in the  last  named case the pro-posed  action  would involve instructions to numerous  local authoritiesand presumably an order under  the  Defence  of the  Realm Act, and havingregard to the national  importance  of  the issue, it is thought that the. . ._   ___&apos;r____
better course is to ask you to place this letter before theWar Cabinet.      I would add that this letter is being transmitted with theapproval of the Chairman of the London County Cduncil (The 3ightHonourable the Marquess of Crewe.       P.C), and that Mr, F.L.DpveChairman-of the Fire Brigade Committee of the London County Council,will be prepared to attend at the Offices of the War Cabinet to giveany additional information which may be considered necessary.                                   &apos; I am, Sir,                                     \  Your obedient Servant,                              (Signed)  S. SLADSJJ.                                      Lieutenant-Commander&quot;,                                         Chief Officer, L,F*B.The Secretary,      War&apos; Cabinet,         Whitehall  Gardens,  2*17*
