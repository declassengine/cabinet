                 From. Viceroy, Army Department, 11//?../;//.?/ 1917.   .            . ;&apos;..         .V.:.(liepeated to Tehran.) &quot;j        V^-:;;-^:;:?;.*;:v        &quot;   .- v&quot;   v- -  -. -   - - (Received 10.15 a.m.)  . ;(        v-7\;-/: &quot;v.:-;V ;::$3341    -10236.  Your telegram of the 20th ultimo.      ,1.  Review of j\larling&apos;s 202 Ft shows that his information was. inaccurate   .... on all material points such as organisation, conditions of service, and finance.    . We do. not wish to enter into a controversy on these: matters,  especially as     Lieutenant-Colonel Orton&apos;s report on  the South Persian Rifles, forwarded    . under  Sykes&apos; 1.1 A.Q.C., of 20th May, which we understand to be the scheme     referred to in. Marling&apos;s ,202  F, appears  to us to be sound in respect to;    - distribution and organisation ofunits, though the financial, arrangements     proposed -/will-require further examination.       2.  We regret, however, the  tone: of the Minister^  telegrams, when  dis-    .cussing the actions and  views of this. Government, and  desire to  remind him     that, so long as we remain, responsible for the supply and maintenance of     South  Persian Rifles,  we  claim to  do so in the manner which seems to     us.to he most conducive to efficiency.       . 3. The four chief statements are :; -       &apos; (a).That Sykes was tied in-financial matters, whereas the. facts  are  that             Sykes has been governed  by  no  regulation, nor has  any  effective             check on his expenditure been so far possible.      .--(/;)  That the Inspector-General should  be authorised to spend up.to limit            - of his approved budget.of three million tomans.   So far as - we - are             aware he has not evolved any  serious.budget, and the difficulty has .            : been to pin him down.to any reliable estimate of expenditure.   . :   (c)  That progress was hindered by red  tape regulations.  We are at a loss             to understand what  is meant, as Sykes has throughout had  an          -absolutely free hand.         ,v:.                        -  .    .  :.(d)  That the South Persian. Rifles,  being  a  Persian  Force,  should  be             organised  under local  conditions.   We agree with the remark  that        ;..: :.  Lieutenant-Colonel Ortons proposals meet  local conditions, while          --.  at the same time, following the general principles of Indian unit             organisation (and  - establishes   a . course   which - has  obvious   &quot;; ;  .     advantages. &apos;&apos;- .v.&apos;; -:V           .               ;:;  &quot; .  ,-Lima ?usxj
