AIH BOAKD.                &apos;  Honort to frho Cabinet.  .&apos;23.:                                     &apos; . 7th July, 1917.            The American Aviation Mission have not yet  returned to this country from the Continent, and the Air  Board have not, during the week, received any official  comraunications from them, hut they have heard from  the   X  President of the British Aviation Commission in Paris  that the French Aviation Services have  asked the American  Government definitely to equip and arrange for the  upkeep  of an aviation corps of 4500 machines,  for use on the : French front.  The Board do not knc^f vfaat type of machines  the French have asked the Americans to  provide, nor have  they any information at present as to whether the French  have made any recommendations to the American &quot;Mission as:. to the type of machines or engines-which the Americans/V should construct, for the use of their om Expeditionary  Forces.            So far as this latter point is concerned  the  Board feel strongly: that it * 111 he desirable in Order  to  avoid dissipation of American manufacturing energy  over  entirely new or too many types with consequent most  serious waste of time that a definite programme, of  proved  types shall be adopted and that the American Government  should keep as closely as possible to this programme   In , this connection it :1s material to note  that Maj or Boiling  the head of the Mission, expressed the  desire, beforeo  he  left France,that when he went back to America he shcul&apos;?  be definitely committed by the exchange of written  documents to a specific programme..  His instructions,  which were quoted textually in:the report made to the  Cabinet last week., give him full authority to consider  and negotiate a joint programme,&apos;but he is also  required  to report thereupon to the Secretary  of War for  approval  on&apos;behalf-of the United States of America.            Apart from.suggestions which  may be made  to the  American Mission by official representatives of  the French  Aviation Services, it is clear that British manufacturers,  as well as French, will endeavour to  get into direct touch  with the American manufacturers &quot;vrith a  view to types of  aeroplanes and. engines, being pressed  on the notice  of the  American Government.  The Air Board are endeavouring to  counteract thiB &quot;by the issue of instructions to British  aircraft manufacturers requiring them not to send rlra^ings  and designs to America without the prior consent of the  Boar^, and steps have been taken to supplement this  circular by obtaining a Defence of the  Eealm Regulation  in the same sense. .            As the War Cabinet are aware, a definite  decision has been taken to assume, in reference to  British  types of engines and aeroplanes officially recommended  to the American Government or approved  by tho Air Board  for manufacture by that Government, responsibility  for any  financial disbursements necessary to  safeguard British  manufacturers&apos; interoats in design and  patent rights.  The financial disinterestedness of tho British Government
         in its recommendation of particular types, should, from         its adoption of this course,  &quot;be apparent not only to the         American Government hut also  to British manufacturers         and the fact that the British Government can prove its         disinterestedness should help considerably in securing         the object stated in the preceding paragraph viz., the         limitation of American manufacturing energy to a definite         programme of proved types.   The Board feel that this is an         additional reason of considerable weight for the adoption         of the course already approved. v.                   The Board have been pressed during this week to         give definite-answers to requests for the supply of machine         guns for, aviation purposes from the Russian, Italian and         Belgian Governments.  The request of the latter was for a         comparatively small quantity and it has been possible to         meet a part of it by the transfer of some ^Jins in Prance         but after consultation &apos;rith the War Office and in view of the         difficulty which exists in meeting the needs of the British         forcesj the Board have had to refuse the request of the         Italian Government (400 guns) and of the Russian Government         (over 6000 guns).Supply.             Delivories of engines aeroplanes and seaplanes         during the weak from British manufacturers have been as         follows.;;-                                          lliE^os Agr on lanes See/planes      .
