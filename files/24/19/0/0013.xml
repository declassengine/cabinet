6th July, 1917.I am resigning my appointment as Chief of the British118      Mission at French General Headquarters.           2.   You will remember that this appointment was pressed on me      with such insistence by both the British and French Governments,      and by the two Commanders-in-Chief, that I felt it my duty to      accept.           3.   The condition of affairs when I took up my post at      Beauvais on March 17th has passed away and to-day quite different      conditions exist which render my presence no longer necessary.      I take this opportunity to place on record my views of the present      state of affairs in France, and my opinion as to what should be      done in the future.           4.   I have been working with the French for more than 10      years;  the last three have been passed in the war;  I can there-      fore claim to have-some knowledge of France, of the French Army,      and of the French mind..           5\.   France is tired;  the country is being governed by a set      of men which does not contain  in my opinion, a single man of out-      standing ability, of broad, far-seeing and statesmanlike views nor      of personal character and prestige which might be claimed as a      National asset *fa          6.   The country women of France - the real mainstay of the      country - are tired.   They dread more heavy losses,  they are      frightened of greater taxation, they can no longer work their                                                                  little
little farras and their little businesses as they could duringthe first three years of the war/ partly because they aretired and disheartened, and partly because labour gets lessand less available, and money more and more scarce.  7.   The condition of the Army is still good,, wonderfullygood considering all it has gone through, but there are signsof unrest here, and there which, though not yet serious, makeme anxious for a long future.   The. officers are more than everdissatisfied with the President and with the Government,  Theysee changes carried out, Generals, whom they trust and in whom-they have confidence, removed, reinstated, and removed again;they 3ee the politicians in Paris seizing more and moremilitary power, politicians who may at any moment be themselvesswept out of power and out of public life,  . The presentCommander-in-Chief is a good sound soldier but he is whollyuninspiring and though he is free of all political intrigueit is common knowledge in the Army that he did intrigue, andvery successfully, to upset his.predecessor.   General Petainis not a commanding personality either in the French Army orin France and as it .is.unlikely that he will obtain anystriking success in the field this summer, owing to conditionsmilitary and political which now prevail, he will not in allprobability over seize the public imagination,   8,   The collapse of Russia has hit France very hard.  Foryears and years before this war France built all her hopes onRussia, lent her vast sums of money to prepare herself for thewar, and therefore the fall of Russia has como as a muchgreater shock to the French than it has to us.
   9,   The failure of General NIvelle to carry out his greatoffensive in the manner and to the extent which he had promised,and upon which so many, hopes had been, based, is yet anothercontributory cause to the present state Of disappointment andunrest.  10,   Difficulties of the Interior must be remembered and ofthese the -questions of German intrigue, of Socialism and ofcoal are the most menacing and the most difficult to deal with.  11.   Finally the innate distrust, dislike, and jealousy ofEngland increases as we gain successes which are no longer inthe power of French troops to achieve.  12.   What then is the outlook for the future ?.  The entryof America into the war has done much to save a situation nhiinmight have become difficult even.during.the present summer, butit will take so long for any real military assistance to reachFrance - say 12 to 18 months - that we must not count too muchon the effect, chiefly moral till next -yeary which our new Ally . .will have on France.  13.   France is still determined to win the war but she doesnot see exactly how she is going to do it and she has nobody totell her nor anyone in power whom she really trusts; the Frenchwomen are still determined to win the war but they arc tired ofincessant work and they dread more punishment for their men; theArmy is still determined to win the war but it dislikes the v/ayin which it has been treated by the politicians and it has nolonger any of its original military Chiefs in the highest commandswith power to protect its interests and direct its efforts.  Itis therefore in a rather distrustful and suspicious mind, quick                                                      to
to take offence and difficult to handle.  Nobody who knows theFrench Army of to-day i.e. the younger men in it, those who domost of the fighting,.will say that it is as fine an instrumentnow as it was last autumn, or even this spring, and yet thischange is not due to the losses lately incurred which,considering everything, have been quite moderate.        The change for the worse in France and in her Army isdue, not to recent losses but to causes, some of which I haveenumerated.   14.  My own opinion is this :-        In order to keep France as an active partner in the war,until America can act in the field with real success, we musttreat her with great consideration.  We must be helpful inevery sense of the word and when she asks us later on to takeover many miles of her front we must do so with as good a graceas we can.   We must remember that in France we have found areal Ally and a true comrade ever, since this war began and wemust pay her back in her own coin.   But, we must do more* &apos;  77e &apos;must gain such victories military and diplomatic as are withinour reach.   It is not for me to say whether Sir Douglas Halgwill gain great successes during this summer and autumn but. ItIs;, in my opinion, essential that he should try; but a successsuch as Messines, fine as that was, will not be sufficient tobuoy up the French nation.   The French themselves will win noreal success, I doubt even if they will put in another seriousattack, this year.   Unless therefore we gain some strikingsuccess, like taking the town of Lille, our military effort willnot, by itself, be sufficient to stay the French,  It seems tome therefore that we must gain real diplomatic victories as well                                                           as
as such military gains as are within our power; and at thesame time we must counter the German intrigues and the spreadof pacifist Socialism and deal sympathetically and thoroughlywith the coal-question.   15.   In short, France is beginning to die away.  I believe,if we and America know how to handle her, she will still gothrough the war to a victorious end and in brighter times shewill still be capable of feats of arms which at this moment arequite out of her power to achieve.  Without being at alldesperate the condition of France is serious and she merits, andmust receive, the utmost sympathy and the greatest possibleassistance.                               (Sgd).
