Cultivation of Lands Order 1917 (No.2)              :  Particulars received from 997 Boroughs or Urban     .. Districts show that in these districts 184,134 applications have      been made for plots, and that 165,973 plots, containing a total      area of 12,325 acres have been provided under the Order.                A remarkable report has been received from Stoke      Newington, the smallest of the Metropolitan Boroughs.      Practically no land was available in this Borough for the     &apos; purposes of the Order other than that comprised in open spaces,      but the Lands Cultivation Society, acting in conjunction with      the Borough Council, obtained with much perseverance some plots      on Stoke Newington Common and in Finsbury Park and Clissold      Park.   The land was skilfully plotted with a view of avoiding      injury to some fine specimen trees and obtaining the greatest      amount of direct sunlight, and 700 plots each containing     &apos;                           -2-
        though, the first sod was not cut until the 24th March the        whole of the land is now covered with very promising crops,        and many cultivators are already enjoying the produce.                  The Society have set up water tanks with service        pipes in convenient places, have purchased condemned wire-        ribbon for fencing at a fraction of the cost of manufacture,        have raised seedlings in greenhouses, and in other ways have        given the cultivators the advantages of co-operation.   About        45 plot-holders attended the course of instruction provided by      V the London County Council.                  It is to be regretted, however, that 500 applicants        are still unprovided with plots at. Stoke Newington.                       &apos;;. .; HORTICULTURAL SECTION.                  Notification has been received during the week of     :V.&apos;; the formation of 13 Food Production Societies, bringing tho      :  total up to: 114.      *-;:\  -  &apos;                           &apos;.           &apos;.        Fruit Bottling.   During the past three weeks the staff of        Travelling  Instructors has given upwards of 300 demonstrations      -  in different parts of the country in the preservation of fruit        and vegetables.   In  addition to this number, many demonstrations        have also been given by voluntary instructors who have received        their training at the Training Centre in Horsoferry Road,        established by the Department.                  The number  of bottles for which orders have been        received during the week was 276,132 making a total of      .&apos;. 1,014,540... The number of bottles despatched during the week&amp;       was 133,788 making a  total of 212,376. , The difficulties        which the Ministry of Munitions Is experiencing in obtaining      -delivery from the manufacturers are being overcome but very        gradually,  and further difficulties are being experienced        owing to the fact that certain railways have only accepted
consignments after-considerable delays.Potato Spraying,   Orders have now been received for the totalnumber of Knapsack Sprayers contracted for, viz; 8,848.   Thenumber of machines despatched during the week Is 1,005, makinga total of 4,776.

The Worcestershire AgriculturalExecutive Committee is prepared to support schemes for Pulpingand Drying to be carried out at Upton ana at Kidderminster.Negotiations are proceeding with Mr. Foster and Mr. Farrow ofFarrovir Limited of Peterborough, vdth a view to establishing aDrying Plant at Peterborough.            The supply of barrels is causing some difficulty.An order for     000 has been placed and agents have been engagedto visIt the principal towns In the Midlands and to obtainfurther supplies.   A supply of sacks has been obtained for thepurpose of containing apples and:vegetables.  .          .  Conferences have been held /with, the West KentAgricultural  Committee and other organisations in Kent.   Theequipment of the Drying Plant at the South Eastern College, Wye,is being completed in order to test the coal consumption andoutput of dried vegetables in the Sirocco Dryers, and arrange-ments have been made for training a number of women to act asforewomen in the. Drying Stations to be established In Kent.
TECHNICAL DIVISION Potash from Wool.   The practicability of extracting potash from v?ool on a commercial scale has been further considered.   It is evident that wool constitutes a source from which a substantial home supply of potash could be secured.   A report on the subject  . is being brought to the notice of the Potash Committee of the Ministry of Munitions. Palm Kernel Cake for Horse Feeding.   Enquiries made of horse owners who have had experience in the use of palm kernel cake for feeding horses Indicate that this cake can quite safely be fed, and in view of its relative abundance, compared with the restricted supplies of other feeding stuffs, the Department are calling the attention of horse owners to its value. Linseed Oil..   An inquiry into the use of linseed oil for stock feeding, made on behalf of the Controller of Oils and Fats, has been completed, and a note on the subject has been sent to the-:. Controller.                              ;t Plant Diseases.   During the week there has been a slight reduction in the number of fresh outbreaks of disease reported to the Department for indentification and advice.   Fourteen general reports on plant pests have been received from honorary correspondents, and 9 special reports.   The material contained in many of these reports has a direct practical bearing, and will- materially, enhance, the value of the advice given to farmers.   A summary of the reports will be circulated to all correspondents, in order that a concensus of opinion on certain important problems may be obtained.   Further evidence has been gathered as to the danger incurred through certain flies (frit fly, gout fly, wheat bulb fly) in the growing of cereals and it is clear that with an increased aeeeage under these crops such pests are - likely to form a serious menace.
           The first  instalment of  ploughmen and horses likely tobe  available during  the  next  week  or so for the 1918 Programmehas been  allotted  to 5 counties.    Representatives of the Committeesconcerned have  been  interviewed,  and the scheme:-under which themen and horses  are to be loaned out to farmers explained to them.Harvest Labour,   About  8,500 of  the soldiers made available forharvest work are now employed on  farms.   Many of the men havebeen returned by farmers as useless, and complaints have beenreceived  as to  the poor  physique  of the men sent, farmers objectingto  pay such men at the rate of 5/- per day for hay harvest work.Military  Labour on the Land.    The Military -Authorities haveissued instructions  that none of the soldiers now engaged onagricultural work  are to be. withdrawn from the land until furthernotice.&quot; &apos;. -.-&apos;.\v-.yv/:&apos;:       ;;v.c;  :                  ;&apos;Prisoners of War.Two  further schemes for the employment ofbatches of prisoners of  war: have  been sent to the War Officeduring the week.                     7.- WOMEN !S LABOUR,           Particulars have been received in the Department of5,243  women  who have enrolled and  been accepted for the Women1sLand Army,  These show  :-             .

The Superintending&apos;.&apos; Inspector reported that  work  would be: found during the winter
 months  for  *romen,  in tree  felling,  cutting of pit props and threshing,  and that  training for this work could be arranged for.          It has been decided that  the course of training can be extended from four to six  weeks in  the case of women likely to profit  by specialised instruction in the management of sheep or cattle, or  in motor  tractor driving.                     MACHINERY &quot;AM? IMPLEMENTS.         -. Thirty-three horse flr-iVeBr potato sprayers have, so far, been allocated to  14 different administrative counties.  The demand  for  potato  sprayers has however been less than was expected          It is understood that the Ministry of Munitions anticipate  great difficulty in supplying the requirements of the Department  in connection with ploughs and other agricultural imp1ement s.  Unle ss  the s e  diffIcult ie s c an be pr omptly overc ome the success of the 1918 Programme will be seriously endangered. A circular  letter  is &quot;being sent to  all Agricultural Executive Committees  asking  for particulars as to the tractor implements and horse Implements,  as well  as of the harness which can be secured- in their areas.&quot;  :l-u-----&apos;:-y                  y  SUPPLIES.  ; Supplies Sub-Committees.;The  majority of Executive  Committees are setting up Sub-Committees as requested by the Department,  to make provision for the needs  of their areas as regards&apos; seeds, fertilisers etc.   Information as to the proper scope of the activities  of these  sub-committees  has  been sent to a number  of them and a  circular  letter is about&apos; to  be issued in which their relationship with  the Department and their opportunities  to help farmera to  secure  supp1ies:are  defined. Sulphate of Ammonia.   The  de1iveries during June for home agricultural use amounted  to  about  9,500 tons,  which compares with 3,000  tons in June 1916.   This may be regarded as satisfactory evidence of the  Department1s efforts to conserve  and.distribute  this fertiliser for  home use..
Basic Slag.  Further negotiations have taken place&apos;with makersand dealers as to the price at which the various grades shouldhe sold, and this question is no;; in a fair ;vay to he settled.The prices charged by two makers have been reduced.  Statements ...are also being obtained shoeing the extent to which the outputhas been contracted for and names of dealers who have obtainedcontrol of the supplies, v/ith a view to diverting slag todistricts specially needing it, if the available quantities.aretoo small to meet the demand.Lime and Chalk.  Arrangements are nearly complete for the supplyof ground chalk in Surrey.  The Department is providing a quarryowner with the necessary plant, and it is hoped that an outputof 350 tons per week will be available by September.Sulphate of Copper.  Inspectors have been sent to nineteencounties to ascertain their requirements for this material forpotato spraying with horse machines, and to urge them to placetheir orders immediately.  Ample supplies are available.Feeding Stuffs.  The first meeting of the Oilcake DistributionCommittee has been held.  A memorandum prepared by the TechnicalDivision was submitted outlining the steps to be taken toreserve a minimum quantity of oilcake and offals for cows in milk.There was general agreement that adequate provision must be madefor the maintenance of the milk supply, but the precise lines on   Iwhich action should be taken will need careful consideration.       1Seed ffheat.  The scheme for&apos; the purchase of seed wheat of the 1916  1crop is working satisfactorily.  The actual purchases up to theend of last week were 1503 quarters (of 480 lbs each).          The number of acres of the standing crop of the          Idifferent varieties offered for inspection up to the 7th Julywas as follows:-                                  -  \ acres. -..

              It lias been necessary to  increase  the  number  of  the    Selection Committee to eight  in order  to  cover the  area in the    time available.  Arrangements have  been made whereby it is hoped    to provide new. sacks for the  cleaned wheat under both schemes.    Seeds other than Cereals.   A special  Sub-Committee has been set.    up to consider and report  on, (a) the  form of Return which the    Department proposes to Issue  to leading merchants in order to    ascertain information regarding stocks  of seed available in the    country and likely to be received from abroad during the next    few months, (b) the best means of organising the supply of seed    for allotment holders in 1918.              The Advisory Committee have  given  careful consideration    to the means; to be adopted for ensuring that an  adequate area    shall be devoted: to the cultivation of root  seeds for use  in 1919,    and have recommended, that  Agricultural  Executive Committees in-the counties concerned be  urged to  co-operate with  the  Department    in every possible way in securing this  end.             .-     &apos;           I am, ,  -  -V; -&apos;ri---[                 :y:[ \: Sir,::      - i &apos;   ;V-.V/.        ^                              Your  obedient:  Servant,Director-General.The Rt.
