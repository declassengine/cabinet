TREATMENT,6.      The Fifteenth meeting of the Committee onInstitutional Treatment was held on the  5th Instant.Their report annexed as Appendix II hereto and itsprincipal  points are as follows      -  (1)  Neurasthenia.  52 men are under treatmentat the  Home of  Recovery at Golders Green.  The furtheraccommodation required near London has not yet beenobtained,  nor accommodation -for  the two  homes requiredin the  North.        (2)  Epilepsy.  The colony at Monyhull nearBirmingham has  been found to be  satisfactory and  theproposal to set apart a villa there for  dischargedsoldiers and sailors has been generally  approved.        (3)  Tuberculosis.  The beds set apart by theMetropolitan Asylums Board for advanced  cases oftuberculosis among discharged men  in London are to he                                                   made

The completion of a sanatorium at Skipton wouldonable Brier-ley Hall, Bradford, to be utilised for 50advanced cases and.steps are being taken to secure this.         A proposal is now being made to the promotersof tho tuberculosis colony at Pepworth Hall in Cambridge-shire to appropriate 10 beds to discharged soldiers andsailers in return for a grant to cover the cost of theirprovision. ,7.

In order to deal moresystematically than hitherto with cases under these categorithe steps indicated in paragraph 10 of last week&apos;s reporthave been taken (1) by the dospatch to Dr. Dundas Grant ofthe letter dated July 6th on the subject of a Special AuralBoard of which a copy is annexed as Appendix V and (11) bythe issue by the Statutory Committee of Circular No.  ,54(Appendix VI) asking Local Committees to furnish the  namesand addresses of all sailors and soldiers in their districtswho are totally deaf and of those who, though not totallydeaf, are unable owing to deafness to return to theiroriginal employment.Training.
              -TRAINING.                                   I11.       The Training Section of the Statutory Committee -   Iconsidered, at their meeting on July 3rd questions relating 1to the payment of maintenance allowances and fees duringcompletion of apprenticeship and professional training,  &apos;.   1interrupted by the war.  Approval has been given to schemes!for training in brushmaking received from Kent, inElectrical work and Bootmaking and repairing from NewcastleIon-Tyne-&amp;in horticulture and farm-work from Berkshire.Sanction was given to the training of M&amp;iv-i&amp;uai men; in 10 1cases and in 46 others further enquiries were directed.    I12.        Detailed matters in connection with the training 1of disabled men in London were considered at a meeting of  1Secretaries and Representatives of&apos; London War PensionsCommittees at the Regent Street Polytechnic on the 29th    jinstant.          Ovor  10,000 has now been subscribed by the.public to the fund for providing hostels for disabledsoldiers during their period flf training at PolytechnicTraining Institutions in London.          The question of training a large number ofdisabled men in air-craft construction was discussed at a   jmeeting of the Chairman of the Air Board and Major Mitchell 1Advisor tfc the Ministry In Training matters, on the 30thinstant. -     &apos;13.       A copy of a catalogue of an Exhibition forencouraging work done by Wounded and Discharged Soldiersand. Sailors held in London between the 20th and 27th Juneis annexed  (Appendix VII) as containing interestingaccount of the work carried out at    (I) The Military Orthopaedic Hospitals.-    (2) St. Dunstanfs Hostel for the Blind.                3    (3) Certain Technical Colleges in London^:  -;  (4) Lord Roberts&apos; Workshops.
    (5) Certain Colonial Hospitals in England.    (6) Certain Red  Cross and General Hospitals.              vr.;;&apos;:;&apos;   ORGANIZATION.14.     A statement of the proceedings of the  StatutoryCommittee for the woek ending July 4th 1917 is  annexed(Appendix VIII).   It summarises reports by Inspectors ofAccounts on the work of various Local Committees.   Those ofNorthampton, West Bromwich, Kent, and Cheltenham aregenerally good, the disabled man being properly looked after.There is another bad report-with regard to Rhondda and atWolverhampton the discharged soldier  appears to bo neglected.In Middlesex3 Chiswlck, Brentford, and Hampton do well andStaines badly.  The bringing up of the backward Committeesand sub-committoes to the generally high standard of workis a matter requiring consideration.15.     Prom the Glamorgan County Committee come againcomplaints with regard to the treatment of men of Class W.Reserve.  It is hoped this question will be satisfactorilydealt with by Army Council Instruction No. 1036 of the 1stJuly (Appendix IX), and Circular No.  53 of the  StatutoryCommittee of the 5th July (Appendix X).  The former arrangesthat men of this and analogous cla sses of the  Re serve, whodeclare themselves or are found by Local Committees to beunfit to follow their civil occupation or unable to obtainemployment, should at once be recalled to the  Colours witha view to discharge or reversion to duty.  The  StatutoryCommittee Circular provides for the necessary  correspondingaction by Local Committees and for the maintenance of themen in the meantime.  .16.     On the 28th June, a Joint Com -Ittee was formed forthe treatment and training of disabled men in  the  East Midland                                                        .Area&apos;

Kent                   Surrey                   Sussex.17.  .    With referonoe to paragraph, 16. of  last&apos; week&apos;s reportas to the transference of the work of the Statutory  Committee.thore was found to bo a very general ohjeoticn, especiallyvoiced by the Parliamentary Pensions Group,  against  transfer-ring the supplementation of Pensions to the  Royal  Patriotic...Fund, a body formed for charitable purposes  (whereas there  isa considerable element of right to the  Supplementary Grantsfrom public funds), and not represented in  Parliamentary, aresponsible- Minister.  It was also strongly  urged  that thesum of  250,000 proposed to be transferred  was  probablyinadequate for itct objects, even  allowing for the  fact thattho new pensions  regulations provided for many  of  the objectsfor which the grant of a million  pounds was  made by  Parliament;and that it was undesirable to surrender any of the  moneywhich was likely  to be used f.)r the  objects  for which It  hadbeen provided.  The Authorities of the  Patriotic Fund weresensible of these objections and  were not anxious  to take overthe duties, especially if the Money  transferred amounted  tono more than  250,000.                      &apos;                                These
       These objections caused a reconsideration of the billand at the same time,  further consideration was given to anobjection which had always been felt in the Ministry to theadministration of Supplementary Separation Allowances beingundertaken by a public department, which was liable tocause difficulties.  Whether the department making theoriginal awards supplemented its own award, or the work ofthe original department was supplemented by another depart-ment.      Consequently amendment is now proposed in the billupon the line s that:-      (1) The main provision, that transferring treatmentand training to the Ministry, should remain unaltered:      (2) The discretionaiy supplementations, whether ofpensions or of separation allowances,- should be dealt withby a quasi-judicial Committee on the lines of the StatutoryCommittee, but smaller.      (3) Responsibility to Parliament should be secured byplacing the Committee under the Minister of Pensions, andsubject to his general directions (control of regulationsetc); ,.but that it 3hould be left full responsibility forits particular decisions, and that its independence shouldbe secured by its having Its own funds and appointing andcontrolling ltd own staff.      U)  500,000 of the Treasury Grant (instead of  250,OOC)will be transferred for Supplementary Pensions.  Supplemen-tary Separation Allowances will continue to be paid from theVote of Credit.      (5) The Private (Charitable) Funds of the StatutoryCommittee (some  10,000) will be transferred to thePatriotic Funds.      It is understood that these arrangements are accept-able to all parties * SMSSi^^                                       ;  In
     In brief the change in the Statutory Committee- hascome about as follows     (a) The Ministry has, prior to the bill, renderedunnecessary a large part of the work of the StatutoryCommittee in supplementing pensions by so extending thepublic regulation grants that supplementation is rarelyrequired.     (b) The Ministry has taken and is taking over alltreatment and training as a general and habitual publicprovision without tinge of charity, so that no outsidebody is necessary to control these subjects.     (c) For these discretionary grants, which cannotat present be reduced to rule, or readily administered bythe public departments making the main grants, it isproposed to institute a smaller body, in lieu of thelarge Statutory Committee, but similar to-it in thestanding of its members and the public confidence enjoyedand deserved by them, and in the same way responsiblethrough the Minister to Parliament!          &quot;              STAFF, etc.                       &apos; &apos;&apos; WmHMMHtMMMMiV18. :     Table III shows an addition of 90 to the staffof the Department during the week, 66 being added atChelsea to meet the recent considerable additions to thein-f low. of work there,  11 at the Tate Gallery and 10 atBaker Street.  The Staff now comprises 170 men and 3,153women, or, 3,328 in all.  The Statutory Committee employ104 men and 182 women,  or, 286 in all, bringing up thegrand total to 3,614.         During the month in which the staff was increasedfrom 2,984 to 3,328, or by 344, 1 man resigned voluntarilyand 1 compulsorily,  74 women resigned voluntarily, two                                                   were

T       The Fifteenth Meeting of the Committee was held on the5th July :1917.  Present Sir A. Boseawen, Sir Walter Lawrence andthe Hon. A. Stanley, with Sir John Collie, Dr.C.H.Bond, andDr. Hartley.  Mr. Hore was also present.1.     The Minutes of the last meeting, were taken as read andpassed.2.     Tuberculosis.  0r. Hartley reported that the MetropolitanAsylums Board had in point of fact approriated only two  pavilionsfor 20 amd 12 beds respectively.  At present  only 10 beds wereoccupied.  It was hoped thafe the pavilions would shortly be filledbut it took some time to get into touch with  possible patients.Mrs. Wood was taking steps to inform the Local Sub-CommittoesIn London, but it was desirable to get  into touch with  etherLooal Committees.  Primarily the beds would be available for thearea of greater London, but there was no reason why patientsshould notbe  also brought from outside.  It was agreed  thatletters should be written to all the Local Committees in theadjoining areas-(Kent,  Surrey and Sussex - Middlesex and Essex  -Herts, Beds,  and Hunts.), and also to the Joint Area Committeesthemselves, the latter to be asked to adopt such measures as maybe dosirable  to make sure that the Local Committees take thematter up.3.     Dr. Hartley reported on Brierley Hall, Bradford.       Containing about 50 beds into which the Town Council wouldadmit advanced Tuberculous soldiers from Bradford and adjoiningdistricts, provided that the patients at present treated therecould be transferred to the Orass-ington Sanatorium near  Skipton.       This is unfinished, and requires the expenditure  of about 10&apos;000 by the Town Council to complete\ but this cannot be doneunless a Priority Certificate can ha nht.Q^ from the Ministryof Munitions.                                                           The
      The L.G.B. will support their application providedtho Pensions Ministry will do the samej and subjeot to theBradford Town Council agreeing in writing to give thepreference to advanced Tuberculous soldiers (which they willdo).      It was agreed to recommend that the Pensions Ministryshould support the applications to the Local GovernmentBoard - at which office Dr. Coutts is in charge of thismatter - and that a letter should be written to the Ministryof Munitions asking for priority.4.    Papworth Hall.  Dr. Hartley thought it doubtful if38 beds would be required for advanced oases in this area.Mr. Stanley stated that he felt it was not altogether anIdeal place fend that the Red Cross could not undertake suchan expense as  9,000 for 38 beds, though they wouldprobably provide a less amount.   It was eventually agreed torecommend that enquiry should be made of the promctorswhether they would agree to appropriate ten beds fordischarged soldiers and sailors if a grant was made towardsthe cost at the rate of  110 a bed.5.     Neurasthenias.  Sir John Collie reported thatsatisfactory progress was being made at Highfield and 52mon were now In residence.  Colonel Maepherson had visitedthe Home and expressed his approval of all that he saw andhis gratification at the progress made by men with whom hewas personally acquainted.

APPENDIX   V.                                      6th July, 1917.Dear Dr. Dundas Grant,            As a result of the representations; which yon madeto me on the 7th June and at various subsequent- interviewsthe Minister of Pensions had decided; to take advantage of yourkind suggestion that you should preside over a Special AmralBoard which should advise him with regard to the treatment andtraining of men discharged from the Army and Navf siaffering fror.total deafness or prevented by this disability from followingtheir previous occupations.2t          It is proposed that in future cases all such menwhen it has been decided that they should be discharged fromthe Service and in past cases when they come, up for the renewal$f their pensions; or as they can be traced by LocaL  War PensionsCommittees shall be examined by the Board wfcoo should makerecommendations to:-        (a)  The specialist treatment they require (b) theirneed of training, in lip-reading, or otherwise and (c) the degreeOf disabi-llty which should be attributed to their deafness.3.          The Chairman of the Health Section of the WarPensions Statutory Committee, Sir Alfred Pearce Gould, hasbeen consulted as to the constitution of the Board and at hissuggestion it is proposed to invite the following gentlemento be members of it:-      Mr Arthur Cheale,  18  Savile Row?

This will be forwarded to the SpecialAural Board from time to time as It becomes available.5.       Y/ben this information is received it will guide adecision as to the formation of branches of the Board in othercentres of population.   These branches would 3et under thegeneral direction of the Central Board in London but would dealwith cases arising in the areas allotted to them.6.       It will be for the Special Aural Board  and its brancheswhen constituted to consider proposals you have made  or treat-ment and should they think fit to submit detailed schemes foraural clinics for the consideration of the Ministry.7.       The question of training men in lip-reading has alreadybeen the subject of careful  consideration and arronegements- arein progress for forming centres in London,Manchester, DoncasterDerby, Margate and Exeter.

                      SECTION  I.The Military  Orthopedic  Hospitals.               INTRODUCTORY NOTE.          BY COLONEL SIR ROBERT JONES,  C.B.,                Inspector of Military Orthopaedics. THE foresight of the War Office, and the sympathetic generosity of      the British Red Cross Society, have enabled the authorities to      open Orthopaedic Centres in many of the principal towns of the  British Isles, and to equip them so that the surgeon may have at his disposal every facility likely to develop and perfect treatment.     The &quot; curative workshops,&quot;  started in  each centre, owe their existence and success to the initiative and inspiring enthusiasm of King Manoel, who has acted as representative of the British Red Cross Society.  These workshops have already proved to be of very real value,  and are the latest, but not the least important, advance, in the orthopaedic treatment of wounded men suffering from physical disabilities of their limbs.   ,     ..By  the  time a soldier has passed through various phases of recovery from septic wounds in several different hospitals, and is finally transferred to an Orthopaedic Centre for treatment to correct deformity and restore the use of injured joints and muscles, his spirit is often broken.  The shock of injury, frequently in itself severe, followed in. succession by a long period of suppuration, and then by a wearisome convalescence, during which he receives treat- ment by massage or electricity, or by monotonous  movement with mechanical apparatus of the Zander type,  too often leaves him dis- contented with hospital life, its monotonous round of routine, and- its long periods of idleness.     In the Orthopaedic Centre, he finds his fellow-patients busily engaged in  employments  in which they are doing something, and it is not  many days before he asks for a &quot; job.&quot;     In the Military Orthopaedic Hospital at Shepherds Bush alone,
out of 800 patients, about 500 are employed at some regular work,which fosters  habits of diligence and self respect, and  convertsindolent and often discontented patients into happy men, who soonbegin to feel that they are becoming useful members of society, andnot mere derelicts.    Thus, when the preliminary stages of operative and surgicaltreatment are over, there is a steady gradation through massage andexercise to productive work, which is commenced as soon as theman can really begin to use his limb at all.  If his  former trade oremployment is a suitable  one, he is put to use tools he understands,otherwise some  occupation suitable for his disability, and curativein its character, is found for him.    Men with stiff ankles are set to drive a treadle lathe, or fretsaw.If put on a treadle-exercising machine, the monotony soon weariesthe mind, but if the mind is engaged not on the monotony of thefoot work, but on the interest of the work turned out, neither mindnor body becomes tired.     Men  with defective elbows and shoulders find exercise andmental  diversion in the carpenter&apos;s  and blacksmith&apos;s shops.  Iftheir hands  and fingers are stiff, working with a big swab to cleanwindows, or with a paint  brush, is a more interesting occupationthan gripping spring dumb-bells.     Those  of us  who have any imagination  cannot fail  to realizethe difference in  atmosphere  and morale  in  hospitals, where thepatients  have nothing to do  but smoke, play cards, or  be enter-tained, from that found in those where, for part of the day,  they  haveregular useful and productive work.     Massage  and exercise is no longer a mere routine : it all fits inand leads up to  the idea of fitness fitness to work and earn a living,and serve the State in an economic sense, even  if not to return to theregiment and fight once  more in the ranks  of the Army.&apos;The Military  Orthopculic Centres are situated atShepherds Bush, London.Alder He)&apos;, Liverpool.Whitchurch, Cardiff.Fishponds, Bristol.Pilkington, St. Helens, Lanes.Becketts Park, Leeds.Old Mill, Aberdeen.Bellahouston, Glasgow.Bangour, near Edinburgh.Belfast,Blackrock, Dublin.


MILITARY   ORTHOPEDIC  HOSPITAL,               SHEPHERDS BUSH, W.  Department  of  Curative  Manual  Treatment.    Since the  1st October, 1916, a new department has been inoperation  at the Military  Orthopaedic  Hospital, Ducane Road,Shepherds Bush, W., called the department  of  &quot; Curative ManualTreatment,&quot; whereby every patient, who is able  and  willing to doso, works at some  light occupation  during  his spare time in thehospital.    The principle of the scheme is based upon the following facts.It is well known that wounded soldiers  in hospitals find their lifeso monotonous, and time hangs so very heavily on their hands,  thatin many cases the mental effect of this monotony  tends  evento prejudice their ultimate recovery.  This is especially the case inorthopaedic hospitals, where the patients mostly remain for  veryconsiderable periods of time while  they are undergoing variousforms of treatment, and where as  regards their general health  theyfeel quite well,and are able to get about without much inconvenience.    Another effect of very long periods of hospital life is that theenforced idleness tends, to make the men  lose their industriousways,  and unless some  system is adopted  to counteract  thisundesirable feature of prolonged convalescence, the effect maypossibly  be permanent,  and  on their return to the army., ordischarge to civil life, they may  find it difficult to again resumetheir former active ways.   .    To obviate these disadvantages of prolonged periods of treat-ment, and to provide an environment more favourable to recovery,the scheme of  &quot; Curative Manual  Treatment&quot; has been introduced,so that the patients can be provided with some light and congenialoccupation which will serve to occupy their  minds and relieve themonotony of normal hospital routine.  They are thereby preventedfrom useless brooding over their injuries, and at the same time em-ployed in useful work for their own benefit and.for that of theirfellow-sufferers in the hospital.    In order  to inaugurate the scheme the  first  step  was toascertain every man&apos;s pre-war occupation, and from that information
a summary was compiled shewing the number of men who followedeach trade or profession, etc.  Then workshops were set  up andequipped with the requisite machinery and tools, so that as far aspossible every man might be employed at his old trade.    The patients were  then asked to  volunteer  for the  variousclasses of work in the workshops and elsewhere, according to theirtrade, and also having regard to their particular injury.  This latterpoint is a rather important aspect of the scheme, as according to thisarrangement men can  frequently be put on to work  which willhave  a direct beneficial effect upon their injured limbs.   As aninstance of this,  men suffering from dropped  foot can  be put towork a treadle fret-saw  machine, or treadle  sewing machine, thusaccomplishing, by  means  of natural  movements,  results whichpreviously had only been obtained by means of such artificial anduninteresting methods as pedalling a dummy bicycle.     The following  workshops for men of skilled trades are nowat work :      In this shop, men who were carpenters in civil life, are now                  engaged  in that occupation under  the super-Carpenters&apos; Shop, vision of a N.C.O., who is himself  a  patient,                  and who is a skilled carpenter.   The men havemade all their own  benches, and  now  turn - out a great variety ofwork.  Among other things, they repair chairs and screens, makecupboards, woodwork for plaster  department, bandage  rollers, etc.                     [See ILLUSTRATION 1].     Under the  supervision of a N.C.O. patient  who  is a master                  tailor.   In this shop various  alterations  and       Tailors.     repairs  to patients&apos; clothing  are done.  The                  tailors also make webbing straps for various orthopaedic appliances, and &quot;collar and cuff&quot; slings,  of  which a new  pattern has recently been designed by the men.      Also under a N.C.O. patient.  In this shop the most important   B   t   d Sh     ^ar*  0^  *ne  work-  cons^s of  surgical  boot-       ,  &apos;,         making.  All  kinds  of adjustments of  boots,       Makers.          ^                   according to surgeons&apos; requirements are done- elevations of soles, bars on soles,  crooked  heels, etc.   They also prepare  the  heels  of  patients&apos;  boots for the fixing of walking callipers.   In addition to  this  special work, which occupies the greater part  of their  time,  they  do all  the  repairs necessary to patients&apos;  boots.

All kinds of  surgical knives and instruments used  in,the                  hospital are now ground by the  patients by    folding 6   means Qf a macnme driven by an electric motor,                  and thus  much delay and loss of surgeons&apos;timeis avoided, which would undoubtedly ensue if the instruments hadto be sent outside to be attended to.

[See ILLUSTRATION 2].     Owing to  the kindness of Messrs. Abdulla &amp;  Co., in sending                  an instructor to  the hospital, a number of theCigarette  Makers, patients have learnt the art of rolling  cigarettes,                  and  are  now  getting  quite  proficient in  thatoccupation.     In addition  to these special skilled trades, other patients areengaged in a great variety of occupations all  over the hospital.They assist as clerks in  the different offices, as waiters, etc. in thedining hall, as ward orderlies, gardeners, lift attendants; they sawwood for the fires, and in innumerable other ways  take part in theroutine work of the hospital.  There  is also an  orchestra  corn-posed of  patients, which  is doing extremely well.  This orchestraperforms  daily at the exhibition.
(    io   )    Since the introduction of this scheme, the general morale ofthe patients has  greatly improved, and there is  now  very littledanger of any of  them getting into habits of slackness, such as theusual  hospital life tends to induce.  It is very seldom that one seesan idle man  in the hospital,  and this, in view of the fact that thescheme is entirely voluntary, amply testifies  to the popularity ofthe idea.    In  all, there are now about 500 patients employed in variouscapacities, including the workshops.

The  work was  only started in the  New  Year, by a LadyVisitor, as a pastime for the bed-patients, but it became so popularthat it was  arranged to have the men properly taught  by a ladywho is paid privately to instruct them every afternoon.    There are 1,200 wounded in the Hospital,  600  of whom areOrthopaedic patients.    Several of the best pieces of work have been done by two menwho  have lost their  right arms.  The work is done on  frameswhich fit firmly on to the lockers  by the beds.    It is hoped to organise this scheme of needlework on a muchlarger scale, as it has proved such a pleasure to  those who have tolie in bed many months on end.

The  facilities  are in most detailssimilar  to those which are available at Hammersmith  and othercentres for these special cases.   The patients  here undergo specialtreatment, operative, splint treatment, massage, gymnastic exercises,hydrotherapy, mechano-therapy, electrical  treatment, and  curativetraining in the workshops.   New workshops  are being  completedto give  training  and re-education  to  partially disabled  limbs.Amongst the crafts which are being utilised for this purpose are : Joinering, splint making, blacksmiths&apos;work, tinsmiths, boot making,tailoring, cinema  film repairing, plumbing, oxy-acetylene welding,engineering, electrical engineering,  typewriting, shorthand,  etc.,while in our extensive grounds we have made arrangements to teachland surveying, gardening, bee-keeping, etc. We have also workingagreements with chosen shops in the town to receive men as pupils,eg., wireless telegraphy, etc.   Our teachers are mostly volunteers.We hope to  make the best pupils instructors as time goes on.  Themen are  chosen carefully by  medical  officers for their specialcurative training.   Various muscles, etc., to be exercised are noted,and, as  far as possible, crafts are chosen with a view to future usein a man&apos;s civil capacity. .

THE  OLD   MILL,  ABERDEEN.    The Orthopaedic work  of the 1st Scottish General Hospital(Aberdeen), has become a separate department only within the lastfew weeks.  In consequence it is in  process of organisation anddevelopment.    Two hundred and fifty beds have been set apart for this purpose,but already it is evident that  an early extension, probably consider-able, is inevitable.  This will readily be  appreciated when it  ismentioned that the area drained by the department is all the Northof Scotland, down to and including Dundee and Perth.    At present the staff consists of : a surgeon in charge, a surgeon,an electrician, a masseur, 13 ladies who have been trained in massageand electric work, and a supervisor of workshops.    In every case the wounded soldier, as soon as he is able, is recom-mended for work, special attention being given in the selection ofwork to the disability from  which he suffers, so that  he may notmerely be  usefully  occupied, but occupied in  such  a way as toaccelerate the cure of his disability.    The Curative Workshops already in existence are :     1. A Wood Shop, where all kinds of  Joinery Work, Cabinet         Making,  Wood-carving, Fret-saw Work, and General         Repairing is done.    2. A Shoemaking Shop, where Boot and Shoe Repairing, and         Special Surgical Boot Work is carried on.    3. A Metal Shop and Forge for making Splints, Tools, and for         Iron and Steel Work generally.    4. A Net-making Shop, for  making parts of Trawl  Nets, Net         String Bags, etc.    5. A Painters&apos; Shop, for General Painting Work.    6. A Tailor&apos;s Shop.    In addition, a large number of disabled soldiers perform lightduties in the wards, while others are emploj^ed in out-door work inthe hospital grounds, e.g. Gardening, Nursery Work, etc.    Further extension is at  present under consideration in regardto the following occupations : Basket-making,Wirework, LeatherWork,  Plaster Cast Work, etc.
       EDINBURGH  WAR  HOSPITAL              (Grthopsedic  Department),                        BANGOUR.    The scope of the  utility of  the Orthopaedic Workshops andtheir present operations may he described as follows: Carpenter s  Shop :    The carpenters  shop makes for this Hospital a large quantity        of equipment which, otherwise, it would have been neces-        sary  to  purchase,  e.g.,  service  trays,  draught  screens,        hanging  wardrobes, bandage winders, tent pegs, etc.Blacksmith&apos;s Shop  :    The blacksmith&apos;s shop has furnished to this Hospital hundreds        of splints of various kinds, shoulder abduction  frames, all        the calliper irons and knuckle  joint steels required by the        bootmaker, and some hundreds of holdfasts required for        camp use.  This section has also  supplied, or is about to        supply, furniture  for the operating theatre and wards of        the  Perth War Hospital.  These  items comprise adjus-        table arm rest  for&quot;use in conjunction with operating table,        theatre trolleys, washstands, dressing trolleys for the ward        and splints.Engineer s Shop :    The engineering section is repairing and keeping in order the        whole of the electrical apparatus in the Electoral Curative        : Department, and is now making additions to  the&apos;equip-         ment of-that department.  This section is  being carried         on.  by  means of  equipment  lent to  the  department.        Among the  productions of the Engineering Department        are the Electric  Rheotome, which is  an advance on the         present Metronome and mechanical beaters in use.   This         electric interrupter works upon the principle of the electric         clock, and the outstanding advantage is that interruptions         are perfectly regular and that  the  instrument works con-         tinuously if  connected to the electric-light circuit. It will         interrupt Faradic, Leduc or galvanic  current of any in-         tensity  of therapeutic  value,  and  the  interval  between         impulses is adjustable within wide limits.

/                          (   18   )                          %   : Another product of the Engineering Department is the Mul-         tiple disc spark gap.  The original  spark  gap in use in         high frequency apparatus consists of two  or four points         in a dielectric of  coal gas or ether.   The spark gap made         and in use at Bangour has fourteen or eighteen points in-         sulated by thin rings of mica.  In high frequency appli-         cations the utmost benefit  is obtained  by having  the         oscillations of the secondary circuit of the highest possible         number.   The frequency of interruptions obtainable, with         the Multiple gap is much in excess  of  that obtained by         the  older  method.   All the  Diathermy machines in  the         Electric Department at  Bangour are fitted  with this new         gaP-     .  .Bootmaker&apos;s  Shop :    The boot-making  section of  the Orthopaedic  Workshops is         composed of  the  pre-existing boot  repairing  depart-         ment of  the Hospital with  the addition  of orthopaedic         patients able  to assist.   This section  furnishes all  the         necessary  saddlery work in leather and  felt  for splints         and frames, for  leg irons, etc., and  generally makes  the         alterations to boots for flat-foot, etc., as prescribed by the         medical officer,  but does  not deal  with  cases where  a         surgical boot involving  cork is required.   Further, this         section is carrying out the repairs  of army boots and the         amount of boots  saved to the Government  is 30 per cent.         of those which would otherwise be  rejected as unfit for         further service.           Items from each Department are shewn: -Engineering Department :    Electric Rheotome  and Multiple disc spark gap.Smith&apos;s Department:    Splints and Frames in skeleton and padded, Ward Trolley and         Theatre Washstand.Carpenter&apos;$ Department:    Trays,  Book  Racks,  Crutches, Bed Rests,  Card  Table, and         Frames of Photographs of  Electric Department  are also         the product of the Orthopaedic Carpentry Department.Bootmakers Department:    Samples of  Boots fitted with Calliper and Knuckle  Joints.
    The Military Orthopaedic Hospital, at Blackrock, Co. Dublin,was opened for the reception of patients in the middle of May,&apos;1917.The buildings occupied by it were formerly the &quot; Meath &quot; IndustrialSchool.    Very slight alterations were  necessary  to adapt the  SchoolBuildings to the requirements of a Hospital, and though it will benecessary to build operating, sterilising, and ray rooms, as an additionto the existing buildings, temporary accommodation has been foundfor all these requirements.    One very great  advantage the premises  had when taken overwas that they had fully equipped workshops in  which the boys hadpreviously been taught various trades.    The workshops  offer facilities for the making of Splints andother surgical appliances, Carpentry, Joinery, Woodturning, Hosiery,Wire Mattress making, Shoemaking and Repairs, Painting, etc.    At present the work in the shops is confined to the making ofuseful articles needed in the Hospital, but arrangements are nearingcompletion for the men to be employed in  all  the occupationsmentioned above.    Instruction in horticulture is being given in the extensive garden,eight acres in extent, belonging to the Hospital, and as this is mainlyan agricultural country, and there is an urgent need for an increasedfood supply, this  branch of  the training  should be of the utmostvalue to the men themselves and the community at large.ORTHOPEDIC   HOSPITAL,      BLACKROCK,  DUBLIN.
                     SECTION  II.ST.  DUNSTANTS  HOSTEL  FOR  THE  BLIND         SOLDIERS   AND   SAILORS.          PATRON: H.M.  QUEEN ALEXANDRA.        CHAIRMAN: SIR ARTHUR  PEARSON, BART.    At the present time the blind inmates of St. Dunstan&apos;s and itsAnnexes are about 400 in number, and the accommodation hasrecently been extended to a degree which will  make it possible towelcome nearly as many more.    More than 200  men  have, to date, passed out, having learntone, and sometimes more  than one, of the following occupations:Massage, Shorthand-writing, Telephone Operating, Boot-repairing,Mat-making, Basket-making, Joinery, Poultry Farming, and MarketGardening.    Whatever  occupation  the men train for, practically all of themlearn,  as well, to master Braille and the use of the type-writer, andto do  netting work of various kinds.  Type-writing is not taught asan occupation/except to those  learning shorthand writing, but tokeep the men in touch  with their friends by correspondence.   Thehand-writing of a blind man almost  inevitably deteriorates,  andsometimes this deterioration is very rapid.   It is, therefore, neces-sary that he should quickly learn to feel at home with a type-writer.Men who have never seen, and never will  see, a typewriter havelearnt to tap the keys with dependable accuracy and at a fair speedin a very few weeks.    Every man is given a typewriter as his own  personal  posses-sion when he has passed the writing test imposed, and on  leaving-St. DunstaiVs the men are well supplied with Braille  literature.    In the  workshops, while there  are sighted foremen in eachdepartment, the instruction is mainly given by men who are them-selves blind.   The more intelligent and apt soldiers are trained to bepupil  teachers, and it  may be  readily imagined  how stimulatingmust be the effect on a newly blinded man to find his first fumbling

T                         (   21   &apos;      - efforts directed by one who himself was blinded on  the battlefield but a few months back.        &apos; ,     The working day is divided between the class-rooms and the workshops or training schools. Two and a-half hours in the morn- ing, and two hours in the  afternoon are  the fixed times for work, but the men are able to extend these times morning and afternoon if they care  to do  so, and  a good many avail themselves of this opportunity.     The man who  learns Braille, typing and netting in the morn- ing, is in the workshops, or at the poultry farm, or elsewhere in the afternoon, and vice  versa.     Netting is taught in conjunction with Braille and type-writing, as it is found that beginners often have difficulty in  keeping their attention concentrated for more than half-an-hour or so at a time.     Cobblers are being trained in great numbers in the workshops. This is an occupation for the blind which was very little practised until developed at St. Dunstan&apos;s.   In  six or seven months a blind man can be taught to sole and heel boots just as well as any sighted cobbler could do the work,  and he will find abundant workwhere- ever he may settle after  leaving St. Dunstan&apos;s, and the chance to make good earnings.   The cobblers  are also taught mat-making, an  industry which fills in any slack time they may have and gives the opportunity to  earn good money in  another  direction.   The one objection to mat-making is its monotony, so that  its alternation with cobbling is, in a double sense, a satisfactory arrangement.;     Basket-making, the oldest of the staple industries for the blind, is&apos;taught in many varieties.. St. Dunstan&apos;s does not profess  to turnbut a man who is.a complete master of the art, able to  make every kind of basket.  Each man learns to make several kinds of saleable baskets, and care is  taken to ascertain whether any particular variety of  basket is in special demand in the locality where.the pupil  will afterwards settle and start business for himself.                     [See ILLUSTRATION  3].  ..  Another industry taught  in  the  workshops is  joinery.   No impossible attempt is made to teach a man to be a complete all-round joiner ; the aim is-rather to enable him to make a range of  readily saleable articles, such as picture-frames, tea-trays, corner-cupboards, occasional,tables, ancl the  like.  With practice, he can turn out these quite as well and as quickly as can the sighted man,  and in
                           (   22   )                         Tthis trade  the earnings of the men who have left, maintain a verysatisfactory level.     Beyond the workshops is the Poultry Farm.   Here an almostuntried industry for blind people has been proved to be wonder-fully successful.  Men are taught poultry-keeping on practical andup-to-date  lines.   They  learn  to  distinguish birds of differentbreeds almost instantaneously by touch, to manage incubators, toprepare and truss birds for table, and generally to conduct a poultryfarm, on methods which, when intelligently followed, ensure payingresults.    There  are three special occupations taught to the men who havebeen  most  suitably educated  in the past, to take up work of thekind.   First  of these comes Massage, the one occupation in which,if properly instructed, the blind man can more than hold his ownwith the sighted.    Several  men,  who occupied secretarial positions before theyjoined the  Army, are learning Braille shorthand, which, combinedwith a knowledge of typewriting, will enable them to resume  theirformer work.  Braille short-hand-writing is quite difficult to learn,and the speed  with which it  is acquired at St. Dunstan&apos;s hasastonished  experts in the teaching of the Blind....  Several  men who have obtained situations as short-hand andtypewriting secretaries, are giving unqualified  satisfaction to theiremployers,  and are earning as high or even higher wages than thosewhich they earned before their disablement.    Telephone  operating  is another out-of-the-way occupationtaught to the  blinded soldier.  The blind telephone operator cannot,of course, work in public exchanges where the flash-light system isin vogue, but is able to make good in exchanges belonging to  largeoffices and business  establishments where the drop-shutter system isinstalled.   In a few weeks the blind operator can tell by sound exactlywhich of the apparently identical shutters  has fallen, and proveshimself just as competent as a sighted employee.     Every effort is  made to re-equip  men for  their original occu-pations, and  some very striking successes have resulted.  It  is, ofcourse,  only seldom that a blinded man can resume the occupationwhich he pursued before his disablement, but no opportunity  ismissed of enabling men to take up their former work.    Of the  men who have left St. Dunstan&apos;s and have been settled attheir work,  provided with plant, given stocks of raw material, and


otherwise  started in life, the vast majority are earning sums whichprove very handsome supplements to their pensions.  Indeed there arequite a number of cases in which earnings are on a higher scale thanbefore the men were blinded.         THE  ST. DUNSTAN&apos;S EXHIBITS.    The work of the Blinded Soldiers and Sailors at St. Dunstan&apos;sHostel is of a varied character,  comprising Baskets, Mats, Joinery,Boot Repairing,  Picture Framing, Netting and resulting articles.    The Baskets will possibly  attract  popular  attention.  These.are divided into the two broad lines of  willow and cane-work. Inthe former  the linen and dog descriptions claim notice, as do alsothe market  and arm baskets, and the particularly well-made wastepaper baskets in both buff and white.  Hampers  and other varietiesare both cheap and useful.    The Cane Baskets comprise a number of ornamental as wellas useful designs.  The small work baskets have  proved so popularthat the demand can never be kept pace with, while the waste-papersare almost equally desired.  .. It would be difficult in a small space to describe the differencesin construction of the flower and carrying  baskets, but a glance atthe stall will be  full of interest, especially when it is rememberedthat they are all made by blinded soldiers who have only  beentaught the industry for a few months.    Trays  made in both  oak and elm, some with brass handlesand others with cane borders, prove very popular  with visitors toSt. Dunstan&apos;s.  The Tiles with  cane  or  oak  frames are worthnoting,  as also are the designs in Picture Framing.  The neatnessand finish may be mentioned.    Small Joinery articles  such as Boxes, Book-Troughs, FancyTables,  all made in American white wood, deserve examination,and these as well as more ambitious work such as Hen Coops andDog Kennels, give proof of the efficiency of the  instruction.                  .  [See  ILLUSTRATION 4].    Samples  of  Boot Repairing are shown,  which is one of thestaple industries  adopted  by the blinded soldiers,  many of whomare now increasing their pensions considerably by practising thetrade.  The work is as well done as it is by the sighted.-    The Mats are a great trade at St. Dunstan&apos;s, many men com-
bining it with poultry farming.   It will be  seen that they are allmade of the  best cocoa-nut fibre, that they are firm and closelywoven, and that they are well shaped and turned out in workman-like manner.  They are of all kinds and are completed to any size,to order.  The mats are regarded as remarkably good value for theprices charged, and orders come for them  by the hundred fromshipowners, London stores and others.    The various Netting  articles include Hammocks, Fruit Nets,Tennis Ball Bags, String Bags, and so  forth, all made with precisionand finished with care.    Quite a  remarkable stall,  that of St. Dunstan&apos;s,  and full ofinterest to those  who can realise the fact that everything upon it ismade by men who cannot  see.

The Workshops which were opened at Roehampton at the endof 1915 represent the first attempt which was made in England todeal in a practical way with the technical training of disabled menwhile still in Hospital.   The Authorities at Roehampton, workingin conjunction and co-operation with Major Mitchell, Director ofEducation of the Polytechnic, 307/311, Regent Street, have evolveda system of continuous.training which has proved highly beneficial,and which is growing rapidly  in favour  among the men.  Thesystem has been recognised as offering  the. best solution  of. theproblem of the employment of. our disabled sailors and soldiers, andthe lines adopted  are  being generally followed  throughout the:-Country.. v  &apos;&apos;  .               -     ;;V-.&apos;&apos;:&apos;    :: When patients are admitted to Roehampton, every endeavour ismade  to induce them to enter the Workshops and  to embark onsome definite course of training, while waiting to be fitted with theirartificial limbs.  It must, however, be pointed out that no fewerthan. 40 per cent, of the men return to their old employers and arethus provided for, while a further 35 per cent, are those with  settledhomes to whom locality is of the first importance.  These men will,as a rule, only consider  technical  training when facilities are pro-vided  in their own districts and within reasonable distance of theirhomes. The training centres which are being established through-out the Country should meet  the requirements of this particularclass.   The remaining 25 per cent, are men who will usually workanywhere  and whose  employment should, as  far as possible, bearranged before they are discharged from Hospital.  These men
                          (   26   )                         *are accepting  training in  increasing numbers and hardly any  ofthem now seek to enter the unskilled labour market.     The men who, in consequence of the elementary trainingafforded  at Roehampton,  are able  to  decide before  leaving theHospital what trade they will follow in the future are passed on  toone of the Technical Institutes or to a commercial College for suchfurther course of instruction as may be necessary.  At the end  ofthis training they are provided with  employment at the full rate  ofwage payable for the work in which proficiency has been attained.     It is important to note that the large majority of the men whohave availed themselves of the opportunities  offered to them havebeen raised in the industrial scale, and have been rendered capableof commanding higher wages than it was possible for them to earnbefore the war.     The training facilities provided at Roehampton include:              Basket making.             Light leather work.             Electrical work (various branches).             Wood-working.-             Motor mechanism and driving.             Metal turning and fitting.             Commercial  instruction,   including  book-keeping,               shorthand, typewriting, etc. [See ILLUSTRATION 5].             Poultry farming.   .  The classes in Tight  leather work were  originally started  onvoluntary lines  by Mr. R. H. Davis &amp; Co., of 79, Mare  Street,Hackney, and have since  been organised and extended on a sys-tematic basis by the Cordwainers&apos; Technical College, 42, BethnalGreen Road, by whom they are conducted on behalf of the NationalLeather Goods Manufacturers&apos; Association, free of  all  cost to theHospital.  The commercial classes have been  held on purely volun-tary lines by Clark&apos;s College for upwards of  18 months, and werethe first instruction classes to be started at Roehampton.                     [Se  ILLUSTRATINN 6],     The. Polytechnic in Regent Street absorbs or arranges  for thetraining in  other Institutes of all men  requiring further technicaltraining  in  London,  in crafts other than bootmaking and lightleather work, which trades are taught at the Cordwainers&apos; TechnicalCollege.  Men wishing for further commercial instruction are passedon to Clark&apos;s College, at any  of the Branches of which Institutionthose who have passed through the classes at Roehampton are

The various Classes are as follows : Commercial Training Class :    In this Class we endeavourto assist those who have formerly        held positions as clerks, etc., but who desire to revive        their knowledge so that they may return  to their former        employment none the worse for their absence on service.        Also we aim at helping men who through the loss of an        arm are no longer able to follow their manual  occupa-        tions, so that they may be able to fill positions where it is

        necessary for  them  to  have some clerical knowledge.        This, in  the  case of men who have lost their right arm,        necessitates such instruction as is shewn in the  series of        photographs  here  exhibited.   Both  categories are  put        through  a vigorous course of &quot; Mental &quot; and &quot; Personal&quot;        training, so that they may be qualified to occupy posts  of a        supervisory nature.  This section not only creates clerks      -  but trains men for business.Carpentry  and Wood  Work:    The instruction  given here is first in the use of the tools  and        keeping  them  sharpened, and is mainly  confined to men        with leg amputations, although one of our most successful         students was a man with the  left  hand only.  (See stool        and table legs made and shewn  here which were wholly        turned in the lathe and put together by him).  The other        articles exhibited have all been made under instructions,        as well  as a large  number of useful articles which have       . been disposed  of.  *s* See Exhibits under heading of Carpentry and Wood Turning.Electrical  Engineering:     The form of instruction in this Class is entirely &apos; elementary,         the wiring for  bells, telephones and light, with occasional         lectures and demonstrations of the possibilities  of  this         science.  Switchboard work  and the management of a         country house lighting set is also  taught, and  a number         of men who  have lost either an arm or a leg, and in some         cases both legs, have had their first start  in&quot; this section of      .   the training.          See Exhibits under heading Electrical Engineering.                     [See ILLUSTRATION  7].Metal Turning and Motor Mechanics:     This  is a very popular course, and is confined to  men with         short amputation  of the leg, except in the  case of those         working at  the lathes.  Quite a few of our students are         now filling positions as chauffeurs in private service.%* See sample of Metal Turnings under -heading  Motor Mechanics         and Metal Turning.

We appeal for old boots and         shoes to practise upon, and these are sold  to the needy         when repaired, the  money thus received enables us to         make further purchases of leather.  The students are also         taught  actually to make  boots and  shoes  and to sew         patches on  by machinery.  Many of these men will be         able to  pursue this work in their own homes.                       *s* See Exhibits.     In  addition to the afore-mentioned studies, we are able toarrange for any man with a taste for an Art craft to  follow this atthe Brighton School of Art, where we now have four  students, onefollowing  the craft of  letter cutting, etc., and the other  three arelearning mechanical drawing.                  %* See Exhibits Art Crafts.     We have four men going the round  of the  Cinema theatres,getting instruction as Cinema operators.     There is no reason for any man, having sufficient  will power,to excuse himself for not taking up  some kind of training, as weare able to give him a start in almost anything he desires to learn.     Since the opening day we have dealt with 602 men, many ofwhom have had  three months&apos;  instruction,  and some  over  sixmonths.   Attendance  is entirely voluntary, and while all that joindo not continue, the  majority do so, and  the total attendance  perday during the month of May has been 75 in the morning, from10 to 12, and 68 in the afternoon, from 2 to 4.   Usually the samemen attend twice daily.  Considering the temptation  to sit on  thesea front, and the many kind friends who  offer well  deservedhospitality, this maybe regarded as  very satisfactory.  Many joinimmediately on  arrival at the hospital, and we are greatly helpedby the students themselves in bringing before their  comrades theremedial and practical advantages of  joining the Queen  Mary&apos;sworkshops.Commercial  Training Section:     Series of photographs illustrating training of left-handed men,         etc.  Samples of accounts, etc.

                   SECTION  IV.THE  PAST,  PRESENT AND  FUTURE OF THE      LORD   ROBERTS   MEMORIAL                  WORKSHOPS.CHAIRMAN : MAJ.-GEN.  LORD CHEYLESMORE, K.C.V.O.How the Workshops  came to be Founded.    At.the close  of. the South African  War  the  Soldiers&apos;, andSailors&apos; Help Society,  which dealt with all cases of men in distressreturned from that Campaign, found that it was extremely difficultto find employment in the ordinary labour market for those menwho were, badly disabled.   It  was therefore decided to start Work-shops on a small scale, where such men as were capable of workingto a certain extent could  be  taught some kind of  a trade.   Thisidea was carried out most successfully, and on a self-supportingbasis, for the 10 years preceding the  present War, and during thewhole of that period  Lord Roberts took the very greatest interestin the Scheme.    At the beginning of the  European War it  was  realised,  bothby him  and  by the Committee  of the Society, that in order todeal with the numbers  returning disabled it would be necessaryto greatly extend the  original Workshop Scheme.   Various planswere discussed, but while the  matter was still under considerationthe great Field Marshal passed away.    As  the question of  a suitable Memorial to Lord Roberts wasraised, it was felt that no greater  and more lasting Memorial couldbe raised to him than by developing his suggestions and ideas withregard to these Workshops.   After consultation, therefore,  withthe Countess Roberts, who gave the proposal her.warmest support,it was decided to start  the &quot; LORD ROBERTS  MEMORIAL FUNDFOR WORKSHOPS  FOR  DISABLED  SOLDIERS AND  SAILORS,&quot; andarrangements were at once made  to  acquire  a large factory inLondon, with the idea that from this Centre a large manufacturingbusiness could be  established, which would give employment to alldisabled men who wished to profit by the Scheme.
IN THE TOY PAINTING DEPARTMENT.
r The First Year of Work.     In March, 1915,  the London Workshops were  opened in Britannia Road, Fulham.   The building was a commodious one, and after due consideration the Committee decided to start Toy- making as the  staple industry, thus serving two purposes, namely, training the men and capturing this pre-eminently German trade.     Machinery for making wooden  toys was duly installed, and the services of  suitable instructors obtained.  By the end of April many  disabled men were already working,  and the management was keenly following  up every intricacy of the manufacture as adapted to the special form of labour which was to be used.     By the end of the year over 80 different varieties of Toys had been produced in  large quantities, over 100 disabled men were employed, the public interest was aroused, and the future  of the Workshops, as a manufacturing centre, was assured. The Question of  Commercial Competition.     So far so good : but the business men in charge of the work saw much farther.  They saw the need of not only providing employment for  these  men, but  of providing a market for then- goods of manufacturing  in such a  way that the articles made could  be  sold to the trade at a trade price.  In this way, and in this way only, could they hope to make the Workshops pay their own way, in the future,  for it was  obvious that,  as the Society proposed  to&apos; provide  permanent  employment, a  self-supporting industry was the  only thing to be contemplated.  Before January, 1916, it became apparent that London alone  could not deal with the constant demands for employment, and  it was decided to open Provincial Branch Workshops under the control of London, thus enabling the men to work, if they desired it, in their own localities. Economic Yalue  of Specialization in  the Branches.     That the foundation of these Branches would  require an immense amount of capital, a great deal more than had originally been subscribed,  was obvious from the outset.  But, on the other hand,  as specialization was to  be the key-note  of  the  idea, the Centre could eventually save  money by arranging to manufacture goods which would assist the other Branches and the Main Work- shops, and at the same time manufacturing completed articles for
sale.  In this way the proposed metal working Branch at Birming-ham would not only make lead soldiers and other metal toys, butwould provide  all metal  parts, hinges, bolts, dies, etc., which arewanted in the manufacture of wooden toys in London.  Bradford,the printing Branch,  would  print  all  the catalogues, posters,stationery, etc.,  for all the centres, and at the same time could takeoutside orders in abundance.  And so on with every other Branch.   -    .  --:.     [See ILLUSTRATIONS 8 and 9].-    , -  -; -:  . ..&apos;    The Workshops would thus avoid paying out to other  firmswhat  they would necessarily demand  as profit, and at the sametime be enabled to  build up  several  quite  distinct and importantindustries.   So far the Workshops already planned are as follows :LONDON.                  , .   -Wooden toys  of all  descriptions,  jointed dolls,  furniture,         basket work,  and household articles.  For the  carrying         out of these industries,  it is  necessary to instal machinery         of  all  descriptions, thus enabling the Workshops to. place    v    their goods upon the market at a commercial rate.SURREY BROOKWOOD.     Basket  making of all descriptions.  Here  it is  hoped also  to         instal  a small Brush Making Plant, machinery for which         is required.EASTERN COUNTIES-COLCHESTER.     Poultry appliances,  household articles, and. patent porcelain         building bricks.  In the making of the porcelain bricks,         it will be necessary to lay down special machinery., For         this purpose capital is required...  .   ;  -MIDLAND BRANCH BIRMINGHAM..                    :--&apos;;.--     The making of ail metal parts of small toys, etc., necessitates         the equipment of this Branch with all the  best machines         and tools.    -                              .      :YORKSHIRE-BRADFORD.                              .7  &apos;     Printing, box making, and alb kinds of soft toys.&apos;  From time         to time it may be found necessary to put down a further         machine, and it is necessary to be in a position to do&apos;this         without delay.   At the moment  several  new letterpress         machines are required, in  addition  to&apos;many others-for         box making.

It  is  proposed, however, to instal a  complete        wood-working mill, capable of  tackling  large or small       . articles required for the West of England.NEWCASTLE.    Due consideration is being given to the contemplated industry        for Newcastle and district, particulars of which can  be        had  at a later date.NOTTINGHAM.    Here, also, the industry to be adopted is not  quite decided        upon.MANCHESTER.    A further Branch in  Lancashire will  probably be established        in Manchester.    As it will be seen, some of the Branches are already established,some  are in the process of being equipped, and some  are still inthe beginning stages.  The disabled men are applying in largenumbers for  admission, and we  want your help to give  themwhat  they  ask.Enlargement  of London Workshops.    Besides the great question of equipping the branch workshops,it  has  been found  necessary to considerably enlarge the LondonWorks, the heart and centre of the whole organization, as it is quitepossible that London alone may have to employ 1,500 men, arrange -ments have to be made for future work and more  accommodation.

A largenew building is now in the course of construction.  In this, besidesnew factory accommodation, it is hoped to  provide a canteen andrecreation rooms for the  men.The Extension of Workshops Fund.    And now we wish to tell all the men, women, and children ofGreat Britain how they can help.   In the first place, we invite allthose who are  in sympathy to lose  no  time in coming to see forthemselves how. the work is being carried on. We want you to seethe men at work.  We want you to realise the happy, business-likeatmosphere, to see the amazing progress made by the men, whocame  to  us, knowing no trade,  only a few months ago, and thethorough efficiency of the whole organization.    And then  we want you to ask yourselves if any cause is moreworthy of your help.    Remember that we  provide not for the present only, but forthe whole future life of these brave men.  We take them as theycome, lame and halt, from the battlefield, and  make  of themefficient, capable workmen ; not receivers of charity, but valuableunits of a huge industrial and economic scheme.     If we can get the necessary additional capital now nothing canstop our progress, nothing can prevent the workshops, London andProvincial together, from becoming one of the greatest industrialorganizations of Great Britain.     We want every penny we can get now.  The smallest amountis not too small, but we want big sums too.  Do not let us be heldup, and the  work curtailed, for lack of your help.  Send everypenny you can spare to  The Chairman, Major-Gen. Lord Cheyles-more, K.C.Y.O., 122, Brompton Road, S.W.,  and do all you  can toassist the Fund in helping with local efforts towards success.

ECOLE  DE  RE-EDUCATIONPROFESSIONELLE  DU  GRAND-PALAIS,                        PARIS.                DIRECTEUR : DR. VALLE.    This famous institution for training wounded French soldiers the pioneer of the work in France-occupies the splendid buildingof the Grand Palais des Beaux Arts in Paris.  Work of everyvariety is taught there- artistic, commercial and mechanical.  Theexhibits sent typify the width of the outlook embraced by those atthe head of the institution, who set out to fit the wounded Frenchsoldier for civilian life.  We  may have institutions in Englandwhich are more highly developed in one department or another;it is doubtful if we could show one  which touches civilian andindustrial  life so successfully at so many different points.  Withregard to this exhibit the Committee desire to place on record their
special thanks to the Foreign Office and  to Sir Austin-Lee of theBritish Embassy in Paris, without whose help it would have beenimpossible to get the exhibit over intime.

California House was opened in December, 1915, to woundedBelgian soldiers as a Day Club.   Kitchener House  for  Britishwounded sailors at 8, Cambridge Gate, has been opened under theauspices of the British Red Cross on the  model of CaliforniaHouse.  Men who have lost one or both legs, or who are paralysedfrom the waist downwards, are  encouraged to take up decorativehandicrafts, languages, etc.   Nearly all the work exhibited has beendone by soldiers while still under treatment at the hospitals, by menunable to walk, by men suffering from shell shock or by men whohave lost one arm or leg.  California House is now giving prepara-tory Technical courses ; courses in Applied Design, lessons in book-keeping (typewriting,  etc.), and is  teaching  English, French  toFlemings, Russian, Italian and Spanish.  Lunch and tea are givenfree of  charge to soldiers in hospital, and the attempt is made togive the Club a home-like atmosphere, as the men who attend it are

The section of the  South  African Military Hospital for there-education of limbless and otherwise permanently disabled SouthAfricans will, when all the buildings are complete, consist of thefollowing workshops :     1. Engineering Shop, equipped with oil engine, direct current        generator, switchboard, battery of accumulators, plain and        screw-cutting lathe, benches and tools for fitting exercises,        brazing hearth with pressure blower for gas, small emery        grinder, made from a disc fan by pupils in the shop
    2.  An Electrical Shop, for training men in the wiring  for bells,        telephones and electric light.    3.  A Carpentry and Joinery Shop.    4.  Motor Engineering Shop.    5.  Cinematograph Operating Box and Projector.    6.  Typewriting Room, containing the usual makes of machines        and other devices  usually found in up-to-date business        offices.    7.  Business  Training Class-room, in  which  men  are  taught        Book-keeping,  Commercial  Correspondence,  Business        Routine, Salesmanship and Advertising, also certain sub-        sidiary subjects, such as Shorthand,  Handwriting, Com-  &apos;        mercial Arithmetic.  Students  of  this  class qualify  by        taking the London Chamber of Commerce examinations.    The South African Military Hospital  is probably  the onlyhospital in which patients commence their training before reachingthe convalescent stage, and quite  a  number of the men  receiveinstruction  in  Type-writing,  Book-keeping, Commercial  Corre-spondence, Theoretical Electricity, etc., while actually in bed. Onlythose patients who  are  permanently disabled, and who will neverbe fit for further military service, receive training. In the  case oflimbless men, a long  and  somewhat  wearisome period before aman&apos;s stump becomes suitable for him to be sent to  a fitting hos-pital for an  artificial limb,  is filled in  by a course of  profitabletuition which in itself tends  to aid recovery,  because  the  patient issuitably and usefully employed.    The sole aim  of the training  at  the South African MilitaryHospital is to produce skilled craftsmen or experts in office work,and since proficiency in all stages is the aim, the actual work pro-duced  is always subsidiary  to the  training, the gauge of  successbeing rather the production  of earning power by each man insteadof the production  of  articles for the use or admiration  of thegeneral public.    The original  workshops were  erected by the South AfricanCommittee,  and they were equipped  by the  Committee of theGovernor-General&apos;s Fund.   The extension is being  erected at thejoint cost of the two Committees.                               E

Embroidery and needlework was commenced in this Hospitalearly in 1915,  and  has been an increasing industry ever since.Large numbers of patients pass away the weary hours of hospitallife in doing pieces  of work, and a very high degree of skill hasnow been attained and most artistic results have  been achieved bythose who, up to the time of admission, had never threaded aneedle.
200LEARNING LEFT-IIANDE1) WORK
    The expense entailed by the large amount of work being done(as, usually, about 500 men are working) comes to between  50and  60 per month.  This is recovered by sales of the work donefor the Red Cross, and the patients are always enthusiastic in makingthese sales a success, and presenting their best pieces of work forthis purpose.    The work-room  is  managed  by ladies  connected with  theHospital, who proudly boast that they have never had to appeal tothe public for funds and find the sales of work sufficient to coverexpenses.    Those men who desire to work at carpentry, toy-making, etc.,can do so at the &quot; Technical Hut&quot; which has been erected and  isbeing maintained by the Patriotic Association of Newfoundland,through the Overseas Club.   Men  skilled in various trades work agreat deal, and a highly trained instructor is in  charge of the  hutto give advice and help to beginners.    The practical result has been that the men are happy and con-tented when working, and the beneficial effect, mentally and bodily,is testified to by both doctors and nurses.

A series of handicrafts for the wounded soldiers at the RoyalVictoria Hospital, Netley, was introduced by a committee of ladiesin&apos;April, 1916, with Lady Emma  Crichton as President, and bykind permission of Col. Lucas, C.B., the commanding officer, whograciously found accommodation  and a suitable workshop in thehospital.  An appeal for funds was  made locally in the press, which
rbrought in a beneficent response, and enabled needlework of variouskinds to be  commenced  by the patients.  Originally the  workfounded was intended to give a distraction  to the wounded only,but it was found to be such a success that it was soon realized therewere enormous possibilities in the idea, and a teacher was engagedby the committee from the Royal School of  Art Needlework tosupplement their labours.  One of the reasons for the excellence ofthe work is that it has expert guidance.   Cushions, blotters, work-bags, trays, petit point chair  seats, Jacobean embroideries suitablefor curtains, fire screens, etc., in fact almost every kind of embroi-dered article  is now made by the wounded soldiers.  Rug makingwas introduced, and is much appreciated by the patients. Wonderfulspecimens are the result of their efforts.  Bath mats, door mats,hearth rugs are made, and this particular occupation is most popularamong the nerve and shell-shock cases, who find the work soothing,and a distraction from their sufferings.  The wounded men are alsotaught bead work,  leather  work, netting, light carpentering, andbasket making.  The latter enterprise, which is taught by a skilledinstructor, has proved an  enormous success, and many of  themaimed men who will be unable to follow their former employ-mentare now interested in work which will be of great benefit tothem on their discharge from the army.   Many varieties of basketsare made, including clothes, picnic,  laundiy, garden  and breadbaskets, etc.  Cane and rafia basket making is taught to bed patients.The men are deeply interested in their labours, which help to relievethe long hours  on a bed  of sickness, and  are  rewarded by  theappearance  of their finished products, which are regarded withlegitimate pride.    The most wonderful thing about all this work is that none ofit is done to wile away a merely tedious convalescence, but actuallyduring hours  of pain.  Netley is a  serious place, where there arefew convalescents, as the  more distant auxiliary hospitals under-stand the term.  The most serious cases are left here ; nearly everyone is  a  cot case, and when they become convalescent they  aredrafted away to other hospitals to make room for fresh cases, whichon account of their  severity cannot be taken further from the frontthan Netley.   The effect of light employment is considered by thestaff to be most beneficial  to the patients&apos; mental and bodily coh-dition.    The men are not allowed pecuniary benefit for the work done
during their stay in hospital, but as a recompense  they are allowedto make and to keep for themselves a duplicate of every piece ofwork  which . they have finished.   This arrangement has alwaysproved most  satisfactory, and is  highly appreciated  by the  men.Work is carried out on business  lines, and orders are taken andexecuted for  the various  kinds of work done by the woundedsoldiers in this hospital, which contains 3000 beds, and periodicalsales and exhibitions are  held  to  enable the committee to  meetexpenses, in order to continue this great work so happily begun.

J. S. BOSTOCK, R.A.M.C.                 Workshops for  Wounded  Men.       HON. ORGANISER : Miss SYLVESTER SAMUEL.    In these workshops the majority of the men are patients whoare convalescing from severe injuries, or from &quot;shell-shock.&quot;  Inmany instances  they are sent there by the medical officers as acurative measure.   The Commandant considers  the  occupation,and the interest has proved of great value in  helping towards amore speedy recovery to health in such cases.
2    The workshops include :                (1)  Basketry.               (2)  18-pounder shell case making.               (3)  Carpentry.               (4)  Toy making.  .    All the basketry  and shell case exhibits have been made bymen with no previous knowledge of  basket work before coming toSummerdown Camp Hospital.  They only remain a few weeks inthe Hospital, and new workers are in constant training to take theplace of men about to leave.    Paid professional instruction is provided, but as soon as a mancan make simple baskets correctly he, in  his  turn, teaches novices.It is found  that this responsibility is a further factor towards therecovery of these patients, especially those suffering from  &quot; shell-shock.&quot;    Effort  has been made to encourage war work and the  makingof useful articles in preference to articles  of luxury.

Instruction has beengiven to suitable patients twice  weekly, in the  hospital, with theobject of teaching a handicraft  to men about to be invalided outof the army.   It has been much appreciated  by them, and a keeninterest taken in the work.RED  CROSS  NEW  COURT  HOSPITAL,                    CHELTENHAM    (Auxiliary to the 2nd Southern General Hospital, Bristol).COMMANDANT : Miss  KING.    The needlework done by the patients at New Court Red CrossHospital, Cheltenham, was started  about a )^ear ago by the MissesFawkes, and has proved of the greatest assistance in helping themto forget their pains, and in relieving the tedium of their long hoursin bed.  Only the slightest instruction has been given the men, sothe results we  think most wonderful when one considers the unusualoccupation  it  is for their hands.  The  men themselves take thekeenest interest in it, and although there are only  77  beds in thehospital, within the year they have embroidered about 700 articles,which have  realised over  200 for various hospitals,  112 of whichwent to benefit St.  Dunstan&apos;s.  Work done by men who have had
the misfortune to lose an eye is quite up to the standard of theothers.                LIST  OF  EXHIBITS. 1.  Nightdress sachet 2.  Glos. Badge in Frame- 3.  R.A.M.C. Badge in Frame 4.  R.E.

RED  CROSS  AUXILIARY  MILITARY          HOSPITAL,  BIRKENHEAD.    Birkenhead is a large  town and  has only one  Red CrossHospital.  The Committee recently offered to erect a ward of amore permanent nature to hold twenty beds, which offer was acceptedby the War Office.    Owing to some alterations in the  plans and the difficulty ofthe labour question, the ward was not completed until December,1916.   It is now  occupied,  and the Hospital has fifty-five beds,with five emergency beds in reserve.    The Staff consists of a salaried Matron and a Night Sister, andthe Members of  V.A.D.  Cheshire  40,  V.A.D. Cheshire 54,  andV.A.D. Cheshire 124.                 LIST OF  EXHIBITS.          Rugs  made  by Wounded Soldiers.            1. Sergt. GARRATY, Glosters.            2. Pte. S.

(a) Yfhether he is suffering from a  disability which prevents         him from following his civil occupation.     (b) Whether  he is without civil  employment  and unable  to         obtain such employment.    NOTE.-Care must be taken that this Army Form is not sentto a  Class W., W. (T.), or T.

(T.), or  T. of the Reserve, in accordancewith para. B. 2 (c) of that A.C.I.   3. The Officer i/c Records will carry out the following procedurein the case of         .                    -   -     (a) A reservist  whose  reply to  (a) or (b) of  para. 2 is in the         affirmative;                                        -   -     (b) A reservist  (rightfully placed in Class W., W.

The cases which the circular was designed to meet were those in  which aman apparently eligible, owing to disabilities due to military service, for transfer toClass P or P (T) of the Reserve or discharge had been transferred to Class W, W (T),or T, and was in necessitous circumstances.  It is not anticipated that such erroneoustransfers will have occurred after  the 1st February, 1917, except perhaps in one ortwo isolated instances, but representations have now been made that men correctlytransferred to Class W,  W (T), or T are in some instances unfit to work or unableto obtain employment.    3. The War Office are accordingly seeding  a  Form to all men who have beentransferred to Class W, W (T),  or T (except those transferred on compassionategrounds  and  those whose  cases are already being investigated under Circular 31A)to See whether they should be transferred to Class P or P (T) or be discharged.The Form requests each man to state (a) whether he-is suffering from any disabilitywhich prevents him from following his civil occupation, and (h) whether he is without,and unable  to  obtain,  civil  employment.  Where  the  reservist  replies to  eitherquestion in the  affirmative he will at once be recalled to the Colours.   The reservistswhose cases are reported  by Local Committees under paragraph 4 (6) below willalso at once  be recalled to the Colours.   On joining the Colours the men will bemedically exaniined ; those who  prove to belong to Class A, B (i) or C (i), or to belikely to become so within six months, will be kept in the Army, the others will bedischarged altogether from the Army with any pension or gratuity to which theymay be entitled, and will become  ordinary civilians in every respect with no furtherfinancial claims on Army Funds.    4. Meanwhile, as in some cases the reservists  may be in necessitous circum-stances,  the War Office  have requested the Statutory Committee to arrange for the   (B1700) Wt P1184-G447. 20000.  7/17.  Sir J. C. &amp; S. Qp. 32.
 issue by Local Committees of temporary weekly advances in deserving cases where-the reservist makes application to the Local Committee for assistance.     The procedure will be as follows :        (a)  Where a soldier transferred from the Colours to Class W, W (T), or T of           the  Reserve is in necessitous circumstances,  owing  to bis being out of           employment and unable to obtain it, a temporary weekly advance of           money, at the discretion of the Local Committee, should be made, not           exceeding 145. a week, pending receipt of the notification from the Officer         &apos;  in Charge of Records referred  to in sub-paragraph (6) below, after which           no further advances  should be  made by  the  Committee.  In any case           where no notification from the Officer in  Charge of  Records is received           within two weeks of the report made under sub-paragraph (&amp;), the Local           Committee should inquire of  the Officer whether there are any reasons           why the Committee should discontinue in making the advances.
