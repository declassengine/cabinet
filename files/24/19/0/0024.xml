126SECRETWAR CABINET3.T.1324SITUATION  IN  AUSTRIA.(Note  by the  Director  of the Intelligence- Division^dmiralty)      The following has been received from absolutely reliablesources:^      Eor some time past there have been signs that conditionsIn Austria are most serious, and the Emperor is credited byoertaio members of the diplomatic circle with a desire,forpeace.   Politically matters appear to be most unstable.   Thefrequent changes of government in Hungary show the difficultiesin which the Austrian Empire now finds itself.      As regards political conditions, the fall of Count Tiszacaused a considerable sensation, and was attributed to a differenceof opinion between him and the Emperor as to the introduction ofliberal reforms.  Esterhazy is regarded as too young for the postand lacking in practloal experience.      Definite information has been received regarding seriousstrikes in the latter part of May in munition and militaryfactories in Vienna, and it is an interesting faot that thesestrikes were not caused by a demand for higher wages, but forfood.   An arrangement was arrived at, and the strikes were quelled,but there is no doubt that they were symptomatic of the feelingwhich prevails, and which leads to a lack of discipline hithertounimaginable.      The sufferings of the people in Austria are reported to bevery great, and to be visible on the faces of the inhabitants tosuch an extent that the fuiure generation is expected to be smalland feeble and insufficiently developed,  In May the prices offood were almost prohibitive, and in restaurants in Vienna avery indifferent luncheon cost at the least 25 crowns.  Tobaccois almost unprocurable.  Although outwardly in Vienna life is muchas usual, and the theatres and restaurants are well filled, onehas only to leave the richer part of the town to see a verydifferent state of  fairs.     There have been undoubted signs of strained relationsbetween Germany and Austria, and though superficially mattershave been reotified, there is no question oheX the feeling existsand is increasing in strength.(Sgd)   W.R.HALL.D.I.D.7th July 1917.
