SECRET.ed by the Secretary of State for India.        X from Private Letter from Lord Ghelmsford to Mr. Chamberlain,                          dated 7th June 1917.Paragraphs 3 and 4.    I come now to paragraph  10.  You advocate simplicity in the definitionof our objective and yon define it  as the  &quot;development of free institutionswith a view to ultimate self-government.&quot;  But this is to be accompanied    (1) Iry a very clear declaration that it is a distant goal;   (2) by the assertion that the rate of progress and the times and stages by          which it is to be  reached  must be controlled and decided by  His          Majesty&apos;s Government.   Is this in substance very far removed  from  our  formula?  Your qualifi-cations will have to be stated in terms of precision ;  and  though they maydiffer in language from our formula, your definition will in the end be verylittle shorter than ours.  But  we shall not quarrel over words.  The pith ofthe thing lies in a clear statement of the objective coupled  with the provibosthat it is a distant objective and that the rate of progress and the times  andstages by which it is to be  reached cannot be  stated now, but must becontrolled and decided by  His Majesty&apos;s  Government. We do not contendfor anything more.  We only  hope that you will find it easy, easier than wedid, to put your policy as to the objective into language which holds out ahope, but  which is free from ambiguity.   The  concluding sentences  of this paragraph from &quot; after all we must&quot; tothe end  deal with the  real danger  and difficulty of the present situation,  andwe are fully alive to these.   We fear that a catastrophic change may be forcedupon us and that short cuts  to the goal may be attempted which will bring withthem  a store of troubles for our successors.  1 forward herewith a letter from0&apos;Dwyer to the Home Member which is very pertinent to the matter in hand.Coming from one of our ablest administrators  it deserves the most carefulconsideration.   In paragraph 11  you say that you wish  to increase the authority  andresponsibility of the Indian representatives in ihe Councils, and later on  yousay :  &quot; Next in importance  I place a reform of  the electoral  system and  the&quot; extension of the franchise.   Personally I am disposed to think that  the&quot; system of indirect election works badly and produces the  very evils against&quot; which it was intended as  a  protection.&quot;   With very great respect, are  younot putting the cart before  the horse ?  If we are  to give further powers,surely the first thing that we have to do is to improve, if possible, the qualityahd the representative character of the people who are to have these powers.We make  this point in paragraph 43 of our despatch.   Personally, I am  notenamoured of the line of advance to which we lind ourselves  pledged by  theMorley-Minto reforms. To my mind those reforms skipped a whole  stagein the  evolution  of  representative  institutions.    Edward the First&apos;sParliament  ivas  preceded  by  the  Magnum Concilium  period  duringwhich the great nobles and landholders advised the Xing.  If Morley hadstarted with such a body, we  should have by now a considerable  nucleus oflandholders  and men of family, who had served their apprenticeship andcould hold their own with  the  journalists  and lawyers.   As it  was,  thosemen would not condescend  to compete for election in the first Councils, andIdoubt whether we can now  enlist their help except  by nomination.   It isdifficult, if not wellnigh impossible, to retrace  constitutional steps, and sowe felt  bound to go  forward on  the lines  laid down for  us by Morley andMinto, and the object  of our present proposals is to  endeavour to  make  thepresent  representation somewhat more real than it is to-day.
