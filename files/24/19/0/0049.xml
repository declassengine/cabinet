     WAR   GAB I, NE T.  ::PROPOSED TO PROGRAMME Of^MERCHANT SHIPBUILDING 1    ^Memorandum by .the Shipping Controller.;1 &apos;The memorandum of 5th.July submitted  to  the  War  Cabinet by Vice(fesiral Sir Brio Geddes shows  thet granted certain conditions as toLabour and material, an output of-3,000,000 tons gross  of merchantshipping per. annum con be achieved in this country within a eompara-tively short space of time.    She Shipping Controller cannot urge too strongly upon the WarCabinet the absolute necessity of at once  taking steps  to carry SirEric Geddes1 proposals into effect.    Since the 3,000,000 tons  programme was first  suggested by theMinistry;.of Shipping the rate  of loss has  not  substantially declined.Subject to periodical fluctuations it has  remained for   months pastat about 20 large ships a week.  To balance looses at this rate anoutput of not 3,000,000 tons but 4,500,000 tons  is required,  or,  ifallowance is made - as it should be made - for ships damaged beyondrepair,probably 5,000,000 tons. v;: Until equilibrium is brought about between losses  and  gains,imports, which notwithstanding enormous war demands are already lessthan half the peace figure, will continue  to fall  off.   It was pointedout in Sir Joseph Maclay&apos;s letter of the 27th  June to   the Prime Minister that, on the basi3 of the then programme, the irreducibleminimum would be reached not later than February next.    The increasedoutput of tonnage foreshadowed by Sir Eric Geddes  should have  theeffect of postponing the critical date  by  a few months,  but  theposition will still be extremely serious,  if losses continue,  until theharvest of next year,  when if  anticipations are realised the foodposition should be comparatively secure,   v;    The programme now under discussion must therefore  be regarded asa minimum and nothing should be permitted  to interfere  with its dueexecution.-&apos;.    Admittedly it fells far short of establishing equilibrium but itd.11 at least afford a breathing space, in which a better measure  canbe taken of two uncertain factors upon  which much  depends.   The first,is the effect of improved methods of nrotection and the second,  theextent to:which America may be able to  help.   On  the first,  the ShippingController hazards no opinion.  On the  second, it  is necessary to  pointout, that,  having regard to the fact that  America  will  have to transportsnd maintain her overseas contingent and bearing in mind the undevelopedcondition of her shipbuilding  resources, she is almost  as likely to bein need of help herself, during the next twelve months,  as to  be in aPosition,to afford help to her Allies.  Moreover it is  obviously undesir-able, - in view of the post-war  position, that the United States should   .taii Id &quot;-more- rapidly than the United. Kingdom.  ,.             vA^v&quot;WS^!(   The situation will therefore have  to  be reviewed at on early  dete  . \-nd the contingency of a further-considerable  increase  in nationalProduction must be reckoned with.    It should be added.that the rapidly growing d amend for oil tankVessels, mainly to meet.the Admiralty requirements threatens  to encroachseriously on mercantile tonnageAccording to recent arrangements,  12standard ships a month will be adapted  for eventual conversion intotank steamers.  If :tb4a.demand&apos; materialises, the   effective output of  wcargo vessels will be reduced  by at least  500,000  tons  per  annum.     -\1c 1 &apos;SECRET,.:O.  1348.Hh. July. 1917.
