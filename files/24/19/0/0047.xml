M.....HI I  .......m                   FINANCIAL SITUATION  IN CANADA.Decypher of a telegram from the Governor  General of Canadareceived at the Colonial Office the 8th day of July 1917*at 11.40 a.Eu- July  7th.   Following from Sir Robert Borden for Prime Minister begins:-&apos;    We have earnestly considered your cipher telegram of July 5th as to  financing of yonr purchases of Munitions, of War, cheese.,; and other  supplies in Canada&quot;and we are moot anxious to assist in. every way  possible.   Minister of Finar.ce has been in consultation with  Sir H, Lever representing Imperial Treasury in United States with  a view to  deposit with Minister of Securities by Imperial Government against an ieuue of additional ncte  Circulation which would enable  us to help you.  ..; If the Treasury  can lodge with Bank of Montreal in  London for our account or with Minister of Finance here  Canadian municipal, provincial  or provincial guaranteed or other high class securities, Minictor thinks we could issue  over the.next throe  months fifty million dollars of  additional oircu- lation which  would be available to assist to that  extent.  It is olear to us that the isfi-e of rasecured circulation would so seriously  prejudice market poEllicn of our securities and success of future  loans that it would result in our raising less money rather than mere within the next four months.   Position of our securities on market is quite critical owing to Canadian Securities being debarred  from American market since entry of United States into  the War.  Minister of Finance has been endeavouring to  obtain consent  of United Spates Government to issue loan:in New York.  He may be able to  arrange this later but at present there is no certainty. Minister 2$ of opinion that your Government should strongly press  United States Government to permit  you to use from proceeds of their  (?) loans to you twenty five  to  fifty million dollars  monthly towards meeting your commitments in Canada. Balance  of trade between Canada and United States  is greatly in favour of latter and New Xork Exchange is now at a heavy premium here.   Dealing specifically with expenditures  mentioned in  your telegram Minister  of Finance.says that if Treasury will lodge &apos; securities as suggested above he will issue note circulation to meet  your  purchases of (?) cheese.  We shall not be able to  find funds for  War Office purchases of hay, oats and flour through Department of Agriculture.  We shall as arranged assist Imperial Munitions  of  War Board to extent of twenty^five million dollars a month during  July, August and September.  Balance  of their r-j^uir.- meats should  be furnished from United States loans to your. Govern- ment. It  is  not possible to arrange further Bank  credits as Minister fca.B. exhausted&quot; ;UaB jiourCe. iri^acrariglag^fo* advanced to^Imperial;iiunitionsoiv^BtJard fo^-.June. .July i,hd  AujrusW  WearejativUcH  th*t-for05011^.4?) represents tho  bent wo can doin tho oiroumutanc&apos;.&apos;3.
