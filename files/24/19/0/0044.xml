Ministere- Do - la Guerre0, 67.&apos;  Republique Francaise4bis, Boulevard des&apos;Invalides,   .v  - &apos;    PARIS.&apos;.-:V&quot;   ,.:   ,&apos;. &apos;  : 7th July,  1917.    Dear General.    - //  &apos;-          &quot;V&quot;^/V;^&apos;/://:^v:&apos;:;:--.;/&apos;v;;      The foil owing  information concerning the /-^///t-:/    Secret Session may be of  interest; to you.1. &apos; &apos;.;;.: The - Chamber&quot; has not  yet  adopted .the Order&apos; of : the Vday.;.:    accepted by the Government, &quot;but&apos; there . is no doubt that;-; -   there will be ; a majority; for: the Government *2.   -  The Chamber, is not dissatisfied with the Government: i/:v; and. is..not likely to make :any attempt, at throwing it over,;;:;;;. The s it uat i on of the Secretary of St at e for War i se ems to..    be particularly good.                               /3.     Throughout the Session the whole tone of the Chamber/ &quot;    was clearly for  continuing the war; the feelers thrown&apos;    out by some extremists  fell flat.4.     After the public  Session, which is to follow the Secret    Session, it is likely that there will be some pretty    lively speeches by extreme socialists, l,e, it is quite    likely we  shall  hear It said by Deputies that the men were    perfectly right  in revolting in view of the criminal    incompetence  of  leaders,5,     The whole debate rolled on two main questions, viz         (a)  The Incompetence of Generals who took part              in the last offensive, andMajor-General F. Maurice, C.B.,      Director of Military Operations,          War Office,              London, S.W..1.
     ;;: (b)&apos;-. The--extens ion .of  the * Br it i sh f r ont     As regards  (a);   it  is  likely  that General  Nivelle,-and&apos;possibly other Generals, will have  to appear before a  Court of Inquiry presided  over by some senior  General- such as General  D1 Amade,   Mar shal Jof fre would probably;not  be: chosen as the Chamber - is extremely/jealousl ofhis&apos; enormously increasing  popularity throughout /the --&apos;; country.     Connected with this  question is the one of  Parliamen- . tary. contr ol  in  the- Army.  ,v;: It  is 1 ikely&apos;. that Tar 1 lamentary:representat ives, not only  of Par1iamentary  Committees  but;also of the War  Minister,&apos;.will be accredited to  armies .which  they will  visit  as  often as they please  with full&quot;authority to  examine in detail, any  service-  and also of - reading through, although  not  of criticising or  changing, operation plans  and Orders etcetera.    This measure, as can  well be  imagined,  is not likely to  be popular in the- Army and is  likely to  be  strenuously opposed by  General Petain; what will happen  I  cannot  say  save that the Government is likely to find itself fbetween the devil and  the deep  scaf with, on the one  hand, the Army deeply disgusted at  Parliamentary control  and,  on  the other hand,  a very  determined Chamber.     As regards  (b);   orators  of the left,  applauded by the  whole  Chamber,  pointed  out that  the  British had lost in total casualties 300^000 men as  against  1,300,000 French. It was  also pointed out that the age  limit for conscription  in&apos;England was  still only  41 years,  that                  .-&quot;           &apos;        &quot;          .. the
the British only held- 138 kilometres of front as;;&apos;.;against 475 kilometres held by the French.:  TheGovernment pointed out that relief by the Britishwould penalise their offensive power, but the Chamber;;as a whole, would not accept the statement, arguingthat the French had been able to carry out considerableoffensives whilst holding their present front.;:      Although this question will have to be dealt with,I do not believe it need bo dealt with before thenext;offensive;provided; that guarantees are giventhat the extens ion will eventually take place. ..      The Chamber on.the whole demands that the Britishshould take over 120 kilometres more front.          The general question affecting the war wastaken.into consideration, and it is probable that the -following measures will have to be taken before the l,:Winter if very serious trouble is tc be averted:      (a) The 3 oldest classes (1888, 1889 and 1890 -          and possibly 1891) will have t* be sent;back    &apos;.; ;;  owing to the needs cf agriculture -       : .      (b) Those miners still serving will have to be sent          back to the mines; and        ------     .,ky^^::&apos;-;.;;:    ; - (c) All skilled workmen will have to.be sent back          to the factories.      These measures are pretty well essential.:...;    ...  The Minister of the Interior will have tc takeenergetic measures tc stop anarchical propaganda in theInterior.      Possibly the most disquieting symptom of allwas that the Chamber was inclined to say - and applaud     - ,      ;;                 -     1             those/; : :;
those.; Deputies: who - did saythat In view of the Frenchlosses/and:of;the: general:exhaustion.of fthe countrythe -French Army could only, be expected to hold;a :defensivefronty leaving all considerable offensive action to.her U;?Allies,    ;. This point of view will&apos; no doubt carry some weight .with the Government,;but  I think that one can reasonably;;;say that it is likely ,that the temper of the Chamber:.willimprove provided;:there  are some military successes,-:/&apos;and that&apos;/;it will back a - Government taking a strong line&apos;;;::;;in sup port of it s Allies; but the signs of xie akne s s do notmake; the; task;of the French  Government an easy,one,   ---The.Chamber is quite determined that some of thegrievances rf. the Army are to be listened to, i,e, that&apos;;.the troops will have more rest than they have hithertohad, and that troops relieved from the trenches for the -&apos;.-purpose of rest will not be  expected to train; training  -will be reserved for those units especially withdrawnfrom the front for that purpose.                          Yours sincerely,                          (Sgd.)  E.L.Spiers.                                  Lt.-Colonel,                                   General Staff.
