   ... w   p. - GUN AMMUNITIOIT,: i^OCRAMIS - FOB .1918-,WITH SPECIAX RBFEREIICE TO CATO1M&apos; :SUP?HSS -;-, -          MEMORANDUM -BY, JM^MXglgSvPJ.-MlTOlfrNS,  Jg^Pf      have bedn in negptiation fpr  spme time past. with the War Office with reference  tq the gun ammunitioii programme fpr 1918.   A definite scheme  has how been  arrived; at and it is urgently nocessar^y th&amp;t instructions should bo given immediately if, the desired output  is to  be obtained. But before taking definite  steps there are certain points on which a decision is required from the War Cabinet.     B.   The programme for next, yoar is based uppn a gun establishment which shfiws .a,cghsiderable increase over the existing position.   But the  rmy Council  would be satisfied if the ammunitipn supply is, maintained fpr  thewhple  year at the rate per gun per day put forward last September in respect pf the current year.          Our forecasts show that wo shall be  ablo to supply and maintain these establishments of guns with some margin t9 spare though it is doubtful whether the surplus will reach in all natures the  25^  suggestedby the War Office.          The programme now put forward will permit of an expenditure during  the winter and summer of next yearwhich  compares as follows with recent experience     1916/

Assuming that ^programmes for all other   :      munitions remain:as at present* this general scheme will            :   X involve a monthly -shipment from Earth America;  of approximately    ;  300,000 tons a month,, of which nearly 100,000  tons will     /represent shell steel and forgings..

The  following points  are  submitted  forimmediate. decision: :  -,      (a)    V/ill financial- considerations  enable  us  to                 obtain the quantities proposed to be                 ordered in Canada?    If not,  to  what extent                -should these  orders be further reduced?                 Should the balance be ordered in the United                 States or at  home?      (b)    Is  it desirable at this moment to  approach  the              /United States Government  with a  view to                 obtaining permission  to order 100,000                 6&quot; shell  a week in that country? &apos;      (c)    It  is desired  to obtain the approval  of  the             ..  War Cabinet to a programme based on the                 assumption that approximately&apos; -the same                 tonnage will  be available for munitions in                 1918 as is now being  employed.

PABAPHBASS.,B.C.  454.  Following  message from Plavelle should he delivered to Minister personally. Begins.  A conference was  held on Tuesday on the  financial situation  at which were present Lever,  representing  the Treasury,  White  representing the Canadian Government,  Brand, Perry, Gordon and  myself.  On Wednesday Lever.  White and I had a further  conference  with  regard to  the July commitments of the Board, amounting  to$69,000)000.   The following  arrangementwas proposed:-      (1)   The Board will v-sk the Bank of  Montreal  for  a renewal for one month of the $10,000,000  loan due  July 15th.      (2)  White agrees to  charge1  to open  Treasury  accountinterest due io Government July 1st which was  included in ourestimate of commitments, thus  leaving us  only  the  interest  dueto the Bank to he paid hy us.      (3)  White agrees to advance to the Board  in  July the  sumof $40,000,000 hut states definitely that of this amount015,000,000 must be considered as an anticipation of theAugust advance of $25,000,000 in order to meet the temporarysituation.   The result  of this arrangement leaves a balance                                                         ofof $15,000,000 to be provided by the Treasury in July and/thisamount Lever has  promised to  pay $5,0uu,0C0 to-day.          The  above arrangement will meet  the immediate c.risi3but you will see  that it  is only achieved  by prolonging atemporary loan from the  1  :ik  of iiontreal which cannot beindefinitely/
  indefinitely extended and also by anticipation  of-our August advance Of $25,000,000 from the Canadian Government. Consequently in August we shall hare to find approximately $45,00 ),0u0 for our current expenditure and $10,000,000 to repay the Baalc of Montreal, or $55,000,000 in all. While/the anticipation this month of the regular Canadian Government August advance will reduce that advance to-; $10* 000,000 - next, month.           Lever has been asked by T7h.it e t6 return from VJashington and discuss  the  existing situation as soon as the future policy to be  followed: with regard to British and Canadian l-.-ans in the U.3.A.  is  more  clearly;defined. As matters now  stand, Vhite  states that he  cannot  promise to advance more than $25,000,000  per. month  at  the  very most while Lever  states. that he cannot  find.more than.  . $15,000,000 per month and both of them  request  that you should be  advised that as far  as  they are concerned they cannot, be  responsible for finding more  than  the  above sunper month.  Lever, I understand,  suggested that  Canadianpurchases  should be reduced  to this amount.  You will &apos;remember, however, that this $40,000,000 will have  tocover commitments not merely of munitions, but also  oxships, equipment and maintenance of inlying Corps Stations v;and purchases on;Russian  account,  aad apparently alsointerest on existing loans          It will be necessary if this sum of $40,000,000is  adhered to as a limit  to stop production of 9.2&quot; shellson  the balance . of existing contracts.-v-V-^iS:--wili/mee2i ,&apos;tnat -plants which have- now been amortised and which are
 consequently favourably placed, to continue production of these sizes of shell-at low cost will have to be dismantled. : Immediate steps will also have to be taken to reduce other  . output of shell components and explosives in one direction or another in order to bring.our total expenditure within the above mentioned limit.   I think it necessary, in view of the statements made by; White and Lever tft put: the whole position clearly before&apos;you.   From every point of view it seems unreasonable that the  output of our national and other plants which:is urgently required at the Front should be cut down  but  I presume that there  is no  alternative tft this  if neither the British nor Canadian Treasuries  can undertake  tf\ find  the necessary funds.  Of  course the situation would be relieved if the TJ.S.A.  Government  could  be /induced tp  take a more  liberal view  than  they do at  present gf the  extent  to which money can be- borrowed in the W.S.A. for  expenditure - in Canada.  It is, however, for the British and Canadian  Governments to determine whether the situation can be met by this  or any other means, Or whether as White and Lever at present suggest, our programmes must be cut down.             -        -.. Will you  consider the whole situation and inform uswhether you wish us to cut down our production and if so, indicatein what direction this production should be curtailed?          Since drafting the above I ha,ve learnt that cOi-imunica-tions have been passing between the British and CanadianGovernments on the subject of providing funds up to September 30thfor British Government expenditure in Canada and I hope that  theresult of theSe negotiations will be  favourable.  This however           \V;.&apos;yv,  ,                        after      ::-,:.does not affect the question  of production - o^- September  andwe cannot in any case  cut down production so as to affect ourexpenditure:/        .
expenditure very muck before, that date.  It  is therefore  mostimportant&apos;that we should know as soon aS possible what we areto:do in the matter.           .  ;               .   -I :&apos;The .
