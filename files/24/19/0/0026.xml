CONTROL OF PRICES AND SUPPLIES.  -   ..- -    Export  of Foodstuffs from America.-On June  29, Lord  Rhondda received  adeputation of American journalists,  and expressed the profound interest with whichhe was watching the final stages of American food legislation.   He  stated that whenthe Food  Administration  became part of the  American  Government machinery, allAllied  Food Ministries would be able to make arrangements for  the future, as regardsboth prices  and supplies, with  far greater  degree of.certah^. . He. added  that  heattached  great importance to the President&apos;s&apos;creation of an Export Council with: powerof embargo  on shipments.    Cereals. It was stated in  the  House of Commons  on July 4, that, at the FoodControllers  request,.an expert Committee were investigating all. questions relating tothe effect which the Government regulation flour has upon the -health of the com-munity.   The conclusion  so far is that, while bread made, from  this flour, whenproperly  baked, is  perfectly wholesome,  there are unavoidable  local variations in theflour used and in the methods of bread-making.   These points are receiving  constantattention.   . The Flour Mills Control Committee have made the following recommendations :-       (1) That  a  Committee should be appointed  to. deal  with the distribution of       -      flour mill offals in order to ensure their passing into the desired channels   .       .   of consumption.       (2) That they should be empowered  to take over all flour mills  of a  capacity   [&apos;         exceeding two sacks an hour, in place of the existing limitation of live             sacks an hour.                                          &apos; &apos;       (3) That the  necessary  expenditure be authorised for dealing with  potatoes             by a drying process which promises to  enable them to be kept for a             considerable period, so that they coidd be utilised, in due course, either             as vegetables or for potato flour for bread..&apos;.

Gd. per cwt. in Irish bacon  and 2s. per cwt;in English  Cheddar (new) cheese.   There  were also minor increases in the  prices bfEnglish  beef, Canadian bacon, and Danish butter, and a  small decrease in the priceof palm-kernel cake.  Grain and flour, Argentine mutton,-Irish butter, sugar, oil-seediand oil cake (other than palm-kernel cake) showed little or no change in price.  , ; :;vi:     As compared with a month  ago, nearly all the marked changes in prices are in adownward  direction.   English mutton, which shows  the greatest fall,  though stilldearer.by about 30s..per cwt. than in the  last week  of April,  is cheaper  by 26s.;-per
 cwt. than- in the last week of May, after the sharp rise which occurred -in- that month. Canadian bacon is cheaper by 1 L&apos;s.&apos; Qd. per cwt., Danish  bacon by&apos; 10s. Qd, per cwt!, and Irish butter by 9s. per cwt. ;  and there have  also been small reductions in the prices of Irish bacon, Danish and New. Zealand butter, country &quot;straight run&quot; flour, and. palm-kernel  cake.   The only article showing a marked  rise in price is. beef, English beef being dearer&quot; by 15s. Qd. per cwt., and Argentine chilled beef by 7s. Qd, per cwt.   Imported wheat shows an increase of Is. per quarter.  . An  increase of 8s. per quarter in the &quot; Gazette &quot; average price of British barley is due to  the inclusion of a greater proportion of kiln-dried  barley (the  price  of which is  relatively  high) among the recent sales,  and not to an increase in the price of grain of similar quality.. British  wheat and oats, town-made flour,  maize, rice,  Argentine; mutton,. sugar, oil&quot;seeds, and  oil-seed cake (other than palm-kernel cake) are practically unchanged in price.               v&apos;-.-;&quot;&apos;.:.&apos;.^&quot;&apos;:.v/.. &apos;.:v,      - .&apos;./     &apos;    &apos;: &apos;              -&apos; &apos;   ... With the exception of Argentine mutton, the price of  which is at about the same level, every article in the Table shows  a substantialrise in price  as compared with a- year ago, though, the amount of increase varies  widely for different  commodities. The rise is greatest in  the case of&apos; palm-kernel cake (145s. per ton, or 92  per cent.),&apos;. British. oats (24s.  3d.  per 312 lbs., or 79 per cent.), British wheat  (32s. per 480 lbs.&apos;,. or 69 per cent.), linseed cake (170s. per ton,  or  67 per cent.), and Calcutta linseed 1228s.  per ton,  or 61  per cent.).   Maize,  London  (town-made) flour,  rice,  and Egyptian  cotton-seed are dearer by between 50  and  60  per  cent.,  English and Argentine  beef,  English  mutton,  Irish  bacon,   and   palm-kernels  by  between.30. and 40 per cent., and Canadian bacon by 27  per cent.  Apart from Argentine mutton, the articles showing least  increase are Danish bacon (9s. per cwt., or 8  per cent.),  sugar (5s. l^d. to Qs. l\d.  per cwt.,  or  12 to 14 per cent.), and butter (26s. to 30s. per cwt., or 15.to 19 per cent.). ...       -    .  -
