A feeling atetn.to-despair has spread  among.-the  Serbian-forces, in/-  the-field -which form, the remnant- of - the. valid manhood..of-, the.--.  Serbian- nation; --by. the proposal: to withdraw- a; portion.- of - the.  British - contingent&quot; from the Salonika-  front and, generally,.by rthe, \..  failure ofr the Allied: Governments.-to  pursue,. with vigour and ..  singleness of mind., that restoration  of.-Serbia-. which ,the. Allies-.  have- repeatedly declared to be among  their, foremost:war; aims....       The Society is- convinced-that trie cause -of - Serbia,., like that-.  of  Belgium,,.is-a touchstone and- test-  of  the, sincerity of/Allied:.  . . professions.;;, and- that, unless Serbia be reinstated.in full inde-...  pendenee,. her: people indemnified for  their- sufferings and enabled.  to  join- with, the other, branches-of. the Southern-.Slav-race in a  united polity,..an -essential, war- purpo se  cf  this . country cannot,be  achieved&apos;.- . - The- Society there fore.fee Is  bound.-, to urge upon you-, .   /  as  the- responsible Head-- of.&apos; the British Governmentthe need, for-  taking;., with- all. despatch.,., steps: to reassure- and.: encourage- the ; &apos;.  S erbian Army&apos; and - people,,. and to aid. them - effectively - in.. securing  their&quot; incontestable- righW;     .  The: Serbian:Army,.; already ,terribly  reduced., by- the hardships.;;;;/  of the retreat through Albania;, and: the.: sufferings-, endured in -. ; Corfu.,-., has.-been used/as. the vanguard  of; the. Allied, forces.- in. the,.  Balkans-and&quot;- allowed:;;.without  adequate support,., to -bear the. brunt-.; of the fighting:on the.Monastlr:- front.,.,  l:t. is  now- so reduced; in  .  strength that;- l%s effectivesscarcely exceed, a. single, division... . The feeling; of bitterness among the officers  and: men-has-been, i;;:/  -..: intensified.- by knowledge-  that the Allies:-, have- done nothing towards  the.r evictualling of Serbia,, and that: their  families;   especially.. in  townsare in a- state of/ destitution^:
      In these circumstances it is not surprising that despair Should spread in the Serbian ranks;: . and the Society feels bound: to convey to you, with, all the earnestness It can command, its sense of the gravity of the situation that would arise, should further, disaster befall the Serbian.cause *   Not only would. gallant people have been utterly sacrificed by.its more powerful;; Allies;  not only would the Great Alliance have proved powerless to attain one of its chief purposes; ;but vital interests of the Ailied peoples and in particular cf  the British Commonwealth, would have, suffered grievous andj indeed, irreparable hurt.  What should be the. strongest-barrier .against the -Prussor- Austrian design of mastery over the Near and Middle  East would have disappeared.-.;      Honour and interest, alike)  therefore, demand that the1 British Government should take in. hand.without delay the work of succouring&apos;the.Serbian Army and)  as  far as possible, the Serbian. people.   The Society is convinced that, to this;end, the reorganization of the-Allied Army based ,on Salonika should be &apos; put in hand forthwith, full&apos;advantage being taken of the exceptiona&apos; knowledge, which the Serbian General&quot;Staff possesses of the con- v. ditions -of- Balkan fighting.   Recent;events in Greece have cleared the, way..   There is strong reason -to: believe, that were the British Government now to show whole-hearted interest in the Balkan Campai^ most of the difficulties hitherto existing would be overcome.     ; In conclusion,-the- Society ventures to draw your attention to:the opportunity offered -by the Russian proposal, for the revision :- of Treaties -vwith the except iorr^f&quot;irfte--%^; the^rurop^ean.treat^^-engagements of the Allies into harmony with the declared policy of the Alliance.-   Beyond question,; the Convention concluded with Italy In April, 1915 and,. even, the Treaty with Roumania of August, 1916,&apos; infringe the principle of nationality to. the; detriment or Serbia&apos;and Of the Southern -Slavs..  The Society -is. in. complete - sympathy&apos; w 1th the  desire of - our - Italian and Roumania Allies to&apos;recover*from&quot;Austria-Hungary&apos; unredeemed regions inhabited by-majorities of their own race.   &quot;it is also convinced that a clos and;; just agreement between Italy, Serbia and the Southern Slavs generally in regard to the Adriatic, would bo to the interest&apos; of all parties.   Therefore the Society; urges;the British Government;--to:; promote this agreement;  w                                  -           &apos;   &apos;:       We have the honour to be, Sir,   .
