Dear Colonel Hankey,

                   Some time ago we appointed Mr. H.G. Burgess to represent this Ministry in Ireland and to have charge there of the Cross Channel transportation.

I asked him to send us at his convenience a Memorandum giving particulars of the Irish 1917 Harvest expected requirements and I think the enclosed paper will be gratifying to the Prime Minister. Without troubling him to read the details it shows that about 400,000 extra acres are growing oats and it is calculated the produce will be 340,000 tons. 150,000 extra acres are growing potatoes and it is expected will produce about 750,000 tons. The remaining 200 acres are growing barley, wheat, rye, etc. The letter shows that Mr. Burgess anticipates the extra tillage will produce a total of 1,400,000 tons food more than Ireland over had before. He calculates that we will have to arrange for the rail and water transport of 1,000,000 additional tons from Ireland.

The quantity of oats should reduce considerably our oversea needs which will be a decided help in the tonnage position.

                                                         Yours faithfully,

                                                         (Signed) J.P. MACLAY.

                               more      With., the view of pro&amp;ucing/food the Irish Agricultural Boardarranged that for the year Id 17..-ten per cent additional landShould be cultivated -representing 750,000 acres extra.   Of thisabout 400,000 acres are growing Oats; and it is calculated theproduce will be 340,000 tons, 150,000 ac?es are growing potatoes  .and will produce about 750J0O0 tons.   The remaining 200,000acresare growing barley, a small proportion wheat and rye, vegetables,turnips and other root crops.      In addition the very numerous Garden etc Blots put intocultivation to grow potatoes,  vegetables, etc. by private people,labourers,  etc must be taken into account,  but, as no statisticsare available, it is impossible to make any reliable calculation:I feel safe, however,.. in saying 25,000 acres are not an exaggera-tion.     &quot;All this increased tillage will, I am convinced, produce1,400,000 tons of food more than Ireland ever had before, and Lwill now endeavour to arrive at the weight that will be availablefor transport.      As I have shown, in normal years the food under the headingsenumerated,  produced in Ireland, supported the population, andleft very substantial quantities for export.      This year, when the garden plots, etc are taken into account,and with a reduced population, owing to the number of people inthe Army, and at other *?ar work in Great Britain, less than thenormal production of foodstuffs will bo sufficient;  but of coursewe have to bear in mind all the time that more stringent exigenciesexist this year which may, and likely will,  vary the usual conditionsPreviously for instance;, considerable quantities of Oil Cake,  Bran,Pollard and Other animal feeding stuffs were imported into Ireland;also wheat,  maizej flour etc. for human food.      On account of the existing abnormal state of things the  fore-going commodities may not be available in such quantities, if atall, and, in this event they must be replaced by a proportion ofthe Irish crops, leaving less for export.   In addition it mustbe remembered that a good deal depends on the conditions underwhich the harvest will be saved,  i.e.                     1. State of weather.                     2. Labour available.                     3. Stacking and storing.However, after most carefully considering all the points - proand con, I have no hesitation in stating that shipping provisionwill be necessary for the export of at least 1,000,000 additionaltons, out of normal and extra crops, made up principally ofpotatoos and oats. .      At present it is impossible to say over what period theexportation will spread.    On account of tho Government havingfixed minimum prices for oats, etc.  farmers  will probably endeavourto get rid of the crops as soon as they are  ready,  but I anticipatethat the Agricultural Board will regulate the deliveries in themost effective way; and possibly be able to  spread the shipmentsfrom September 1917 to April or May 1918* provided of course thatthe commodities are not wanted in Great Britain within a shorterperiod.      We have, therefore, to arrange for the rail and water transit .of 1,000,000 additional tons.  The  depleted  regular services betweenIreland and  Great Britain (roughly  speaking  35 per  cent)  will  befully occupied dealing with normal traffic,  consequently extrashipping will be required.for the extra 1^000,000 tons.    No doubttransit will be required to  France  as well as to Great Britain, and
