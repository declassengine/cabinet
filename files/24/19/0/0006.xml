ciliated by the Secretary of State for India.   I circulate  a  telegram from the Viceroy, dated 29th June 1917, on thesubject of the extension of the Quetta-Nushki-Dalbandin Railway to Mirjawaon  the Persian frontier.   Subject to the  approval  of the .War  Cabinet,I recommend acceptance  of  the  Government of Indias  proposal.  I havesent a copy of this Minute to the Chief of Imperial General Stall:.                                                                AC   5th July 1917.            From Viceroy, Army Department, 29th June 1917. &apos;    9614.   Our whole political and strategical position  has  been altered byrecent events in Russia.  The internal dissensions of Russia and the reportsas to the result of antagonistic inefficiency of her armies lead us to apprehenda renewal  of a German-Turkish  movement on Tehran as  well as progresseastwards towards Afghanistan of organised hostile bodies.    Secondly.&apos;  The unstable political conditions of Persia, the military failureof  Russia,  and  the  reported  nomination  of Mackensen, Falkenhayn forcommands  to  Asia Minor and  Mesopotamia, wrilT make this hostile projectmore formidable than the last attempt under Zeiler ;  while  on this occasionwe may have to guard the Perso-Afghan frontier  single handed.    Thirdly.  The status  of the  above factors will re-act to  Our disadvantagein the region for which South Persian Rifles are responsible.    Fourthly.  Consequent on above, we recommend  extension westward ofDalbahdin  railway in  order that (a) we may  be in a position .to develop  andmaintain military strength in and northwards of Seistan, thereby threateningthe movement of enemy detachments towards Afghanistan, and  denying tothem Seistan as a rendezvous and base ;  (b)  from Seistan wre could  threatenthe flank of enemy detachments southwards towards Helmand, thus  limitingtheir advance towards our border  to the longer and more difficult Hari Rudand Daolat Yar Road ; and the presence of our troops in Seistan will have asteadying effect on Afghanistan ;  (c) support can be better afforded to SouthPersian Rifles in the Kerman  province, thereby  covering the Baluchistanfrontier.    Fifthly.  For the present these  considerations  are  met by extension toMirjawa on the Persian frontier, via Isa  Takir Nok  Kundi, a route whichcommends  itself on strategical,  political, and technical grounds.    Cost of  construction is roughly estimated at 176 lakhs, which will fall  onIndian revenues, and  will form an addition to  the  current year&apos;s railwayprogramme.    Sixthly.  Our present commitments  in  railSsupply to  oversea  theatreswill be completed by September, and we request sanction,.to recommencework  on the extension  from Dalbandin westwards to Mirjawa as soon asweather is favourable.  If new rails are then required  overseas,  we&quot; shouldbe prepared to lift the rails from existing Indian  systems.   We ask for earlyreply.
