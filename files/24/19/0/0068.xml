 SECRET.. G.T. 1367, HWllTl hIikTiii II&quot;&apos; If                       WAR CABINET.      PROVISION OF MATERIAL FOR REPAIR OF ROLLING STOCK,. - -  (Copy of letter from Sir A.. Stanley to Sir Ji. Hankey.)                                        10th July, 1917. Dear. Sir Maurice Hankey.,       At the meeting :of the .War Cabinet -: this morning, con- eideration  was given to the Report  on Shipbuilding Situation prepared by the Controller* s Department, Admiralty, and I: believe it  was decided that a small Committee should be set up to consider and recommend to the War Cabinet what action should be taken...  At the -meeting I  -raised the question about the railways., pointing out that unless -they received the ;v. necessary material for the -repair of the rolling stock a serious break down would inevitably occur in the near future. I fear that this statement did not  reoeive the attention which it demands, and I suggest that when the Committee referred to -has been astablished this matter should be considered by -that Committee,  what the Controller is asking for would if agreed to without taking into account the needs of the railways.,, create a situation that would make the problem &amp;f inland transport just as serious as that confronting us with regard to our merchant service, and I trust you will take steps to ensure that the Committee  is instructed to see that due consideration is given to this  grave problem, and-that it is included in their recommendations to -the ;Cabinet.                                      Your sincerelyj                                        (Sgd.)  A, H, STANLEY,.
