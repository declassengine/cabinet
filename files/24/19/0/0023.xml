129Intelligence Bureau,Department of&apos;Information.B\f-:A/008.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary.  VIII.(7th July,  1917.)     There is less sign than ever of a detente in the internalsituation.   The rival racial groups,  so far from showing anyreadiness to compromise, are re-stating their demands with addedtmphasis.   Meanwhile there are olear indications that thesituation - coinciding as it does with the long-delayed Russianoffensive - is viewed with genuine alarm by leading circles inGermany.     The Amnesty.    U&amp;at is in many ways the most remarkableevent of the past week - the amnesty accorded by the EmperorCharles to those sentenced for political offences - is, accordingto reliable information whioh has reached the Czech NationalCouncil in Paris from Switzerland, due to pressure exercisedby the German military chiefs, who visited the Austrian G.H.Q.at Baden near Vienna as recently as the 2nd July.   If this hetrue, it merely tends to confirm what has long been obvious tocareful observers - namely, that the attitude of the Germansof the Empire towards the Czechs is distinctly less intransigentthan that of the Germans of Austria.   Quite apart from Friedrichflaumann and kindred apostles of  &quot;Central Europe1, there is asection even of the Pan-Germans in Germany which (in contrastto Reventlow and the extreme Conservative wing) has longadvocated a conciliatory attitude towards the Western Slavs andthe Czechs in particular.   These people are sufficiently far-sighted to realise the tremendous strength of the nationalmovement in Bohemia and the danger to Germany of the geographical
position of the Czechs.   They therefore would welcome a com-promise with the Czechs and endeavour to exercise a moderatinginfluence upon the Pan-German Empire, in the event of the Czechsooming into their own.   This would not of course suit any onewho still believes in the Bismarok tradition of discouraging theunion of the German-Austrians with the German Empire on the groundthat they were of infinitely greater service to Germany by remain-ing inside Austria-Hungary and thereby, with Magyar help, keepingit within the orbit of Germany.     It is not yet blear whether Dr. Kramarz has been excluded fromthe amnesty.   It is in any case difficult to sec how the returnof the other imrpisoned Slav leaders can modify the politicalsituation.   Tho strong line hitherto taken by parties deprivedof their best leaders, is the best proof of the strength of feelingamong their constituents, and the return of these leaders mayactually have the effect of stiffening and encouraging them stillfurther.     Tho Budget.    The Seidler ministry was quite favourablyreceived by Parliament, and the new Premier at once emphasised theprovisional oharaoter of his tenure of office.   After an un-constitutional gap of three years the Budget has been passed by theHouse: but this Is not to be regarded as a special triumph of theconstitutional principle, but rather as a device to conceal thenakedness of the land.   Voices have been raised in the Viennesepress against the mystery in which the essential facts of thefinancial situation were shrouded; but the deputies,  perhaps notunnaturally, appear to have preferred to give a perfunctoryapproval rather than insist on an effective control which wouldalmost certainly have been denied them.     Dr. Seidler and the Czechs.    Among: the speeches whichgreeted Ritter von Seidler&apos;s first appearance as Premier in the
 House,  special reference must &quot;be mads to  those of  certain  Czech deputies.   Mr. Stanek, as head of the Czech Parliamentary Club, declared that tho Clam system, which was  hostile to  the Czechs, had not been altered in any way. by the creation of a Cabinet  of officials, and that no government will have the support of the Czeohs  which does not work for the democratisation of Austria and the right of self-determination for all nations.   Even more remarkable was the speech of Baron Prazek, one of  the most influential Czechs in HSravia and a Privy Councillor and ex- Cabinet Minister.   He declared that the  Czechs could only support a government which adopted as its programme the abolition  of  theDual System and the erection of self-governing States in its  place. Referring to the Magyars&apos; insistence upon historic rights  in  the Slovak  question, he thanked God that neither they  nor any  one could arrest the democratic and national  current in  the world of to-day.   A well-known clerical Czech deputy, Father Zahradnik, spoke with equal frankness.   Baron Prazek&apos;s speech, owing to his high standing and to the fact that he was one. of the ministers who concluded the last oommercial Ausgleich with Hungary,  has naturally caused a great sensation in Vienna and Budapest.    The speech  of the Hungarian Premier (of which a very brief summary is reported in a Reuter telegram of yesterday) is  evidently an answer  to such pronouncements.   In it Count Esterhaz  declares that the question of nationalities must be regulate!  by Austria and Hungary separately, and that neither government will ever  tolerate any interference with Hungary&apos;s historical unity,   on the national lines of self-determination advocated by  the Entente.     The Financial Outlook.    The Daily Telegraph announces  from New York that American financial experts regard Austria&apos;s  decision to pay  interest on its goldbesring bonds  in paper  crowns at a discount of 60 per cent as equivalent to a confession of bankruptcy.
     The Emperor Charles has paid a flying visit of a day toMunich: and the fact that Count Czernin accompanied him is widelycited as a proof that the visit related to the question of peace.A third visit of the Emperor William to Vienna is announced.     It is impossible to attempt any estimate of Austrian andHungarian views upon Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s recent speech until theVienna and Budapest newspapers of this week arrive.     Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.     The MOrning Post correspond-en$ in Berne announces that in diplomatic circles there Bulgariais believed to be dissatisfied with Austria-Hungary owing toCount Czernin&apos;s readiness to accept the idea of &quot;no annexations&quot;.Bulgaria, it is alleged, received definits pledges when she enteredthe war that she would be allowed to retain about half Serbia, thewhole Dobrudja and part of eastern Greece.   The Bulgarian govern-ment is said to have handed in a protest to its allies against the&quot;no annexations&quot; idea.   If this is correct, it would no doubtaccount for the continual emphasis laid by the Bulgarian Premier,Dr.  Radoslavov, in a whole series of interviews in the Austrianpress,  upon the vital need for a oommon frontier between Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.   On the other hand it might have beenexpected that if his insistence on this point had been really dis-tasteful to Count Czernin,  some mfians would have been found toprevent the publication  of these interviews in the officialFremdenblatt.  the semi-official PesterLloyd and a paper with suchofficial leanings as tho Neue Freie Presse.     The Riots in Budapest.    In Hungary the main incident of theweek has been an outburst of rioting in Budapest on an altogetherunprecedented scale.   On 27 June at a few Hours&apos;  notice over15,000 workmen assembled in the industrial suburbs and marchedinto the centre of the city,  to demonstrate for UniversalSuffrage and against Count Tisza and his party.    The newMinister of the Interior,  according to his own statements in
if&apos;^^art.iamentv appealed to ^1^-leaders of&quot; the workmen to stop the procession, and when informed that this was too late, merely tried to divert it from the centre of the-city.   He ordered 300 police and 60 mounted polioe to guard the premises of the Club of National Work (Tisza&apos;s party), but the Chief of Police disregarded the order: and after the majority of the demonstrators had dispersed in an orderly fashion, about 2,000 hooligans were left free to play havoc in streets which correspond to Oxford Street and Brompton Road. Many valuable shops were looted, about 200 cafes smashed, and Tisza&apos;s Club stormed and wrecked.   The damage is estimated at  $0,000. The police seem to have been quite powerless: in the halting phrase of the Minister of the Interior, &quot;I don&apos;t know whether perhaps the blame lies with the disorganisation of the police&quot;.   Their inaction, and the failu&amp;e of thoir ohief  (who has been dismissed)  is in such marked contrast to their pr^ious record, that it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the outburst was diverted by hidden forces,I It would however be going too far to accept the rival insinuations that the government wished to intimidate the Tisza party or that an intrigue of the Tisza party  to reveal the government&apos;s weakness recoiled on its own head, or that the whole affair was intendedHto bring disoredit on  the Suffrage movement.      Such an event is  a clear evidence of acute unrest,  and this is freely admitted by  the Magyar press.   But it seems certain that  franchise reform rather than peace was the ruling motive of the mob:  and this will not surprise any  one who has followed  the  history Ijof the Suffrage movement, which has dominated Hungarian  political  llife since 1905 for  the excellent reason that on its solution the  piole future of tho Magyars and of Hungary rests.    The  movement  fas however obviously  acquired  added force from the  sufferings  paused by  the war and  from the  hope that reform will finally   :iin the clique who  made the war and prepare the way for democratic   s&amp; peace-loving forces.
[       The  riots  are  almost  certain  to&apos; have weakened the new govern-  ment,  and have  of course also  increased  the tension &quot;between  its  followers and Tisza&apos;s majority.                                      R.W.S.W.  Note.     As  an  example of  the  danger of  relying upon news from  Austria in the  British press,  I ought to point out that the  Herr Mattaja to whom I referred to in my last report as the  solitary  politician in a Cabinet of officials, turns out to be  not the Christian Socialist deputy of that name, but yet another  departmental chief  in one  of the ministries, of no special  importance.   Thus  my statement that the Seidler ministry was  politically  colourless, must be made absolute.
