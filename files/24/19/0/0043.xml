                          SECRET.                                     General Headquarters,                                          Home  Forces,                                        1     Horse Guards,                                                London,  S,W,H.F.CR,  5764 (A.A.)         -                                             6th July,. 1917.      The Chief  of the  Imperial General Staff,      ^__WAR  OFFICE.___;              With reference to your memorandum No. 79/9710, dated      July 5th,  1917.              The  two  squadrons recently placed under my orders have      now been withdrawn.                                         :&apos;              Apart from the slower machines which have  neither the      climbing power  nor speed sufficient  to make them  effective      against such machines  as the  enemy may be expected to employ3v  -   the means  at my disposal to repel aeroplane attack are as&apos;..  -   follows : -        .:  -  .                        12  Sopwith Scouts.                          o  S . iii .5....                        -                       ____6_D.Ii. 4.                Total    21         In addition there are two war aeroplanes at LYMPNSbut,because of the distance these are not&apos; immediatelyavailable for the defence,&quot;of London.         I desire to place on record my most emphatic opinionthat even with the addition of 12 Sopwith Scouts, which it Ishoped will be available by the 15th instant, the&apos; aeroplaneswhich I can dispose of are not sufficient for effective actionagainst raids in force.          Such raids may certainly be expected, and if Londonis again subjected to attack the results may be disastrous.          Tho situation, as I have stated here, is quite clear;at the same time if you desire to discuss the questionpersonally I shall bo glad to see you here.                     (Signed)  FRENCH.                              Field Marshal,                       Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces.
