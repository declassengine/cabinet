v\       The British Government cannot undertake to repatriate.such persons If captured afoer ohe date of the Relevant agreed^ent,but will favourably consider the cases of all iihose whom theynow hold.       The German delegates declared that as far as British civildoctors of med-.cine and ministers of religion are similarlydetained in Germany their cases will receive similar considera-lion.2 *   Further  ejsatri at ion of civilians and their internment in     neutral oo&quot;unon j.es.           J      &apos;   &apos;&quot;y -       The delegates will recommend to their respective Govern-ments to give their benevolent consideration to the question ofthe further repatriation of civilians, and to the question oftheir further internment in neutral countries;  especially inthe cases of those detained in tropical climates or under otherunfavourable conditions.     Youthful Pr1soner s.       General Frisdrich declares that subject to reciprocitythose&apos; British subjects who are youthful and who  are captives inGerman hands, shall be  separated from the rest of the prisonersOf war and put in a separate block in one camp by themselves.-They shall be kept away from all unfavourable influences towhich they might be SJ ejected by being brought in contact withadult prisoners of war.   Their further education and lnstruc-tion shall also be provided for.4*   M?iL?Lspeedy, trial of Combatant Pr/isoners of War,-       The British delegates having intimated that Informationhas reached His Majestyrs Government from time to time that thetrial of Prisoners of War in German camps has frequently onlytaken place after long delay and that the prisoners have in themeantime been kept in custody, General Frfedrich informed theDelegates that such occurrences were not in any way in order andhe stated that as soon as he returned to Berlin he would expresslyInstruct the different commands to take such stops as wouldprevent the occurrence of similar delays in the future.--                   ,  .

                                   The Hague,  June 28th 1917.5*   Punishment^of Prisoners of War. Remission of Punishments.1.   The British delegates desire to represent to the Germandelegates the desirability of an agreement being concludedbetween them on the lines approximating as closely as possible tothat arranged between the 3?rer,eb and German Governments wherebyall sentences inflicted for offences committed prior to the1st September 19L6 v;ere remitted until the conclusion ofhostilities.   An agreement on precisely similar lines is, how-eyer, owing to the limitations of disciplinary powers allowableunder the British military ooda, impracticable.               :     The British delegates therefore suggest that every combatantprisoner of war held by either State., of whatever rank, shall ona date to be agreed upon between the British and German Govern-ments, be released from any form of imprisonment, detention,punishment, or restrictions, which may have been inflicted uponhim for any crime or offence whatever committed during hisinternment and prior to the date agreed upon, and that the re-&apos;mainder of his punishment shall be remitted from that date.  Anyprisoner who benefits under this agreement will be exempt from  .any special restrictions other than those v/hich are applicableto all prisoners of war and will be equally eligible with themfor all benefits they may enjoy, including repatriation andinternment in Switzerland,     It has been a satisfaction to the British delegates toobserve the favourable reception accorded by the Sermandelegates to this proposal at the meeting ef the 26th June. TheBritish delegates were moved to make their proposal largely byreason of the number of heavy sentences hitherto inflicted onmany British prisoners&apos; in Germany far beyond any imposed, forsimilar offences in England.  These sentences have excited muchfeeling in England and the Delegates express the hope thatthey are now things of the past.2,   The British delegates assume that all idea  which the.German, delegates may have had that prisoners of war, whethercombatant or civilian, who attempt to escape, are subjectedto additional penalties by reason^of their falling into thehands of the civil power has been,removed by the explanationgiven on the subject at the meeting of the 26th June.The Hague, June 30th 1917.      The German delegates have heard with -interest the Declara-tion of the British Delegates of the 28th June from which it.appears desirable that an. understanding should be arrived at &apos;on the subject of the remission of the punishments of Britishand German prisoners of war.    They entirely agree with theview of the British delegn&amp;fee and have willingly complied astar as possible in this direction with their proposals.  Bythe understanding thus reached the point seems to be settled in
a satisfactory manner.     As far as concerns the punishment of German prisoners ofwar who have endeavoured to escape, the German Delegates haveno hesitation, after the explanation given by the British Dele-gates at the sitting of the 26th June, in confirming that thesupposition expressed at the end of the declaration of the 28thJune is correct.                                    The Hague, July 2nd 1917..6.  Parcels,     Various questions were raised relating, to the delay whichhas taker; place in the delivery of parcels, especially toprisoners in the labour camps throughout Germany, and in theoccupied districts.  This delay appears to be largely attribu-t&amp;ble to excessive censorship, some parcels before reachingtheir dsstlnation having been censored as often as three times.     General Friedrich explained that the delays in the deliveryof parcels at the oamps in Germany and the strict censorshipwhich is being exercised on parcels was due to the discovery inmany cases of articles of sabotage which had been enclosed in  .parcels addres.3ed to prisoners of w^r in Germany.     General Friedrich further stated that the wishes a  theBritish Delagates had already been met to a certain extent, andthe British delegates having stated that they saw great objectionto such practices and strongly deprecated them, General Fried-ricli suggested that the British Government should publish in theBritish and especially in the neutral press a statement that theincluding of articles of sabotage in the parcels&apos; addressed tocombatant and civilian prisoners of war la deprecated and dis-approved&apos; by the Government as being contrary to the (interestsof the whole -body of prisoners of war, General Friedrieh statingthat he &quot;jould simultaneously. publish a corresponding declarationon behalf of the German Government.     By these means it would be posBible to give full satisfac-.tion to the wishes of the British Delegates.     In order to give a guarantee for a corresponding actionGeneral Friedrieh&apos;proposes that both Government communicateto each other the&apos; text of their publications.  As soon as GeneralFriedrich approves the British text, he will communicate tothe British Government the text he proposes to publish, for theirapproval.   As soon as the two Governments have arrived at anagreement on the text of both announcements, as far as possibleby telegram, the declaration shall be published by both sideson the same date agreed upon by telegram.    General Friedrieh then stated that he had given instructionsbefore leaving Germany that parcels for prisoners in working campswere to be censored only at those camps,  save In exceptionalinstances where no :possibility of localcsnsorship existed
in which cases the parcels would he censored at the parent campbefore, &quot;being sent to their destination as far as possibleundamaged.:  He -added that as the result of his conversationwith.the British delegates this would be the  practice in thefuture.   General Friedrich also stated that these parcelswere  how delivered in the working camps in occupied districtsas freely as in the camps in German^, and that in these campsthe same privileges of correspondence would be permitted to   -the prisoners ao in other canps.   Special cases of exoessii-ecensorship, which would load to the deterioration of the goods  &apos;would be enquired into and avoided as much as possible in future
