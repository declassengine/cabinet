               Before  dealing with  the  sudden crisis which arose    in Berlin at the end  of last week,  it will be convenient to       j    refer to  other eventB which proceeded, and in part, explain it.1,             There has, as is well-known,  for long been strong    pressure,  not only from the Socialists,  but also from the    liberal Parties, in favour of Constitutional Reform,  $he an-    peror, in his &quot;Easter message&quot;, premised that reforms would be    introduced in tho  Prussian franchise;  this at the time had a    good effect,  but the  pronounced opposition of the Conservatives    to any ohange continued, and in the proceedings of the Constitu-   j    tional Committee of the Reichstag,  there was a noticeable want of    ready cooperation  by  the Government representatives;  all this    has created a feeling that the  reform would be long delayed and                  -              .                                    .. I    would perhaps not  come to much;  the uneasiness of the liberals    has been  increasing.  A new phase was introduced by the decisive  j    attitude  assumed by Scheidemann on  his return from Stockholm    (see last report),  and during the last week the demand seems to    have hardened;  the language usod became more imperative, and it&apos;    is noticeable that it has won support among men who, though more    Intelligent and of wider political  cutlook than the ordinary    Prussian  Conservative, have hitherto identified themselves with    the action of the  Conservative  Party-appeal to the Government to take speedy measures for the oarry-ing out of electoral reforms in Prussia,has been issued by a num-ber of leading German Conservatives,  among whom are: Prof.  EmilFischer, Prof. Ba$jDsStetofc, Herr l^minious,  Chief Burgonaster,Prof.4dolf aarnaofe, P*&amp;e Frie&amp;rioh Meinco&amp;s, (fount von Monts, for.assCty .

   Dr. Friedrich Thimme, and Professor Ernst Troeltsch.   The   -   appeal says:-                                &apos;-,;,      &quot;The&quot; gigantic -struggle in which the German people is en-    gaged is not yet ended.    The undersigned have hitherto    been of opinion that the promises contained in the Imper-    ial Easter message could be&apos; carried out, without too hard    an internal struggle,  in collaboration with the conserve-    tive forces in our public life.    The resistance,  however,    from those quarters is so strong that doubts must arise    as to the full realisation of the Easter mossage in its    present spirit after the conclusion of peace.   Such a    doubt is today unbearable.   To  maintain that faith with    the German people to which it is entitled,  it is necessary    to get to work without delay,    Se therefore do not hesi-    tate publicly to emphasise the demand of the hour, namely,    that the German Government shall forthwith lay before the    Dower,Chamber.of. the Prussian Diet franchise reforms which    shall contain provisions not only for a general, direct    and secret, but also for an equal, franchise, and that the    Government shall, in addition, give effective and definite    expression to the confidence which the German people    deserve.&quot;           We may also note  as a sign of the times that PrinceLjichnowsky has written an article in the Berliner Ta^eblattaavosating constitutional changes and criticising unfavourablythe autocratic powers which  the Chancellor practically enjoys.           Numerous other indications could be  quoted, for in-stance, Herr Demburg, the late Colonial Minister, writing inthe Berliner Tagoblatt of July 7th,  says;       &quot;We stand on the platform of  the Easter message which     gave true, brave and highly developed people the  confi-     dence which it deserves, and because of this, we  demand     reform, and we trust that the Chancellor will speedily     carry it through.   Ho  shadow of doubt should be  allowed     to creep in between Crown and people/and no half measures     will avail that would offer a stone in place of bread.&quot;           Then we have an important article in the Frankfurter,the chief Liberal paper, on Friday 6th,  which is almost in thenature of a call to arms;   it says that tho refusal of the Con-servatives to cooperate in the Reform movement  has cleared thesituation and shows that there can no longer be any prospect ofa compromise with them.   The choice is now between no reform atall or a complete reform,  carried out by cooperation between theGovernment and the Democratic parties of the land;  it is nolonger possible to get a majority in the Reichstag which keeps
  in touch with the Eight.   Secondly the reform, it insists,  must be carried out at once.   Parliamentary Government could  not be won by determining on it, it must be aohieved by an act.            How, though it is of course not openly avowed, except  in the more extreme socialist and liberal press, there is no  doubt that the agitation owes much of its strength to the grow-  ing want of confidence in the conduct of the war, the uneasiness  aroused by the repeated diplomatic failures, and the very grave  apprehension which the entry of America has caused in business  circles.   We know that there is increasing doubt as to the  effectiveness of the submarine war to bring about peace before  America is able to unfold her strength; no doubt the sudden and  unexpected Russian offensive has added to the general nervous-  ness;  there is the most serious anxiety as to the condition of  Austria.   The repeated diplomatic fiasooes, as the failure to  profit by the Russian Revolution, the unfortunate Mexican inci-  dent, the rupture with America, the new difficulties with Norway,  the Hoffmann-Grimm episode,ooming in such rapid succession, have&apos;  made a very bad impression, and they cannot have failed to arouse  qualms as to whether the whole war itself wit not in reality its  origin in incapacity similar to that of v/hich there is new such  clear evidence.            The demand for democratic reform is in fact inextri-  cably connected with the desire for a speedy peace, a peace which  would have to be an agreed peace &quot;without annexations&quot;,  as con-  trasted with the &quot;German peace&quot; of the militarists.            It was then quite clear that the meeting of the  Reiohstag could not pass without strong expression being given  to these feelings.
           So much as to public opinion.   As to the policy ofthe Government, there was the usual uncertainty;  there hadbeen increasing irritation at the refusal of the Chancellorto make any definite statement as to war-aims;  the papershave been full of inconsistent reports as to his relationsto the military and as to the relations between Germany andAustria..   The latest indication as to the official view is astatement, which was issued on July 2nd, by Hindenburg:-     nThe war is won for us if we hold our ground against the   enemy until the submarine war has accomplished its work.   Our boats are doing good work and are destroying, to a   greater extent than we thought, the vital conditions of   the enemy.  -.&apos; At a date not very far distant, our enemies   will be forced to make peace.   They know this and there-   fore, in spite of the heavy defeats suffered by them on the   Isonzo, in the Tyrol, on the Aisne and near Arras, during   the spring, they must continue their attacks even though   they be as hopeless as those were    They can no longer   wait for the help of the Americans, but must come on.  The   Allied armies are not to be beaten.   Thejt will rebuff our   enemies until they perceive that we have won the war; then   will Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria obtain the peace   which is requisite for the free development of their strength.   The enemy has underestimated us, he has faith in his super-   iority from a numerical point of view and thinks that priva-   tions will induce us to consent to a peace destroying our   future and that of our descendants.   I wish enemy statesmen   could have the same, insight into the Monarchy as I have re-   cent ly had, and then they would dosist from their intentions.   1 retain from my visits the unshakeable conviction that we   shall remain together until the glorious end.   Our Alliance   is not to be shaken.   The Governments, armies,  and every one   of the people of Germany and Austria-Hungary, are ready to   stand firm for the common welfare to the very utmost, come  -what may.&quot;           So &amp;r as this goes, it tells the nation that they canbe satisfied with the progress of the war, they can depend onthe continued cooperation of Austria, and on the submarines,  and :implies a definite refusal to agree to a demand for &quot;peace with-out annexatiens or indemnities&quot;.   If this was to be taken as anofficial decision of the Government, it must inevitably lead toan explosion.   Wo must remember, moreover,  that it is quite  pos-sihle that the Chancellor did not share the views expressed bythe military authorities and that he himself would welcome any-
   thing that  would strengthen his hands against  the militarists   and the  Conservatives;   there can also he no reasonable doubt   that the Austrian Government  have been urging  the pressing ne-   cossity  of  an  early peace  and that  they would  be very  seriously   concerned if the German  Government  refused  to  be influenced by   their remonstrances.   This statement by Hindenburg would  then   inevitably,  compel the more moderate parties to bring the whole   question to a  speedy issuo.   The essential  point is given  by   the VorwSrts;         &quot;The  parting of ways has acme; the country must  be        governed  in one direction or another,  but cannot  stand        still.&quot;   and the   ekalanzeiger;       .  &quot;The  lack  of clearness  concerning the aims to which  we        are steering is gradually paralysing - indeed killing -        the will  to victory of the August days of 1914.&quot;   What was wanted  was to foiroo  the Chancellor to come out of his   reserve  and give up the  policy of trimming  which he has persis-   tently pursued since the war  began.   This  is  what the country   looked to - the  Reiohstag  to bring about.3.             The General Committee of the Reichstag and  the  Con-  stitutienal  Committee met last Wednesday.    The Constitutional  Committee adjourned till  this  week,  oftor determining to proceed  with a measure  of redistribution, I.e. with  the division of the  overgrown constituencies, during the present session of the  Roichstag;  before doing  so, there had been  a meeting between  tho Chancellor  and the leaders of Parties, and  the Chancellor  explained that  the Government  was prepared at once to deal  with  the matter.                               .              (It must be explained that according to the Constitu-  tion, there  should be one Member of  the Reichstag for every  100,000 inhabitants;  the electoral  divisions,  however, have  never been changed since  the Constitution of the Empire, and
 they now present inequalities of an extreme character, for in- stance, Hamburg, with a population of 932,000 has only 3 members; Berlin, with a populatidn of more than two millions, has only 6. The.-question- of redistribution is therefore an urgent one, which is bein;: repeatedly pressed upon the: Government.)  ,            This utate:aSntl; which appears to be correct, Shows; :; then that up to this ?oint the Government, in deference to the strong agitation outside, is willing at once to go some length in the way of reform;  a promise to this effect has in fact been made some Weeks ago.         :;  The meetings of the General Committee led to very important debates which have produced a erisis similar in character to some which have already taken jlace since the war, but apparently more acute.   At the time of writing-, our information is necessarily incomplete, but the German papers have been talking freely of the impending resignation of the Chancellor;  they have of course often done so before.            It must be remembered that the meetings of the Committee are secret;  we have therefore to depend upon the necessarily inaccurateand generally very impartial /accounts, which appear in the press.   Full accounts of these have been telegraphed and appear in &quot;The Times&quot; and other papers.   No information is available except that which has appeared in the-English press.           : -It appears that the crisis arose from the action of Herr Krzberger, a well-known Catholic leader; .ia a speech made on Friday, he demanded &quot;far-reaching reforms both in domestic and foreign policy, and peace without annexation or indemnities.&quot;   we are told that he took this action without V previous consultation with his Party;  the Social Democrats immediately supported him, but he Was repudiated by Dr. Spahn,
tho official Leader of the Centre Party.   He was answered the.next day, &quot;both by Dr. Spahn and also by Admiral von Capelle and  .Herr Helfferich, the Secretaries of State for the Admiralty andthe interior, and the Chancellor spoke for half an hour;   herefused to commit himself to &quot;Peace without annexations or indom-nities&quot;;  it is said also th^t he refused the demands of theSocial Democrats, which included the immediate nomination ofLeaders of all parties as Ministers and Secretaries of State,i*eV a &quot;Coalition Government&quot;.   Herr ferzberger then repoatedhis attack;  his speechappears to have made a great impression;the Berliner Tageblatt says that Herr Brzberger &quot;spoko with extra-ordinary courage, compelling clearness, and great acerbity, andnot only thoroughly discussed the domestic situation, the sub-marine war and peace possibilities, but dealt with the wholesituation and the attitude of the authorities to this situation,with penetrating force.&quot;   Apparently what made most impressionwas the vigour with which he maintained the ppinion that theeffectiveness of the submarine warfare had been axaggorated.As to this, it is stated that the Committee have expressed awsih to hear Hindenburg and Ludendorff on the military situation.            The impression that the position is a really seriousone was increased by the fact that the Emperor, who had been inAustria, together with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, had returnedto Berlin (he does not appear to have been there for some months,since he went for a cure to Homburg), and there was a meeting  onMonday of the Crown Council (which is the Prussian Ministry withthe Zing presiding). &apos;            Since then there have been all the oxternal signs  of an acute political crisis, which are the same in every country. At the time of writing it appears that it will be solved more or less as similar crises have been in the past.   The Chancellor will ^remain,, probably Zimmermann will be sacrificed as a result
 of the diplomatic blunders for which he is technically respon- &quot;sible, and it is said that there will be changed in the Prussian ministry, and that seats are boing offered to representatives of tho parties,  and even to Scheidemann.   This means probably a real intention to go some way with reform of the Prussian; Constitution.          -  That  which is most noticeable is that the discussion since Sunday has turned almost entirely on the internal question and that little  is said in the Press about the point of peace and war aims    This is remarkable as there can be no doubt that it was the attack on the results of the submarine war. and implied in that, on the  whole war policy, that formed a ohiof part of Srzberger&apos;s original speech.   The Consorship has olearly pre- vented further referonce to this and the German wireless are attempting to remove the impression that was made By the first.reports.:      &quot;The Prussian State Ministry met on Sunday.      &quot;On Monday  morning the Main Committee of the Reiohstag, in    the absence of the Imperial Chanoellor, the State Secretary.    and numerous  members of the Federal Council and of tho Reichs-    tag, continued its discussions regarding questions of foreign    and home policy.    The sitting was strictly confidential.  All    the orators who spoke on Monday expressed great gogret that     part of the  press had not respected the confidential nature    of the last sessions and had published very ambiguous and    erroneous reports.   In contradiction to tho press reports,   ,it was stated today that there is no misoonoeption in the .    Reichstag as  to the present situation,  and that no such view    had been expressed during the negotiations.    The activity of    the U-boat was unanimously recognised,  an activity which  has    surpassed all expectations.    Among the parties an orator of    the National  Liberals was the first to  speak.            It is suggested that as the Chanoellor refuses to agree to the Social Demoeratio peace formula,  this having failed in regard to Russia,  an attempt will be made to find a new formul which will unite, the bourgeois parties:       &quot;Efforts are now made on the part of the  bourgeois parties     to find a solution upon which the bourgeois parties  could     unite,  namely,  on the basis &amp;  Germany waging a defensive     war, that her cause is just,  and that  she  is  ready for peace;     but if her enemies do not want peace,  she will hold  on until     a victorious end is reached.    It is generally believed  that     such a solution is possible,  but there  are  still  some  diffi-     cultics made on the part of the  anncxationist  group  and  the
                      -9-             &apos;a       national Liberals, while the fiantre party with few       exceptions supports Herr $rzberger.&apos;1       There remains the question as to the real influences Wh&amp;oh have been working hehind. Appended will be found an appreciation    Srzbe^ger-ys position and the general character of the Centre party.   At the beginning of&quot; the wer he was strong- ly chauvinist;  some weeks ago we were told he h^d become an &quot;apostle of pessimism11 and was work!ng in Catholic cireles,, especially in Switzerland, for an early peace.       It is suggested in some quarters that possibly the while affair was Bput upw and had been arranged so as to strengthen the hands ,pT the chancellor against the Militarists and Conservatives.   In view of the very outspoken nature of the attack, this seems rather far fetched.We must not ex- elude the hypothesis that SSrzberger was acting ^rom a simpler motive, that he genuinely believed that the,policy of the Government was leading the nation to dis&quot;ster ^nd that he took the only method open to him to stop this.   The me feting of the Committee of the Reichstag offered i convenient opportunity, for this is the only place *here he could speik in such a way that he must be listened to, *nd yet could do so without full publicity.  :.        More important is the question whether Austrian in- fluences have been at work.  Srzberger Ins certainly been in- fluencing the Catholic pe?ce movement which is no doubt in close touch with both Austria and Bavaria.   He is said to have had an audience with the Austrian Emperor.  Now, assuming that Austria is always pressing for a speedy offer of pc*ce on moder- ate terms, and that the Germon- Leaders ^t their recent visit, did not give a rcdy response, it is quite possible that the Austrians wou\d use Erzberger to make a strong attuck on the: Prussian military: party.                       V/;;&apos;;r7v:vv:&apos;        V/hatevex the truth may be as to the details, the
episode is of real importance;  it shows the growth of thegeneral uneasiness and the increasing distruct of the Govern-ment and the ruling military circles... It will give a greatimpulse to the demand for constitutional reform, and willalmost certainly he followed at no long distance by a renewedoffer of peace negotiations - probably not later than the middleof August - and these will almost inevitably be on the generalbasis of a return to the status quo.  This of course is subjectto the condition that there is no ossential change in the mili-tary situation.                                             J. W.

   ...... sAppanflJ^fteekly Report on Germany.JJo-.,^0W./Oil.                      10th July, 1917..                  - *mmm** ******** mm t mi NI^RII*J. I mm.....m........*MRNMW -                       Herr Brzberger.            A warning against this Clerical Democrat or Demagogue is not out of A-lace.    Apart from the fact that,  ... since the outbreak of war,  he  has been extremely active as a German propagandist, formerly in home, afterwards mainly in German-Switzerland, where he inspired a number of news- papers,  his past history as a leader of the Democratic wing of the  Clerical Centre shows the part which he is accustomed  &quot;- play                   ^                     --.  . :y-&apos;i  &apos;   -: to fftgey in keeping that party together and keeping it govern- mental  - always for a political consideration of course. In former days, when the big Army end Navy Bills of the Government were brought In - there was invariably an outory among the clerical, as among the other, democrats.   These protests were voiced by Brzberger in the Reichstag and on looal platforms.   : Meanwhile the older and more cautious leaders, like Spahn,  and the bilesian Catholic land-owners, like Count Ballestrem, preserved a discreet silence or recom- mended  a dispassionate consideration of the Governmentls pro-; posals.    As the debates in --Committee- proceeded, jrzeerger and his  followers gradually came round -the Government meanwhile making  some:unimportant concessions in detail - and they brought with them the tacit / perhaps the reluctant,  accxuies- cence o f the Cat ho lie wo rking-c las s es in &apos;.; e s tphal i a and- Rhenish Prussia.            On those occasions Erzberger was generally backed from first to last by the Kfllnische Volkszeitung,  the great popular Catholic organ in Cologne, while the Catholic ^ermania, published in Berlin,  kept in touch with the Conservative seo- tion of the Catholic  Party.   On this occasion the Kfllnische
in the industrial districts is very strongly organised in&quot;Christian Trade Unions&quot;,  and&apos;that these Unions have to competewith the attractions - of the Social Democratic Unions, whichare secularist.   They have done so most successfully in thepast, and are the only effective bulwark against -fche SocialDemocracy.   This is one of the great reasons -for the patronageof the Clericals by the Emperor end the Government.           Erzberger may not be an agent of the Governmentwhen he criticises it and demands &quot;a purely defensive war&quot; asits programme, but he may be-acting in the interests of hisparty in preventing the whole position in the working-classconstituencies from being rushed by the Social Democrats onthat programmeThe Cctholic Party may be trimming, so asto be ready to support either an annexationist or a non-annexationist policy, as things turn out.    Or it may havetaken contagions fright at the alarm which is shown by thecapitalist classes at the very serious intervention ofAmerica, foreboding economic disaster to Germany after thewar.           Erzberger is a man with a brazen front and brazenlungs, with great powers of work and great influence as apopular agitator.   He is, I should think, as unscrupulous asDerhburgi a kin^of Catholic Dernburg in fact.                                   G.S.                                10th July, 1917.
