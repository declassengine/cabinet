xXXConveyance ofHorses fromAustralia toIndia.   2.  The War Cabinet had &quot;before them copies of.correspondence between the War Office and theMinistry of Shipping in regard to tonnage for theconveyance of horses from Australia to India(Paper G.T. 1129).       The Secretary of State for War explainedthat the horses were required, for use in India.Mesopotamia,  and possibly E^ypt in the winter of1918-19.  It Was necessary to make arrangementsfor transport now.  inVorder that the animals mightbe shipped this winter and become acclimatisedbefore the following one-.  Otherwise experience:had shown that the v/astage would be excessive.       Sirleo. rloney pointed out the other essen-tial and immediate demands upon shipping, and statedthat if tonnage were allocated for the conveyanceof these animals from Australia there would be aloss of carrying power equivalent to 400,000 tonsof cargo.  Ten ships allotted to Australia wereequal to thirty ships fetching food from America,       The Quartermaster-General, on the otherhand, said that unless the animals were shippedthe cavalry in India, Mesopotamia, and Egyptcould not be-kept up to strength during 1918-19..He read a letter from the Qtiartermaster-Generaiin India, who reported that the local suppliesof animals in that country had been&quot;sucked dry&quot;.       The Secretary of State for the Coloniessuggested that the Government of Australia shouldbe asked to make an effort to supply the tonnage,and the War Cabinet accordingly directed that -    The Secretary of State for the Colonies should,        in concert with the Secretary of State        for War, send a telegram to the Common-        wealth Government making a strong appeal        to them to provide the tonnage required        for the conveyance of animals to India        out of the supply of ships which they have        in their possession.xxWar^M-st 173.
