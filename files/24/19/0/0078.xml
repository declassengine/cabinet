1,   Eefore I can hope to begin effectively to take holdof even the most pressing of the problems which theCabinet has set this Ministry to solve it is necessary tocreate an office organisation capable of dealing rapidlywith very big and difficult questions each of whichreacts on the others in such a way that progress isimpossible unless work is being done on all.   Within thenext few weeks an organisation will have to be set up forthe control of Meat, Wheat and other cereals, while TeaMilk and various other commodities present equally urgentproblems.   I have also to get Into shape detailedarrangements for equitable distribution.   All of this isadditional to the considerable administration of existingOrders and Regulations.2.   Men of two types are necessary for such an organisationthe ; trained Government or railway official withadministrative experience and the expert business man.   Atpresent there are very few men in the Department with anyconsiderable administrative experience.   The whole fabricof the office must be built up in a very short time if theproblems facing us are to be tackled before it is too late *The training of men is obviously impossible;  the only courseis to borrow men In every  grade from other offices.Unfortunately, all established offices are themselves hardworked, since great numbers of men have gone to the Armyand others have been lent to new Departments.3.   It is essential that I should have an authority from theCabinet to obtain men even to the detriment of work which                                                 may/
may be regarded as of first class importance, and- even at therisk of temporary Inconvenience to other offices which haveproperly trained staffs.   in order to induce otherDepartments to part with men it should be made clear that atthe moment the adequate staffing of the Ministry of Pood musttake precedence.4,   In the memorandum on man-power for the Cabinet it wasestimated that the Civil Service might safely release twothousand mon and on Cabinet instructions the Departments arenow arranging for the release of these men in proportionsfixed by the Treasury.   Prom the two thousand who are thusactually being at the moment made available even theconsiderable number which the Ministry of Food requires, -atpresent perhaps two hundred, - is not a very serious reductionand I should certainly have proposed that the estimate of twothousand men available for release should have been reduced bythat number had I known of the probable needs of this Ministry.I suggest therefore, that for the moment airy man released by aDepartment for service with the Ministry of Food should becounted as a man- released for the army.   In view of the recentdecision that men are not to be taken from agriculture for thearmy since food is the first necessity, it is reasonable toapply, the same principle to men in the Government servicewithout whose work in this Ministry all the efforts in regardto food production may prove of no effect.
