SECRET- .                   &apos;  WAR  CABINET.C-.T. 1353           ALLIES1  DIPLOMATIC COHKITLiEHTS IN REGARD TO-                 TURKEY, BULGARIA AND AUSTRIA.         (Memorial  signed by certain Members of Parliament)To          -                      &apos;                           -   THE PRIME MINISTER.     Although tho facts are .net yet made public in this country.,we gather from the Italian and French Press that the British                                                              in                       a.city inhabited by     ------        --------- .. .   -------   -       --------Government -has recently entered into new obligations with Italywith regard.to the -annexation by Italy of certain territories .iAsia Minor., of Smyrna, a city inhabited by Greeks and Turks,     V;e hold that not only is such an undertaking contrary tothe declared war aims of this country, of Russia, and of theUnited States, but that it is disastrous from a political andmilitary point&apos; of&apos;.view. -&apos;-.:&apos;).--y.      -                  \  % ...  The publication of this undertaking in the foreign press.can but. serve to bind Turkey all the closer .to the Germanic powers.It encourages and gives foundation for those suspicions, already -wide-spread in Russia,,that some of the Entente Allies are notfighting solely for their defence and for the liberation.of nmallnations, but still desire acquisitions of territory inhabited bypopulations of different race, who have as much right to selfdetermination in the matter of. government as the Italians, theFrench or ourselves.            ,     From the military point of view, though we naturally hesitateto give our opinion., we hold that any further dispersion^of effortwhich diverts troops from the German fronts to engage in increasingour commitments in the Balkans or the Mear East is bad strategy.     From the diplomatic point, of view we welcomed,  and recall toyour attention in the above connection, the statements made byyourself  !and other Government spokesmen in the secret session,  -viz., that we have no essential quarrel with Austria and Bulgariacomparable to our quarrel with Germany, and that nothing should bedone to tie our hands in regard to any possible detachment of one,two or possibly all three of Germany1s Allies.   If ,we are toconcentrate,upon the defeat of our major enemy we are of opinionthat the Russian revolution and the  entry of the United Statesgives us an opportunity for the reconsideration by all the Alliesof our diplomatic commitments in regard to Turkey, Bulgaria andAustria.                     -   .\&apos;   &apos;  We do&quot;not &quot;wish to thwart the legitimate demands of ourItalian and French Allies asfar as theyare consistent with ourdeclared war aims, and we believe that the people of those countrie.are.the last who would desire to prolong the war for the sake cfColonial expansion in the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor or Syria.We.hold that the handing ever of Smyrna to the Italians is a deathblow :to:the possibility.of peace with Turkey and prejudices ourchances of securing the liberation of ,the Armenian and Arab races.We believe that.the freedom of these peoples is essential per se,and vital to us,  from the point of view.of the security cf our&quot;.
  Eastern communications.-.   We urge you, therefore,  to  enlist  the  support  of  the  Russian and American -Governments in the -  necessary:revision  of any such-agreements in order  to  bring/ them more &quot;into:/consonance- with our war aims as recently.set  out  to the Russian  Government to the end that we may con- /centrate upon tho defeat of our chief enemy,.Germany,  by.  every means  at  our/disposal,  diplomatic as,well as  military.   &apos;        ..; :     mutual -. &quot;;V       :   -                        ,J:\ V.&apos;--             1-; (Signed) -&apos;.v;&apos;&apos;: \ HENRY BENTINCK.;/            ^ ^ &apos;  &apos;                              OERVASE BECKETT.&apos;  ; :.&apos; -  &apos;  &apos;; /      ;  V:-::.,,:/::/.  j   J .&apos;W. - WILSON. . &apos;    ; &apos;.    &apos;   &quot;  &quot;      - . -.. - &apos;;.          ;v     - \\;-;.MATHEW WILSON.&apos;  .      *.-/-&quot;;   ;: &apos;  ;             -              &apos; .
