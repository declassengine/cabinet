Q.T. 1318                     Release of Coal Miners for the Army-                     (Memorandum by the Coal Controller)       Hots by the Controller of Coal Mines on Lord&apos;Derby&apos;s &apos;  Memorandum of 7th June, 1917, end the Adjutant General&apos;s Memo-  randum of 31st May, 1917, on the Position and Prospect of  Recruiting  (G.T. 965).     The following comments are necessary upon the AdjutantGeneral*s Memorandumi&apos;ti     (1)   Paragraph 9.   20,000 coal miners were to be made           available for general sorvioe by the end of January.     (2)   Paragraph 10i  On the 29ih March a further EG,QUO           ooal miners were ordered to be made available.     Tne methdda adopted to secure this number of men havobeon (1) the recruitment of surfaoe-worlcers (Form 17)(2) the recruitment of men who have entered the coal-miningindustry ainoe 15th august, 1915. (2ora 16)f and (0) therooruitment of men who have entered the industry since 4thAugust, 1914. (form 20).   :..  The recult of those three methods (including the Voluntaryenlist ae-nts mentionod later) was stated by the Director ofRecruiting on tho 26th June, 1917, to be as follows          Posted between 26th January. 1917    :           ;  and 30th May, 1917                   10,695          Posted ainoe 31st May, 1917 and             ready for poo-ting subject to             possibility of reduction by             olaims on personal grounds            5,86516,560shewing an estimatod deficit   from tho 40,000 awarded of           23,440     The &quot;functions of the Home Office in the matter of therelease of miners (eatcopt as ta the supervision of theColliery Recruiting Courts) were transferred to my Departmenton the 24th iiaroh, 1917.     Form 17 (Surface^workers) and Form 18 (post - 15thAugust 1915 moo) wore issued to tho collieries (to be filled,up and returned to the Colliery Recruiting&apos;Courts), on the2End January,  1917.   Difficulty aroso,  however, in South Walesbecause in -iiooord&amp;neo with the&apos;lew attested men were receiving14 dayo calling-up notice and oortain non-attosted men werereceiving 2 months1 notice.  Accordingly on the 8th inarch, 1917,upon the suggestion of the Director of ,georiiiti;ng.,.ttio prooedureon Forma l1!1 and 18 was abandoned and a two months! period of
19,2voluntary enlistment &quot;began,  which ended on the 8th May.  Itsoon became apparent that the voluntary scheme would notproduce the necessary number, and- accordingly after corres-pondence with the Miners * Federation and subsequent to aninterview with Mr. Arthur Henderson, it was decided to pro-ceed to recruit all men who  had entered the industry sincethe 4th august, 1914, with the exception of certain barred,classes.  On the 19th May.Form 20 was issued to thecollieries for the names to  bo inserted of men enteringthe industry between the 4th August,, 1914; and the 15thAugust, 1916, thus covering  with Form 18 the.whole period ofthe war*             &apos;  &apos;?PK?H3&amp;,, nliTHQDS[,J)gi i aadRUITi^li     &quot;$hen tho subject of recruitment of miners was in thehands of the Home Office Sir George Cavo promised theMiners1 Federation that, they would.be consulted upon.the;various steps in tho recruitment  of miners, and it is essentialthat the Government should carry that body with, them in the.matter if industrial unrost  is to be avoided.  Since the 7thMarch, the Miners&apos; Fed-ration, through their representativeson my Advisory Boards haVo had before them tho possiblenecessity of recruiting unmarried miners from 18 to 25 yearsof ago in the event of the other  methods not yielding thenumber ordered b;  the War Cabinet.  By discussion at myAdvisory Boer^d, by personal  interview, and by lettorj theadoption of this method has  been pressed upon them, but thereis a section In the Federation who  re not over anxious toexpedite recruiting,, and have secured postponements of decisiveadvice until the results of  the voluntary scheme, suggested bythe Director of itocruiting,  and again of the post-4th august,1914, scheme, were seen.  It is only fair to state that theopinion on the Miners1 side  of my Advisory Board has through-out been divided as to whether the combing out of the men whohave ontered tho Mining industry since august 1914 will producethe balanoo required to reach the total of 40,000;  those mosteager to assist thought it would, whilo the others have heldthe opposite view, and my own vie?/ has been In accord with tholatter.  It is now quite evident  that the post-4th August,. 1914,comb-out Is not going to yield the balanoe required.     On the  3rd June, however, a letter was received from theMinors&apos; Federation recommending a method for the rocruitmentof unmarried miners between  18 and 25 with certain modifications, which are now being discussed with tho Director of itooruitingand worked out in detail with the Miners1 Federation and theMining Associations of Great Britain.  The method contemplatedis that of forming local committees of coal^-owners and miners,who will seleot their quotas from the. eligible men by means ofthe ballot.     The greatest tact is neoessary. in dealing T^ith a body liketho Miners&apos; Federation,  and  any attempt to force the pace undulywill merely play into the hands of the section less keen onrecruiting.
