j^ftferREPORT OH SERBIA i&apos;.ND KOHTEHLGRQ.  IV.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Jjifomiatxon.DSW/O04party Politics in Montenegro.      Information to hand makes it possible to. expand and in some details correct the statement of the political situation in Montenegro made in Report No.. 5.  The old Government, which was there described as the Tomanovii- Government, ought more properly to have been called by the name of the Prime Minister and Minister of War, Brigadier-General Matanovic, as Mr Tomanovic (Orderly to the King and son of the well-known-ex-Prime Minister) merely held the portfolio of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet.  The next most important member of the late Government was Mr IIic, a Serbian barrister from Croatia who had only been a Montenegrin subject for a short time.      That such a Government, consisting of men who had played no important part in Montenegrin politics but were closely associated with the Court, after being called to office last January in order, as the Kingrs trusted creatures, to replace the strongly. Nationalist and Jugoslavist Government of Dr Radovi6, should have found it impossible to remain in office throws interesting light on the strength of the Jugoslav movement among Montenegrins&apos;.      The conjecture made in Report No. &apos;3 that the resignation of the Government was to some extent connected with the Italian proclamation of &quot;Albanian Independence&quot; is borne out by a leading article in Ujedinjenje  (June 2/15), which has already been referred\ to as the organ of the  ex-Premier Radovi6 and the party working for Jugoslav unity  smong the Montenegrins.  The leading article makes it perfectly clear that the causes of the Governments resignation were twe, closely connected:  (1) King Nicolas1 telegram of May 11/24 to King Victor Emmanuel, and  (2) the Italian proclamation
                                                         filllof &quot;Albanian Independence&apos;&apos;.     (1)  The telegram of King Nicolas  ran as  follows               &quot;I am happy to acknowledge what  glorious  victories          your Army has  won and my enthusiasm and admiration  goes          out to It.   Greeting with my whole  heart its Commander-in-          Chief, Ihope  that the same  hand which freed Italian lands          will quickly be stretched out to my unhappy mountaineers1&apos;.     This reference to the &quot;Italian lands&quot;&apos; freed by King VictorEmmanuels armies was too much even for the Hatanovi6 Government,for it clashed with the  sympathies entertained  &quot;by nearly all  Jugo-slavs for the Slovene populations of the occupied territories.Special indignation was  expressed at King Nicolas1  hepe  that  the&quot;hand which freed Italian lands will quickly  he stretched out tomy unhappy mountaineers&quot;.  It declares that this remark  infliotsa fatal injury on Serbian and Slovene  aspirations,  and goes on toattack King Nicolas as caring only for the interests  of  his :dynasty and not for the  cause which every true  Montenegrin has atheart - Jugoslav union.     (2)  The Montenegrins, says Ujedinjenje,  found the telegramespecially outrageous when ten days later it.  was followed by  theItalian proclamation of  the Albanian protectorate.  It is.themore intolerable that the Albanians should &quot;be considered a nation&quot;capable  of independent  life and racial union&quot;  when the  same  rightis denied the Jugoslavs.  There was no course open even  to theUatanovii Government, but, by its resignation,  to dissociate  itselffinally from the attitude of King Nicolas.The New Government.     The new Prime Minister, Mr Popovi6, turns  eught  to  be none cfthe four men of that name mentioned in my last  Report, but an evenless representative person.   He is Djeno (Eugene)  Popovii, formerly
                      i                                                                 iConsul-General for Montenegro in Rome and now 72 years of age.He is a native of Bocche di Cattaro.  HO fought as a Garibaldianin Italy, passed most of his life there j and. was for a time, ifhe is not still, an Italian subject.  The new Government is,therefore, even more unrepresentative of the nation than was atfirst conjectured.   Recent events seem to show beyond anyquestion that practically the whole of intelligent and independentfeeling in Montenegro is solid for Jugoslav union, and that theKing will be unable to secure any real support among his subjectsin defence of the particularist interests which his dynastyrepresents.                                                   6.7.17.
