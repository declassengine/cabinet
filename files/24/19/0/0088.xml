On July 1st at 10 a,ro. after an artillerypreparation of 1 to 2 days, the 6th Corps on the left of11th Army and the 41st, 7th,Siberian, 34th and 22nd Corpson the right of 7th Army attacked on front Avgustovka towest of Trosyanets, North East of Brzezany.   The 14 Divisionsactively engaged occupied the enemy&apos;s defensive zone whichhad been thoroughly prepared by the artillery.   They showedhowever no general wish to press further and by 6 p.m. withexception of the 6th Corps and 7th Siberian Corps all hadonce more retired to their own trenches.   Enemy counter-attacks are given as the reason but in several places theRussian Infantry retired without being counter-attacked andwithout being pressed by heavy fire.   They had beenimpressed by the unwonted artillery preparation and went asfar as they could without running great rislfs.        .-: A mile was/gained by 6 th Corps on a front of about2 miles.   7th Siberian Corps advanced on front of 1 mileatout 2 miles towards Brzeaany.   On JUly 2nd the 35thDivision of the 17th Corps and the 49th Corps consisting of4th Einnish Division,.the Czech brigade and 6th FinnishDivision together with 6th Corps on the general frontPresovtse to Kuropatniki.  (l?.E. of Brzezany) a considerablesuccess Was obtained by the 49th Corps which made good itsadva.nce in places up to 2f miles chiefly owing to the finespirit of the :Czech. Brigade, the 9 weak battalions of whichtook 3,300 prisoners and 20 out of the 26 guns captured in theday.                        ^               &apos;&apos;-/yMeanwhile  :.
      &quot;Meanwhile the 7th Army remained passive  and 34th Corpswas relieved by 2nd Guards, the Army Commander1s  only importantreserve,  The 1st Guard Corps,  which was forming  the reservein the 11th Army was unable to  develop the success of 49thCorps on the 2nd, as it was too far back.-  The morale of the2nd Guard Division is specially bad.  On the 3rd  July.  1stGuards Corps was induced to move for ward to the  front.It was hoped to continue the advance on the 4th but only2 battalions of the Corps had been persuaded to move into thefront line by the evening of that day.   By the evening of the3rd. 7th Siberian Corps in the  7th Army retired to itsoriginal trenches, not under pressure but from a  confession ofboredom and an idea that it had done its duty*   Except amongofficers: losses had been light.  The;casualties in the 15divisions engaged on July 1st are officially stated at 17,339of all ranks including 2,100 missing.   ;As a matter of factit is suspected that a proportion of the  ,435 men reportedkilie d ar e hi ding in the woo ds:and the wounds o f  a lar goproportion of the wounded have  certainly been self-inflicted.About 15 officers of the prisoners taken and 1,200 men areGermans, of the poorest quality and 3 officers and 191 menare Turks;;  the remainder are Austrian*   The 81st AustrianResident surrendered in a body  and marched the next day throughTarnopol to the rear with Its band playing and escorted by afew C os sacks * ;  Extraordinary passiveness was exhib it ed by theGermans, who probably did not fire one shot to the Russiansfifty.  The direction of the Russian Artillery leaves much tobe desired;  its preparation was not in sufficient depth andshell ?/as wasted, there Y/as no  proper liaison with the infantry.         Commanders of all grades were continually thwarted bythe cowardice of the infantry and the impossibility of enforcingobedience to orders.  The men of the cavalry and  artillery aresound.  In several instances the cavalry Is being used to
      disarm men  in re at who refuse to fight hut, so far as I know&quot;&apos;(     npne  of  the men have heen punished.  Kerenski is doing his      utmost to inspire enthusiasm hut he sets down every failure      as  due to the command.  Belkovich, has heen replaced in      the command of 7th Army by Selviachev from the 49th Army Corps      and the  latter has been succeeded by Maimaievski who marched      to  the attack on the 1st at the head of his 4th Division.      The 12th Army Corps on the right of 8th Army and the 5th      Siberian Corps nan the right of 11th Army, were to commence      subsidiary  operations on 6th July.  Staff of front have      now the  2 divisions, of 5th Corps and the Polish division in      reserve  and from the 13th the 3 divisions of the 45th Corps      will  be  available.  They profess to believe that these will      be  enough to. enable them to continue the main operations till      about the 18th by which they hope to have caused the with-      drawal of 7 more German divisions from western theatre in      addition to the 3 already reported.  On the western front   v.  the men  have so far declined to attack.              My  view is that when the present operations are over      no  more  active co-operation can be hoped for from the Russian   : ;  Army  unless the Government here has the courage to stop      agitation and to restore the death penalty in martial law.              Officers at the front think the men will remain in      the trenches during winter strictly on the defensive but I      believe  the difficulty of feeding them and the large towns      through  1 4th winter will be insurmountable.
