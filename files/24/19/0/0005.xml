RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.                                                                Memorandum of the Reconstruction Committee on the Final Report of the Departmental Committee on Juvenile Education in relation to Employment after the War.                                     The Report of the Committee on Juvenile Education is excellent in its analysis of the problems to be met and in its statement of the general principles which should inspire reform. Its description of the present evils of juvenile and adolescent employment confirms the conclusion reached by all previous inquirers, and it is right in defining the problem as that of replacing "the conception of the juvenile as primarily a little wage-earner" by "the conception of the  juvenile as primarily the workman and citizen in industry." It is, therefore, as the Report points out, necessary to bring the age of adolescence "out of the purview of economic exploitation and into that of the social conscience." With the ideals set forth in the Report we are in whole-hearted agreement.  In particular we approve of the raising of the school-leaving age, the abolition of the existing half-time system, the establishment of compulsory continuation schools in the day time up to the age of eighteen, the adoption of fixed terms during the year for entering and leaving school, the importance of "the provision of better teachers and of smaller classes," the repeal of the twopenny limit on the rate which the county council may raise without special sanction from the Local Government Board for the purposes of higher education, the extension of the School Medical Service to continuation schools, the establishment of classes for unemployed juveniles, and the provision of skilled guidance in the choice of employment. In many respects, however, we believe that much stronger action is required than the Report suggests. It may be admitted that it would be impracticable to put into operation immediately on the return of peace a scheme which was adequate to meet the needs so admirably outlined in the Report. We would suggest, however, that it would have been possible for the Committee to have put forward a comprehensive programme which could gradually be put into operation during, say, the next ten years. Such a programme, we believe, should include the raising of the full-time school-leaving age to sixteen, and the establishment of compulsory half-time secondary schools up to the age of eighteen.  At the end of the War an instalment of the policy could be put into practice;  at  the end of five years a further instalment would be required, and at the end of ten years, during which period there would be ample time for the necessary preparations and for the adjustment of industrial organisation, the complete policy would be put in operation. It is felt that, unless the foundations are laid of a comprehensive scheme of adolescent education, a great opportunity will be missed, and the necessity for further reforms will occasion long-continued controversy in the future.                          We would draw attention specially to the following points:                                       A.- The School-Leaving Age.                                                                      1. In paragraph 11 the Committee express the view that they are "unable to find" adequate confirmation for the belief that public opinion is as yet ripe for a universal "prolongation of full-time education beyond the age of fourteen."  This does not appear to us to recognise the fact which higher wages and maintenance allowances to necessitous parents would play in winning over public opinion to the raising of the full-time school-leaving age. It is interesting to observe the increase in the number of pupils attending public secondary schools which has taken place during the War, largely, we believe, as a result of improved economic circumstances.      2. It may be admitted that there are  difficulties in the way of local option, as suggested in paragraph 12 of the Report. It may be pointed out, however, that already in contiguous areas there are different regulations regarding the school-leaving age, half time, and the employment of school children we believe in the social value                                               U (33)1339-55  125 5/17 E&amp;B                                             
of local  patriotism, and we consider that it should be given ample opportunities foi&quot;expression.   The suggestion that local authorities would not use&apos; their powers is notborne out by the experience of the past, for. many local authorities have established  aschool-leaving age higher than the minimum imposed by statute, and in other functionshave  gone far beyond  the  minimum requirements of the Board of Education. . Buteven if it were true that local  authorities were unwilling  to use  their full powers toraise the age, say, to sixteen, we still believe it would be  desirable to establish in an.Act of Parliament the ideal of sixteen as the. universal full-time-school-leaving age.    3. The  proposal to establish a uniform school-leaving age at  fourteen merelyconsists in bringing the practice of a number of  education authorities up to the levelof the best.  Roughly speaking, only one-sixth of the child population resides in areaswhere local  byelaws  allow exemption at the age of thirteen, close upon, one-half inareas where,  the school-leaving age is  already fourteen.  : The proposal of  the  Com-mittee, therefore, amounts to raising the school-leaving age of  one-sixth of the childpopulation by one year, and the school-leaving  age. of less than one-half  by somemonths.   This  cannot  be  considered  to  be a  reform  in keeping with the  spiritanimating paragraphs 2 and 9 of the Report.             -  B. HOURS or ATTENDANCE  AT CONTINUATION SCHOOLS.    1. In paragraph 10 it is stated &quot; it appears to us essential that any new legislation  should  override the Factory Acts, in so  far as they are inconsistent with its pro-  visions.&quot;   Further, it is stated in paragraph  24 that the Committee &quot; hardly feel  that it is within our province to propose  any further limitation of employment than&quot; is necessary  in order to secure  our principal  object, which is the provision of&apos;&quot; facilities for  education under conditions which will leave the child in a physical andu mental state to profit  by that education.&quot;   The suggestions made by the Committee-are that in employment regulated by law &quot; the permitted hours  of labour should no&quot; doubt  be reduced by the number of  those claimed. for the  continuation  classes,&quot;and that there should be &quot;a substantial reduction in the hours of van-boys and ware-house-boys.&quot;    We feel  that the-question of  hours of labour and  ability to benefit byeducation are so closely bound together that it  is  impossible to separate them, andthat definite  recommendations should have been made on  the limitation  of the hoursof labour.  We regret  that the Committee:, in  paragraph 34,  should  refer to  thecontinued existence of a working week&quot; of anything from forty-eight to ninety hours.&quot;In our view,  there is needed a  drastic limitation of the hours of labour of all employedyoung persons, if the  new educational facilities are to be fully utilised.    2. The proposal to  establish continuation schools for  &quot; not less than eight hours a&quot;week &quot; is in. our opinion vague, and  the amount  of instruction suggested is  certainlytoo small to meet the  real needs of  the situation.  The Committee believe that eightlours a  week  will be  sufficient  to  attain the end in  view.  We would  point out,however,  that  even a half-time  system of  schooling between the ages of twelve andfourteen  has admittedly proved altogether inadequate  in  the past to  counteractinjurious industrial influences.  It  is highly questionable, therefore, whether  eightlours  a  week  taken  out of a working week of  &quot; anything from forty-eight to ninetyhours &quot; is likely to fulfil its object in any appreciable degree.  In any case we believethat there would be considerable administrative difficulties in the way of  enforcing:regulations compelling  attendance for eight hours a week, which would be  overcomeby something approaching a half-time system.    The suggestion that these classes should be  held within fixed hours extending to7 p.m. may result  in continuation schools being normally placed at  the end of a fullday&apos;s  work.&apos;  It would  seem  desirable to  ensure  that this  should  not be  the case,neither by a drastic limitation of the hours of labour or by narrower limits of  hours for-continuation  classes.                    C. CURRICULUM OF CONTINUATION CLASSES.    1. The suggestions of the Committee  regarding the  curriculum  of  continuationschools lack clearness.  We are told  that the object of establishing these classes is not&quot;merely an  industrial  one,&quot; and again that civics and the humanities &quot;must by nomeans be excluded,&quot; and further, that the instruction provided &quot; must not be narrowly.technical.&quot; .  It would be preferable to have put forward clearly the positive statement.that continuation, classes were  to. be  governed by educational requirements, and  that,.therefore, their outlook would be humane and not professional.
     It is suggested, that young  people between  sixteen and eighteen should  take up Major  and Minor Courses  which  &quot; require some six hours a  week  for technical subjects.&quot;   This allows two hours per week  for  physical  training,  for  English, geography, and other suggested subjects, as &quot; music, art, local history, home in- dustries, first aid, natural history.&quot;   Whilst it is said that civics and the humanities &quot;must by no means  be excluded,&quot;  the preponderance of technical subjects in the Major and Minor Courses leaves little room for non-professional subjects.&apos;     It does not seem to us that the Committee have sufficiently  considered the existing organisation  of  industry and those changes which have taken  place during the War and which are likely to be permanent.   In our view, it is probable  that the scope of technical education, as  the term  is  usually understood, is much narrower than is generally assumed.  It  appears - to be  taken for granted too often  that the majority of the workers in industry are engaged in  occupations in which technical education  is  desirable and possible. Modern industrial developments, however, are making this less and less true, and it would be a great mistake to stereotype a system of education for young people in which technical  education played a large  part, at a time when the industrial system was undergoing  great changes.             -     2. We incline  to the view  that in  addition to  formal gymnastic exercises, organised  games  should  form part of. the system  of  continuation, schools.,. This, however, is impossible apart from an increase in  the number of hours of attendance..&apos;     3. The curriculum for girls suggests that they  are regarded almost entirely as future general servants or household drudges.   The curriculum is not  only narrow, but far from  educational.  The humanities  appear to be covered by one-and^a-half hours&apos; English and an hour for singing.  The greater part of  the time is to be given to household  work  or sewing or arithmetic, from, the point of view of household accounts.;  This tendency is even more marked  in the notes  on the curriculum, for rural areas.   Here, such matters as  learning to mend the hem of a skirt or a frayed elbow are actually included&apos; in the compulsory education of girls  from sixteen to&quot;eighteen.  The teaching of rural science is included in the curriculum for boys but not even touched in that for girls.  Whilst.it is clear that handiwork, should be included, it should be confined to work which has a definite educational value, and should not overshadow those subjects which widen the mental outlook and increase, the enjoy- ment of life.  It is surely as important to appeal  to the  highest&apos; and best interests of girls as well as of boys..        -           . .    4.: The suggestion that continuation , schools should be open in the:.evening for: voluntary attendance may open the  way to some  sort of pressure which would make them compulsory in essence,  and endeavour to secure all the advantages of a half-time system of schooling whilst continuing existing.conditions and hours of juvenile labour. We feel that this proposal will be  viewed in many quarters with deep suspicion.  We are, however,  heartily in sympathy  with the general policy of keeping  the evening schools open for social and recreative purposes.                        tX-CO-OPERATION WITH  EMPLOYERS.&apos;     It appears to be suggested in the Report that  the necessary arrangements for continuation classes are. to be made with employers, and in Appendix 0. the suggestion is made that &quot;there should be close, co-operation  between the Education Authority on the one hand and the employer on the other &quot; in such matters as schemes of education for part-time day classes, &amp;c.  It seems to us  not  merely advisable, but essential that on these  questions there should, also be close co-operation with the Trade Unions concerned..     It is clear, however,  that the enforcement  of the law. relating to attendance at continuation  classes  must rest  mainly upon  the  employer.    We  do  not  regard paragraph 27, dealing with, penalties, as sufficiently definite, and &quot;would urge  that the employer should-     (a) Send  a list of all  young persons in his  employment to  the Local Education           Authority.    &quot;  .     (o) Not be allowed to employ any young person who does not present a certificate         - regularly, stating that he is making the required attendances.     (c)  Be subject to a penalty for neglecting to  satisfy himself that a young person      : -    has such a certificate, or  for failing to make the arrangement necessary for           attendance at school.:  -  .&apos;,-     .....  .     .  &apos;             U  1339-55    V                        .                         A 2
                     E.- -CLASSES FOR  UNEMPLOYED JUVENILES.     The Committee do not appear to make enough of the proposal to establish special classes for unemployed juveniles.  There has been, in the past a  good deal of inter- mittent unemployment of youths  between the ages of fourteen and  eighteen which might  well be filled by physical training, and  general oversight in special classes. It may be that classes for unemployed juveniles would.be of  great value daring the period  immediately following the War.   One of the questions to which the attention, of the  Committee was  specially drawn  in  its terms of reference was that  of young people  who, after  the  War, &quot; cannot immediately find advantageous. employment..&quot; On this point we feel that fuller provision should have been suggested.              F.-JUVENILES  ABNORMALLY  EMPLOYED DURING THE  WAR.     Another special question in the  terms of reference of  the Committee was that of children and young persons &quot; who have  been abnormally employed during  the War.&quot; We confess to a feeling of deep disappointment as  to the Committee&apos;s treatment of this problem.   A large number of children will  be  over fourteen when  legislation is passed, but who were exempt  from school attendance in 1914 or 1915 at the age of twelve.  Under the Committee&apos;s proposals, nothing will be  done for such children at all.  The intelligence of the &quot;leavers &quot; during the years 1914-17 will be lower  thanthat of  any for the last twenty years. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that we aregoing far to produce a generation of  illiterates.   Apart from general reasons for moreextensive reforms,  therefore,  the  special circumstances of the War have producedspecial  reasons for it.  We have to repair the educational wastage of the War period.It is difficult to overestimate the gravity of the situation.   Several hundred thousandchildren, perhaps over  a million, have had their education reduced  by one or twoyears... Many of them  are  likely to be displaced  from their present work after theWar, to drift into unemployment or casual employment.  If they are over fourteen (asa large  number  will be) when legislation is j)assed,  they will be exempt from com-pulsory &quot;attendance at continuation  schools.  The situation might be met to someextent by enacting that attendance at continuation schools is obligator)- on all childrenunder fifteen, at the date when the Act is passed, as well as on children reaching theage of fourteen after that day.   That would bring in at  once something  approachinghalf a  million children, a considerable proportion, though not nearly.all those whohave  been&quot;&apos;prematurely exempted from  school attendance.. We would suggest evenmore  drastic action, even if it involved maintenance grants, with which the Committeeare. not  in sympathy, rather than that young people who have rendered the communityservice  during the War should be placed at a disadvantage in later years by the lossof the advantages which others have  enjoyed.            Gr.-QUESTIONS  AFFECTING OTHER GOVERNMENT  DEPARTMENTS.    We are specially asked to make our observations upon those sections of the Reportwhich refer to the transfer  of powers from other  Departments to the  Board ofEducation.                                          ;-  -    1.  We  are unanimously agreed upon  the advisability of  transferring from thecertifying factory surgeons to the school medical officers the work  of certifying, as tophysical fitness, the children for  employment under the Factory Acts, and wouldsuggest further that certification should be extended to juveniles employed  otherwisethan under the Factory Acts.  The suggestion made above would do much to emphasisethe importance of educational interests during the period  of  adolescence, and wouldbring under medical supervision  the large number  of boys  and girls who  are notemployed in work places under the Factory Acts.    2.  The  Committee suggest that  powers under the Employment of Children Actshould be transferred to Local  Educational Authorities and  the Board of Education.The Committee take the view that regulations under this Act, apart from the specialquestion of  street trading, are &quot;probably adequate.&quot;   From  this view  we dissent.With the abolition of half-time it seems to us that there is  no  case whatever left forthe continuance  of  the employment of school  children out  of school hours.  Webelieve it to  be an impossibility to enforce adequate regulations  governing the employ-ment of children in  a number of miscellaneous employments.  We  deeply regret thatthe Committee should not have recommended the total abolition of ail  forms of wage-earning employment of children who are full-time scholars.  We cannot believe it is
possible &quot; to perfect a civilisation for -which our men have shed  their blood and our women their tears&quot; so long  as we  tolerate  the  employment of young  children for-gam.       J          &apos;              ;                                H-CONCLUSION.     We believe  that education is the foundation of true national greatness, and in consequence that educational reconstruction must be placed in the forefront of the. schemes which are to be adopted at the  end of the War.   Whilst we  regard the proposals, made  by the Committee  as a  distinct  advance towards  an educational system worthy of our best  traditions and of the sacrifices which have been made during the War,  we believe that it falls far short of what is necessary to realise the potential qualities of the people of this country.   The Prime Minister in his charge- to us expressed the hope that the Reconstruction Committee would in its proposals be above all fearless.  We would recommend,  therefore, that  bolder steps  than those suggested should be taken, with the knowledge that an appeal to the people on^grounds of national welfare  and national honour would meet with a worthy response.
