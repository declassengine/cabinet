    . The losses during the current week have &quot;been distributed. as  follows : South and West of Ireland, 5; Mediterranean, 3;  Channel, Bay of Biscay,  North  and West of Scotland, 2 each.  Sixteen large boats appear to have been operating at the beginning of the week and  eighteen at the end.  Considering these numbers, there has been comparatively little activity, except that five  boats  appeared on approach route &quot; B &apos;r (South-West of Ireland) on the  8th July, and seem to Jaaye correctly determined  the line of approach in use at the time.     The submarine that was reported bombarding Ponta JDelgada in the Azores on the 4th July appears to have been away from her base for at least five weeks, and was  last reported attacking a ship 200 miles east of the Azores onthe 6th July.     Sixteen encounters have been reported  with enemy.submarines during the week,- and in one case a submarine is known and in another believed to have been destroyed.     The convoy of eighteen ships which left Hampton  Roads  on  the  25th June  has arrived  safely in port  One of the.convoy was torpedoed near  the Lizard, but  was . towed into Falmouth by the escorting, tug.  Half the convoy  proceeded to  the  west and half to the east coast, one of the destroyers  escorting the latter portion being torpedoed in the vicinity of the  Owers&apos; Lightship,- but she was also towed into harbour. The next convoy of twenty ships is due on the 13th July from Hampton Roads. .   V There has been  considerable minelaying  activity, on &quot;the North-East  Coast of England and East Coast of Scotland.   Sixty-six mines were destroyed during the week.  .  . The figures given in Naval Appreciation ,Na&apos; 6 showed that eighty-five British ships of over 1,600 tons were sunk during the previous  four weeks, and that, assuming a building programme of 1,000,000 tons, an average of twenty large  ships  per week corresponded to a net loss of 4,000,000 tons per annum.     The  consequent  reduction of tonnage  and  the withdrawal of ships for naval, military, and Allied services are expected  to reduce the 1917 imports into the United Kingdom to approximately half those for 19.16.     Although such a drastic reduction must handicap the efficient prosecution of the war, the submarine campaign will probably hot exercise any decisive influence during the current year unless the rate of loss  is  furth er increased.  It will,  however, completely obliterate the reserves of British - shipping, and consequently the position at the beginning of 1918 will be precarious.      At  the end  of May 1917,  British tonnage  was allocated as follows in millions- of:-tons:   ;     -                 .;,-.&apos;.;--&apos;-.&quot;:-    &apos;\     &apos;.;&apos; .  , - - Y                 .      Army, 1*8 ; Navy, 1*75 ; vessels repairing,  launched, or completing, and vessels carrying out essential trade in distant waters, 1 &apos;3 ;  vessels fitted for carrying petroleum in bulk,  &quot;98;  colonial registered, tonnage  permanently  abroad,   &apos;85;   on  full -Government  service,  :*8,.-. of which ; one-half is  partly  available for cargo.   The remainder, 5&quot;9 tons, was available for trade with the;United Kingdom.   If the rate of loss is the same in the  second  half of the year, and is equally divided  between the services exposed to submarine attack, the tonnage available&quot; for trade at the beginning of 1918 will only be about 4&apos;9 million tons, and&apos;ships that are sunk after that can  only be replaced by new construction or by withdrawing ships from other essential services. Thus the total British tonnage available for trade at the beginning., of. 1918 will be approximately equal&apos; to the gross  sinkings  in  1917, assuming a continuance&apos;, of the present average.                    .     ,   . .             .  .      Although many  of the conflicting factors  on which the final result of the war depends cannot be foreseen with any degree of certainty, the probability now seems to be that if the present results of the submarine  attack on  Allied communications are maintained, and if the rate of new construction is not greatly increased, it will be the deciding factor in 1918.  &apos;.    &apos;   -   In  a .recent report  on the/subject of mercantile  shipbuilding, an output  of 3,0.00,000 tons from the United Kingdom is stated to be. reasonably possible.  This is a great advance on the figures, on which  the above remarks have been based.   The increased construction in the United States must also be taken into consideration.                                 Minor Operations.      Dunkirk  reports that the  machines of the Royal&apos;Naval Air Service tombed the following. places  on the  6tli  July :-Ghistelles, Gontrode airship shed,&apos; St. Denis, Westrum, and the railway near Lechtervelde.   Over 6 tons of bombs  were dropped and good shooting was made.;  A second attack was carried out on Ghistelle aerodrome on the 7th. . The bombing  flight was attacked in strength by hostile formations, but bombs  were dropped on the objective.   The Vice-Admiral, Mediterranean, also reports
&apos;C% a raid  by one of our aeroplanes on Constantinople.  Bombs  were dropped on the   . &quot; Sultan Selim &quot; (ex-1- Goeben &quot;), the German steamer &quot;General,&quot; and the War Office.        The laying of -deep mines in the vicinity of Portsmouth has been completed. SUMMARY OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Movements of German Merchant Ships.    To and 1 rom Norwegian ports :  Arrived, 2.

It is said that on the 10th June a German aeroplane with &quot;invisible wings &quot;carried out a practice flight, and1&apos;that she was invisible to the naked eye at 3,000 feet.    (b.) The following report has been received :-        &quot;It is understood that the British outcry for air reprisals was the subject of    a long and  important conference  at the Kaiser&apos;s  Headquarters last week.  The    result was that General von Hoeppner, the Commander-in-Chief of Germany&apos;s air    service, accompanied by a commission of aerial experts, inspected  the anti-aircraft    defences of the principal towns on the Rhine and inland towns, such as Karlsruhe,    Stuttgart, Munich, and Magdeburg.  The visit ended with a minute inspection of   : the air defences of the North Sea harbours, especially Emden, Wilhelmshaven,    and Heligoland.  The visit of inspection has been kept a secret  in order not to    alarm the public, who are terribly afraid of air reprisals.&quot;    (c.) According  to a German  officer, pilot of an aeroplane recently captured, thequality of the material used for the construction of German aeroplanes  and engines, isgradually deteriorating.  The primary cause of this state of affairs is the dearth ofraw material.  Certain parts,which would normally be  made of copper, are now madeof iron.   .                  - Y.Y;j;      :V/-, --. &apos;:&apos;Y                 y    (d.) It is reported that the Germans fear air raids with, incendiary bombs againsttheir forests  during harvest time, as large forest fires would not only do considerabledamage, but would  withdraw numbers  of men from harvesting operations in order toextinguish them.                                                         &apos;:-r^ff\?\    Naval Staff,  :&apos;:            -.              :.:-             \          &apos;: -        July 11,1917,  .&apos;                             --v^ -V.;-r./;.:.::.-
