        ,  v                                  Copy Ne*-*- ^\SEC R E T.                                         7th July, 1917,                THE &apos; DUTCH  SITUATION.       forward the following observations with reference to the    itioii raised by the Foreign Office at the War Cabinet meetingyesterday.1*   The&apos;general tendency in Holland would seem to be towardsneutrality.  The Dutch are making large sums of money, and willnot willingly jeopardise their position by definitely sidingeither with the Entente or&quot;with the Central Powers.,  At the.same time they always have the example of Belgium before thenuand realise their own weakness and the power of Germany, whomthey greatly fear. &apos; -                                .2*   Oh the other hand, Holland is most unlikely to declare waragainst the Entente on her own volition, even if she is subjectedto very heavy economic pressure, because she knows--that all herColonies and much of her shipping are at the mercy of the Ententeand that neither she herself nor any of the -Central Powers carprevent their capture. (Japan would foe only too glad to seizethe.Colonies),  If all cereals and fodder were stopped fromimport into Holland, the Dutch would&apos;soon be starving for wantof bread grain.  Provided, therefore, that the situation ishandled in such a way as to obviate all fear of a popular out-burst, it seems likely that the blockade could be made morestringent without causing Holland to declare war on the Entente.3 c    At the same time it would seem impolitic to pursue a polic3rof pin-pricks towards Holland, which may lead to such irritationas will drive her into the arms of our enemies.  She seems up tonow to have acted up to her engagements.  There, has foe on troubleabout potatoes, but as the Foreign Office pointed out to Sir-Walter Townley in their telegram of the&apos; 19th June last, thesituation is rendered difficult by the fact that neither the newpotatoes offered pari passu with the German supplies nor theold potatoes available for making up the deficiency for 1916                                                      can
can be stored for any length, of time,,, and shipping facilitiescannot immediately he found.  That is to say we are not in aposition tc take delivery, and consequently Germany is gettingher proportion of the potato-crop and we are not getting ours.4r    Prom a strictly military point of view it would of coursehe disadvantageous to the interests of the Entente if Hollandwere to become an enemy.   The whole of our secret servicewould at once break down, as it is through her that almost allour best Information is received,   Germanyfs man-power wouldbe increased by a population of over six millions, calculatedto be able to provide over 600,000 men beteeen the ages of19 and. 40 fit for military service,   The. Dutch Army could atonce supply a force of four divisions, amounting to 100,000men, which would however, require to be provided with heavyartillery, air-craft, and a much increased proportion ofmachine-guns,5,    The Admiralty can advise as to the naval effect, but itseems obvious that the position of Holland on the eastern sideof the North Sea would exercise a very considerable influenceon naval operations..   The Scheldt would at once become opento Germany, and would offer a fresh base for submarine attackson British shipping if Zeebrugge should have to be abandoned.The Triouth of the Rhine and the Dutch Frisian Islands alsooffer further submarine bases,6,    There is the further consideration that a war withHolland might cause trouble in South Africa.7.    Our only counter-balancing advantage would be theincreased power of tightening the blockade,8.    As far as Germany is concerned the economic advantagesto be derived from the entry of Holland into  the war on her                                                          side
7th July,  1917,                        tside depend largely uponvwhether she thinks that the war willlast much longer.   If so,  the advantages would be small asthe Dutch would be obliged to kill off their live stock owingto lack of forage and Germany would consequently be deprivedof the animal produce.   If,  however, the war is to be ashort one the immediate provision of meat will be advantageousto her,                            (signed)   W, R. ROBERTSON.                                         C.
