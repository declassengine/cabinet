SECRET ^:-:XX-xm^&apos;-&quot;                     WAR  CABINET.G.T. 1349                        ,  &apos; , /MEMORANDUM BY SIR ARTHUR- LEE ON&apos; LORD DERBY &apos;S PROPOSAL TO     DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY ALL SOLDIERS LENT FOR&apos;/:-&apos;&apos;.              .     WORK - ON THE LAND.    .. This policy, if accepted, would destroy the Agricultural Programme, which depends, above all, upon a reliable reinforce- ment of labour.  //;-Under War conditions the problem of farm labour is largely one of wages..   That is to say the maximum wages which the industry can afford to pay (from 25-30 shillings a week) are much too low to tempt anyone still in civil life.   All avail- able able-bodied labour, therefore, goes elsewhere./;:.;.::; //....*-&apos;/ Ey lending men from the Army this problem of wages is automatically solved, and without any real feeling of grievance. The work is recognised as being of unique national importance, and in itself is not unpopular. - especially with those accustomed to agricultural life.      The Army, having conscripted most of the able-bodied labour from the land, Is the only available source from which such labour can be.drawn or borrowed.   In this case it Is only sought to borrow it, for such period as national safety will permit and with the.understanding that-it can be withdrawn at any moment in event of grave emergency.   Despite Lord Derby1s contention, men whom the Military Authorities can instantly recall by telegram must obviously be of more value to the:Army than a similar number who would have to;be found, examined and enlisted.   y      Lord Derby&apos;s argument that the men will be mainly non-, agriculturalists of low category, if admitted, would be incompa- tible with the Cabinet decision, that, so.far as possible, men with agricultural experience are to be selected.   &quot;Cottcn-spinners weavers, etcvu.are&apos;not asked for by the Board of;Agriculture and are obviously unsulted to farm work.   In any case ,they are betuer;;fitted for work in factories, where much higher wages are paid, and If discharged from the Army,.- they would naturally not stay, on the land after-obtaining their freedom. /Any benefit, therefore/ resulting from their discharge, would ucci^ue to&apos;Munitions - not: to Agriculture.&quot;,/ /.-;&apos;v. VV;-; -/        &quot; - - &apos;     - - Lord&apos;Derbyf s concern and compunction about Industrial com-/ ;.; pulsion seem difficult to reconcile with his recent advocacy of&quot; raising, the military age/from 41 to-50..   It is only a few. weeks ago.that he urged.the Ecard of Agriculture to.join with him in./&quot;;.:/ pressing this change upon the Cabinet - . in; order&apos; that he 2r:-.ght be in;a position .to enlist- and.draft&apos;to the land a much.larger: supply /of . labour.&apos; - ; Nothing was said, then about Industrial Com-*: ;;:pulsion,,..or the Army becoming.&quot;an instriiraentcf oppression&quot;;.;;;;/:/;;.;. &quot;f Nor is it&apos; ea.sy to under stand why, if the loan cf .40,000 men////:; in the  spring (a service most- gratefully acknowledged) was -;/;&apos;:/&apos;.;/&apos;&apos;;/:&apos;..&apos;*/unobjectionable in principle, a loan of-twice the number In the    :/summer; should be constitutionally:improper and&apos; a violation of - personal liberty.
     :This dilemma, however,&quot;does not affect the main point.  TheCabinet has decided that &quot;the carrying out of the Agriculturalprogramme is of the greatest national importance&quot;, and has instruc-ted the War Office to provide the necessary labour.   If thisinstruction is not promptly carried Out, both in the letter andthe spirit, the Agricultural Programme will fail, and have to bedropped.   The risk of starvation will then have to be faced, and:;;;if disaster follows, the responsibility will rest upon those whorefused to agriculture the means by which alone it could producesufficient food either for the people or the Army.:;;-:^/:]\In conclusion, it Is necessary to emphasise that unless this Qquestion is finally settled without further delay, this autumn&apos;sploughing will be lost beyond recall, and that.if Lord Derby1sproposal is accepted, the Agricultural Programme must be abandonedaltogether..&apos;&quot;                :^;;&apos;f^:::;^:^.^(Signed)  A. LEE.July 7th,  1917.
