Intelligence Bureau,SECRET;Department of Information,TSEICLY  REPORT  ON  ITALY :. VIIFIW/VIIJuly 13th 1917.IilTKRirTIOI?&apos;!- -RELITIOIIS.    Ori June E7th H.M. AnbaesacTors ih Rome and Paris were instructed tourge that steps be taken to secure the evacuation of Eoirus both by theFrench and the Italian forces so soon as the new Government should bedefinitely established at Athens.   On the same day M. Venizelos dis-cussed the Italian occupation of ^annina with Signor BosgSL? and proposedthat, in view of the changed situation, the Greek authorities should bereinstated without delay.   He pointed out that the maintenance of theItalian occupations made more difficult his task of persuading the Greekpeople to make common cause with the Allies.   The Italian 1,&apos;inister issaid to have been sympathetic and to have undertaken to advise hisGovernment in the sense desired./  On July 3rd Sir Rennell Rodd reportedthat the Italian Minister at Athens had received the necessary instruc-tions and had established friendly relations with M. Venizelos, withwhom he proposed to deal directly.   The Italian Minister for ForeignAfiairs anticipated no difficulty in coming to an understanding concernsing Eoirus.                       : :  &apos;.    But.an understanding with M. Venizelos was hardly possible unless aprevious understanding should have been arrived at with&apos;the FrenchGovernment,  the action in U.  Epirus having been dictated by fears not somuch of Venizelcss as of French ambitions.  -    On June 28th the French Ambassador at&quot;Rome received instructions tocome to an understanding with the Italian.Government as to the limits ofterritory occupied respectively by French and Italian forces in Epirus.presumably no less embarrassing to M.  venizelos&apos;  policy than that ofThe presence of French or British troops on Greek territory being
Italian^ and&apos; the Italian oecunQtions having been represented ss  on  thelame footing with the French and 3ritish ,the logical solution would  belfound: in a general ivithdrawal of foreign garrisons from Greek territory,ftnd this it seems1 is likely to; be the course adopted.I   On -the; wider question of a general reconciliation&apos;and- harmonising of(territorial ambitions  between Venizelos and Venizelist opinion on thejone hand and the Italian Government and Italian oninion on the  other the[prospect aeems less hopeful. / S ich a reconciliation is advocated  by the Democratic press of Italy - notably the Secolo, which foilows up its interview with Venizelos of last December(seeV/eekly; Henort on; Italy VI, 0,5. ) by an interview with M. Hikhalakopoulos  (Minister of. Public  Works and a staunch adherent of Venizelos).     The Greek Minister;welcomed the expressions used by Baron  Sonnino in the Chamber in regard to Greece. -  The principles embodied in this were in perfect accord; with the views expressed by Venizelos to the  Secolo . &quot;Greece&quot;,:he said,;&quot;was quite rfcady to enter into discussions with a view to the desired -accord.&quot;      If the orticles quite recently published by the Giornale  d1  Italia at all reflect Sonnino Vs opinions&amp;such:an accord is still a long way off, ?he Nationalist organ of course also adopts a highly sceptical  and con- tempt tous attitude towards these Venizelist olive-branches. INTERNAL  POLITICS /%V                WWXK        &apos;                   ; ;;&quot; &quot;    There are indications of more pronounced revolt on. the part&apos; of the more democratic elements in the &quot;interventionist&quot;  block against the extreme imperialism of the Nationalist Wing.   In last week1s Report it was noted how SonninoTs speeches of June 20th rnd in Secret  Session    been interpreted as denoting a revision and modification of It:,ly&apos;s v/sr-aims.   A Deputy described the former speech: as &quot;eminently&apos; possibil ;? ist: and taking account of the situation crented in the Country; by  two

The Russian Revolution and tile, adhesion of America  to  the cause of the Allies have no doubt al30 had their, effect in producin  laot so much a peace-at-any-price atmosphere as s reinforcement of that   -      -                       sees                .-V-:-&quot;.o:-..0&apos;w-:::  section of public opinion -which/in international solidarity and organise  .on the best hope of durable neace and is prepared to submit national-.  3laims to the verdict of a plebiscite.
