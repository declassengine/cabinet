To.      D.K.I.     .1220          Tiie offensive on the S.W* front has coie to astand-still.  The General Staff here are unaware of thereason, hut hope it is only temporary.   People here are,  Xam afraid, expecting too much from the offensive,  andinclined to forget the condition of the Army.   In view of theforces available and their morale^what has already been doneis a great achievement.  During the first day of offensive itis said that the Germans dropped proclamations among theRussian Troops to the effect that the offensive was orderedagainst the wish of the Provisional Government and the Councilof i;/orkmen and soldiers&apos;deputies.   After a very stormymeeting lasting 9 hours the Petrograd Council of workmen andsoldiers1 deputies passed a resolution by 472 votes to 271(with 39 abstentions) approving of the proclamation issued bythe All-Russian Conference Councils of Y/orkmen and soldiers1deputies referred to in my^l206.     The Bolshevik! are doingall in their power to work people up against the offensive,but although they had it all their own way in thedemonstration held last Sunday,  since the announcement ofthe offensive,  demonstrators in favour of the Governmentand the Allies have had it all their own way.   The Commanderof the petrograd military district has been forced to issuean order against soldiers using force against street orators.One case occurred on Sunday.  On that occasion men of thePavlovsk regiment tried to interfere with a demonstrationin favour of the Allies which was being held outside theBritish Embassy.*  Stating that so long as war continues everything   must be done to increase the fighting power of the   Russian Army and that a separate peace or armistice   is not admissible.
