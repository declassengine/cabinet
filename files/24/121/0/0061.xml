GENERAL.The reports for the past week indicate very little change in the general industrial position. The increases which have occurred in the Employment Exchange Live Registers are to be chiefly ascribed to the re-registration of applicants who are entitled to a further period of benefit under the new Unemployment Insurance Act. The position in the iron and steel industry is still very unsatisfactory; an extension of short-time working is occurring in Scotland, while at Sheffield the position is growing worse week by week, and it is anticipated that there will be a prolongation of the usual holiday period at Easter. Skilled workmen are still being paid off from the shipbuilding yards, and very little new work is being undertaken. At several of the ports the workmen are engaged almost entirely on casual repair work. No prospect of any improvement in the textile and clothing industries is yet reported, but the slight revival in the boot and shoe industry is maintained, though very few orders are being received from abroad. The outlook in the pottery trade is becoming less favourable, and during the week a number of pottery workers commenced short-time. In the carpet trade employment continues normal. Unemployment is still increasing among fishermen, while among transport workers the position remains unchanged.II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shail also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport.ROAD WORK PROGRAMME.(Information supplied by the Ministry of Transport.)(1.)

(6.) VISCOUNT ST.

The restriction in regard to road work has since been removed.Works are approved only in areas where serious unemployment exists which is not otherwise provided for. Preference in employment is given to ex-Service men. Grants do not exceed 60 per cent, of the wages bill of additional unemployed men engaged, and the works undertaken are such as are approved by the appropriate Government Departments as suitable works of public utility.Up to the 18th March 529 applications for grants had been sanctioned in respect of 190 Local Authorities. The total sum allocated under these sanctions was  809,035.Returns from fifty-nine Local Authorities in the greater London area and 171 Local Authorities in the provinces show that the labour engaged on schemes towards which a grant has been made is as follows : (a.)

(9.) SUMMARY OF LABOUR ENGAGED ON RELIEF SCHEMES.1.

Public Works put in hand by Local Authorities ivithoutGovernment grants  ...        ...        ...        ... 12,967Grand Total 79,881As reports for the week ended the 11th March have been received from only 230 Local Authorities out of 291 who were asked to supply information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a. number of men in excess of 80,000.(The Ministry of Transport estimate that there are also some 20,000 men employed on road maintenance and repair work over and above those ordinarily so employed.)(10.) UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, brought the number of insured persons up from 4,000,000 to 12,000,000 and increased the rates of benefit to 15s. for men and 12s. for women. Benefit could be drawn for fifteen weeks in any insurance year. In order to meet the needs of newly insured workers the Act provided for the payment of eight weeks&apos; benefit as soon as four contributions had been paid. Owing to the amount of unemployment which existed at the time the Act commenced, this provision was found to be inadequate, and by a short Act, which came into operation on the 23rd December, 1920, payment of eight weeks&apos; benefit was authorised up to the 31st March, 1921, on evidence of employment during 1920 being furnished. Owing to the number of insured workers unemployed and exhausting their benefit and the additional fact that the out-of-work donation scheme under which upwards of 300,000 ex-Service men are drawing donations terminates on the 31st March the Unemployment Act, 1921, was passed through Parliament and became law on the 3rd March. Under the Act the rate of benefit is raised to 20s. for men and 16s. for women, while benefit may be drawn for sixteen weeks in each of two periods running from the 3rd March to the 2nd November, 1921, and from the 3rd November to the 2nd July, 1922; after the 2nd July, 1922, benefit may be drawn to the extent of twenty-six weeks in each insurance year. This benefit may be drawn irrespective of the payment of contributions provided applicants can show that they were employed in an insurable occupation in each of twenty weeks since 1919. In the case of ex-Service men the number of weeks employment required is ten only, and in appropriate cases the requirement may be waived altogether on the recommendation of the Local Employment Committee.
