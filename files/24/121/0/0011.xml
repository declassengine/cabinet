X88. Mr. Thomas Shaw - To ask the Minister of Labour, whether a oinference was held at the Ministry if Labour on 7th April, 1920 respecting tho establishment of a trade board in the textile simll-ware industry;   whether investigations have been preceding in this trade since that date;   whether complaints have been received from the unions concerned as to the low rate of wages and, in particular, a letter froa the National Federation of Women Workers, dated Oth November, 1920) stating that oorfcaia w^mpjn engaged on tin manufacture of small silk tassels wore receiving a wago of 12s. a week;   and whether ho can state at what date it is hoped to establish a trade board in this tradeP (Thursday 17th March).*S89. Mr. Thomas Shaw - To aBk tho Minister of Labour,whether a conference w*\s held on trade board;?, at the Ministry cf Labour on 20th January, 1919; whether the Minister circulated to thy members cf that- coherence a list of ths trades to which by proposed to apply the Trade Boazd Acts;   whether that list included decorative needlework and embroidery;   whether, in December, 1920, he stated in a circular t*? the associations interested that he was anxious to set up a trade board in the embioidery trade with the least possible dolay;   and whether ho can now state when it is proposed to proceed with the establishment of that trade board.   (Thursday 17th Maroh,)With regard to the first two questions I should propose to reply an lines of the reply that I gave to Mr. Higham on the 9th Maroh.    I should say in effect that the Government was bound at the present moment tc have regard to the general industrial situation and must accordingly proceed with caution. The result of this policy would be that a considerable number of ex-Officers appointed for the purpose of wide extsnsion of the Trado Board movement would become redundant.    I should of course add that every step would be taken to attempt to find them other employment.With regard to the latter three questions, however, I must ask for Cabinet guidance as to the reply that I should make. The three questions do substantially set out the actual facts of the situation.   It is the case that the late.&apos;Minister of Labour did state categorically that he proposed to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the catering trade. It is further the faot that in accordance with that undertaking  a draft Order was circulated during the summer of last year.   It may be noted in passing that so far as
this trade is concerned an application v;as made for an inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act to the prime Minister in January, 1920, and that this was rofusod by the Prime Minister^ Secretary on the advice of the Depainmost in yjew of the Tact that Trade Boards were to be estsbljobcd in the T?-ane,It is also the fact that a conference was held in respect of the Textile Small-ware Industry as long ago as the 7th April, 1920, and it is undoubtedly the case that this is the sort of trade to which the 190 9 ict could have been applied, because it is in tho real sense of the word in some areas still a &quot;sweated1 industry,,It is finally tho fact that the late Minister of Labour did on the 20th January, 1919 circulate a list of trades to which it was hoped to apply tho Trade Boards Acts in which the decorative needlework aid embroidery trade was included, subject in that case to the reservation that the Acts would only be applied if investigation chewed that they were properly applicable0As a result of tho investigation work already completed, I am in a position to apply the Acts to the catering trades involving the Betting up of three Boards in England and Wales and three in Scotland, if the Cabinet are prepared to sanction this course,   But even here certain further inquiries will still have to be dj2.de and as the negotiations are not complete, the Trade Boards could not..in any event be set up for some little time.    Moreover, it will be remembered . that even when notice of the intention to set up the Board is given, a further   40 days mast elapse during which objections may be lodged.So far as the textiles cniallware-D industry and the decorative needlework and embroidery trades are concerned, the investigations have not proceeded far enough to enableI me
me to give any undertaking to sat up the Boards in these trades within a reasonable period.   On the basis of the Cabinet deoision I should have to reply to these two questions that in the present circumstances the Government are not prepared to proceed with Trade 3oard3 in these trades.feeling already aroused in labour circles at the reply given to Mr. Higham in accordance with the Cabinet decision.   I pointed out at the mooting of the Cabinet that, in adopting this policy, the Government were directly challenging the Labour Party on a part of their programme to which they attach very groat importance, and the questions I have quoted above are the first indication of the attitude which the Labour Party will adopt,    I understand, unofficially, that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress will press for an emergency mooting with the PrimeMinister on this subject some day a^srfe- week. And I ought to warn my colleagues that at any rate so far as the Textile Small-ware Trade is concerned they will produce damaging figures as to the low wages actually being paid at tho present moment.I should add that it might be possible by a rearrangement of staff, and without additional expenditure beyond that sanctioned in 33timates (a matter which I am submitting to tho Treasury) to deal with these trades in 6 to 9 months,   But it must be remembered that these are only two of the trades in respect of which similar pressure will certainly be applied.(l) Orders have already been made to apply the Trade Boards Acts to the following trades:- ish Distributive Fruit Distributive HairdressersBoot and Floor Polish &quot;Manufacture &apos;  Whip Making,I propose to proceed forthwith to the setting up of these Boards.This reply would, of necessity, increase the strong
No additional financial liability is involved beyond the authority I already possess.^These oases are, I take it, outside the Cabinet decision wBn quoted at the beginning of this memorandum.(2) Notice of Intention to apply the Act has been given inHeat DistributiveLace Warehousing and Finishing.Unless tho volume of objection causes me to reconsider the situation I propose to issue the orderapplying the Trade Board Aota in these cases and to constitute the Boards..   If I issue tho ordors, again,n^ additional financial liability is involved beyond &quot;the sanctions I already have. (In pursuanco of cabinet decision &quot;B&quot; I want authority for this).(3) Considerable work of Investigation, prior toformal aotion under the Acts, has been carried out intho following trades, and these trades could be proceeded with, though slowly, without additional expenditure.Drapery Retail Distributive Trade ]/ien&apos;a and Boys&apos; Retail Outfitting DistributiveTrade,Boot and Shoo Retail Distributive Trade.I propose so to proceed, with a view to the issuo of a Notice of Intention to apply the Acts, if desirable, after full consideration of tho present difficult circumstances, (Again, in pursuance of Cabinet decision &quot;Bn I want authority for this.)(4) Considerable pressure has heen brought to bear on the Department to apply the Aoto to other trades. Amongst these, I propose to proceed with the work of investigation prior to issue of Hotioe of Intention -if considered desirable - in the following trades:-
Textile Small Wares Embroidery. Catering Trades.In these cases at least three months will be taken up in investigation.   If Notice of Intention was thereafter issued, forty days would elapse before tho Order was Issued, if made.   From that point onwards four to six months would elapse in tho establishment of the Board.If all these ore to be proceeded with so as to give reasonable progress an additional expenditure for staff would probably be incurred beyond the amount already sanctioned by the Treasury - in estimates 1981-22 - say round about  2,500.   (Again, with reference to the Cabinet decision( I ask authority toproceed in those nasesj(Signed) I. J. MOMIABA.Ministry of Labour, 14.3.21.
