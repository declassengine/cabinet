I : TI-&quot;:?. K.0?&apos;3.?Y 0? HICP. 2746.Copy ifo,&quot;LIOFT ?.any/AYS,W&apos;*eifiorandan bv the minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.With reference to the note &quot;by the Secretary of theCabinet (C.P. 2590), covering the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment with regard to Light Railwaya, I should like to point out that the position, so far as this Department is concerned, in respect of the two schemes which Sr. Maonamara suggests should he put in hand,, is that they may be expected to yield a fair return on the expenditure and would be of considerable advantage to agriculture in the districts they would serve. When the Ministry of Transport had funds available for development schemes, we supported these proposals.   As those funds have now been surrendered, and in view of the need for economy, I do not feel able to press that the schemes should be carried out at present, particularly as, from a purely agricultural point of view, there are several other districts in which the need for additional transport facilities is   much greater.   In consequence, I support the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in hie memorandum CP. 2703,(Intld.)::arch 19th, 1921.
