&quot;it is desirable that the segregations -shoui^      made and promuJ. ga-Wd before the oofianexioement of the elections in order that the Returning Officers and other persona conoern^iuay^fajadliarise themselves with the new procedure.It will be observed that the draft Order in  Council which is appended in the form approved by the Committee, also enables the Government to issue an Order in Council relative to the appointment of a fie?/ Lord Meutenant,    Whe Ucmirdttee saw no objection to power being &quot;taken to appoint a Lord Lieutenant on, or after, the 19th April na;d)r-^u1rtb^^ that there..may be some political objectionto thia course.
