Mili*tary aspect of ocnrizpation has bean mc-st carefully examined by Generals (kmgr-ere and &quot;tedcliffa.   Garrison required at Amman would be one battalion two squadrons and two guns.   This is considered in every way adequate to con-trol country tc avoid risk to troops.   General I^adcliffe is telegraphing separately to Chief of General Stpff on this subject,   This will entail on increase for next six months only cf one Indian battalion and one Indian cavalry regiment.   By end of year local forces will be sufficiently trained to relieve troops now in Northern Palestine to extent of this increase.   Thus only additional obaz^e -involved is cost for six months estimated at  153,000.   ,Part III.   Military arrangements for occupation of Trans-Jordania proceed on assumption that we reach satis-feotory arrangement with Abdullah and that either he will become a governor in our nase under High Commissioner of Palestine or that someone agreeable to him will undertake this task with his aoproval and support.   1&apos;here is no alternative to this policy as we cannot contemplate hostilities with Abdullah in any circumstances.    7e must therefore p ^ooeed in .co-operation and accord with him.     On the other hand with best will in the world Abdullah will not be able to restrain his people from disturbing the French and even making war upon them unless he is at once fortified and restrained by presence of a British force which must be strong enough to provide for its own safety. You will see how this development of policy is a definite part of general policy of friendship end co-operation with Sherifian influence and how it harmonises with plan we are endeavouring to pursue in Mesopotamia.Part IV./
Part IV*     I have no doubt whatever ofter hearing cose fully cet out by Hirrh Commissioner and b^ General Conrrevc end fortified \rr views of Colonel Lawrence that occupation of Trons-Jordania on be.sic of an arrangement with Abdullah is right policy for us to adopt and that it will afford best prospect of discharge of our responsibilities with future reduction of expense *     In this connection statement mode in House of Commons as reported in Router that Palestine costs seven millions is not concurred in by Mr. Croslrnd.   Total amount in estimates of 1921-22 is not expected to exceed four millions and of this a large proportion arises out of arrears and terminal charges due to India on repatriation and demobil-ization of large number of troops already reduced from this theatre-    For 1922-23 principle is accepted by all that cost Palestine garrison including Trans-Jordania will not exceed two millions and. this will be further reduced as local forces aro trained and assume responsibility.   Thus if my policy of an arrange ment with Shorifians is accepted and successfully carried Palestine and Mesopotamia together ought not to require more than eight millions as against thirty millions in present year.   And for this reduced sum it is honed to discharge all obligations of our maxidato.Part v.     I am to meet Abdullah at Jerusalem on Monday March 28th and I request authority to approach him and if possible settle with him on line above set forthi   Thus you would be able to say to French:- &quot;so far from our acquiescence in a Feisal candidature for Mesopotamia, if locally desired, being an embarrassment to you it is in fact through our concomitant arrangements with Abdullah in Trans-Jordania surest means of securing you from annoyance and disturbance from Arabs in south&quot;m)t Whitehall Gardens, S.-&quot;. March 21st, 1921.
