Circulated by the Secretary of State for India,SECRET.I circulate to my colleagues copies of two telegrams which I have received from the Viceroy on the subject of the Turkish Peace.E. S. M.15th March 1921.Telegram from. Vieerou to Secretary of State for India, datedlilh March 11)21.Following resolution was moved by Sir Zuliiqar Ali Khan in Council of State on 3rd March. &quot; This Council recommends to the Governor-General in Council that ho will be pleased to address the Secretary of State for India with the object of securing that full consideration is given to public opinion in this country before any matter is decided in which the religious susceptibilities of any class of Mis Majesty&apos;s subjects in India are concerned. Amendment to above was moved by Saiyid Raza Ali, who suggested that the words &quot; by His Majeslys Government &quot; on the KhiJafat question, be substituted for the words, beginning, &quot; Before any matter,&quot; to the end. Raza Ali said resolution, as thus amended, would embody Indian point oil view, especially of the Moslems, in a better form perhaps than Zulliqar Airs gratefully acknowledged sympathy extended to Muliannnadau feeling, both by his countrymen, and by the European community in India, official and non-oflicial. Had no quarrel with the Government of India, but criticisms directed against the Home Department, Govorn-ment of India. Had laid views of Indian Muslims before Parliament, but had completely failed to influence policy. Cabinet&apos;s failure adequately to appreciate Muslim sentiment he attributed to the non-inclusion of a Muslim representative in London.&apos;1. Conferences of 1917 and 1918, having regard to momentous issues at stake, and to religious nature of problems involved, maintained that plain, duty of Government of India and Home Government to have insisted on a Muslim representative at those meetings. Error responsible for prevailing discontent among Mahomedans. Cabinet bad also (? all omitted) along treated Indian Muslim sentiment in a manner that was bound to create unrest. Welcomed the despatch of Mahommedan deputation to England, including two Sunuis. He felt that some regard should be paid to unanimous demands of Muslims, as with cases of citizens of a self-governing Dominion. Foreign Secretary doubted wisdom of mover&apos;s tactics, and thought that there was no need to discuss a topic on which the House had already passed its full opinion during the debate on Bhurgris Resolution, held on 21st February, copy of which sent to you by last mail. Zulfiqar Aii Khan still thought his resolution justified. Honourable Member said it would be a work of supererogation to ask you now to secure full consideration be given to public opinion in India, but were prepared to send you a copy of Debate, and an abstract of it by telegram. With this undertaking, resolution and amendment was withdrawn. We regret delay in cabling summary. It has been due to late receipt of Council proceedings. Even now we have only proof copy before us.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated lilh March 1921.Private. I have received a long letter from the Begum of Bhopal on the subject of the Turkish Peace terms. &quot; After dwelling on unsatisfactory features of Treaty of Sevres, she says that it has wrought terrible mischief by creating two wide-spread impressions, (.1) that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in contrast to Government of India, are absolutely hostile to Turkey&apos;s cause, and (2) that view of Government of India, and consequently opinion of India itself, does not carry, in Imperial Councils, weight to which it is entitled. Removal of these impressions, which are responsible for all agitation will tend to restore normal conditions. After quoting His Royal Highness&apos;s farewell words, beginning &apos; the voice of India has not carried the weight, and does 3568-1     100 3/21
not carry the weight, which India has a right to claim. To my mind, the outstanding merit of india&apos;s new constitution is, that the view of the Government of India must henceforth weigh more heavily in the scale, as more truly representing the Indian point of view, than it has done in the past.&apos; Her Highness pleads for stroke, of bold -imaginative statesmanship in favour of Turkey&apos;s cause. Only by giving unmistakable proof of His Majesty&apos;s Governments regard lor unanimous wish of teeming millions of India, can impression of British hostility to aboriginal countries be removed, lieuter has emphasised desire of France for revision, and consequently Moslems regard His Majesty&apos;s Government as tho only obstacle. This is extremely unfortunate, in view of situation in Egypt, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Persia and Afghanistan. World situation is so very abnormal that it calls lor exceedingly bold statesmanship in British Empire, and matters have reached such a stage in this country that it is important to deal with the Khalifat question in consonance with wishes of Moslem community. Great Britain&apos;s (? reputation) has always stood high for the devotion to Moslem interests, and a notable proof of her steadfastness at this difficult time cannot fail to strike the imagination and capture the hearts of Islamic world.&quot;1 leave you to make the best use of this well-worded and moderate appeal.
