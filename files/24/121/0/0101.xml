GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.The general situation remains unchanged.   Small attacks on lorrios and patrols made by rebels armed with bombs or revolvers occur almost daily, but in the past week there has been only one encounter leading to serious loss to the Crown Poroos.   This occurred at Rosoarberry, Co. Cork, where the Police Barracks were attached by a large body of rebels who blew down the front of the barracks.   The fight lasted for two hours, at the end of which time the R.I.C. had been forced into one room.   When this room took fire, the surviving police managed to escape.   Two constables were killed and three wounded.   All the arms and ammunition, except two rifles, were either captured or burnt.In Dublin there have been two attacks on Motor lorries in the streets.   In one instance a R.A.F. lorry carrying one unarmed driver was attacked.   This lorry was burnt.   In the second instance, no military casualty resulted, but three rebels are believed to have been wounded.   The details will be found in Appendix I.There has been another instance of the mureer ox an officer in the streets in Dublin, Captain bees, Roserve of Officers, being shot in Exchequer Street,The discovery of arms and explosives in Dublin oontinues. On March 30th, one Lewis Gun and one Machine Gun of German pattern were seized together with 5,000 rounds of revolver ammunition, during a search in Harcourt Street.   During another search in Dublin throe revolvers, 25 bombs and various kinds of ammunition including some dum-dura rounds,
r r* ab b 6were seized.Outrages on the Hallways lia-ye been confined chiefly to- the burning or looting of roods from BelfastaOne attempt has been made to derail a special troop train, and there has been one instance of a Railway Bridge being &quot;blows up.Recently, outrages by the rebels have been with increasing frequency directed towards obtaining money0   In Appendix I of this report will be found several cases where the stealing of money was evidently the Objects,   This seoms to bear out thorumour that tho rebels funds are in need of replenishment,.Information has been received from London and through theAdmired Commandcr-in-Chief, the Western Approaches, to the effect that 250,000 rifles have been -purchasod by Sinn -Fein Agents in Italy, through the medium of D^nunzio, and that these arms wore loaded at f-enoa about March 9th for Irelando Ho sign of the ship or ships has been seen by the Navy so far as I have hearde   If tho story is true I consider it important, and shall be glad to receive any verification or contradiction of ito     It will be remembered that some months ago the Boman Oatholic Bishop of Cork - the Most Rev0 Dr. Cohalan, D0D0 -created some surprise and gained a certain amount of appro-bat ion from- moderate people, by denouncing murder and threat-ening to excommunicate murderers0   The occasion of Dr0CohalanTs action was the murder of some Roman Catholics in his diocese0 3ince then the murder of members of His Majestyrs forces and of Protestants has been frequent in the Diocese, in connection with which certain rebels have been convicted of murder and executeuo   Dr, Cohalan, however, so far from denouncing these murders or carrying out his threat regarding the perpetrators, has used all his power to ensure that the murderers should receive the full benefits of the Church, which appears hardly coompatible with excommunication^The cutting of roads an&apos;, destruction of bridges shows no sign of decreasing although the local inhabitants are reported
to be objecting to this interference with their trade.I am oi opinion that the men at the head of the rebel movement are making great efforts ju3t now by sending organisers and extremists from Dublin, to stir up the local bodies of the I.R.A, to further activities where there are signs of things becoming quiet.&apos; By this means they hope to counter any attempt on our part to gradually localise the rebellion.   The result of this has been a certain impetus to local companies of I.a.A. in districts in the 5th.Divisional Area.(8d) O.F.H&apos;.liAOHBADY.General, Commanding-in-Ohief, Ireland.G.H.Q.
