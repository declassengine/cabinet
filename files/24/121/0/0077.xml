SU..SIARY 0? THE R30 WW.DATIONS CO-NTAlNSI) IN THS REPORT Off T:iD 5^h&quot;)CT COLIHITr^S ON IO 3EHST 3X?^SBS .(1) Salaries.-    The Committee considered the amount of the present salary and also the question whether the wholo  4oo or any part thereof should be treatod as expenses for purposes of Income Tax.The Committee recommended that no change should &quot;ce mado in the amount of the present salary.It observed that since 1912,  100 of the  400 has been treatod as provided for expenses and paid free of Income Tax and that it is open to the Treasury un&amp;or section 3 of the Finance Act, 1913, to issue a minute without further legislative sanction to the effect that the whole  400 or any part thereof should be treated as expenses, but it made no recommendation on this subject.It was impressed by the evidence submitted of the difficult financial position of certain.members at tho present time, and was. satisfied that further consideration should be given to this matter In the near future, but in ?iew of the -present position considered it inadvisable to make any specific recommendation at this time.(2) Travelling Expenses.     The Committee noted the inequality of expenses.&apos; between- a Member for a London constituency and a Member whose constituency is situated at a distance from Westminster, and it was agreed that this inequality ought to be rectified.     It also considered whether free .passes should be issued to Members between London and their constituencies,., or,.. at their&apos; option, to their home address.. .It recommended that first, class railway travelling should be provided for all Members of parliament to be available between, the terminus station in London and tneir constituencies but it did- not feel justified in recommending that similar facilities should be made available for- Members between their homes and London..Since........,,
(Since the Report of the Select Committee was pub-lished,.. I have received a letter from Mr. Arthur Henderson on this subject which has been circulated to the Cabinet - C.p.2655).(3) Postage.     &quot;Evidence was submitted to the Committee shewing a considerable increase in the correspondence of Members.     The Committee considered whether(i)   when a Government Department replies to a communication from a Member of Parliament, a franked envelope should be enclosed for a reply to be forwarded to tho constituent;(ii)   whether Members should be supplied weekly with a certain numeor of franked envelopes for their official correspondence;(iii)   whether tho Postmaster at the House ofCommons should be empowered to frank a certain number of letters from Members each week.The Committee considered that there were objections to each of these proposals but recommended that facilities should bo provided for the free postage of Members - letters.
