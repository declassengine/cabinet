CABINET.present position-op the russiax trade negotiations.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I have had an interview with ICr. Krassin, who ha3 just returned from Russia, and has submitted draft amendments to the trade agreement, la copy of which is attached (Annex A) .   It will be seen that they iinvolve(a) a declaration that the British Government will refrain from action hostile to Soviet Russia in a considerable number of specified countries.(b) a declaration that both parties to the agreement engage to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, of Afghanistan and of the territory of the Turkish National Assembly,(c) an undertaking by the British Government that it will not aid anti-Soviet claimants to the Government of Russia cr Govern-ments of former Russian territory not recognised by the Soviet Government.(d) a definite description of the future      general treaty to be negotiated as a tpeaoe1 treaty.(e) an undertaking to give to Russian ships the same facilities of free navigation on the high seas and elsewhere that are accorded to the ships of other nationalities.(f) a clause definitely giving the right to the Russian Soviet Government to terminate the trade agroemont if the proposed test case in respect of gold goes against the Russians.(g) the omission of the first paragraph of the Declaration deal-ing with the Recognition of Claims - but this it is understood, Mr. Erassin does not press.Subject to the above, the agreement as proposed by tho British Ivemment consistingof fourteen clauses and a Declaration on ,e Recognition of Claims ha,s been accepted by the Soviet Government,
Of these   proposed Amendments (e) and (f) raise no difficulties of principle, and (f) embodies the substance of a statement made by me in a letter to Mr. Krassin on the gold question which he       received prior to   his departure for Russia (see Annex C).As regards (a) Mr. Krassin claims that the enumeration of oountries is in accordance with an undertaking given to him by the Prime Minister at the meeting in Mr. bonar  Law&apos;s room at the House of Commons on December 31s&amp;-- in which he was informed that the British Government insisted on the inclusion of a reference to the willingness of the Soviet Government to cease propaganda in Asia Minor^ Persia, Afghanistan and India.    The proposals in (b) and (c) obviously introduce entirely new issues.I understand that Mr. Krassin has now plenipotentiary powers and is himself anxious to bring the negotiations to a rapid and successful conclusion.I should like to have the guidance of the Cabinet.R. S. HOKNE.11th March, 1921,

ABIIBSBS 0.CONFIDENTIAL.&quot;iou asked me to put in writing the substance of v;hat I stated at our recent meeting on the question of gold$ &quot;You will understand that though there is a prohibition on the export of gold there is no prohibition on its import, and that the arrangements we can make for dealing with Russian gold must depend upon the establishment of title in this country, and the recognition of title else-where.   Until this is done the gold must be subject to such orders as the Courts of the United Kingdom may pronounce in accordance with the usual judicial procedure. So far as we are concerned, the first stop to securing this end is obviously to bring a small parcel of gold to this country as a baBis for a test action,   xou asked me what we would be prepared to do in the event of this course being taken, and (a) of the title to the gold being definitely established in this country and accepted elsewhere, or (b) in the event of a decision being given by a Court of First Instance only, in the United Kingdom, that the title of the Russian Soviet Government to the gold cannot be competently disputed.   To these questions I am in a position to give you a specific reply at once.(a) In the event of suoh a final deoision being given, and followed elsewhere, so as to allow of Russia obtaining a sale for her gold in the world market, we should have no objection to the grant of re-export licences, without limit of time, in respect of Russian gold imported under the arrangement outlined below, subjeot always to the right of the Bank of England to purchase such gold at a mutually acceptable price not higher than the world market price.(b) Pending the final settlement Of the question of title and its recognition in the world market, the following are the immediate arrangements which the British .  .. Government is prepared to make with regard to Russiangold (other than British and allied coins) after the test action as to the title to the gold has been decided in the British Court of First Instance In favour of the Russian Soviet Government.(1)   Without prejudice as to title and ownership, imports of Gold from Russia exported by or on behalf of the Russian Soviet Government under the present arrangements may be consigned in parcels ox not less than 25,000 ounces for delivery at the bank of England., who shall be notified of such consignments prior to shipment,(8)   Suoh paroels shall be held for safe custody by the Bank of England who, without assuming any responsibility, and subject to payment of all out-of-pocket expenses, are to export each parcel to suoh destination as the consignee or a person designated by such consignee may direct*   Fail-ing such export within six months from the date of the arrival of the Gold at the Bank, the Gold is either to be sold \o the bank at a price to be mutually agreed, or to be sold in the market by the Bank for export for account of the consignee or this,nominee.   Should export be sus-pended for any .period owing to attachment; by the Court any such period shall not be oounte^^a %g aforesaid six months, . &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos; &apos;board op thaib ,Great George Street, //westminster, S*y.l.11th January, 1921.
(3) The Bank of England will have a standing licence for the re-export of Gold imported under these arrangements and remaining in their custody., and will make no charge for their services beyond the cost of freight, insuranoe, carriage, and other expenses incurred by them including charges on the usual basis for melting and assaying, if this is desired by the consignee or his nominee,(4) Gold imported under these arrangements is not at any time whilst in this country to pass out of the control of the Bank of England,(5)   In the event of the British Government desiring to modify its general Gold Policy in such a way as to make the above arrangements impracticable, the Russian Soviet Government may claim six months1 notice before such modification takes effect. It is understood that in the event of such notice being given the Russian Government will be at liberty to give immediate notice to terminato the Trade Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that the twelve months period specified in Article XIII of that Agreement may not have expired.It is of course understood that the object of the present arrangements being to facilitate and extend trade between the United Kingdom and Russia in accordance with the Trade Agreement, all gold imported under these arrangements is to be used to pay or to secure the payment for goods purchased in the United Kingdom and in particular for goods the product or manufacture of the British Lrapire,I am,iours faithfully, (Sgdo) RoSo Home,M, Krassin,Russian Trade Delegation,* 128, Hevj Bond Street, W.1,    .
