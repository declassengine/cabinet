THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 s GOVERNMENT^SECRET.jP.P.8776.I cabinet report BY THE GENERAL OFFICER C01vfl;IANDINC-in-CHIEF ON THESITUATION III IRELAND FOR &quot;/e.c. ENDING 26th MARCH,    1921.(Circulated by the Seoretary of State for War).GENERAL MILITARY SITUATION.There has been no marked change in the situation during the past week.In the oountry three serious collisions have occurred &quot;between Crown foroes and rebels, the details of whioh will be found in Appendix I. of this report.    Ambushes such as that at Headfort Junotion are diffioult to compete with, as the circumstances make tt impossible to take the protective measures whioh are normally taken for troops on the road.   It makes little difference whether the troops are oonoentrated in one or two carriages or distributed; for the rebels, being indifferent to the casualties inflicted on civilians, fire in-discriminated along the train*    A3 no warning of attack is possible, the first volley is bound to oause many oasualties. In the present case the preparation of the ambush must have taken considerable time, for banks and a fcuilding were prepared as a cover,   yet no word of this reached the nearest police or military post.    The few men of the Royal Fusiliers who remained unwounded after the first volley, fought extremely well without an officer or non-ooramissioned officer and no arms or amm-cnition were lost.The ambushing of the party of the 9th Lancers near Strokastown, in the Athlone Area, resulted in the death of two officers and one man, and the wounding of several others.The third serious occurrence in the country during the week took place at Llspole, 5 miles from Dingle, Co. Kerry, where a Distriot Inspector R.I.C., one Sergft. and 9 constables were attacked by a large number of rebels estimated at over 100-. After a long fight, the/rebels were driven off with casualties of about 8 killed and 20 wounded.In Dublin there have been a few instances of bomb attacks on troops in lorries without serious results.    The chief incident in the city itself has been the discovery of a large number of arms,ammunition and explosives in two different houses.    These seizures represent the largest capture of arms and explosives yet made in one &quot;olaoe, and it is thought that their collection together probably hud in view their use in some big contemplated outrage., possibly in connection with Mountjoy Prison.    The propaganda department of the rebels has been discovered in Dublin and raided by the Auxiliary Division R.I.O.    A very large amount of correspondence,&apos;files, and literature was seized.The destruction of roads continues, in, spite of the fact that civilians on the spot are employed to fill in the trenches thus dug.    It is not certain whether these, destructions ase carried out in order to limit the roads which ordinary uatroia
j?.iand oenvoys oan take, and thus facilitate ambushes, or whether it is a;comprehensive soheme to isolate aetaohments of troops. Many of the roads obstructed are by-roads which are uraoticable only for f:.rm  carts.    The work of repairing the roads is for the most part ioeing confined to keeping open essential ioonimuni cat ions.    No further information has yet been received as to rebel concentrations in Kerry, but the situation is Ming oarefully watched, and in order to reinforce the 6th Division I have ordered the transfer of one battalion, the 1st Cduee^s Royal Regt. from Londonderry to Kilwortfc.Outrages whioh have occurred on railways, are chiefly connected with the boycott of goods from Belfast.    This boycott is beooming more intense, and Belfast traders are beginning to Buffer considerable loss.The Baster holidays have passed quietly througheu-t the:. .. -oountry.The following Appendices,are attached ...   .    .Appondia&apos; I.
