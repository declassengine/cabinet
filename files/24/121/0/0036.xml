From Viceroy, foreign and Political Department, 3P.I0&apos; mil March 1921.(Received 16th, 11 a.in.)Priority A.360 S.   Afghanistan.   Following from Pobbs, 71 C, dated 14th March : &quot; My telegram of 13th March, 70 C. I suggest that, if possible, Afghan delega-tion be permitted to go to Paris and London from Berlin, provided that Turkish Treaty discussions are finished before departure from Berlin,.and that in the mean-time Kabul negotiations are progressing. My reasons are that Bolsheviks here have inoculated Afghans with the belief that France and Great Britain are in great distress, devoid of supplies, and on verge of revolution, and ocular demonstration to the contrary would be most valuable. Moreover, anti-British impressions created by residence at Moscow and Berlin would, it may be hoped, be effaced by visit to Paris and London, especially if Afghan delegates returned by sea via India, thus gaining an idea of British sea-power. Lastly, Afghan Government would be greatly pleased by concessions, and considerable resentment, still felt and expressed by Tarsi recently at our former refusal to allow Afghan delegation to London, would disappear, f uncler-stand that delegation contains presentable and intelligent young Afghans educated at Kabul Military School, ex-pupils of which have impressed us very favourably here.&quot;We agree; indeed we do not think that conclusion of Turkish Treaty discussions need be made sine qudnov.
