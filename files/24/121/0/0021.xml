The total of 56*3 million yon has a sterling equivalent at par&apos;of  5*64 million.

MESOPOTANIA.



Sheik Salim, the Sheik of Koweit has died of pneumonia.

It is reported that a number of Sheriffian officers have left Damascus for Mosul with a caravan of rifles and ammunition in order to stir up trouble in that area.



FINLAND.

The Finnich Government have telegraphed a protest to the Soviet Government against the air reconnaissance which has recently been carried out on the Finnish frontier.

Apprehension is felt that the Kronstadt garrison may evacuate into Finland over the ice.

The Government has resigned over the refusal of the Diet to sanction an increase of official salaries.



RUSSIA.



The insurgents at Kronstadt and on board the Battleshin "Petropavlovak" continue to hold out. The characteristic of this revolt is that the White organisation is repudiated by the insurgents, who state they are fighting against the oligarchy of Trotsky and the extremist section of the Communist party. No definite news has been received, but it appears evident that the revolt will be crushed although the reaction will be felt throughout Russia, and the existing Government&apos;s authority very much shaken. Trotsky has declared his intention of starving out the Kronstadt garrison. The fort has plenty of ammunition but only 14 days&apos; provisions. If Red Cross supplies are sent via Finland, the services of a powerful ice-breaker will be required. Captain Wolfe-Murray,R.N. British Naval Attache to Scandinavia, is now at Helsingfors, and has been instructed to remain there until situation clears.

Caspian Sea and Trans-Caspia.

Movements of Bolshevik troops from Krasnovodsk to Baku are reported, no doubt in connection with the Georgian offensive. Turcomans in Kizil-Arvat area are working in co-operation with Bolshevik raiding parties. In the Krasnovodsk area it is estimated that the Bolshevik forces consist of about 20,000 troops with artillery. Detailed dispositions have been received.

Siberia.

 Confirmatory reports of the expected Semenoff Spring rising have been received.

DENMARK.

Danish aerial traffic lines for Copenhagen - Hamburg - London are expected to commence shortly.



GERMANY.



All British troops have reached their destinations in Upper Silesia. The Plebiscite takes place on the 20th.
GREECE.

A railway strike, which threatens to become general, has broken out. The strikers&apos; demands are unacceptable to the Government, who threaten drastic measures, and have mobilised the maritime workmen, and have requisitioned fifteen ships for local communications.

The shipping strike at Piracus is ended.



GEORGIA.

The situation on the 10th March was as follows:- Turkish Nationalist Troops at the request of the Georgian Government were about to occupy the province East of Batoum and adjacent districts. The Turkish advance commenced on 10th March. Is is reported that the occupation will be military and temporary; the Georgian flag will continue to fly, and the civil administration will be retained. It is anticipated that the Georgian Army now on the Ingur line will retire to Somibrodi.



ARMENIA.

Relations between Armenia and Nationalist Turkey.

The Armenian Commissary for Foreign Affairs, Bezadian, states "My Government is observing with complete satisfaction the animated interest displayed by the Angora Government in the future of Soviet Armenia. From now on, Soviet Armenia may prove to be a reliable background for revolutionary Turkey in her struggle against Western imperialism. Soviet Armenia is a creation of Soviet Russia. It expresses the principles of the latter, and will be a watchful sentry of the revolution in the Near East.

The Armenian Government do not see any justification for the Turkish (Angora) Government retaining troops in Alexandropol, and hope they will withdraw them and release and repatriate Armenian prisoners of war."

(Note. Angora shows no sign of withdrawing these troops from Alexandropol.)

The Nationalist Turkish and Soviet Armenian delegations have left for the forthcoming conference at Moscow. An Azerbaijan delegation will also be present.



JUGO-SLAVIA.

According to press reports, the Italian - Jugo-slav Commission for the delimitation of the frontier between the two countries, on the basis of the Treaty of Rapallo, has agreed to deal with the territories of Dalmatia to be given to Jugo-Slavia in three groups.

The first group, which will include the islands, will be evacuated by the Italians in the first half of April. The evacuation of the second group will begin on April 20th, and the third on 1st May.

It is estimated that, by the end of May, the whole of Dalmatia, with the exception of Zara, will be under the rule of the S.H.S. Government.



ITALY.

The King of Italy is to vist Triesto on the occasion of the ceremonial annexation of the place of Italy. The date of the visit is provisionally fixed for the 20th March, but labour troubles may cause a postponement. One  of H.M. ships will be present, as a compliment to the King.

   
SPAIN.

The Prime Minister, Senor Dato, was assassinated on the evening of 8th March, while returning to his house from the Chamber. It is thought that the murder is the work of Syndicalists as an act of reprisal for the rigour being displayed against their outrages in Barcelona. The assassins made good their escape, but a number of arrests have been made.

Sonor Maura was asked to form a Cabinet, but was unable to do so owing to difficulties being placed in the way by some prominent conservatives. The King then asked Senor Allonds Salazar, who has succeeded in constituting a Cabinet representative of the various Conservative groups.

All parties consider that the death of Senor Dato has much increased the gravity of the political situation.



SOUTH AMERICA

It is reported that a permanent committee of representatives of Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela has been formed to work for the unity of the three republics under the name of Grand Colombia.
