Leave Copenhagen 21st March for visit to Libau.FINLAND.The Minister of Defence, is proposing the following new Naval programme, based on a grant of 300 million Finnish marks, (the original 600 million being, out of the question).8 monitors 800 - 1,000 tons,armed-with 9.4* guns, 15 knots. 4      D       500 tons, armed with 4.5&quot; guns(?),15 knots. 6 Torpedo boats, 700 tons, 32 knots. 4 Submarines (if possible to include 2 minelayers) 32 0.M.B!s, 25 tons. 1 Parent Ship for submarines.1 Training Ship, sail and auxiliary steam, 1,200 tons.Also a number of tugs, small auxiliary craft, motor boats, etcThis excoeds the limit laid down by the League of Nations and has not yet, apparently, been put &quot;before the Finnish Diet.

The first consignment has already arrived.It is reported that the German Admiral von ELntze arrived in Finland on 16 th Liar oh.   He is the candidate of the Pro-German Finnish party as instructor for the Finnish Navy.   Much intrigme is taking place in Finland by the pro-German party to enclude Dr. Holsti, who is very Anglophile, from any Government which may be formed.RUSSIA,Red Fleet.   Kronstadt fell on 17th March, partly due to treachery on the part of Communist elements amon$ the revolutionaries.   General Zozlovski, who has arrived in Finland, states that disaster was due to exhaustion of S.A.A. and to the fact that the last bread ration had been distrl-buted and only tinned meat and fish remained.   He states that the Dreadnought &quot;Sevastopol&quot; was blown up and sunk and that the &quot;petro pavlovsk&quot; was so badly damaged by explosive that she probably also sank.   Terijoki reports that big gun firing was still heard on the 18th and expresses belief that sailors were still resisting.   8,000 refugees including whole   revolutionary Committee have already arrived in Finland and 7,000 more are expected.The Soviet S.S. &quot;Subotnik&quot; arrived at Reval on 28thFebruary from Stettin.

Captain Audoin has been appointed in charge of this Mission.
PERSIA.The Persian Government intend to make an announcement cancelling the AngHo^Persian Agreement.   The Prime Minister explains that this step is necessary to remove misunderstandings which have arisen in the country but that it does not imply any lack of friendship to England and he emphasises the complete dependence of his Government on the support of H.M. Government.RUSSIA.Press reports regarding the general situation in Russia would appear to be much exaggerated.     The revolt at Kronstadt has been suppressed.      Moscow is again quiet, but there is still a food and fu&amp;l crisis.      The peasant rising is still serious but well informed opinion holds that the Soviet Government will be able to overcome their present difficulties. Press reports that the Extraordinary Commission in Moscow lias arrested Kameneff, O-in-0. of all armed forces of Soviet Republic and Lebedeff, his Chief of Staff.     The reason for their arrest is unknown.Black Soa.Refugees.

PALBST INg.Although Smir Abdullah disclaims any intention of interfering with the local Government in Trans-Jordania, it is probable that he will gradually assume their authority, which first his propaganda from Maan and now his presence at Amman have done much to undermine.
6J347LITHUANIA.The Government has accepted the League of Nations&apos; proposals regarding Vilna,   A statement is appended relative to the illegal presence of Zeligovski and troops at Filna, the control of victualling and a limitation of requisitioning. The text is well considered and moderate in tone.POLAND *The Polish - Bolshevik peace Treaty was signed at Riga on 18th March.GEORGIA.The Georgian Government have come to an agreement with the Soviet Government at Tiflis, by which the latter take over Batoum.     Soviet troops were expected at Batoun on 18th March.     The Georgian Government sailed on Friday, 18th March, with the Italian Minister, on hoard steamer &quot;Fra Joseph Kiraly11. German and Italian Missions are embarking on the same steamer and French and American Representatives in their respective war ships.      The Georgian troops were left to their &quot;fate.   Those turned Bolshevik and after several hours fighting, drove out Turkish troops.      Local revolutionary oommittees have taken over the town and about 1,500 Soviet troops of the 11th Red Army have also entered the town.     The Turkish troops out-side tho town may attack.The British Commissioner and Mission were on board H.M.S. &quot;Montrose&quot; and were expected to leave Batoum on 19t$ March, 1021.GERMANY.Bavaria.The Frame Minister stated in the Bavarian Parliament that he could not co-operate as regards either dissolving or disarming the Einwohnerwehr in the present circumstances, nor could he condemn those who refused to let themselves be deprived of their weapons.Upper Silesia.The German Foreign Office has given a categorical denial to the Polish assertion as to concentration of German troops on the frontier.ITALY.The visit of the King of Italy to Trieste on 20th March has been cancelled.The railway strike in. Greece ended on 14th March.According
DatoAccording to press reports, the 1913. 1914 and 1915 classes of reservists have been called to the Colours.The Greek Government declare that this measure is intended to reinforce Greek troops at the front, and that although Greece had no idea of provoking war, she would make every effort to carry through tho execution of the Treaty of Sevres,Greek Operations.The British Liaison Officer reported on 9th March that it was considered necessary to postpone operations owing to unfavourable weather conditions, the non-arrival of aeroplanes and heavy gun tractors, and the delay in effecting improvements toe ommunic ation s.On the other hand, in view of the fact that General Paponlas&apos; staff left for Smyrna on 14th March, the report from S.H.O., Smyrna, that Greek troops had been arriving by sea, from 14th to 16th Liar oh, and press new3 stating that the Greek. Government had called the 1913, 1914 and 1915 classes of reservists to the Colours, it appeared probable that an offensive was imminent,C-in-O., Mediterranean, reported on 20th March, however, that General Papoulas had received orders from Athens postponing the offensive.ARMENIA,.According to press reports, the Armenian revolutionaries are still holding their own, but Bolshevik reinforcements are pressing in the Delyan region, whilst another force, apparently consisting of the late Bolshevik garrison of Srivan, is fighting its way southwards, and has practically surrounded the Armenians.FRENCH MOROCCO,Minor operations continue to be carried out.     In the neighbourhood of Khenifra, 110 miles S.S.V,\ of Fez a detachment of regular troops, accompanied by irregulars, recently seized the rocky eminence of Achtir which dominates the French port of Ehorn, in the area of the Tadla-Saian tribe.     This important point, occupied without loss, commands a mountainous defile, which will be of great use for future operations of pacification in this area.Reports have been received from War.zan, 90 miles N.N.W. of Fez that tribesmen of the Beni-Mestaret attacked a French post at Issoual,     The French suffered 21 casualties, whilst the enemy suffered heavily.

Date- will be continued typthe present Government,Spanish Morocco.Spanish troops under General Sylvestre have occupied Canile and Tauzanan, two positions on the Lididriss Plain, in the neighbourhood cf Melilla, without opposition.CENTRAL AMERICA.Muoh interest has boon aroused in the United   States in connection with the appeal of Panama to the League of Mations to arbitrate in the territorial dispute between that country and Costa Rica, as an acceptance of this appeal will necessitate a definition by the United States of their attitude towards the League.It is generally considered that mediation by the League of Mations would not involve an infringement of the Monroe doctrine in as much as numerous previous disputes have been arbitrated by Muropean rulers.
