[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.SECRET.13090/S.Paraphrase of a Telegram from Mr. Churchill, Cairo,to the Prime Minister.(Received Colonial Office 1115 i\m., March 10, 1921.)Proceeding on assumptions contained in my telegram of the 14th March* addressed to you, I am now in a position to present definite proposals for action. These are concerned only with first stage of reduction in Mesopotamia. I have been strictly limited by the rate at which troops can be brought to port, the maximum quantity of shipping available, also length of time troops are retained pending demobilisation on our charge in India.All authorities, including Cox, Generals Haldane, Congreve, Ironside, Radcliffe, Colonel Lawrence and Major Young, have reached complete agreement on all points, both political and military. One-third approxi-mately of troops, for which provision was made in estimates of 1991-22, will leave country as fast as shipping becomes available. Proportionate reductions will be enforced of staffs, auxiliary services of all kinds, followers and animals. Mr. Crosland, financial representative of War Office, estimates resultant saving on estimate for Palestine and Mesopo-potamia in 1921-22 at 5,500,000^., provided prompt action is taken at all points. Further saving would result if India could be induced to shorten up time, during which troops remain on our charge after repatriation to India.I propose that garrison as thus reduced to 23-battalion scale shall remain during dangerous hot-weather period intact; but that if, firstly, country remains quiet internally, and is not disturbed from outside; that, secondly, Arab Government proves a success; and, thirdly, good progress be made in training of the local levies and development of Arab army, a further reduction to a 12-battalion scale with further resultant savings shall take place in October, but these are contingent upon course of events, jAll concerned have also reached provisional conclusions upon normal or permanent garrison for Mesopotamia, which it is hoped to reach some time i?i 1922-23.   I will not trouble you with details at this time of/ -* Copies of this telegram and of the Prime Ministers reply are printed in the Appendix. [5919] B
the respective parts to be played in this scheme by Imperial military forces, by air forces and by local forces. When I return all these will be explained by me, but principle has been accepted by all that cost of garrison in Mesopotamia in 1922-23-24 shall not exceed an average of 5,000,00QZ.-6,000,000Z. a year. Of course, fulfilment of this third stage depends upon successful political administration.Arrangements have been made in spite of above reductions to hold whole country, including Mosul and Kirkuk, without a hiatus until local levies are trained. Political conditions involve Peisal solution for Iraq with a separate Home Rule arranged under the High Commissioner for mandatory of Kurdistan.   I will explain this also on my return.Samuel arrives to-morrow, and shall endeavour to secure further reductions in Palestine, although the amounts which are involved cannot be large.I request approval in principle of these proposals so far as immediate reductions are concerned, and assistance of my colleagues in rendering them effective.I append (1) proposed procedure in regard to Emir Feisal and policy in Iraq and Kurdistan; (2) detailed telegram prepared for me by General Radcliffe on military aspect; and (3) financial forecast by Mr. Crosland.Policy with regard to Iraq.Consideration of reduction of Mesopotamian expenditure has been proceeded with in Conference on assumption that I may expect shortly a favourable reply to my telegram of 14th March. Objects which are to be aimed at can best be obtained by adopting following procedure. Sir Percy Cox to arrive in Basra early April and announce forthwith sentences of military courts and the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to grant general amnesty, with one or two exceptions, for persons interned or exiled in connection with 1920 disturbances. Feisal, as soon as possible, to proceed to Mecca and thence to telegraph on about 23rd April to his friends in Mesopotamia saying that British Government had informed him, in response to their enquiries, that they would place no obstacle in the way of his candidature as ruler of Iraq, and that he would have their support if he were chosen ; that he, after discussion with his father and brothers, had decided to offer services Iraq. We think that Feisal, in order to counter anti-mandate propaganda in Mesopotamia, should make it clear that he was prepared to accept terms of mandate as laid before the League of Nations, but we are not of opinion that he can do so unless I am authorised to guarantee that by so doing possibility of subsequent readjustment of relations between mandatory and properly constituted Government of Mesopotamia will not be precluded.   Such readjustment
to take form of modification of the mandate into a treaty providing for continuance of the support of the mandatory subject to adequate safe-guarding and maintenance of latter&apos;s special interests and privileged position in Iraq. In addition, he would telegraph Nagib and Say id Talib, as representing Provisional Government, saying he hoped to have their support and personal co-operation in the future, At the same time Abdullah would communicate with those friends who formerly supported his candidature, saying that he had withdrawn in favour of Feisal. Having seen from his friends primary effect of this, Feisal would either send representative or himself come to Mesopotamia during Ramaxan. It is anticipated that FeisaFs announce-ment, followed by arrival in country, would result in such a definite expression of public feeling on his behalf as would render unnecessary for us to ask the Congress to discuss question of ruler, and they would simply directly or indirectly confirm his nomination. This having been done, Feisal would dissolve present Provisional Government, namely, the Council of Ministers, and call Nagib or someone else to form Cabinet. The foregoing recommendations have unanimously been adopted, and I urgently request you to obtain Cabinet sanction for them in time to allow me to concert final details with Cox before he leaves Cairo.Policy in Kurdistan.Having regard to article (32 of Treaty of Sevres, Southern Kurdistan has not hitherto been brought under Provisional Government of Meso-potamia, and High Commissioner had intimated that he proposed to deal direct with local officials in Kurdish areas until expiration of year allowed by article 5. Acting on assumption article 62 is no longer operative, and that accordingly there is no question of Southern Kurdistan at any future date opting for union with Northern Kurdistan, the Conference has considered what line of policy with regard to purely Kurdish districts should be pursued. Our conclusion was that if at this stage any attempt was made to force them under rule of the Arab Government they would undoubtedly resist, and a complication would thus be added to our withdrawal. We recommend, therefore, that they, together with the Iraq Government, should be informed that our intention under mandate is to maintain existing arrangement until such time as a representative body of Kurdish States may opt for inclusion in Iraq. The advantage of this solution will be to enable us to recruit Kurdish units under British officers, and thus to accelerate reduction of Imperial forces in certain areas. This policy will also tend to discount the endeavours of Turks to seduce Kurds in our territory.[5919]
Iraq.  Military.1. The Conference recommends, after full consideration by military and civil authorities, and agreement of all concerned, that the following further reductions in Mesopotamia garrison should be made as soon as reduction to a total of 33 battalions and G cavalry regiments, &amp;c, already in progress, has been reached: 2 British battalions, 1 British cavalry regiment, 8 Indian battalions, 3 Indian cavalry regiments, 2 sappers and miners companies, 5 field batteries, 4 pack batteries.2. It will be apparent from this that, of 14 that were due for relief by fresh units, 8 Indian battalions can be returned now to India without relief, and orders should be issued at once stopping the despatch to Mesopotamia of corresponding relieving units from either India or Egypt, as may seem best. As the General Officer Commanding considers that there are only 8 battalions whose immediate relief is imperative, arrange-ments should be made, unless it is already too late, to stop despatch of further 3 relieving battalions. It is considered that, in view of further reductions contemplated in the autumn, remaining 3 battalions should stay for few months required, but should be made up to strength, and such of their personnel as can be demobilised should be repatriated.3. I understand, in this connection, that we are threatened with charge of sum of 2,500,000Z. in 1921-22 for Indian units maintained in India to provide reliefs for units in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. The above-mentioned large reductions and further reductions which I contemplate later in year compel me to ask War Office to arrange with India to get rid of the whole, or almost the whole, of this charge without delay.4. Reduction to 33-battalion level is not at the present moment proceeding as quickly as it might, the reason being the lack of sufficient shipping at Basrah, which at present is only sufficient to evacuate about 3,000 men per week whereas, if sufficient shipping were provided, 5,000 per week could be evacuated; and it is hoped to be able to increase this rate to 6,000 per week. It is of the utmost urgency therefore, in order that maximum financial saving in 1921-22 may be effected immediately, to increase shipping at Basrah to capacity of 6,000 per week.It is estimated that if additional shipping can be counted on at Basrah from 1st May, all combatants to be reduced on new decisions will have been evacuated by the end of June, by which date the garrison will be down to 23-battalion level, except as regards auxiliary services, which in turn will then be speedily reduced pro rata. In addition, General Haldane is confident that he can further reduce substantially the local transport, Indian labour and followers.5. You will doubtless settle in consultation with India the order of priority in which units are to be repatriated, having regard to length of service ex India and other considerations.6. Consequent upon the reduction of garrison, it is estimated that there will be some 25,000 surplus horses and mules in Mesopotamia.
India declines to take any of these. It is proposed that as many as possible should be sold locally if the Remount Department does not need them elsewhere, and that the remainder should be destroyed immediately in order to avoid needless drain in new financial year. Please telegraph fully and very urgently on this point.7. On all above measures, together, I am advised by Mr. Crosland we may expect following savings in 1921-22 provided immediate energetic action is taken : Reduction of troops after allowing for sea transport charges, 1,200,0002. ; relief units in India, 1,500,000?.; local transport, Indian labour and followers, 2,000,000Z.; horses, forage, 800,000Z. Total 5,500,0002., of which roughly 500,0002. would be transferred to other votes from Mesopotamian vote.Chuhchill.
APPENDIX.Telegram from Mr. Churchill to the Prime Minister,(Received Colonial Office, 8-80 p.m., March 14, 1921.)(Personal and Secret.)Prospects Mesopotamia promising, but then&apos; are three points on which .1 require your help.First. I think we shall require unanimous conclusions among all authorities that Feisal offers hope of best and cheapest solution.If so, can go ahead on this line? Formula would be : &quot; In response to enquiries from adherents of Emir Feisal the British Government have stated that they will place no obstacles in the way of his candidature as Puller of Iraq, and that if he is chosen lie will have their support.&quot; Do you think you and Lord Curzon have said enough to the French to justify my proceeding on this basis? If so, all the better because we do not want any premature disclosure and agitation to be made by them.If however you feel that further reference to the French is necessary, surely now while you are helping them in Germany would be the best moment lor settling with them; and in this case they should be asked to treat this communication as confidential for the present. On the receipt of your assent to this formula I shall tell Lawrence he can communicate formula to Feisal. On this Feisal will at once proceed to Mecca, passing through Egypt on the way. We do not want any announcement, even in guarded terms, of formula if it can be possibly avoided until Feisal is at Mecca and Sir P. Cox at Baghdad about the middle of April. Method of choice will require careful study in order to avoid confused or meaningless expression of Mesopotamian opinion. Time is short as Sir P. Cox must return, and all my plans depend on clear settlement with him before we separate. I have no doubt personally Feisal offers far away best chance of saving our money. Please therefore endeavour to telegraph to me as soon as you possibly can that I am free to make plans on basis of formula.Secondly. I have not received any official account of your Turkish negotiations, but Reuter&apos;s summaries indicate that probable settlement has caused general satisfaction and relief to all concerned with Mesopotamia. Can I now assume and so inform military that we need not prepare against Turkish inroad or intrigue in Mosul this year? Have you been able to stipulate for this with Turks. If I take this as a basis it will greatly simplify my task of reducing garrison quickly without giving up Mosul. On the other hand if assumption is subsequently falsified all my dates of reduction will he upset. Please, therefore, if possible, telegraph to me that I can count upon immunity from Turkish interference in near future.Thirdly. [? Groups missing.] Incredible waste now proceeding in Mesopotamia can only be cured by driving large numbers of troops and followers out of country and off our pay list. On this, I propose, provided my general plan is accepted, to take immediate and drastic action, thus securing large saving in 1921-22. I am met by assertion that many thousands of men and followers could not begin to leave country if shipping were available. Already it is declared that troops are being delayed at Basrah through lack of shipping, and certainly time table reduction of garrison to pre-rebellion figures by the 31st March on which we were counting is already fortnight in iirrears. We have to carry everybody back sooner or later, and keeping them waiting eating up our mutton is pure waste. Will you, therefore, kindly tell Shipping Controller or send him personal message that he is to meet my requirements and carry troops and followers away from Basrah as fast as I can bring them to port.   Exact figures will be furnished in a few
days, but considerable additional shipping will be required in the Persian Gulf as soon as possible and extra charge will be nothing compared to saving through earlier demobilisation.I am provisionally telling military that they may assume that we will carry away promptly whatever troops they bring to Basrah, and that they have done their part when they have brought them to port. Please confirm this. I should also be obliged if you would impress on India Office that we cannot agree to be charged for these men for several months after they return to India.To sum up. If in three or four days you can give me favourable answers on these three points I shall hope to send you definite and detailed programme of action.I propose leaving here Hist March, arriving London about 7th April.Telegram fkom Prime Minister to Mr. Churchill.(Secret and Personal.&quot;) March 16, 1021.l.\ reply to personal and secret telegram received Colonial Office 14th March.Reply to three points in your telegram is as follows:  First. We have repeatedly hinted to the French that if there is a strong demand for Feisal from Mesopotamia, and peace can be restored by establishing him as Ruler in Iraq, we should not feel justified in vetoing his candidature. Unless initiative comes from Mesopotamia, however, our position with the French will he embarrassing, and we think it will be very difficult to reconcile procedure you propose with the attitude we have adopted with the French Foreign Office in this matter. We think it essential, therefore, that real initiative in any demand for Feisal should come from Mesopotamia. Sir Percy Cox and Miss Gertrude Bell will no doubt advise you as to whether this initiative will be forthcoming. You will doubtless recall, however, that Feisal when sounded in London as to his personal attitude made it perfectly clear that he woull not become a candidate for Iraq until Abdullah&apos;s claims had been disposed of.Second point. We have entered into no stipulation with the Turks which excludes the possibility of a Turkish inroad or intrigue in Mosul this year. Turkish Delegation in London has recognised that we have offered very considerable concessions, but have protested against our proposals in regard to Smyrna, and against absence of any concession in Eastern Thrace. We have no certainty that settlement will be accepted by Turks. Turks are reported to be concentrating troops on Greek front, and Greeks may feel compelled to attack them. We are quite unable to control either side, and no truce has been arranged. Should fighting occur it is difficult to judge what its reaction will be on Mesopotamian front. We are, however, warning Turks that if any hostile action is taken in Mesopotamia we shall consider ourselves at liberty to arm the Greeks.Third point. I am in full sympathy with your desire to cure the waste and reduce troops in Mesopotamia. I have asked the Secretary of State for War and Shipping Controller to take up the matter at once.
