JThis Document [3 tne Property of His Sntannic Majes.y&apos;s Government.secret submit the following for the decision of the Cabinet 6I.M.12th March, 1921.The Inter-Allied Conference on the cere of Disabled Men.On 1st March, 1920, the Committee of Home Affairs had before it a Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions CttPo-708; explaining the origin and development of the permanent Inter-Allied Committee on the after care of disabled men,&apos; and it was decided &quot;That the Eritish Delegation should propose that the functions of the inter-Allied Committee on the care of disabled men be transferred to the Health and Labour Sections of the League of Nations and, therefore, that it would be inappropriate to invite representatives of Discharged Soldiers1 and Sailors&apos; Associations to accompany the British Delegation&quot;.The British Delegation to the meeting of the Permanent Inter-Allied Committee held in Paris on the 28th June last, duly submitted this proposal.   In support of it they pointed out that, as a result of the medical and surgical treatment necessitated by the disabilities sustained in the Great Y/ar, medical science had made marked developments, and that these developments should, in the interests of public health, be placed at the service of the community at large, and should not be confined to the discussions of a special Committee concerned solely with the men disabled in the war P   Fur the R.T. they urged that in the matter ofthe
the employment of disabled men, the special measures which mirrht be taken for this purpose, not only affected Labour at large, but would be of direct value in the consideration of the problem of the re-employment of men disabled in general industry.The Inter-Allied Committee did not regard the proposal favourably, and adjourned the matter for further consideration  by   the Inter-Allied Conference and Exhibition which was held in Brussels in September last.   As a result of further consideration, a lengthy reply to the proposals made at the Paris Conference has been furnished deprecating the suggestion, the tenor of ^hich is briefly to the effect that the problems raised by war disablement are sui generis and should, be reserved to a special body like the Inter-Allied Committee, which should be permanent.On full consideration, however, I am satisfied that the decision of the Home Affairs Committee of March last   should be maintained and acted upon.   The Inter-Allied Committee was, from its inception, in the nature of an informal gathering of persons representing the Allied countries, for the consideration of certain common problems arising out of the war; the members of it cannot, in most cases, be considered to carry the weight of official representatives of their respective Governments, nor can the decisions of the Committee be regarded as binding on their Governments.   Many of the proposals made at recentmeetings
meetings   (for example, for the formal appointment of representatives of Ar.soelotions of disabled men; for the maintenance of a permanent institute in Central Europe; for the study of problems arising out of the rar as effecting disabled men, and the foundation of scholarships for the maintenance of disabled men as students of this institute, and the like) are those of an irresponsible body --ith which I see no advantage and some Inconvenience in representatives of my Department being associated.The participation of British representatives in tho Inter-Allied Committee and Conference involves y. standing expenditure of  1,500 a year, which is devoted to the maintenance of a permanent office in Paris, the French and American Governments contributing like sums, apart from the personal expenses of delegates and exhibits; and this expenditure, I understand, it is proposed to increase.The Health and Labour Sections of the League of Nations having now been formally constituted, I should propose to Intimate to the Governments concerned the withdrawal of the British representatives from further association with the Permanent Committee and Conference.   The Ministers of Health and of Labour have a creed to this course, on the understanding that the Health and Labour Sections of the League of Nations will seriously undertake the duties which the Committee was formed to discharge.It is manifest that Allied Governments have taken little interest of late In the committee, and I should not anticipate, therefore, thatobjections
objections of a diplomatic character to the action I propose that the Government should take, will arise.I recommend, therefore -(a) that the French and American Governments should be informed that the British Government sees no reason to continue to send representatives to the Inter-Allied Committee and Conference;and(b) that the necessary steps bo taken in conjunction with the Foreign Office, to call the attention of the League of Nations to the action taken and to intimate the willingness of the British Government to supply the Health and Labour Sections of the League with all necessary information to enable them to dischargo the duties of the Inter-Allied Committee.IAN MAGPHEKSON,Ministry of Pensions. 12th March, 1921.
