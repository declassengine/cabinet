THIS IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITASUIC l^JEST^S (K^TOS^ISECRET. C. P. 2755*PSOPOTAHU, pDecypher of telegram from iir, Churchill, Cairo, Received at the Colonial Office March 21st.Dated March 21st.Secret.   Following for Prime Minister and circulation to the Cabinet.Part one, I hope the decision which the Cabinet will take to-morrow w,&apos;Jl be in the sense of (one group undec:) reasonable latitude in handling of Henopotamian candidature.   I do not underrate in any way difficulties (one group undec:) delicacy of problem.   There will certainly be local opposition to any Sheri-fian candidate owing to vigorous pressing of personal claims by rivals on the bpot.

In all the Arab world there is no other competing principle capable of maintain-Iing an Arab state ou modern lines than the Sherifian. On the other hand I am deeply conscious of danger that by a too (one group undec;7 open advocacy of Feieal we might defeat our ownends.   This must he handled by Sir Percy Cox on the spot (two groups undec:)   he gets back the better as much intrigue is rife,in his absence, and we wish to have liberty to do our best in un-ostentatious ways, having regard to all foregoing conditions, to secure adoption of Feisal.   Of course the more spontaneous de-mand for him the better (three groups undec:) there will be. Bear in mind also that Feisal muse be given somfc assurance that we wish him well and that he has a good chance before he will ex-pose himself to the labours and embarrassments of candidature.ITow as to the French: if Feisal is chosen they will cer-tainly believe, whatever we say, that we have so willed and theyIwill be quite right.   You alone can judge whether any further communication to them is necessary.   There are many advantages in making none until Sir P.Cox is hack in Mesopotamia,
