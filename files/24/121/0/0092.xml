THE Reparation Commission has the honour to enclose herewith, for the information of the Government of Great Britain, a copy of the correspondence exchanged since the 26th February last with the Kriegslastenkommission with regard to the payment of the balance of the 20 milliards of gold marks due from Germany under Article 235.of the Treaty of Versailles.It will be seen from this correspondence that the Reparation Commission has come to the conclusion that the German Government has definitely failed to comply with a demand duly made by the Commission in accordance with the Treaty.Tn these circumstances, the Commission has the honour, in accordance with paragraph 17 of Annex 2 of Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles, to give formal notice of Germany&apos;s default in the performance of her obligations.(Signed)        DUBOIS.JOHN BRADBURY.(Six enclosures.)No. 4.No. 13/184.From: The Reparation Commission.

No. 283/21. Report No. 150.British Delegation, Reparation Commission, May it please your Lordships, &quot; Astoria&quot; Paris, March 26, 1921.IN continuation of my Report No. 14-1 of the 15th instant, on the subject of&quot; the obligations of the German Government under Article 235 of the Treaty of Versailles, I have the honour to transmit herewith for your Lordship&apos;s information a letter dated the 24th instant from the Reparation Commission giving formal notice to His Majesty&apos;s Government, in accordance with paragraph 17 of Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Treaty, of Germany&apos;s default in the performance of her obligations under the above Article.Copies of the correspondence referred to in the letter from the Reparation Commission are enclosed for your Lordship&apos;s information.Copies of this Report and of the relative correspondence have been communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Paris.I have, &amp;c.JOHN BRADBURY.The Lords Commissioners, His Majesty&apos;s Treasury,Whitehall, London, S.W.
No. 5.No. 13/96.From: The Reparation Commission. To: The Kriegslastenkommission.(Arrived March 10, 1921.)Reparation Commission Registry, March 10, 1921. WITH reference to letter No. C.R.13/96 of the 26th February, 1921, on the subject of payments under Article 235, the Commission request that a reply may be made by the German Government which will, reach the Commission on or before Monday, the 14th March.(Signed)       DUBOIS.JOHN BRADBURY.[6030] B 2before that date. In view, however, of the liability of Germany under Article 235 of the Treaty to pay 20 milliard of gold marks, under the conditions specified in that Article, before the 1st May, 1921, the Commission considers it desirable to make this communication.The Commission is advised that as the object of the payment of 20 milliards under Article 235 is to enable the Allied and Associated Powers to proceed at once to the restoration of their industrial and economic life, only such deliveries as are capable of being put into liquid form and therefore useful for the above purpose can be admitted as a credit to Germany under this Article.While, therefore, the Commission makes every reserve on the admissibility and amount of the items included in the German note, but not mentioned below (1, 2, 3) it has come to the conclusion that the following items can in no case be admitted as credits to Germany, against the 20 milliards mentioned in Article 235, since they do not represent assets which are either liquid or capable of being made liquid in the near future.Items, Amount of German Valuation.Gold Marks.1. Capital value of the Saar mines   ...        ...     1,056,947,0002. Value of property in ceded territories ... 4,481,552,938 3. Value of five surrendered.railway bridges   ... 8,582,350The proportion (under (2) above) of the value of property in ceded territories which could be realised in liquid form before the 1st May, 1921 e.g.. in the case of Denmark is insignificant.Further, it is observed that two items Group A. No. VI, Merchant Marine, and Group E. No. V, abandoned property-together amount to nearly 10 milliard gold marks. On the information at present in the possession of the Commission, the sums properly to be credited under these heads together do not appear to amount to more than 1 milliard.But even if double this value were assigned to these two items, and if the German figures were admitted in full for the other items, and if credit were allowed for the full amounts expended by Germany on the Armies of Occupation and on food even without prior authorisation, there would remain a balance of over 12 milliards still unpaid in respect of the 20 milliards mentioned in Article 235.The Commission desire, therefore to make it clear to the German Government that the final account under Article 235 could not, in present conditions, fail to reveal a deficit of at least 12 milliards. Before communicating their decision under that Article they request the German Government to transmit any observations as to the manner in which the German obligation will be discharged.The Commission desire to add Coat they are proceeding with the detailed consideration of prices and values for the purpose of the general reparation account, and that it must be understood that this communication relates solely to the discharge of the German obligations under Article 235.(Signed)        DUBOIS.JOHN BRADBURY.
No. 6.No. 13/184. (No. W. 1187.)From: German Kriegslastenkommission. To: The Reparation Commission.(Received March 15, 1921.)Reparation Commission, Paris, March 14, 1921.IN reply to a Note from the Reparation Commission No. 13/184 of the 26th instant, I have the honour to make the following communication in the name of the German Government.The opinion of the Reparation Commission that the value of the Saar Basin, of Imperial and State property in territory ceded by Germany, and of five railway bridges ceded by Germany, cannot be credited against Germany&apos;s obligations under Article 235, is in no way supported by the above-mentioned Article of the Peace Treaty.Article 235 does not deline with precise limitations the different ways in which the payment of 20 milliards is to be made. Indeed, the Article admits all kinds of other possibilities of payments besides those laid down, as may be seen from the words &quot; ou autrenient &quot; in the French text and &quot; or otherwise &quot; in the English text. Moreover, the general sense of Article 235 cannot be recognised as meaning that the above-mentioned items are not suitable as credits against the first 20 milliards, for there can be no doubt that it has been possible for the Reparation Commission to mobilise the value of the ceded territory and to use it for the purposes of Article 235, the Imperial and State property in/eded territory and the Saar Basin having been for a long time in the possession of the iUlied Powers. The fact that it has not yet been possible for the Reparation Commission to assign the value of these objects cannot prevail against this opinion, for, in any case, it has been possible for the Reparation Commission to make approximate valuations. Further, the German Government desires to emphasise that it can in no way agree with the opinion of the Reparation Commission that the value of the ceded merchant shipping and abandoned material of non-military character does not amount to more than 1 milliard. On the contrary, the German Government is obliged to maintain the account which it has set up, especially because in the statement of deliveries made and services rendered which has been submitted, only a part of the entire abandoned material of non-military character has been brought to account.The German Government is therefore still of opinion that it has fulfilled the obligations incumbent upon it under Article 235. If, however, the Reparation Commission should reach a decision that the final account under Article 235 shows a debit for Germany, then the German Government sees no possibility of covering this debit before the 1st May, 1921, except by proceeding with further deliveries in kind to the Allied countries, such as are already being made. In so far as such deliveries will not suffice to amortise the bonds issued under paragraph (1) of paragraph 12 of Annex 2 of Part VIII of the Treaty of Peace, the bonds which have not been amortised will have to be exchanged for bonds provided under paragraph 2 of tlie same Annex.(Signed)        von OERTZEN.No. 7.No. B.R. 283/21. No. 13/184.From:-The Reparation Commission. To: The Kriegslastenkommission.(Despatched March 15, 1921.)Reparation Commission Registry, March 15, 1921. ARTICLE 235 of the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on the 28th June, 1919, and which came into force on the 10th January, 1920, stipulates that &quot; in order to enable the Allied and Associated Powers to proceed at once to the restora-tion of their industrial and economic life, pending the full determination of their claims, Germany shall pay in such instalments and in such manner (whether in gold, commodities, ships, securities or otherwise) as the Reparation Commission may fix, during 1919,1920, and the first four months of 1921, the equivalent of 20,000,000,000
gold marks.&quot; These 20,000,000,000 gold marks are to be used first to pay the cost of the armies of occupation and to supply Germany with foodstuffs and raw materials, and the balance is to be applied to reparation.On the 4th March, 1920, we had the honour to remind you of your obligations, especially in relation to the methods to be adopted for the payment of foodstuffs and raw materials to be supplied to Germany under the terms of Article 235.At the same time, the Commission requested the German Government, &quot; in order to allow of the execution of the provisions of this Article, including the last-named payment,&quot; to use &quot; all the securities (except those covered by Articles of the Treaty other than Article 235) which are in the possession of the German Government, of German States and of German nationals, and which represent interests in under-takings situated in neutral countries.&quot;On June 15, 1920, in a letter from the Finance Service, the Commission asked, &quot; what assets the German Government could offer in payment of the 20.000,000,000 gold marks mentioned in Article 235 of the Treaty of Versailles.&apos;&apos;On the 23rd June, 1920, the Kriegslastenkommission replied to this letter and to that of the 4th March as follows : &quot; The German Government will communicate to the Reparation Commission the request to deduct from the first 20,000,000,000 gold marks, in accordance with Article 235, all the deliveries in kind and otherwise effected by Germany up to this date, or to be effected before the 1st May, 1921, and which are to be credited to Germany&apos;s Reparation Account.&quot;It is true that on the 20th January, 1921, the Commission received a &quot; German Memorandum,&quot; giving &quot; a statement of the deliveries in kind and otherwise effected by Germany up to this date under the terms of the Peace Treaty and preliminary conventions, whose value was to be credited to her Reparation Account.&quot;Without wishing at that time to open a discussion on the Memorandum, we informed you in our letter of the 26th February, 1921, that the.sums with which we could then credit your account under the terms of Article 235 amounted to barely 8,000,000,000 gold&apos; marks, leaving a balance of at least 12,000,000,000 to be paid by the end of April.In the same letter we informed you that the Commission would be glad to receive your remarks on the procedure by which the German Government would meet its obligations.We were, moreover, certain that the German Government had long since considered the measures that it would adopt to fulfil these obligations.The reply of the German Government to our letter of the 26th February did not reach us until yesterday, the 14th March, and this only after an urgent reminder.In this reply, which gives to Article 235 and paragraph 12, Annex 2, Part VI LI of the Treaty of Versailles an interpretation upon which the Reparation Commission makes all reservations, the German Government states that it considers &quot; that it has fulfilled its obligations under the terms of Article 235.&quot;This constitutes a refusal.Under these conditions we must recall to you most formally the obligation on Germany&apos;s part to pay; before the 1st May, 1921, the balance of the 20 milliard gold marks referred to in Article 235, that is at least 12 milliard either in gold or in foreign currencies according to the rate of exchange of the dollar on the day of settlement.Before the 23rd March, 1921, at the latest without fail, the German Government must pay a first instalment of 1 milliard gold marks, to be deducted from the 12 milliard still due.This payment shall be effected :In &quot;French francs, to be paid to the account of the Commission at the Banque deFrance;In pounds sterling, to be paid to the account of the Commission at the Bank ofEngland; or:In dollars, to be paid to the account of the Commission at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The payment may be divided among these various Currencies as the German Government sees fit./The rate of exchange will be calculated on the day of payment according to the rate of the dollar at New York.
Before determining the dates and methods of the payment of subsequent instal-ments by which Germany is to fulfil the rest of her obligations, the Commission will be willing to consider any proposals that the German Government may submit before the 1st April, 1921, at trie latest, in regard to the partial substitution of the delivery of commodities or the transfer of foreign or German personal securities for the payments in gold or foreign currencies,In order to pay the remainder of the debt due under the terms of Article 235, the German Government might also, within the same period, submit to the Repara-tion Commission proposals for a foreign loan, the proceeds of which would be paid to the Commission.(Signed)        DUBOIS.JOHN BRADBURY.No. 8.,no. W. 2124From /-German Kriegslastenkommission. To: The Reparation Commission, Paris.Paris, March 22, 1921. 1 AM instructed by the German Government to make the following statement to the Reparation Commission : In note No. 13/184 of the 15th March, the Reparation Commission required the German Government, in execution of Article 235 of the Peace Treaty, to pay before the 1st May, 1921, in gold or in foreign currency, a sum of 12 milliard gold marks which the Reparation Commission considers still to be due, after taking into account the German deliveries and payments in kind made hitherto, and to pay an instal-ment of 1 milliard gold marks before the 23rd March. The Reparation Commission states that up to the present Germany has paid at most 8 milliard gold marks in execution of Article 235 of the Peace Treaty.In its note of the 14th March the German Government explained that it cannot admit the accuracy of this valuation, and it must protest against the fact that in the note of the 15th March its argument was treated as a purely formal objection. It refers once more to the Memorandum submitted to the Reparation Commission on the 20th January, in which it believes that it proved in detail that the securities delivered and the payments in kind made under the terms of Article 235 amount to 20 milliard gold marks; it refers also to the supplementary documents submitted to the Services of the Commission. The German Government is ready to produce further arguments, either in writing or verbally, in support of the statements contained in the Memorandum. It is true that discussions have been held between the Reparation Commission and the Kriegslastenkommission concerning certain deliveries made by Germany under Article 235, but the German Government has not yet had an opportunity to be heard on the total amount of these deliveries. According to paragraphs 9 and 10, Annex 2, Part VIII of the Peace Treaty, the German Government considers itself all the more entitled to a hearing, inasmuch as the Reparation Commission has recently declared its intention of excluding part of the deliveries already made from the sum to be credited toward the first 20 milliard stipulated in Article 235.The German Government cannot therefore recognise its obligation to pay a balance of 12 milliard gold marks until an examination has proved whether, and to what extent, it still has obligations to fulfil under Article 235. In its note of the 15th March the Reparation Commission refers to the correspondence exchanged with the Kriegslastenkommission on this subject, stating that in this correspondence it had at various times recalled the necessity of carrying out the terms of Article 235. The German Government, on the other hand, calls attention to the fact that in its note of the 23rd June, 1920, cited by the Reparation Commission, it pointed out the impossibility of paying such a large sum in cash, and explained that the few avail-able cash funds in the form of foreign securities would have to be utilised for the purchase of food and raw materials abroad.In the last eight months the Reparation Commission has not questioned these explanations, which were, moreover, repeated during the negotiations held between the Kriegslastenkommission and the Reparation Commission as a result of this note. The explanations prove that it is impossible to fulfil the terms of Article 235 by means of cash payments.
No. 9.No. 13/184.From: The Reparation Commission.To: The Chairman of the Kriegslastenkommission.(Despatched March 24, 1921.)Translation (original in French). March 24,1921.We have received your letter of the 22nd March, 1921, in reply to our letter of the 15th instant.In reply to this letter the Reparation Commission has the honour to observe : 1. That under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles the Reparation Commission is alone competent to value the deliveries and payments made by Germany.2. That the Reparation Commission, by the same Treaty, has authority to determine which of the deliveries hitherto made can be credited towards the 20 milliard gold marks due under Article 235.In view of the attitude adopted by the Reparation Commission up to the present, the German Government has been led&apos;to assume that its point of view concerning the impossibility of payments in cash was shared by the Reparation Commission. The last notes of the Reparation Commission, however, set forth an absolutely different point of view. The note of the 15th March demands the payment of 12 milliard gold marks within a period of approximately six weeks, of which 1 milliard is to be paid on account within one week only. Apart from the fact that the realisation of such large sums by a country exhausted by the war constitutes an almost insolvable problem, it is absolutely impossible for Germany to procure the necessary funds within the extremely short time limits announced.Even assuming that part of these funds could be obtained by a foreign loan, the most rudimentary technical considerations show that it is impossible, within the periods fixed, even to prepare such a loan, much less to open the subscription or to pay to the Reparation Commission the proceeds of such a loan. In view7, however, of the further weakening of the German economic situation as a result of the measures adopted by the Allies at the London Conference, the possibility of recourse to a foreign loan, even for part of the sums demanded, seems very remote. According to the provisions of the Peace Treaty the Reparation Commission must take into account the economic capacity of Germany when determining the indemnity to be imposed.Moreover, the German Government again calls attention to the fact that Germany will have to make good any possible deficit on the 1st May, 1921, by the exchange of-the bonds specified in sub-paragraph 1, paragraph 12 (6&apos;), Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Peace Treaty, against Treasury bonds bearing interest and similar to those referred to in sub-paragraph 2, paragraph 12 (c), Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Peace Treaty. These provisions of the Treaty should be all the more applicable since in the present case the impossibility of making the required payment by the 1st May, 1921, is very obvious.The German Government, therefore, asks that a possible deficit, to be deter-mined by a thorough examination of the payments and deliveries in kind already effected, be considered in conformity with the above provisions.In order to determine the question of the execution of the obligations prescribed by Article 235 promptly and definitively, the German Government proposes an immediate hearing of the Kriegslastenkommission by the Reparation Commission in regard to the valuation of the payments and deliveries in kind made up to the present, pursuant to the Memorandum submitted by the German Government. The German Government is willing at once to send competent representatives or experts to Paris to deal with this question.If it were found that the terms of Article 235 had not been carried out m full, the German Government would also be willing to enter into negotiations in regard to the issue of a foreign loan. It is, however, of opinion that such a loan could not be discussed solely in connection with the execution of Article 235, but merely in connection with the entire question of reparation.(Signed)        von OERTZEN.
3. That neither paragraph 9 nor paragraph 10 of Annex 2 to Part VIII with respect to any hearing of the representatives of the German Government as to Germany&apos;s capacity to pay and as to claims for damages imposed on the Reparation Commission an obligation to hear the German Govern-ment as to the conditions in which any given deliveries may, be credited towards the 20 milliards due under Article 235 or as to their valuation.In older not to hinder the economic revival of Germany, the Reparation Commission has postponed action as long as possible in the conviction that, after the exchange of correspondence which had taken place, the German Government would have taken the necessary steps to discharge faithfully the obligations imposed by Article 235. It was not until the Reparation Commission realised that the German Government had no such intention that it had recourse to the formal stipulations of the Treaty and claimed from Germany the payment, before the 1st May, 1921, of the 12 milliard gold marks still due, 1 milliard to be paid by the-23rd instant.In making its demand for the payment of 1 milliard gold marks by the 23rd March, the Commission was satisfied that Germany was in possession of sufficient assets to make such payment. As regards the further payments, the Commission, anxious that the spirit of fairness in which it desires to administer the Treaty should be beyond question, was careful to add that it was willing to consider any proposals which were submitted to it before the 1st April, 1921, in regard to the partial substitution for payment in gold or foreign currency of the delivery of commodities, the transfer of securities, or the proceeds of the issue of a foreign loan.The Reparation Commission therefore finds that the German Government, while refusing to comply with the demand duly made in accordance with the Treaty, puts forward an interpretation of Article 235 and of paragraph 12 (c) of Annex 2 which is clearly incorrect.The argument of the German Government cannot be sustained that if a deficit is shown on the 1st May, 1921, the only result should be the replacement of the bonds prescribed in paragraph 12 (c) 1 of Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles by interest-bearing bonds similar to those mentioned in paragraph 12 (c) 2 of thesame Annex.The 20 milliard gold marks due under Article 235 must not in any way be confused with the 20 milliard gold marks which represent the total of the first instalment of bonds prescribed by paragraph 12 (c) 1 of Annex 2.The 20 milliards of bonds under Annex 2 are a mere acknowledgment of indebtedness, which are only reckoned for the general reparation account.The 20 milliard gold marks under Article 235 are to be paid in liquid money or its equivalents, and are to be devoted partly and in the first instance to the expenses of the Armies of Occupation and authorised&quot; expenditure for the supply of foodstuffs and raw materials to Germany, partly and up to the limits of the balance for reparation. It is only that portion which can be placed to the reparation account which can go towards the partial redemption of the instalment of bonds for 20 milliards mentioned in Annex 2. The provisions of Annex 2, paragraph 12 (c) 1, with regard to the issue of new bonds therefore&quot;in no way affect the absolute obligation imposed upon Germany by Article 235.In any case, the total amount of the 20 milliard gold marks due under Article 235 is due for payment by the 1st May, 1921 : the test is imperative, and failure to carry gut this Article renders Germany liable to penalties in the same way as any other default in respect of her obligations.These facts having been established, it emerges that the German Government, by sending a definitive negative reply to the general requirement of the Commission to carry out the stipulations of Article 235, and in particular by refusing to pay the specific sum of 1 milliard gold marks required by the 22nd March, is in default in respect of the performance &apos;of her obligations and engagements.The Reparation Commission has therefore decided, in accordance with paragraph 17 of Annex 2 to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles, to give immediate notice of such default to each of the Powers interested.(Signed)        DUBOIS.JOHN BRADBURY.
