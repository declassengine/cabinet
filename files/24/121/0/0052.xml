[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.[The following proposals are the result of prolonged discussion between my own Department and the Treasury, and are now put forward jointly from the two Departments.]IlN the summer of 1920, the Lords Justices and Judges of the High Court wrote to the Lord Chancellor and to the Lord Chief Justice on the subject of their financial position, and requested them to bring the matter before the Cabinet.They pointed out that their salaries were fixed many years ago when the pound sterling was of a very different value to what it is at the present time, before any direct tax was payable,* and at a time when the present incomes earned at the Bar were unknown. They drew attention to the fact that under present conditions the net amount which remained, after deducting income tax and super-tax, was not only very much less than it was a few years ago, but its purchasing power had materially decreased. In 1914, each  1,000 of salary was worth, after deduction of tax, about  920; in 1919 this had fallen to about  640, the purchasing power of which was  300 or thereabouts. The Judges did not complain of having been obliged very greatly to curtail expenditure in many directions, but they expressed the view that it was not desirable that they should be forced into a standard of living which was hardly consistent with the position held for so many years by His Majesty&apos;s Judges.This letter was signed by the live Lords Justices, by all the Judges of the Chan-cery Division, and by all the Judges of the King&apos;s Bencli Division, except Mr. Justice Darling.It appeared to the Lord Chancellor that the statements contained in this letter are well founded, and that he would be failing in his duty if he did not bring the matter before the Cabinet.The facts with regard to the increased scale of.taxation and to the decreased value of money are fully before the Cabinet, and it does not appear necessary to discuss at length this view of the matter further than to point out that the civilian, naval and military servants of the Crown, with the exception of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers, have already received an addition to their emoluments with a view to making up in some degree the loss consequent upon the new financial situation. The County Court Judges, too, are in receipt of a war bonus (of  750 a year).It is no doubt true that those in receipt of large salaries are in a better position to bear the inconveniences consequent upon a complete change in the value of money. But a point has now been reached, and, in the view of the Lord Chancellor, was reached some two or three years ago, at which these inconveniences have, in the case of the Judges, amounted to an intolerable burden.Meanwhile, the fees earned by a leader in good practice at the Bar have increased very materially. Samples taken by the.Inland Revenue officials of the professional income of a number of leading Counsel excluding the Law Officers show a steady increase since the year 1916-17, the average in 1920-21 being  6,814. This figure probably does not reflect the full increase which has taken place. The income tax assessment is based normally on trie average of the income of the three preceding years, and the year in which a leader is promoted to the Bench is, as a general rule, a year when his income is still on the upward: grade. This conclusion, which might be deduced from a balance of probabilities, is confirmed by an examination of the actual returned incomes of those who have recently been made Judges. It should further be said that, haying regard to the delicacy of the questions involved, no directions were or could be given to the Inland Revenue as to the names of the Counsel (and Judges) whose incomes they were to investigate, and it is probable that their averages have been taken over a number who are not within the narrow circle from which a promoting-tion would be made if a vacancy were to occur at the present juncture. It is certain* This statement is quoted from the Judg&apos;es&apos;s letter. Presumably the meaning is that the salaries were by Statute exempt from tax.f5861] U
that the fees paid to those few Counsel who would receive consideration upon such an occasion are greatly in excess of the fees earned by Counsel in a similar position twenty, fifteen or even seven years ago, and that their incomes would show a propor-tionate increase. Twenty years ago one gentleman who then occupied the leading position in highly remunerated work at the Common Law Bar (Law Officers and ex-Law Officers being excluded) and who has since held all but the highest judicial preferment, earned during his last and most profitable year slightly over  13,000 and considered himself to have done well. Incomes greatly in excess of this are now earned by several members of the Bar, and incomes not far from it are earned by leading Counsel, who could not claim to occupy the pre-eminent position then held by the gentleman referred to.*At all times elevation to the Bench has been accompanied usually by some reduction in income, but that reduction has been of such moderate extent as not to outweigh the compensations involved in a relaxation of the strenuous life of a very busy leader, and the dignity of the position. The sacrifice now called for, however, is of such a nature as to be disproportionate to the advantages gained. A man still in the prime of life with children whose educa-tion is still incomplete, or who are not launched upon a remunerative profession, cannot afford to give up an income of some  6,000 or  7,000 a year with a tendency to increase.As a result, the choice of possible Judges is seriously restricted: those who are placed upon the Bench have Counsel arguing before them who are earning incomes out of all proportion to their own, and there is a serious risk, which is likely to become a certainty, that elevation to the High Court Bench will be regarded, as elevation to the County Court Bench is regarded, as an indication that the new Judge has not achieved the highest rank in his profession or is already conscious of failing powers.So serious is the situation, that certain Judges now upon the Bench have been forced to consider the question of returning to the Bar. There can be no doubt that if they do so they would immediately earn an income at least double that which they are at present receiving. The temptation is very great, and if such an event were to happen, the blow at the prestige of the Bench and at our whole judicial system would be calamitous and irretrievable.It is, therefore, necessary that the salaries of the Judges should be increased  not to an extent which would place them in the same relative position as that which they occupied before the war, but so as to alleviate the present conditions. The question then arises whether this increase should be by way of bonus or by a permanent addition.The present salaries are fixed by Statute, and any addition to them must in strictness be effected upon similar authority. It is true that in the case of certain officers whose salaries are fixed by Statute, bonus has been granted without any amendment of the Law. Instances are the County Court Judges and the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The irregularity of this course is, however, recognised, and it is proposed to obtain legislative sanction for it on the first convenient opportunity. Further, not only would the grant of a bonus, dependent upon the will of Ministers from, time to time to propose it to Parliament and the willingness of Parliament to grant it, be inconsistent with the dignity of the position of a High Court Judge, but such a course would cut at the root of the present theory of the tenure of the judicial office. The position of a Judge of the Supreme Court has been most carefully shielded by Parliament. His salary is charged on the Consolidated Fund; constitu-tional doctrines forbid criticism in Parliament on his actions except on certain well-defined conditions; and he is only removable from office upon an address from both Houses. If his emoluments were to include two elements one charged upon the Consolidated Fund and withdrawn from consideration in Parliament, the other depending upon the direct Parliamentary vote open to discussion the evils against which such careful provision has been made would at once be present. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Chancellor are, therefore, clearly of* Note.-It is difficult to ascertain what were precisely the emoluments of Judges and Counsel respectively at the beginning of the 19th century. The great judicial officers, besides the salaries and fees to which they were entitled, had in their gift offices which were sinecures and carried very large incomes. It appears from Campbell&apos;s &quot; Lives of the Lord Chief Justices&quot; that Lord Kenyon left, or expected to leave,  -250,000 (vol. Ill, p. 93). Lord Ellenborough left &quot;above  240,000 to his family besides the office of Chief Clerk of the King&apos;s Bench commuted to his son for  7,000 a year during life.&quot; Lord Tenterden left &quot; not a splendid but a competent fortune to his family.&quot; As to Counsel, &quot; Erskine in all his glory never Teached  10,000 a year ; yet Abbott (Lord. Tenterden) is known in the year 1807 to have made a return to the Income Tax of  8,026 5s. as the produce of his professional earnings in the preceding year, and he is supposed afterwards to have exceeded that amount.&quot;
i - *opinion that any improvement in the remuneration of the Judges of the Supreme Court must be effected by Statute.In these circumstances, the Lord Chancellor has been in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and now puts forward the present Bill for the consideration of the Cabinet.The Judges who would be affected by the proposals of the Bill are shown on the accompanying table. The number affected is, in England, 1 Lord Chief Justice of England, 1 Master of the Rolls, 1 President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, 6 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, 5 Lords Justices and 24 Puisne Judges (6 in the Chancery Division, 17 in the King&apos;s Bench Division, and 1 in the Probate Divorce &quot;ai.d Admiralty Division). It will be remembered that, as respects the King&apos;s Bench Judges, any vacancy occurring can only be filled upon an address from both Houses of Parliament so long as the filling of the vacancy keeps the number above 15. The numbers in Scotland are 1 Lord President (Lord Justice General), 1 Lord Justice Clerk and 11 Lords of Session; in Ireland, 1 Lord Chief Justice, 1 Master of the Rolls, 2 Lords Justices and 9 Puisne Judges. The office of the Lord Chancellor is included in the table, but it will be observed that no proposal is made for any increase in his case.The proposals in respect of the other Judges are the lowest which appear to be consistent with reason. In making them it has been necessary to have regard, so far as possible, to the relative dignity of those affected; for this reason the proposal in respect of the Lord Chief Justice of England is that he should receive an addition equal only to 18f per cent, of his present salary, bringing his total salary to  9,500 a year/ This would be only  500 a year less than that of the Lord Chancellor. For similar reasons, the increase proposed in the case of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and the Master of the Rolls is limited to 25 per cent, in each case.The proposal made with reference to the President of the Probate Court requires some further observations. It will be observed that it is proposed that his salary should be raised so as to be in excess of that proposed for a Lord Justice or a Puisne Judge, but below that of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and the Master of the Rolls. It has long been felt that it was anomalous that the salary of the President, who is the chief of one of the Divisions of the High Court, should be as it is at present, on the same scale as that of the Lords Justices and the Puisne Judges. The duties laid upon the President are considerably in excess of those performed by an ordinary member of the Court of Appeal or a Puisne Judge. He has the administrative direction of the Probate Registry and upon him lies the responsibility for the conduct of the work of his Division. That work has increased enormously in recent years both in Admiralty and in divorce, and though the judicial staff of the Division still consists nominally of only two Judges the President and one Puisne Judge for some years the work has been such as to require the time of four Judges, and help for this purpose has had to be supplied from the King&apos;s Bench Division. On the two last occasions on which the office fell vacant, it was filled by the appointment of one of the Lords Justices Lord Justice Pickford (now Lord Sterndale) and Sir Henry Duke. Each of these Judges undertook the office, greatly against his will, as a patriotic duty, exchanging work which he preferred for work which he disliked and accepting a heavy load of additional labour and responsibility. It does not appear proper that such a state of things should continue, or that the Prime Minister, when choosing the President of a Division whose importance has so largely increased in recent years, should be fettered in his choice by being obliged to find a Judge who will accept the office at a disadvantage to himself.So far as Scotland is concerned, it will be observed that it is proposed that the Lord President should receive a slightly greater increase than would accrue to him if the same rule which is being applied in England were applied rigidly in Scotland. If he were granted a,bare 25 per cent., as in the case of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and the Master of the Rolls, his salary (now  5,000) would be  6,250. This would raise the difficulty that, whereas that Judge has at present the same salary as an English Puisne judge, he would in future have a less salary than an English Puisne Judge, and it is therefore proposed to grant to him a further increase, raising his total to  6,500 (that proposed for an English Puisne Judge). The applica-tion of the rigid 30 per cent, increase to the Lords of Session would result in a salary of  4,680.  It is proposed that they should be granted the round figure of  4,600.As regards-Ireland, several -difficulties arise. The Bill makes no proposal for an increase in the salary of the ,ord Chancellor of Ireland on the ground that he,[586 f] B 2
being a political officer like the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, must receive the same treatment. On the coining into operation of the Government of Ireland Act, however, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland will become purely a judicial officer, and it would appear that it would be then necessary that he should receive the same treat-ment as other judicial officers. The addition proposed to the salary of the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland is 20 per cent., raising him thus from  5,000 to  6,000. If he were given an increase similar to that proposed for the Master of the Rolls in England, his salary would exceed that of the Lord Chancellor.The exact application of the 30 per cent, increase to the Irish Puisne Judges would result in a salary of  4,550. It is proposed to grant the round figure of  4,500.There is the further difficulty that the Irish Bench is considered to be over-manned and it is a question whether it should not be made a condition of the present proposals that reductions should be made in the judicial establishment. The question is complicated by the proposals of the Government of Ireland Act for the establish-ment of separate judiciaries in Northern and Southern Ireland.It appears desirable, in putting before Parliament proposals for the increase in judicial salaries, to deal at the same time in uniform fashion with the pensions of those now in office or who may hereafter be appointed. The present pension arrangements, which have grown up haphazard, differ as respects different countries and different judicial officers, and a continuation of the existing ratio of pension to salary after the increase to be effected by the Bill would continue and emphasise existing anomalies. Thus, the pension of thp Lord Chief Justice of England is now  4,000, being half his salary, while the p .sion of the Master of the Rolls is  3,750 (which is five-eighths), and that of the ihef Judges of the Supreme Court in England are fixed amounts equivalent to y ^ven-tenths of their salaries. In Scotland the pension is three-quarters of the sale ry, and in Ireland two-thirds. The result of the additions proposed by the Bill would entirely upset the relativity of the pensions if the same ratio of pension to salary is to be continued; thus, the new pension of the Lord Chief Justice of England would be  4,750, whereas that of the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division (whose salary is now  3,000 Jess, and would, under the Bill, be  2,500 less) would be  4,900, and the difference between the pension of the Lord Chief Justice and the pension of a Puisne Judge would only be  250 instead of  500 as at present, the difference in salary being  3,000 as at present. Again, the pension of the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland would be  4,875 as against  4,750 in the case of the Lord Chief Justice of England (that is,  125 more), although the salary of the former would be  3,000 less.It is, therefore, proposed that there should be introduced by the Bill a uniform system of fixing the pension at two-thirds of the salary for all Judges of all the superior Courts throughout the United Kingdom. As a result, the ratio of pension to salary would be diminished in Scotland in every case and in England as respects the majority of the Judges (there is a slight increase in the case of the Lords of Appeal and Master of the Rolls) and be unaltered in Ireland, but the amount of pension for those now in office would, by reason of the increase of salary, be increased in every case. The number of judicial pensioners is not at any time very great. The average number of ex-Judge pensioners (not being ex-Lord Chancellors) alive at the end of the last ten financial years was England    ...         ...        ...        ...        ...      12Scotland 1 ^Ireland   J &quot;&quot;20It has been already observed that the case of the Lord Chancellor has been excluded from consideration; the ex-Lord Chancellors (Lord Halsbury, Loreburn, Haldane, Buckmaster and Finlay) have also been excluded. In normal course, each ex-Lord Chancellor draws a pension of  5,000 per annum. In fact, Lord Finlay draws no pension, and Lord Loreburn only a pension of  2,500. It must be remembered that although these sums are drawn in the name of pension, ex-Lord Chancellors, in fact, render indispensable service&apos; in sitting judicially in the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and of those enumerated
only Lord Halsbury and Lord Loreburn have now ceased to sit and can properly be regarded as pensioners. The same observation is in some measure true of the ex-Judges. Lords Wrenbury and Phillimore sit regularly in the House of Lords and on the Judicial Committee, and Sir Arthur Channel sits on the Judicial Committee whenever his assistance is required.Lastly, advantage has been taken of this opportunity to include in the Bill provisions which have for some time been contemplated for other reasons, with  reference to the Indian members of the Judicial Committee.By the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, section 30, it was provided that &apos;; two members of His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council who shall have held the office of Judge in the East Indies or any of His Majesty&apos;s dominions beyond the seas and who, being appointed for that purpose by His Majesty, shall attend the sittings of the Judicial Committee &quot; should receive from the Consolidated Fund what was called an &quot; indemnity &quot; for their expenses amounting to  800 in all (i.e.,  400 to each Judge when there are two). It has become increasingly evident that in present conditions it is no longer reasonable to expect Judges from India to make the personal sacrifice which service on the Judicial Committee now entails, and what is proposed is that the two Judges from India should be placed as regards their remuneration on a footing precisely similar to that of Members of the Council of India, i.e., that they should receive salaries of  1,200 a year, or, if they were domiciled in India at the time of their appointment, of  1,800 a year. At the present time one of the members who draws the indemnity is an Indian, the other is not.The total estimated cost of the additions made by the Bill is as follows : --	England.	Scotland.	Ireland.Salaries Pensions	Per annum.   56,000 13,000	Per annum.   13,700 1,500	Per annum.   13,000 3,000and as respects India -				If both members are Indians.	If one member is Indian.	If neither mem-ber is Indian.Salaries Pensions	Per annum.   2,800 nil.	Per annum.   2,200 nil.	Per annum.   1,600 nil.So far as the pensions are concerned, the annual cost cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy without elaborate actuarial calculations. A rough guess, however, can be made from examination of the relation between the pensions paid and salaries drawn during the last ten years, and the estimates set out above have been framed on this basis.In connection with this matter, it must be remembered that the cost of the Judicial establishment does not fall wholly upon the taxpayer. A large contribution towards that cost is made by the litigant. In the course of the year 1920 the scale of fees on writs, &amp;c., was doubled, and this measure has produced up to the present additional revenue of  18,proof which it is estimated in a completed year will amount to  29,000;* Proposals for further increases in the scale of fees are now before a Committee which is about to report, and it is anticipated that as a result of that report and the steps to be taken upon it further additional revenue will be secured.Salaries of Judges.Comparison of present and proposed salaries on the basis of a 30 per cent, increase for Puisne Judges, 25 per cent, for Law Lords and the Master of the Rolls, and an increase for the Lord Chief Justice which will maintain the due relativity of his post.* These figures relate to the Central Office only.   It is not possible to estimate the additional revenue in the District Registries.
