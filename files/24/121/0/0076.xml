OKWSUS OF PRODUQTXQU.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.On Karon 3rd the Cabinet decided as followsJ&apos;-&quot;That the partial Census for 1920 should be dropped, and that the Hoard of Trade should be authorised to proceed with the arrangements for7&apos;holding in 19132 a Census of Production for 1921&apos;&apos;.It is now too late to make an Order authorising a Census in respect of 1921 as under the *sot this should have been made prior to 1st January, 1921.The earliest year for which tho necessary steps can be taken is therefore 1022, mid I should be glad to know if the decision of 3rd March is to be interpreted as authorising the Board of Trade to make arrangements for taking in 1923 a Census of Production for 1922.It will be realised that in the absence of a partial census for 1920, no results can now bo made available for about 3 years from the present time.R.S.K0rSE, 30.3.21,
