(p. 1402) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 3154Ivlll March 1921.(Received 16th, 8 a.m.)Priority A.369 S.   Afghanistan.   Following&apos; from Dobbs, 6!) C, dated J3lh March : &quot; Muspratt and 1 explained British attitude to Tarsi and two of his assistants at private conversation yesterday. I said that revelations regarding Bolshevik motives for making an agreement with. Afghanistan had convinced both the British Govern-ment and public that their sole object was to cause trouble in India. Consequently it was impossible for us to sign an agreement with Afghanistan without certainty that there would be nothing in Bolshevik treaty injurious to British Government. Amir had assured us in general terms that, if he made treaty of friendship with us, this condition would be fulfilled. But such general assurance was not sufficient because, for instance, Amir assumed that he could arrange that Russian Consulate on our border should he innocuous, while we were convinced that he could not. There might be many other provisions of Bolshevik treaty which Afghanistan might consider, in good faith, innocuous, but which we, who are best judges of our own interests, would consider harmful. It was, therefore, imperative that we should see contents of Bolshevik draft treaty before signing ours. To show that such a demand could be complied with, 1 handed him a translation of British draft agreement with the Bolsheviks taken by Krassin to Moscow, which was published authoritatively in English newspapers. Tarsi replied that he could not disclose Bolshevik draft before seeing the whole of what Britain was prepared to offer. I said, after some argument, 1 would hand him immediately our draft on the understanding that it could not be signed until we know terms of Bolshevik draft, and that, it&apos; that contained any provision contrary to our interests, draft must be amended, so as to provide against such provision. Tarsi replied that he understood my meaning. I then handed him our draft treaty, and he said he would inform me to-day whether he wished to discuss it in private or official meetings, lie told me S. had visited him that day for first time for three months, and had three hours&apos; conversation. It seems likely that S.&apos;s object was to contradict reports of Bolshevik trouble which I discussed with Tarsi.&quot;
