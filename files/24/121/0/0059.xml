Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES ON CLAUSES. Clause LAt present an officer of the Indian Army who considers himself wronged by his commanding officer may, under section 180 (2) [d) of the Army Act, complain to an officer appointed by the commander-in-chief who has to report to the Governor-General, and under the Government of India Act an officer has a right of appeal from the Governor-General to the Secretary of State. This clause substitutes a right to complain direct to the Governor-General, who is, if desired by the officer, to report to the Secretary of State for the purposes of ascertaining His Majesty&apos;s pleasure.Clause 5.This clause enables a soldier to be punished for stealing or embezzling, &amp;c, money or goods belonging to the Navy, Army and Air Force institutes, in the same way as for stealing, embezzling, &amp;c, money or goods the property of a comrade or belonging to any regimental institution.Clause 6.This clause reduces the maximum sentence which may be imposed on a soldier for drunkenness from two years&apos; imprisonment to six months&apos; detention where the offence is committed neither on active service nor on duty, but at the same time increases the maximum fine which may be imposed for drunkenness from one pound to five pounds, where the offence is dealt with by court-martial ; and from ten shillings to two pounds, where the offence is dealt with summarily by a commanding officer.Clause 7.The effect of this clause is to repeal that part of section 46 which limits the period of detention to be -6 A
awarded by a commanding officer for absence without leave to one day for each day&apos;s absence. The result will be that the maximum period of detention in this as in other cases will be 28 days.Clause 8.This clause (a) enables charges against officers below the rank of field officer to be dealt with summarily by any officer of the rank of major-general or of higher rank appointed by the Army Council, whether or not he holds a court-martial warrant, and (b) enables charges against an officer which can he summarily dealt with to be so dealt with, if the accused consents, after reading a summary of the evidence, without necessarily taking oral testimony on oath.Clause 9.Subsection (1) (a) of this clause raises by the sum of one and sixpence in the case of a warrant officer, Class II., and sixpence in the case of a soldier other than a warrant officer, the maximum portion of his daily pay which may be deducted and appropriated in liquidation of a sum adjudged to be paid for the maintenance of his wife and children.Subsection (1) (b) of the clause deals with the liability of a discharged soldier to be committed to prison in respect of arrears of maintenance which have accumu-lated whilst he was serving. The proposed subsection limits the liability to cases where it can be proved that the man has since his discharge been, or is at the time the committal order is asked for, able to pay and has failed to do so.Clause 10.This clause fixes the maximum quantities of food and drink which the keeper of a victualling house may be required to furnish to a soldier billeted on him on a revised scale which will he more in accordance with the ration ordinarily issued by the Army.
