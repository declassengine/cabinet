PART I-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.The most important development in the general industrial situation which has taken place in the course of the week is the formal invitation of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives to the Triple Alliance, requesting the latter body to take into immediate consideration the question of convening a conference of the principal trade unions affected, to formulate a common policy to meet the attack alleged to be contemplated by employers on wages and conditions of work. The trade unions which the Federation wish to take part in the conference are the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, the National Union of Railwaymen, the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives. The proposal of the building trades federation was appa-rently put forward at a meeting of the emergency committee on the 8th March, and will be discussed on the 17th by the sub-committee of the Triple Alliance, which consists of the presidents and secretaries of the constituent bodies. It will be remembered that the sub-committee of the Alliance also met on the 8th March to consider the advisability of calling a full conference of the Alliance to discuss the position created in the coal mining&apos; industry by the Governments proposals for decontrol, and decided not to convene such a conference at the present time. The proposal of the building trades federation is in consonance with recently expressed opinions of prominent officials in the National Trans-port Workers&apos; Federation, the Miners&apos; Federation, and also the National Union of Rail-waymen. It appears very probable, however, that the Triple Alliance will pass on the request of the building trades to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.The conferences between employers and employed which have taken place in the course of the week have not led to any conclusive results. The principal conferences have been concerned with the mining, shipbuilding and engineering industries, and in each case reductions in wages are definitely proposed. The meeting of the National Maritime Board on the 17th March will bring the seafaring industry into the list of trades in which wages reductions are imminent. The National Union of Railwaymen have now formulated a declaration hostile to decontrol, and in favour of the national-isation of railways, and the three unions concerned with the railway industry are now at one on these questions. It would appear that in many industries it is not necessarily plain wages reductions that will cause serious trouble. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the adoption of a cost-of-living sliding scale, at the time when such a scale will probably mean a series of reductions in wages, is the declared policy of the unions in the building, hosiery and vehicle building trades, and in the latter two cases has been definitely put forward in response to employers&apos; demands for immediately reduced wages. What is very much feared, however, is that attempts will be made to alter the standard of conditions of work, the achievement of which by the trade unions concerned was so prominent a feature of the year 1919. The builders fear payment by results, and the railwaymen an attack upon their guaranteed 48-hour week : while the miners are sore at the action of the owners in deciding to terminate contracts of employment on the 31st March before the national negotiations with the Miners&apos; Federation have definitely proved abortive. This would appear to be the strongest force behind the proposals to raise special unemployment funds which are now being canvassed not only within the Miners Federation, but also within the National Union of Railwaymen and the boiler-makers&apos; society. In the case of the National Union of Railwaymen, the avowed purpose of raising the fund is to provide unemployed members with a more substantial main-tenance allowance in order to lessen the temptation to accept employment under worse conditions.The dispute in the vehicle building industry in Glasgow, Wales and the North and Midlands of England is notable as the most important dispute which has begun since tire lock-out of shipyard joiners on the 1st December,
FEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Building Trades. The position with regard to the proposal that 50,000 ex-Service men should be introduced into the building industry remains very uncertain. The outcome of the conference of the executives of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, which was held on the 3rd and 4th March, and of a meeting of the Emergency Committee of the Federation, which was held on the 8th March, was the issue of a manifesto protesting against the policy of the employers. This manifesto has been circulated to the constituent bodies of the Federation, and published in the press. The manifesto declares that the refusal of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives to entertain the Governmenfs proposal has resulted in an agreement between the Government and the National Federation of Building Trades Employers to force upon the operatives, not only the admission of the ex-Service men but also the acceptance of the principle of payment by results. It is true, the manifesto continues, that the Govern-ment would not consent to support the employers openly on the latter issue, but their support is enlisted in the event of a national lock-out occurring over the dilution proposals, and the employers will not scruple to use this as a means of bringing about payment by results. &quot; Dilution,&quot; it is stated, &quot; is but the bait for public consumption : the real issue is the enforcement of payment by results on an industry that has religiously refused to accept the same.&quot; The members are, therefore, urged to hold together in the deter-mination to resist the employers, but no indication is given, either of the methods by which the Federation intend to maintain this resistance, or that any final decision as to policy has yet been taken. The results of the ballot vote of the employers on the Governmenfs proposals have not yet been announced, and the operatives&apos; manifesto should probably be(b 17112T) 2 M: 2General Situation-continued.The definitive resignation of Mr. Sinillie from his position as president of the Miners&apos; Federation removes from the trade union world a notable figure, but the importance of this step in connection with the course of current negotiations should not be over-estimated. There is no one available, however, who can hope to fill the position which he occupied in the eyes of the rank and file of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.A further conference will be held at Montagu House on the 18th March in connection with the proposed formation of a National Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees. At Easter will commence the season of annual conferences of trade unions and other labour bodies wliich is completed in September every year with the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress. The principal Easter meetings will be political, the annual conference of the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Labour Party being held at that time. On the 31st March a conference will be held at Sheffield under the auspices of the National Administrative Council of Shop Stewards with the object of unifying all the unofficial trade union movements in England, Scotland and Wales.The Unemployment Position.Statistics. The number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 4th March was 337,701, of which 313,543 were lodged by men and 416 by women totally unemployed, and 23,681 by men and 61 by women working short time. On the 25th February there were 361,002 policies lodged, of which 337,635 were lodged by men and 483 by women totally unemployed, and 22,690 by men and 194 by women working short time.On the 4th March in the United Kingdom 1,593,923 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, of which 511,814 were lodged by males and 351,077 by females totally unemployed, and 299,365 by males and 428,667 by females working short time : an increase on the previous week of 50,191 totally unem-ployed and 7,303 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 11th March was 1,315,200. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ-ment Department, and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 283.
regarded rather as preparation for a possible struggle, than as a definite declaration on the part of the Federation that they intend to engage in such a struggle.Textile Industry. The position in the Lancashire textile industry was discussed at a meeting of Lancashire members of Parliament on the 9th March, when it was resolved to invite the employers&apos; organisations in the cotton industry, and the Manchester and Liverpool Chambers of Commerce to appoint representatives to attend a conference to consider the scheme put forward by Mr. R. AVaddington, M.P. for the Rossendale Division.* Mr. Tom Shaw, M.P., informed the meeting that the operatives are taking great interest in Mr. Waddington&apos;s proposals, and are very anxious to confer with other organisations as to their feasibility. The proposed conference will be convened by the committee of Lancashire Members of Parliament.In Yorkshire, it is reported that the General Union of Textile Workers have decided to curtail unemployment benefits, members being allowed only two weeks&apos; benefit, instead of eight, as at present. Members who, on the 12th March, have already drawn two or more weeks&apos; benefit during the past twelve months will not be entitled to any further payment. The executive state that they have been compelled to make this decision owing to the heavy drain already made on the funds, and the fact that the great increase in membership during the last few years has made it impossible to create any reserve. Members who are unemployed will be excused from paying contributions, and all members will still be entitled to strike or lock-out pay and to legal assistance.railways-The position with regard to unemployment is reported to be serious, and the number of dismissals is said to be increasing. The National Union of Railwaymen have decided to impose a levy of Gd. per week upon all their members engaged on, or in connec-tion with, the railways, to enable the union to deal with any crisis that may arise in the present condition of the country. In a circular issued to the members by Mr. C. T. Cramp it is stated that the additional funds obtained by means of the levy will be used to increase the unemployment benefit paid by the union, and to strengthen the resistance of unemployed members to the acceptance of wages below existing rates. The practice of offering men work on a lower grade, in lieu of dismissal, is strongly disapproved by the executive, as tending to lower the standard of employment and to force the industry to pre-war condi-tions. An instance of this practice having been conditionally agreed upon, how-ever, is reported on the North Eastern Railway, where 100 men on the permanent staff are stated to have been offered temporary employment on a lower grade, with the prospect of hltimate reinstatement, either in their present positions, or in positions equivalent in status to those positions. The trade union representatives on the Conciliation Board agreed to accept this offer on behalf of the men concerned : and the conditions under which such substitution should take place in this and in any other cases that may occur, have been fully worked out by the Board. It has also been decided that these arrangements shall remain in force for three months, at the end of which period the whole position will be reviewed.Miners. The proposed scheme of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain for the institution of a special national unemployment relief fund is now under consideration by the districts of the federation. From the reports so far received, it would appear that the scheme has been favourably considered by many of the district conferences: on the other hand, a mass meeting of miners on the 14th March, at Sutton (Notts.), to consider the scheme, is reported to have rejected, by a large majority, a resolution in its favour. The replies of the districts are to be returned to the federation not later than the 19th March and, if the scheme is endorsed, the federation hope to bring it into operation as from the 28th March.Control of Industry.Railways. The National Union of Railwaymen have now published a statementf embodying the views of the union on the Ministry of Transports proposals for the organisa-tion of the British railways. This statement is very similar to the memorandum issued jointly by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and the Railway Clerks&apos; Association last January. J It declares that the National Union of Railwaymen have now examined the official proposals contained in the White Paper (Cmd. 787),$ and desire, through representatives of the executive committee, to place the views of the* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 10, 5th March, p. 221.f See &quot; Railway Review,&quot; 11th March, 1921, p. 8.t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 5, 29th January, pp. 100 and 101.i See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25,18th December, p. 678.
27119.8.21;union before the Minister of Transport. These views are, briefly, that, while welcoming the official proposals in so far as they would increase the control of the State over the railways, grant a legal right to the&apos; employees to share in the management, and reduce the number of separate railway systems, the union consider that the most efficient and economical railway service can only be obtained under conditions of State ownership and national control.In view of their fundamental objection to the official proposals, the union have not considered it necessary to deal with those proposals point by point, but have briefly summarised the line of argument which the deputation to the Minister of Transport will follow. The questions of ownership, management, wages and working conditions, citizenship and unemployment are dealt with as follows : &quot; Ownersfiip.-The proposal of the Government is that the railways of Great Britain should be formed, (if possible by the voluntary amalgamation of the existing companies) into six or seven groups.&quot; The proposal of the National Union of Railwaymen is that the whole of the railway system of Great Britain should be State-owned, and should be under a single national control of a Minister of Transport responsible to Parliament.&quot; Management. The Government proposal on management is that a Board of about twenty-one members should manage each of the grouped railways ; that a majority on the Board should represent the shareholders (a proportion of the members holding large trading interests); and that the remaining members should represent the employees (two-thirds elected by and from the workers on the railway, and one-third leading administrative officials co-opted by the rest of the Board).&quot; The National Union of Railwaymen&apos;s proposal is that the State-owned railways should be managed by a national board, composed of an equal number of representatives nominated (a) by Parliament, and (b) by the railway workers acting through their trade union.&quot; Wages and Working Conditions. In addition to the permanent machinery proposed by the Government on the lines of the Central and National Wages Boards, the National Union of Railway-men propose that district boards should be established, and that their functions should embrace all questions arising out of the men&apos;s employment, including questions of discipline and management. The constitution of the proposed district boards was discussed with the Minister at a meeting held on the 21st October, 1920.&quot; Citizenship-Complete civic freedom must be retained by railway workers under any form of ownership and control of railways.&quot; Displaced Raihvaymen. Adequate compensation should be paid to any employee discharged as a result of a reduction in the permanent staff.&quot;Coal Mining Industry. The delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain passed a further resolution with regard to the Government^ policy on the question of decontrol at their meeting on the 10th March. The resolution was in the following, terms: &quot; That this conference enters its most emphatic protest against the callous action of the Govern-ment in repudiating its responsibility, to the coal industry immediately the condition of the coal trade rendered the control of the industry of no further financial advantage to them, and before any effective scheme for the future control of the industry by the owners and the workers had been established.&quot;A joint conference, representative of some 14 manufacturers&apos; associations, was&apos;held under the auspices of the Federation of British Industries on the 10th March, and passed resolutions recording opposition to the scheme put forward by the Miners&apos; Federation for the unification of all the collieries in Great Britain, and the adoption of a national wages basis and a pool: and expressing the opinion that there could be no real revival of trade, or increase in employment, until the price of coal was substantially reduced.The Mining Association of Great Britain have informed the Miners&apos; Federation that customary notices, to expire on the 31st March, to terminate contracts of employment would be given in the various districts in order that the owners may be relieved of their responsibilities with regard to advanced in wages given by the Government to the workmen during the period of control. Action on these lines by the Durham and Northumberland coal owners had been reported on the 8th March ; and at meetings of the South Wales and Scottish Conciliation Boards held on the 14th, the reasons for this step were explained to the representatives of the miners by Mr. Evan Williams and Sir Adam Nimmo, respectively. Mr. Williams affirmed that the giving of the notices in no way constituted a lock-out, and that the owners hoped as a result of the negotiations now proceeding to arrive at an agree-ment on the wages to be paid from the 1st April. At the South Wales meeting, Mr. James Winstone put forward the view of the miners that such notices should not be tendered while negotiations were proceeding.
Trade Union Topics.Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. It is announced that Mr. Robert Smillie has resigned his position as President of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, owing to ill health. His resignation was accepted by the special delegate conference held on the 10th March, and the following resolution was passed unanimously: &quot; That we accept Mr. Smillie&apos;s resignation with regret, and thank him for his long and valuable services to the M ners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and trust that he will long be spared to serve, as best he can, and as his health will permit, the great Labour movement in general, and the miners&apos; cause in particular.&quot;Mr. Herbert Smith, vice-president, will officiate as acting president until the next annual conference of the Federation in July.Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Movement. It is reported that the unofficial reform move-ment among the coal miners., which began in the Blantyre district in Scotland,* has now spread to the West Lothian district. A meeting was held at Bathgate, West Lothian, on the 13th March, when delegates from the various collieries represented discussed the forma-tion of a local branch of the Miners&apos; Unofficial Reform Committee, and plans for the future organisation of the movement. A committee was formed to extend propaganda. Dissatisfaction was expressed concerning the methods adopted by the various miners&apos; unions ; it was stated that the miners had no voice in determining policy, and that the rank and file received no direct information of the action taken by the officials. It was decided that the only solution was for the miners to join with workers in other industries and to take control of the means of production.National Union of Railwaymen.   Information has now been received of the proceedings of the conference of the District Councils of the union which was held at Sheffield on the 29th January. Various resolutions were passed relating to the policy of the union and to matters of general interest. The first reaffirmed the principle of the nationalisation of the railways together with the right of the workers to participate in con-trol. A second resolution was adopted declaring that &quot; the Triple Alliance as presently constituted is ineffective to combat the growing strength of the employing classes,&quot; and &quot; that all national movements of the miners, transport workers, and railwaymen shall run concurrently ; that no movement of a national character be launched by any of the parties to the Alliance until the others are ready to come alongside with their movement, and that no settlement arrived at between the union concerned and the employers shall be accepted until the other parties to the Alliance are prepared to accept the terms offered to them.&quot;Other resolutions were carried expressing regret that no standard conditions of service had been laid down for shopmen members of the union, and deploring the action of the Amalgamated Engineering Union in declining to negotiate jointly with the National Union of Railwaymen. The practice of short-time working was condemned, and a resolution was passed instructing the executive council to resist any attempt to encroach on the guaranteed week.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation.-With reference to the scheme for the amalga-mation of the unions of transport and general workersf it is now reported that the ballot taken by the National Union of Docks, Wharves and. Shipping Staffs, who include in their membership the clerical staff of the Port of London Authority, has resulted in a large majority in favour of the scheme. It will be remembered that the scheme provides for the establishment of five national group committees, one of which will be representative of clerical, administrative and supervisory workers, and each of these committees has the right to elect a member of the General Executive Council of the new union. The voting, there-fore, is of some interest in view of the general reluctance of clerical workers to organise themselves in conjunction with manual workers.International Relations of Labour.International Ship Owners and Seamen&apos;s Conference. Mention has already been made in a previous issue of this report of an International Conference of Ship Owners and Seamen held at Brussels, in Januaryrof this year, to discuss hours of labour on board ship, and of the setting up by the conference of two commissions, to examine and report upon the technical details involved, one commission dealing with the deck and engine room staffs, and the other* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 631. f See this Report, Vol. II, No. 17, 23rcl October, p. 483.

27319.3 21.NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Builders (National). The building trades are now waiting upon the decisions of the operatives with regard to the proposed wages sliding scale, based upon the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; cost-of-living index-number. The acceptance of this sliding scale by the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives will bring into operation the National Wages and Conditions Council, who will supersede the present Conciliation Board machinery. The decision of the operatives will be known immediately after the 4th April, and a meeting of the National Wages and Conditions Council will take place on the 11th April.The National Conciliation Board for the Building Trades met on the 14th March, and decided to refer all the wages appeals pending from the district conciliation boards to the meeting on the 11th April of the Wages and Conditions Council. Should the opera-tives accept the sliding scale proposal, it is anticipated that the Wages and Conditions Council will suspend these appeals, and that wages in the building trades will be auto-matically adjusted nationally on the 1st August in accordance with the sliding scale proposal.The sliding scale is now being discussed by the various constituent bodies of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, and its acceptance has been recom-mended by the London District Council of the federation, and the officials of the federation are strongly urging its acceptance by the men.Engineers (National). The Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations met in conference at York, on the 9th March, the Federation of Engineering and Ship-building Trades, and, on the 10th March, the Amalgamated Engineering Union and repre-sentatives of those unions affiliated to the National Federation of General Workers who are concerned with the engineering trades. The employers&apos; representatives presented a statement respecting the position of the industry, with special reference to production, the state of trade and the cost of living.  No conclusions were reached at any of thesewith the general service staffs. The first session of the commission dealing with the deck and engine room staffs took place in London on the 25th February, with Mr. Havelock Wilson, C.B.E., M.P., in the chair. After a general discussion on procedure, it was decided, as a first step, to examine in detail, and to place on record, the actual hours now worked by firemen and trimmers on the ships of the several countries represented on the commission.Mr. Havelock Wilson outlined the existing working conditions of firemen and trimmers in British ships, and compared these conditions with those prevailing several years ago. The subject was considered from the point of view of hours at sea, hours in port, hours on day of arrival and on day of departure, in conjunction with such other matters as &quot; field days,&quot; heaving ashes, amount of coal consumption, and overtime.&apos;The Belgian representatives then commenced a similar record of the present conditions of firemen and trimmers on Belgian ships, but the commission adjourned until the 1st March before this part of the investigation had been completed.On the 1st March the commission completed the record of the technical details of the work of firemen and trimmers on Belgian, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish ships, and a statement was read giving particulars of the conditions obtaining on German ships. M. Damm, secretary of the International Seafarers&apos; Federation, then put forward, on behalf of the federation, a scheme for a 48-hour week at sea in the engine-room and stokehold departments ; Father Hopkins and Commander Walton were appointed to investigate the cost of the proposed scheme as compared with the present arrangements.At the meeting held on the 2nd March, the commission examined the working of the 48-hour week in the French mercantile marine, and decided to obtain details as to the cost of operating the three-watch system in Danish ships. M. Damm outlined a scheme proposed by the International Seamen&apos;s Federation for the institution of a three-watch system for deck crews. The commission then decided to adjourn until comparative tables as to the cost of the present and the proposed systems were ready for discussion.
conferences, which were adjourned for approximately a month, in order that the trade unions might give full consideration to the employers&apos; position and suggestions.The ballot of members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union on the proposed three-shift system* has now been completed. The result shows 56,487 votes in favour of the system and 27,751 votes against. The number of votes cast was approximately 20 per cent, of the membership of the union. This does not mean that the three-shift system will be generally adopted, but only that an agreed system now exists, which may be adopted by any particular firm after consultation locally with the men.Shipbuilders (National). A conference between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades was held at Newcastle on the 10th March. The employers suggested a reduction of 6s. per week in time-rates, and of 15 per cent, in piece-rates, as from the end of April. The trade union representatives decided to confer with their executives on the matter, and another conference will be held within a fortnight.Steel Trade Workers (Sheffield). The Sheffield and District Rolling Mills Proprietors&apos; Association have notified the trade unions concerned that they desire to take off the advances plus the 12i per cent, thereon which were given to the steel trade workers in the first week in May last as a compensation for the engineering trade advances in April and June, 1920. It is believed, however, that a few weeks may elapse before the parties get to serious issues.Tinplate Operatives (South Wales). The committee of the Industrial Council who are considering the proposal of the Welsh Plate and Sheet Manufacturers&apos; Association that the consolidation of half of the 50 per cent, special bonus with basic rates, and that the balance of 25 per cent, special bonus be discontinued in the case of operatives who are not governed by the new sliding scale agreement, met at Swansea on the 7th and 9th March, but arrived at no decision. The men concerned are-maintenance men, craftsmen, and other day workers, jSignalmen (National). The decision of the unofficial signalmen&apos;s national council not to recommend strike action, pending the result of the negotiations now in progress between the executive of the National Union of Railwaymen and the Negotiating Committee of Railway Managers, has been endorsed by a mass meeting of signalmen, held in London on the 10th March. At this meeting, it is reported, the delays in the negotiations were emphatically condemned, but the meeting appreciated the contention that industrial unity within the National Union of Railwaymen must be maintained, and that it would be contrary to the spirit and constitution of the union for the signalmen to undertake industrial action on their own account.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Nut and Bolt Operatives (Midlands). A meeting took place on the 7th March, under the auspices of the Workers&apos; Union and the National Union of General Workers, of representa-tives of workers involved in the strike in the Midlands nut and bolt trade at which it was decided that a resumption of work could be recommended on condition that the women received engineering trade rates, and that there should be no change in men&apos;s rates before the 30th June, discussions to take place between the unions and the employers in consonance with what might happen in the engineering trades proper.The Midlands Nut and Bolt Manufacturers&apos; Association met in Birmingham on the 10th March, to consider this offer, and decided that they could not depart from their previous attitude not to hold any further discussions on the wages&apos; questions with the operatives, or their trade unions,until both the men and women on strike had returned to work, the women to return at the new rates of wages. It was pointed out that it was not intended to make any reduction in the wages of men until the question had been thoroughly discussed with the trade unions concerned.A conference of representatives of the workers involved was held on the 13th March at which it was decided to take a ballot of the employees on strike, on the question of resump-tion on the employers&apos; terms.Electricians (Scotland). The only development reported in connection with the strike of members of the Electrical Trades Union employed by firms affiliated to the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland, which commenced on the 7th March, is that 18 firms in the Glasgow area are said to have withdrawn their notices for a reduction in wages of 3d. per hour, and their employees have resumed work.  The number of men affected by* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 25,18th December, p. 683. I See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 3, 15th January, p. 49.
this action is said to be 200. In view of the fact that the Electrical Trades Union put forward a claim for an increase in wages at the same time as the employers gave notice of the reduction, it would appear that they are not prepared to take drastic action in support of their own demands, but are willing to accept stabilisation.Vehicle Builders (National)-No improvement has taken place in the course of the week in the position of the vehicle building trades. In Scotland, some 550 workers in Glasgow and 50 in Dundee, employed by firms affiliated to the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association, ceased work on the 7th March. The notices of reductions issued by the firms affiliated to the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders expired on the 12th March, and from that date a lock-out has been in operation^ The existing agreement, however, between the trade unions and the National Federation of Vehicle Trades, which covers London and the South of England, and the Edinburgh District of Scotland, does not expire until the 22nd March, and a conference between the federation and the unions is to be held on the 16th March.The trade unions concerned in the negotiations with the three employers&apos; associations, are the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Society of Wheelwrights, Smiths and Kindred Trades, and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists. The policy of the first two of these unions has been determined by a ballot vote of their members. They will resist the immediate wages reduction insisted upon by the employers, but put forward, as an alternative, the institution of a wages sliding scale based upon the &quot; Labour Gazette &quot; cost-of-living index number, to come into operation not before the 20th June.Settlements and Agreements.Miners (National). A series of meetings with regard to the position in the coal industry took place on the 9th, 10th and 11th March, and a further series will take place on the 16th, 17th and 18th.The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met on the 9th, and com-pleted the details of the miners&apos; scheme for the future regulation of wages and profits in the industry, for submission to the national delegate conference on the following day. The conference adopted the scheme, as submitted by the executive, and instructed the execu-tive to communicate it to the Mining Association and to the Government.On the 11th March, a meeting took place between the negotiating committee of the executive of the Miners&apos; Federation and representatives of the Mining Association, at which no further progress was made towards an agreement, and, in the afternoon, the representatives of the Mining Association and the full executive of the Miners&apos; Federation met separately the President of the Board of Trade and communicated to him their respective schemes for the regulation of wages and profits in the industry.The text of neither of these schemes has been published, but the owners&apos; scheme was indicated by Mr. Evan Williams at the meeting of the Mining Association on the 2nd March, and, from the accounts which have appeared of the miners&apos; scheme, it may be judged that it is opposed to that of the owners in two respects. It provides that the industry should be treated as a single unit, the wages of each grade of workers to be on a uniform national basis, and the older and financially weaker collieries are to be assisted to pay such uniform wages from a national pool contributed to by the newer and financially stronger collieries. A National Wages Board, representative of employers and employed, is proposed &quot; to regulate the wages and profits in the industry.&quot; The miners also propose that the new standard wage should be made up of the present district base rates plus percentage additions, with the Sankey wage and war wage preserved as a combined flat rate in addition thereto. The miners&apos; scheme is also said to indicate the just proportion which the miners propose should be established between wages and profits. The minimum profit to the colliery undertakings is to be one-tenth of the amount of the standard wages, and the surplus remaining after meeting standard wages, minimum profits and other costs, is to be divided between miners and owners in the proportion of 10 to 1.The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation will meet on the 16th March in preparation for a conference between their negotiating committee and representatives of the Mining Association on the following day. On the .18th, the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation will again be in session.Wool Textile Workers (Scotland). A special general meeting of the Scottish Woollen Trade Employers&apos; Association was held in Edinburgh, on the 8th March, to discuss the&apos;   * In the case of a few firms in the Birmingham area the dispute commenced a week earlier. (B17112T) 2N
proposal of the unions involved, namely, the Scottish Industrial Woollen Workers, the National Union of General Workers and the Workers&apos; Union, that wages should be stabilised for a further six months as from the 31st March next. The employers resolved to int mate to the unions that they were wiling to stabilise wages until the 30th June next.Co-operative Employees (Grimsby and Stockton). The two local co-operative disputes have now been settled. The Grimsby dispute arose out of the proposal of the local co-operative society to adopt short-time working in the form of a 5-day week. It has been agreed that the society&apos;s proposal should not be put into operation. This dispute began on the 5th March and ended on the 7th, and minor difficulties with regard to the reinstatement of certain workers have been overcome.The Stockton dispute began on the 5th March, and work was resumed on the 8th. In this case, the operatives objected to reductions in staffs taking place, and preferred the working of short time. The terms oi the agreement arrived at provide that the 17 employees dismissed on account of the depression in trade shall be reinstated, and that the workers shall be laid off in turn in those departments where trade is slack for such periods as may prove necessary, provided that no employee shall be suspended for more than one day in any one week, or more than one week in any period of six weeks.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Department&apos;s Section of the Report, pages 211 to 281.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Railway Shopmen. At a special delegate conference on the 10th March the National Union of Railwaymen considered the proposal to refer to arbitration the whole question of the rates and conditions of the various grades of railway shopmen. It was decided to agree to the reference of the matter to the Industrial Court. The executive committee are considering the terms of reference.Electrical Workers on Railways outside London. On a request for an interpretation of Award No. 416, the Industrial Court decided that the men concerned are entitled to London rates, including the advance of 6s. per week, less 5 per cent, in Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, and less 10 per cent, in all other districts. The Court also decided that seven consecutive days&apos; holiday with pay, in the case of shift-workers, meant that the worker should have a rest period of seven consecutive days, for which period he should receive the same pay as he would ordinarily receive had he been working during that period that is, in the majority of cases, six days&apos; pay.  (Award No. 624.)Iron and Steel Wire Manufacturing.-^^ Industrial Council met at Manchester on the 9th March. It was agreed to send copies of a report from H.M. Inspector of Factories to all firms for consideration, and that, in any cases where the unions considered the firms were not complying with the recommendations of the report, the matter should be discussed at the District Council meetings.Consideration was given to a scheme for contracting out of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920). A representative of the National Union of General Workers, speaking on behalf of the ancillary workers, stated that they were prepared to go into the scheme, provided their members showed their willingness to do so on a ballot vote. Both the operatives and the employers seemed to be anxious to get the special scheme started.A Yorkshire firm have given notice, as from the 14th March, of a reduction, of from 3s. to 5s., to be made in the wages of certain classes of operatives. The operatives&apos; side suggested that, as this is a federated firm, their action was wrong, and that no reduction of wages should come without the sanction of the Council. The Chairman stated that, if the union decided to take any action in the matter, the firm would not be backed by the employers&apos; association. It was eventually decided that one of the Yorkshire employers on the Council, together with a representative of the union, should visit the firm.Scientific Instrument Makers (London). About fifty members of the Amalgamated . Engineering Union employed by Messrs. Heath &amp; Co., Ltd., came out on strike on the 24th February, as a result of the firm having posted a notice stating that wages must be reduced by approximately 25 per cent. At a meeting of the Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee on the 7th March, an agreement was arrived at that Messrs. Heath &amp; Co. should withdraw the notices and take back all men who were at work on the 24th February, and whq now desire to return.The next meeting of the Committee to consider a new wages agreement has been fixed for the 23rd March.Wrought Holloiv-ivare.-A meeting of the Industrial Council was held in Birmingham, on the 2nd March, to consider further the employers&apos; proposed reduction of wages. The workers&apos; side indicated that their members were strongly opposed to any reduction at the present time, and moved that the question be deferred for three months. The voting resulted in a tie. The chairman stated that the employers would meet, in the near future, to consider what action should be taken, and, further, that no reduction would be made operative until due notice had been given. If another conference was thought necessary the operatives would be notified. A joint committee of four a side was appointed to make recommendations to the Council relative to the rate of Exchange.(b 17112t) 2 N 2
fIndustrial Relations Department-continued.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.New Area Joint Council. The Chief Conciliation Officer, Newcastle, reports that the formation of the Building Trades&apos; Confederation of Employers on the North-East Coast was confirmed last week, and the chairman, vice-chairman and secretaiy were appointed. Further meetings are to be held to set up the necessary Area Joint Council machinery.Painters (Kiiu/s Lynn). The local master painters and decorators&apos; association are not affiliated to the Building Trade Employers&apos; Federation, and are not, therefore, a party to the Eastern Counties Area Grading Scheme. At the end of December the masters gave two months&apos; notice of their intention to reduce the painters&apos; rate from Is. lid. to Is. Id. per hour, with effect as from the 1st March. No negotiations between the parties took place in the meantime, but, on the 25th February, the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, to whom the operative painters are affiliated, decided to withdraw all classes of building trade labour in support of the painters as a protest against the proposed reduction.In the meantime the Chief Conciliation Officer was approached by the operatives, and every endeavour was made to prevent the withdrawal of labour pending negotiations. The painters, however, struck on the 1st March, in spite of their undertaking to remain at work&apos;. This was due to the further action of the employers in issuing a notice to the effect that working hours for painters would commence at 6.30 instead of at 8 o&apos;clock. With great difficulty the employers were induced to open negotiations with the workmen before work was resumed ; several meetings have now been held, under the chairmanship of an officer of the department, and although no settlement has yet been reached, some progress has been made in clearing up the points at issue between the parties.QUARRYING.Cement Manufacturing. The Industrial Council, on the 3rd March, refused an appli-cation from the United Order of General Labourers of Great Britain and Ireland for representation.As a result of an application for increased wages, it was resolved unanimously that the existing agreements be extended, subject to one calendar month&apos;s notice in writing by either side, such notice to expire on the 7th of any month after the 7th March.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Bakers. The Scottish Association of Master Bakers have now recommended that the national agreement shall remain in force until the 2nd April, or until superseded.The view expressed by the Glasgow employers, that they are no longer obliged to pay the recent increase, led to a threat to cease work. An emergency meeting of the executive committee of the association, however, decided to take no local action in the direction of a wage reduction. The Glasgow operatives, who previously advocated local agreements, have now resolved to support the executive in demanding a national agree-ment.As a result of the representations of the Chief Conciliation Officer, the employers appear less decided on the question of the suspension of the Council. The secretary of the asso-ciation has, in fact, suggested that the Council might usefully consider the setting up of a special scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920. In the hopes that an ultimate breakdown of the Council might thereby be prevented, the Chief Conciliation Officer has requested information on special schemes, and has suggested that an officer of the Employment Department might meet the Council and explain the workings of such schemes.Bakers (Hull). As a result of the dismissal of eight men who refused to work over-time, the operative bakers&apos; union threatened to call out all the bakers in Hull. The introduction of over-time is a distinct breach in the present agreement between the Hull Master Bakers&apos; Association and the union. The Chief Conciliation Officer succeeded in arranging a joint conference on the 10th March and negotiations are still proceeding.TRANSPORT.Carters (London and Home Counties). The National Union of Vehicle Workers preferred a claim, for an advance of 4s. per week, against the Metropolitan and Home Counties Road Transport Contractors&apos; Association, adducing in support of their claim the fact that, in December, 1920, the London Carters and Haulage Contractors&apos; Asso-eiation had granted a similar advance.  It was pointed out to the Industrial Court that
certain proposals had been made by the latter association to withdraw the advance given, and that negotiations following thereon had broken down. The Court granted an advance of 4s. per full ordinary week, effective from the beginning of the first pay period after the date of the award.   (Award No. 627.)POTTERY AND RUBBER.Potteries (Scotland). The Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., have now agreed that, pending-arbitration, as many employees as possible should be re-engaged on the old terms. In view of the state of the trade there is little prospect of work being resumed, except by two firms. The resolution embodying this agreement, however, was received by the secretary of the union, and the department is accordingly proceeding with the reference of the question to the Industrial Court.TEXTILES.Hosiery. A special meeting of the Industrial Council was held in Leicester, on the 10th March, to consider the position arising as the result of the ballot on the proposed reduction of bonus. Of the 35,500 workers to whom ballot papers had been sent, 2,358 had voted for a reduction and 23,032 against the reduction. The employers proposed that the question of reduction should be reconsidered at a meeting in April, and, in order that they might not be accused of a breach of faith, all wages paid in the week commencing the 25th April should be subject to a bonus of 100 per cent. The workers intimated that they could not recommend the proposal to their constituents, and they submitted a counter-proposal that a sliding scale, based on the cost of living, should be adopted. They were prepared to regard the present bonus of Is. 3d. on each Is. of the basic wage as equi-valent to a sliding scale bonus of 150 per cent., and proposed that the bonus of Is. 3d. should be reduced by Id. for every 10 points reduction in the cost of living. The employers stated that they were anxious to preserve the authority of the Council, and were accord-ingly prepared to recommend the sliding scale proposal to their members, subject to a modification that the first reduction of Id. should take place when the cost-of-living index number reached 145 per cent., and that the second reduction should not take place until the index number reached 130 per cent. ; and that thereafter Id. should be deducted for every 10 points decrease. This amendment was accepted by the operatives&apos; side, and the employers agreed to recommend the proposal to their constituent asso-ciations for approval.Hosiery Workers (Scotland). The National Union of General Workers have reported to the department that the Glen Glove and Hosiery Co., Ltd., Aberdeen, have refused to observe Award No. 422 of the Industrial Court, and have notified a substantial reduction in piece-work rates, involving a reduction of about 10s. a week. The Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to arrange a conference of representatives of the union and of the firm. It is understood that the firm is not a member of the West of Scotland Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association.MINING.China Clay. The main provisions of a wages agreement made by the Industrial Council on the 27th January are as follows : Time-workers are to be paid Is. Qd. per hour, for a 42-hour week ; half payment to be made for wet time. Overtime to be paid at the rate of time-and-a-quarter on week days, and time-and-a-half on Sunday.Piece-workers are to receive an equivalent increase of 20 per cent, on the piece-work rates existing on the 23rd August, 1920.   Boys are to get a proportional increase. The agreement is to continue in force until the 30th June, 1921.PRINTING AND PAPER.Tin Printing (Neath).-A. dispute is in progress between members of the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers and the Tin Plate Decorating Co., Ltd., Neath. The firm have refused to pay the rate of wages agreed to by the Tin Box Manufacturers&apos; Federation, to which they are said to be affiliated. Ten men have in consequence been on strike for over a month, and the union has now asked for the assistance of the Ministry.Printing Ink Makers. In an agreement dated the 16th March, 1919, a settlement was reached as to minimum rates and working conditions.  A revised agreement was signed
on the 6th May, 1920, and, in November, 1920, the union requested further revision. The employers refused this request and the difference was referred to the Industrial Court.The Court, after considering the movements of the cost-of-living index-number and the condition of the industry, awarded an advance of 5s. per week to male adult workers specified in Grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the agreement, and recommended that the parties should reconsider the rates for women, girls, youths and boys with a view to proper adjustment,   (Award No. 625.)PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Gas. The National Council held their second annual meeting on the 9th March. Progress as regards zoning and grading was reported in the South-Western, Midland, London, Southern and South Wales regions, as well as a settlement in the Eastern region, in which a deadlock had previously occurred. The formation of a new Regional Council for the North Wales District was reported.GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.Lighthouse Keepers. A constitution for a Whitley Council for the Irish Lighthouse Service has now been approved by the parties concerned and by the Board of Trade. Negotiations have also been proceeding for some time with respect to a proposed Council for the Scottish Service. The Trinity House Whitley Council, England and Wales, have been in existence for nearly twelve months, and in December considered certain claims of the light keepers on questions of remuneration, hours of work, and other conditions of employment. The keepers, however, were dissatisfied with the results of these negotiations, and the Workers&apos; Union, who work in close touch with the English Lighthouse Keepers&apos; Association, applied to the Ministry for arbitration. The Board of Trade and the Corporation of Trinity House, however, claim that the light keepers, having accepted the constitution of the Whitley Council, should act in accordance with the constitution of that body, which provides that in the event of disagreement the claim be referred to the Board of Trade, for submission to the Civil Service Arbitration Board, or such other body as may be agreed upon by the Board of Trade and the Council. The Workers&apos; Union, therefore, have been informed accordingly, and are understood to be taking up the matter again with the Whitley Council.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Glove Making.-The Unemployment Insurance Sub-Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 7th March, to discuss the possibility of setting up a special scheme under the Act. It was agreed that, having regard to the increase in benefits, it would be more advantageous for the workers to remain under the Act.Barmen (Hull). A strike of barmen in the Hull district is threatened in connection with a demand for certain minimum rates. The Hull Trades and Labour Council are stated to have promised their support, and, possibly, employees in the brewing industry may be affected if a strike takes place. The claim has been considered by the employers, and a resolution sent to the union intimating that, in view of the proposed Trade Board, they decline, at the present time, to enter into any arrangement with the union to fix a standard rate.Efforts are being made, however, to arrange a meeting of the employers to consider the desirability of a conference with a deputation from the union, with a representative of the department present.Waste Paper Workers (London). A resumption of work at the works of Messrs. Lendrum, Ltd., took place on the 7th March, on the understanding that payment of the rates formerly in force should continue for one week, pending a conference of the parties concerned. A meeting was arranged and an agreement reached whereby male workers should receive 70s. per week, and female workers 36s. per week, as from the 14th March, the agreement to operate until the 1st July. In the event of any alteration, a week&apos;s notice on either side is to be given.Church and Mission Keepers. The National Union of General Workers have recently approached the department with a request that a Joint Industrial Council should be set up to cover Church, Chapel and Mission keepers. The National Association of Church and Mission Keepers have been in existence for about two years and have recently
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Aerated Waters Trade Board (Scotland).-&apos;^ Administrative Committee considered a report from the Ministry, relating to the conditions obtaining in the industry in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and resolved to recommend the Board to propose a reduction of Id. per hour in the general minimum time rates for male and female workers in these islands.Brush and Broom Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to defer consideration of the question of fixing and varying minimum rates of wages as set out in their Notice ofamalgamated with the National Union of General Workers. As however, there is not sufficient prima facie evidence of organisation on either side for the purpose, or of the suitability of this occupation for an Industrial Council, the union have been officially notified that it is not at present considered practicable for the department to take any steps in the matter.Asbestos. The annual meeting of the Industrial Council was held at Manchester, on the 9th March. Under the sliding scale, arrangements for a reduction of \d. per hour were sanctioned for male workers and \d. per hour for females. The letter on short time from the Minister of Labour was read. In view of the fact that it is customary to limit discharges as far as possible it was decided to take no action.Seed Crushing and Compound Cake Manufacturing. The Industrial Council met on the 8th March. Two secretaries and an executive committee of three a side were appointed. An agreement was arrived at that present wages should continue until the end of June, and the executive committee were authorised to prepare proposals for standardisation to come into effect thereafter.It was resolved to form five District Councils and the executive committee were instructed to prepare a scheme for submission to the Council.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Workers. The strike of officials in the service of the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., continues. The corporation and the guild have sent individual statements to the Ministry in respect of each dismissal in which the guild alleges victimisation.GENERAL.Enforceability of an Award of the Industrial Court. A firm, who are members of an employers&apos; association party to an award of the Industrial Court, failed to comply with the award, and a question arose as to whether a worker could recover from the firm, by proceedings in an appropriate court of law, the increase granted by the award. The point was referred to the Solicitor, who states as follows : I am of opinion that, unless the worker and employer have agreed expressly or implicdly for good consideration that one of the terms of the contract of service between them shall be that the employer shall pay wages to the worker in accordance with an award of the Industrial Court, the answer to the question is in the negative. Whether the worker and employer in a particular case have entered into such an agreement would depend on all the circumstances of the case. The fact that the employer and worker are parties to a reference to the Industrial Court does not of itself make the award of the Industrial Court legally binding upon them, but it may be that an agreement to pay wages in accordance with an award is to be implied from the circumstances in which the parties agreed to refer a matter. Each case must be considered upon its own merits, and no answer of general application can, I think, be given to the question asked.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 273 to 276.]
General Department-continued,Proposal, dated the 18th October,* and to postpone consideration of the question of fixing and varying the minimum rates as set out in their Notice of Proposal dated the 31st Januaryf for a period of at least two months, on the understanding that the position of the representatives of the workers should not be prejudiced by any fall which might occur in the cost of living in the meanwhile.The Board agreed to fix and vary minimum rates of wages, in accordance with their Notices of Proposal dated the 17th and 23rd November.JIt was agreed that a letter which had been received suggesting a reduction in the general minimum piece-rates for female workers, employed on the drawing of textile brushes, should form the subject of an informal conference between the representatives of employers and workers.General Waste Materials Reclamation Trade Board (Great Britain).-T\\e Board con-sidered the objections &apos;odged against the Proposal, dated the 3rd january to fix minimum rates for female workers, and resolved to fix the minimum rates in accordance with the terms of the Proposal and to recommend that they become effective on the 18th April.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board considered a letter from the Minister stating that he proposed to make an Order confirming the rates fixed by the Board at their previous meeting, with the exception of certain rates which he was precluded from confirming by reason of their being a substantial departure from the proposals of the Board. After prolonged conferences between the appointed members and the sides, it was resolved to propose fresh rates for workers in boroughs and urban districts, with a population of less than 10,000 but not less than 5,000, which, at adult ages, would be slightly in excess of those as fixed by the Board for Scale A ; rates for male shop assistants and porters, of 16 and under 17 years of age, in Scales A, B and 0, at Is. less than those originally proposed for these workers I j; and in Scale A, for male and female porters and female shop assistants, of 22 years of age and upwards, identical rates with those proposed in the Notices for these workers of 21 years and under 22 years of age, and for male shop assistants, of 23 years of age and upwards, identical rates with those proposed for these workers of 22 and under 23 years of age.^fThe Board further resolved to fix, without alteration, the minimum rates for clerks and cash-desk workers as proposed in their Notice of the 7th December.* *Hat, Cap and Millinery Trade Board (England and Wales). The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Ministry asking the Trade BoarcPs observations as to whether workers employed in the covering of cork helmets with cloth could be included within the cloth hat and cap branch of the trade, and agreed to reply that such workers would not be included.Ostrich and Fancy Feather and Artificial Flower Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to fix a minimum time-rate for female workers, 18 years of age and over, of Sd. per hour, and a piece-work basis time-rate of 9d. per hour for all female workers.Perambulator and Invalid Carriage Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered a motion to reduce the minimum rates for male and female workers by I2h per cent., excepting certain of the minimum rates fixed for female workers. They resolved to defer consideration of the matter until experience is gained of the effects of the minimum rates, recently varied and fixed, during the season when trade normally revives.Tobacco Trade Board (Great Britain). The Cigar Committee resumed consideration of minimum rates of wages to be recommended by them to apply to apprentices in the cigar section of the trade, and after discussion resolved to submit fresh proposals which include provision for differential rates for apprentices employed in the London area and in the Provinces.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Rope, Twine and Net Trade Board (Ireland).-Pat Minister has made an Order, dated the 7th February, confirming the general minimum time-rates fixed for certain classes of* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 18, 30th October, p. 517. t See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 7, 12th February, p. 162.% See this Report, Vol. II, No. 22, 27th November, p. 616, and Vol. II, No. 23, 4th December, p. 641. $ See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 3, 15th January, p. 56.

General Department-continued.female workers, and has specified the 11th February as the date from which these rates are effective.The general minimum time-rates fixed for female workers, 18 years of age and over, employed on certain specified operations within the area of the County Borough of Belfast, range from tyd. to 8f(/. per hour, and, for those employed in all other districts, from 5 rf. to 8frl. per hour, according to the particular operation. The general minimum time-rate for all other female workers, 18 years of age and over, excluding learners of 18 years of age and over with less than twelve months&apos; experience in any branch of the trade, within the area of Belfast, is Id. per hour and, in all other districts, 6 cl, per hour.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland). The Minister has made an Order, dated the 3rd March, confirming minimum rates of wages for certain classes of male workers, and has specified the 28th March as the date from which these rates shall become effective.For male workers, who have completed four years&apos; apprenticeship or learnership in the trade, and who arc employed in areas administered by Rural District Councils or in areas with a population not exceeding 2,000, administered by Urban District Councils or other local authorities, the general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates are Is. 5c/. and Is.

A further slackening of industrial activity is reflected in the reports. While the rapid increase in unemployment in the iron and steel trades would appear for the moment to have been arrested, the position in the coal mining industry is becoming worse ; particularly is this the case in the South Wales district, where some collieries are now entirely closed down and, in others, large numbers of miners are working short time.Shipbuilding and Allied Industries--The outlook on the Clyde is no brighter and the number of skilled men discharged grows week by week. / On the Tyne, Tees and Wear, also, unemployment is increasing. In these areas the joiners&apos; strike is having serious effect; at Sunderland the ironworkers are idle because their work cannot proceed until(b 17112T) 2 O
the joiners&apos; work is advanced. On the Mersey, a number of small jobs are being carried on, but repair work is generally slack and the future outlook is regarded as far from favourable. In South Wales there is a slight improvement at Bute Docks and Newport, but at Barry and Swansea, the position is unaltered. At Southampton, owing to the uncertainty of the labour situation, employers are finding it impossible to accept new contracts, with the result that a number of large repair jobs are being diverted to the Continent.Textiles and Hosiery. A very pessimistic view is now taken of the position in regard to the cotton trade, owing to the prolonged period of slackness and to the continued delay of the trade revival which was predicted at the beginning of the year. There is, also, a lack of confidence in the stability of current prices for cotton goods, and this factor largely explains the continued absence of buyers.In the woollen industry extensive short-time working is still in operation, and, although at Wakefield several firms have commenced working longer hours, there is, unfortunately, no indication that this improvement is likely to become general.The report from Leicester indicates a further slight recovery in the hosiery trade; many local firms have increased the working hours of their short-time arrangements and others have been able to resume full-time working. The general opinion in this trade is that matters are beginning to look brighter, although no immediate return to normal conditions can be looked for.Miscellaneous Trades. The position of the boot and shoe trade is unchanged. Some firms have sufficient orders to keep their factories going, but this is not general and, in consequence, the number of unemployed and under-employed workpeople remains about the same.Short-time is increasing in the hollow-ware, chain and anchor, and edge tool trades in the West Midlands Division. On the other hand, the position of the pottery trade remains good. No change is to be recorded in the position of the brass, steel tube, screw and bolt trades in this area, which still remain depressed.Agriculture and Fisheries. In the fishing industry the number of trawlers laid up owing to the unremunerative price of fish steadily grows. At Grimsby the number has increased to 70, and this total will be further increased as a result of the decision of trawler-owners to lay up 30 per cent, of the fleet. A similar decision has been arrived at by the trawler owners at Milford Haven.In the Metropolitan area, the shortage of bricklayers and plasterers is still preventing the employment of less skilled men in the building trade. The decorating trade continues to improve, but the position for the period of the year is far from normal. It has, however, been possible during the week to find employment for a number of painters&apos; labourers, who have been unemployed for a considerable time. The demand for carpenters has now ceased.Transport. On the Clyde, more dockers have been employed as the result of the arrival of several cargo boats. At Leith transport work is quiet, but several grain cargoes are reported to be due and this will ease the situation. On the Mersey the position during the week has been very slack, and 490 fewer men were employed than in the previous week. At Avonmouth the number of dockers claiming unemployment insurance benefit has increased to 550, and, although a few ships are expected during the course of the next few days, it is not expected that the position will materially change for the better. At Grimsby the reduction of the fishing fleet is seriously affecting large numbers of men engaged in unloading fish.Labour Reductions.-Qh.dmd.oid report a further discharge of approximately 170 workpeople by the Hoffman Manufacturing Co., Ltd.At Norwich the Salt Union, Ltd., have closed down another of their works, affecting&apos; about 50 men ; and 150 men have been suspended by the United Alkali Co., Ltd., Fleet-wood.At Dunston-on-Tyne the Team By-Product Coke Co., Ltd., have paid off 130 semi-skilled workers ; and, at Cleator Moor,&quot; 330 men are affected by the closing down of the works of the Beckermet Mining Co., Ltd.Women&apos;s Employment.General Situation-There is still no indication of the hoped-for improvement in the general industrial situation.
LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Unemployment. The Canning Town Committee recommend that the Unemployment Grants Committee should subsidise training schools for young women wishing to enter domestic service, and should provide a fund to equip the girls when trained.. Unemployment Insurance. On the 8th March a letter was issued to all chairmen of Local Employment Committees enclosing a memorandum on the functions of the com-mittees under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921. The letter laid stress on the importance of securing the active co-operation of the committees. The St. Albans Women&apos;s Sub-Committee protest against the new rates of benefit, as tending to create unwillingness to work. The West Somerset Committee recommend that all insurable workpeople should be able to claim a refund of contributions on becoming incapable of work after they have paid for five years.General.--The Parkhead (Glasgow) Committee state that they will not accept respon-sibility for what may happen if the chronic state of congestion which at present exists at the Exchange is not immediately relieved by the provision of new premises. The Farnworth committee recommend increased pensions for disabled men.(b 17112T) 2 0 2Local Reports. In Lancashire the depression in the cotton trade is increasing. Many firms are closing down entirely or extending the period during which short time is worked. Employers state that the outlook is in no way encouraging, and that there is little hope of employment for the applicants on the registers of the Exchanges. Other trades in the North-Western Division continue slack; the paper and printing trade is depressed, there is no improvement in the shoe and slipper industry, and at Middleton discharges of women in the fruit-preserving industry are imminent.The general situation in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division is unchanged, and serious depression continues in the staple textile industries. At Bradford and Brig-house textile operatives are unemployed, and there is no improvement in the general position. At Dewsbury cleaners, dyers, textile operatives, rug makers, rag sorters and wholesale clothing machinists are out of work. Nearly 1,000 fresh unemployment insurance claims have been received. Similar reports are received from the other large textile centres. The lace trade continues to show severe depression, as does also hosiery and wholesale clothing.Severe depression continues in the wholesale clothing trade in Leeds, and the silver and cutlery trades are slack in Sheffield.No general improvement is reported from the South Midlands and Eastern Division, where the staple industries remain very depressed. A slight improvement in the wholesale clothing trade is reported from both Colchester and Kettering. Leicester state that there is little improvement in boot manufacture and hosiery.The West Midlands Division report increasing unemployment in all metal trades and in other industries of the district. In Birmingham unemployment and short time are increasing rapidly.At Coventry the live register is increasing. Slackness in the motor and cycle trades is reported from Sparkhill, and from Smethwick in the brass and steel industries. Throughout the division metal machinists and other workers in the metal trades are unemployed.Unemployment in London remains serious and general increases are notified on the live registers of all the larger Exchanges. Over 4,000 workers are on the register at Whitechapel, of whom over 1,400 are tailoresses.In the South-Western Division the clothing trades generally are slack, and there is considerable short time and unemployment amongst shirt and collar machinists, tailoresses, boot operatives, shirt makers, corset machinists and glovers.In Wales there would appear to be some increase in unemployment and, in the tinplate centres, a number of women are unemployed or on short time.In Scotland there is continued depression in the textile and in the printing and rubber trades.The general situation is unchanged in the Northern Division. Kendal report that seasonal employers are finding less difficulty in filling their vacancies, as local workers are accepting this employment, but steps are being taken to supply the demand from other centres as the season advances.
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 4th March the Appointments Department placed 408 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 51,360. Of these, 6,891 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 867 ex-Service men and 33 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 4th March was 11,463 ex-Service men and 1,208 civilians. At the same date 879 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 413 having been registered during the week.Reports from Districts-The Director at Leeds reports that there has been a slight increase in the number of placings. Vacancies are few, but continue to be of a remarkably good quality,OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Dona&apos;ion. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 3rd March, show 306,136 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  271,633 11s. Sd.Unemployment Insurance Benefit, The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 25th February was 949,003, involving an amount of  475,517 17s. lOd.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 8th March, 24,476 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 272,017 disabled ex-Service men.The report from Wales indicates that the placing of disabled men has been less satis-factory than during last month, and the live register has increased at practically every Exchange in the division. It is feared that few vacancies can be expected while the present trade depression lasts.JUVENILE BRANCH.Domestic Service. The reluctance of girls in the Walthamstow area to take up training in domestic subjects is marked. Acting on the suggestion of the Local Employ-merit Committee, the Juvenile Advisory Committee recently decided to ask those applicants who appeared suitable whether they would be prepared to attend classes of instruction in domestic subjects. Of the 250 girls asked, only two expressed their willingness to accept domestic work, and these stipulated that it must be daily work. It was finally decided that a suitable poster should be exhibited in the girls&apos; waiting room, drawing attention to domestic vacancies, and that the names of applicants willing to take a course of training should be recorded.Trade Board Rates (Reading). Difficulties have arisen in Reading in connection with the operation of Trade Board rates, especially in the clothing trade. A meeting of the local branch of the National Alliance of Employers and Employed was recently held to discuss this question, and the Juvenile Employment Officer was invited to attend. After a full discussion, a resolution was passed suggesting the adoption of an uniform rate, at commencement, for all learners who enter the trade between the ages of 14 and 18, Avages to rise more rapidly in the cases of the older entrants. The resolution has been sent to all branches of the Alliance.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 277, 278 and 280.]
The Director at Manchester reports that there has been an improvement in the number of placings. The Liverpool and Manchester evening papers have agreed to supply the department with copies of their first editions as soon as they start printing. Information of vacancies may thus be obtained at least an hour before the papers are on sale to the public.BUSINESS  AND  PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 4th March, the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 15 officers or men of similar educational qualifications, of which 10 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,154 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,510 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,809 applications, of which 23,306 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,185 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,350 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 4th March the Appointments Department received 137 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 2,672, of which 701 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 579 cases. At the same date 314 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 58 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 1,117 cases, in 481 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government depart-ments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 298 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 122 are still in training and 104 are awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT.INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics-Ow the 8th March, 24,798 men were in training, as against 24,822 on the 1st March, and 25,135 on the 8th February. During the week 299 men were placed in training. There were 16,418 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 1st March and the 8th February being 16,160 and 16,157 respectively. The Irish figures now account for nearly 25 per cent, of the waiting list, and are constantly increasing. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 27,543, the totals for the 1st March and the 8th February being 27,220 and 25,554 respectively.An inquiry has been made in one of the divisions into post-training careers and has produced replies from just over 1,000 men. Immediately after training, only 2*5 per cent, were returned as sick: and some time later, the proportion was still under 3 per cent. Having regard to the fact that disabled men only are concerned, this low pro-portion suggests that, on the physical side, the training given has proved beneficial, and, at any rate, has imposed no undue strain.Investigations. In view of the present difficulty of placing men in training for certain main industries, a great deal of attention is being paid to the question of obtaining new industrial openings. In the London area it would appear that a good number of men could be employed with advantage in perambulator and side-car manufacture, and a scheme is being prepared which, if approved, will be carried out at the Camden Town Factory. In Devonshire a hand-loom weaving scheme is under consideration, in which from 10 to 12 badly disabled men could be trained and employed. In Scotland, among the new openings that have been suggested may be mentioned fishing tackle manufacture, and flax scutching.Government Instructional Factories. The opening ceremony at the new factory at Belfast was performed by the Lord Lieutenant on the 2nd March. A large number of employers and trade union officials were present. His Excellency also made a tour of the factory, where there are now 184 men in training, and inspected the classes in boot and shoe repairing, hair-dressing, plumbing, tailoring, watch and clock repairing, and various processes of the vehicle building trade,
National Trade Advisory Committees: Electricity, Power and Light, A meeting was held at St. Ermins on the 4th March. Difficulties in connection with training at conva-lescent centres were discussed, and various misapprehensions removed. The Committee considered correspondence in regard to the action of the Electrical Trades Union in prohibiting the admission of further trainees, and it was felt that, while the greatest possible caution should be taken in admitting further men for training, owing to the present state of trade, it would be extremely unwise totally to prohibit the admission of any further men, even under existing circumstances, as there might quite well be local conditions which would fully justify a Local Technical Advisory Committee in accepting men for special classes of work in which there is a reasonable certainty that the men can be placed. It was also felt that this was really the intention of the union executive, and the secretary was instructed to communicate with them, suggesting that their instructions to their branches should be revised on these lines.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 9th March agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,900 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,823 apprentices, employed by 7,438 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 20,373.Wages. In connection with the firm of Messrs. J. Marshall &amp; Sons, Long Eaton, levers lace manufacturers, the question of the application of the settlement for this section of the trade, where an apprentice works single-handed on a machine, has again been raised. The operatives&apos; secretary has agreed that it would be fair to all parties if the employer paid the apprentice the whole, or even seven-eighths, of the actual earnings of the machine, the State supplementing this by \\d. in the shilling.Applications. A review of the &quot; unmated &quot; applications in the London and South-Eastern area has shown that, in several cases, the apprentices are at present employed on unskilled work, and are not willing to sacrifice their present wages to take advantage of the training provided : moreover, the maintenance allowance is not considered to be adequate. In certain other cases, where apprentices have not kept in touch with the Employment Exchange, it is thought that they have found employment as skilled men in their trade, or have gone into other employment.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. Further developments are reported in connection with the controversy between the Corporation and the master plumbers of Aberdeen. At a Council meeting during the week, an attempt was made to pass a motion rescinding the resolution not to contract with any employer who has not accepted the scheme, but without success ; ultimately, it was agreed that the Housing Committee of the Council should confer with the Ministry of Health on the subject.Non-Observance of Conditions. The South-Western area report that requests are continually being made by the trade unions for the department to induce employers of the working master type to observe the conditions laid down in the scheme. Such cases are difficult to deal with, partly because of the absence of records of wages paid to the apprentice. The trade union side generally give the question of wages every attention, but do not always attach importance to the training actually clue to the apprentice.Unemployment. The recent closing down of the Whiteheacl Torpedo Works, Wey-mouth, has involved 100 apprentices, of whom, however, only a few are under the scheme. The training they have received, both in the works school and at the Weymouth Engi-engineering School, has been in general engineering: they are not torpedo specialists, but have been engaged upon work mainly for steam locomotives. The supervisor in the firm has personally requested the help of the department in giving publicity to their case, with a view to absorption by other firms. In the meantime, efforts are being made to arrange for institutional training.General Training.Apprenticeship : Building. At West Bromwich, on the 18th February, the employers and operatives met and decided to set up an apprenticeship committee. Steps are being taken in conjunction with the Organising Officer for Juveniles to start the committee on the right lines. A separate committee will be set up for Warwick, though both sides will attend a meeting covering both Warwick and Leamington.  A joint committee in
accordance with the scheme has been agreed upon at Kenilworth, where a meeting is to be held on the 8th March to complete the constitution.A joint meeting of three representatives of the West Cumberland employers and three delegates of the operatives&apos; district council was held on the 22nd February at Workington. It was unanimously agreed to recommend the formation of apprenticeship committees throughout the area. The meeting was conspicuous for the goodwill shown on both sides.A meeting of Newcastle employers, who refuse to meet the operatives before the scheme has been explained to them, has been specially arranged for the 21st April. The Darlington employers will meet on the 22nd March, and the Cleveland employers on the 23rd. In the Cleveland district the operatives have asked that the scheme be explained to them, and are at present waiting for the date to be fixed.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments mil also be found on pages 285 and 286.]
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS  IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested; Instructional Factories.Major Glyn asked the Minister of Labour whether considerable difficulty is experienced in finding improvers&apos; vacancies for disabled men who have been trained in the Government instructional factories : and whether, under these circumstances, he will consider furnishing to Members of Parliament in whose constituencies Government instructional factories are placed a list of trainees from time to time who are seeking improvers&apos; vacancies, with a view to such Members of Parliament assisting to find them places.Dr. Macnamara: It is unfortunately true that on account of the present state of employment great difficulty is being experienced at the present moment in finding improvership vacancies for disabled ex-Service men who have been trained in the Govern-ment instructional factories, and I shall be only too glad to forward to any Members who are willing to help in this way a list of men in their constituencies for whom no vacancies can be found. (9th March.)
