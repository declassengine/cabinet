1 I *PjRT   11* GENERAL BTT^I.T,IG^CE.551TANGANYIKA TERRITORY *SIR HORACE BYATT, the Governor, arrived at KIGOMA, (on tho East side of LAKE TANGANYIKA) on the 20th March, to take over tho portions cf the cx-GHRMAN Fv 3? AFRICA hitherto administered by the BELGIANS which falls within the BRITISH mandatory area.The BELGIAN flag was formally lowered at 2 o!clock on tho afternoon of the 22nd, the BRITISH flag being then hoisted in its place *PJj R S I A.Tho attitude of tho Bolsheviks has changed with regard to PERSIA, annarontly as a result of tho RUSSO-PERSIAN agreement. It is reported that the YA1OT TURCOMANS have been advised by the Bolsheviks to coaso fighting the PERSIAN gendarmerie, as ,.,thoy cannot assist in any anti-PERSIAN Movement owing to the agreement.The SOUTH PERSIA Rifles have been dissolved and reformed under tho title of gendarmerie.   This has boon done in order to provont S0VIP3T-RUSSIA accusing tho PERSIAN Government of forming a regiment undor BRITISH officers.R U S S I A.tireless Mews reports that a communique has been issued by the Goman Government as followsfiA provisional protocol for tho development and stabilisation o? relations already existing between Germany and Russia was signed on 18th February, 1921, at Moscow&quot;.Available water transport on inland waterways has decreased by 50X sinoe 1914,   Disorganisation is still prevalent and tho Commissary for transport states that no special hopes should bo entertained as to material improvement,   The first step necessary is to iiunrove telephone and telegraphio coinnunioat ion,Trans^caspia.There is little change in the Russian Turkestan Situation. In Bokhara, Ferghana and Khiva fighting continues, and Bolsheviks have consequently had to increase &quot;garrisons in most towns1 by reducing forces on Trans-Caspian frontier.   By 16th ?-5arch two to throe thousand troops had been sent back to Krasnovodak from Baku,LITHUANIA.As result of a hostile demonstration by Polos at Vilna against Colonel Chardigny on 30th March, it is intended to transfer Headquarters of&apos;League of Nations Control Commission from Vilna to Kovno on 2nd April.&quot;GERMANY.   &apos;The Easter holidays have passed fairly quietly except&apos; at Essen.   The tfilholnstrasse, Berlin, is barricaded with barbed wire and defended with Machine Guns.
-  552The Governor has requested a safe conduct to a neutral country for the Fx-Fnperor Karl, who returned to Hungary uninvited and in defiance of solemn undertakings given to /-ddral Rorthy and to the frviss Government,   The Swiss Government have agreed to allow him to return and the Austrian Government will allow him to pass through Austria.The Fx-Emperor Karl is still at Steinamangor (WesternGREECE,It is thought probable that M, Gounaris, having been reooivod in London, will now become President of tho Chamber. H. Calaloeropoulos will probably become Minister of Finance.Oroeic Operations.Gen. Nider (Greek) states that the moral of tho Greek troops is excellent, because thev have been told that this is the liB^ rjffousiva;   but that it&quot;will go to piooos if this isshown to bo falsa.The Greek offioial cornaimication of 28th March announced tho capture of Afium Karabis3ar, after considerable resistance. Adabasar and tho southern end of Karakeui defile were also occupied after sharp fighting.On 2nd April, it was still doubtful as to whether the Greeks had captured JUskishehr. although they had claimed to have done so.According to press reports, their transport has bocome disorganised^ and the Turks claim to have inflicted a heavy defeat upon them.C. in 0. Mediterranean, reports that it appears probable that the Greeks have sufferod a check, if&apos;not a reverse, in front of Bskishohr,The Military Governor, Lemnos, reports that the Greek military authorities are establishing a supply base at Tenedos.TURKFY,The Greek offensive, and consequent withdrawal of Grsek troops from the Constantinople Command, combined with the refusal of the French to feed Russian Refugees after 1st April, has placed Gen. Harington in a very difficult &quot;position.While the Greek offensive covers Constantinople from any direct attack by the Nationalists from the Fast, the town and populace have to be protected from acts of; brigandage by Nationalist marauders.On the ,/fost, there is the possibility of. an attack by starving Russian refugees, which might be assisted by the Constantinople Russians, of which there are some 60,000.Refugees.im-*v*% \The French Minister in Greece states that Grange1*8 forces are disarmed, except f^r a very small number, who act as police,   They are quiet and wall behaved, and, as French troops hold the nock of the Galliuoli Peninsular,, he considers the alarm on the part of the Greek Government unnecessary.
Gen. Charpy proposed to move tho Russians ftfom Chatalja to lemnos. in order that thoy may he further from Constantinople. It is believed that he has sufficient supplies to feed them until tho end of April., but that tho French Government aro anxious to rid themselves of tho whole question as early as possible.A resolution has been placed on tho table in the U.S. Senate proposing that the President be empowered to ascertain v/hother tho Government of the United Kingdom is willing to consider tho cession to the P.Si of all or any of its possessions in the //est Indies, including Bermuda, as a means of paying off hor war debt.
