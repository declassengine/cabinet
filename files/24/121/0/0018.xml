GENERAL.There is no sign of improvement in the industrial situation. The rapid increase in unemployment in the iron and steel industry appears to have been arrested, but the position in the coal-mining industry is becoming rapidly worse, and in South Wales many collieries are now entirely closed down, while large numbers of miners are working short-time. In Lancashire it is reported that the number of men who have registered for employment during the past week has been greater than in any previous week of this year. Pessimistic views are now taken of the position in the cotton trade owing to the continued delay in the expected trade revival. In the woollen industry several firms at Wakefield are now working longer hours, but there is no indication that any general improvement is taking place. A further slight recovery in the hosiery trade is reported from Leicester, and it is the general opinion that in this industry the outlook is somewhat brighter. In the boot and shoe trade the position is unchanged, and while some firms have sufficient work in hand to keep their factories going on full time others are unable to keep their workpeople fully employed. Short-time working is increasing in the metal trades in the Midlands, but the position in the pottery trade remains fair. Discharges of skilled men from the shipbuilding yards continue, and a large number of iron-workers are now idle. Unemployment remains fairly high among agricultural workers, and in the fishing industry the number of trawlers laid up owing to the unremunerative price of fish is steadily increasing. The shortage of skilled men in the building industry is still resulting in large numbers of unskilled building workers remaining unemployed, but the position with regard to painters and decorators has somewhat improved.II. EMERGENCY WORK.The Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the 19th October on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. He outlined schemes for employing a large number of fit ex-Service men in connection with the Housing Programme, on which negotiations with the trade unions were proceeding; and schemes for anticipating a four years&apos; programme for Arterial Roads in London and in the provinces; whilst at the same time pressing forward with the Ministry of Transports programme of road classification and maintenance grants.A further statement was made by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December, indicating that the further proposals of the Government included: a final endeavour to secure an agreement with the building trades for the admission of ex-Service men; a rapid extension of road construction schemes; the distribution by the Unemploy-ment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Yiscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting local authorities on relief schemes other than house building and road work; and the amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act (1920) in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople, who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit. It has since been agreed that the Unemployment Grants Committee shall also deal with schemes in respect of road work other than those undertaken by the Ministry of Transport. .[5911] - B 2

The restriction in regard to road work has since been removed.Works are approved only in areas where serious unemployment exists which is not otherwise provided for. Preference in employment is given to ex-Service men. Grants do not exceed 60 per cent, of the wages bill of additional unemployed men engaged, and the works undertaken are such as are approved by the-appropriate Government Departments as suitable works of public utility.Up to the 11th March 461 applications for grants had been sanctioned in respect of 152 Local Authorities.

SUMMARY OF LABOUR ENGAGED ON RELIEF SCHEMES.1. Schemes assisted by Government grants : Arterial Roads............... 18,733Expediting of lay-outs on housing schemes ...        ... 4,013Other Public works assisted by the unemployment grants Committee   ...        ...        ...    &apos;    ... 20,698Alternative work  at  War  Office  and  AdmiraltyEstablishments       ...        ...        ...        ... 8,757Adoption of short-time in War Office and AdmiraltyEstablishments       ...        ...        ...        ... 9,560Additional labour engaged by Office of Works (Emer-gency Programme)   ...        ...        ...        ... 2,2702. Public Works put in hand by Local Authorities without government grants  ...        ...        ...        ... 15,466Grand Total     79,497As the figures quoted represent the totals of the returns received froni only 220 Local Authorities (out of 291 who were asked to supply information) it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of 80,000.(The Ministry of Transport estimate that there are also some 20,000 men employed on road maintenance and repair work over and above those ordinarily so employed.)(10.) UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, brought the number of insured persons up from 4,000,000 to 12,000,000 and increased the rates of benefit to 15s. for men and 12s. for women. Benefit could be drawn for fifteen weeks in any insurance year. In order to meet the needs of newly insured workers the Act provided for the payment of eight weeks&apos; benefit as soon as four contributions had been paid. Owing to the amount of unemployment which existed at the time the Act commenced, this provision was found to be inadequate, and by a short Act, which came into operation on the 23rd December, 1920, payment of eight weeks&apos; benefit was authorised up to the 31st March, 1921, on evidence of employment during 1920 being furnished. Owing to the number of insured workers unemployed and exhausting their benefit and the additional fact that the out-of-work donation scheme under which upwards of 300,000 ex-Service men are drawing donations terminates on the 31st March the Unemployment Act, 1921, was passed through Parliament and became law on the 3rd March. Under the Act the rate of benefit is raised to 20s. for men and 16s. for women, while benefit may be drawn for sixteen weeks in each of two periods running from the 3rd March to the 2nd November, 1921, and from the 3rd November to the 2nd July, 1922; after the 2nd July, 1922, benefit may be drawn to the extent of twenty-six weeks in each insurance year. This benefit may be drawn irrespective of the payment of contributions provided applicants can show that they were employed in an insurable occupation in each of twenty weeks since 1919. In the case of ex-Service men the number of weeks employment required is ten only, and in
sappropriate cases the requirement may be waived altogether on the recommendation of the Local Employment Committee.The claims current on the 25th February were as follows : -	Men.	Boys.	Women.	Girls.	Total.Total unemployment   .. Short time	409,791 273,237	30,005 24,574	269,275 372,250	-32,818 50,668	741,889 720,729
