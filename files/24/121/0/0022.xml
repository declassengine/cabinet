HIS BRITAfiUlIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOTSRSQSBfiX) iB E 0 g 5 T* Co-jy No.CP.-2722,CABINET.gEgjAg  REPARATIONS*-Memorandum by First Commissioner of Works.Tho difficulty of finding a method,by which Germany can at once satisfy the claim of Great Britain without, . at the same time, injuring British Industries.,, are only too well known.      German imports, however checked by means of legislation, or otherwise cause direct competition with British industries, they diminish the volume of British employment in such industries and also tend to reduce prices to an unremunerative level to the manufacturers.     There e ..ists, however, in this as in all other countries, a demand for worKS and commodities which the purchasing power of the country is unable to afford, with the consequence that such demand remains unsatisfied.      If, therefore, a method, can be devised by which the German Government can transmit to the British Government commodities whioh otherwise we should have to do without, and the British Government can utilise these products for the benefit of the Nation without entering into competition with British industries, this would appear to give a method bp which the german Government can effect a useful payment of part of its debt.     To give an example of what is meant.      Various reports have been presented to the Board of Trade by an influential Committee set up to consider the water power resources of the country.     It would appear from these reports that there are ^reat possibilities of this country being supplied with cheap electric power - a subjeotof ..
of vital national importance - if these ochemes can he carried out.     The execution of these, however, requires large sums of capital for machinery, transmission lines, etc., which, in the present impoverished state of our capital resources are difficult to obtain.     The schemes remain, and are likely to remain, in abeyance.     How, if the German Government would provide, as a method of paying its debt, the machinery etc. required to carry out these schemes, which would enable them to be carried through at a very small capital cost, the following results would be obtained?-A large amount of emptoyraent would be given in this country for that part of the work which has to be carried out locally; extremely cheap (because of the low capitalisation), sources of power VvOuld be created which v;ould enable British indus-tries forever to compete on favourable terms in the markets of the world.As another instance, a somewhat similar problem arises with the electrification of railways.     In this instance again a high initial capital cost stands in the way of progress being made for many years to come, yet, the electrification of suitable portions of the railways by more economic working would enable railway charges to be diminished for the benefit of the whole community.    These are only two cases given as illustrations, and careful exploration on these lines would find many more. Free timber supply and cement for housing schemes are other methods that occur.The objection which is currently taken to a policy of this kind is that by the introduction of these ^oo&amp;s for nothing you are depriving British industry of employment.    But it isnecessary ...
necessary to point out that there is a fallacy involved in this line of reasoning.      The type of project which has been mentioned will not be carried out at all under present con-ditions.     There are no orders going- to British industry, and the demand, of course, remains dormant.    The fulfilment of such a demand by gratuitous goods is not a tteduotion from the activity of British industry.     On the other hand, it would be an addition to the wealth of the country and, indirectly, a benefit to the community.It may be argued that this method of obtaining reparation from Germany would impose an impossible burden on German finance, as, obviously, the German Government would have to pay its manufacturers for handing over their products for nothing.   But this objection is inherent to the payment of any indemnity, and as indemnities can only be paid either in gold or by foreign credits, or jvoods, and as obviously my proposals can only cover a relatively small propo;-- \ ion o: the total amount we are entitled to claim, it would pro tanta diminish the difficulty of the German Government in obtaining the fcweign credits or other means of exchange by which they can pay us, and it would tend to prevent that disturbance of our marketsi to remedy which we are now introducing legislation.If the argument which I present is sound, as I believe it is, I would like to suggest that a small committee of the president of the Board of Trade in conjunction with the Minister of Trans dort, should be set up at the earliest opportunity in order to investigate in greater detail the practical possibili-ties in working out these ideas.(Signed)     AIiJPBSD M0I1D.   ,OFFICE Off WORKS. 3.77. 15th March, 1921.
