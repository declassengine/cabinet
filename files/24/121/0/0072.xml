PART II-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Railway Shopmen. The Principal Assistant Secretary met informally, on the 17th March, representatives of the Negotiating Committee of General Managers, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, to discuss terms of reference.  A further meeting will be held shortly.Electrical Cable Making,-The Industrial Council met on the 16th March. The principal business was the question of enforcement by unions of agreed rates on manu-facturers who are not members of the Cable Makers&apos; Association. The unions outlined the steps which they were taking to bring non-federated firms into line.The attitude of the Admiralty and of the Post Office towards independent firms was criticised, and it was decided that, when the cable makers wished it, the National Union of General Workers would have a question put in the House of Commons on the attitude of these departments towards Industrial Council agreements.The Council decided to accept the decision of the Industrial Court that Hampshire should be in District No. 2.Caulkers (Barroiv-in-Fumess). The Industrial Court, sitting with assessors, decided that the term &quot; water-tested &quot; bulkheads, in a list compiled in 1897 at the works of Messrs. Vickers, Ltd., did not include hose-tested bulkheads. The decision was given without prejudice to the question whether the rates in the price-list for such work were adequate or not.   (Award No. 630.)Ship Joiners. The expediency of calling the parties in this dispute together has been discussed, and consideration has been given to the question of setting up a Court of Inquiry, in view of the extent to which public interest is now involved. It was decided that the views of the parties should be ascertained on the present position, and during the week the Minister had a private interview with representatives of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation.WOODWORKING AND FURNISHING.Vehicle Builders. A conference between the National Association of Vehicle Builders and the unions was held on the 15th March. After considerable discussion the employers made a final proposal that wages should be reduced by 2d. per hour, and that a sliding scale with an increase or decrease of Id. per hour for each rise or fall by 13 points in the cost of living, taking the standard at 160, should he brought into operation as from the 1st May. In view of the decisive ballot vote against the reduction of 3cL per hour, the unions, while agreeing to a sliding scale, insisted that the immediate reduction in wages should not be more than \\d. per hour. The conference broke up on the understanding that the unions would make a definite decision within 24 hours. The unions failed in this and, on the 16th March, telegraphed to the secretary of the employers&apos; association that further proposals would be submitted on the 19th March. They also suggested to the employers&apos; association that meantime the notices should be withdrawn.POTTERY AND GLASS.Pottery.-Tl\e Organisation Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 14th March. It was suggested that employers should endeavour to induce non-union workers to join the union, and that the union should consider the question of withdrawing workers , from an employer who refused to join the federation. It was eventually moved to support a previous recommendation of the committee which suggested that the Government should have power to issue a charter to industries having 75 per cent, of the employers and 75 per cent, of the workers organised in their respective associations, and that the Councils for those industries should be given statutory powers.
The Wages and Conditions Committee, on the 10th March, discussed an application by the National Union of Clerks for an increase in wages, and equal pay for men and women. The union Itad already submitted their application to the federation, who returned it with a request that it be reconsidered, and that a more reasonable and more practicable application should be submitted. The union then asked that the federation should suggest an alternative scale of wages. In reply the federation circulated among their members a scale which they recommended as a minimum. The union&apos;s suggested rates differed from the scales circulated by the federation to the extent of 22s. Qd. and 38s. Ihl., respectively, for men and women 21 years of age. It was agreed that the parties should meet and discuss the matter further.Glass Bottle Manufacturers (Charlton). Owing to the state of trade, the employers posted a notice on the 7th March, that certain increases granted to the engineering staff last September should cease forthwith. The union refused to regard the poster as a proper notice, as the men had already started work, and the men struck on the 10th March. At a conference arranged by the Chief Conciliation Officer, on the 15th March, the two sides failed to agree on terms of resumption. It was agreed that the firm should write to the union explaining, in detail, exactly how the reductions should operate, the letter to be considered by the union at a special meeting on the 16th March.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Bakers. The ballot of the operatives resulted in a large majority in favour of a national agreement, and the employers now regard a further meeting of the Joint Industrial Council as impossible. Apart from the present wages difficulty, however, recent developments should have weakened this view, and the Chief Conciliation Officer is endeavouring to influence the employers.Bakers (Hull). At the joint conference on the 10th March, it was admitted that an agreement, dated the 2nd August, 1920, had been signed on the understanding that the union&apos;s representative would use his influence with the workers to adopt night work. He eventually agreed to do this at a mass meeting which was being held on the 14th March. The meeting resolved that, on the reinstatement of the eight men who had been dismissed, the union would agree to discuss the question of night work with the employers. The eight men have now found employment and, at a further joint conference, the district secretary of the union promised to recommend the adoption of night work, at a branch meeting on the 18th March.IRON AND STEEL.Tinplate. The employers in the tinplate industry in South Wales are urging the associated craftsmen to accept payment according to the process workers&apos; sliding scale, or to submit to a reduction of special bonuses. Three meetings have been held without reaching any settlement.TEXTILES.Carpets. The Industrial Council met in London on the 17th March. The Scottish employers, who seceded in January, 1920, have now returned to the Council and were present at the meeting. The constitutions of District Councils for the areas of Kidder-minster, Yorkshire and Scotland were approved. The Council agreed to forward a letter to the District Councils recommending that in periods of trade depression, the work should be shared out among the operatives as far as possible.It was agreed that not more than two ordinary meetings of the National Council should be held annually.A revision of the wages agreement reached by the Council in January, 1920, was considered. The employers proposed that the sliding-scale agreement should be continued for nine months, but that, after the reduction consequent upon the fall of the cost-of-living jndex number below 145, no further reduction should take place until the figure reached 130, thus offering a 5 per cent, advantage as compared with the 15 per cent, for which the workers applied. The workers ultimately accepted the employers&apos; proposals. The effect will be that, as the cost-of-living index number for March was 141, wages will be reduced to 130 per cent, for time-workers, and 140 per cent, for piece-workers. No further reduction, however, will take place until the cost-of-living index number has fallen to 130, at which point further reductions of 10 per cent, will be effected.
PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply-The National Council met on the 18th March. A draft consti-tution for works committees was provisionally approved. A deputation from the South Coast Area District Council was heard, and a decision reached regarding a dispute at Bournemouth.The National Joint Board met on the 19th March. The question of continued repre-sentation upon the Board of the clerical and commercial staffs was again considered. It was decided to invite six representatives of the National Association of Local Govern-ment Officers to discuss the question of the representation of the clerical staffs of the municipal electricity undertakings at their next meeting on the 16th April. It was resolved that the sick leave clause in the conditions of employment of technical staffs should be reconsidered, and that the District Joint Boards and the District Interim Joint Committees should he asked to forward suggestions to the National Joint Board.The Industrial Court have fixed minimum rates of wages and working conditions for workers in the electricity supply industry in the East Coast Area, grading the towns in the area in three groups.   (Award No. 632.)Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (Scotland). The Council met on the 15th March and, although there was not a quorum on the employers&apos; side, proceeded to transact business. A report was made that a deputation had waited upon the Scottish County Councils&apos; Association, but that the association had decided not to join the Council. Definite steps were decided upon with a view to convening conferences of local authorities and trade unions concerned in six areas in order to consider proposals to establish Provincial Councils.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manned Workers (England and Wales).  A meeting of the Provincial Council for South Wales and Monmouthshire, on the 28th February, discussed the advance of 2d. per hour, as from the 1st January, recently made by a deputation from the National Council, acting as arbitrators after a deadlock had been reached on the Provincial Council. The employers&apos; side proposed that the operation of the advance should be deferred until the 1st May, when further consideration should be given to the wages position. Discussion was adjourned until the 14th March, when the proposal was withdrawn. Certain employers&apos; representatives expressed the view that local authorities should not reduce wages until reductions had taken place in privately owned industries in the area. It is understood that the employers&apos; side intend, at a later date, to give notice of an application for a reduction in wages.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Retail Co-operative Movement: Conciliation and Negotiating Machinery. Repre-sentatives of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers called to discuss this question on the 17th March. In the majority of the areas there are now District Hours and Wages Boards and a Central Wages Board, with which bodies the union can negotiate. The Boards are representative of the employers. They enable the union to deal with a central body rather than individual societies, but they have no value for conciliation purposes. In the Western Area there is no Central Wages Board and, in some counties, no District Boards. In the Northern Area, however, there has been superimposed on the ordinary Boards a Joint Council consisting of an equal number of representatives of both sides, which acts as a conciliating body. It is, at present, in an experimental stage, but the union representatives agreed that it is a marked advance.Apart from arbitration by single arbitrators or the Industrial Court disputes can be referred to a Joint Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the co-operators, but the union strongly object to arbitration by this body, chiefly on the ground that it is slow in working, and practically deprives them of the right to strike. In practice it is seldom used.It appears that in 1915 the union then the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers-and the Co-operative Union, Ltd., agreed to the establishment of a National Joint Conciliation Board, consisting of an equal number of representatives of co-operative societies and of the union, with an independent chairman, either agreed upon or appointed by the Board of Trade. District Conciliation Councils formed part of the&apos; scheme. Though this machinery has never been officially abandoned, to all intents and purposes it has ceased to exist. The union are anxious that a new scheme should be established, somewhat on the lines of a Joint Industrial Council but with a permanent independent chairman, preferably a lawyer.It is expected that negotiations on this question may be opened shortly after Easter.
435295 26.3.21.Co-operative Employees (Northern Area). The St, Anthony&apos;s and Walker Societies lodged appeals with the Joint Wages Council against the Northern Co-operative Agreement, and, as the Council failed to agree, the matter was referred back to the individual societies. The societies decided not to concede the full wage advance claimed under the agreement, and as a result the employees, who are members of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, have given a week&apos;s notice to cease work. About 55 employees are affected. It is understood that the union are not inclined to accept arbitration. The Chief Conciliation Officer is taking steps to avoid a stoppage.Co-operative Employees (Edinburgh)-A joint communication from the St. Cuthberfs Co-operative Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks has been forwarded, through the Chief Conciliation Officer, requesting the department to appoint an arbiter to settle a dispute on the question of the application of a schedule of wages proposed by the union. The society are not affiliated to the National Wages Board and were not a party to the national award for Scotland recently issued by Sheriff Fyfe. The Chief Conciliation Officer has obtained the consent of the parties to the case being referred to the Industrial Court, and the union would prefer that a single arbitrator should hear the case.Co-operative Employees (Deiby). A strike of 62 butchers in the employment of the Derby Co-operative Society, Ltd., took place on the 11th March, owing to the refusal of the society to operate an agreement reached by the Derby master butchers and the Derby branch of the Journeymen Butchers&apos; Federation of Great Britain, to which union the men belong, though they had previously been members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers. The dispute was acute ; the employers refused the wages demand but offered arbitration by the Joint Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operators. The union were agreeable to arbitration, but insisted that it must be through the Ministry of Labour. The employers opened a central store to dispose of the goods lying at the branches, and it was hinted that they intended to employ ex-soldiers and women to replace the strikers. The union were strengthened by the support given at a meeting of co-operators in the town and by the promise of help from some of the craft unions. A conference of the employers, attended by a representative of the department, was held on the night of the 15th March. The employers eventually consented to receive a deputation, on condition that the members came with a mandate to resume work on the 16th March, and to agree to the submission of the dispute to arbitration by the Joint Committee. The terms were accepted, under protest, by the employees&apos; representatives and work was resumed on the 16th March.Barmen (Hull). The Chief Conciliation Officer met a deputation of the employers at Hull on the 11th March. Discussion chiefly centred round the representation claimed by the union, and the proposal to establish a Trade Board for the public-house trade. The deputation decided to recommend that a joint meeting should be held, with a representative of the department present; a meeting of the licensed trades will shortly be held to consider the matter. The employers also asked to be furnished with the latest information as to the progress of the Trade Board. The Chief Conciliation Officer subsequently interviewed the divisional organiser of the Workers&apos; Union and persuaded him to use his influence to prevent the local representative taking hasty action.PROFESSIONAL WORKERS.Insurance Workers. In connection with the strike of insurance officials in the service of the General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation, Ltd., the Guild have now been informed that the Minister has come to the conclusion that he cannot secure a settlement by conciliation, and that the use of Part II of the Industrial Courts Act would not be appropriate.GENERAL.Association of Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Com-mittees. As a result of previous conferences, and the appointment of a Provisional Committee, a further conference was held at Montagu House on the 18th March. It was resolved to proceed to form an Association on the lines outlined by the Provisional Committee. The officers and a convening committee were thereupon elected. After much discussion, the following resolution was passed, by 21 votes to 5 : &quot; That this conference of Industrial Councils and Reconstruction Committees is strongly of opinion that legislation should at once be commenced by the Government to give the necessary power to the Ministry of Labour to make binding upon the whole of any industry any wages awards or agree-ments, or arrangements as to working hours and conditions, made by Joint Industrial Councils and Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees, if so requested by the Council or Committee concerned.&quot;
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS.PROCEEDINGS.Button-making Trade Board (Great Britain). The Special Committee met to reconsider the recommendation that no action be taken with regard to the minimum rates of wages applicable in respect of female workers, employed on swing-turning lathes, and that any question which may arise on the matter be left to the workers&apos; organisations and the employers. They agreed to advise the Board to adopt the recommendation. The committee also agreed to inform the Board that they are of opinion that it is impracticable to attempt to fix general minimum piece-rates for all male and female workers employed on swing-turning lathes.Chain Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board agreed to vary the minimum rates for the male section of the trade in accordance with the Notice of Proposal dated the 6th January, 1921.Grocery and Provisions Trade Board (Scotland). The Board had before them the objections lodged to their proposal to fix minimum rates for workers throughout the trade, and after prolonged discussion decided to appoint a committee to consider the question and to report to the Board.Linen and Cotton Handkerchief and Household Goods and IAnen Piece Goods Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board considered an application by the employers&apos; repre-sentatives for a reduction in the minimum rates for female workers. After considerable discussion the Board adjourned for a fortnight, in order that representations might be made to the Minister as to the extremely difficult position in which the trade and the Board found themselves as a result of the continued delay in minimum rates being put into operation in Ireland, and in order that the Minister might be asked to confirm, and put into operation forthwith, such minimum rates as had in fact been fixed by the Irish Board.Ostrich and Fancy Feather and Artificial Flower Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board resolved to issue Notice of Proposal to fix general minimum time-rates, piece-work basis time-rates and overtime rates for male and female workers. Male workers employed as dyers in the feather trade are, however, excluded from the provisions of the Proposal.Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board unanimously agreed to vary the minimum rates at present in operation for male and female workers in accordance, subject to a variation in the form of fixing the overtime rates, with their Notices of Proposal, both dated the 13th January, 1921. The Board also agreed to fix the special minimum piece-rates already proposed in respect of female workers, other than home-workers, employed by Messrs. Mares, Ltd., Basingstoke.The Board considered also a letter from the Ministry with regard to the revision of the Special Orders for the clothing trades and the scope of the clothing Trade Boards, and agreed to appoint three representatives from each side of the Board to attend the conference proposed by the Minister.A letter from the Ministry with regard to granting permits of exemption for limited periods to disabled ex-Service men was considered, and it was agreed to reply that itAt the afternoon session a draft voluntary scheme for supplementary unemployment benefit, submitted by a committee of employers, was discussed, and was referred to a sub-committee for consideration and further action, the opinion being expressed that the ideas of Councils on the subject should be sought.Mr. C. S. Myers, M.D., D.Sc, gave a lecture on &quot; Industrial Fatigue,&quot; which was followed by a general discussion. A resolution was passed requesting H.M. Treasury not to curtail the grant to the Industrial Fatigue Research Board.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 296 to 298, and 304.]
General Department-continued,was not usual for the Board to grant permits for such a short period as three months and that, where permits had been granted for this period, it had been with a view to giving temporary protection pending further investigation. While the Board were always willing to give sympathetic consideration to applications for permits by disabled ex-Service men, they must reserve their statutory right to deal with each case on its merits.The Board also considered a communication from the Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain) with regard to the position of home-workers under the Trade Boards Acts, suggesting that a conference of the clothing and cognate Trade Boards should be convened to consider this question. It was agreed that four representatives from each side of the Board should attend the proposed conference.The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the City of Cardiff Education Committee with regard to the effect of the Trade Board rates on apprentices in the sewing trades, and agreed to recommend a reply pointing out that the Board had paid regard to the question of the rates that should be applicable to learners, and that, in addition, provision had been made for a committee to explore the whole question of learnership in the trade. They also agreed to refer the question of co-operation between the Board and Juvenile Advisory Committees to the committee appointed to investigate the question of learnership in the trade.Rope, Twine mid Net Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee considered a letter from the Ministry, on the subject of the granting of permits of exemption for limited periods only, and agreed to reply that in order to avoid causing inconvenience to either employers or workers, the committee had been in the practice of issuing permits for as long a period as possible, but that where the information furnished was insufficient, the committee had been obliged to safeguard themselves by issuing permits for short periods pending investigation.A letter from the Ministry on the subject of the constitution of the employers&apos; side of the Board was considered, and it was agreed to reply that the committee were of opinion that adequate representation could be obtained by the Aberdeen Trawl Net Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Rope Manufacturers from Dundee and District, were the association to affiliate with, and the rope manufacturers to join, the Rope, Twine and Net Manufacturers&apos; Federation, and that, in any case, the employers&apos; representatives did not agree to the readjustment of representation as suggested in the Ministry&apos;s letter.Stamped or Pressed Metal Wares Trade Board (Great Britain).-Th.e Administrative Committee conferred with representatives from the Birmingham Juvenile Employment Committee with regard to the possibilities of co-operation between the Board and the latter committee. It was agreed that a copy of the list of employers in the trade should be forwarded to the secretary of the Juvenile Employment Committee to enable him to circularise these employers with regard to the conditions of employment of juvenile labour.FIXING AND VARIATION OF MINIMUM RATES OF WAGES.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 14th March, to vary and fix general minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates for female workers, 19 years of age and over, with not less than four years&apos; experience in the trade, employed as button-holers, finishers or machinists, other than machinists who do the whole machining on a garment.The rates proposed for female workers employed in areas administered by Rural District Councils and Urban District Councils or other local authorities, having a population not exceeding 2,000 at the last census, are a general minimum time-rate of lOd. per hour and a piece-work basis time-rate of lid. per hpur ; for those employed in areas other than those specified above, the general , minimum time-rate is IOJcZ. per hour, and the piece-work basis time-rate ll^d. per hour.The Board have also issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 14th March, to vary and fix general minimum time-rates for certain classes of male workers.The general minimum time-rate proposed for all male workers, 22 years of age and over, except apprentices and learners, cutters and trimmers, and workers who have completed four years&apos; appren-apprenticeship or learnership, is Is. 2d. per hour; lower rates are proposed for younger workers. General minimum time-rates are also proposed for male apprentices and learners.
General Department-continued.Ready-made and Wholesale Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Ireland). The Board have issued a Notice of Proposal, dated the 15th March, to vary and fix general minimum time-rates and overtime rates for male workers under 22 years of age.The general minimum time-rate proposed for all workers, other than learners, of 21 years and under 22 years of age, is ll^d. per hour; lower rates are proposed for workers under that age. Where, however, a worker commences employment in the trade at or over the age of 19, the rate proposed for the first six months of employment is 8d. per hour, and for the second six months Qd. per hour. The Board also propose overtime rates for male workers employed on time-work and piece-work, and for this &quot;purpose propose to declare the normal number of hours of work to be 48 in any week, 9 on any day other than Saturday, and 5 on Saturday.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on page 295.]EMPLOYMENT AND INSURANCE DEPARTMENT.EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGES.The Unemployment Position.The following table shows the work of the Exchanges in respect of registrations, vacancies and placings during the week ending the 11th March: --	Men.

There is little change to be recorded in the general industrial position. A further increase is reported in the live registers at the Employment Exchanges, but this is attributable to the re-registration of applicants entitled to a further period of benefit under the new Unemployment Insurance Act, rather than to a further serious decline in industrial activity.Iron and Steel. Employment is still unsatisfactory, and the immediate outlook cannot be regarded as favourable. Keports from Scotland record an extension of short-time working at Coatbridge, affecting 500 workpeople, and the paying off of 1,200 to 1,400 workmen employed in the steel rolling mills at Parkhead. On the other hand, the Lanarkshire Steel Co., Ltd., Motherwell, are resuming work this week; it is expected that 120 men will be placed on full time and a further 500 on short time. At Middlesbrough the majority of iron and steel workers are on day-to-day engagements and at Consett four out of seven of the iron rolling mills have closed down. A slight improvement is reported from Cleator Moor, where a furnace employing about 300 men has been relighted; and, at South Bank, 100 men have been restarted at the Ormesby rolling mill.In the Sheffield district the position is regarded as growing worse week by week, and it is expected that there will be a general closing down of the works for an extended holiday at Easter.Shipbuilding and Allied Trades.-On the Clyde a large number of riveters, platers, caulkers and helpers have been added to the registers owing to the completion of contracts. Very little new work is coming to the yards, as, with the high cost of production and the
continuance of the joiners&apos; strike, employers are not disposed to enter into new contracts. At Leith a large repair job has come to one of the yards. As regards the Tyne, Tees and Wear, the only improvement to be recorded is at Hartlepool, where 100 additional men, chiefly riveters and helpers, have been employed on repair work. The Mersey ship-repairing works have been taking on labour during the week, but the work is quite casual, and the men are only engaged for short periods. In South Wales the position is practically unchanged, although at Newport the number of skilled workers employed on repair work has slightly increased during the week. At Barnstaple shipbuilding is brisk, and there is sufficient work on hand to provide full-time employment for several months.Textiles and Clothing. Reports from centres engaged in the cotton trade are again depressing, and afford no ground for expecting any improvement in the near future. Short-time working is still the pronounced feature of the wool textile industry. A slight improve-ment in the hosiery trade is reported from Leicester, but the position of the lace trade is unchanged. There have, however, been a number of inquiries from American buyers, which, it is hoped, will result in increased business. The slight improvement in the boot and shoe industry is maintained, and is expected to continue until Whitsuntide. Few orders, however, are being received from overseas, and travellers abroad report very little business.Miscellaneous Trades. The outlook in the pottery trade is not so favourable and, during the week, a number of workers are reported to have gone on short-time. The chain industry remains slack, and very few new orders are coming in. The carpet trade continues normal. There is considerable depression in the needle, fish-hook and fishing tackle trades, due, it is stated, to the high cost of production and to foreign competition. The serious effect of the decision of the trawler owners to tie up boats owing to the price of fish is being felt at both Milford Haven and Grimsby. At the latter port 180 fishermen have been paid off during the week.In the Metropolitan area unemployment is still abnormal in factory districts. Joiners and carpenters are difficult to place, but the shortage of bricklayers and plasterers is, however, still acute.Transport. There is no change in regard to transport work on the Clyde and in South Wales. At Leith the outlook has improved owing to the arrival of several large cargoes. On the Mersey, more dockers have been employed, but there is no indication that the improvement will be lasting.Industrial Developments. Plymouth report that negotiations are proceeding with a view to developing Padstow as a fishing port. At Newhaven, a new salvage company have commenced operations. Two ships have been secured, and the firm have other contracts in hand for breaking up ships.Women&apos;s Employment.GeneralSituation-The unemployment situation would appear to be steadily growing worse, and the statistics show increases in respect both of totally unemployed women and of those on systematic short time.Local Reports. The North-Western Division report that the situation is somewhat worse. The condition of the textile industry continues very serious, with no prospect of revival. Notification is being received at a number of Exchanges that extended stoppages may be anticipated at Easter. An increasing number of firms are adopting the short-time system, and others are increasing the stoppage period.The situation in the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division is similar to that in Lancashire. Severe depression continues in the woollen and cotton textile centres. The clothing trade remains depressed. Some areas report slight improvements in certain sections of the lace trade, and in the hosiery and making-up trades. In Nottingham, however, it is now expected that the depression will continue until the autumn.The South Midlands and Eastern Division report that there is little change. Slight improvements are apparent in the bootmaking centres, although Northampton report that nearly all factories are still on short time. Some improvement is also reported in regard to clothing firms; Kettering, for example, state that several clothing firms are now working full time.Heavy unemployment continues to be reported from the factory areas of East, South-East and North-East London. At Bermondsey, for example, there is a live register of over 3,000, including tailoresses, shirt and collar makers, jam workers, tin box makers and general factory workers.  In the Deptford area, Messrs. Peek Frean &amp; Co., Ltd.,
biscuit manufacturers, are now discharging women. In the same area, small, but increasing, numbers of tin workers are returning to employment, and there is an improvement in the clothing and allied trades. The Great Maryborough Street Exchange report that dress-making vacancies are increasing, and that the depression in this industry appears to be nearing its close. Other West End Exchanges, however, still report large numbers of unemployed women.There is no improvement in the West Midlands Division, where the engineering, metal, jewellery, motor, cycle and rubber trades continue seriously depressed. The majority of the Exchanges report increasing registers.In the Northern, South-Western and Wales Divisions the situation remains unchanged. In the South-Western Division the clothing industries remain depressed; a considerable number of tinplate workers are unemployed in Wales, and the ropery, textile and clothing works in the Northern Division suffer from the general depression.Scotland report that the situation in the staple industries is not improving. Increasing unemployment and short time is reported generally from the textile centres, and in Glasgow the Exchanges continue to show heavy registers of unemployed women. In Dunfermline there is no improvement in the linen industry. There is increasing unemployment amongst the jute workers of Dundee. Depression in the woollen and hosiery trades is increasing at Galashiels, and, at Paisley, workers discharged by the thread manufacturers, and from carpet weaving and cotton and woollen weaving factories, are lodging claims to unemployment insurance benefit.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Employment and Unemployment. The serious state of unemployment continues to occupy very close attention. Brixton bring forward the work which, before the war, was performed in the Royal Ordnance Factories, and has now been allocated to private firms ; they consider this prejudicial to the interests of the State. They further wish the Govern-ment to explain why their short-time proposals have not resulted in a corresponding additional number of workpeople being employed in Government establishments.Unemployment Insurance. In connection with the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921, the Preston, Chorley and District Committees take exception to the differentiation between ex-Service men and civilians; they suggest that committees should be granted discretionary powers in dealing with claims to benefit from civilian applicants who are unable to fulfil the conditions of employment. Great Yarmouth are of opinion that the men who rendered service in the Trinity House ships should be regarded, for the purposes of the Act, as ex-Service men. Southend request that Exchange managers should be given further powers in the authorisation of claims to benefit.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kewr, for the week ending the 10th March show 295,546 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  266,809 8s. 2d.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 4th March was 978,027, involving an amount of  510,050 9s, lid.Unemployment Fund.-Tlie balance standing to the credit of the Unemployment Fund on the 26th February was  22,202,827. During the period from the 30th January to the 26th February  800,000 was withdrawn from investments, leaving a balance of  21,925,000 invested.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 15th March, 24,750 certificates have been issued to employers under the scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 273,884 disabled ex-Service men. The continued industrial depression has adversely affected the absorption of disabled men into industry, and, to some extent, the rate of enrolments under the National Scheme.In Leeds, arrangements have been made to insert a leaflet on the National Scheme in the programme of the various places of amusement on Warriors&apos; Day; efforts to secure similar publicity are being made in other parts of the country.The Divisional Controller for the West Midlands Division reports that, at several Exchanges, the problem of placing disabled men is becoming acute; many firms who
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 11th March, the Appointments Department placed 447 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 51,807. Of these 6,944 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 728 ex-Service men and 39 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 11th March was 11,437 ex-Service men and 1,219 civilians. At the same date, 899 &quot; live &quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 470 having been registered during the week.have undertaken to employ disabled men now find themselves unable to do so. The proportion of unemployed disabled men, however, compares favourably with the rate of unemployment generally, which is attributed to the sense of responsibility shown by employers and the effects of publicity.JUVENILE  BRANCH.Apprenticeship: Building. The annual report of the Bristol Building Trades Joint Standing Apprenticeship Committee indicates that very satisfactory progress has been made in reviving the apprenticeship system. In August, 1919, when the committee was appointed, a return showed 88 apprentices, of whom many were not really indentured. In December, 1920, the number had been doubled, and all the lads are bound by indentures held by the committee. Until quite recently the committee&apos;s waiting list consisted mainly of boys wishing to become carpenters or plumbers, but at the present time, the other trades are beginning to attract a more than sufficient supply of suitable lads. The committee have also been instrumental in reviving the establishment of building classes, and it is a condition of the indenture that every apprentice must attend these classes one whole day a week, in his employees time, during the first two years of his apprenticeship. It is hoped that these classes will eventually grow into a school of building for the district on the lines of the Brixton School of Building.Domestic Service. A public meeting has recently been arranged by the Worcester Juvenile Employment Committee in order to launch their scheme for popularising resident domestic service for girls. The meeting was well attended. It is hoped that the scheme will be universally adopted by employers in the committee&apos;s area.Centres for Unemployed Juveniles. Up to the present there has been little progress on the part of the education authorities in setting up centres for unemployed juveniles. A number of Juvenile Employment Committees have urged local authorities to take action, but there seems a general disinclination to incur fresh educational expenditure. The Kilmarnock Juvenile Advisory Committee have, however, been successful in inducing the Ayrshire Education Authority to provide classes in domestic service for unemployed girls.Juvenile Committees, however, are still active, in co-operation with organisations for boys and girls, in making provision, generally of an informal character, for unemployed juveniles. Attempts are being made to give some useful training in domestic work to girls. At Gateshead, where the education authority were not prepared to set up a centre, classes for unemployed girls have been opened, and a programme, including cookery, dressmaking, millinery and English, has been drawn up. About 100 girls are attending, and the numbers are said to be increasing. The Westminster Committee are also endeavouring to arrange courses in cooking for girls, in co-operation with the Social Service Union.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 296, 297, 305 and 306.]
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 11th March the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 10 officers or men of similar educational qualifications, of which 8 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,154 applications for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,479 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,819 applications, of which 23,315 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,194 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,363 cases.Business Training $ckwe.-During the week ending the 11th March, the Appointments Department received 121 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 2,792, of which 727 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 607 cases. At the same date, 331 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 57 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 1,122 cases, in 483 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 300 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 122 are still in training, and 15 awaiting training.TRAINING DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 15th March, 24,749 men were in training, as against 24,798 on the 8th March, and 25,134 on the 15th February. During the week 479 men were placed in training. There were 16,490 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 8th March and the 15th February being 16,418 and 16,145, respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 28,071, the totals for the 8th March and the 15th February being 27,543 and 25,972, respectively.Distribution of Trainees.-During the period from the 1st March, 1920, to the 1st March, 1921, the percentage of men undergoing training in Government Instructional Factories rose from 14 to 41 ; during the same period the percentage in &quot; other institutions &quot; fell from 46 to 24. In the days when Government Instructional Factory facilities were on a comparatively small scale; extended use was made of employers&apos; workshops for whole-time training and it is by no means unlikely that, in certain areas at any rate, the possibilities of this particular form of training are by this time nearly exhausted. Trade depression has, in the later months, had the effect of materially reducing the number of men training as improvers.Elementary Teachers. In addition to the five large training college schemes, subsidiary schemes for training 60 manual instructors at Loughborough, and 40 at the Westminster Training College are being considered by the Board of Education, and are to be submitted to the Treasury. Training college schemes bid fair to become a by no means unimportant feature in the work of the department.Government Instructional Factories. During the past week there has been an increase of 80 in the number of men training in Government Instructional Factories ; the increase during the month of February was 427 ; the total now standing at 10,583.At Sarisbury Court a new class in boat building has been started. There are over 100 men at present in training in the Guildford Factory which has been on the active list for about three months only. At the Camden Town Factory, where the work of the men in training is entirely of a productive character, a contract has now been secured from the General Post Office for the repair of mail vans. The contract for the re-wiring of this factory has been placed by the Office of Works with the Hackney Marshes Factory.The number of men in training at the Spring Bank Government Instructional Factory, Hull, is now 156, and classes in carpentry and joinery, watch and clock repairing, tailoring, painting, cabinet-making, bricklaying, plumbing, French polishing, upholstering and storekeeping are in progress. The various adaptations required in the factory are being carried out by men in training.
Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics. Up to the 16th March agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,936 apprentices, under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,884 apprentices, employed by 17,447 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agree-ment between the parties, is now 20,885.Applications. Efforts in connection with unmated apprentices in the London and South-Eastern area are, on the whole, satisfactory, and it is thought that the results of the attempt to provide institutional training will justify the work expended. Meetings of apprentices have been addressed at the Shepherd&apos;s Bush, Richmond, Hastings, Deptford, Tottenham, Stratford, Woolwich and Brighton Employment Exchanges. In Sheffield and Doncaster, the Exchanges report a total absence of unmated apprentices. A large number of belated applications have been submitted to the department, particularly in the North-Western area and in Wales. It would appear that apprentices have been content to receive the best wages they were able to obtain, and now that there is a considerable amount of unemployment, some of these apprentices are anxious to benefit by the scheme.Acceptance and Non-Acceptance. Local headquarters for the South-Western area have received a communication, from the Amalgamated Engineering Union, with regard to engineering apprentices who have been refused re-instatement on demobilisation and are, in consequence, still unemployed. It is suggested that these apprentices be allowed to enter the Dockyard at Devonport as improvers, and count such service as part of their apprentice-ship. They consider that the entry of workmen under the short-time scheme provides a favourable opportunity.Termination or Suspension of Agreements. Messrs. H. Lebus, Tottenham, cabinet makers, have had to discharge approximately 50 apprentices owing to the slackness of trade. The provision of institutional training was suggested, but none of the apprentices wished to avail themselves of the opportunity. The firm promised to restart them as soon as trade improved, but saw no immediate prospect of doing so. Apprentices under the scheme, with Messrs. Pratchitt Bros., Carlisle, general engineers, have complained that they are being suspended. The firm have been obliged to suspend the employees in their fitting shops, for alternate weeks, and in their moulding shops for alternate months, owing to the depression in trade.Institutional Training. Favourable progress is reported in connection with the engineering classes at the Leeds Technical School. Local headquarters hope to place a further 20 apprentices, in either engineering or tailoring, after the Easter vacation. Appli-cations are being received from apprentices in outlying districts. Negotiations with the Oldham Education Committee have been successfully carried through, and a class for fitters and turners will be established at the Technical School as soon as sanction is given by the department. The second class opened at the Robert Gordon Technical College, Aberdeen, is most satisfactory ; the original class&apos;is being treated as an advanced course, to which any promising students in the new class will be transferred.National Trade Advisory Committees: Dental Mechanics. At the last meeting it was agreed that owing to the depression in the industry, due to the uncertainty of the position of dentists under the Bill which the Minister of Health will introduce shortly, no further training should be given at any centre, with the exception of the Borough Polytechnic. Where, however, the whole training period has been in the laboratory of a private dentist, and an undertaking has been given to employ the men at the end of training if progress and conduct are satisfactory, training may be continued. The class at the Borough Polytechnic will be retained so that men who have been granted an additional six months&apos; training by Local Technical Advisory Committees, and are unable to find a dentist to take them for the period, may complete their course if they so desire.Local Technical Advisory Committees: Boat Building. Local Advisory Panels have been established at Portsmouth, Southampton and Reading, and one at Maidstone is in process of formation. It is hoped that a panel may be formed to embrace the district from Chertsey to the mouth of the Thames. The scheme of training is to be carried on at Sarisbury Court, and instructors are now being engaged.
GENERAL TRAINING.Apprenticeship : Building. The joint conference of employers and operatives held at Eastbourne on the 25th February was highly successful; an apprenticeship committee had, indeed, been already formed. The meeting was fully representative and quite unani-mous, so that there is every hope of rapid progress. At Coventry, on the 28th February, a question was raised concerning the provision of technical training, involving attendance at school for one evening a week, and a discussion followed. It was finally decided to set up an apprenticeship committee, and both sides elected their representatives. Joint conferences are to be held at Burton-on-Trent, Malvern and Sutton Coldfield. At Carlisle, there is hope that both sides will meet in the near future, although strained relations exist between employers and operatives in this town.At Kendal the secretary of the master builders&apos; association stated that there was already an apprenticeship scheme in operation, but that the employers and operatives could not agree. A promise was made that the employers should be circularised, and a meeting called on or about the 9th March. The operatives also agreed to call a meeting at an early date.At Leicester, the employers met to consider the scheme last November, but, as yet, no meeting of operatives has been held, as it was hoped to arrange a joint conference without that necessity. The relations between the two sides are, however, strained, and, in the opinion of the employers&apos; secretary, it would be advisable to defer consideration for a little while. Meanwhile the Building Trades Advisory Committee for the district is looking after the interests of apprentices in the industry. The Scottish Regional Education Committee met during the week, to discuss the indenture and to compare it with the draft indenture submitted by a member of the committee. It was finally decided, to adopt the indenture as printed in the scheme.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments xoill also be found on pages 297 and 301.]
APPENDIX.QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT.The following extracts from the Official Report of the proceedings of the House of Commons relate to questions in which the Ministry is interested : Unemployment: Aliens.Major McLean asked the Minister of Labour what precautions are taken, if any, to prevent aliens receiving unemployment pay.Sir M. Barloiv: I would refer my hon. and gallant friend to the reply which I gave to the question asked by the hon. and gallant member for Basingstoke (Colonel Sir A. Hol-brook) on the 7th March. First, as to unemployment benefit under the contributory scheme contained in the Unemployment Insurance Acts, 1920 and 1921, no distinction as regards nationality is made either in the liability to pay contributions or the right to receive un-employment benefit. Secondly, as to out-of-work donation, this is payable to ex-members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, irrespective of nationality, and to merchant seamen who are British subjects. The only case therefore in which the nationality of the applicant is material either for benefit or for donation is that of a merchant seaman claiming donation, and in this case the facts are readily ascertainable by inspection of the seaman&apos;s service papers. (15th March.)Unemployment Pay and Road Schemes.Sir W. de Frece asked the Minister of Labour how much has been distributed in unemploy-ment pay since the 1st January; how much in the same period has been paid out, or promised, from moneys of the Road Board; and how much similarly guaranteed by the Committee presided over by Lord St. Davids.Dr. Macnamara: From the 1st January to the 11th March the approximate amounts paid in unemployment benefit and in out-of-work donation are  5,300,000 and  2,900,000, respectively. Grants towards the construction of arterial roads and the improvement of main roads have been promised since the 1st January to the extent of  850,000. I should mention that the total amount of such grants since the beginning of November last is about  3,000,000. In addition, a sum of approximately equal amount has been made available for local authorities by way of loan. Over and above these figures there are, of course, - the grants made from the Road Fund towards road works in the ordinary course, and with-out special reference to the question of the relief of unemployment.  764,545 has been sanctioned by the Unemployment Grants Committee since 1st January. I ought to add that, with the help of the local authorities, in one way and another, productive work has been found for round about 100,000 men who would otherwise have been unemployed. Further, there are at present registered as wholly unemployed approximately 1,250,000 persons; and, in addition, there are 750,000 working short time, making in all, roughly, 2,000,000 people. Of this total there cannot be many more than about 100,000 who are not in receipt of benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 20s. a week for men, and 16s. for women, or smaller amounts if they are working short time.  (11 th March.)Unemployment (Local Authorities&apos; Schemes).Mr. Clough asked the Minister of Labour if he could inform the House how much money, and to how many schemes, has as yet been distributed by Lord St. David&apos;s Com-mittee ; and whether he can make any deduction as to the number of men who have thereby been removed from the list of those receiving unemployment donation.
Appendix- contmued.Dr. Macnamara: The Unemployment Grants Committee has, so far, guaranteed grants to local authorities amounting approximately to  800,000. These grants are in respect of 520 schemes. It is estimated that the schemes approved will provide employ-ment for 28,271 men. The number of men actually employed under these schemes on the 4th March was 20,698. All these men, with the exception of a small proportion of super-visory staff drawn from the existing staffs of the local authorities carrying on the work, were engaged from the registers of the Employment Exchanges, and it may be assumed that they were, at the time of engagement, in receipt of out-of-work donation or unemploy-ment benefit, except possibly in a few cases where they had exhausted their rights. About 4,400 are employed on a system of short-time working of such a nature that they remain entitled to benefit or donation for the days on which they are not employed. (19$ March.)4
