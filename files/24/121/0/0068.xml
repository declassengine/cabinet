secret cabinet, COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS. Preservation of Public Order Bill. (G.P..2767a,)Circulated in connection with Item 2 on the Agenda for the Meeting of the Home Affairs Committee to be held on Tuesday, May SLst, 1921, at 4.15 p.m.2   Whi*,ella-^ Gardens, S.W., 30th May, 1921.
PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC ORDER BILL.The Home Secretary circulates for the information of the Home Affairs Committeo tho following note by the Director of Public Prosecutions   on Clause 3(5) of the Bill,In ay   opinion, it is essential to preserve this Clause^ beoause it is essential for the purposes of Clause 1 (b), (whioh rakes it an offenoo for a person to havo in his possession for sale or distribution) to provide evidonoe of the intention to sell or distribute.   The mere passive possession of books is not an offence under the Bill,   nor intended to be made one.   It would be most exceptional to find evidence of an intention to distribute. For instance, it would be most unusual to find in possession of a person addressed envelopes with a oircular letter in whioh suoh books were to be enolosod, or a bill showing tho purchase of them, or any memoranda, or letters from other people requesting oopies thereof.   In the absence of suoh evidenoe the case would present itself as a mere passive possession with no evidenoe of intention to sell or distribute, and no evidenoe of having prooured or &quot;obtained- them, beoaube the mere possession of the books is consistent with their having been voluntarily bent to tho person by someone else.   May I remind you of pugiale. v. Tho Queen, Dearsley&apos;8 Drown Oases (1862) p. 61, the head note of whioh reads as follows?- &quot;An indiotnent charged the defendant with preserving and keeping in his possession obscene prints with the intent and for the purpose of unlawfully uttering the same (Held upon Writ of Error indictment insufficient in law),   Campbell, L.0.J, (p.74) saidf- &quot;We must hold the first class of oounts bad because they are consistent with the possibility that the defendant may have had the pictures in his possession with an innooent intention, and there is no aot shown to be done whioh can be considered ac the first step in a prosecution,1The Clause, therefore, ia essential, in ny opinion, to any prosecution for the offence of having in possession for sale or distribution as providing supplementary but not conclusive proof of the intention to sell or distribute.    Whether &quot;three&quot; should be the minimum or not is difficult to decide but I would suggest for practical;purposes no greater number than five should be fixed.The clause is so drafted that even if the minimum number is found in the possession of a person he is not preoluded from proving that they oame into his possession otherwise than for distribution.A.H.B. 28/5/21.8Ba 94.
