L W ]REPORT.The Select Committee appointed to consider what the. Remuneration of Ministers should be : Have agreed to the following Report : 1. Your Committee first heard the evidence of Sir Warren Fisher, K.C.B., the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury. He laid before them a full statement and explanation of the remuneration at present paid to Ministers by the Treasury, and, where required, he furnished supplementary statements from the Departments concerned.2. Your Committee had also the advantage of hearing Mr. Asquith, whose long experience and ready response to the questions put to him with regard to past changes and the present position made his evidence most valuable.8. Before your Committee finally approved their Report the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at his own request, gave evidence on the nature and historic importance of the tie that links the office of First Lord of the Treasury to that of the Prime Minister. Your Committee did not feel that this evidence conflicted with their recommendations, and they recognise that the office of First Lord of the Treasury would naturally bo held by one of the leading Ministers, if not by the Prime Minister himself.4. The standards of work and pay upon which the present scale of remuneration has been built tin were very different from those obtaining to-day, whether temporary or permanent, and a new factor has certainly arisen in the adoption by the House of the principle of the payment of Members, a payment in which Ministers do not participate. Rut whilst the terms of the order of Reference, finally adopted by the House, are wide enough to cover an exhaustive review of the situation, your Committee do not feel that this is a suitable time to recommend, by a general increase in Ministers&apos; remuneration, a large addition to the total amount of money allocated for the payment of Ministers. They have, therefore, chiefly confined themselves to considering the relative position as between one Minister and another, having regard to their responsibilities or to the work of the office held.5. Fron i the evidence laid before them, your Committee are of the opinion that official residences Appendix in London are a negligible factor in a Ministers remuneration.  They therefore recommend that Q*. I9and! no Minister should receive an allowance in respect of a house which he does not occupy, nor, on the 1 &apos; other band, should he suffer a reduction of salary if he chooses to accept the offer of the official residence.(j. Considering the increasing burdens and responsibilities which recent Prime Ministers have had to bear, your Committee are of the opinion that the remuneration of the office is inadequate and should certainly exceed that of other Cabinet Ministers. Indeed, it is very doubtful whether any () ^ man called to that high office during recent reigns could have sustained the position without 1 0&apos; private means. They therefore recommend that the salary of the Prime Minister, as such, be fixed at  8,000 per annum, whether or not he holds the office of First Lord of the Treasury, the remuneration of which should be abolished.&quot;t. Your Committee have also agreed to the following recommendations: (a) That all members of the Cabinet, with the exception of the Prime Minister, should receive the same total salary, irrespective of the office held.(b) That the difference between the salaries attached to what may be called first and second class Ministries, which appears to your Committee to be unjustifiably wide, be reduced as shewn in Schedule I.(c) That the distinction in the salaries of the various Parliamentary and Under-Secretaries, except in certain cases of special responsibility, such as the Financial and Parliamentary Secretaries to the Treasury, should be abolished.8. Hitherto when the Prime Minister has desired the services in the Cabinet of a colleague free from the burden of heavy departmental work he has appointed him to one of four practically sinecure offices, namely, to that of the First Lord of the Treasury, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord President of the Council or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. More recently a Minister without Portfolio has been created. Your Committee recommend that the remuneration attaching to these offices, but not the offices themselves, should be abolished, and that instead the Prime Minister should be entitled to bring up to Cabinet rate of remuneration any unpaid or less highly paid office-helder, so long as that particular Minister holds a seat in the Cabinet, and any sums g hedule ii so allocated should be placed on the Estimates under tho head of the Cabinet. Tne remuneration attaching to the above sinecure offices now amounts to  19,000 per annum, but your Committees estimate is based on the assumption that the Prime Ministers normal requirements under this paragraph would not exceed  10,000 in any one year.0.211. a 2
Appendix,Schedule II, Table A.9. Your Committee recommend the following classification oi offices into which, with tho exception of tho Prime Minister and the Law Officers, they are of opinion that all Ministers can bo suitably divided: 1st class at  -5,000 per annum, 2nd class at  3,000 per annum. 3rd class at  2,000 per annum. 4th class at  1,500 por annum. 5th class at  1,000 per annum.10. Whilst it will lie seen that the present offices naturally fall into the above classification, your Committee make a special recommendation thai the Secretary for Scotland and the President of the Board of Education be raised to First class rank. In the former ease a Lord Advocate, on being appointed Secretary for Scotland, has had to sacrifice  3,000 of his salary, tho superior position being paid less than tho lower. The growing responsibilities attaching&apos; to the Head of the Board of Education ought also to command tho services of a Minister of the First rank.11. With regard to the Ministry of Transport, your Committee tool that, unless unforeseen developments occur in the future, the work of I his Department does not seem to merit more than Second class rank.12. Your Committee are of the opinion that the Lord Chancellors salary from the Consolidate 1 Fund should not exceed that of a First-class Minister, namely  5,000 per annum, lbs remuneration as Speaker of the House of Lords they feel is outside thoir terms of reference.13. Your Committee have not taken special evidence with regard to the remuneration of the Law Officers but certain&apos;memoranda have been submitted to them which shew that tho system varies in England, Scotland and Ireland, and has been subject to changes from time to time, * That now in force shews that in England ;i fixed salary is paid, and that certain fees for contentious business are allowed, in return the officers give a whole-time service. Alter consideration of the figures set out in Appendix No. 1.11., your Committee recommend that the salaries of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, at present fixed at  7,000 and  6,000 per annum respectively, be each reduced by  2,000 per annum, on the understanding- that their lees tor contentious business should remain.In Scotland and Ireland an inclusive sum is paid to cover all services and your Committee do not recommend any alteration in the salary attached to the offices of Lord Advocate, Solicitor-General for Scotland, Attorney-General for Ireland or the Solicitor-General for Ireland.14. In making this Report your Committee have had in mind the fact that the operative result of their recommendations as ;i whole would bo practically to balance any resulting increaseiby the reduction or abolition of a number of salaries.SCHEDULE I.Shewing in Detail the Composition of the Various Classes of Ministers,The Prime Minister-Salary  8,000 per annum.Class I.-Salary  5,000 per annum.
