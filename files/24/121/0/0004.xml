:; i)0CUMENT If, THE PROPERTY OF HI&apos;. BRITANNIC W^tohv GOTTOMW,      1)c2704.RET. CABINET.Post Office Finance,, /Memorandum &quot;by the Post Master-General,1.     The Cabinet decided on M-TQh 31st 1920, &quot;that as a natter of principle, the Post Office must pay its way. due regard being had to the services rendered by it to all other Government Departments&quot;.   In view of this decision, I desire to bring before the Cabinet the present position of Post Office Finance and to obtain a decision as to what increases, if any, should be made in the rates charged to the public.2,    The Revenue and Expenditure of the Post Offi-e for the next two years are estimated as follows:-1921-22 1922-23   Revenue 66,, 600,000 68,100,000Expenditure        70,100;000 67,900,000Deficit  3,500,000 Surplus     200,000These forecasts are based upon the &quot;Oom ercial Accounts&quot;, i.e* they include allowances for services rendered by and to other Government departments and in certain other respects they differ from the Revenue and Appropriation Accounts,For the purpose of estimating the &apos;/ar Bonusj an average cost of living figure of 140 has been assumed for 1921-22 and 115 for 1922-23.   Some revival of trade and consequent expansion of Revenue in 1922-23 has been allowed for.I need scarcely say that in present conditions these forecasts are largely conjectural, especially in the second year, and they may be vitiated by a continued slump in trade or by any considerable concession to the constant
demands of the Postal staff, ...3,    Any increase in Postal charges will&quot;Tio-^tffrt-^excltei opposition *nd will be represented as an obstacle to the revival of trade.  But even if the Cabinet were prepared to acquiesce in the continuance of a deficit for 1921-22, the margin for 1922-23 on the present rates would be too small to count on with confidence,   I recommend therefore that the following increases should be immediately intro-duced but I should like authority to announce t^at as soon as a surplus is probable, some of the charges will be reduced,4,    Foreign and Colonial Hates,Foreign Letters,    Present Rate 2^d for 1 ounce &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ljd for each additional ounce.Proposed Rate 3d for 1 ounce ljd for each additional ounce.Estimated increase of Revenue   70,000Letters for British ^imposed^e and U.fi,AoPresent Rate 2d for 1 ounce Id, for each additional ounceProposed rate 2d for 1 ounce and i4d for each additional ounce.Estimated increase of Revenue   55.000oPrinted Papers.

The total increase of Revenue on the Foreign and Colonial post would the^ne  600,000,5c     I understand the CsaEiOsllor of the Exchequer would prefer to fix the foreign letter rate at 4d instead of 3d, which with certain consequential increases would yield an additional  130,000 per annum0    Having regard to the increases upon ether charges9 t agree that a 4d rate could not he regarded as exor   bitant.   Rut in my opinion there are strong reasons for keeping the foreignrates as low as possible,   The rates to be charged ineepecjia3.1.j! these with depreciated currencies several other ecur-tri e3,/*dl.l be considerably lower thanthe British rates, allowing for the difference in exhange, e0gt the German rate will probably be 1 mark,equivalent to about ldj and the French and Belgian rates will be 50 centimes, equivalent to about 2id9   moreover the United States, Spain, and most of the South american countries, have concluded an agreement inter se underwhich correspondence passing between the parties to theagreement will be carried at the inland rates.   these rates will probably be the equivalent of Id or 2d.   Ahigh British ,rate will certainly be represented asplacing the British trader at a disadvantage with foreign competitors, and especially with the United States in competition for the South American trade, and.,will increase the anomalies which to some extent are inevitableas the result of the widely different rates prevailing inEurope.   Having regard to the relatively small amount ofrevenue at stake, I think a 3d rate would suffice *6.

I am afraid there ia no possibility of any considerable reduction of Post Office expenditure (apart frcsm the automatic reduction of the War Bonus) exoept by a restriction of public facilities.    Such restrictirns are invariably unpepular and cause widespread irritation, but if the Cabinet consider that the present state of national finance justifies drastic action, I think the measure which would secure the maximum saving with the minimum inconvenienoe to the public   would be the abolition of Sunday collections and deliveries.
5.     In its meat comprehensive form, this would mean the complete oossaticn (with seme minor exooptiens), both of the sorting and conveyance of mails and the collection and delivery of letters from midnight Saturday to midnight Sunday, and the saving would be nearly  1,000,000 per annum, a boat 90/. of whioh would be immediately realised.9,     The general arguments for this oourso may be stated as follows:-(a) London has not had a Sunday delivery within living memory, and in Scotland they are the exception.(\) A considerable proportion of letters delivered on Sunday, i.e. those addressed to business premises, are in faot not opened till Monday and the labour and expenditure in dealing with them on Sunday is purely wasted.    The majority of the letters whioh will be delayed will be private sad domestip rather tfcan . oommeroial correspondence.(o)   It is a measure which will appeal to tho advocates of the restriction of Sunday labour.(d)   It will not increase the number of unemployed because it will merely involve a rdduotion of the extra payments for Sunday duty at present made to the f^st Offioe staff. 10*   The arguments against it are -(a) It will undeniably cause a considerable slowing down of the oourse of post as regards correspondence posted on Saturday or Sunday.(b) It will excite vigorous protest from many quarters, ospecially the smaller towns, those rural.areas whioh have only one delivery a day, and seaside resorts which depend for their prosperity on week-end visitors.(a) Although the reduction of Sunday labour has been a plank in the platform of the Post Office Trade Unions, the abolition
i will probably meet with determined opposition as 90$ of the saving will bo made at the expanse of the extra ww&amp;xw&amp;Efa of the Post Office staff    If a domand for compensation which is asrtain to be made were admitted, a large part of the saving would disappear. 1,     The offoat of tho soheme will be as followsfl) No letters would bo delivered on Sunday morning, ncr oould letters bo obtained by oallers   at local Post Offines, because tho inward mails, if any4 would not bo sortocL    It might be possible to make Special arrangements in the larger towns for delivery of urgent letters prepaid an Express Fee.fS) No collection would be made from pQlar boxes or Pest Offices anywhere in the country on Sunday, osoopt pos&amp;i&amp;Xy a,collection late on Sunday night in London and cor bain towns intended mainly for local letters.(3) No mails would be sorted on Sunday either in London or the Provinces.(4) Mails would be despatched from one office to another .either on Saturday or Sunday night, but not on both,    Certain special Postal trains would be run sis nights per week instead of seven, and certain Sunday night mail trains would bo rcleaned, so far as the Post Offioe is oonoerned, and oould bo taken off if not required for other traffic.IS.    the  following examples may give a better idea of the practioal results -fl) No letter posted in London or the Provinces after about mid-day Saturday would be delivered anywhero outside the looal area before Monday moraing.(2) Letters posted in London on Sunday would bo delivered in towns as far North as Manchester or York on Monday evening but in rural areas, the extreme North of England,
England, Scotland and Ireland, they would not secure delivery until Tuesday morning.   Similarly letters,, pentad in. the^I^rxnT-rure^-&apos;-cn Sunday will net be delivered elsewhere until late on Monday or oarly Tuesday, according to distance .(3)   Letters passing from one Provincial town to another and transitting London would be delayed by anything up to 24 hours, e.g. letters posted on Saturday evening at Plymouth or Brighton would net be delivered at Cambridge until Monday afternoon and at Edinburgh till Tuesday morniug.(4)   In many rural areas there would be no moans of receiving letters between Saturday morning and Monday morning or of posting them between Saturday afternoon and lionday afternoon.13.        A less drastic alternative would be to abolish all Sunday deliveries and all Sunday collections froti Pillar boxes, letter boxes and the rural Post Offices, but to maintain a collection at the head office in towns, and to .maintain the conveyance of mails on Sunday night as at present,ThiB would not improve the position in rural areas but it would enable the public in all the larger towns and most small ones at the expense of some trouble to retain whatever facilities they new have for Sunday posting and it would accelerate the delivery of correspondence posted on Saturday evening, which would not under the larger scheme secure delivery on Monday morning.14.      On the other hand it Y/ould prevent any appreciable saving on conveyance, whether by road or rail which would have to bemaintained practically unchanged, and it would involve a con-siderable amount of Sunday labour for sorting mail3 etc.     Itwould also be difficult to draw the line between the small townnwhich would have and those which would not have a Sunday oollec-tion and there would bo considerable local pressure to extend the concession.The saving is estimated at  600,000 instead of  1,000,000,(Signed)   ALBERT ILLIIGWORTH.Post Office, oh TithT&quot;1921,
