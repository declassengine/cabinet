OOpy, BOARD OF IFaSS,Great George Street, S.V. 1.16th March, 1921.Sir,In handing over the Trading Agreement &quot;between the British Government and the Russian Soviet Government, signed of this date, I am instructed on behalf of Hio Majesty&apos;s Government to bring to the notice of the Soviet Government facts within their knowledge which disclose activities on the part of the Soviet Government in the regions of India and Afghanistan which are inconsistent with the stipulations in the Agreement, and which therefore must at once be brought to an end if the good faith of the Agreement is to be observed.The Soviet Government have made no secret in their public statements and in their official press that the main object of their eastern policy is the overthrow of British rule in India;   and His 2&amp;j.treaty,fl Government hfve for a long time past been aware of toe intrigues in which the Soviet Govern-ment, with their agents, subordinates and associates, have been engaged, by various means and from different directions, for the furtherance of thet object.     One channel of approach, to which attention has been particularly drawn as a result of recent negotiations, is that through Afghanistan.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have the strongest reasons for believing that one of the main objects on the part of the Soviet Govern-ment, of the negotiations the-t have been proceeding between that Government and the Government of Afghanistan   .  -hasKrassin. - 1 -
has been to -secure faciljrtteff-for.attacks through Afghanistan against the peace of India,     The Russian Envoy at Kabul Suritz has made a point, in his negotiations with the Afghan Government, of assistance to be rendered by the Soviet Govern-ment to the tribes on the North-West frontier of India. Throughout the negotiations he has maintained as one of the principal demands to be conceded by the Afghans a guarantee of safe transport through Afghanistan without delay of a large number of rifles and large quantities of ammunition for the frontier tribes on the British side of the border. This, as he and his Government cannot fail to be aware, is an act of direct hostility to India:   the grant of the guarantee and the grant of facilities by the Afghanistan Government would, as the Afghans know, not be tolerated by the Indian Government:   and to instigate the Afghan -., Government into taking such a step is no less a direct act of hostility.The arrival of arms and ammunition would by itself, as the Soviet Government well know, be almost sufficient to incite the tribes into turbulence and aggression on Indian territory.   Not content with this probability, but deter-mined to make sure of the result, the Soviet representative has established communication with the more consistently anti-British of the tribal leaders, and in so doing he has been careful to implicate leading Afghans, notably Nadir Khan, the comm^nder-in-chief, with whom Suritz had a confidential interview when certain tribal maliks had been summoned by the former to Kabul,     Nor has Suritz alone been indulging in these intrigues.    Jamal Pasha, whose mission to Afghanistan-tan waa undertaken with the approval of Moscow as it was felt no doubt tnat his presence would appeal to the religious as well aa national sentiment of the Afghans, has been in touchwith
with the tribal leaders and, having been assured that tae necessary funds would be supplied by the Soviet Government, has promised the..1, even larger quantities of munitions than Surits: did.     Llahendra Pratap, an Indian renegade, who was a German agent during the War, and who accompanied Suritz to Kabul, has been similarly active among the tribes within, as well as without, British limits in a more northerly direction, along the Chicral frontier, Y/akhan and on the Pamirs.   Mahendra Pratap is but one of a band of notorious Indian seditionists, most of whom were German agents, and who have for many years used every means of attacking British Government in the Sast.     A number of these are now employed under Bolshevik auspices and maintained by Bolshevik funds in disseminating disloyalty in India and fomenting an Anti-British feeling in countries contiguous to India, principally in Afghanistan. Amongstthese it is sufficient to name Barkatallah who accom-panied the first Bolshevik envoy, Bravin, to Kabul, and is again there having accompanied Jamal Pasha:   Acharigah and Abdur Rab who accompanied Suritz to Kabul:   Mookerjee, who is with the Central Government in Moscow, and Marabindra 17atu Rcy now at Tashkend in Turkestan.Were nothing known of the present activities of these self-convicted traitors the fact of their employment by the Russian Government would be enough to cast the gravest suspicion on the good-faith of the Soviet Government towards Great Britain in the Sast.     But it is well-known that such of these persons as are or have been in Kabul have been there for the purpose of establishing touch with disloyal elements in India.     Rey&apos;s presence in Tashkend is due to a more elaborate undertaking of the same nature.     At Tashkend is established the advanced base for Indian work, with a politi-cal department and a military technical centre;   here isprovided
provided instruction in revolutionary tactics for all Indians arriving in Turkestan from whatever direction.     From this group already emissaries have &quot;been despatched into India tferough Afghanistan.     If it is contended that a revolutionary base situated so far from the Indian frontier as Tashkend can threaten no serious danger to India, the reply is furnished by the opinion pronounced by Suritz that Tashkend is only a Pis-aller:   he has declared his conviction that the base will have to be removed to Kabul as soon as circumstances permit:   that unless close contact is established by the base with India itself and with the tribes on the Indian frontier, good work is beyond the power of the base;   at Kabul only can its object be achieved.The intention of the Soviet Government in the matter is disclosed beyond possibility of concealment:     it is a point on which Jamal Pasha has received instructions precisely similar to those Suritz is endeavouring to carry out.Similarly, to facilitate the spread of revolutionary teaching in India Suritz endeavoured to secure from tho Afghans facilities, under treaty righto, for the establish.-ment of printing presses in Kabul;   and it is beyond di spu g e that propaganda in India would bo a prominent function of the Consulates which he aims at establishing at Kandahar, Ghazia, and Jalalabad,     Though in deference to Afghan representations the consummation of these objects also may have been postponed for the present, the intention is plain.But though Soviet representatives may be unwilling to press the Afghan Government too much on these points at the moment, they have stated that they have already sent emis-saries into India to investigate the possibilities of revolu-tionary work whether in t-*e Army, among fie agrarian or indus-trial population or by organising t/ie extremist politicalclasses
classes on lines favourable to Bolshevik and revolutionary projects, and that they nave received a report from one of these agents to tie effect that it only remains for the Central Government at lib boon to sanction the energetic prosecution of activities so incompatible with the geneially accepted func-tions of a diplomatic representative,     Reference has already been made to tne recent negotiations for t le conclusion of a treaty between the Soviet Government and the Afghan Govern-ment:   and to some of the proposals put forward.   It is desirable to summarise briefly the principal grounds for complaint, apart from those already mentioned, which His LIajesty&apos;3 Government find in these proceedings.     Tie British Government take no objaction to the conclusion between the Afghan and Soviet Governments of treaty engagements providing in the usual way for neighbourly relations and commercial intercourse, although they must point out that even the Imperial Russian Government recognised that Afghanistan lay outside its sphere of influence.     But the arrangements aimed at by the Soviet Government in recent negotiations provide among other   things for gifts of money, munitions, and aeroplanes to the Afghan Government, and for the establish-ment of Soviet Consulates on the eastern borders of Afghan-istan.     Whatever view they might in other circumstances possibly have taken of such provisions, His Liajesty&apos;s Govern-ment are compelled in tne present instance, bearing   in mind the avowed desire of the .. Soviet Government to overthrow British rule in India, and the fact that Russia has no possible commercial or otner interests in Eastern Afghanistan, to regard these proposals on the part of the Soviet Government as anti-British measures pure and simple.Evidence
Evidence is also not wanting of recent operations even more immediately hostile on the part of the Soviet Government. It is known that Indian revolutionaries have urged the forma-tion of a military centre on the Chitral Pamir frontier.   An Army Order issued bv the Soviet authorities has announced the unfurling of the red flag on the Pamirs as an indication to the people of India that their deliverance is at hand;   and tnere is reason to believe that a project for action in these regions is now under consideration.Enough has been said to indicate the general nature of the activities of the Soviet Government, upon the cessation of which His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist as an essential corollary to the conclusion of the Trade Agreement between the two Governments.I am,Sir,Yours faithfully, (Signed) R. S. HORIffi, President of the Board of Trade.
