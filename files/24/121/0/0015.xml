W.-E.The War Office,15*/* March, 1921.68I circulate the report of Lord Cavan&apos;s Committee on Battle Clasps which was. appointed by my predecessor.  The recommendations of the Committee as to the battles  ^-L in each theatre which should qualify for clasps are given in the appendices.   In    11 addition, it will be observed that, in the cas*i of France, year clasps are recommended for all who crossed clearly defined lines for any period in any year during which they did not qualify for any battle clasps.The Committee recommend that the issue of clasps to Staff officers of corps and higher formations should be very strictly limited, but they have omitted from their lists certain officers such as the Sub-Chief, General Staff, and the Brigadier-General, General Staff (Intelligence^, at General Headquarters who took a very prominent share in the operations, and I consequently propose to make certain alterations in these lists.The Standing Committee on Claims, to which reference is made, was proposed by my predecessor to adjudicate on the claims of any officer or man who desired to show that he was entitled to any clasp by reason of having been on duty within the range of the enemy&apos;s field artillery during the period in question.A suggestion to confer gold crosses on Commanders has since been abandoned.The report was approved in principle by my predecessor and on his instructions Treasury sanction was sought in order to proceed. It was impossible to estimate the financial effect with any pretension to accuracy, but on such data as were available it was thought that some 24,000,000 clasps would be issuable at a cost of about l  millions to Army funds for manufacture alone. The work would be spread over at least 4 or 5 years and only a very small part of the expense would fall in 1921-22.The Treasury have replied that the scheme will require Cabinet authority, and ask for an estimate of the cost of administering it. Here, again, it is impossible to estimate with precision, but 150,000^. is suggested.I am inclined to think that we are almost too far committed to the scheme, both at Home and in the Dominions (which were represented on the Committee) to be able to abandon it. There also is unquestionably a very strong and legitimate desire on the part of all &quot; fighting men&quot; to receive battle clasps; year clasps would, in my opinion, be valueless.   I consequently ask for Cabinet authority to proceed.(B21/120)  100  3/21  H&amp;S, Lid.  9085wo

SECOND   REPORT   OF   THE   COMMITTEE   ON   BATTLECLASPS.Thft previous Report of the Committee on Battle Clasps is cancelled.In accordance with instructions from the Secretary of State, the Committee re-assembled, and submit the following recommendations: Principles.1. All clasps are the reward of risk or responsibility.The medal being issuable only to those who went overseas, is the reward of those whose duties kept them in the rear and at the bases, or on lines of communication.2. The Committee recognize that in France many men did duty in the trenches or at the guns who were wounded and incapacitated, and who might not be rewarded with a clasp. To meet this a year clasp is recommended to all who crossed clearly defined lines (see Map X.) in any year for any period, however short.3. No Staff Officer of any description may earn more than ten clasps, but any actual fighting man who is entitled to more than ten clasps should most certainly receive them.4. Following the precedent of the Peninsular War, the Committee recommend that a gold cross be awarded to Commanders-in-Chief, which should bear simply the name of the theatre of war and the years engaged, e.g.: Lord Haig........      France and Belgium,1915-1918.General Milne       ..      ,.      ..      Macedonia,1916-1918.Lord Allenby       ..      .,      ..      Palestine,1916-1918.&amp;c, &amp;c.5. Army Commanders should also receive a gold cross with any two names for clasps that they may select, e.g. Lord Plumer would probably chooseYPKES. MESSINES.Lord ByngOAMBRAI. ARRAS.Lord RawlinsonSOMME. AMIENS.6. The Committee consider that the following Staff Officers are entitled to receive clasps for actions in which their units were engaged : Brigade Staffs and Divisional Staffs   All.Corps Staffs    .      ..      ,.      ..

BOLTON, Major.RESERVATIONS OF ADMIRALTY REPRESENTATIVESI regret I am unable to concur with the proposals contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the report, in reference to the award of gold crosses. Their bestowal, besides being expensive, opens up a very difficult question and establishes a precedent. Moreover, if they are sanctioned for the Army, the award would have to be extended to officers of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force with corresponding responsiblities.The crosses for the Peninsular War are quoted as a precedent, but these were authorized at a period when campaign medals were not granted to all officers and&apos;men. Gold medals were then granted to General Officers and to officers commanding units for their first, second and third engagements. For the fourth engagement a gold cross Was substituted, the names of the four battles appearing on the limbs. For every succeeding battle a gold clasp was worn on the ribbon of the cross.   No junior officers or men received these awards.Before this time naval gold medals, large for flag officers andjsmall tor commanding officers of ships, were granted for victories at sea. Their award provided the necessary precedent for the Army medals and crosses subsequently authorized.Waterloo was practically the first instance where a general medal was granted to all officers and men engaged in the battle and, ever since then, with the subsequent establishment of battle clasps, the same custom has obtained. -The present suggestion abrogates the important principle that officers and men, whatever their rank, shall receive the same medal and, for this reason, as well as on the score of expense, I regret I am unable to concur in the proposal.(Sd.)        R. W. bentinck, Rear-Admiral.Uth June, 1920.
