Worthington Evans circulated to the Cabinet the Report of an inter-Departmental Commit tee dealing with these operations.2. The second section of the Report is concerned with &quot;the form of any system of arbitration or audit to settle up the War Office account with India, not only in regard to Meshed, but generally.&quot; Arrangements have already been made for dealingwith the only question1 of  war expenditure-Indian Wiir Stores Suspense Account.      rcqilirjllg   specju]    treatment   apart   from  thatof expenditure in Mast Persia.   As regards the latter, the Committee was not inagreement3. The majority, consisting of the War Orlice and Treasury members, considered that the determination of the incidence of the expenditure in question turned upon two distinct groups of issues, that the questions under one; of these groups appeared to bo clearly justifiable issues properly to be determined by arbitration, and that on the findings the Cabinet itself should proceed to determine the questions of policy imder the second group.4. The India Cilice members were unable to agree to arbitration for reasons stated in their report.5. In the Majority Report it is stated that the reasons of the India Office representatives for objecting to arbitration are based, &quot; if we correctly apprehend &quot;them, . . . on the view that the standing arbitration agreement is no longer &quot; in force, owing to political changes in India, and that the determining factor in any &quot; such, dispute under present conditions must he the state of native opinion and &quot; feeling in that country,&quot; This statement does not correctly represent the attitude of the India Office representatives, nor was it their intention to suggest that, as a result of the political changes which have taken place in India, the arrangements arrived at in 1902 as an outcome of the Wei by Commission should be abrogated.(i. Those arrangements contemplated that two distinct methods of procedure should be followed in the case of, firstly, departmental or administrative questions and, secondly, for the settlement of disputed incidence of charges for the employment outside India of troops borne on the Indian establishment.7. For the first class of questions, namely, those having a departmental character only, it was proposed and agreed, that these might appropriately be referred for arbitration to &quot; a man of judicial position.&quot; It was further proposed that in such cases both Governments should bind themselves beforehand to accept the arbitrators award.8. It was recognised, however, that an arbitrator could not properly deal with the second class of questions, being, as these are, questions of policy, and for the purpose of endeavouring to secure agreement in such cases the Wei by Commission put forward the following specific recommendation : &quot;For the object in view a Committee might, perhaps, be constituted of two members appointed by Your Majesty&apos;s Government and two members appointed by the Secretary of State in Council and of a chairman to be selected by the four members. The Committee should make a report to the Government, which should be presented to Parliament, and the Government within a prescribed time should present its final determination for the ratification of the two Houses. The Treasury Minute (*.e., as to the degree of interest to India attaching to military operations in various countries) would aid the Committee of the two Governments in arriving at a decision.&quot;9. Tliis procedure was decided upon after considerable discussion with the Treasury in 1901 and .1902 (House of Commons 169 of 1902, copy attached), and I am willing that it should be followed in the present case. I wish at the same time to make it quite clear that in consenting to this conference I must reserve to the Secretary of State in Council, the powers conferred upon him by section 21 of the Government of India Act, under which the expenditure of the revenues of India is subject to his control, and no grant or appropriation of any part of those revenues can be made without the concurrence of a majority of votes at a meeting of the Council of India.E.

0 1oNo. 1.Despatch from the Secretary of Stale for India to the Government of India, No. 178 (Financial), datedJSth October 1900,In continuation of my Despatch, dated the 19th of July, Xo. 120, regarding the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure respecting the apportionment of the Home Charges, I transmit, for the information of your Govern-ment, a copy of the correspondence1 that has taken place on the subject,2. Your Excellency will observe that those recommendations, after the necessary correction, would have resulted in the relief of Indian revenues by 257,000/. a year; and that, although it has been thought convenient t.-) simplify the Accounts by an alteration of the mode of giving that relief, the Imperial Government have consented to arrangements which will amount approximately to the same annual sum.I have, &amp;c, (Signed)     Georgk Hamilton.No. 2.Despatch from the Secretary of Stale for India to Ike Government of India, No. 191 (Financial), dated 1st November 1900.Your Excellency is aware that a Royal Commission was appointed on the 24th of May 1805, &quot; to inquire into the administration and management of the &quot; Military and Civil Expenditure incurred under the authority of the Secretary of &quot; State for India in Council, or of the Government of India, and the apportionment &quot; of charge between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of India, for &quot; purposes in which both are interested.&quot; The Commission presented its Report to Her Majesty on the Ctli of April .1900 ; and copies of the Report, and of the Evidence and Appendices, have been in clue course forwarded to your Government.2. In considering the recommendations of the Commission, it appeared to me that it would be a convenient course to determine, in the first instance, in concert with the other departments of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the manner and extent of the assistance that should be given to the Indian Treasury, by relieving it of certain expenditure defrayed in England ; and I have, in my Despatch dated the 18th of October, No. 178, communicated to you the arrangements on which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have arrived at a decision.3. I now, therefore, proceed to address Your Excellency on the other recom-mendations contained in the Report. I do not deem it necessary to enter on the subjects, undoubtedly of great importance, to which the report of a minority of the Commission refers, which have frequently been discussed in correspondence between the Government of India and the Secretary of State, and which the majority of the Commission held to be beyond the terms of reference.4. The Report begins with a description of the financial machinery of the Para. 51. Government of India, both in India and in England; and I observe with pleasure that they consider that the result is satisfactory, and the system in India theoretically Paras. 62, complete, so far as regulations can establish a sound financial control. 341.5. On the question of audit there is a difference of opinion.   It is admitted that a complete audit exists, by means of which any erroneous payment is promptly paraSi corrected; and that there is a valuable test audit, by means of which the Comptroller and 87-8. and Auditor-General is able to form a judgment as to the efficiency of the local audits, and which, if applied on a sufficient scale, satisfies all the objects of an independent audit.  As, however, the system differs from that adopted in England, where the1 See Parliamentary Paper 387 of Session 2 of 1900.
Comptroller and Auditor-General is independent of the Government, and responsible i*ava. 89, ou\y to Parliament which votes the supplies, some members of the Commission desire that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in India should be detached from, and independent of, the Government. Other members, however, observe that there is L nothing in the evidence to support such a recommendation, which would involve a &quot; considerable charge on the Indian taxpayer; and they deprecate the adoption of a measure which might suggest that the Government needed to be checked in the auditing of its expenditure, by an independent authority set up in India.(&apos;). The question was considered by two Secretaries of State in \6S2, and by a third in 1889, and I see no reason for taking a different view, especially as, owing to the divergence of opinion, the Commission abstained from making any recommendation. Pam S7 I may* however, direct your attention to the suggestion that a uniform rule should be established for the record of objections and queries that arise in the course of audit.Para. 00.k&apos;. In regard tu the Appropriation Reports, Your Excellency will observe that the Commission recommend that they should follow the form adopted by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the United Kingdom, and that the result ol&apos; the Comptroller&apos; GenoraPs test audit should be embodied in the Heport.Para. 91. 8. The Commission further recommend that these reports should be forwardedtome by your Government, for reference to a Standing Committee, on which there should be the Comptroller and Auditor-General in this country, and another member unconnected with the India Ollice ; and that the report of that Committee, with the views of your Government on the Accounts, and a Minute by the Secretary of State in Council on the subject, should be laid before Parliament. It appears to me that such a course would necessarily defer for an unduly long time the examination of any points that may be of interest to the blouse of Commons, which would prefer to discuss the circumstances of the current year, as set forth in the Financial Statement of your Government, rather than questions relating to the regularity of procedure in the Accounts of a past year. It is, however, desirable that the full supply of copies of that Statement should be transmitted at an earlier date than in the last two years.Para. 9. The object which the Commission have in view is that; the body which grants the money for the public service should be satislied that its grants are properly expended ; and in respect of India it is not Parliament, but your Government, which, with the approval, expressed or implied, of the Secretary of State in Council, grants the money, and should therefore require to be so satislied. While, then, it is proper that the Secretary of State in Council, should exercise the financial control delegated to him by Parliament, and that the Secretary of State should be held by Parliament responsible for the due exercise of that control, it would, in my opinion, be a disadvantage to remove from the Government of India and from the Secretary of State in Council the linal responsibility for ascertaining in detail that the funds which it granted have been properly spent.Para. 94. 10. The proposal that the Home Accounts should he referred to a similarCommittee is less open to objections of a practical, nature, because the officers and documents to be examined are in this country, and available without the loss of time that would be involved in such an examination of the Indian Accounts. Considering, however, that all expenditure defrayed in England must be sanctioned by the Council specially created by Parliament for the purpose, and must be audited by the Auditor, whose report is always laid before Parliament, I am not disposed to think, that it is necessary to make any change in the existing system.Para. 67. 11. The Commission refer, as deserving favourable consideration, to a suggestion made by Viscount &quot;Cromer that, in order to enable the Secretary of State to have the unreserved expression of the views of the Financial Member of your Council, lie, in common with the other Members, should be at liberty to forward, through the Viceroy, to the Secretary of State, a contidential Memorandum, which should not be publishedPace 144. without his consent. It is not stated whether this Memorandum by a Member of Council is to be withheld from his colleagues, but I gather that this was the intention of the Commission, as Sir dames Peile has recorded his dissent from such a course.
ill221.12. 1 see no sufficient reason for altering the usual procedure. The only con-stitutional method of laying the views of the Government of India before the Secretary of State is by means of a Despatch signed by all the Members, to which any of them are at liberty to attach a minute of dissent or explanation, it is the duty of each member of your Government to express his opinion unreservedly to his colleagues, on any question of moment, it he differs from them ; and there is no ground for with-holding from them the written expression of the. views which he should have set before them in oral discussion, To maintain more freedom than could be used in a paper intended for publication, he has only to mark it as confidential, in order to ensure that it will not be published without his consent.13. The Commission mention, without expressing any opinion, the supposed Pura. 68. preponderance of the military element in your Excellency^ Council, owing to the circumstance that both the Commander-in-Chiel: and one of the ordinary Members of ^Council are necessarily officers in the Army.14. In discussing the progress of expenditure, the Commission point out that, Para. 115 -out of a total increase of Rx. 19,1J7,000 in the net charge, from 1801-02 to 1895-96, no less than Hx. 13,827,000 was caused by the fall in exchange ; but they appear to attach importance to the consideration that the exchange value of the rupee at the paras beginning of the period was le^s than two shillings.   This, however, takes no notice and 2! of the fact that, whatever form of the accounts be adopted, the number of rupees added to the expenditure cannot be thereby reduced.   In bringing the calculation to a later date, the Minority Report mentions the satisfactory circumstance that the rise of Page 172. -exchange to about Wd. the rupee has improved the financial position by nearly5,000,000 a year.15. In discussing the subject of Debt, the Commission show that the amount iborrowed during the period of their investigation has been largely exceeded by the outlay on productive works, with the result that the capital of the Ordinary or unproductive Debt was in 35 years reduced by about 21 per cent., the charge for p.u.a 129, interest by 16 ner cent., and the annual burthen on the taxpayer, after deducting receipts, by 32 per cent.10. The Commission suggest that the ordinary debt may be still further reduced Para. 129. by increasing the provision for famine relief and assurance. The proposal made in your Excellency^ Letter, dated the 31st of August 1890, No. 309, which was approved in my Despatch of the 1-lth of December, No. 212, has in some degree met this recommendation, since it is now agreed that in the Budget the amount of at least I.,000,000/. shall ordinarily be taken as the grant for Famine Relief and Insurance.17. The remarks of the Commission regarding the progress of the expenditure-are, 011 the whole, highly satisfactory, especially in reference to the irrigation works pUra.I93.and the commercial railways.   In touching on the civil services, they suggest that a para. 200.larger sum might be spent in promoting the welfare of the people, a view emphasised para 157j in the Minority Report, which, however, questions the accuracy of the view taken asto the elasticity of the revenue.   It will, of course, have on each occasion to be paras 43 to- carefully considered whether the interests of the people will be more promoted by a 47. free expenditure on beneficial objects or by a remission of taxation.18. In this section of the Report there are some minor suggestions, as to the Para. 151. method of charging the salaries of chaplains employed on military service, the stores Para. 163. for stationery and printing supplied to the several departments, the charge for Paras. 166 furlough allowances, the savings banks, and the loss 011 the purely military lines of and 353. railway. The suggestion that larger sums might perhaps be devoted to the improve- Para. 200. ment of the railways was already under my consideration.19. In various passages the Commission urge that actuarial calculations should Paras. 170 be made as to the proportion borne by the non-effective to the effective charge ; but I j^81&apos; ftni -doubt whether it would lie worth while to undertake such an enquiry, inasmuch as privileges already granted cannot be withdrawn, so that the finances could not be materially benefited for a quarter of a century,&apos;while during that period the aimounce-ineut of an intention to curtail them would detract from the popularity of the Service. Moreover, I see&apos;no reason to think that economy would be promoted by adopting the
Para, 208,Pava. 53.Para. 69.Para. 307.Para. 308. Para. 317.English system of superannuation ; and, considering the lengthy investigation of the subject of the Military Funds by the Select Committee in 1871-73, I see no advantage in re-opening the discussion.20. A large part of the Report is devoted to the progress of the military ex-peudiluro; but the only specific recommendation, beyond those to which I have already referred, is that it should be ascertained whether the compensation granted to native soldiers for clearness of provisions is not larger than is needed merely to countervail a real increase in price. This subject was considered in 181)5, in connection with tlie increase of the pay of the Native Army.21. The Commission refer to the supposed inconvenience arising from the Budget Statement being made before the close of the year preceding that to which it primarily relates, for which they say that the completed account often varies considerably from the Revised Estimate; and they suggest that the financial year should end on the 31st of December. I am aware that complaint is often made that confusion is caused through the Financial Statement dealing with tlie figures for three years ; but .1 think that this is exaggerated, since the closed accounts occupy merely one or two sentences. Moreover, the differences in India between the Revised Estimate and tho Account have in recent years not averaged more than about one per thousand, as will be seen from.the table in the margin ; and even if&apos; there is a small depar-ture from the ex pec tat ion that certain transactions would occur before or after the 31st of March, the variations are not sufficient to affect the li nan c i a 1 policv of the Budget,   TheEnglish system of basing the statement on the revenue received in the Central Exchequer, and the imprests therefrom to the spending departments, is not suited to the circumstances of India. A proposal thus to alter the date on which the official year should end was considered by the Government of India in 1870, and by the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1873, and it was then decided not to make such a change.22. For the determination of the question in what cases Indian revenues may properly he charged with the payment of troops employed out of India, the Commission recommend the adoption of a geographical basis, on conditions to be specified in a formal minute defining the cases in which India should be considered to have a direct and substantial interest in the Service ; and, in the event of the two Governments being unable to agree on that point, the Commission suggest the appointment of a committee of arbitration. They further recommend that other cases in which a difference of opinion arises should be referred to the arbitrament of some person of judicial position, who should decide thereon without reference to questions of policy.23. I shall be glad to receive the opinion of your Government on the several points discussed, by the Commission.I have, &amp;c.j (Signed)     George Hamilton.	Revenue.

No. 4.Despatch from the Secretary of State for India to the Government of India, No. 117 (Financial), dated bth July 1901.I have considered in Council your Excelleticy&apos;s letter, dated the 6th of June, No. 178 ; and I do not doubt that, when the time comes for a revision of the payment to the War Office for Army Effective Services in England, the views expressed by your Government will be duly borne in. mind.2. With regard to the third paragraph of your letter, your Excellency&apos;s Govern-ment will no doubt bear in mind what I mentioned in the second paragraph of my Despatch of the 18th October 1900 ; namely, that although the mode of giving relief to India which has been adopted by His Majesty&apos;a Government is not in all respects identical with that which was recommended by the Royal Commission, and although this particular recommendation as to the cost of the India Office has not been acted upon, the total amount of relief to be actually received by India from the ImperialNo. 3.Letter from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India, \To. 178 (Finance and Commerce Department), dated Simla, the (Jth June 1901.We have the honour to refer to your Lordship&apos;s Despatch No. 178 (Financial), dated the 18th October 1900, regarding the decision of the Imperial Government on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure respecting the apportionment of the Home (marges. We observe that this decision will relieve the Indian revenues of a sum amounting, approximately, to 257,0001 per annum.2. We will not trouble your Lordship with a detailed examination of the various items in respect of which relief has been, or in our opinion ought to have been, accorded, as we recognise that the question must be taken as settled until the time comes for the revision of the capitation rate on which the Indian Military charges are calculated. But we desire at the same time to record our opinion that the relief given to the Indian revenues, glad though we are to receive it, falls far short of according to India the just and liberal treatment which was claimed for her. We would observe in particular that due weight has not been given to the considerations discussed in paras. 318 to 339 of the Commission^ Report, and to the very forcible arguments in Mr. T. lv. Btichanan&apos;s minute of &quot; Reservation.&quot; Ami we trust that, when the time comes for revising the existing arrangements, further relief will be pressed for to the extent indicated by Mr. Buchanan ; in urging this recpiest, we desire to invite special attention to the recommendations of the Commission in para. 339 and in the concluding sentences of para. 363 of their Report.3. At the present moment we will only invite your Lordship^ attention to one of the recommendations of the Commission, viz., that the Home Government should contribute 50,000i. a year towards the cost of the India Office. We entirely concur with the members of the Royal Commission in thinking it inequitable that the whole charge of the India Office should be borne by Indian revenues, and we feel that we have a strung claim to the very moderate contribution which they advocated. Your Lordship did not press this claim ou the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury, and we understand that objection has been taken on political grounds to the making of a grant by an annual vote of Parliament. Such objection does not, however, appeal&apos; to us to apply to the alternative method suggested by the Royal Commission itself, viz., to make the contribution a charge upon the Consolidated Fund ; and, unless there are valid reasons against such a step which we have not foreseen, we regard it as an act of justice to which we are reasonably entitled.We have, &amp;c, (Signed)     Oitrzox.A.

No. 5.Letter from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India, No. 300 (Finance and Commerce Department), dated Sinda, 19/7/ September 1901,We have the honour to reply to your Lordship^ Despatch No. J 91, of 1st November f000, regarding the Report of the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expenditure of India.2. In Despatch No. 178, of Oth June 1901, we have made remarks on the decisions respecting the apportionment of the Home Charges, to which your Lordship refers in para. 2. While recognising that the question is settled for the time, we observed that the relief given to the Indian Revenues falls far short of according to India the just and liberal treatment which was claimed for her, and in particular that due weight had not been given to the considerations discussed in paras. 318 to 339 of the Report, and to the very forcible arguments in Mr. T. R. Buchanan&apos;s minute of &apos;* Reservation &quot; ;* and we expressed the hope that, when the time comes for revising the existing arrangements, further relief should be pressed for to the extent indicated by Mr. Buchanan. In Despatch No. 117, of 5th July, your Lordship has stated that, when the time comes for a revision of the payment to the War Office, our views will be borne in mind. We propose now to deal with the less important matters discussed in the remaining paragraphs of your Despatch.3. Para. 4. We have noticed with great satisfaction the conclusion of the Commission in respect of the financial machinery of the&apos;Government of India, that the system in India is theoretically complete, so far as regulations can establish a sound financial control.4. Para. 5. We concur in your Lordship&apos;s opinion that it is not desirable to adopt the proposal of some Members of the Commission that the Comptroller and Auditor-General in India should be detached from and made independent of the Government.5. Para. 6. With reference to the suggestion in para. 87 of the Report that a uniform rule should be established for the record of objections and queries that arise in the course of audit, we beg to- invite attention to Chapter 47 and Articles 1704, 1705, and 1706 in Chapter 80 of the Civil Account Code, to Chapter 40 of the Military Account Code, and to paras. 1056-1(567 in Chapter XIII. of the Public Works Code, Volume I. It will be seen that a complete record of objections is maintained in all the audit offices, and that the objections are communicated to the officers whom they concern. We do not think that any change in this respect is required.But, to ensure that all points which require consideration by the Comptroller and Auditor-General or the Government are brought to notice, we propose to issue instructions that the Deputy Auditors-General when making their inspections shall specially report on the objection hooks of each office, and bring to&apos; notice any interpretations of rules which appear to them doubtful.In our Despatch No. 222, of 4th July 1901, we requested, and in Despatch No. 140, of Oth August .1901, your Lordship accorded sanction to an increase to the strength of the Civil Accounts Department, the main reason being that tbe existing strength has been found to be insufficient to admit of the continuous employment of the two Deputy Auditors-General on their work of inspection and test audit. We think it very desirable that that important work should never be interrupted.Exchequer will nevertheless he fully equal to the total amount suggested by the Commission.3. The views on this subject which arc now again put forward in your Excellency&apos;s letter were very fully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government; but they, while consenting to the arrangement which gives to India the full amount of relief proposed by the Royal Commission, declined to admit any claim which would have had the effect of raising it materially beyond that sum.1 have, d&apos;c%, (Signed)     G eokg r Ha .m i tton&apos; .
0. Para. 7. In para. 90 of the Report the Commission state that they think it would be well if the appropriation accounts of Indian expenditure, and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor-General thereon, followed the form of those which the Comptroller and Auditor-General of the United Kingdom presents to the House of Commons. The Commission do not specify any points in respect of which the form now in use is defective or unsuitable. The only reason given by them is that the Home form has been found suitable for the accounts of the United Kingdom. We are of opinion that in making this suggestion the Commission have not allowed due weight to the great differences between the circumstances of India and the United Kingdom, which they have mentioned and recognised in other parts of the Report, The accounts of the United Kingdom are much simpler than those of India. There the accounts are those of a few centralised departments, all of which draw their funds from one central Exchequer ; and the appropriation accounts and reports are separate for each department. In India the accounts are those of upwards of 260 treasuries, and of several departments; there are separate grants for each officer who draws funds from each treasury, and transfers are frequently made of grants from one district to another; audit officers have constantly to deal with payments made on account of a department of which the audit is conducted by another officer, and they exchange accounts current relating to these payments. Moreover, as the Commission remark in para. 83, the system of audit in England is highly centralised, while in India it is to a great extent local and decentralised. All these circumstances render the adoption of the English form unsuitable for India. If it were adopted, the amount of the detailed figures would have to be enormously increased beyond that which is now given, without, as far as we can see, attaining any really useful result; it would be impossible to have one single report for all Indians at present; each Province and each Department would require a separate report. The bulk of the present report is sufficiently serious, though it condenses the provincial and departmental reports into about one-third of their original size ; if the change suggested were made, the bulk of the aggregate of the several reports would be many times greater, and would render them unmanageable for practical use. Moreover, the adoption of the English form would involve the omission of the comparisons of the accounts with the revised estimates of the year and with the accounts of the preceding year; these have hitherto been regarded as an important part of the annual report, and we do not think that they should be given up.7. If your Lordship considers it desirable, we might, while refraining from the introduction of the radical changes which the adoption of the Commission^ suggestion would involve, make one step in the direction in which they apparently desire to move. At present the Appropriation Report gives full particulars of the audit against grants ; it states the sanctioned and unsanctioned excesses over grants; but it does not give particulars of the results of the rest of the audit. It might without objection, if your Lordship thinks it expedient, show also the amounts objected to (1) for want of sufficient vouchers, and (2) for want of due sanction to the expenditure, and the amounts under these two heads which have subsequently been admitted in the course of the year, with brief explanations of the nature of the outstanding amounts.   Beyond this we do not think it advisable to go.8. In para. 90 the Commission also suggest that the Appropriation Report should embody the result of the test audits. We have hitherto considered the reports of Deputy Auditors-General on the inspection of the various offices as confidential documents for the information of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Govern-ment, and the officers whom they concern. We incline to think that this view should be adhered to, and that the results of the inspections should not be made public.9. Paras. 8, 9 and 10. In para. 91 of, the Report the Commission suggest the submission of the Accounts and Reports to a Standing Committee, some of the members of which are to be unconnected with the India Office, wrhose report would be laid before Parliament. We concur with your Lordship and with Sir A. Scoble . and Sir R. Mowbray in deprecating the adoption of this suggestion, on the ground that it would tend to diminish the responsibility of the Government of India and the Secretary of State, and to impose upon Parliament a greater degree of supervision than it now exercises.10. Paras. 11 and 12. We also agree with your Lordship that the existing constitutional procedure affords the Finance and other Members of Council sufficient opportunity for laying their views unreservedly before the Secretary of State.   Under3637 13
that procedure it would be open to the Finance Member at any time to record a minute, making general remarks on financial questions, to be forwarded under cover of a Despatch, with or without observations by other Members of Council.11. Para. 13. With regard to the remarks of the Commission in para. 08 as to the supposed preponderance of the military element in the Council of the Governor-General in consequence of the presence in it of both the Commander-in-Chief and the Military Member, it is not our experience that any inconvenience or prejudice has arisen from this course, and there would therefore appear to be no present need for making a change in this respect. On the contrary, the presence of the executive as well as of the administrative head of the army at our deliberations tends, in our opinion, to the due representation of two distinct aspects of Military questions ; while the Civilian element in Council is sufficiently strong to ensure that it is not overborne by the weight of an exclusively Military vote.12. Paras. 15 and 16. In para. 129 of the Report the Commission, with reference to the considerable reduction which has been effected in the ordinary debt, say that it is a question whether tho time has not come when a modest portion of the saving in the interest charge might not be specifically devoted to the further reduction of debt. They desire to create a reserve fund, to be available in great emergencies without adding to the public burdens ; they show that the *&apos; New Sinking Fund &quot; of the United Kingdom is a reserve of this character; they state that the Indian Famine Insurance grant is a reserve somewhat similar in nature ; and they explain that their suggestion means that that grant should be increased so far as is consistent with sound finance, and made permanent like Oie &quot; New Sinking Fund &quot; at Home.13. The adoption of this proposal would require us to maintain taxation in ordinary years at a higher level than is required to meet the expenditure, in order to have for general purposes a reserve which would enable us in years of emergency to meet increased expenditure without further&apos; increasing taxation ; the surplus thus maintained being devoted in ordinary years to the reduction or avoidance of debt. In our opinion the circumstances of India would not justify this policy. We think that we should be content with the reduction in the ordinary interest charge which is being steadily effected by the devotion to the construction of reproductive railways and irrigation works of sums in excess of our annual borrowings, that excess being-provided mainly from receipts like the Savings Banks deposits, and also by the utilisation of the Revenue surplus in any year in which a surplus is secured. The pressure of taxation in India is sufficiently heavy to render it inexpedient deliberately to maintain taxes which are not required in ordinary years, in order to provide a reserve for general purposes to be available in any possible future emergency ; such a policy is doubtless fully justified in the United Kingdom, but it will be piany years before the pressure of taxation in India is so light as to justify its adoption in India. In para. 17 of your Despatch your Lordship refers to the opinion of the Commission, emphasised in the Minority Report, that larger expenditure on certain beneficial objects is desirable, and remarks that it will on each occasion have to be considered whether the interests of the people will be more promoted by such expenditure or by a remission of taxation. The existence of these demands for useful expenditure constitutes another reason why we should not earmark any portion of our existing resources as a sinking fund or reserve to provide against future general emer-gencies.14. The foregoing remarks are not intended in any way to call in question the policy of making specific provision in ordinary years against future famines, the policy to which the annual provision of the Famine Insurance grant was designed to give effect. It is true that the general arguments above stated might be held to militate even against that policy; but experience has shown that the periodical recurrence of famine at varying intervals is so certain that the expenditure involved must over a long period be held to be ordinary expenditure, and it is therefore right that provision should be made for it regularly even in the intervening years, and should not be left to be made only in the years of famine.The Commission realise, what we have pointed out in para. 5 of our Despatch No. 232, of 11th July 1901, that, under the orders hitherto in force, the provision against famine operates only by strengthening our general resources, and is in fact a general reserve available for all future emergencies, and not only for famine; and they suggest an increase of the Famine Insurance grant as a means of increasing
that general reserve. In the Despatch just quoted we have stated our opinion that it is desirable to make the Famine insurance an insurance specifically against famine, and have made proposals with that object, one of which is that the amounts hitherto devoted to the avoidance of debt should be invested in securities to he sold as required to enable us to meet the cash outlay on famine wdien it occurs. We are opposed to an increase of the Famine Insurance grant above the amount required to provide against famine, and we think that the amount of 1,000,000/. fixed by the orders quoted in para. .10 of your Lordship^ Despatch is sufficient.15. Para, 18. With reference to the remark of the Commission in para. 15.1 &quot; that all chaplains employed on military service should be paid from the Army grants,&quot; we may explain that, when chaplains of the Church of Scotland or Roman Catholic priests are attached to particular regiments, their salary and allowances are charged under the head &quot;Army.&quot; Other chaplains are not attached to regiments, and they are not engaged solely in ministering to soldiers ; their duties are as much or more concerned with the civil population; and it has long been the practice to charge their cost on the civil estimates. We do not understand the Commission to propose that this practice should he changed ; it is in our opinion the most statable. In deference to the recommendation of the Commission, we have ordered the charge to &quot;Army,&quot; instead of to the civil head &quot;Ecclesiastical,&quot; of the capitation and travelling allowances payable under Articles 007, 007 A., B., and C, of the Civil Service Regulations ; these charges are incurred solely for ministration to soldiers.10. Para. 18.-We shall give instructions to adopt the recommendation of the Commission in para. 1G3 to add a note in the Finance and Revenue Accounts, showing the expenditure on stationery and printing on account of each department.17. Para. 18. We also approve the suggestion in para. 16G of the Report to add a note or notes in the Finance and Revenue Accounts, showing the charge of furlough allowances paid in England for the different services. We request that your Lordship will give instructions to have the necessary information sent to our Comptroller and Auditor-General.18. Para. 18. In para. 353 the Commission write regarding Savings Banks:   &quot; The cost of managing the banks is included in Post Office expenditure, but the &quot; department is not credited with any part of the profit made on the investment of &quot; the moneys deposited in the banks. We think that the Savings Bank branch &quot; should be debited with all its expenses and credited with all its earnings.&quot; The deposits are not invested, they are merely used to enable us to reduce our annual loans, and are in fact special borrowings at the rate of interest, at present 3J per cent., paid on them. The interest paid is charged, not to the Post Office, but to the head &quot; Interest on other Obligations.&quot; The cost of managing the banks is charged to the Post Office, because that work is done for the most part by the ordinary postal establishments which do the other work of the Post Office; an estimate only could be made of the cost of managing the Savings Banks. For these reasons the suggestion of the Commission could not be carried out in the accounts without introducing into them elements of surmise quite out of place in documents which ought to record only actual facts. But an estimate such as the Commission desire might be made in the annual report of the Post Office; it might show, on the one side, interest on the balance of the deposits at some assumed rate, which might for the present be 31 per cent., and, on the other side, the actual payments of interest to depositors, and an estimate of the cost of managing the banks.19. Para. 18.-In para. 198 (3) and para. 200 the Commission suggest that the loss incurred on purely military lines of railway should be charged as military expenditure, instead of in the Railway Revenue Accounts, and that the results of protective railways should be shown separately (though apparently under the Railway Revenue Account) from those of commercial railways. This is an important suggestion, which would require careful consideration and working out in detail before it could be adopted. There is great convenience in treating all railways alike in the accounts, whatever may have been the motives which led to their construction ; and some railways constructed mainly on strategic grounds, and many railways constructed mainly as a protection against famine, attain in time distinct commercial success. Moreover, it would not be easy to formulate the distinction in practice, since all railways yield some return. But it is certainly true that the accounts would give a more favourable and more correct view of the commercial results of railwaysJ3 2
constructed mainly as commercial undertakings, if the proposal of the Commission were adopted. And, if your.Lordship approves the suggestion, we shall be prepared to submit proposals to give effect to it. Hut perhaps the object would be attained more conveniently, and the results brought more prominently to the notice of the public, if, while the accounts are left unchanged, a paragraph is inserted every year in the Financial Statement and in the Railway Administration Report, distributing the result of the Railway Revenue Account between the three classes of railways,20. In clause 2 of para, 108 the Commission express the opinion that the interest charge of 4 per cent, to the Railway Revenue Account is excessive, as India borrows money at a much cheaper rate. This question has been discussed in the correspondence ending with your Lordship&apos;s Despatch No. 70 (Financial) of 5th April 1001, and the charge has been reduced to of per cent, in respect of capital expended on the construction of railways and irrigation works after April 1900.21. Para. 19. We concur with your Lordship that it is not worth while to have actuarial calculations made as to the proportion borne by the non-elfective to the effective charge. We do not think that such an inquiry would result in a reduction of the pension charges.22. Para. 20. With reference to the Commission^ remark in para. 208, regarding the compensation to Native troops for clearness of provisions, we beg to refer to our Military Despatch No. 98, of 27th June 1901.23. Para. 21.- With regard to the Commission&apos;s suggestion that the financial year should end on 31st December instead of on 31st March, we may first say that a change of this nature gives rise to trouble and inconvenience in many ways, and should not be made unless it is clear that the advantages will be very great indeed, and the disadvantages, apart from the trouble and inconvenience, insignificant. If, as proposed, the year ended in December, and the Budget Estimate continued to be passed in March, there would be one very serious disadvantage, which we consider would in itself be sufficient to lead to the rejection of the proposal. The grants within which the spending authorities have to confine their expenditure are fixed by the Budget Estimate: these grants ought to be settled before the new year begins, and much confusion would result if the limits of expenditure were not made known to the spending authorities till one quarter of the year had elapsed. If the date for the close of the year were altered to December, we should consider it necessary for the above reason to pass the Budget Estimates in that month ; but this would defeat the object of the Commission in suggesting the change, which is to avoid having Revised Estimates of a year, as well as the Budget Estimates and the YVctuals. More-over, that object would not be attained by the adoption of the suggestion. Under the Indian system the Estimates and Accounts deal with actual revenue and expenditure, instead of, as in the United Kingdom, with exchequer receipts from and issues to departments. This system the Commission pronounce to be sound, though slower than the English system. Under it, it would be impossible to present in March the final actuals of a year ending on 31st December. The accounts of a year cannot be finally closed till more than three months after the last day of it. It would therefore be necessary to have Revised Estimates for the year. The differences between them and the finally recorded actuals would be less than at present. But, as your Lordship shows, those differences have in recent years been small, and not sufficient to affect the financial policy of the Budget.24. Para. 22. We are willing to accept the proposals made in paras. 307, 308, and 317 of the Report, to aid in the settlement of questions whether India should bear any portion of the cost of troops employed outside India, subject to the following suggestions regarding two of the heads of the Minnte set forth in para. 307.In head No. 2 we suggest the insertion; after the word &quot; India,&quot; of the following-words : &quot; in common with other outlying portions of the British Empire to which maritime access is gained by way of the Suez Canal.&quot; We think it should be recognised that the interest of India is of the same nature as that of other countries served by-the Canal.We also suggest that in head No. 9, regarding China and the Malay Peninsula, the words &quot; may have &quot; should be substituted for &quot; has &quot; ; and we would desire to lay stress upon the opinion that Indian interests in China are almost exclusively confined to Western and South-Western China, i.e., to regions contiguous to the frontier parts of Burma.   We do not find in the maintenance of the opium trade a sufficient ground
for recognising the existence of a special Indian concern in the treaty-ports of China, still less in the diplomacy of Peking, in our opinion the latter is au international concern ; and we therefore received with lively satisfaction the intimation conveyed to us in the enclosures to your Lordship&apos;s Despatch of 18th October 1900, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have consented from April last to forego the charge of 12,500/. a year for China establishments hitherto borne upon the Indian revenues. The verbal amendment above suggested appears to us to be the logical corollary of the decision thus arrived at.We have, &amp;c,(Signed)     Ourzox.A. P. P. Palmer. C. M, Rivaz. T, Raleigh. E. FG.

Despatch to India, 1st November 1900, No. 191. Letter from India, 0th June 1901, No. 178. Despatch to India, 5th July 1901, No. 117. Letter from India, 19th September 1901, No. 300.In forwarding this correspondence, I am desired to request the special attention -of their Lordships to the 307th paragraph of the Report of the Commission, in which they make suggestions on which a Treasury minute should, in their opinion, be founded, for regulating the allocation of cost in connection with the employment beyond India of troops borne on the Indian establishment.With slight modifications mentioned in the 24th para, of the last letter, the Government of India are willing to accept the proposals of the Commission, coupled with the recommendation in para. 308, for the appointment of a Committee to advise in reference to such questions ; and they also concur in the suggestion in para. 317 for the submission to arbitration of disputes as to administrative charges between the India Office as representing the interests of India on the one hand, and departments of the Government of the United Kingdom, on the other.Lord George Hamilton agrees with the Royal Commission and with the Government of India in the desirability of adopting this method of bringing to a speedy decision questions of this nature. He is, moreover, of opinion that such matters should be treated in a strictly judicial spirit; and that the most competent and suitable arbitrators will, as a rule, be found among such high legal authorities^, for instance, the Lords of Appeal or other members of the High Court of Judicature, who are accustomed to deal with intricate questions of conflicting claims, supported by documentary evidence, and to decide them with absolute impartiality.He hopes that this proposal, to which he attaches much importance, may, as well as those previously set forth, commend itself to the Lords Commissioners of the &quot;Treasury.I have, &amp;c, (Signed)     Horace Walpole.
No. 7.Letter from, the Treasury to the India Office, No. 18156/01, dated29th November 1901.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have had before them Sir Horace Walpole&apos;s letter (F. COT 7) of the 5th instant, with its enclosures, relative to paras. 307, 308, and 317 of the Final Report from the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expenditure of India, and I am to request you to lay the following reply before the Secretary of State for India in Council :-I. Para. 317. My Lords are in accord with Lord George Hamilton in attaching much importance to the speedy settlement by arbitration of disputes between the Imperial and Indian Governments regarding administrative charges, and they readily accept his Lordship&apos;s suggestion that the most competent and suitable arbitrators will, as a rule, be found among high legal authorities. My Lords will accordingly be glad if the Secretary of State will take steps to secure the services of one of His Majesty&apos;s Judges to act m a standing arbitrator. It will probably be well that the Lord Chancellor should be communicated with about the appointment.II. Para. 307. As regards the payment of troops employed in military operations beyond the external frontiers of India, the Royal Commission, desiring to indicate the lines on which such payments should be apportioned between the Imperial and Indian Governments, recommend the adoption of a principle of (jeograpliicat distribution of charge, and advise that; this principle should be applied so as to provide:  &quot; (1) That India has not a direct and substantial interest in the employment of forces in Europe ; in Africa, west of the Cape of Good Hope ; in Asia, east of China.&quot; (2) That India has a direct and substantial interest in keeping open the Suez &apos; Canal, and in the maintenance of order and established government in Egypt so far as the security of the Suez Canal is affected thereby. This interest might extend to the coasts ol the Red Sea only so far as to maintain the inviolability of that shore, but not to the Soudan, or further extensions of Egypt up the valley of the Nile or its affluents.&quot; (3) That India may have a modified interest, in questions affecting the east coast of Africa as far as Zanzibar, and the African islands in the Indian Ocean, except Madagascar.&quot; (4) That India has no direct or substantial interest in the African coast seutli of Zanzibar.&quot; (5) That India has a direct and substantial interest in questions affecting Persia, and the coast and islands of Arabia and of the Persian Gulf.&quot; (6) That India has a direct and substantial interest in questions affecting Afghanistan and that part of Central Asia which is adjacent to the borders of India or Afghanistan.&quot; (7) That India has sole interest in punitive expeditions on her borders.&quot; (8) That India has a direct and substantial interest in. questions affecting Siam.&quot; (9) That India has a modified interest in questions affecting China and the Malay Peninsula.&quot; (10) That India has no direct or substantial interest in Japan or countries or islands east and south of China.&quot; (11) That special cases may arise giving to India a direct and substantial interest in questions connected with Europe or other territories in which the Minute declares her to have, as a general rule, no interest.&quot; (12) That, in every case where the two Governments are not agreed, no contri-bution should be made by India until the sanction of Parliament has been obtained.&quot;My Lords consider that these recommendations afford in principle a sound basis of allocation of charge between the two Governments, and they hereby concur therein.
No. 8.Letter from the India Office to the Treasury, No. F. 7225, dated22nd January 1902.I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 29th of November, No. 18150, and to say that the Secretary of State in Council accepts the views therein expressed regarding the reference to arbitration of matters in which differences of opinion may arise between the Imperial and the Indian Governments as to the division of administrative charges.His Lordship considers that the arbitrator should, if possible, be one of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary; and, after communicating with the Lord Chancellor, he will propose a name for the concurrence of the Lords Commissioners.With regard to questions connected with the employment of troops on the Indian Establishment in operations beyond the frontiers of India, Lord George Hamilton does not propose to press the adoption of the recommendation of the Royal Commission in para. 308 of their Report, with regard to the appointment of a Committee in certain.Their Lordships do not think it advisable or desirable to modify the Royal &quot;Commission&apos;s recommendations in the manner suggested by the Government of India, viz.: (i) To insert after the word &quot;India,&quot; in head 2 above, the words &quot;in common&quot; with other outlying portions of the British Empire to which maritime &quot; access is gained by way of the Suez Canal &quot; ; and(ii) To substitute &quot; may have &quot; for &quot; has &quot; in head 9.As regards (i), the object of the detailed heads is to set forth the interests of India and of India alone, and My Lords think that the recital should not he complicated, even under a single head, by including reference to other portions of the British Empire,As regards (ii), reference to the correspondence of last year, with regard to the apportionment of Indian Home Charges, will show that the Government of India is in error in thinking that His Majesty&apos;s Government have consented simply &quot; to forego &quot;the charge of 12,500/. a year for China Establishments, hitherto borne upon the &quot;Indian revenues.&quot; (Vide Lord George Hamilton&apos;s Despatch of 18th October 1900, Financial, No. 178, and para. 2-1 o of the Royal Commission^ Report.) As the Secretary of State in Council is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government did not decide to forego the charge, though the specific contribution of 12,500/. a year by India has been set off against larger payments to India, with a view solely to simplification of accounts. This having been the decision, the proposed verbal amendment can hardly stand.If, as My Lords hope, the above views meet with the concurence of the Secretary of State in Council, his Lordship will perhaps agree that if will be desirable, if and when he has obtained the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the foregoing-arrangements, to present the correspondence to Parliament as embodying the compact between the two Governmenfs. My Lords do not see that any advantage would be gained in adopting the form of a Treasury Minute, as suggested by the Royal Commission.III. Para. 308 deals with, a proposed Committee to investigate cases of inter-departmental disagreement as to the application of the foregoing principles with regard to the payment of troops out of India. But the Royal Commission itself recognises, in para. 303 of the Report, that the &quot; final authority determining the &quot; relative interests of the United Kingdom, and India, must reside in the Home &quot; administration, and in the Parliament which supports it with its confidence &quot; ; and, concurring in this expression of opinion, My Lords for their part fail to see how, in such cases of disagreement on large questions of Imperial policy, it would be possible tospermit any outside Committee to be created for the purpose of reporting, through His Majesty&apos;s Government, to Parliament, its opinion on matters which must in any case be decided by the responsible Government.I am, &amp;c., (Signed)     Fbancis Mowatt.
cases, if it may be understood that, in the event of a disagreement between the Lords-Commissioners of the Treasury and the Secretary of State for India in Council, the-arguments which have been advanced on either side as to the apportionment of expenditure, including the views of the Government of India, will be laid before Parliament before anv final decision is arrived at. The Lords Commissioners will remember that this course was followed in 189G in connection with the Mombassa and the Soudan expeditions.I am to add that Lord George Hamilton concurs hi the suggestion that copies of this correspondence be presented to Parliament as embodying the compact between the two Governments.I have, &amp;c, (Signed)      A. Godlev.No. 9.Despatch from the Secretary of Stale for India lo the Government of India, No. IG (Financial), dated 21th January 1002.On receipt of Your Excellency^ letter, dated the 19th of September, No. 300, regarding the Report of the Royal Commission on the Administration of the Expendi-agriculture of India, I at once communicated with His 1901* T0 Treasu,y&apos; datetl 51,1 Nov6mber  Majesty&apos;s Treasury respecting the important From ditto, dated 29th November 1901.  subjects to which the last paragraph of your To ditto, dated 22nd January 1902.      letter related ;  and I enclose a copy of the correspondence^&apos; that has ensued.2. Your Excellency will observe that it has been agreed that a standing arbitrator shall be appointed, of high legal authority, to whom any disputes may be referred if they should arise between the Imperial and Indian Governments regarding admini-strative charges. On the other hand, you will observe that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are of opinion that there is no advantage in the appointment of a Joint Committee to consider and report on cases where the British Government and the Government of India differ, on the question whether the direct and substantial interest of India in military operations on which Indian troops are employed beyond the frontiers of India is such as to justify the expenditure of Indian revenues thereon. Your Excellency will observe the terms in which, after carefully considering the matter, I have replied to the Treasury on this point.3. In making their recommendation, the Royal Commission proposed that the&apos; principle of geographical distribution should be adopted as affording fair primd facie ground for the allocation of the cost. Your Excellency was desirous that in two&apos; particulars the language adopted by the Commission should be modified ; but, in view of the advantage of accepting its suggestions on this branch of the subject without demur, and of the objection taken by the Treasury to any modification, 1 have not pressed your views further. It appears to me the less necessary to do so, because, if it is admitted that India may be in some measure interested in the protection of the Suez Canal or in military operations in China, it must rest in all such cases with the Government of the day to determine to what extent it should be proposed to Parliament that the charge should be borne by Indian revenues.4. With reference to the other recommendations which were made by the Royal Commission, I concur generally in the opinions expressed in your letter of the 19th of September.&quot; But there are one or two passages on which it is necessary for me to comment.5 In dealing with the subject of the Appropriation Accounts, Your Excellency intimates a readiness, if I think it expedient, to direct that such reports should give particulars showing how far objections were taken for want of sufficient vouchers or for want of due sanction to the expenditure, and the amounts subsequently admitted, with, brief explanations of the nature of the amounts outstanding. The matter is one which I am disposed to leave to the judgment of your Government; I do not, however, think that the public, for whose information the Report is compiled, would take any interest in the subject; and, so long as the existing audit rules are maintained, which ensure that any expenditure for which the Secretary of State&apos;s sanction is required
No. 10.Letter from the Treasury to the India Office, No. 1312, datedHth February 1902.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have had before them your letter (F. 7225) of the 22nd ultimo, further with regard to the apportionment of charges between the Imperial and Indian Governments, from which they are glad to learn that the Secretary of State for [ndia in Council is in accord with this Board, on the subject of administrative charges, and will not press for the reference to a Committee of possible cases of inter-departmental disagreement with regard to the incidence of cost of troops employed out of India.The consent of both Houses of Parliament is requisite under section 55 of the Act 21 &amp; 22 Viet. cap. 106, before Indian revenues can be made applicable to defray (except in connection with invasion or urgent necessity) the cost of military operations by Indian troops outside Indian frontiers ; but my Lords are unable to concur in the suggestion that the correspondence should be laid before Parliament before any final decision is arrived at in cases involving inter-departmental disagreement.3637 oshall be brought to his notice, 1 am unwilling to impose further burdens on the Accounting Officers.0. On the question of the Famine Insurance, to which para. 11 of your letter relates, I have addressed you in a Despatch dated the 10th of January, No. 4.7. In para, 17 you express approval of the suggestion of the Commission that a note should be inserted in the Finance and Revenue Accounts, showing the charge of the civil furlough allowances paid in England for the different services; and you request me to issue the requisite instructions. To a certain extent already the furlough allowances of special departments are separately shown, namely, the Indian and the Indo-European Telegraph, the Public Works Department (military and civil being separated), the Bengal Pilot Service, and the Royal Indian Marine. Your proposal, therefore, relates to the absentee pay now shown in the accounts under (1) the Indian Civil Service, (2) military officers in civil employ, (3) the uneovenanted service. To carry this into effect, it would be necessary for your accounting officers on every pay certificate to notify the proportion in which the furlough allowance ought to be divided between the executive and the judicial branches, together with ether Departments, such as General Administration, Political, Accounts, Post Office, Mint, Law., (vc. To make every officers furlough allowance a charge of the department to which he happened to be attached when the leave was granted would obviously be no improvement in the direction of accurate accounting ; and any rules for the distribution of the charge among two or more departments must be of a technical and general character, and would not result in any better elucidation of the actual cost of each, department than the present system of taking the charge to a special head. I think, therefore, that the proposal, which would involve an enormous amount of trouble, would be of very little practical use. In any case, nothing in this direction can be done in England, without the receipt of certificates from India giving the requisite information.(S. As regards para. 18, I concur in your Excellency&apos;s view that it would be out of place to insert in the Accounts an estimate of the cost of managing the Savings Banks ; but I have no objection to its being shown in the Annual Report of the Post Office.9. Similarly, 1 think that any endeavour to distinguish the financial results of purely military or protective lines of railway from those constructed for commercial or administrative reasons should not be made in the Accounts. I am doubtful whether it is practicable to draw such a distinction with accuracy, as the grounds on which it is thought desirable that a particular railway or a branch should be constructed are usually of a mixed character. But I am prepared to consider any proposals that you may submit to me, for such a classification in the Railway Administrative Report.i have, &amp;c, (Signed)     George Hamilton.
Before such a step could be taken, the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to be sought, and this decision must be final as between the India Office and the Treasury,My Lords presume that the Secretary of State will take the necessary steps to ensure the presentation of the present correspondence to Parliament.1 am, $c,, (Signed)     Fuancis Mowatt.No. 11.Letter from the India Of/ice to the Treasury, No. F. 833, dated12th March 1902.I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the l:lth of February, No. 1312, on the subject of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure.The Lords Commissioners of Ilis Majesty&apos;s Treasury will have observed that the willingness of His Lordship to acquiesce in the non-adoption of certain recommen-dations of the Commission was conditional upon the establishment of an understanding that, in the event of a disagreement arising in respect of the incidence of charges connected with tlie employment outside India of troops on the Indian establishment, the correspondence should be laid before Parliament before any final decision was formed.To this suggestion the Lords Commissioners object, on the ground that in any case involving departmental disagreement &quot;the decision of His Majesty^ Government &quot;would have to be sought, and this decision must be final as between the India Office &quot; and the Treasury.&quot;His Lordship understands these words to mean that the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, with regard to a matter entailing the imposition of a charge upon the revenues of India, must he final. If so, I am to point out that their Lordships would appear to be under a misapprehension. The decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in a matter of this kind could not be finalThe position of the Secretary of State for India differs from that of other heads of departments in this country, inasmuch as a decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government upon any point of policy or administration affecting such other departments is necessarily followed by the provision from Imperial revenues of the funds required to give effect to such decision. But no such power is exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to Indian revenues.A reference to the 41st section of the Act 21 &amp; 22 Viet. cap. 106 shows that no charge can legally he placed on the revenues of India otherwise than by the Secretary of State in Council, or without the concurrence of a majority of votes at a meeting of the Council of India. It is true that Parliament, which gave this absolute veto to the Secretary of State in Council by the Act which I have quoted, could by a new Act take it away. But in no other way could a charge be placed on Indian, revenues, either by His Majesty&apos;s Government or even by Parliament, if a majority of the Council of India were to decline to agree to it.It will be seen, therefore, that, before Indian revenues can be applied to the cost of military operations outside Indian frontiers, it is necessary to obtain (1) the assent of a majority of the Council of India, and (2) that of both Houses of Parliament under section 55 of the Act already mentioned. In practice, no doubt, the Secretary of State in Council, if he differed from the Lords Commissioners as to the apportion-ment of such expenditure between the two Treasuries, would probably modify his decision in deference to resolutions passed by both Houses of Parliament, although technically such resolutions would not be binding upon him. But, having regard to the state of the law on this subject, his Lordship thinks himself entitled to stipulate that, in the case supposed, the House of Commons shall, by the presentation of papers, be placed in possession of the facts and arguments bearing upon the question at issue, before it is asked to consider it.I am therefore directed to say that Lord George Hamilton must adhere to the condition which, in my letter of the 22nd of January, was attached to his acquiescence
in the proposal of the Lords Commissioners ; and I am to express his hope that their Lordships, on further consideration, may see their way to agree to it.I have, &amp;c, (Signed)     A. Codley.No. 12.Letter from the Treasury to the India Ojjiee, No, 4-100, dated 21th March 1902.I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury your letter (F, 833) of the 12th instant, further respecting the Report of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, and I am directed to request you to lay before the Secretary of State for India in Council the following reply.My Lords have no intention of calling in question the power imposed by Parliament on the Council of India of disallowing a charge on Indian revenues. The object of their Lordships, in expressing themselves adverse to the production to Parliament-before any final decision is arrived at of correspondence in the event of a disagreement between the Secretary of State and this Board, was to avoid a contingency by which on the one hand a corporate policy might be expounded by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Parliament, and on the other an inter-departmental conflict of views might transpire on the same subject in a Blue Book.It appears to their Lordships that a lesser evil will be the appointment, if necessary, of the Departmental Committee suggested by the Royal Commission ; and they accordingly now propose to Lord George Hamilton that this course should be adopted, should the necessity arise. It is, however, their Lordships&apos; confident hope that such necessity will not arise, seeing that the possibilities of inter-departmental diiferences are reduced to a minimum, by the fact that practical agreement has been -arrived at on almost all the conceivable cases of employment of troops outside India.I am, &amp;c, (Signed)     Austen Chamberlain.No. 13.Letter from the India Ojjiee to the Treasury, No. F. 1683, dated 16th April 1902.I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 27th of March, No. 44.09, conveying the assent of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to the appointment, if necessary, of a Departmental Committee to report on any case in which a difference of opinion may arise regarding the payment of troops on the Indian Establishment when employed outside India. Idis Lordship is much gratified to learn that the Lords Commissioners are willing to accept the recommendation of the Royal Commission on this point, and he shares their confident hope that the necessity for the appointment of such a Committee will seldom, if ever, arise.As your letter removes the last difficulty in the way of a complete agreement upon the questions raised by the Report of the Commission, I am now directed to enclose a collection showing the papers which it is proposed to lay before Parliament, in continuation of the Return 387 of Session 2 of 1900.It is requested that the collection of papers may be returned to this Office.I have, &amp;c., (Signed)     Horace Walpole.

The collection of papers is returned herewith, as requested.I am, &amp;c., (Signed)     Francis Mowatt.
