With reference to a previous memorandum (CP. 2:561) by the General Staff on     091^the external use of native troops raised in mandated territories, I circulate herewith a 2696 further memorandum by the General Staff, calling attention to the disadvantage in which we are at present placed as compared with the French, and requesting that amendments be made in the &quot; B&quot; mandates to rectify the present state of affairs.L. W.-E.The War Office,ISth March, 1921.1. In December of last year, and as soon as the General Staff became aware of the terms of the &quot; B&quot; mandates, the Secretary of State for War circulated a memorandum by the General Staff (CP. 2301), in whicli expression was given to their anxiety that (a.) No clause should be inserted in any mandate which would preclude entirely the external use of troops raised within mandated territory.(b.) There should in no circumstances be any discrimination against this country in respect of the nature of mandates granted to different nations as far as military considerations were concerned.The British position has already been safeguarded in the &quot; A &quot; mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine, but this is not so in the case of the British &quot; B &quot; mandates for African territories, and the British &quot; C &quot; mandates for German South-West Africa and islands in the Pacific. The case of the &quot; C &quot; mandates is one which concerns intimately the Dominion Governments of Australia, New Zealand, and the Government of the Union of South Africa, and the General Staff have no desire to insist on any alteration in the terms of these mandates if these Governments are satisfied.As regards the British &quot;B&quot; mandates for Africa, they desire again to draw attention to the danger which the Empire will run if the French are free to employ troops raised in their African territories outside the mandated areas, while Great Britain is forbidden to do &apos;so. The arguments for retention of similar rights to those conferred upon the French are stated in the Cabinet Paper referred to above.2. Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations in defining the different classes of mandates and speaking of the &quot; B&quot; mandates reads as follows : &quot; Other peoples especially those of Central Africa are at such a stage that the mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee.......the prevention of theestablishment of fortifications or military and naval bases, and of military training -of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory.&quot;This clause was discussed by the representatives of the British Empire, of France, America and Italy at a meeting of the Peace Congress on 30th January, 1919, and it -was agreed between Mr. Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau and President Wilson that it(B21/123)   100  3/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.  9037wo
should be interpreted to mean that troops raised in a mandated territory might be used for the defence of territory outside the mandated area. The French have inserted a specific clause to this effect in their &quot; B &quot; mandate which reads as follows : &quot; Toutefois il est entendu que les troupes aussi levees peuvent en cas de guerre g^nerale etre utilisees pour repousser une agression ou pour la defense du territoire en dehors de la region soumise au mandat.&quot;The corresponding article in our &quot; B &quot; mandates contains no such saving clause and reads  &quot; The mandatory shall......not organize any native militaryforces in the territory except for local police purposes and for the defence of the territory.&quot;The present position appears to the General Staff therefore to be that we cannot raise local forces in our &quot; B&quot; mandate areas except for the defence of the territory itself, while the French are free to raise forces and employ them anywhere.3, On 8th February, 1921, a Departmental Conference was held at the Privy Council Offices, at which Mr. Balfour stated that in his opinion there was nothing in the &quot; B&quot; mandate to preclude the military authorities from carrying out in any particular case defensive military operations involving the use of troops raised in the mandated territory, outside the borders of that territoryFinally, at a conference presided over by Mr. Balfour and attended bv Lord Curzon and Mr. Churchill on 17th February, it was decided that &quot;there was no advantage in pressing for a definite recognition of the right to use native troops raised in Africa outside that country for purposes 10! defence, and the question might be allowed to rest in its present position until some emergency arose.&quot;This last statement does not bear out the contention of Mr. Ballour at the conference of 8th February that there was nothing to preclude the military authorities from using troops raised in mandated areas outside those areas. The General Staff, on the contrary, consider that such a course is definitely precluded by the present terms of the British &quot; B&quot; mandate, which certainly will not bear the interpretation given by Mr. Lloyd George himself to the original wording of Article 22 of the Covenant of the League at the meeting of the Peace Congress referred to in paragraph 2.It is imperative to know where we stand in this matter, as adequate plans for the co-ordinated defence of the Empire cannot be prepared unless it is known what resources can be utilized. It would be fatal to await the advent of an emergency before deciding as to the legality of the employment of the native troops in question, apart from the fact that their employment, in the absence of adequate training and preparation, miuht very conceivably constitute a danger rather than an asset.4. In conclusion, the General Staff desire emphatically to say that we must not be placed at a disadvantage compared with the French, and recommend that the question should be reconsidered immediately, in order that amendments may be made in the mandates before it is too late.
