OHUUCHIIL, COL OK I A3: 0FFIC3, 8.30 pam., 14th March, 1981.E3HS0HAL AIID 32CP3r.      To be deciphered by Marsh.Following for Prime Minister copies to be sent privately with my compliments to Chancellor of Exchequer and Lord Curzon,Prospects Mesopotamia promising but there are three points on which I require your help.First.    I think we shall reach unanimous conclusions among all authorities that Faisal offers hope of best and cheapest solution.        &apos;If so can we go ahead en this lino?   Formula would be &quot;In response to enquiries from adherents of 3mir Feisal the British Government have stated that they will place no obstacle In the way of his candidature as ruler of Iraq and that if he is chosen ha will have their support.&quot;    Do you think you   and lord Curzon have said enough to tho French to Justify my proceeding on this basis?   If so, all the batter because we do not want any premature disclosure and agitation to bo made by f?them).If however you feel that further reference to the French is necessary, surely now while grou are helping them in Germany would be the best moment for settling with them;   and in this case they should be asked to treat this
communication as confidential for the present.   On the j -ci receipt of your assent to this formula I shall tell Lawrence he can communicate formula to ?feisal.   On this Felsal will at once proceed to Mecca passing through Egypt on the way.   &quot;/e do not want any announcement even in guarded terms of formula if it can he possibly avoided until Feisal is at Mecca and Sir P. Grr: at Baghdad about the mi dale of April.   Method of choice will require careful study in order to avoid confuse a or meaninglssa ^xprejaaioxucrT Mesopo-mesopotamian opinion. Time is short as Sir P. Cox must return and all my plans depend on clear settlement with him before we separate. I have no doubt personally Feisal offers far away best ohance of saving our money.   Please therefore endeavour to telegraph to me as soon as you possibly can that I am free to make plans on basis of formula.Secondly,   I have not received any official account of your Turkish negotiations but Heuters summaries indicate that probable settlement has caused general satisfaction and relief to all concerned with Mesopotamia. Cen I now assume and so inform military that we need not prepare against Turkish inroad    or intrigue in Mosul this year?   Have you been able to stipulate fofc this with Turks?   If I take tab is as a basis it will greatly simplify my task of reducing garrisons quickly without giving up Mosul.   On the other hand if assumption is subsequently falsified all my dates of reduction will be upset. Please therefore if possible telegraph to me that I can count upon immunity from Turkish interference in near future.
Thirdly (? 4 groups missing)     Incredible waste (?no^) proceeding in Mesopotamia can only be cured by driving large numbers of troops and followers out of country and off our pay list.   On this I proposo, provider! my general plan is accepted, to tal:e immediate and drastic action thus securing large saving in 1921-22.      I am met by assertion that many thousands of mm and followers could now begin to leave country if shipping were available.  t Already it is declared that troops aro being delayed at Basrah through lack of shipping and certainly time t%blo of reduction of garrisin to pro-rebellion figures by March 31st on which we were counting is already fortnight in arrears.   &apos;&quot;?e have to carry everybody back sooner or later and keeping them waiting eating up our mutton is pure waste. Till you thorofo::i) kindly tell Shipping Controller or send his personal mossage that he is to meet my requirements and carry troops and followers away from Basrah as fast as I can bring them to port,   Exact figures will be furnished in a few days but considerable additional shipping will be required In the Persian Gulf as soon as possible;   and extra charge will be nothing compared to saving through earlier demobilization. I am provisionally telling military that they may assume that we wtfll carry away promptly whatever trocps they bring- to Basrah and that they have done their part when they have brought them to port.   Please confirm this,   I should also be obliged if you would impress on India Office that we cannot agree to being charged for these men for several months after they return to India.To sum up.   If in three o:* four days you can give me favourable answers on these three points I shall hope to send you definite and detailed programme of action.I propose leaving hero 31st Mai&apos;oh arriving London about April 7th.what aro your movomonts ?
Telegram from Prime Minister to Mr. Churchill(Xlarch 16th, 1921).Seoret cypher telegram.Following from Prime Minister to Mr, Churchill   in reply to personal and secret telegram received Colonial Office 14th March.Reply to three points in your telegram is as fo31ows:-First:   We have repeatedly hinted to the French that if there is a strong demand for Foisal from Mesopotamia and peace can he restored &quot;by establishing him as Ruler in Ira;, we should not feel justified in vetoing his candidature.   Unless initiative comes from Mesopotamia^ however, our position with the French will be embarrassing, and we think it will be very difficult to reconcile procedure you propose with tho attitude we have adopted with the French Foreign Office in this matter. We think it essentials, therefore, that real initiative in any demand for Faisal ahould come from Mesopotamia.    Sir Percy Cgx and Miss Gertrude Bell will no doubt advise you as t$ whether this initiative will be forth-coming.   You will doubtlosa recall, however, that Feisal when sounded in London as to his personal attitude made it perfectly clear that he would not become a candidate for Iraa until AbdullaTs claims had been disposed of.Second point:   We kave entered into no stipulation with the Turks which excludes the possibility of a Turkish inroad or intrigue in Mosul this year.   Turkish Delegation in London has recognised that we have offered very considerable concessions, but have protested against our proposals in regard Oo Smyrna and against absence of any concession in Eastern Thrace,   .;e have no oertainty that settlement will be accepted by Turks,   Turks are reported to be   concentrating troops on Groek front, and Greeks may feel compelled to attack them. We
are quite unable to control either side and no truce has been arrangec.   Should fighting occur it is difficult to jucuo what its reaction win he on Mesopotamian front.   v/e ere, however, warning Turks that if any hostile action is taken in Mesopotamia we shall consider ourselves at liberty to arm the Greeks.Third point:   I am in full sympathy with your desire to cure the waste and reduce troops in Mesopotamia.   I have asked Seorotary of State for  -ar and Shipping Controller to take up tho matter at once.III.Telegram from  rime Minister to Mr,,Churchill &apos;   &quot;        &quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;Ulai-oh 17th,1921).Pol lowing for. mr churchill ..from the Prime Minis tor.Begins:   I had an interview with Bekir Sami Bey last night, at v&apos;h:tch I raised the question of Mosul and told him that we had heard that the Turks   were menacing trouble in the BCosul area, and if this was true and they continued to do s&apos;o5 the British Government would be driven to assist the Greeks with suppliesa Beklr replied that Le could assure mo that it was not the intention of the Angora Government to make trouble in that quarter,   ^hoy had no interestsin doing so and wanted to leave tho Arabs to thornselvns, Mesopotamia was not worth tho cost of British friendship , liy own impression is that Bekir Sami Boy is vary anxious to re-establish good relations with tho British Stopire,   %o Allies have made very considerable con-oossions to Turkey for the sake of peace, and tho only
outstanding question r :1ator to Smyrna,     e h:;;v proposed s compromise, but fooling is so high on both sides that I am not sure that it will not be settled by a clash of arms between Turkey and Greece.   I think:, however, you r-ny rely on Bekir S mi Bey doing evorything possible to persuade the Angora Government to dc nothing to embroil itself either with Great Britain or Prance for the present.   I cannot estimating-ate the relative strength of the extremists at Angora, but Be&amp;ir Semi is an effective man and it will quite clearly be his policy to induce Angora to keep on go oil terms with us, oven though it is not possible to arrive at a friladly arrangement&apos; between Turkey and Greece for the moment.
