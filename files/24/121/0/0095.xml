I. NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN UNITED KINGDOM ONAPRIL 1, 1921.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent. The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unem-ployment figures, was 4-7 per cent.  It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.Throughout 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1920 are :- &quot; Per ceTltTo the end of- 2-9January    ... ...                     --                            -?february ... &quot;,&apos;        &apos;&quot;March     ... ... - -                   *&quot;        &apos;&quot;     q.qApril      ... ...                              &apos;,&quot;                j.^May       ... *&quot; &quot;June       ... ... ---                                      j.^July       ...............&apos; 1-6August    ... ...                               **&apos;                 2-()September ..-                                                g.gOctober    ... ...                   ---                           o *November ...                    ---                            g^j December ...The figures for 1921 are :-To the end of                                                 .          g.gJanuary   ... ... ---         ---                            g.gFebruary ...2.

3. General.Further increases in the numbers of persons registering at the Employment Exchanges are anticipated as a result of the extended stoppages of work connected with the Easter holidays. It is reported that the position in the iron and steel industry is slightly worse in Scotland, and large numbers of men are being paid oft&apos; each week. This industry is also in a very unsettled state in the north of England. Discharges continue from the shipyards on the Clyde, and between twenty and thirty vessels, on which little work is being done, are now lying in the yards. The position in the cotton industry has not improved, but it is believed that the depression has almost reached its lowest point, and it is expected that the very low output now obtaining will shortly result in a favourable reaction. No change is reported in the woollen or clothing industries, but there are signs of activity in the lace trade. This improvement, however, is regarded merely as the outcome of the temporary holiday demand. In the boot and shoe trade the prospects after Easter are considered to be somewhat brighter. A slight improvement is reported in the cycle and motor trade, and also in agriculture, but the number of agricultural labourers unemployed is still abnormal. Decreased activity is noticeable in the pottery industry. Considerable unemployment still prevails among&apos; fishermen and transport workers.The above reports relate to the period immediately prior to the miners&apos; strike, which now entirely overshadows the industrial situation, and will undoubtedly cause further serious increases of unemployment in industry generally.II. EMERGENCY WORK.On the 19th October, the Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons on the proposals of the Government to provide against unemployment. A further statement was made in the House by the Minister of Labour on the 21st December.1, The schemes of work then outlined (which have been more fully described in Report No. 22 for the week ended the 18th March, 1921, and earlier reports to the Cabinet) included the following : (a.) Arterial Roads.The anticipating of a four years&apos; programme for arterial roads in London and in the Provinces.(b.) Road Maintenance,Pressing forward with the Ministry of Transport programme of road classifica-tion and maintenance grants.(c.) Housing.The acceleration of the lay-out of roads and sewers on approved housing schemes work brought forward as additional to the main programme.(d.) Unemployment Grants Committee.The distribution by the Unemployment Grants Committee, under the Chairmanship of Viscount St. Davids, of a sum of  3,000,000 for the purpose of assisting Local Authorities on relief schemes other than house-building work and certain kinds of road work.(e.) Unemployment Insurance,The amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, in order to enable benefit to be paid to workpeople who had been unemployed since the Act came into operation and could not therefore qualify for benefit.2. More recently the following additional measures have been devised by the Government, viz. : (a.) The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1921.Under this Act, which became law on the 3rd March, the rate of benefit was raised from 15s. to 206-. for men and from 12.5. to 16s. for women, and it was provided[6033] &apos; L -2
Grand Total  ...        ...     84,293that benefit might be drawn for sixteen weeks in each of two periods running&apos; from the 3rd March, 1921, to the 2nd November, 1921. and from the 3rcLNoveuiber, 1021. to the 2nd July, 1922; alter the last date benefit to be drawn to the extent of twenty-six weeks in each insurance year.(b.) Alternative Work.Alternative work hasten arranged by the War Office at live national factories. This includes waggon-repairing, manufacture of medals, coin blanks, locomotives and new waggons and miscellaneous articles for the Post Office and for private firms.Alternative work has also been adopted at His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Industrial Establishments, but fresh entries for this work ceased on the 19th March. 1921.(c.) Short-time in Government Establishments.This policy was introduced on the 24th January, 1921, in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards and other Admiralty Establishments and in the Royal Ordnance Eaetories, Woolwich Arsenal and other National Factories administered bv the War Office.It was also introduced, where practicable, in the remaining War Departments, Industrial and Semi-Industrial Departments and Factories from the 7th February. No further entries in Admiralty Establishments have been made since the 19th March, 1921.(d.) Office of Works Emergency Programme.This includes a considerable amount of decorating and repair work in Govern-ment Departments with a view to the absorption of unemployed painters and similar workpeople.3. Other Public Work. In addition, various Local Authorities throughout the country are employing labour on schemes of relief work which have not been assisted by Government grants.Returns are received weekly from the Government Departments responsible and from the Local Authorities in regard to all the schemes of works indicated above, and the latest returns show that the number of men for whom emergency work has been found in this way is as follows: Summary of Labour engaged on Relief Schemes. (Including those for whom part-time employment is being provided.)(a.) Schemes assisted by Government Grants: Arterial Roads (a.) London           ...         ...         ...        ... 2,183(6.)

Public  Works put in hand by Local Authoritieswithout Government Grants ... ...        ...     13,255
As reports for the week ended the 1st April have been received from only 270 Local Authorities out of 350 who were asked to supply information, it is probable that the Relief Schemes which have been inaugurated by the Government and by Local Authorities are finding employment for a number of men in excess of 85,000.(The Ministry of Transport estimate that there are also some 20,000 men employed on road maintenance and repair work over and above those ordinarily so employed.)III.
