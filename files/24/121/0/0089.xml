HOME GROWN WHEAT.

Memorandum by Mr. Chamberlain.

(Previous Papers:-C.P.2783 and 2784).

Lord Crawford&apos;s memorandum (C.P.2783) is not, I think, a complete statement of the position for it hardly indicates that a subtantial further concession to the farmers beyond the original guarantee is proposed. The pledge given by the Prime Minister on March 11th, 1920 in the House of Commons was as follows:-

"So long as wheat is still controlled and thereby deprived of a free market the control price of home grown wheat of sound milling quality harvested in 1920, shall be the monthly average cif. of imported wheat of similar or comparable quality provided that the price which was paid to the home grower shall not exceed 95/- per quarter of 504 1bs."

The amplification of this promise given by Sir A. Griffith-Boseawen in the House of Commons on April 19th, 1920, stated that the price to be paid for British Wheat will be announced each month and will be the average of the c.i.f. cost of all milling wheat imported during the two preceding months and of the actual anticipated arrivals in the United Kingdom during the current month subject to a maximum of 95/- per a quarter.

The statement ends with the words "consequently the maximum price of 95/- will be payable for British wheat so long as the average price of imported wheat is in excess of that figure".

It is perfectly clear and it was made perfectly clear at the interview between the Prime Minister and the National Farmers&apos; Union on the 16th February last that the undertaking related to the price to be paid by the millers acting as agents of the Government. There was no undertaking that if the farmers chose to sell their wheat not directly to a miller but to an intermediary for a lower price they would be reimbursed
the differenoe directly by-the Government, the dealer being   528 allowed also to retain hie intermediate profit.   It was also made olear to the farmers that they were not entitled to sell their whs at at the guarantaod prioe at any tiiao convenient to themselves but only when it was required by millers in the ordinary way,At the Conference which took place under the Chairmanship of the Minister of agriculture on the 17th rebruary last the Minister definitely stated tfcut in dealing with the period between Novbmber, 1920, and the data on which the millers wore to be instructed to buy home grown wh at at 95/- per quarter all that the Government oould do would bo to instructj^l^gl^llg..JQ-...roo,gllP..fo. the person from whom they bought wheat the difference between the price aotua1 ly^paidjind 95/-,   In cases in which the wheat was not sold direct to the miller he pointed out that it would be up to the National Farmers^ Union to see th. t -ho proper sum was passed back to the actual producer.ah3 National Farmers1 Union representatives specifically accepted the responsibility for securing this result and though it is truo that the President of the Corn Merchants1 Associa-tion who was present gave his concurrence, the undertaking wras&apos; net made a condition of such concurrence,The farmers are not merely going back upon their undertaking as to the procedure by which recoveries oould be made, but they are also asking for a substantial1 extension of tho guarantee.   What has happened, I understand, Is that during tho late, autumn and winter many farmers anxious to realise their wheat sold to dealers: for (say) 6o/- or 85/- a ruartor and the deal-r subsequently sold it to millers for (say) 90/-.Farmers are asking not merely for the repayment&quot; to them of the 5/- which the miller is authorised to repay to tho dealer but e...so for tho other 1.0/- or 5/- as the c..-se may bewhich/
which the miller has already paid to the denlon.   If this were granted the Government would in fact be paying for that Wheat not the guaranteed price of 95/- but 10^/^ 0** even 105/- a quarter,-   Lord Crawford suggests that the additional cost of this extension night be  500,000, but I am informed that it might be anything up to  1,,500fi000.   I am quite , confident that no such concession was ever intended by the Government or expected by the farmers when the premise of a price of 95/- a quarter was given*It may be&apos;observed that the&apos;original promise has already been substantially extended by its application to the whole cereal year, notwithstandi.no; the&apos;:fact that the millers .have now been decontrol!! ed ot a roach earlier da&amp;Oo1 submit that there in no ;h:ativY) s Vlbn in the original&apos;promise for the farther&apos; ex&apos;c.e-)sU&apos;cn row proposed, and that the request for It is a plain breach of -the agreement accepted by the farmers on the 17th February last.I believe that if the Government stands firm upon the arrangements already made i ( which were recognised by the repre-sentatives of the Facers1 Union at the&apos;time as exceedingly liberal, the latter are quite strong eaough to arrive at an equitable .settlement, by direct negotiations with the Com Merchants1. Association^   But I see no object.ion to ihe Government making recoupment direct to the farmer&apos; in all&apos; oases, if that procedure is practicable -and is preferred, provided nlways that, the amount to he recouped is limited to&quot; the difference between tlie amount&apos;already paid by&apos;the millers on behalf of the Government and a quartereI should add that. !V;rl Crawford Is mistaken in supposing that there is any power to charge this expenditure to the Bread Subsidy Vote, et?en if it had been a proper charge to it. That Vote terminated on the 31st -larch and any unspent balance has of course been surrendered to the Exchequer *   I fear, however, that- in view of the fact that the Flour Mills weredecontrolled
decontrolled on &quot;the 1st Aprils it Yrj.ll he -necessary %q take a Vote (which the Ministry o,f Agriculture uill presumably hnve to,present) for the amount required to fulfil tho promise to. the farmers for tho. remainder -of the- cereal ye&amp;r* This, necessity malces it in my opinion all the more important to confine the concessions to the farmers within/the terms of the. promlseaactually made to them(Intd)   A.C.Treasury, S.7.April 4th.1921.
