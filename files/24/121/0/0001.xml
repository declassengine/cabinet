SECRET(P. 1398) FroMi Viceroy, Forehja Department, \Uh March 19.21. 2921(Received 9 pan.)Clear the lint1,327 S.   Afghanistan,   Following from Dobbs (one) 61 C, dated 7th March : &quot;Your telegram of (with March, .&apos;)J2S.   since demands (hat Secretary of State directs me to make will probably nipt aye negotiations, it onlyremains to htauouivre for a position to justify rupture to the public  My conclusions are First, further discussion must be official, since if Afghan-Bolshevik treaty is tO.be main ground of rupture, we must introduce it immediately into official conferences ; this has not yet been done.   Second, it would not appear straight forward or conciliatory lirst lo induce Afghans to promise to repudiate Bolshevik clause about consulates, and -then to spring upon them fresh demand(s) of which they had not been formerly apprised.   1 must, therefore, put in forefront of renewed discussions official request for disclosure of all the terms of Bolshevik treaty, and if treaty includes gifts of money and arms from Bolsheviks, must follow it up immediately with official request for elimination of such gifts from the treaty, and must add a stipulation to that effect to&apos; clause If) of our draft treaty.   Secrerary of State, of) course, understands that Afghanistan will never forego gifts of arms from (lie Bolsheviks unless we ourselves promise at least equivalent gifts.    This, I  understand, wo are not prepared to.do.   Third, Afghans will almost certainly refuse to reply before seeing whole of our draft treaty, as they will say that they must lirst know the (////(/ pro (/no.   If they adopt this attitude, I think  I   should at  once give them whole  of our draft treaty, with all concessions   contemplated   set,  forth   without&apos;  reserve,   including  cession  of Torkham,  Afghan representation  in London,  and  201   lakhs  subsidy   payable from date of Rawalpindi Treaty, clause 13,  containing modifications suggested by Government of India.   If we are aiming at total repudiation of Russian treaty, it will be useless to waste time haggling over concessions, and only dignified course is to set them forth at once and break off negotiations immediately if Afghans wilt not accept.   -Fourthly, if we rupture negotiations 1 should make official demand of (for) evacuation of Arnawai as sanctioned by the Government of India.   1 hope that I may receive very early orders, as there is faint hope that revelations made on 2nd March may induce Afghans yielding up (V yield) to our views regarding disclosure of treaty and elimination of Bolshevik money gifts.   They will1 certainly not do soil&apos; given time to recover from shock.   My position here would be iniol&apos; rable if, after extorting disclosure of Russian terms, 1 had to linger awaiting instructions,   i trust therefore that Secretary of State for India will not insist on pause which he apparently confern-plates after disclosure, but will trust- to me to make immediately such demands as are necessitated by his instructions and to leave if they are not conceded.   I. hope that I. may receive clear orders as to whether repudiation of arms as well as subsidy is to be insisted on.   One difficulty 1 foresee is that Afghans are not yet certain whether Moscow has fully accepted treaty, as their Tasbkend information indicates existence of protocol containing modifications.   They may protest inability lo disclose terms until after Rosenberg&apos;s arrival, which may not be for many weeks.1&apos;&quot;(Two.) Your telegram of the 7th March, 3.1.6 S., crossed my telegram No. 01 C. I shall make no communication to Afghans before 1 I lh March, and, failing further order, shall on that date ask for official meeting 12th March, and proceed. as indicated in my 01 C. Instructions of the Government of India on the question of subsidy do not seem quite definite. Under the head o read with Secretary of Sfato&apos;s orders, I am apparently, if Afghans disclose treaty, and if it contains promises of Russian gifts of arms and money, whether initial or recurring, to declare at once that such gifts make British friendship impossible. Last part of your telegram, however, seems to indicate that if the treaty contains subsidy [sic). Government of India still hopes induce Secretary of State to change his view(s). and that I am merely to report contents of treaty, and not irrevocably commit myself to such declaration until the receipt of further orders.&quot;&quot;(Three.) News contained in my telegrams of the 8th March, Very Secret, to Chief of the General Staff, seems to upset the whole course laid down. Only way to get on with negotiations now seems to be to assume that Bolshevik Treaty contains obnoxious provisions, and enter immediately in our draft treaty clause precluding acceptance of money and arms from other Bowers, and to present whole treaty thus altered to Afghans. But 1 cannot do this until I know whether Secretary of Stafas objection to both money and arms is final. I would again emphasise that demand regarding arms will be regarded by Afghans as intolerable.&quot;
Following sent to Dobbs, Utli March:-&quot; Your telegram of the 8th March, 02 G. Secretary ol Stato&apos;s s[)cciiic injunctions regarding subsidy, arc contained in his third sentence from the end. If Afghans admit presence of money grant in treaty, for you to pass it over in silence would have appearance of giving countenance to it. Hence you should refer at once to Viceroy&apos;s letter (luted 7th November and Amir&apos;s assurance. Probably you will then say that the matter must be referred to Government at once for orders, but Government of India has no wish to fetter your discretion. As arms were not mentioned in correspondence, your, altitude will have to he somewhat different, surprise at their inclusion being based on obvious Bolshevik desire to turn them against us. Secretary of Stated other references to the subsidy are confined to warnings of very strong views of His Majesty&apos;s Government about it. This you must bear in mind, but Government of India intend to urge with all possible force the point of view they have; consistently held themselves. This they will be in a better position to do on receipt of your report and recommendations, They sympathise with you fully on the awkwardness of your position, but are confident of your skill to turn it to all possible advantage. Your message of the 8th to Chief of the General Staff, and your 64 0, just received You should make your demand for disclosure of terms, reiterate that refusal will almost certainly preclude treaty with us, and report the result with your full recommendations. Your telegrams-Nos. 01, 02, 0-1 and (his reply are being repeated to Secretary of State for India, and the secret telegrams to the Director of Military Intelligence.&quot;
