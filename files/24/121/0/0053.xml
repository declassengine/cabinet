[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.SECRET.Paraphrase of a Telegram from Mr. Churchill to the Prime Minister.(Received Colonial Office 645 p,M., March 20, 1021.)In order that you may sec the full plan which we are elaborating, I indicate various readjustments of the subsidies to Arab chiefs which will he entailed.Ibn Saud has power to attack Lower Euphrates which was a few weeks ago raided by some of his followers. Disorderly elements will be encouraged by the reduction of our garrison and FeisaPs arrival will displease Ibn Saud. I propose therefore that his subsidy should be increased to 100,000/. a year, paid monthly in arrears, conditional upon his maintaining peace with Mesopotamia, Kuweit and Hejaz. Sir P. Cox believes that a subsidy of this amount will ensure his good-will over a difficult period and it may under settled conditions be reduced. Hussein and Ibn Saud must be treated on the same footing, and 1 propose that the former be paid a similar subsidy conditional upon improvement in the pilgrimage arrangements and on his promise to recognise peace treaties and to use his influential help in instituting order and good government in Arab areas.In Yemen conditions are difficult since we are not in touch with Imam. Agreement with him would permit outlying detachments of Aden garrison to be withdrawn and in consequence effect a considerable saving of military expenditure. I consider that if we can get in touch with him, we might offer him subsidy of 2,000/5. a month as part of our accommodation. Our greatest means of influencing him is our control over Idrisi pressure on his western frontier. To keep this weapon in my hands I propose to offer Idrisi subsidy of 1,000/. a month on the condition Dint he excludes foreigners from his area,Churchill.[5934]
