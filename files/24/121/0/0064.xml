QC a 3 I II g T.;jf .- 7 64.^ **, ggPQHT BY THE GT&amp;^AL OFFICER COI&amp;AHDING-IN-CHX5F ON THS SITUATION IN&quot;IRELAIID FOR(Circulated by the Secretory of State for War,)1. MILITARY SITUATION.The executions which were carried o$t in Dublin on Monday 14th inst: called forth a hysterical outburst in the hostile Press, every effort &quot;being made by gross misrepresent tation of the facts, to excite the passions of the public. Special precautions were taken by the G.O.C. lublin district to guard against any attempt of the rebels to retaliate upon officers and soldiers In the streets.   Thtt week, however, passed quietly until towards the end when seversi cases of the bombing of lorries took place in the City,   with one exception the bombing of the lorries caused no\casualties to the troops.   In the case of one vf these attacks, tho bomb fell behind the lorry, and, although the troops did not fire, five civilians in the street, including two women, were wounded.The principal incidents in Dublin during tho week haveboonThe action in which the Auxiliary Division E&apos;I.C, were involved in Brunswick Street, resulting in the death of one and wounding of four auxiliaries; while three rebels were killed and two captured.   The house which was raided was reported to be used cb a meeting place of rebels, and the fact that it was obviously being guarded by rebel picquets and that eight revolvers were found on the premises has led to the surmise that the house was used for the distribution of arms.-The attack on two despatch-riders, one of whom was killed.   The two were riding together and the man who was killed was carrying no despatches at the time.The attack on a lorry in Aungier Street, when two bombs fell in the lorry,&apos; resulting in the death of two soldiers and the wounding of one officer and six other ranks.&apos;Iln view of these recent attacks.on lorries1 in the -streets, Curfew in Dublin has been extended from 9 p. in.&apos;. to 8 p,m.   Earning had previously been given to the effect that this&apos; extension would become necessary if attacks con-&apos; tinuedi the Civil Government has issued a statement charging Messrs Collins, Burgess and hulcahy with Instigatingsuch
such attacks, pointing out that civilians in the streets are frequently wounded thereby and recommending the citizens of Dublin to bring pressure to bear upon these tbrae men.   The &quot;Freeman&apos;a1 Journal&quot; snd &quot;Independent&quot; omit all reference to these three gentlemen.In the country the situation has been comparatively quiet until the week en , but on the 19th inst; two serious collisions occurred near Bandon between Crown forces and the rebels, in which large numbers of the latter were involved.     Of these engagements, the attack on a mixed column of troops and police is the nearest approach to actual warfare, as contrasted with ambushes, that has. yet. occurrede   Seeing, however, that it wes the transport march in f? some &apos;U stance in rear of the column, that was the objective of the attack, it is probable that the affair developed into a bigger operation than the rebels had intended.   The large number&apos;of casualties suffered by the Grswn Forces is duo chiefly to the fact that the column was unable to come into action until the attack on the   . transport had. been go in,&apos; on for some time.    .At Inngarvan a mixed party of troops and police was attacked by rebels in large numbers,, resulting in the death of one constable R, I,C,   The rebel casualties are believed to have been seven killed.&apos; : &apos;&quot;The large number of rebels involved in the above two attacks, the details of which are given in a separate paragraph of this report, seems to indicate that Rebel Hying Columns and active Service Unite are concentrating into larger bodies, and reports from the Cork Area lead to. the belief that, in Tipoerary, the &amp;$tive Service ,Units of the northern and Midland Brigades have amalgamated, and that, in &apos; etorfcrd, the columns of the Eastern and Western Brigades have done the same.     This amalgamation into larger bodies was expected as the natural result of the ill&quot;success of smaller rebei columns^There is a distinction between Plying Columns, and Active yervice Units or .ie6tions3   flying Columns are composed of rebels of any rank who, being 1 wanted&apos; are unable to live at home, and who ere therefore lon the run1a These men band themselves together and operate in their own Brigade Areas,   Active Service Unit1&apos; and Sections, are composed principally of officers alv,the I.R.A.- - Battalions and a few selecwd specialists.   The personnel of these v Units are not necessarily &apos; on the run&apos; but may be men who, have not yet been identified with I,R.A*   Both Hying Columns and Active Service Units make use of the local Volunteers in the district where they oarry out attacks, and employ the Manna and Cumana Ua Mbsn as Scouts, heispatch-riders and&apos; for intelligence-work.In County Kerry :there is a strong rumour that rebel con-concentrations are taking place..   This probably means that some units of the I*R*A. are planning activities In Kerry,   It is not at present possible to forecast the extent of such activities,mm      2    &quot;*
ectivities, but the 1*0*0* 6th Division incline? to the belief that a rising is contour: It ted in Kerry.    If this is the case two possibilities must be considered.    Either the rising will be a looel offFir due to the Kerry rebels feeling their strength and havin   been encouraged b,v the recent murder of the  o\. Commandant of the Kerry sirijade, or it may bo an attempt to draw off trc. troops from other areas and thereby give en open - 7.    0: jisings elsewhere..   There are at present no indict tiers that risings   are likely to occur else&apos; eere, but it must be borne in mini that any success achieved by the rebels b.v a rising in Kerry would inevitably lead to similar risinss in other ni.rts of Ireland. The continued cutting oi roads in all areas may have a connection with the seme plan.   But whatever may. oe.the ultimate intentions oi the rebels, it is clear that a rising in i,err,, is a very serious matter end -plans for meeting such a situation ar.e engaging my attention,   l&apos;.n this connection I. have already telegraphed for permission to ariL aeroplanes wi.tji machine guns and small bombs.   The 0.0.0. 6th Division is most strongiy of the opinion, in &quot;.-hioh I concur, that such notion would have a very greet effect in dealing with e-rising in Kerry and I need not enlarge uooe the necessit1; of subduing such a rising before it has gained ground.It has boon found n cessary in several districts to prohibit fairs and maryets owing to the cutting of roads. The local inhabitants have, up to nov been the principal sufferers froi; road destruction, and farmers are beginning to object to this procedure.I have again thought it necessary? to call attention to the revolutionary tone of the &quot;freemanf/S Journal&quot; and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.   These papers are openly used for rebel propaganda which amounts, in my opinion, to. incite-raent to murder of Crown forces.I consider that the tina \v.n come ween an end should be put to the licence hitherto a: lone:! to :he disloyal press, end I have requester the Civil Government to concur in the suppression of the &quot;&quot;&quot;leemanVa Journal&quot;, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and their affiliated evening issues.:.&apos;ov. that the rebel activities have assumed some likeness to military, operations,the question of propaganda becomes increasingly important, for it&apos; is obvious from the tone of the English Press that there erdsts in England a more &quot;or less dispassionate contemplation of the success or failure of two belligerents in legitimate warfare.   In the absence of any il lamina tine statement throughout&apos; England *
England of the real facts of trie ease, such an attitude it: sure to gala man;, adherents from the flUss of people which views with equanimity, if not, \ ith open sy -apathy, any reaistance oi authority,   Ahe English papers take their views largely from their Irish special correspon-dents, v,ho again   are influenced by the rebel press- in this country.In this connection memoranda have been prepared by the Judjjr- Advocate General which fully ex.] lain the position of the rebels in regard to tie Geneva Convention and accented rules oi Par.   Phese memoranda have been in the hands of the Government for some time and it is in my opinion regiettable that the;, nave ah- yet not been made use ox.OlhKATlCho   outre-aGno.ft/El.
