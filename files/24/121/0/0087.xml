Baldwin points out that the work of the Committee has no\. reached a point at which they find it necessary to ask the Cabinet for:-
(a) Approval to the draft of a letter which It Is proposed to send to the ivlarooni Company.The draft of the letter in question is reproduced as an enclosure to I.lr. Baldwin&apos;s letter whioh is given in the Appendix to this note.(b) A decision as to Whether it is to be tho policy of His :.;ajesty&apos;fl Government to continue to conduct foreign wireless service a in competition with the Marconi Company,(c) a decision as to the degree of authority tobe given to i*ir. Baldwin&apos;b Committee in conducting negotiations on behalf of Government Departments, and as to the Cabinet Minister to whom sir. Baldwin can refer, if necessary, during his negotiations with the ;.iarconi Company.Regarding the question whether nis ..ajost;v&apos; &apos;s Government should continue to conduct wireless services in competition with the Ijjarconi Company, the views held in the General Post Office are(1) &apos;i.&apos;hat the decision of the Cabinot that the Marconi Company should be granted Licences for ioieign services was subject to the, explicit condition that the;, should not receive a monopoly.   If the Company is not. to have a monopoly as against other Companies, still lees should-it bo granted a monopoly as against the uOvcminento(2) That if suoh a monopoly were given, the  ost Office stations which have been constructed or are under construction, would be useless.    Communication is at present being oarried on through these stations with Germany, Hungary, Xtal;., ..ervia, Denmark, Sweden and &apos;  Norway*(3) That several Continental administrations retain Wireless Telegraphy in the hands of the Government and would prefer to deal with Governments rather than with a private Company,( i ) * . a * i i , * *-    i3    v-
(4) That if the lost Office engineers arc to conduct efficiently the Imperial tireless scheme in accordance with the dec.; a ion ol. the Cabinet, it is important that thoy should not be shut out from experience in other wireless enter; rise,   xhe wireless system at present employed in the Government stations, vuiieh it; protected b; patents, is certainly not inferior and. probably superior to anything which the Marconi Company have so far produced,(5) That the lost Office as joint ov,ners with the Continental iidrninistiratione of the Anglo Continental cables should have first-hand experience of wireless telegraphy as an alternative to the cable-s, in order that effective arrangements ma;: be made for co-ordinating the uso of cables and v;.iroless according to the needs of the traffic.^ho General lost Office do not suggest that they should at present provide nev stations other than those now under construction, but they urge that an^ concession &quot;which is made to the liarconi Company should not involve a restriction in the use of the existing stations, which have been built at the public ex ense and will require all the revenue obtainable in order to make them remunerative.) M.I.A. HAIJKEY.oecrotary, Cabinet.- 4 -g, Whitehall Gardens, ti.V/.fl. fetid April, 1921.
A P PS II D I X.it, Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., to Lieut-Colonel Sir M.P.A.   .Kanl coy, g, g. B.The Treasury,11th, March, 1921.Dear Hankey,1,   You will remember that on the 2nd January the Committee of Imperial Defence decided on the establishment of a small Committee (of which 1 was made Chairman) which should take over from Lord Milner the negotiations which he had opened with Mr. Godfrey Isaacs, the Managing Director of the Marconi Company, and should consider suitable conditions on which that Company might be grantod licences to erect tho necessary stations in the United kingdom for conducting wireless traffic with foreign countries.     The work of the Committee has now reached a point at which we find it necessary to seek further Cabinet authority, and I suggest that it might be desirable for tho following points to be laid before the Finance Committee.2.   After considerable discussion we have come to the conclusion that the licences ought not to be granted while the Marconi Company and the Government are involved, as they are at present, in a large number of long-standing disputes, and that we should in fact make a settlement of all the Company^ claims against Departments a previous condition to the granting of the licences.     My Committee consider that the only practical way of reaching a speedy settlement is to refer all the points at issue, including questions of compensation and validity of patents, to a single arbitrator, whose decision both sides would agree to accept as final. The only points which we recommend should be left outside the scope of the proposed arbitration are the future use ofpatents...
patents In the stations to ce used for the Imperial Wireless Chain, raid certain proceedings,which the Llarooni Company have already sto ted by petition pi Right against the post Office.3*   I have had two interviews with Mr* Isaacs and I understand informally that his Company will probably.accept a reference to arbitration on the above linos.   I am now proposing to send him a letter (of whioh I oncloso a copy) which is intended to put this suggestion boforo the Corn any in a more formal way.   The torms of tho ldtter were drafted in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor.4.   Assuming that tho Marooni Company accept this proposal, and that their claims are definitely sottlod by the arbitrator, my Committee has still to undertake the negotiations with the Company of the actual terms of the licences.     Here again I feel that the Cabinet should bo consulted, 3ince Itfeel certain that we shall maio ho progress with tho negotiations until the Marconi Company are mado definitely aware of the Governmenfs intention regarding the Post Office wireless services to foreign countries.5.   The following then are tho points on which wo think a Cabinet decision is required(i) whether/government ar.?roval can be  .iven to my draft letter to Mr, Isaacs *(ii) whether it is the Government1 s policy that tho Post Off:lop* should still coatitne to coodyc t foreign s?:lr3less services in oompotitioa with the Marooni Company*(Iii)   a decision as to the degree of authority given to my Committee in conducting negotiations on behalf, of Departments.   It is not inconceivable that a Department with many disputes of long standing with the Marconi Company, should object to the terms of reference to the arbitrator (which are neaessarily a matter for my Committee), or should find it difficult to accept his ruling, on the ,points in which they are interested.   I suggests &quot;that it would bo helpful if the Government were xto ^narae a Cabinet Minister to whom I could refer any povint of this nature that may arise, end whose
bldecision the Department concerned would have to accept as &quot;binding.     The Minister would be acting, as regards these negotiations as a successor to Lord Milner.Yours sincerely,(SB)   STANLEY BAUDOT.Draft letter to Mr. Godfrey 0. Isaacs, Marconi&apos;s wireless telegraph Company Limited. .Dear Mr. Isaacs,I have been giving further thought to the points we discussed.at our last meeting, ;and I am.now sending you for consideration by your Company, the proposal for a reference to arbitration which I then promised. .As I informed you, my Committee, which was appointed by the Cabinet to consider suitable conditions on which your Company nay be granted licences to erect the necessary stations in the United Kingdom for conducting wireless traffic with foreign countries, has reached the definite conclusion that the granting of these licences should be conditional on a previous settlement of all the.company outstanding claims against British Government Departments. -I explained at,our interview that there are reasons for which it seems to me hardly practicable to dispose of these-claims by agreeing upon a money payment in full, settlement, and I think you fully agreed that a reference to a single arbitrator acceptable to both parties was the best course to adopt, and that his decision should be final.
If your Company are willing to enter into such an arrangement I shall be glad if you will be so good as to forward to me particulars of all claims (except as expressly mentioned below) which the Company ha.- against the Crown, including any Government Department, in order that a draft agreement providing for the terms of their submission may be prepared for consideration.    As the object in view is to dispose of all outstanding matters, the Company would of course undertake not to raise any further claim in respect of any matter existing prior to (say) the 31st January, 1921.I think it was agreed at our discussion that two points must be excepted from the general mass of outstanding claims to be settled by arbitration:-(i)   the future use of patents in the stations to beused for the Imperial Wireless Chain, (il) the proceedings which your Company hsve already started by Petition of Right against the PostOffice, acting on behalf of the Admiralty, inrespect of War Services. I hope this proposal will receive your Company&apos;s careful attention, and I look forward to hearing that they are ready to entertain it.     Any further suggestions which you may wish to make will of course be considered, and I shall be only too ready to attempt to clear up any points in which you may still be in doubt.Yours very truly,
