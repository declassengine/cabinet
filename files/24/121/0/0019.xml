(P. 1404)       From Secretary of Slate to Viceroy, Foreign Department,lllh March mi.Clear tho line.1501. Your telegrams Nos. 327 and 399 S., dated 9th and 10th March. Dobbs will since have received instructions conveyed in your telegram dated the 9th March, and will no doubt have modified programme set forth in his telegrams Nos. 61, 62 and 04. Fact that Bolshevik treaty awaits approval and ratification by Amir, and cannot apparently reach Kabul for some time, seems to allow scope for British negotiations, and I am sure Dobbs will make best use of present friendliness of Afghans and of current reports as to situation in Russia. He might for the moment, if he thinks it best, merely say that His Majesty&apos;s Government will expect to be informed of the terms of the treaty with the Bolsheviks, and that they object to subsidy and arms; but he need not at present present the Afghans with anything like an ultimatum. Difficulties of his task are fully appreciated here, but at the same time our confidence in him leads us to hope that he will still find means of overcoming them.It
