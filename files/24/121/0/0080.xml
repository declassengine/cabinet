C A B I N s T.REPORT   BY   POOD   CONTROLLER.Reference Cabinet 25(20) Conclusion 6(e).My last report on the sale of Australasian Meat by my Department was fluted let March, 1921 / V*I hoped to have been able to report that the last of the-Australasian stocks were afloat, since provision had beon made for the whole of the stocks to be lifted by 28th February. Unfortunatoly howover serious labour troubles In New Zealand have prevented the programme being completed but thero will remain to be shipped at 31st March only about 1032 tens*In presenting this my final report I wi3h to summarise for the information of the Cabinet the transactions of my Department in Australasian and Patagonian Meat since the task of disposal of Government stocks was entrusted to me by the Cabinet,A. Position at 31st March. 1920.Stocks on hand, afloat, and quantities to be expeoted during the currency of the purchasing contracts, (In round figures).(1) Government stocks of Beef, 1,500,000 Quarters Beef equal to 65 weeks pre-war rate of consurap-tion of Australasian Beef. (2) Government stocks of Mutton 18 million Carcases equal to 93 weeks pre-war rate of consumption of Australasian Mutton. In the Spring of 1920 acute congestion in all the U.K. cold stores, especially in the Pert of London, was causing great delay to shipping and entailed charges for demurrage which were reported to the Cabinet (ReferenceCP. 1226) to amount to  3,000 per day.B. Position at 31at March, 1921.(1) Government stocks of Beef - nil. (2) Government stocks of Mutton about 30,000 tons, say Ij- million Carcases, equivalent at the**l*v
-    4?current rate of consumption to about 10 weeks suppi All congestion in the cold stcr6s and docks has been removed. FBIAKCIAL RESULTS .It will be some time before the books can be finally closed, but I am satisfied that, making provision for all contingencies, the final accounts of the Government^ operations in Australasian and Patagonian meat will show a balance of profit in hand, DISPOSAL;The 493,000 tons of meat dealt with from 1st April, 1920 to 31st March., 1921 have been disposed of as follows s-Sold in U.K. through Agents..........312,000 tonsSold to traders...................... 90,000   &quot;Sold to Foreign Countries............ 61,000   11463,000   &quot;Approximate Balance in hand (muttonat 31.3.21.......................30,000   tt &amp; lamb)493,000itThe quantity which was sold to foreign countries, with the exception of 3,000 tons supplied to the Austrian Relief Commission, has been disposed of for cash through trade channels.PRICES.The Cabinet authorised me to reduce the price of Imported mutton and lamb by 3d per lb.   I did not find it necessary to take full advantage of this authority, and the results would appear to justify the decision.   The price of lamb has not been reduced throughout the whole period. Tho price of the better quality of mutton has also remained unchanged, and with only one class of mutton was it necessary to take advantage of the authority to reduce the price to the extent cf 3d per lb and this ^ra^G represented a relatively small proportion of the whole.   It was considered desirable, Instead of making any flat reduction in the prices for mutton to grade prices more in accordance with their relative marketo
mmvalue, and this polioy proved acceptable to the trade.The Meat (Maximum Prices) Order was revoked as from 29th March and price control is now removed from meat of all descriptions. ADVERTISING.The Cabinet instructed that the Ministry should take steps to acquaint the public with the merits of the meat they had. for disposal, and for this purpose the expenditure of a sum of  20,000 was suggested.   Tho only expend!turo actually incurred was for the preparation of a cinema film advocating the consumption of meat raised within the Empire. This film was displayed at some 1,500 cinemas and elicited a considerable amount of interest.   The total cost involved was about  5,000.   In addition, steps wore taken to secure the insertion in numerous newspapers of hints on the various methods of making attractive dishes out of imported mutton. Hew far the Increased consumption can be attributed to those efforts cannot bo defined, but the publicity could hardly fail to be-to the ultimate benefit of the trade in meat from the Dominions. DEMURRAGE.The situation in May 1920, was rendered more acute &quot;by the demurrage being incurred on the meat-carrying vessels. It should be added therefore that the demurrage incurred on vessels arriving during the last ten months has amounted to only  4,500 a month compared with  587,000 on arrivals during tho previous 20 months. STOCKS.The Stock position as at 18th March is shown on attached schedule.
