This Doperty ofHis Lnment.cabinet memorandum by the Chairman of the RoyalCommission on HiWheat Supplies.I regret to say that the scheme for paying the 95/-. guaranteed to farmers for homegrown wheat has collapsed.February 17th, between the Ministry cf Agriculture, the Treasury, the Pood Ministry, the Royal Commission cn Wheat Supplies, Farmers and Merchants.   A scheme was agreed by all concerned, including Mr. Haslfcr the President of the National Association of Corn and Agricultural Merchants.    Mr. Hasl^s concurrence was specially impor-tant, as probably sixty per cent of homegrown wheat reaches millers through merchants. (2)        On March 21st the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies were officially informed that after prolonged discussion the merchants as a whole refused to endorse the scheme accepted by their President on February 17tho   Friendly co-operation of the Merchants is imperative, but the Government has no control over them, no power to give $hem instructions^ still less to make them surrender their profits, and perhaps no right to reimburse their losses. These merchants decline to act as the channel through which public money is to pass from the Treasury to tho farmer. We cannot force them to do so, and it is equally clear that the farmerls influence will not suffice, even if they were willing to enter upon a bitter campaign with hostile merchants for declining to act as agents for the Government.(3)       The Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies therefore pro-pose to recognise merchants certificates as we recognise(1)On Cabinet instructions a conference was hold on
those of Millers. This will prevent the re-opening of closed oontraots and will ensure the merchants help. Local panels of farmers and merchants will be established to certify the docu-ments and safeguard the Treasury against fraudulent or improper olaims. I may say this was the original, idea, but the assurancos given by the President of the Merchants Society led to our attempt to short circuit the procedure. Our hopes have been falsified. Had wo realised at the outset that the scheme as now amplified presented the only workable system implementing the Pledge, the proposal would have been acceptod long a?p without demur.(4)      The Lord Privy Seal is much concerned    that the new proposal may cost the Exchequer an extra  500,000. I admit the original oost may be exceeded, though I can frame no precise estimate,but I cannot bolieve the extra cost can be so high as suggested, I imagine the money could be legitimately charged to the Bread Subsidy Vote which is estimated to show a surplus of nearly  5,000,000, on Maroh 31st as the outlay is in respect of wheat bought during the dosing financial year.(5)      I see no alternative method of fulfilling the Prims minister&apos;s pledge. To confine the guarantee to those farmers who can pro-duce millers certificates will exclude more than half the wheat involved. Six weeks have elapsed since the Farmers1 deputation to the Prime Minister, and only  3,700 has been paid out to meet olaims. Farmers are already suspicious. Fresh delay and still more a fresh disappointment will herald an attack which will en-danger every agricultural seat in Britain.(6)      It is not a convenient moment for the Cabinet to divert its attention from problems of supreme gravity. Nevertheless I re-spectfully urge that it is more than ever essential to maintain the confidence of the Agricultural world. I accordingly invite*an early decision.C vi B.1st April 1921.
