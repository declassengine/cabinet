(Circulotod by th; Chi ;f S;cr.)tary for Irjland).I submit Jor the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 26th instant.GENERAL STATS OF THE POULTRY Statistics of Outrages.The heavy casualties sustained by the Crown forces are again the most prominent feature of tho week1s statistics of outrages.     The total for the week (46) is one in excess of that for last week which was the highest figure recorded for any one week since the Rebellion of 1916.    Nineteen of these casualties (five -tilled and fourteen wounded) wero sustained by the Police, and twenty-seven (thirteen killod and fourteen wounded) by the Military.     Police casualties included the deliberate assassination in odd blood of a constable of the Royal Irish Constabulary who was murdered whilo absent on sick leave at his home in Mullinahone, Co, Tipporary on the 20th instant.IHneteen of the Military casualties were sustained in an ambuBh of a train at Headford Junction, Co. Kerry on the 21st instant.      The train which contained a military party consisting of one officer and twenty-nino other ranks wasSECRET.C uPo1-27o2-1-
-    484heavily fired into from both tiirl :s of a cutting as it approached the entrance to the station, and the majority of tho casualties wore inflicted while the troops wore in the cot of detraining.    Although greatly outnumbered by the attackers who had the further advantage of a well dhosen position, tho sur-.survivors of the military party maintained a defensive on^a^ement ior nearly an hour when they wore reinforced by the arrival of another train which al3 0 contained a party of troops and the rebels thereupon withdrew from the attack.     Tho military losses were one officer and eight other ranks Killed end ton other ranks wounded.     In addition one civilian passenger was killed and two wounded.   It is believed that severe casualties wore inflicted upon the rebels, four at least of whom arc known to have been killed, but the exact number of rebel casualties could not bo ascertained.Another engagement resulting in heavy losses to the Grown Forces took place on the 23rd instant, when  a military party, consisting of two officers and four othor ranJOB, who were travelling with three prisoners, (all constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary) in a motor tender to Longford were attacked by about forty rebels at Stramogue, near Strokostovm Co. Rose omra on, and completely overpowered.     Ono officer and one otier rank were killed, and tho other officer mortally wounded and three remaining members of the military party and one of the prisoners were wounded.     The.fate of the other two constables who wore taken  away unwoun&amp;ed by the rebels, is unknown.An encounter with a more satisfactory result took placo on the same evening at listole, near Dingle, Co. Korry,
where a police patrol consisting of a District Inspoo tor, a sergeant and nine cony tables were ambushed by about two hundred rebels, armed with bombs and firearms of various kindsg and after a fight lasting for nearly three hours succeeded in complete grouting thoir assailants,     The rebel losses in this affair are estimated at 8 killed and BO wounded and a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition fell into the hands of tho police whoso only casualties wore 4 wounded, none seriously.Tho total number of attacks on tho Grown forces during the wee&amp; wero 25*   Of these 22 were ambushes 3 attacks on oooupiod police barracks, and 1 the case of assassination above mentioned.

The heavy falling off in the figures for February is no doubt due to the fact that the bulk of the arms and ammunition in the possession of loyalists
had been given up in the preceding   two months.BRIi&apos;GlaG IhTO OPLRATIOL OF GOVs :Iil;-,1:T OP Iid^Ajjg ACT.Arrangements for the brin(&apos;ln3 into operation of the Government of Ireland Act are being proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.
