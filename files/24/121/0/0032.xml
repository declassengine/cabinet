(Received 15th, 8 a.m.)Priority A.361 S. Following telegram has been received from Dobbs, 08 CJ, dated 12tli March: &quot; Yesterday I. proposed official meeting for to-day, but Tarsi asked me to explain my position iirst at a private meeting which will take place this afternoon. 1. have made the following addition at the end of clause 10 in case course of discussion makes it necessary for me to propound whole of our draft. 20  lakhs of rupees with effect from the date of ratification of the treaty. Further, as au immediate and additional token of goodwill which it bears towards&apos;Afghanistan, British Government agrees to grant Government of Afghanistan on the ratification of the treaty sum of 31 lakhs.&quot; 2. This sum represents arrears of subsidy from the date of signature of Rawalpindi treaty to 12th February 1921. My reasons are, first, payment takes shape of spontaneous grant instead of arrears, and this appears more generous and less like admission of Afghan right to arrears ; secondly, actual subsidy, as apart from gift of 31 lakhs, will be drawn from date of ratification, and there will be inducement to Afghans ratify quickly.&quot;
