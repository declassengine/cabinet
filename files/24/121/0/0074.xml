This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.-;      :   117/SECRET.CP. 2773. 2-THE CABINET.GRANT OP BRITISH DECORATIONS TO ALLIED TOWNS.778 aMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I ask for a Cabinet decision on the policy of grouting British Decorations to Allied 0137 towns.Up to the present, the only places that have been so decorated are Verdun and Ypres, which were presented with the Military Cross, and Dunkirk, which received the Distinguished Service Cross. Proposals to decorate other places, such as Calais and Marasesti, the &quot;Verdun&quot; of Roumania, have been negatived, the policy, of conferring decorations on places being regarded as undesirable from the military point of view, except, perhaps, in very special cases in theatres where British troops operated.The French have, however, taken a different view, and have decorated Calais, Liege, Ypres, Marasesti and Belgrade, and it is thought that this policy may serve to secure tor her popularity and commercial advantages in the countries concerned, where the feeling towards this country is not always wholly sympathetic. Although the Army Council are still averse from any course which might have the effect of cheapening the value of British Decorations, they will not press their objections if political con-siderations are held to warrant action, and it is suggested that, if the principle of giving British Decorations to towns is approved, they should now be bestowed on the selected places in anticipation of possible similar action by the French elsewhere, Belgrade, Marasesti, one town in Italy (possibly Asiago or Vittorio Veneto), and, perhaps, Salonika (though it may be thougl.it advisable to exclude Greece), are put forward for consideration.L.
