No signs of improvement in trade can bo discerned and naturally distress is becoming acute.   In Sheffield the Communists appeuf likely to cause disorder.Improvement can scarcely be looked for as long as coal remains at its present price and there is no reduction in the wages paid to miners and railwayman.   The prospect of a reduction in wages is the great question in the Labour world.   Opposition is strong but the steadier men have begun to realise that a national general strike, whioh the extremists advocate,;would mean an attempted revolution; and for this they are not prepared.The miners differ regarding the coal owners&apos; offer.   There will not be a national strike, but owing to the activity of the Unofficial Reform Committees there may be sectional disturbances.The Red International of Trade Unions is in financial difficulties, due, possibly, to a change in the Soviet policy. Efforts have been made to organise a Red International of Seamen and a Conference is to be held in  petrograd in August if the Soviet lasts so long.SECRETReport No. 98
UMEMPLOYMEMTApril 3rd is to be observod as &quot;Unemployment Sunday&quot; throughout Great Britain; chosen speakers will explain the proposals of the Labour Party for the alleviation of the crisis and a resolution drafted by the National Executive will be submitted.The London Workers Council of Unemployed Organisctions issued on tech 19th the first number of &quot;Out of Work&quot; of which Lire. Thring appears to be the editor; the paper is printed by the Agenda Press, consists of four pages, and costs one penny. The first issue is communistic in tone and makes a strong appeal to class hatred, but does not appear to be actionable.In Lancashire and Cheshire, unemployment figures are still increasing, the latest: recorded total, including workers on short time, being 565,578.   There is no indication of any improvement and distress grows daily more acute.   Most of the cotton trade unions have exhausted their funds and it is thought that as the result of the Allied advance into Germany, firms which export to that country may have to close down.My correspondent reports that the unemployed are becoming very restive in Sheffield, where the communists are firmly entrenched.   They have secured the Corn Exchange, which holds about 8,oon people, as headquarters.Daily meetings are held and on Maroh 16th at the instigation of the communists the unemployed refuged to sign on for relief work at l/l per hour; a meeting was held outside the relief office and the door marked &quot;Closed&quot; by the unemployed,   On March 18th the Labour Lord Mayor addressed a meeting, but appears to have made no effeot on the men and his speech was speedily ridiculed by the Communists.   Over the platform was a bl?&amp; and white banner, i   IE ft. by 6 ft. with crosfl bones and skull and bearing theIinscription &quot;Death is better than semi-starvation&quot;.   After the meeting a procession marched to the Guardians when a deputation was/
was received.   My correspondent is of opinion that although there has hitherto been no breach of the peace, disorder mual be the inevitable outcome of this communist agitation.        IIn Coventry unemployment is still increasing, but great hopes are based by the unemoloyed upon the British-Russian trading agreement; the same feeling prevails in Leicester where an improvement after Easter is anticipated.   It is worg of record that from the end of June 1920 to the end of Februfj 1921, the National Union of Beot and Shoe Operatives paid on::  73,887, 2. 8, in unemployment benefit, as against  86,468.11 for the whole period from 1907 to June 1920.The number of registered and unregistered unemployed in Glasgow is now estimated at 50,000.   Much bitterness is expressed regarding the numerous summonses for rent: it is reported that the magistrates have been instructed to allow three weeks&apos; respite instead of granting summary ejection or^ but it is. difficult to see how the unemployed are to obtain! necessary money during this period.   John MacLean&apos;s gangs am exploiting the position and opposing evictions.VISIT OP THE PRINC5 OF WALES TO THE EAST END [On March 22nd the Prince of Wales inspected the Jewish jiLads&apos; Brigade and attended a Concert organised by the PolicJin aid of the unemployed of Steoney and Poplar.   His royal highness had a great reception and it is clear that the Tisiiwas well timed and will have more than a transient effect.The Concert realised more than  2,500 and, with the proceeds!a subsequent entertainment to be given on April 7th, more th 3,000*   The money will be dispensed by a Committee workingtouch with the Mayors1 Fund.   The Labour Mayors of Stepney ePoplar attended the Concert and.were presented to the PrinceWales.   The success of tho Consort may be gauged by the fact the &quot;Daily Rorcld&quot; has omitted tV mention it.., THE/
TEE COAL MINERSThe moderates gained a victory at last week18 conference and passed by 106 to 47 votes the following very important resolution:&quot;That the opinion be taken of the respective districts, by conference, to decide as to whether or not they are prepared temporarily to abandon the policy of a National Wages Board and a national pool and empower the National Executive Committee to proceed with tho negotiations with a view to establishing a temporary agreement cn a district basis during the present period of abnormal state of trade and prices; also tho Executive to proceed to secure principles for the futuro guidance of districts for application in a more normal period of trade.&quot;The national delegate conference will consider the districtreports on March 24th and while it is unlikely th&amp;t a national strike will be declared, sectional action cannot at this Juncturebe ruled out.As far as can at present be ascertained feeling in the individual coalfields is guided largely by the amount cf the expected decrease in wages.   In Durham, fcr instance, whore the difference is believed to bo about 3s., the Executive is opposed to a strike; in South Wales and Scotland, where tho sums involved are about 27s. 6d. and  1, feeling is much stronger.On March 19th a special meeting of the Durham Miners&apos; Association discussed the situation;   the meeting was privato but a circular from the Executive of the National Federation was read in which it was explained that the loss of the export markets had resulted in a tremendous slump in the trade, also in the closing down of some mines and the dismissal of 60,000 or 70,000 men in the industry.   The industry was, therefore, face to face with a reduction in wages which c^uld only have been avoided &quot;by the Government agreeing to subsidise the trade until markets revived.   It was now necessary to consent to a temporary agreement or to allow the notices to expire and coase work. As there was no money in the industry and very little in thevarious/
various miners&apos; associations and in view of the vast army of unemployed and unonnlcyables, the miners must recognise that jj tido was against them, and that it was very doubtful whether t could successfully carry through a strike. A prolonged discuj took place and it was eventually decided to hold private lod$ meetings throughout the oounty   to discuss the question.Some of the delegates to this Council meeting advocated o action on the part of the whole Trade Union movement against \ reduction of wages, but the foregoing decision was carried byi majority of about 50 to 1.Tho lodges around the Worth East District of Durham have decided to endorse the policy cf a temporary district agreemer,Trie florthuiiVoerland Miners&apos; executive met on March 22nd an decided to recommend acceptance of district rates, tut is talii the opinion of branches. A majority of the men in those two c fields hope that a setialoraent will be reachod without a strikeProm Lancashire and Cheshire my correspondents report tha&apos; although there is not much talk of a strike, a largo percentag1 is opposed to a substantial reduction in wages without a strugi It is not certain that the moderate leaderswill bo able to co: the men in their area.In Yorkshire the officials have been advising the men, qu: to accept a temporary agreement; tho unofficial element, however has lately gained strength and is working very hard to promote opposition.In the Midlands there is a good deal of discontent and some of tho men maintain that there must be a big reduction in cost of living before they accept lowerwagos; the miners&apos;, wive Warwickshire and Leicestershire greatly resent the drop in f-ei income owing to the working of the datum line, which, they say, not commensurate with their expenses.On March 21st the Executive of the South Wales minors Federation met at Cardiff and decided to recommend the confereeof/
Q Q 9n ellv1on the South Wales Executive. ! On March 20th George Barker, M.P., said in Abertillery,that he hoped the miners would fight to the very last for a National Wages Board.   Defeat would mean warfare between district and district.   The Triple Alliance should come into action and if it did not function in a crisis like this they should not be locked with such an institution.   At the same meeting Frank Podges stated that they had suffered a great betrayal.   They could lot expect help from the Government or from the owners and if they fivere to take control of the industry and work it themselves their position/)r&amp;of lodge delegates, which will meet to-day, to instruct their representatives at the national conference to vote against district agreements and to insist upon the continuance of the National Wages Board ani the national profits pool.   In spite of this lead, however, a majority of the South Wales miners appears to be reconciled to a reduction in wages.   The steadier men complain, nevertheless, that the suggested cut is too drastic and seem to favour a gradual reduction based upon the price of living. Most of them acknowledge their helplessness as a fighting force and say that they .would be beaten as soon as they began to strike.   In Tonypandy the miners are in a very ugly mood and in the Merthyr and Dowlais valleys, Noah Ablett and S. 0. Davies, the local agents, are conducting propaganda against district settlements. &apos;j In East Glamorgan the activities of Alderman Hubert Jenkins, J.P., have resulted in instructions to the delegates to support district I agreements.The Unofficial Reform Committee has issued a manifesto to every lodge in the South Wales coalfield, urging &quot;the men to stand *l for a National Wages Board, a national pool end retention of flat grates.   It seems likely that this advice will be followed by the majority vote.   Councillor A, J, Cook is urging the men to reject the coal owners&apos; offer; this man is the leader of the extremists
position would be as disastrous as if tho mines remained in the possession of the capitalists.   No one wanted to take over a &quot;bankrupt industry.   The cost of Droduction must he lowered, not necessarily by &amp; reduction in wages but by an increase in production.   They must cake their labour as productive as possible within the seven hours&apos; shift and insist upon the owners improving the technique at the collieries.   He knew exactly how each district stood arid he ventured to say that it would be a calamity of the first order for thern to drift into a two or three weekB&apos; lock-out and then begin negotiating upon what the owners considered to be their ultimate terms.The rebel elements in Lanarkshire and Fife shire threaten to oppose the offer of the coal owners with direct action but it is not certain that they have the numerioal strength necessary to carry on their programme.   In the Wost Lothiane also the unofficial committees are active;   on March 19th and SOth conferences were held in Bathgate and Stoneybum; the latter was attended by about 400 miners end control of the mines by the miners was agreod to be the only solution of the present difficulties.THE COMMUNISTSThe &quot;Release the Prisoners&quot; campaign of the CommunistParty of Great Britain has resulted in a series of meetings inLondon and the provinces at whioh a resolution in the following  !;terms has been passed:&quot;That this MasB Meeting protests against the organised campaign of repression and persecution at present being conducted by the Government against Labour Activities of the British Communist Party in particular.   Further it demands the immediate release of all communists in prison or awaiting trial, and pledges itself to seoure united action on the part of every working-class organisation to compel the Government to refrain from further attaok upon the liberty of Public Assembly and Free Speech.&quot;Acting on instructions from headquarters, the speakersrefrained from using violent language, in fact the speeoheswere unusually moderate.   The meeting in Trafalgar Square musthave/
have been a great disappointment to the promoters, for in spiteof the presence of Tom Marin, Robert Williams, Keil MacLoan, M.P.,J.J. Vaughan and W. Prul, only 500 people were present.   Moneythrown on the plinth amounted to  9./The meeting at Manchester was attended by an audience ofabout 2,000, many&apos; of when were foreigners.   The speakers wereJenkins (Manchester), Robinson (Glasgow), Dingley (Coventry)and Roberts (Onenshaw).   The first named said, in reference tothe Government decision to build four Super-Dreadnoughts:&quot;16,000 wa^e slaves are going to be used in the production of the most hideous machines the world has ever conceived, and when you have aade them, who is going to use them?   Who are they going to be used upon and for what purpose ... I say these vessels should be used against the capitalists of the world if they are used at all.   If these vessels have to be used use them against the reactionary Government and in defence of the Proletariat Government of Russia.&quot;Robinson declared that, &quot;We are out for the complete overthrowof the capitalist system, no matter what steps have to be takento bring it about.&quot;   Dinaley appeared to find his audiencesunresponsive and complained that they were too &quot;respectable&quot;:&quot;Why don&apos;t you arise as working men and women, tho producers of all the things that are produced?   If it is just and legal to pinch our speakers it is just and legal and logical for you to pinch the whole of the Government and the C.I.D. for allowing men, women and children to &apos; starve to death.&quot;The Executive of the Communist&apos; Pvrty of Great Britain is circulating a leaflet givinr details of the cases of revolutionaries who are in prison or awaiting trial.In view of the communist campaign it is of interest to note that a delegate conference of the Midlands branches of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers held at Birmingham on March 19th and 20th unanimously passed a resolu-tion viewing with &quot;the greatest concern the pernicious and disloyal doctrines being preached by the Communist Party&quot; and appealing to the conference &quot;to take steps to counteract the pei3onous propaganda!,One of my correspondents has Deen informed that a f% of the,inner ring of communists are compiling a nap of -theUnited/
tUnited Kingdom which indicates the locality of buildings in I which   food and arms are stored.The oommunists do not appear to be particularly &quot;united! W. Braddock, for instanco, &quot;reports that Dick Beech is one of tho Pie-Cords,   He says the United Communist Party is the rottenest bunch of four flushers and fakirs that ever came down the pike.   I guess it is (Unity at all costs) regardles-of aims and principles.&quot;The Leicester communists are not pleased with the selection of William Gallccher as Parliamentary candidate; they think that a local man should have been chosen and each! of the handful who compose the branch believes that he only is the suitable person.   The report indicates that olio raeetil was acrimonious to a dogree, although it savoured of comedy J one of the would-be candidates is considered mentally deficient even by his comrades.   Stewart, the Midlands organiser, has, however, been informed by the Executive that! Gallacher&apos;s candidature must stand.   J. Binns is now chairmai of the Leicester branch of th* party.The Glasgow Communist Group is seeking to increase its membership by intimidation.   When a new worker starts, he is asked to produce his membership card of the Workers1 Committi If he cannot do so, his life is made unbearable.   The various groups in this area have temporarily joined foroes in connect with the &quot;Release the Prisoners&quot; campaign and great efforts s being made to raise money for the defence of Aldred and his comrades.The extremist press this week has devoted much space to the fiftieth anniversary of the Paris Commune, which has been hailed as a model.THE RED . IKTSRK AT IOMAL Off TRADE .UHIOH3Consequent possibly on a change in policy of Soviet Russia, the British Bureau of this movement is in financial difficulties.   At the meeting in London on March 9th, to
which reference has previously been made, the following report was accepted:&quot;In the present state of the Trade Union movement it has to be recognised that no scheme can be drafted that will make the British Bureau self-supporting from a financial standpoint, but that an attempt should be made to get even the smallest donations.&quot;The report goes on to recommend the issue of an appealto Trade Union branches, signed by Tom Mann, for financial aid, tho appointment of a Finance Committee and an arrangement with the Communist Party for supoort.   If no money is receivedthe Bureau is to be closed down or re-constituted under thecontrol of the Communist Party.   The members are urged to charge their expenses to their Union whenever they can.In accordance with this report, district organisers have been advised that &quot;on March 9th the British Bureau was faced with a serious financial position, the cause of which is due to circumstances over which the Bureau has no control and up to that date had no knowledge of.   It was only after lengthy negotiations that the position was temporarily relieved and the movement saved from complete collapse.   The nature of the work the Bureau is engaged upon will naturally convey to you the possibility cf such crises occurring occasionally and in view of this I am asked to request area organisers to keep expenses down to an irreducible minimum consistent with efficiency and only to undertake such work that shows a possibility of results that warrant the exoenditure.&quot;In spite of the shortage of money, the organisers have ueen very active in issuing manifestoes drafted with considerable ability in such a way as to appeal to the dockers, railwaymen, electricians and other groups of Trade Unionists, to whom they are addressed.On March 20xh, about 500 people attended a Glasgow meeting in connection with the Red International   The chairmanof/
of the Joiners&apos; Strike Committee presided, and Harry Pollitt (London Organiser) and  Lien Wilkinson (British Bureau) who were the speakers,made the usual attack on Capitalism and the Amsterdam International.&quot;The Coming Marino International&quot; is the title of an article in the current issue of &quot;Solidarity&quot; in which it is stated that plans are being made for a red world congress of seamen at Petrograd in August.   The object of the congress will be &quot;to set up an international organisation that is out to take charge of the ships, and transfer tho ocean routes out of the hands of the capitalist octopus and place it beneath the dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;   The movement is obvioJ a branch of the Bed International of Trade Unions, but appears as yet, to have made little headway in this country, although it makes clear the underlying reasons for the recent attacks i ,  Hr. Havelock-Wilson.The latest issues of the boilermakers&apos; and vohiole works; Journals contain appealB to the members to demand the affilial of their unions with the Red International of Trade Unions.VISIT Off THE KING AND QUEEN TO LIVERPOOLMy correspondent sends the following report:&quot;At Aintree the reception given to the Royal visitor was unequalled and during&quot; the visit of Her I1a,iesty the Queen end Princess Mary to various institutions in Liverpool the crowds proved themselves -very patriotic.   I all quarters they were loudly cheered and this was very nronounoed on St. Patrick&apos;s day when hundreds of the Liverpool Irish naraded the streets wearing shamrock, green sashes, etc.&quot;When the Royal procession was passing the end of Scotland Road where hundreds of Irish people wearing Irish emblems had assembled, it was indeed remarkable the way the people cheered the Royal Party.&quot;UPROAR AT EDMONTONExtraordinary scenes occurred at Edmonton on March  2nd owing to the deoision of the District Council not to fly the Union Jack from the Town Hall on Empire Day.   The Council consented, however, to receive a deputation of loyal ex-Servicmen/
men, but before these arrived the public galleries were crowded with rival factions;   a Union Jack carried by an elderly man was torn up and the &quot;Red Flag&quot; sung.   The loyalists far outnumbered the revolutionaries, however, and amidst the cheering of a crowd of several thousands an ex-Service man climbed on to the roof of the Town Hall and tied a Union Jaok to the mast, th8 rope of which had been cut.Tho Town Hall is still apparently in possession of the Unemployed Committee.converted ICTIONSAs a result of the trial of 16 Sinn Poiners in the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh, nine of the prisoners were convicted and seven acquitted.   The sentences were as follows:Bernard IV CabeH.P. Coyle Charles 14&apos;GinnJames BevineMiohan1 GallagherJean Quinn &amp; ) Thomas Gillespie )James Pagan &amp; ) Robert 0&apos;Donnell )Three years&apos; penal servitude and a fine of  500, with an additional term of two years, if the fine be not paid during the first period.Five years&apos; penal servitude.Five yeare* penal servitude, three to run concurrently with the sentence of ten years passed on February 10th.Eighteen months&apos; imprisonment. Three years&apos; pendl servitude.Twelve months eachThree years&apos; penal servitude eachSINN FEIN Ifl GREAT BRITAINarscnThere was an outbreak of Sinn Fein/in the outskirts of London last week, hay-stacks being fired at Sutton, Cheam, Carshalton and Mitcham.. One man has been arrested and a petrol tin containing an inflammable mixture has been found by the police at Palmer&apos;s Green.On March SOth a meeting of the Woolwich branch of theIrish/
- IS -Irish Self-Deterraination League was attended by about 5,000 people.   Councillor R. purcell presided and a resolution was s passed protesting against the internment of Sean MacGrath and Secmus OfKelly.   On the. same day a meeting organised by the South London Irish Freedom Committee was held at Battersea Town Rail.    About 1,000 people were prosent, and thB resolutions mentioned in my last report were passed.    ^Dr. MaoGregor Reid was in the chair, and the speakers included Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, who was introduced as the &quot;future Prime Minister of England&quot;, Commander Kenworthy, who read extracts from the &quot;Weekly Summary&quot; recently mentioned in the Bouse of Commons, and Mr. J. Robertson, M.P,   The collection amounted to  15. 5. 0.   Other Irish meetings have been held in Peckham, in Kingsway Hall and in Chelsea.There seems little doubt that the Irish Self-Determination League and the Gaelic League constitute an excuse for revolutions gatherings at which considerable plotting   occurs.   One of the leaflets recently issued by the Irish Self-Determination League reads as fallows:-VUR IN IRELAND IThe English. Army of Occupation that is waging war in Ireland is not composed of Germans or Turks, it in composed of SNGLJS^O ^SOOTdHiOT. WgLpMEN, Em-TR ,OES^UN tOllTSTS. r rlAOES UN lONIsfs&quot;&apos;OR miC&quot;They are engaged in the MURDER of a NATIONDo you aporove of this work?IF.NOT, STOP IT, _ and_.. .        , ;   , . &apos; STOP IT NOW! n : &apos;        &apos;  :In Liverpool a new Sinn Fein organ entitled the &quot;Self-Determinator&quot; has lately appeared.Irish extremists in South Wales are exploiting the factthat/
367*that tho minors aro bitterly opposed to the payment of income tax, asking &quot;If the Irish workers do not pay income tax why    t do you?&quot;iOn March 13th a procession and open-air meeting in Liverpool were attended by about 3,000 people.   One of the spdukers,       *IMichael McGrath, has since been arrested and is awaiting intern-ment in Ireland.   This gathering followed the refusal of the Chief Constable to sanction a meeting in the Stadium.   A resolu-tion protesting against the attempt of the authorities to deprive-the Irish people of the right of free speech was carried unanimously.In a public house in Bootle last week a man was overheard to say, &quot;There will not be many more fires, wait till we start on th--irailway signals.&quot;Several Irish meetings were held on Tyheside during the1week and there were a few minor disturbances at Jarrow and Gateshead in connection with the St. Patrick1s Day celebrations.In the Glasgow area, binn Fein propaganda has taken the form,  I* Ifchiefly, of concerts.   The women&apos;s side of the movement is beingideveloped very rapidly; members are being trained in first-aid, stretcher-carrying and drill.1IRELAND iTho number of outrages decreased from 358 to 242 but this cannot be taken as indicating any improvement in the conditioniof the country.   Pitched battles, ambushes, bombings and murders are of daily occurrence and there is not the slightest sign of an: weakening on the part of the Irish Republican Army.The areas under Martial Law continue to be the most lawless and disturbed.   The imposition of Martial Law does not appear tohave/
have had any restraining influence on the militant section of the Sinn Fein organisation.The chief difficulty in the administration of the law in Ireland is the oxistenco of a very hostilo and disloyal Press. The hanging or shooting of a convicted felon by British author it, is described as &apos;&apos;raurdor&quot;, the murder of an offender against the laws of Bail ISireann is described as an &quot;execution11.fThe majority of the Irish newspapers are disloyal and the minority afraid to express opinions.   There can bo little progres made in winning over tho people of Ireland so long as tuey are allowed to ..e fed on disloyalty and sedition which are their onlj literary diet.It is reported that dVmnunzio is now meditating a descent upon Ireland as well as the supply of arms secretly to the Irish Republican Army.   Steps have boen taken which it.Is hoped wijl frustrate any attempt of this kind.
