HISTORY   OF   THE   GREAT   YTARSEABORNE TRADE, Vol.     I.*y0. ERNEST FAYLE PRESS    NOTICES.&quot;Mr. Faylefs courage deserves recognition.    It is the f irst time that an historian has attempted such a task, for there is no authoritative statement as to the influence rtiich the Revolutionary, Napoleonic, or other ware had upon economio conditions,    Mr. Fayle has consequently been breaking fresh ground, and he has done so with fine competency. ....    The story which he tells is one to which business men, in particular, will turn with expectations which will not &quot;be disappointed. . . . . . . readers who turn to Mr. C,Ernest Fayle&apos;8 narrative in the hope that they will obtain damning evidence of muddle aand oonfuaion in official oircfibe during the early months of the war, with which he is concerned in this instalment, will not find their craving satisfied.    The volume records, on the contrary, the far-sighted measures which were taken long before the out-break of hostilities to protect the essential sea routes of this country&apos;s commerce&quot;. - Daily Telegraph.&apos;Reading the solid record of wonderful achievement in the early months of the war, when civilisation was shaken to its foundations, crisis threatened, and the full force of the great tragedy pressed home on every heart, the Britisher cannot fail to glow with pride. ..... an invaluable addition to litera-ture on the war, and the mhor&apos;s &quot;execution of his task is admirable&quot;. - The^Financial News.&quot;It is a story of great interest and value alike to the historian and the general reader&quot;. - Yorkshire Observer.&quot;The main interest of Mr. Faylefs book is in its very clear enunciation of the principles upon which the Admiralty18 scheme of defence me based.    This is assisted by some excellent maps, which are issued in a separate case&quot;. - Manchester Guardian.&quot;...the more to be welcomed since it Is essentially a book for the business world, its naval details being kept to the bare margin of necessity for the purposes of the narrative.    No such history of the business side of naval warfare has ever been issued before&quot;.     Daily Express.. &quot;Mr. Fayle has done bin work with thoroughness and can and his book will have permanent value as a work of reference-&quot;.- Sheffield Daily Telegraph.
&quot;The Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence, has done well to dewte a part of the History of the Great War, which is appearing under its direction, to our sea-borne trade, on which our fate and that of the Allies largely depended, . . , . , Mr, Faylefs first volume, relating to the first eight months of the war, is profoundly interesting, , , , he marshals the facts, many of which will be new to the public, in a very able and enlightening narrative&quot;, - The Spectator.&quot;The path of duty was the way to glory, and Mr, Fayle has been successful in creating in hi3 book an atmosphere of duty simply and unswervingly obeyed, ......   There is muchdetail in the book, but the author always remains master of his intricate and rebellious materials, and he tells his complicated story with admirable clearness and lucidity and in such -a manner that a reader without any technical knowledge can understand and enjoy it&quot;, - Glasgow Herald,&quot;Mr, Fayle is excellently qualified by previous practice to collect, to arrange, and to explain all the facts which are relevant to the story of the conduct of seabornecommerce from 1914 to 1918......If we were required toname the one lesson which his volume teaches more than another, the answer vrculd be easy.    It is that this negligent country had, in its confused-looking fashion, thought out the problems it must deal with and had a solution ready.    Its enemies, with all their parade of &quot;scientific&quot; General Staff pagans, had simply ignored the extreme probability (to put it on the lowest footing) that the British Empire must be drawn into the war, and had grossly neglected to provide themselves on a sufficient scale with the one instrument which&apos; offered them a chance of &quot;imposing their will&quot;,      The Times.&quot;History, certainly, will have no doubt as to the great share in the Allied victory that was due to the fact that our seaborne trade was maintained, and Mr, Fayle&apos;s great work - in which he reviews succinctly on the one hand and sums up lucidly on the other   will be of inestimable help to everyone who follows the study of this subject.     It is a book to be studied, but Mr, Fayle&apos;s able treatment of his subject makes the study an easy and to those interested in the subject a delightful one. For a work of its kind it is wonderfully clear&quot;,Liverpool Dally Post and Mercury,&quot;Mr, Fayle has given up ^ood value in his first volume of the seaborne trade section of the history of the great war, ...... The book is accompanied by charts, and iswonderful value for the money.     It deals exhaustively with trade and its protection while subjected to the attacks of surface craft and to the perils of submarine minefields laid by the enemy at the outset in highways of sea traffic.    It deals with &quot;the measures adopted to check panic on the marine insurance market and avert the laying up of shipping, the sweeping of the enemy!s merchant flag from the sea, and the slow strangulation of his foreign trade ,      It deals with our own salvation&quot;,Truth.
&quot;Ur.Fayle has dealt very skilfully and clearly with the great mass of detail which has been available, and he unfolds his story with a lucidity that will appeal to a non-technical reader without belabouring such points an would be already well known among the shipping community......t7e look forward with interest to the second volume,&quot;   Liverpool Journal of Cprimercec&quot;yo have only the first volume so far,, but it is an adequate guarantee for the two, or perhaps more, which areto follow.......   -7e would despair of giving anything like a useful account wit in civ necessarily close limits of what Mr, Fayle records with ample detail and copious illustration........ in the main the nation was equal to the peril.Therefore it saved itself and was the support of its Allies.... whoever wishes to see how it was done (and ever, one of us ought to have that wish) should read Hr. Faylefs first volume now and look for its successors.&quot;   The Field.&quot;In describing the na\ral operations,, Sir Julian Corbett has thrilled us by his vivid pictures of the exciting but shortlived struggle between the powerful belligerents,, The protective and Tone-continued services of the fiavy in distant waters demands equally full description, and Hr* Fayle has proved himself an admirable exponent of the achievements th-t were of equal, if not of greater Import-ance in upholding, the determined defence successfully off&quot;red to the Central lowers coalitionchere so much has boon accomplished the tale is necessarily long; hut it would be a matter for infinite regret if the public wearied of the recital, or the die-distinguished authors failed to sustain the interest attaching to the earlier volumes of the series.   Seldom havo we seen such a happy and harmonious arrangement...... Mr,Fayle&apos;splan is admirably adapted to exhibit all the facts that affected the oc/^tot of seaborne traffic,   His statement of the factors that made for or against the success of surface commerce raid rs Is clear and precise.................   The excellent maps provided are of further assistancein following the development .......   For the me greatlesson learnt from Ur,Fayle&apos;s admirable history is the sufficiency of the English defence to parry the attacks made upon it, and it Is a matter for con ratulation that tho cardinal features of this defence were the results of organ!-sation deliberately planned in time of peace, and made effeo-tive under the exigencies of war.&quot;   &apos; hg/inoerlng.,hOorm\only In the- pas-k the effects of war on the &quot; standard of human life have w-ou either Ignored or only sketchily touched neon.   It is, ngwwer, through tlioir economic effects chiefly that warn shape out their s^compulsory^u^ Since, too, seaborne trade is nor; one of the foremo-st common interests of the wor*ld, and of this country emphatically the greatest material Interest,, how trade was affected by and carried on in the face of assault is an important subject of enquiry....... 1   This volumeis full in its facts, and they are ably and candidly presented.&quot;     Westminster Gazette^
&quot;It is a pleasure to be able to say at once that Mr, Fayle has performed his difficult task wit-  conspicuous success He is the master of a lucid style, and has the rare gift of being able to present a mass of intricate details with clear-ness and precision.   He succeeds in showing hovr shipping f&apos;-:rei in each of the great water-ways of the world, and his story, in spite of the multitude of the details with which it is crowded, is never wanting in lining interest&quot;*   Tablet.&quot;Mr.Fayle has attempted something which has not been done beforee......o it is invaluable to commercial students and all who would understand the practical workings and far-reaching influence of sea power,   Later volumes should provide still more important information for study,&quot; ,. The Scotsman.&quot;A record of indomitable perseverance and of surprising organisation.^ t, As a story it is enthralling.   !tr,Payle has succeeded in being accurate without being dull, a feat whioh is usually above the powers of the official historian.The Organiser^&quot;The story is ably told by Mr.Fayle*.... His method is an admirable one*0.,0 17e congratulate him on a piece of excellently written history,,&quot; - Shipping 7 or Id,&quot;A word of tribute may well be paid to the pdnirable thoroughness wit   which the author has carried out the first instalment of his difficult task.&quot;   - Lloyd&apos;s List.&quot;Mr.Fayle deals with What he aptly terms the cruiser period with all the thoroughness which we expect from an offioial publication.*t,,,.c   Mr*Fayle is to be complimented upon the efficient and complete manner In which his task has been accomplished,   A series of nine maps greatly assist the reader in following the text.&quot;   - Liverpool Couriers&quot; o. o. o^alj who are anxious to get a true conception of the extent to vhich economic conditions were affected by the war at sea will realise that a careful study of r.r.Faylefs contribution to the official history is indispensable, and they will also find the work intensely interesting .......Mr.Payle has produced a work for the compilationcfwhich he was eminently fitted, and which, when complete will unquestionably prove a most valuable section of the official history of the warcil-       Naval and Military Record.
HISTORY   OF   THE   GRRAf   WAR * Based on Official Documents.THE   MERCHANT   NAVYVOX. I.--by-ARCHIBALD HtfRD.PRESS   NOTICES.&quot;Mr, Hurd traces out, step by step, the German war against British commerce, shows it growing more intense aa the war progressed.   Side by aide he desoribes the British counter^ measures, the effectiveness of which depended on the indomit-able spirit of the Merchant Marino.   Never quailing, that in-domitable spirit triumphed in the end.    The development of the Auxiliary Patrol, from the original one hundred trawlers, manned by fishermen with a sprinkling of retired naval officers, until it reached an organisation embracing some 50,000 officers and men, is admirably portrayed in a special chapter devoted   \to the subject........ Mr. Hurd has done great service in presenting to the publio a means whereby it will be able to appreciate the great debt it owes to the Merchant Navy&quot;. -Morning Post.&quot;It might at first si^ht seem as if Mr. Hurdfs section of the history of the war at sea would clash with Mr. Fayle1a. The line of demarcation has, however, been skilfully kept. . . . . . . Mr. Hurd has had the more congenial task allotted to him, and he has carried it out with the sympathy, insight, end ad-miration for his heroes to be expected of one so deeply versed in the sea-lore of his country * both naval and mercantile. . . . . . . The whole method arid strategy of the Admiralty campaign is olearly and logically set forth.   It is a real contribution to historical literature and as such should find a place on the bookshelves of every student of history and of naval warfare.&quot; -Daily News &amp; leader.&quot;Those who are repelled by the matter-of-fact title will miss one of the most fascinating books of sea-adventure ever written.&quot; - Dally Chronicle.&quot;Wisely the decision was ta^en by those in authority that the official history of the Greet V/ar should include the reoord of service of tho Merchant Navy. .... .The official historianis Mr. Archibald Hurd, and there is none better qualified by intimate knowledge of sea conditions and sympathy v; th seamen to tell the great story. ...... The book is a reminder ofanxious days tnat already seem far distant.   Its purpose, how-eve r, is not to revive old pains, but to place on record the great work accomplished by our merchant seamen, now told for thefirst time with ample detail......     a work which willrank high among official histories of the war&quot;. -Daily Telegraph.
&quot;Mr. Hurd writes of these things with the restraint ene looks for in a conscientious historian.    He sets forth the testimony in oaoh oaso olearly and impartially, and oitea,-w evidence which has not been fully substantiated. * . 0 * . * How the Auxiliary Patrol came into being, and the manful service it performed both in keeping down the orop of German mines and frustrating submarine attacks on men-of-war and merchantmen, make a singularly absorbing chapter. ......Having said enough to indicate the powerful appeal which Mr. Hura^e &quot;History&quot; makes to readers of every class, we would like to add our opinion that no one can riso from a perusal cf the volume without feeling renewed confidence in the future of a Merchant Navy which accomplished the immortal-deeds chronicled in these pages&quot;.   - lloyd List.^r. Hurd tells the history of the Auxiliary Patrol r in great detail, but, as he admits, it Is even then little more than half told in the spaoe available&quot;. -Pally Express.&quot;Mr. Archibald Hurd&apos;8 latest and perhaps his greatest work. ...... There is so much told here for tho first time that one hesitates in one&apos;s selection of the new aspects presented, of the misoonoeptions cleared up, cf the secrets revealed, as instances of all that the book willdisplay to the reader.......The real interest lies in the record of the most &quot;silent&quot; navy, the merchant seamen and cargo boats, the men who did not advertise, but who kept these islands and our armies abroad fed, clothed end munitioned.    The trdinarily peaceful men and ships that fought and defeated the terrible U-boat menace.      The &quot;auxiliaries&quot; who brought the American armies to Prance, the men who won tho War.      It is a gallant story of gallant men, gallantly teld&quot;. -   Sunday Times.&quot;The opening volume of Mr. Hurdfs history gives excellent promise of success in the complex but inspiring work that lie3 before him in the volumes to come&quot;. -Sheffield Dally Telegraph.&quot;No man more qualified to write could have been found then Mr. Archibald Hurd, whose knowledge of his Bubjeot, if not actually unique, is hardly likely to be surpassedby any other student of it.......Though this is onlythe first volume of the story it tells us enough to warrant unlimited and unqualified admiration.     The work has a double value, for not only does it concern itself with the actualities of the war but it has a special interest in that it fe-ives an exceedingly informative narrative of the past history of the Merchant Navy, showing that as a matter of fact it is an even older fighting Institution than the Royal Navy itself.&quot; -  Eastern Horning News.&quot;Mr. Hurd&apos;s story of the heraism shown by merchant sailors and fishermen in their confliot with a ruthless foe cannot fail to evo e deep admiration.&quot; - Northern Echo.
&quot;Mr. Kurd needs no introduction as a writer en naval oub-f     jQptS, and he is particularly suited for this aspect of the war J    on account of tho keen appreciation he has alnays shown of the vital importance and def enoelessness of the Merchant Service.,......There is no better portion of the book th-m thedescriptions of this grim hunting, and the other hazardous wcrk of the Auxiliary Patrol.&quot; -    Bristol Times anc5 Mirror.wIt is very fitting that Mr, Kurd should have been selected for this task.   A man intimately acquainted with the Royal liavy, its life, its purpose and the thoughts of its great leaders, he is also a man who, perhaps as much if not more than any other atudent of our sea power and naval greatness, has appreciated the place that the merchant navy occupies in the successful development of the nation and the Empire .... . . . every   one should read his book in order to get a broader view of tho function of the merchant navy - (&quot;the jugular vein cf the nation&quot; as the Prime Minister so graphically described it)     not only in the economic progress of the nation, but as one of our great lines of national defence, viz., the line of &quot;supply1.&quot;    -   Journal of Commerce&quot;Mr. Hurdrs story of how the British merchant seamen was forced into the forefront of the struggle at sea, and of the wonderful way in whioh he carried on in face of the most ruth-less oampaign in maritime annals, is dearly presented .. * . . . . .   Mr. Hurd has done well to inolu&apos;3   In his history a brief but sufficing review of the merchant navy.-&apos;8 work in bygone centuries, particularly in the days of the glory of tho Spanish Main and the long Napoleonic struggle.&quot;         Liverpool Post.&quot;Mr. HurdTs ably written and ably compiled book ...... . * Here all the storieB are retold   retold exceedingly well, of course     and they may be taken as more detailed, more exact, and more informative than they were in any of their previous forms .......   Probably, however, Mr. Hurdlsvt.lume win be valued more for the light whioh it throws on our defensive naval policy during the war than for its storiesof fighting against enemy submarines and mines....... .Kr. Hurd&apos;s &quot;book is of great general, as well as historical value,&quot;         Glasgow Herald.&quot;Mr. Archibald Hurd has a wide knowledge of maritime matters, and is an experienced writer, and, as was only to be expected, he presents an admirable narrative of the stirring events he has to record.&quot;         Aberdeen Free Press.&quot;Mr. Hurd has provided a story that should be in every libnary from land1 s End to the ?ar north Shotlands.   Certainly north of the Tweed it will be read with ever growing pride and admiration, for Scottish vessels and Scottish sailors shared in no small degree in the perils of the sea in those dark days.&quot;Dundee Advertiser.&quot;Mo history of the naval war can be considered satisfac-tory whioh neglects to take into account tho part played by the British mercantile marine.   The task of describing its invaluable services has been entrusted to Mr, Hurd, whose reputation as a student of naval affairs is second to none.   As ho says, the theme is a great one;   and he haB risen to the occasion.&quot;    -     The, Scotsman.
(&apos;)   &quot;Mr. Hard, whose authority upon naval matters is well tapm, has deelt with the subject in a very interesting manner. His--record of the measures ^fcich were taken to meet a menace unforeseen and of ever-varying potentialities, is clear and oomprehensive,&quot; ^Ifryenln^,nTel^reph, &amp; Post, Dundee.&quot;The most novel chajfcir in this volume, and the one with the;newest material, is that which describes the organisation of the a&amp; auxiliary patrol - the trawlers and drifters whioh were the torpeuo-net to protect the rest of the fleet.&quot;   - gegt Africa.&quot;Mr. HurdTs book is well planned and carefully written,ana oromises to do Justice to a worthy subject........V/eshall look with interest for the continuation of Mr. HurdTs valuable and instructive narrative.&quot;    -   Spectator.&quot;Mr. Hurd is no mechanioel &quot;offioial&quot; writer, and he opens ais volume with a very valuable chapter on the iierchant Navy inthe past..........    the events and the needs of the time,In which the merchant Havy was involved, live in his pages asIn no other book yet produced........Mr. Hurd shows abroad grasp of his subject and a keont flair for the essential.I.......The second volume will be awaited with peculiarinterest.&quot;    -    Manchester Guardian.&quot;Of all the war books that have been published,this one i rill probably interest English readors for a Ion er period than anything else?   -   The Graphic.&quot;It is a full, fascinating and authoritive record, to ion has fully Justified the Historical Section of the Committee if Imperial Defenco in selecting Mr. Hurd for the work. Il?he volume, it may be added, is &quot;well illustrated, and contains i three maps and an admirable index. &quot;    -  Aberdeen Journal.&quot;Ho free library should be without this record of Mr. :urdTs.&quot; -    Jaily Herald.&quot;This new book will be found in every ^ay a worthy and itting complement to the other two.&quot;   -  Army &amp; Hary Gazette.&quot;The advent of the ocean-going submarine is the subject if the closing ohapter of the first volume of Mr. Hurd&apos;B ontribution to the official history of the Great war;   and, ike the remainder of the work, it is full of most interesting ad useful information presented in most readable form.    A ozen illustrations from photographs, a number of maps, and an xcellent index give the volume added value.&quot;   -  Naval &amp; Military Record.
&quot;The truth, whioh ought to have been (ana we have no doubt was) obvious from the beginning, is that t5 write a separate beok on the fortunes of the mer-ohant navy in the war without Overlapping Sir Julian CorbettTs &quot;Haval Operations&quot; and Mr. FayleTs &quot;Seaborne Trade&quot; was clean and clearimpossible........r!e oould have dispensed with Mr.HurdT8 introductory chapters on the merchant navy in former wars.   The account is inevitably insufficient for lack of space;   and Mr. Hurd does not show himself quite master of his subject ........   If we aro to have    historicalintroductions they ought to be quite accurate ........The burden which Mr. 2urd has to carry as an historian is that he must needs record events whioh could not vary, and which therefore become monotonous ........    As we read incidentafter incident of the same kind we begin to realise what the threat was whioh hung over all the seafaring men in the world for years.&quot; -   The Times,&quot;Mr, Hur8 knows the present much better than he knows the past, and it was scarcely necessary to deal with the Cinque Ports       and inoidentally to desoribe them quite inaccurately   and then to fellow shipping history through nine oenturles til not very illuminating  fashion.   But onoe he really gets to w*rk mi the war he holds our attention and earns jur gratitude.&quot;Economist.(The last two are the only reviews of either book in any way of an adverse nature,)0
