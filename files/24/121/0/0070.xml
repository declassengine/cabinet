Germany prepared however in her oounter-proposals to go to limit of possibilities which would present themselves in case of material improvement of her(THIS DOCUICTLT IS TH3 PHOSIv^ OP HIS minister.ii!AL,I,lC ^JJ3fYT3 GOTCSSIRtSiTt)0 A B I K B T
economic   capacity in future.   In this hope German Government draw3 up schedule of payments on following basis.(A).   Present value of 42 annuities asked for by Allies in Agreement of January 29th rediscounted at rate of BC$ per annum would total seme thing over 50 milliards gold marks.   Prom this sum is tn be deducted total of what has up till now &quot;been paid by Germany on reparation aocount.   Value of these advances payments estimated by Germany at about 20 millards gold.marks.   Any lesser deduction for reparation so far made would necessitate payments total of which would exceed anything&apos; which might.be reasonably expected from improvement of .Germany1 s.   economic condition.   In   order to as certain, exact value. of all. reparation so far made it would be best to appoint special mixed Commission of Exports.By deducting this value from, pre sent value of annuities, demanded by Paris Agreement,one arrives at total amount of payments which Germany.has still to make, latter amount should be raised .as soon as possible by International loan&amp;..    Since not possible to raise total amount .or even greater part in near future by single International loan one should begin with, financing oart of it.    Germany accordingly proposes issue of loan to largest possible extent, say up to 8 milliards gold marks to be offered for, subscription if possible in all International markets .and to be. exempt from taxes of any kind in all issuing countries. .. Hate of .interest for loan to be as low as possible and amortisation to; begin .af ter .5.. years&apos; with- Vfo and rise to lg$ per.annum..    Germany prepared to. grant, to holders of loan security necessary for its service.   Apart from service of loan Germany for-next five ,years under,? ske to,, .ay&apos;annuity of 1 milliard gold marks.   This to be obverec&apos; in first place by
aeHvo.ries.iii kind ^Ich..i3hj0uld &quot;be base a as much as possible upon free intercourse between Gorman industries and Allied parties interested..   Germany furthermore expresses   gain her readiness to co-operate in work of actual reconstruction of devastated areas.     Value of that &apos;&apos;?ork should be likewise accounted for against annuities.   Amount of Reparation debt of Germany not immediately covers? by the International loan or otherwise shall carry bp interest.   Against   that interest shall be accounted for up to May 1st 1026 the five annuities of 1 milliard gold marks already mentioned.   Amount of interest remaining uncovered shall to added to capital account May 1st 1926 without calculation of compound interest.All further provisions for financing remaining Reparation debt to be reserved for future arrangements especially as regards amortisation-whioh shall not begin before I.-ay 1st 1926. As soon as possible additional instalments to be financed by way o f Inte mat i onal 1 o ans.(jj)     Levy of IPJfc upon German exports obviously meant to grant to Allies participation in any future improvement of Germany&apos;e economic condition.     Principle of giving Allies participation in economic improvement of Germany recognised&quot; as sound.     This principle has been taken into full account even now for foregoing proposals based not on present capacity of Germany but m an estimate which discounts any future improvement that may to reasonably expected.(C)   All payments cessions and deliveries still to be made by Germany and provided for in Part VIII section      1 and annexes and in Part IX Treaty of Versailles to be considered as made.     Sane applies to delivery of proceeds&apos;from destrueted war materials (Article 169) and to obligation undertaken In Part X to. submit to liquidation and retention of German private property in Allied countries Germany1 s obligation to effect restitution under Article 238 to remain untouched.
(h) It is understood by both parties th;-t condition or owing  de a for in Article 431 shall be. considered as fulfilled as soon as all payments defined under (A) shall have boon mflde, Preoh paragraph.In offering fore going proposals understood(l)   that plebiscite in Upper Silesia shall decide in favour of Germany and that consequently Upper Silesia shall remain with Germany.(g)   that 00 miser ce of -crld shall be froe:&apos; from existing impediments and that economic freedom and equality of rights shall be established throughout,     3nds.Simons in his opening statement explaining above mo mo ran-dum criticised in detail proposals of Paris Conference and said that sentiments contained in German memorandum were result of very careful thought on part of economic experts.   German Government had put forward definite figures &quot;because they felt confident that German people would he ready to work harder and submit to greater privations if they could foresee possibility of freeing themselves from indefinite and unknown liabilities.Prime Minister stated on behalf of Allies that statement made by Simons showed such lack of comprehension of actualities of case that Allies did not think it merited any discussion or examination,     Therefore Allied representatives   proposed to confer same afternoon to decide vbat course should be taken and another Conference&apos; could be held liarch 2nd,   Ee r*as expressing unanimous vie-rs of Allied representatives upon exposition given by Simons,     Ends,*
Secretary of State for &quot;Colonies to&apos;Gv. rernors General of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South - Africa.3rd &quot;larch 1921.Mith reference to my telegram of March 2nd,    Following for your Prime Minister.     Begins.     Secret Allied Conferences *n German counter-proposal to Paris proposals occupied the whole of after-noon of &apos;&apos;larch 1st and all March 2nd0   evidence nee was produced that inadequacy of German proposal was due partly to a belief that it was good tactics to minimise their offer and partly to pressure by German industrial magnates and Prussian reactionaries on German Government.     Allies had reason to believe also that German Government could make no adequate offer except under strongest allied pressure.     The Allies, however, agreed that the German proposal which was little more than a quarter of the Paris proposal was totally inadequate and even as a basis of discussion could not be accepted.     Allies decided, therefore, that it was essential to bring strongest pressure to bear upon &quot;Germany immediately to compel \x seriously to face its obliga-tions.   They were agreed that without it German public opinion woul^ never permit the German Government to make adequate reparation and that Germany would have succeeded in undermining whole basis of Treaty itself unless Allies showed united deter-mination to enforce the Treaty of Versailles immediately in the matter of reparations, to the maximum of Germany&apos;s capacity. The French Government considered that as regards the sanctions to be applied the most effective sanction was immediate military occupation of a new part of Germany.   The Prime Minister considered that military movements should be reduced to the minimum and that if they could be made effective economic sanctions were preferable,     The Italian Representative was fearful   about the effects of drastic action in dislocating Europe and with his Japanese colleague was inclined to delay.&apos;    He said ho would

Ho extra troops will b^ required for this.

He also made it clear that Germany was willing to make further con-cessions and the Prime Minister and ILBriand accordinglyagreed that the German and Allied experts, with a view to-7-
finding out whether it was possible to agree upon a basis which the Allies could accept,-Should have a private meeting during week-end.   During tha week-end, howo-jer, it became clear on the o e hand, that  the Gorman Delegation was not in a position to make n firm offer which the   llias could accept ando n the other, news had been receive 1 from Paris by the French XKlecation that Parliament and yablic opinion there, was vehemently opposed to making any further con-cessions except in form to Germany*   Accordingly, at yestor-day&apos;s Meeting, after Dr.Simons had made in reply to the Prime Minister&apos;3 speech of Tuesday last a long statement justifying the German point of view and making certain advane.es     on their previous offer, it was decided by the Allies that the. offer was not sufficient and that it was necessary to bring the sanctions into effect at once,    The Prime Minister pointed out to Dr.Simons that his offer really left the whole question quite indefinite, and that what, the Allies and the world really wanted was finality. Dr.Simons had offered to accept the Paris terms for the first five years, but even this wa3 on certain conditions, notably that the plebiscite in Silesia went in favour of Germany.   In regard to later period, he had made no subatan-tial offer.   The Prime Minister further said that the condition of any agreement with the Allies ma (a) that the amount of the payments e ed by Germany or factors which would (letermine from year to year what these payments should be, (b) that the actual node of payment must be definitely settled now.

Reparation.   Sanction B,   Your telegrams; of March 3rd,March 11th. and March 14th.   It would appearthat assumption upon which approval of Commonwealth V Government was based as set out in my telegram of March 7ththat the fifty per cent collected would be paid into a pool to be distributed among Allies in proportions agreed
-   427%Q inter se, was unfounded&apos;and that it is intended that each Allied nation shall retain all moneys collected in this way for its own use.   Commonwealth Government is of opinion that principle is wrong and that its a plica-tion Is certainly calculated to prejudice Australian Interests.   I have explained already that Commonwealth policy prohibits German imports but apart from this a large proportion of Gorman goods coning into Australia before the war, were re-exported to Australia from Britain. It is gathered from your telegram that monies collected in respect of these would be retained by Britain.   And as in any case amount of moneys collected under Sanction B would depend upon the voliuae of German irm rfcs and as these must necessarily displace Australian goods or goods from other countries - mainly from Britain - Commonwealth Govern-ment cannot approve It.     Hughes ends.GOVERN CP GENERAL,X.11Secretary of State for Colonies to Governor ,   General of Canada.13th March, 1921.Secret.   Following for your Prime Minister in reply to your telegram of 11th liarch begins.   Allies invited the opinion of a   Committee of Allied Jurists as to their legal&quot;rights before deciding to enforce the sanctions.     They were advised by the Committee that Germany&apos;had defaulted in execution of nreaty in certain important respects, notably trial of war criminals, disarmament and certain other matters and in the opinioi of the Allies the decisive point was, however, the German reply to the proposals put forward by tho Allies at Pari^ which ^ero estimated to be a mitigation by about 50f of Treaty Clauses in regard to reparation.     In theircounter-propos&quot;Is the Germans offered something between-11- .
rnie-c[uarter and--one-third of&quot;T^is&quot;*,propoG&amp;l j&apos;^ course of the negotiations declared their inability to go substantially further.   The Allies were thus confronted by decision on part of German relegation that it would not pay more than a fraction of its Treaty obligations, and they agreed t?:at thl \ fraction wa3 30 inadequate that it could not form even a basis for discussion.     In thaif o AnloriJ . this constituted a definite attempt en the pn&amp;t of Germany to destroy one of most vital chapters of Treaty of Versailles and so nullify Treaty itself.   They therefore decided that, not only on legal grounds advanced by jurists, but on the more general grounc   that German attitude was a declaration of their intention to default, it was necessary for them to take I mediate atcps to hold Germany to performance of its obligations under the Treaty be brining home to thoGerman Government and people the determination of the Allies that they should.not be allowed, to evade their obligations end.
