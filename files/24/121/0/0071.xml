!THIS JOCUjMT^IS^THF, property OF HIS BRITANNIC maJ5STY*S GOVERNMENT) *C.P.2770.CABINET.POLICY IN THE MIDDLE ist .P \ POF A &quot;: from Mr. Churchill to theFri:ne Minister.(Received Colonial Office 7.20 pm. 23rd March, 1921). (Reference Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 5.)Part One.Am much obliged both to you and-to the Cabinet for approval to general policy wo propose to puraue in Middle East which has been given.     Sir P. Cox does not see any difficulty in proceeding according to lines of Cabinet suggestion but attaches great importance (? &quot;to Feisal!sw omitted) arrival in Mesopotamia before election takes place.    This can presumably be arranged as a result of appeals and invitations to him from his powerful and numerous religious and racial supporters in the Iraq.    With other observations of the Cabinet in regard to this part of the subject j am in agreement and we will bear them Carefully in mind.Part Two.Am not quite clear Aether it is contemplated that someone in London should at ?nce approach Feisal. I think it would be. better were Lawrence who has his entireconfidence to send him the-private telegram appended strictly within limits of which you&apos;&apos;have approved.     This really is more non-committal (rthan) an official communication and it will coming from Lawrence be quite sufficient. Feisal will then proceed to Mecca and Lawrence at some point on the route will have to talk with him quietly.
Part Three3About Trans-Jordania..  I do not seem to have made myself quite clear.    We do not expect or particularly desire indeed Abdullah himself to undertake Governorship,    He will as Cabinet rightly apprehend almost certainly think it too small and we shall -  &apos; o it as (one group undec:) as possible.     But that his influence should be upon our side and that. (?person) elected for local Governorship shall be one in whose nomination he has cordially concurred is the vital point.    Abdullah has power to do a great deal of harm particularly against French in Trans-Jordania and if he become actively hostile we should have no means of coping with him a     The actual solution which we have always had in mind and for which I shall work is that you described as fellows &quot;While preserving Arab character of area and administration to treat it as Arab province or adjunct of Palestine&quot;&apos;Political affairs ought to be very favourable, if this could be achived under an Arab local Governor agreed upon between us and Abdullah and cordially backed by himt But (?with) every one here military and political alike I must emphasise certainty that without presence of a small British force no order or stability of Government can be established in Trans-J&quot;ordania4     In favourable conditions which we anticipate a single squadron might be Sufficient for local purposes.     The reason why It is necessary to have larger numbers is solely because General Congreve Commander in Chief and General Radcliffe representing General Staff properly insist that force must be capable in all eventualities of looking after itselfP    Both these Officers are agree! that on lines proposed no rieks would be run.    With Intention to reduce further oar military
commitments in Palestine as elsewhere in Middle East I am in hearty sympathy and I tthink (that I) have given proof of this.     But after hearing unanimous opinion of everyone concerned here including most particularly Sir Herbert Samuel (?S) actual political drficers on the spot I am can-vinced that restoration of stable conditions in Trans-jordania is an indispensable preliminary to further reduction.     I may add that a by nr. means inappreciable revenue can be used in Trans-Jordania in such conditions.     Civil Government will be ne additional charge to Palestine or to His Majestyfs Government.    Lastly we must remember that in Trans-Jordania we have accepted international responsibilities and ought to take reasonable steps to discharge our undertaking...   Otherwise when French say &quot;will ycu allow us to cone in and punish people who are &quot;preparing to attack us in our own territory.    Keep order &quot;yourselves or let us do it for you&quot;, what is our answer.From our side of the line of partition Arabs have already (two groups undec:) and blown up French Railway bridge and French aeroplanes on the other hand have dropped retaliatory bombs on flocks of Gilead.    This lamentable situation must be brought to an end.Part FOuroGeneral Gouraud, now. on his way to. Syria   has . expressed a (?desire) to see me at Jerusalem on 29th. 1 shall confine myself as regards Mesopotamia and Feisal to reiterating that choice of a ruler must rest with people of Ifaq and that we cannot in advance undertake to rule out any candidate whom they desire and whom we do , not consider undesirable..     I shall at the same time say   .that nothing has been or&apos;can be settled at present.....untilwishes of Mesopotamian people have been fully expressed and on this I shall point out local /candidates who are in
: NOTE BY THE COLONIAL OFFICE,  -   , v. &apos;: Action has boon u,..:..n on parts 2 and 5 of this. telegram with the authorisation of the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon.24,3121 *Whitehall. Gardens, S..W.&apos;, March 28th, 1921,., ...the field and other candidates who are nsw pressing their claims.About Trans-Jordania as result 6f my interview w&apos;th Abdullah I hope to be able to give general sf+satisfactory assurances of our intention to do all m can for ^reservation of order on French borders and to prevent French -from being disturbed and annoyed from out of our territory.    That they have themselves been tentatively in communication with Abdullah there is some reason t* believe. v-After my interviews with Abdullah I will telegraph to you further and J do not require any further Instructions at present time unless you,wish to send me any.Part F1 ve. (attdressed to Private Secretary, Colonial Office.)Show the following message to the Prime Ministerand should he agree have it delivered to Feisal preferablyby Forbes Adam begins Following from Lawrence for Feisalthings have gone exactly as hoped.    Please st$rt for Meccaat once by quickest possible route leaving Haddad temporarily*as Hedjaz representative In London.
