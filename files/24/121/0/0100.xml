\ 1)       jem3 p9cfjji&quot;icirl: ; 5 2793   )J)       hiera tne Secretary of State for India,secret.:it.I circulate to my colleagues a copy oi a telegram I have received from the Viceroy with reference to the Esher Report.K. S. iiFrom Viceroy, Anno Department, to Secretary of State for India,mh March 1021.483.   Reference our telegram dated 10th February 1921, No. 10-1. At meeting of Legislative Assembly on 28th, following resolutions relating to Esher committee&apos;s Report were passed : (1) (A) That the purpose of the Army in India must be held to be the defence of India against external aggression and the maintenance of internal peace and tranquillity. To the extent to which it is necessary for India to maintain an Army for these purposes, its organisation, equipment and administration should be thoroughly up to date and with due regard lo Indian conditions, in accordance with present day standards of efficiency in the British Army, so that when the Army in India has to co-operate with the British Army on any occasion, there may be no dissimilarities of organisation, &amp;c., which would render such co-operation difficult.. For any purpose other than that mentioned in the first sentence, the obligations resting on India should be not more onerous than those resting on the self-governing Dominions, and should be undertaken subject to the same conditions as are applicable to those Dominions. (13) To repudiate the assumptions underlying the whole report of the Esher Committee : (1) that the administration of the Army in India cannot be considered otherwise than as part of the total armed forces of the Empire, and(2) that the military resources of India should be developed in a manner suited to Imperial necessities.(4) That the Army in India should not as a rule be employed for service outside the external frontiers of India except for purely defensive purpose or with the previous consent of the Governor-General in Council in very grave emergencies, provided that this resolution does not preclude the employment on garrison duties overseas of Indian troops at the expense of His A!ajesty&apos;s Government and with the consent of the Government of India.(16) That the proposal of the majority of the Esher Committee for the creation of a separate department for production and provision under a member of the Executive Council be not accepted, and that the proposal of the minority, namely, that the responsibility should be entrusted to a Surveyor-General of Supply, who would be a civil member of the Coiumander-in-Chiefs Military Council, be accepted. This would seem to have the merit of being more logical and economical, and would have the further advantage of avoiding the addition of a civil member to the Executive Council in connection with military administration.(20) (A) That the Commander-in-Chief and the Chief of the General Staff in India should be appointed by the Cabinet on the nomination of the Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government of India and the Secretary of State for War.(B) In the case of Army Commanders who are officers of the Indian Army, theappointment should be by the Secretary of State for India on the nomination of the Government of India.(C) Appointments to the offices mentioned against SerialNos. 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12(Report Schedule annexed to Section VI.)1 should be made in the manner proposed for Army Commanders.1 These are as follows: No. 3, District Commanders and commands tenable by Major-Generals; No. 6. Adjutant-General in India ; No. 7 : Quartermaster-General in India; No. 8, Director of Medical Services; No. 10, Major-Generals in charge of administration; No. 12, Brigadiers-General, Genoral Staff.3690     100  4.21
(D) The appointment of Secretary in the Military Department, India Office, should be made by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the Government of India and after advice obtained from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He should c.c officio have the status of a Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos; and should have the right of attending the meetings of the Army Council when questions affecting India are discussed. lie should not be under the orders of the Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos;.(22) That the Commander -in-Chief s right of correspondence wiih tho Chief of the imperial General Stall should be subject to the restriction that it does not commit the Government of India to any pecuniary responsibility or any line of military policy which has not already been the subject of decision by them, copies of all such correspondence at both ends being immediately furnished to the Government of India and the Secretary of State for India.(25) (A) That the King-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to all arms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air Forces in India and the Ancillary Services and the Auxiliary forces. That every encouragement should be given to Indians, including the educated middle classes, subject to tbe prescribed standard of fitness, to miter the commissioned ranks of the Army, and that in nominating candidates for the entrance examination, unofficial Indians should be associated with the nominating authority, and in granting King&apos;s Commissions, after giving full regard to the claims to promotion of officers of the Indian Army who already hold the corn-mission of His Excellency the Viceroy, the rest of the commissions granted should be given to Cadets trained at Sandhurst. The general ride in selecting candidates lor this training should be that a large majority of the selections should be from the communities which furnish recruits and as far as possible in proportion to the numbers in which they furnish such recruits.(B) That not less than 25 per cent, of the Kings Commissions granted every year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.(31) (A) That adequate facilities should be provided in India for the preliminary training of Indians to lit them to enter the I loyal Military College, Sandhurst.(Bj That as soon as funds be available, steps should be taken to establish in India a Military College such as Sandhurst, and the desirability of establishing&apos; (? in India) training and. educational institutions for other branches of the Army should be steadily kept in view.(35) That in the interests of economy and in view of the likelihood of the growth of the Indian element in the commissioned ranks, it is essential that before vested interests arise, the pay of all commissioned ranks in all branches of the army should be fixed on an Indian basis, with an overseas allowance in the case of British officers and with a similar allowance for Indian officers holding the King&apos;s commission when serving overseas.(36) That in view of the need for the preparation of India to undertake the burden of self-defence, and in the interests of economy, it is essential that a serious effort-should be made (A) to organise and encourage the formation of an adequate Territorial Force onattractive conditions;(B) to introduce in the Indian Army a system of short colour service, followedby a few years in the reserve ;(C) to carry out a gradual and prudent reduction in the ratio of the British tothe Indian troops.(38) That officers in the Indian Territorial Force should have the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, Lieutenant or higher rank, as the case may be, and that no distinction should be made between the Indian Territorial Force and Indian Auxiliary Force in respect of the authority which signs the commissions, and that officers in these two forces should take rank inter se according to dates of appointment.(39) That no proposal for interchange of officers between the British and Indian Service should be carried out unless the following conditions are satisfied.: (A) That the cost to Indian revenues should not be thereby appreciably increased.
(B) That such proposals should not be allowed to interfere with a steadyexpansion in the proportion of King&apos;s commissions thrown open  to Indians in the Indian Army.(C) That the interchange of British officers should in no way alfect the control ofthe Government of India over the entire Army in India.&apos;K40) That having regard to tho creation of two additional commands in India, the Government of India do consider the expediency of reducing the size of the Administrative Stall&quot; at Army Headquarters.(41) That as soon as the external and internal conditions of India permit, the Governor-General in Council should, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, appoint a Committee adequately representative of non-official Indian opinion for the purpose of examining and reporting upon (A) the best method of giving effect to the natural rights and aspirations of thepeople ol India to take an honourable part in the defence of their country, ami prepare the country for the attainment of full responsible government, which has been declared to be the goal of British policy;(B) the financial capacity of India to bear the burden of military expenditure;(C) her claim to equality of status and treatment with the Self-GoverningDominions, and(D) the methods of recruitment to the commissioned ranks of the Indian Army.(44) That Anglo-Indians should be included in the terms Indian subjects or Indians, wherever such terms occur in the above resolutions.(45) This Assembly expresses no opinion on such of the recommendations of the Report of the Esher Committee as have not been dealt with in the foregoing resolutions.Following resolution was negatived : &apos;(10) That the absence of full responsible government in India, the differences in conditions between India and England, and the provisions of the Government of [ndia Act do not warrant differentiation of the Army Administration between India and England, in regard to the ultimate control of, and responsibility for the defence of the country, and that, in view of the desirability of assimilating the system of administration in India to that in the United Kingdom, which has been arrived at after prolonged experiments, and the desirability of emphasising the principle of the ultimate supremacy of the civil power, it is essential that the Commander-in-Chief should, without prejudice to his official precedence, cease to be a member of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council, and that the portfolio of defence, including supply, should be entrusted to a civilian member of the Executive Council, assisted by an Army Council, including the Commander-in-Chief and other high military experts, and a certain number of civilians, more or less ou the model of the Army Council in England.Government refrained from giving Assembly any guidance on this resolution or on No. 16.
