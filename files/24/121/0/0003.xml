r/in I   I   A  -      9U(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRI1ANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S. GOVERNMENT).SECRET* CABINET,CP.2703. LIGHT RAILWAYS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment.     (Ref: CP.2690).Those schemes were submitted to mo last February but I was unable to sanction them as it appeared to me that their adoption would run directly counter to the policy of the Government with regard to the restriction of public expenditure.They are now put forward again on the ground that they would provide work for the unemployed.    On this I would observe -(1)   there is no provision in the 1921/22 Estimates for funds for Light Railways and a Supplementary Estimate would be required if the schemes were carried out.(2)   the suggestion in tho last paragraph of the Minister of Labour&apos;&amp; memorandum that out of the provision for transportation schemes on tho Ministry of Transport Vote for 1980/21 a Government subscription should be made to the promoting companies before the end of the financial year ia quite impracticable.    I do not gather that the promoters are yet vested with any statutory powers, and in any oase it is oontrary to normal and sound procedure to make grants of public money for Light Railways before the completion of a portion of the lines, the value of which should bo equivalent to the amount of financial assistance afforded by the Government.(Z)   the oost of the two schemes is estimated at  327,000 and  189,000 respectively, and the amounts likely
to be spent on direot labour are stated to be approzimat^y 110,000 and  30,000.    Apparently the Gcfvernmsnt may beasked to contribute  180,000 plus  159,000 s  519,000,The expenditure of this largo sum appears totally disproportionate-tionate to the relief likely to be afforded to unemployment and is altogether out of relation with the measure of assistance given to Local Authorities&apos; scheme a under the St, Davids&apos;Committee which contributes only 60 per cent of the cost oflabour,(4)   It is most important that, if assistance is to be given to bodies other than Local Authorities for the furtherance of schemes of the nature of public utility schemes, theso bodies should not be treated more favourably than Local Authorities are by the St, Davids&apos; Committee,     If they were, the Local Authorities would Immediately clamour for equally favourable treatment.For these reasons I do not think that the recommendations of the Unemployment Committee should bo approved,(Intd)   A.C.treasury, S.VJ,March 11th 1921,
