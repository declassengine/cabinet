Your Excellency is well aware of these feelings, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here ; still, we may be permitted to submit that the question of Khihifat, of holy places and sacred shrines is iudissol 11 lily connected with the Turkish Treaty.The majority of the Moslems of the world recognise Mis Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey as their Khalifa, and the whole Moslem world considers him as &quot; Khaditu&apos;&quot; of &quot; HarnuviiHiS&apos;Shaveefaii,&apos;&apos; and the custodian of holy shrines ; according to the tenets, the Khalifa must be so independent and strong as to be able to defend the holy places.We, the representatives of the people, therefore humbly pray that for the happiness and contentment of His Majesty&apos;s loyal subjects it is necessary that the final treaty should I jo so moulded as to be in accordance with the pledges given by the Premier and in consonance with the religious demands of the Moslems of India.We cannot refrain from deeply regretting thai our just and legitimate demands have been ignored for the benefit of tho Greeh nation, which has never stood loyally to the allies of His Majesty, and whose sacrifices are nil as compared to what India did at the great hour of trial.We respectfully yet firmly submit before Your Excellency that if at such an opportune lime our representations are not given due weight, the reaction in the minds of the Indian people would be further accentuated.We earnestly hope that the old friendly relations between the two Great Powers will be renewed and maintained to the best, and mutual advantage of both.We again thank Your Excellency for the gracious hearing, and beg to assure His Majesty the King-Emperor, through Your Excellency, of our deep attachment to his person and of our loyal co-operation with his Government, and to submit that it is in that spirit alone that we have ventured to approach Your Excellency to-day.His Excellences Reply.G extf.em en,I am very glad to meet you this morning and to receive your loyal address. You will readily understand that I cannot deal with the statements contained in it, or give you any assurance beyond this, that I will forward your address to the Government of India with a request that it may be forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State ; and in so doing I will convey to the Government of India how deep is the feeling on the subject amongst the Mussulmans in this province, and how loyal and helpful as a body they have been under conditions of trial. As for myself, you can count on the support which I have consistently given to your community for many years.
