WEEKLY SURVEY OF THE STATE OF IRELAND FOR WEEK ENDED MARCH 21st, 1921.

(Circulated by the Chief Secretary for Ireland).



I submit for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 21st instant.



GENERAL STATE OF THE COUNTRY.

Statistics of Outrages.

I regret to state that the outstanding future of the Return of Outrages for the work is the number of casualties sustained by the Crown Forces, which reached the highest figure (45) recorded since the Easter Rebellion of 1916. Ambushes and other attacks by rebel forces were not more frequent than in recent weeks, but several of the engagements were on an exceptionally large scale. The most notable encounter of the week took place near Crossberry, Bandon District, Co. Cork, on the 19th instant. A body of Military and Police were operating on foot at some little distance from their transport when the small party left in charge of the transport were fiercely attacked and before the main body could come to their assistance the rebels succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties upon them and in burning the transport. On the arrival of the main body and other reinforcements the rebels were vigorously engaged and were eventually driven off with the loss of at least six of their number killed and seven wounded, but 
the casualties to the Crown Forces were I regret to state even more severe, eight military (other ranks) and one policeman being killed and five military (three officers and two other ranks) and one policeman wounded. Six unwounded prisoners were captured by the Crown Forces together with a quantity of arms and ammunition. Another ambush which occurred on the same day near Dungarvan, Co. Waterford resulted in desultory fighting extending from 2 p.m. until 8 p.m. in which the rebel casualties are estimated to have exceeded thirty including at least seven killed. On the Crown side one Auxiliary policeman was seriously wounded and has since died. Another policeman, a Sergeant of the R.I.C. fell into the hands of the rebels and his body was subsequently found riddled with bullets, and bearing a label with the word "executed" written upon it.

No less than six ambushes took place in the streets of Dublin during the week. In one of these attacks, which occurred about 8.15 p.m. on the 14th instant, when a party of Auxiliary Police were fired upon in Gt. Brunswick Street, five cadets were wounded (two mortally) and three civilians, two of whom were probably among the assailants, were killed. On the 15th instants military despatch rider was shot dead while proceeding by motor cycle across the Rialto Bridge, and on the 19th instant, two soldiers were killed and six wounded by a bomb thrown into a lorry in Aungier Street. In consequence of these repeated attacks the hours of Curfew in the City of Dublin has been further extended, and are now fixed to begin at 8 p.m.

Four attacks on occupied Police Barracks took place during the week but were in each case unsuccessful, and resulted in no casualties to the Police Garrison.

One Courthouse (Killagan, Co. Antrim) was destroyed. Minor outrages for the week included 3 raids for arms and 27 raids   
on mails,Arrests f&amp;r outrages and political offences numbered 31 for the week (exclusive of prisoners taken in armed conflicts) 2-Fie:is of Civilians by Court Martie 1Fifty-six trials of civilians by Court.Martial were concluded during the week.

PBEg?::? STATE 0? POLITICAL OPIIttOS III IR^LAKD.,Alth5u.mii the ordinary incidents of British political- life attract little attention in Ireland at the present tire, the retirement of It. Bonar Law had the effect of re-awakening for the moment the interest of the Iris&quot;&quot; public in affairs at Vestminster, ancl there vaa much speculation as to its posnible consequences upon the Gove^rment1b Irish policy.   The late Unionist Leader&apos;3 former associations wit.... the Ulster resist-ance to the Home Rule Aot cf 1914 had made him the object of bitter animosity and suspicion wit1 Southern Irishmen by whom he was wrongly credited with bein^ an uncompromising opponent of all concessions to nationalist sentiment.   There was at first Borne disposition in the anti-Government press to connect his retirement with the Irish situation but this theory would now appear to have been discarded.(Intld.)   H.G;Irish Office, S.17. 26th harch, 1921.
