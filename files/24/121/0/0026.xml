T.J.M.Ministry of Labour, 16/3/31.QUESTIONS&amp;S8.

representations in growing volume have been received against pressing forward unduly with the eotabliBhment of new Trade Boards, on the ground that unemployment, bad enough aa it ie, would be thereby made worse.    Itnas been my duty to consider these representations very seriously and proceed with caution.     It is this fact that has led to the notices referred to in Questions 28 and 35.For the information of my hon. Friends I may say that Orders have already been made to apply the Trade Boards Acts to tho following trades J-The Fish Distributive Trade.The Fruit Dietributive Traclo.Tho HairdreBsing Trade.The Boot and Floor Polish Manufacture trade.The Whip Making Trade. In these cases we are now proceeding with the neceseary Appointments and Regulations.Notice of Intention to apply the Acts has been given in theMoat Distributive Trade, and the Lace Warehousing and Finishing Trade. Unless the volume of objections causes mo to re-consider the situation, - and I may say I have reoeived a number from the Heat Distributive Trade - I should propose to issue an Order in duo course applying the Trade Boards ActB in these cases.A considerable amount of investigation prior to formal action has been carrlod out in a number of trades, Inoluding tho Catering Trade.    In these oasos I have not yet completed tho work of investigation.As regards the Investigating Officers under notioo of discharge, I explained last week in reply to the hon.A? amber
Member for South Islington why reductions have beenneoeasary - a reason rehearsed in the opening part of thisanswer.     I need not repeat that every endeavour will bemade to find these offioors other employment, and in replyto my Hon. and Gallant Friend tho november for Bradford tEast, I should say that it is not the oase that women are being retained to replace ex-offloors.
