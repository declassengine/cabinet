Hon. Sir Eric Geudes, m,p.,g.b;e-.g-o.b. Ministry of Transport, 6 Whitehall Gardens,o * .1.x.Dear Sir Eric,Shortly after tho commencement of tho Bailway Strike in September 1919 a Circular was issued to the staff on the following lines:-&quot;Circular to the Staff. PROTECTION Off LOYAL EMPLOYEES. &quot;In view of the present labour unrest the Government desire to make it clear that in the event of a strike of Railwaymen they, undertake not only to afford to men
who remain at mrl protection, but also tosafeguard their interests as Railwayman againstsny measures or&quot;prejudice to which theymay thereafter be exposed oh account of suohaction,&quot;It has been pointed out that as this Circular Letter was issued after the striics commenced it had little effect, and it is suggested that if a similar Circular, was prepared and sent to the stations for issue to the men as soon as any decision to call them out.has been arrived at, it might serve a very useful purpose.   Of course it entirely depends on whether the Government is prepared to give the undertaking referred to in the Circular Letter;   if they are, I think it would be as well to tell the Companies to get the Circular Letter ready and to make arrangements for it to be handed to the members of the staff immediately   the emergency arises.   Do you agree please?Yours faithfully. (8 i gne 3.)     H * A u WALKER
