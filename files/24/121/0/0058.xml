:S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0.t&quot; HIS HRITAfliilO MAJESTY13 OOVBRHMBJHT.IE C RE T.P.2758,OABIHE T.Temporary Stoppage of -York by Dublin Post Office Staffon March 14th, Ig l. Suggostod   Disciplinary  Action,Memorandum by tho ASBiBtant-flcBtniastor-Groneral..1.,   On Monday,. March 14th, the greater part of tho Post Office staff on duty in Dublin, to a number of approximately 890&apos;, loft work from 8.30 to 11 a.m. under tho instructions of their -local Trade Unions, who in turn acted at tho instigation of the National Executive of the Irish Labour party, as a protest against-tho execution of six rebels.2.. The question whether any disciplinary uoasures should be takon^ is submitted to tho Cabinet for decision.   It should be mentioned that a similar strike took place in April 1920 as part of a Labour demonstration on behalf of hunger-strikers.3.   The position in Dublin on this and similar occasions presents exceptional features -(a) As far. as men working out of doors are concerned, e,g. postmen,- they could reasonably allege that an attempt to performtheir duties would expose them to violence.    In fact even ifattended for duty, the mails would probably have had they had/to,, be withheld in central Dublin owing to the danger, of looting./h) The female staff e.g, telephonists, could hardly be expected to run the gauntlet of the pickets.     There is evidence in fact that some of.the $iris did attend and were forcibly prevented from entering the Exchanges.(o) On such occasions it is necessary to lock the doois o:: some offices to prevent sabotage, and if disciplinary measures. - we:e&apos;
were taken there would be great difficulty in distinguishing between Den who failed to attend and those who attended but failed-to get in.4.   On 14th Maroh the aotion of the staff did not in faot aause any material delay to the mails, because in some cases the trains were not running and none of the mail carts provided by Contractors put in an appearance.    A nucleus staff, mainly corn-posed of Supervising officers, was maintained at the Telegraph Office and was sufficient to deal with Government and some of the ordinary traffic.    Similar conditions prevailed at the Telephone Exchange.5.   The Chief Secretary has suggested that a warning should be issued, in the event of a similar occurrence, that any of the staff failing to attend would be dismissed the Service.    Such a warning would almost certainly have little or no deterrent effect because in the event of their ignoring the call of the Labour party, the Post Office Unions would ee expelled and lose their position in the Irish Labour movement, and if the staff attended they would be subjected to intimidation and possibly violence.It would therefore probably become necessary to enforce the threat.    This would no doubt be followed      a strike by the rest of the Irish Post Office staff (excluding r^rhaps the Northern Country), and as substitutes would be unobtainable the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone servioes in Ireland would have to be shut down.    A nucleus service for Government communica-tions might perhaps be maintained by the Military Authorities, but they could not provide for civilian requirements.6.   It must also be remembered that the postmen and certain other grades are members of the English Union, and that a oon-fliot between the Irish branohes and the Government leading to an Irish strike, might be followed by sympathetic action in England.- 2 -
7.   The danger of allowing such proceedings on the &quot;part-of -Civil Servants to pass unnoticed is recognised, but the exceptional conditions prevailing in Ireland would preclude its effective use as a precedent, and it is submitted that having regard to the probability that drastic action would result in a oomplete stoppage of Postal services in Ireland, the wisest course would be to confine the penalty to a stoppage of pay during the period of absence.(Sgdi       H.
