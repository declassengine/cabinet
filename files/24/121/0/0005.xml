iTi IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRJTABNIC MAJESTY1S GOVKimiElIT) * 17? &apos;CABINET. pour AMERICAN DEBT AND SURROGATED SECURITIES, Ker.ore.ndum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Treasury Deposit Scheme provides for the return of all securities borrowed thereunder to their owners by 51st March; 1922, or in default payment of the price at the time of deposit plus a bonus of 5$cSecurities borrowed under the scheme were used, before America entered the VIar.. to provide collateral for loans in the American markets.     Two market loans so secured . matured during the War, and the American Treasury lent Britain the sums to repay, on condition that the rights of the original lenders over the collateral should be &quot;surrogated&quot; (i*eB transferred) to the American Treasury.     They were asrare that the British Treasury were not full owners of the securities so subrcgatedoPast negotiations leave little doubt that the Americam Treasury will release these securities as part of the arrangements for funding British debt to America0     But it appears- certain that they will not make the release without the funding of British debt, nor are they inclined to consider favourably a suggestion for the substitution of suiih securities as the British Treasury owns (e,g. Dominion and Allied Bonds) for the deposited market securities.The. delay of Lord Chalmer!s mission to   America to deal with the funding of the British debt therefore raises a serious question.     If the surrogated securities are not freed in time for return by 31st March, 1922, the National debt Office Estimate that the terms of the Deposit Scheme will involve payment to the owners of  17,500,000- above the present market value of the securities.     In addition depositors receive      per annum additional interest while their securities
-     18mmare held by the Treasury, so that delay in returning the subrogated securities (the.face value erf rdi:Uh. is $65,,297,200 and  67,607,395) costs approximately  1,000 a day on this score alone, as sell ps the cost of staff etccThe release of the surrogated- cecurities. at an early date is therefore most desirable, in oreer to curtail current expenses and to avoid a forced purchase, which, besides involving a possible loss of  17.,500;000, would no doubt cause considerable discontent and damage to creditqIt is submitted therefore that it is desirable that Lord Chalmers1 departure for America should be hastened as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made with new American administratively ion a(Intlld,)   AoC0Treasury,S11th March, 1921*
