PART L-THE LABOUR SITUATION.THE GENERAL SITUATION.General Survey of the Week.Negotiations in the coal mining industry have made little progress towards a settle-ment, though, with the acceptance of decontrol by the Mining Association at a meeting on the 3rd March, and the passing of the second reading of the Coal Mines (Decontrol) Bill in the House of Commons on the 8th March, the controversy again seems likely to revert to the alternatives of wages reductions, a curtailment of profits, or a State subsidy, with the 31st March as the time limit for reaching a decision. The railway and building industries are in slightly more favourable positions, in that the sfiding-scale method of payment is already in operation in the former, while the employees of the latter are at present taking a ballot on a recommendation by their executives favourable to the intro-duction of such a system. Further, the railways are not faced with decontrol until the 31st August.The federations representing employers and employees in the engineering trades are meeting at York, on the 10th March, to discuss &quot; costs of production in relation to state of trade, and cost of living,&quot; though the present wage levels are stabilised by agreement until June next. Employers and workpeople engaged in shipbuilding are also meeting at Newcastle on the same date to consider what is virtually a similar problem in their industry. The National Maritime Board are arranging to discuss the employers&apos; proposals for wages reductions of all ratings next week. In certain other cases, such as the vehicle building industry, the London commercial road transport industry, and the Scottish electrical contracting industry, proposals for wages reductions have reached a more advanced stage, and appear likely to entail serious conflicts. Meanwhile the national strike of shipyard joiners against the 12s. reduction continues.It will thus be clear that a movement for readjustment is taking shape throughout a very wide range of industries, and it is difficult to forecast what may be its outcome. It appears that proposals are being made that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress should call a special conference next month, in order to co-ordinate the action of the whole Labour movement to meet the &quot; united attack on wages &quot; ; rumours are also current that endeavours are being made to promote combined action by the Triple Alliance in this matter. It is conceivable that some form of agreement for a reduction of wages and corresponding limitation of profits may be reached in one industry, which will set a precedent for a peaceful settlement in all others. On the other hand, there is also the possibility that a case of direct action by one group of employers, or of work-people, may be the cause of extended sympathetic action throughout the country and precipitate a very.serious crisis.The Unemployment Position.Statistics-Tke number of H.M. Forces and merchant seamen out-of-work donation policies lodged in the United Kingdom on the 25th February was 361,002, of which 337?&apos;635
tFEATURES OF THE WEEK.Unemployment.Relief of Unemployment. No decision has yet been reached concerning the proposals for the absorption of 50,000 unemployed ex-Service men in the building industry. A private conference of the executive councils of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives was held on the 3rd and 4th March. Some differences of opinion appeared to exist among the delegates on the general principles of dilution. It is reported that some delegates declared dilution to be totally unnecessary, while others urged that, if it were accepted, there should be adequate safeguards for the protection of the industry. The bricklayers are said to be willing to consider favourably a scheme for increasing the supply of skilled workers by the upgrading of labourers already in the industry, but it is not thought probable that any such proposal will be brought forward unless the Government decide to withdraw their proposals. The Federation have not yet been made acquainted with the Government^ proposals to the employers, which were recently submitted by the executive of the employers&apos; federation to their members, with a recommendation that they should be accepted. A ballot vote of the employers is being taken on the question of acceptance.Miners.-The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, at a meeting on the 2nd March, completed, for sending out to the districts, a scheme for the raising of a special national fund for providing supplementary relief to miners at present unem-ployed. This scheme appears to follow the principles outlined in this Report last week. South Wales is the district at present suffering most acutely from, unemployment, but it is anticipated that Northumberland, Durham and Scotland may soon be seriously affected.It appears, however, that a draft scheme was already being considered by the districts of/ the Miners&apos; Federation during the week-end prior to the meeting of the executive. From the reports which have been received of these district meetings, it is judged that the scheme provides for a levy of Qd. per full member, and 3d. per half member, per shift worked, to be collected from miners in employment. An endeavour will be made to arrange for the deduction of this levy at the colliery pay offices week by week from the miners&apos; wages. The proposed benefit is  1 per week for each full member, plus 2s. for each dependent child under 16 not in employment. The benefit for each half-member will be 10s. per week. Proportionate sums will be given for odd shifts lost, but a member is not entitled to benefit who works three days or more in any week. The districts will be responsible for the collection of the levy and the distribution of the benefit, but any favourable balance week by week will be sent to the central office of the Federation in London, so as to form a national pool from which may be made up any adverse balances in other districts. The replies of the districts on the scheme are to be returned by the 19th March, and, if they are(b 17079T) 2 12General Situation-continued.were lodged by men and 483 by women totally unemployed, and 22,690 by men and 194 by women working short time. On the 18th February there were 365,181 policies lodged, of which 343,087 were lodged by men and 438 by women totally unemployed, and 21,478 by men and 178 by women working short time.On the 25th February in the United Kingdom 1,535,429 unemployment books remained lodged under the Unemployment Insurance Act, of which 474,551 were lodged by males and 340,149 by females totally unemployed, and 297,811 by males and 422,918 by females working short time; an increase on the previous week of 39,417 totally unemployed and 12,047 working short time.The total on the live register of all Employment Exchanges in the United Kingdom on the 4th March was 1,254,100. The above are advance figures provided by the Employ -ment Department, and are subject to revision.A full analysis of the unemployment position will be found on page 258.
* H.C. 37 of 1921.favourable, it is proposed to put the scheme into operation on and from the 21st March, or, at the latest, at the beginning of April.Cotton Textile Industry, The depression in the cotton industry still continues. At a meeting of the General Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associa-tions, held in Manchester on the 4th March, it was decided that the existing scheme of curtailing production should be continued for the present. The American section is, there-fore, to continue to work three days a week, and the Egyptian section four days a week. A proposal was put forward that there should be a stoppage of ten days at Easter, but was not adopted.Co-operative Wholesale Society. At a meeting of the Board of Directors on the 5th March, it was decided that the various distributive departments of the Society should adopt a system of short-time working. This decision will effect the drapery and clothing depart-ments in London, Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff, and Newcastle, and will involve several thousands of workpeople, who, under the new arrangement, will work two weeks out of every three. The foodstuffs distributive departments are not concerned in the reduction at present, nor are the managers and travelling staffs.Control of Industry.Coal Mining Industry. In accordance with the communications of the President of the Board of Trade to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the Mining Association of Great Britain on the 23rd February, the Secretary for Mines introduced into the House of Commons on the 4th March a &quot; Coal Mines (Decontrol) Bill.&quot; The main purpose of the Bill is to provide that the Coal Mines Emergency Act, 1920, as amended by any subsequent enactment, shall, so far as it is limited in duration, continue in force until the 31st March and no longer, and to repeal as from the 1st April, Section 3 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, which provides for the Coal Mines Emergency Act, 1920, continuing in force until the 31st August, 1921. The second reading of this Bill was taken in the House of Commons on the 8th March.The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation met those members of the Parliamentary Labour Party who are connected with the Federation, on the 8th March, to discuss the Bill, and the Parliamentary Labour Party in the House of Commons opposed the second reading.A meeting of the sub-committee of the Triple Alliance, which consists of the presidents and secretaries of the three constituent organisations, took place on the same day, to con-sider the advisability of calling a full conference of the Alliance to discuss the position. The Sub-committee decided not to convene such a conference at the present time.General Topics.Industrial Courts Act, 1919 : Tramwaymen&apos;s Court of Inquiry. The Court of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Labour under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, to investigate the wages dispute in the tramway industry, adopted, a unanimous report on the 24th February, which has now been published.* The employees&apos; side of the Joint Industrial Council claimed a general advance upon the current rates of 12s. a week to all tramway employees aged 18 years and over, and 6s. a week to all youths under 18 years of age, pending the completion of the work of any standardisation committee that might be appointed. The employers&apos; representatives raised the issue of inability to pay without crippling the industry.The findings of the Court on the wages claim are as follows : &quot; We are of opinion that a broad view should be taken of the wages position in this industry. The wages increases have not advanced at the same rate as the cost of living figure since July, 1914, and the application put forward in October, 1920, was intended to compensate for the rise in the cost of living that had taken place since the last wages settlement in March, 1920, and to meet the further increase that was immediately anticipated. Subsequently to October the cost of living figure rose considerably, and it has since fallen. We are not in a position to predict its future movements. Having carefully considered the statements and evidence so fully and exhaustively brought before us, we submit that, in view of the unsatisfactory condition of the industry, and under all the existing circumstances, the position and the claim would be met by the following recommendations :--(1) That the Industrial Council should examine the position of those undertakings which have not observed previous agreements and arbitration awards in regard to wages advances, and the undertakings should be advised that if possible, the advances should be paid in full.
(2) That the present wages standard should be maintained both as regards municipalities and companies until 31st December, 1921. (3) That the Industrial Council should consider the question of standardisation in the nearfuture dealing with the various grades of employees in relation to each other, havingregard to the earning capacity of the undertakings, and to the interests of the travellingpublic.(4) That the Council should examine the circumstances of the lower paid grades with a view to adjusting their conditions on a more satisfactory basis,In connection with the inquiry, the report states that much evidence was given as to the financial relations between the municipalities and their tramways. &quot; The balance .of opinion is much in favour of the passenger paying for his ride and of running the services without subsidy and without handing over surplus profits to the relief of rates; indeed the two sides of the Industrial Council have agreed that the rider should pay the cost of the ride in the fare charged.&quot; With regard to the companies, moreover, it is recognised that a point may be reached when the passenger is paying as high a fare as can reasonably be charged for the services supplied, and any further increase would defeat its own end.Trade Boards Acts  With reference to the demand of the Flax and Jute Spinners and Manufacturers&apos; Association for the suspension of the operations of the Trade Boards Acts,* a deputation representing the jute and flax workers of Scotland and England visited the Minister of Labour on the 2nd March, and urged that the operations of the Boards should continue. The opinion was put forward that the depression in the industry was due to world conditions, and not to any action on the part of either the employers or employees.fTrade Union Topics.Amalgamation of Municipal Workers&apos; Unions. At a recent conference held under the auspices of the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union, the proposed amalgamation of unions catering for municipal wdrkers.and other general and clerical workers was discussed. The unions represented were the Workers&apos; Union, the Municipal Employees&apos; Association, the National Asylum Workers&apos; Union, the Poor Law Workers&apos; Trade Union, the National Union of Clerks, the National Union of Waterworks Employees, the London County Council Staff Assistants, the National Association of Local Government Officers, and the Pro-fessional Union of Trained Nurses. Proposals submitted by the National Amalgamated Union as to the principles on which the amalgamation should proceed are now being con-sidered by the unions concerned. The National Asylum Workers&apos; Union and the Poor Law Workers&apos; Trade Union have already agreed to accept the proposals and to continue the negotiations. It is suggested that these two unions, together with the nurses&apos; union, shall form a Health Services Section within the amalgamation, each union to retain its separate identity, and to have the fullest measure of internal autonomy under the control of its own executive council. No strike is to be declared without the sanction of the central executive council of the amalgamation. The respective unions may continue to publish their own official journals, and existing members of the unions will be guaranteed the benefits payable under present regulations. New members will be entitled to the rates and benefits of the National Amalgamated Workers&apos; Union.National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. The negotiations in connection with the proposed amalgamation scheme for the transport and general workers&apos; unions,! appears to be proceeding very favourably. There are now 20 unions in the scheme, and the unions which have already voted on the question, and have obtained the necessary majorities in favour of amalgamation, represent approximately 400,000 members. It is reported, however, that the members of the United Eoad Transport Workers&apos; Association have not shown much inteiest in the scheme. A ballot is being taken, but so far the necessary 50 per cent, of members have not voted, and the association have decided to leave the ballot open for an indefinite period. The returns so far received show a majority against amal-gamation, and it is possible that the association will not proceed further in the matter.Organisation of Piecers in the Cotton Spinning Industry. Further developments have taken place with regard to the attempt of the Workers&apos; Union to organise the piecers in this industry.^  The Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners and Twiners* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 7, 12th February, p. 153. f See also p. 257, below.t See this Report, Vol. II, No. 24, 11th December, p.

NEGOTIATIONS AND DISPUTES.Demands and Negotiations.Building Trades Operatives (National). The executives of the unions affiliated to the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives met in London on the 2nd. March. The following statement on their proceedings was issued :-&quot; The report of the Wages and Conditions Council set up for the industry has been submitted to the full joint executives of the building trades unions, and they have decided to recommend accept-ance of the same by the constitutent bodies and members. The principle of the scheme is that on the reduction in the cost of living by a clear 6.5 points in any period of six months, a reduction in wages of a halfpenny an hour comes into operation. A fall of 13 points in the cost of living would mean a decrease in wages of a penny an hour. The halfpenny decrease automatically works from a basis of 170 points above the pre-war cost of living.&quot;The proposal will be submitted to the rank and file of the constituent unions of the Federation for their opinion by the 4th April. If ratification takes place, the National Wages and Conditions Council will proceed to deal with, all outstanding notices for altera-tions and conditions now pending, and any decision they may give cannot take effect until the 1st August.Commercial Road Transport Workers (London). A joint conference was held on the 4th March between representatives of the National Union of Vehicle Workers and the United Vehicle Workers on the one hand, and the employers&apos; associations in the London area, chief among which are the London Cartage and Haulage Contractors&apos; Association, on the other hand, to consider the question of a reduction in the wages of commercial road transport workers. The employers claimed that, on the ground of falling prices, the advance of 4s. a week conceded last December15 as war-wage should be taken o$, a reduction being proposed of 2s. from the 12th March, and of a further 2s. from the 1st April. In addition, the employers wished to introduce a cost-of-living sliding scale under which wages would fall Is. for every 5 points reduction in the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number, with an ultimate minimum of 36s. per week. The negotiations broke down. A mass meeting of the workers concerned was held on the ,6th March, at which resistance was pledged to any attempt on the part of the employers to enforce the reduction. A joint committee of the two unions has been set up to deal with the situation.It will be recalled that this 4s. bonus was accepted by the National Union of Vehicle Workers, without consultation with the United Vehicle Workers, who subsequently accepted it under protest, and strongly criticised the action of the former union as prejudic-ing the pressing of the wages claim.Seamen (National).-At the annual meeting of the Imperial. Merchant Service Guild, held at Liverpool on the 25th February, an intimation was received from the National Maritime Board to the effect that the Shipping Federation, Ltd., had requested an early meeting to consider immediate reductions of  4 10s. per month in the pay of navigating and engineering officers and other members of the deck and engineering room departments, and  5 10s. a month in the catering department, together with a proportionate reduction for crews on weekly vessels, and an entire revision of conditions of overtime for all ratings.On the 4th March, the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council considered these proposals. The conference adjourned to a date later in the month without making any official statement on the policy to be pursued.It was reported on the 8th March, that a full meeting of the Maritime Board has been convened for next week to deal with the position.__* See this Report, Vol. II, No. 24, Uth December, p. 658.   .have considered the question of giving the piecers some share in the Association&apos;s counsels and of amending the system of voting, but have decided that no alteration in conditions of membership of the piecers can be made. The Association have protested against the action of the Workers&apos; Union, and have stated that they will never &quot; allow their position to be undermined in such a manner as they (the Workers&apos; Union) propose.&quot; It is reported that the matter has been submitted to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, but the Workers&apos; Union are continuing their efforts to organise the piecers.
* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 8, 19th February, p. 182. t See this Report, Vol, III, No. 8,19th February, p. 177,Fishermen (Various Areas). Proposals for reduction in rates have been very general of late in the fishing centres in England and Wales ; but the negotiations have developed sporadically in the different localities concerned. As has already been reported, Grimsby fishermen returned to work on the 10th February.* On the 20th February, modified reductions were reported to have been accepted by the fishermen who had struck at Ramsgate. In January and February last, the trawler owners at Milford Haven threatened to lay up their boats in consequence of the alleged increased cost of running. Alternatively suggestions were made for a decrease in the trawler men&apos;s wage scale. Subsequently, a Joint Conciliation Board was set up and is now functioning. Despite its existence, however, negotiations have proved abortive, and the owners have threatened that unless a 30 per cent, reduction in wages be accepted by the various sections, the whole of the fleet will be laid up as from the 9th March.Proposals have been made by the trawler owners of Boston to reduce the wages of the fishermen by the elimination of &quot; risk &quot; and &quot; good conduct &quot; money, and the fixing of rates of  2 10s. per week, plus 5s. per 100 lbs. catch for weekly hands. The new proposals are stated by the unions to represent a reduction of 45 per cent, on present earnings. Notices of reductions in rates are also reported at Hartlepool.Postal Workers (Manchester). On the evening of the 25th February, a half-hour stay-in strike occurred in the sorting office of the Newton Street Post Office, Manchester, in consequence of the alleged making of new arrangements for the working of night duties by the department, without prior consultation with the Union of Post Office Workers in accordance with the terms of an agreement of July, 1920. In consequence of this action the three officers of the Union of Post Office Workers who conducted the meeting held during the stoppage have been suspended. On the 28th February a deputation waited upon the Postmaster, who, however, refused to discuss the agreement, and also refused to recognise the officers of the union, whom he had suspended. The matter has now been remitted to the executive council of the Union of Post Office Workers.Strikes and Lock-Outs.Electricians (Scotland). At the end of November the Electrical Trades Union gave the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland notice of a claim for what amounted to an increase of a further Qd. per hour in wages, to take effect as from the 28th February, which would have made the rate 2s. 9d. per hour for a 47-hour week. At the same time the employers&apos; association gave notice of a reduction of 3d. per hour in wages. A conference between the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland and representatives of the Electrical Trades Union, which was held on the 4th March in Edinburgh, proved abortive. Accordingly the reduction becomes operative for the first full week in March. An aggregate meeting of the members of the Electrical Trades Union in the Glasgow district took place on the 6th, when it was decided that all members in the employment of members of the Electrical Contractors&apos; Association of Scotland should cease work. Similar action has been taken by the union branches in Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Perth.Nut and Bolt Trades Operatives (Midlands). The strike in the Midland nut and bolt trade which began as an unofficial strike has now been sanctioned by the National Union of General Workers and the Workers&apos; Union, whose officials have extended the area of the movement. About 4,000 workers are now affected in Birmingham, Smethwick, West Bromwich, Daiiaston, and other towns in the Black Country.On the 2nd March, the largest firm in the trade, Messrs. Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Ltd., on receiving an intimation that a section of their workpeople intended to join the movement, immediately closed down their works at Smethwick. This is the employers&apos; policy, while the decision of the trade unions not to resume negotiations unless the employers agree to a resumption of work on the old terms adds to the complication, fVehicle Builders (National). In connection with the proposed reduction of wages in the vehicle building industry, f conferences were held at Leeds on the 2nd and 15th February between the National Employers&apos; Association of Vehicle Builders, including the Welsh section of that organisation, and the Scottish Vehicle Builders&apos; Association on the one hand, and the National Union of Vehicle Builders, the Amalgamated Society of Wheelwrights, Smiths and Kindred Trades, and the Amalgamated Society of Woodcutting Machinists, on the other.  The employers proposed a definite reduction of Zd. an hour in wages.
The unions refused to agree to this, and proposed that present rates should be maintained for three months after, which they would consider a sliding scale based on the Labour Gazette cost-of-living index number. The employers declined to agree to this plan, and have refused a further conference unless the unions are prepared to accept the principle of reduction at once, or the immediate operation of a sliding scale. Following the break-down in the negotiations, the National Employers&apos; Association have now issued lock-out notices, to take effect on the 12th March.In the meantime it is report ed that the reduction has been accepted at Wolverhampton, Bristol and Worcester. The notices of the Scottish Vehicle Builders Association came into effect on the 7th March. Members of the Glasgow and district branch of the National Union of Vehicle Builders decided, on the 6th March, to cease work, and it is understood that other centres will probably be involved.The National Federation of Vehicle Trades preferred to conduct 5 independent negotia-tions, and a separate meeting was arranged in Leeds on the 16th February. In this case, the employers&apos; representatives offered to submit the union&apos;s proposal to their respective organisations, but held out little hope of its acceptance. The existing agreement does not expire until the 22nd March. Suggestions for a national conference with the Unions on the 16th March are now being put forward.Co-operative Employees (Grimsby, Stockton and Manchester).-As a protest against the action of the Management Committee in giving notice to certain employees to end their weekly employment and offering reinstatement on a basis of five days a week, the employees of the Grimsby Co-operative Society came out on strike on the 5th March. The committee state that this step is necessary in order to keep expenses proportionate with turnover, and that the offer of five days a week has been made in order to avoid unemployment. The operatives, however, object to the introduction by the society of short time without prior consultation with them, and are insisting that the letter from the society containing the short-time proposal be withdrawn before negotiations take place.About 400 employees of the Stockton Co-operative Society ceased work on the 5th March in protest against a number of dismissals. The strikers claim that there is an agreement between the union and the society whereby short time shall be worked in place of discharges.In connection with the adoption of a short-time policy, the employees of the Manchester Co-operative Laundries, Ltd., at Newton Heath and Seed^, threatened to withdraw their labour on the 9th February because of the alleged breaking of an agreement by the substitution of work on an hourly basis for the guaranteed week. After discussion the management agreed not to introduce short time at present, but to discharge staff in the event of slackness of trade. They are still negotiating, however, with a view to the adoption of short time at a later date.Settlements and Agreements.Coal Miners (National). The executive of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain met on the 2nd March to receive a report of the proceedings at the meeting on the 25th February between their negotiating committee and representatives of the Mining Associa-tion of Great Britain. It was decided to summon a special meeting of the national delegate conference of the Federation for the 10th March, and, in preparation for this meeting, the executive will meet on the 9th March.This decision is the most important decision arrived at in the course of the week with regard to the position in the coal mining industry. An important statement, however, was made by Mr. Evan Williams, president of the Mining Association, at a meeting of the Association on the 2nd March. Mr. Williams gave a clear summary of the coalowners&apos; position, and indicated that an agreement had been reached between the owners and miners on four main principles, which he outlined as follows : 1. Wages must conform to the capacity of the industry to pay them.2. The receipt of a standard wage should justify a corresponding minimum profit to the colliery undertakings.3. Any surplus remaining after these and the usual working costs had   been met should be be divided between the men and the owners in agreed proportions, the workpeople&apos;s share to be an addition to their standard wages.4. Joint audits of the owners&apos; books by accountants representing each side should be made, to ascertain all the data necessary for the periodical determination of wages,
* See also under Control of Industry, p. 246, above.f See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 9, 26th February, p. 200.f- This union have also secured the renewal of this agreement with the Wholesale Drug and Fine Chemicals Association, until the 20th June.Mr. Williams also expressed the opinion that had it not been for the decision of the Government to terminate control of the industry by the 31st March, the owners and miners might well have succeeded in compiling a detailed agreement for the future regulation of wages in the industry. In view, however, of the Governments decision with regard to de-control, the owners must insist that they could not agree to the miners&apos; proposals for the continuance of national wages agreements, together with a national pool. &quot; Where there are such great divergencies between the districts as at present, each district must determine its own wages by its ability to pay, and the individual who cannot pay the wages so determined must decide for himself whether to close his pits or bear the loss.&quot;This statement was followed on the next day by a reply on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation issued by Mr. Frank Hodges. Mr. Hodges declared that the difference between the miners and owners was fundamental in character, and one that could only be reconciled by Governmental action through the Board of Trade and the Coal Mines Department. &quot; First and foremost the Government should abandon its proposal to financially de-control the trade on the 31st March, for it is this very proposal that has precipitated the deadlock between the parties.&quot; It is anticipated that the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federa-tion, at their meeting on the 10th March, may decide that the scheme of the Federation for the future regulation of wages in the industry be submitted to the Government inde-pendently of the owners. The terms of the first part of the agreement which terminated the coal strike in November last year would then be fulfilled by independent reports to the Government from the Miners&apos; Federation and the Mining Association, each putting forward their own scheme and acknowledging the impracticability of presenting an agreed scheme. On the other hand, it is reported in one quarter that the delegate conference may agree to negotiations being opened with the owners, in order to arrive at an agreement with regard to the immediate difficulties engendered by the de-control of the industry on the 31st March.*Engineering: Youths and Boys (Midlands).-lt was previously reported that a con-ference which was held on the 14th February between the Birmingham and Wolverhampton District Association of the Engineering and the National Employers&apos; Federations and the 15 unions, affected by the proposed reduction of wages for youths and boys was adjourned until the 28th February. The conference met, however, on the 25th, when the employers made an offer of a slight advance on rates originally proposed by them. The offer was refused by the unions, but a joint committee was set up with a view to effecting a local settlement, f It is now reported that this committee have agreed upon a new schedule of rates, no details of which, however, are yet available.Textile Warehousemen (National). Negotiations between the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers and the Wholesale Textile Association have resulted in the renewal of the wages agreement which expired on the 1st February until the 1st August next. The National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and ClerksJ have also made a similar agreement with the Wholesale Textile Association to retain the existing wage scale until the 1st August.Actors (National). A special general meeting of the Actors&apos; Association was held at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, on the 2nd March. A resolution was passed approving the council&apos;s policy to boycott managers who refused to pay the minimum wages and to observe the conditions of the standard contract, and deciding that on and after the 21st March every manager concerned in such acts should be boycotted by the Association. The resolution also provided that members signing a contract lower than the standard contract should render themselves liable to expulsion from the Association, but that any actor who suffers by carrying out the resolution should be entitled to protection. It was decided to levy Qd. a week from the members, for six months as from the 14th March, to raise a protection fund. The new standard contract comes into force on the 21st March, and has been approved both by the Actors&apos; Association and by the Association of Touring Managers.[Other disputes, negotiations and settlements are referred to in the Industrial Relations Departmental Section of the Report, pages 252 to 256.]
PART IL-THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY.INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DEPARTMENT.ENGINEERING, SHIPBUILDING AND ALLIED TRADES.Railway Shopmen- Following on a communication from the Negotiating Committee of General Managers that the national negotiations regarding rates and conditions of the various grades of railway shopmen had broken down owing to the dispute between the craft unions and the National Union of Railwayman, Sir David Shackleton, on the 4th March, met separately representatives of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades and the Amalgamated Engineering Union, on the one hand, and, on the other, representatives of the National Union of Railwaymen, and discussed the proposal of the Negotiating Committee of General Managers that the claims should be referred to arbitra-tion. The representatives of the federation and of the Amalgamated Engineering Union intimated their willingness to agree to arbitration, subject to certain definite terms of reference, and to a separate hearing, before the Industrial Court, for the National Union of Railwaymen.The industrial secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen stated that his union were opposed, on principle, to arbitration except in the case of war bonuses, but he agreed to put the proposal before his executive at an early date, and to inform the Ministry of the result.Electrical Contracting. The Industrial Council met at York on the 25th February. An agreement on the question of overtime, night-shifts, country work and foreign allow-ances, signed the previous day by representatives of the Electrical Trades Union and of the National Federated Electrical Association, was ratified by the Council. A sub-committee was appointed to deal with the question of apprenticeship rates of wages, and to report to the next meeting of the Council. It was resolved to decline to have anything to do with the proposed Association of Joint Industrial Councils until the cpiestion of conferring statutory powers on these bodies had been constitutionally dealt with. A sub-committee was appointed to draw up a scheme for the delimitation of areas of District Councils. Representatives were elected to a committee formed to advise the City and Guilds of London Institute on the question of a syllabus for technical examinations in the electrical contracting industry. The dispute in Belfast on the question of grading had been referred by the bodies concerned to the arbitration of the National Council. The Council decided that Belfast should be placed in Grade C for six months, after which it should be graded B. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s letter on the question of working short time was considered, and it was decided that the proposal was impracticable for the industry, and that, in any case, unemployment was not abnormal except in shipbuilding and repairing centres.Shipbuilding: Wages Negotiations. The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades have been informed that the claim for a general advance in wages, in connection with which the Federation requested the setting up of a Court of Inquiry, * is one which can properly be dealt with under the alternatives indicated in Part I of the Industrial Courts Acts, including reference to arbitration, and that, in the circumstances, a Court of Inquiry is not called for.BUILDING AND WORKS OF CONSTRUCTION.Building. At the last meeting of the Managements and Costs Committee of the Joint Industrial Council on the 24th and 25th February, the committee rescinded their resolution of the 16th December, which proposed a benefit of 30s. per man per week, and joint equal contributions, under a supplementary scheme of unemployment insurance. They resolved, in view of the amending Bill to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, to await further information regarding the contributions needed approximately to double the benefits under the Acts.  The Employment Department have been asked to furnish figures* See this Report, Vol. Ill, No. 9, 26th February, p. 203.
showing the cost of doubling existing benefits, and, alternatively, to show what benefits could be provided by additional contributions from employers and operatives of Id. to M. The committee are of opiiron that ultimately the cost of a supplementary scheme might be materially diminished by measures designed to regularise the demand for building trade labour. The committee have also requested the secretary of the National Federation of Building Trades Employers to put before his members a proposal that representative employers should volunteer to keep a record of time lost by the different crafts owing to stress of weather, and report to the committee weekly.Heating and Domestic Engineering. The plumbers&apos; union have circulated throughout the country copies of the findings of the sub-committee of the Trades Union Congress on the dispute at Blackley. They claim that the findings dispose of similar demarcation disputes in progress in other districts.The executive council of the heating engineers&apos; union have pointed out to the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress that the union did not consent to accept the sub-committee as an arbitration tribunal, and only attended on the express condition that the sub-committee was holding a conciliation conference. The executive council have accordingly repudiated the findings, as a decision of the question either at Blackley or in any other part of the country, and the National Association of Master Heating Engineers are in agreement with the union on this subject.Strike of Painters (Wisbech). After some difficulty, a joint conference of the master painters and representatives of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, was eventually held on the 20th February, under the chairmanship of an officer of the department. The employers&apos; case for the proposed reduction in wages was that customers were declining to have work done at the present costs, which are considered exorbitant. The painters&apos; rate in 1914 was bhd. per hour ; it was now Is. 11c?. A standard job which, in 1914, took about 10 hours to complete, was now taking from 15 to 20 hours owing to slackness on the part of the operatives. The reduction in the cost-of-living index number was also advanced. The representatives of the operatives argued that, although some reduction in wage appeared to be almost inevitable, it should be introduced in a con-stitutional manner. The present rates should be continued pending a settlement of the general question of rates, which was under consideration by the national wages and conditions council for the building trade. The chairman of the master painters&apos; association eventually undertook to recommend that no reduction should be enforced pending the decision of the council.FOOD AND DRINK.Scottish Bakers. The Industrial Council have now suggested to the union that the national agreement, due to expire on the 28th February, shall remain in force until the 2nd April.The Glasgow employers have intimated that, as the local agreement has expired, and has not been superseded, they are no longer obliged to pay the last advance of 76&apos;. Qd. per week. The operatives have regarded this as a threat, and a mass meeting was convened for the 6th March.Fishermen&apos;s Wages (Milford Haven).-T!h.e Conciliation Board for the Milford Haven Docks has now been set up. The constitution provides that, if necessary, the Board may elect as their chairman an independent person from outside their body, and, failing election by the unanimous vote of the members of the Board, the Ministry of Labour shall be asked to nominate a chairman; such nomination shall, however, be subject to con-firmation by the majority of the Board. The Board are already at work, but have not yet been able to settle the difference in the fishing industry. The employers have renewed their threat to lay up the&quot; boats, and a further joint conference was arranged for the 4th March.POTTERY AND RUBBER.Pottery.-rJih.e Executive, General Purposes and Finance Committee of the Industrial Council met on the 24th February. A reply was read from the Chancellor of the Exchequer stating that he could not agree to the request that expenditure on welfare schemes should be.subject to rebate of income tax. It was resolved to approach local members of Parliament with a request for their support.Potteries (Scotland).-rWe Potters&apos; Federation, Ltd., on the 2nd March, decided to agree to refer the whole question of a reduction of wages to arbitration, and to amend the
rules of the Scottish Stoneware Conciliation Board so that the Board may be able to consider, in future, questions applicable either to the whole trade or to specific sections of the trade.Joint terms of reference have been received, but, as the employers are not prepared to pay the old rates pending the issue of the award, the strike continues. It has been decided not to refer the case for arbitration until another effort has been made to secure a resumption of work.Linoleum Manufacture. A deputation from the National Federation of General Workers were interviewed at headquarters in December last. They requested the estab-lishment of some form of joint industrial organisation for the linoleum manufacturing trade, and wished to meet representatives of the employers, or of their organisation, to discuss the matter. Before convening a conference of employers, it was considered desir-able that the various firms should be approached by the Chief Conciliation Officer with a view to winning them over to the idea of a Council for the industry. From the reports of these interviews, it appeared that none of the employers were anxious to have either a Council or a Trade Board, and the majority were opposed to the setting up of any organisa-tion. Representatives of the National Federation of General Workers were again inter-viewed by Mr. H. J. Wilson, on the 8th February, when it was explained that if the three largest firms, namely, Lord Ashton&apos;s and two Kirkcaldy firms, remained outside, only a small proportion of the trade would be represented, and that in these circumstances the conditions for setting up a Whitley Council were non-existent. It was pointed out that the establishment of a Trade Board was a question which would have to be decided by the Minister upon the merits of the case. The deputation were of opinion that the two Kirkcaldy firms might be induced to agree to form a Council if their directors could be seen by a headquarters representative of the department. Mr. Wilson arranged to discuss the matter personally with directors of the two firms referred to. These gentlemen promised to raise the matter with their co-directors, and with other representatives of their trade, and to inform the department of their considered opinion.CHEMICALS AND EXPLOSIVES.Soap and Candles. At a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council on the 3rd March, the position created by the employers&apos; decision to withdraw from the Council was con-sidered further. The two joint chairmen, having met since the last meeting, brought forward a proposal that the Council should meet normally once a year, and their business be conducted by an executive committee of six a side, who should have power to call the Council together whenever necessary. The workers&apos; side accepted this proposal. As the employers&apos; decision to withdraw had been reached at a meeting of the trade, the employers&apos; representatives could not accept the proposal without further consideration. A meeting is to be held on the 23rd March, when, in addition to this question, a notification of reduction of wages by the employers will also be considered.TEXTILES.Reduction in Wages : Cotton Trade. Representatives of Messrs. R. Williams &amp; Sons, Gorton, and their employees interviewed the Chief Conciliation Officer, Manchester, on the 1st March, on the subject of the recent voluntary reduction in wages. They stated that the object of stimulating trade, which they had in view in effecting reductions in wages and dyeing charges, was not being realised as readily as they anticipated ; and they thought that other manufacturers and workpeople should follow the lead given. They accordingly asked whether the Ministry would be prepared to use the precedent which they had estab-lished to influence employers and workpeople in other industries.The Chief Conciliation Officer has been instructed to inform the firm that the Ministry are not competent to express an opinion on the course adopted, even if they were not pre-cluded from so doing by the fact that their general function in wages disputes is to act as an impartial intermediary.&quot; It is understood that the firm are not a member of any associa-tion of employers. Most of the operatives are now believed to be members of one or other of the trade unions.MINING.Non-Ferrous Mining. The Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committee met on the 2nd March. Owing to the depressed state of the industry, it was agreed that the regular meetings of the committee were not required at present, and it was decided to suspend the clause of the constitution providing for quarterly meetings.  The annual meeting will be
held in June, but no further meetings will be called unlesss the chairman, vice-chairman and secretary agree to summon one on the ground of urgent business.A wages reduction of Is. per shift, which had been put in force at one of the two mines now working, was discussed. The trade union side urged that all wages matters should be brought before the committee, but, in the absence of a declared policy of the functions of the committee as regards wages, it was decided that, until the committee lay down a general ruling, wages negotiations should be carried out locally. A full discussion on the future method of regulating wages in the industry will take place at the annual meeting.Lead Mining. The result of the ballot at Wanlockhead was against acceptance, and the voting at this mine and at Leadhills shows a majority of 31 against. The Miners&apos; Federation have decided that the dispute must still continue. Both companies have now refused to agree to the suggestion of the federation that they should submit their books to an independent auditor. Officials of both companies have stated to representatives of the department that, even if the men were prepared to accept the reduction of 25 per cent., it would be impossible to restart the mines, owing to a further fall in the price of lead.PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC UTILITY SERVICES.Electricity Supply. A conference of representatives of certain electricity supply undertakings in the Lancashire and Cheshire area, and of the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, was held at Manchester, on the 28th February, under the chairmanship of Sir David Shackleton, to consider further their difference in regard to the schedule of salaries and conditions of employment recommended by the National Joint Board. Agreement was arrived at on the basis that the existing arrangements in regard to sick leave be maintained, with an understanding that, should any disputes or cases of hardship arise with respect to any individual member of the technical start, and should a satisfactory settle-ment with the respective undertakings not be reached, the matter be referred to the District Joint Board ; the agreement to hold good pending reconsideration and settlement of the sick leave clause of the conditions of employment by the District Joint Boards and the National Joint Board. A similar conference for the North-East Coast and Yorkshire area was held, under the chairmanship of Sir David Shackleton, at Leeds, on the 1st March, and a similar agreement was reached.The District Council for the South Coast Area, comprising Sussex, Hampshire and Dorset, met on the 28th February. It was agreed to refer the consideration of a scheme for sick pay to the Basic Rates Committee; and to ask the National Council to give an interpretation of Clause 11 of the working conditions, &quot; That where existing conditions are better they shall not be prejudiced.&quot;Local Authorities&apos; Administrative, Technical and Clerical Services (England and Wales).  A further conference of representatives of the Ilford Urban District Council and the Municipal Employees&apos; Association was held at Ilford Town Hall, under the chairmanship of Sir David Shackleton, on the 3rd March, to consider the difference between the parties in regard to the clerical staffs, and the manual workers employed in the non-trading services of the Council. It was agreed that a joint staff committee be appointed, and that the matters in dispute, in regard to the clerical staffs,be referred to.this committee. No agreement was reached on the matters in dispute in regard to the manual workers, but it was arranged that representatives of the parties should confer with Sir David Shackleton at an early date.The first meeting of the District Council for the area of the Administrative County of London was held on the 28th February. A constitution was adopted, officers were appointed, and a General Purposes Committee set up. Twenty-five out of the twenty-eight Metropolitan Boroughs have appointed representatives, and the London County Council are also represented.The first meeting of the District Council for the Midland Area, comprising Stafford-shire, Shropshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Herefordshire, was held on the 2nd March.  It was reported that the County Councils had refused to nominate representatives.Local Authorities&apos; Non-Trading Services, Manual Workers (England and Wales).-The National Council met on the 4th March. It was decided that the question of the secession of local authorities from the various Provincial Councils should be one of the subjects for discussion at the proposed conference of representatives of the Provincial Councils and tile National Council.  It was further decided that conferences of the local authorities and of
GENERAL DEPARTMENT.TRADE BOARDS. PROCEEDINGS.Dressmaking and womens Light Clothing Trade Board (England and Wales). The Board considered a letter from the Minister relating to a proposal made by the Dressmaking and Women&apos;s Light Clothing Trade Board (Scotland) that a separate Trade Board be established in Scotland, to include within its scope the manufacturing section of the dress-making and women&apos;s light clothing trade, and the men&apos;s shirt trade. They agreed to reply that the establishment of such a Board would, in their opinion, lead to greater difli-culties than those which are at present experienced.  It was further agreed to informthe trade unions concerned should be held in Essex, Hertfordshire and Middlesex to con-sider the position with regard to the Provincial Council for the Northern Home Counties.MISCELLANEOUS TRADES.Shop Assistants-With. reference to the claim made by the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, that certain firms belonging to the Incorporated Association of Retail Distributors should put into operation Award No. 594 of the Industrial Court, a letter has been received from the secretary of the association in which it is stated that the firms in question are paying minimum rates of wages higher than those being paid by any organisation of employers engaged in retail distribution, and they do not intend, in view of the falling cost of living and the present condition of trade, to alter the minimum rates in operation, unless it may become necessary to do so to comply with any rates fixed by the proposed Trade Board. They contend that, if the Award were accepted, it would mean, in the main, that the employees of the firm would be less favourably situated.Co-operative Employees. A claim was made for uniform minimum rates and certain working conditions throughout the whole of the Southern Sectional Area of the Co-operative Union, Ltd. The Industrial Court observed that under the agreement dated the 13th January, 1920, the societies are classified into two groups, Group I and Group II, and that the rates payable in Group It are 1\ per cent, less than those payable in Group I. It was held that the grouping should for the present be maintained, and that, in view of the change in rates effected by this Award, the existing percentage should be raised from 7^ to 10.Minimum rates of wages were fixed for Group I employees in all departments except those whose wages are regulated by national awards or agreements. The wages vary, according to age, from 23s. to 70s. per week for male employees, and from 21s. to 51s. for female employees. For clerical workers the wages vary from 23s. to 80s. per week for male clerks, and from 21s. to 55s. per week for female clerks. Rates were also fixed for first assistants, branch managers and manageresses, head warehousemen, departmental managers and manageresses, buyers, and boot and shoe repairers.It was decided that two weeks&apos; full pay at time-rates and two weeks&apos; half-pay should be allowed during sickness in any one year after six months&apos; service, and that all employees with not less than twelve months&apos; service should be entitled to six working days&apos; holiday per year with pay. After two years&apos; service, adults should be entitled to twelve working days&apos; holiday with pay.   (Award No. 622.)Waste Paper Trade Workers (London). Following a proposal by Messrs. Lendrum, Ltd., to reduce the rates of the workpeople employed in their waste paper department, the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union called out their members, numbering approximately 25 men, on the 28th February. The Chief Conciliation Officer has arranged to meet the various unions concerned in the dispute. Meantime it has been suggested to the firm that work might be resumed, if the reductions were withdrawn pending a conference with the British Paper Stock: Merchants&apos; Association, of which Messrs. Lendrum are members, or by the reference of the difference to the Industrial Court:Cinema Operators (Bristol). The Cinematograph Exhibitors&apos; Association have now agreed to meet the Electrical Trades Union.[Reference to matters of interest in connection with Industrial Relations will be found also on pages 244 to 251 and 257.]
General Department-continued.the Minister that, in the judgment of the Board, the question of the establishment of [f separate Trade Boards for clothing trades in Scotland should be reviewed, and all the Trade Boards concerned should be consulted.The Board received a report from the Administrative Committee, relating especially to the minimum rates of wages for female learners in the retail bespoke dressmaking trade. Subject to certain amendments, the report of the Administrative Committee was adopted, and it was agreed to give Notice of Proposal to vary the minimum rates of wages for female workers in the retail bespoke dressmaking trade by providing lower rates for female learners, and by providing increased rates for certain classes of adult female workers who have had specified experience in that branch.The Board considered a letter from the Minister on the subject of proposed amendments to the scope of the Trade Boards Orders for the women&apos;s clothing, tailoring and fur trades, and, in agreement with a suggestion made by the Minister, two representatives from each side of the Board were appointed to attend a conference to discuss this question.The following resolution was unanimously adopted, and it was agreed that copies be sent to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour and the Press : &quot; That, having been informed that steps are being made to depreciate the work of Trade Boards and to have Trade Boards abolished, this Trade Board record the opinion that they approve, in principle of the establishment of Trade Boards, and, provided certain defects of administration arc removed and due advantage is taken of the experience gained, of their continuance,&quot;Fur Trade Board (Great Britain). The Board rejected a motion for an increase in certain of the general minimum time-rates fixed.After discussion of the Ministers suggestion of the introduction of a system of short time in factories and workshops during the present depression in tiadc, the Board agreed that the Minister should be informed that the conditions in this trade are such that the working of short time is not a measure which can be systematically adopted.Retail Bespoke Tailoring Trade Board (Great Britain). The Administrative Committee made certain recommendations to the Trade Board in respect of the minimum rates appro-priate to juvenile workers other than learners and apprentices. In view of the fact that the adoption of the recommendations would necessitate amendment of the Board&apos;s proposals to vary rates as agreed at the last meeting of the Board, the secretary was instructed not to issue the Notice containing the proposals in respect of learners, pending consideration by the Board.After consideration of a summary of opinions expressed by the Minister with regard to the scope of the Board, the committee agreed to forward their observations on certain opinions expressed, and to inform the Minister that the committee are unanimously and strongly of opinion that, in order to ensure the efficient administration of the Trade Boards determinations, all questions of scope, of a technical nature, should, in the first instance, be referred to the Board for their consideration and opinion.Wholesale Mantle and Costume Trade Board (Great Britain). After consideration of the objections lodged against their proposals to vary minimum rates of wages for male and female workers, the Board agreed to vary the rates as proposed by them on the 20th December, 1920.The Board unanimously resolved that, having been informed of efforts being made to depreciate the work of Trade Boards and to get them abolished, the Board expressed the opinion that the formation of a Trade Board has been of much advantage to the whole-sale mantle and costume manufacturing trade, notwithstanding certain defects of adminis-tration, towards the removal of which steps are now being taken.The Board agreed to protest against any appointment of chairmen and appointed members being made in the future without the views of the Trade Board concerned being ascertained.The Board referred to the Administrative Committee consideration of the revised definitions of the Women&apos;s Clothing Order, the Tailoring Order, and the Fur Order, and agreed to request the Minister to allow four representatives to attend the proposed con-ference to discuss these definitions.The Board considered the opinions on scope expressed by the Minister and agreed to request more precise information as to what is intended by the term &quot; workroom cleaners.&quot;The Board considered the Ministers letter received on the subject of the working of short time in the trade, and agreed to inform the Minister that the employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives had been in consultation on this matter outside the Board, and had done all that was possible to meet the situation.I [Reference to matters of interest in connection with Trade Boards will also be found on pages 254, 256, 264 and 266.]t

Reports again point to a further decline in industrial activity. This is noticeable particularly in the North-Western Division, in which the additions to the live register were considerably greater than in any week since the beginning of the year. The decline is also marked in the iron and steel and the iron ore and ironstone mining industries of the Northern and Wales Divisions.Iron and Steel. At South Bank, there are approximately 3,000 steel workers unem-ployed. In the Cleveland district, all ironstone mining is practically at a standstill; at Cleator Moor, the only iron ore mine working is on a day-to-day notice. The ironworks and iron ore mines at Millom are also at a standstill, and, as these constitute the main industries, practically all the men in this area are unemployed. At Llanelly the local steel works, employing 800 workpeople, have been closed down entirely after a period, of irregular and short-time working. At Cardiff 2,100 employees are affected by the closing of the works of Messrs. Guest, Keen &amp; Nettlefolds, Ltd.Shipbuilding and Allied Trades. The lull on the Clyde is still very pronounced, and, in view of the joiners&apos; strike, little immediate improvement, can be looked for. On the Tyne, Tees, and Wear further heavy discharges of shipyard workers have taken place, but ship-repair work has improved, particularly at Willington Quay. On the Mersey the position is regarded as more favourable. Several ship-repairing firms at Birkenhead have taken on a large number of men during the week, and the re-conditioning of the S.S. &quot; Imperator,&quot; recently purchased by the Cunard Steamship Co., Ltd., has also provided work for a considerable number of men. On the other hand, repair work at South Wales ports has fallen off considerably.Textiles and Clothing. The North-Western Division report that the position in the cotton trade grows steadily worse. Owing to the small demand for raw cotton, the price has fallen to that prevailing in 1913, and it is believed that this will necessarily re-act on the size of the cotton crop during the forthcoming year. A further improvement is reported in the boot and shoe industry. At Northampton, several firms who, since the beginning of the year have been working about two days per week are now working five days a week, and at Leicester, more firms have been able to resume full-time working. Business, how-ever, is far from being normal. A better tone is reported in some sections of the hosiery trade, but the glove and heavy half-hose sections show no immediate sign of recovery, although the price of yarn has fallen and wages are somewhat lower. A slow improvement in the lace trade continues. The orders received show that the home trade is gradually recovering. A large Admiralty contract has been obtained by the woollen factories in the Llandyssul district, which, it is expected, will keep them on full-time working up to the end of September.
Women&apos;s Employment.&apos; General Situation.-Statistics again indicate a further increase of unemployment and under-employment.Local Reports. Reports from Lancashire are exceedingly serious. The steady decline in the cotton industry continues, and the hope of brighter conditions referred to a few weeks ago seems to have entirely disappeared. Employment Exchanges in textile areas all draw attention to the fact that the number of women becoming totally unemployed is increasing. In the Egyptian section of the cotton industry at Leigh the outlook is black, and employers are pessimistic. At Bolton four mills have been added to those working short time, and the total number of women affected in this area is now 12,000. A report from Chadderton states that several mills working on the short-time system are now closing down for periods of from seven to ten days, and three mills have ceased work indefinitely. More than half the mills in the Darwen area are closed for an indefinite period. In Oldham practically every spinning mill is on short time.Unemployment in other trades is also increasing throughout the division. There is, however, some slight improvement in the sewing trades reported by various Exchanges. A large unsatisfied demand for institutional domestic workers of almost all types con-tinues. Inquiries in respect of seasonal workers are now being received from holiday resorts.In the Yorkshire and East Midlands Division depression in the woollen and textile-trades continues, and there is a large volume of short-time employment. Bradford report that unemployment is abnormal and there is no hope of improvement. Similar reports are received from other textile centres. Depression continues in the wholesale clothing, hosiery, lace, underclothing and blouse industries. These trades are severely affected at Nottingham, Derby, Basford, Ilkeston and Long Eaton.Although in the South Midlands and Eastern Division generally both unemployment and under-employment remain prevalent in the staple industries, slightly more cheerful reports are received from certain centres. At Northampton there are signs of revival in the boot trade.  There are still, however, nearly 3,000 unemployment insurance claimsMiscellaneous Trades. In the Birmingham area, employment is slack in the brass, steel tube, screw, bolt and glass trades, and employers hold out little hope of improvement in the near future. The position of the pottery trade is still good. Locomotive engineering firms in Bristol are busy, and a slight improvement in the motor trade in this district is noticeable. In the North-Western Division, general engineering is fairly active, but there are signs of decreased activity in the agricultural locomotive and motor-car branches. In the London area the position in regard to the building trade is slightly easier, but brick-layers and plasterers are still in urgent demand. The demand for painters is firmer, but there is little inquiry for electricians, plumbers and carpenters. No change is to be recorded in the engineering, furniture, leather, tin box and food products trades in this area.Agriculture and Fisheries. Exceptionally favourable weather has enabled a large amount of farm work to be carried out which is not normally possible, and employment in rural districts has consequently been fairly good. The fishing industry shows a further decline. At Fleetwood, Grimsby and Milford Haven, owners are laying up boats, as the present price of fish does not cover running expenses.Transport. On the Clyde, transport work is exceptionally quiet; it estimated that 25 cargo boats are laid up in the ports in this area. The position on the Mersey is still very unfavourable, but it is expected that the export of coal to France and other countries will soon revive, and, in shipping circles generally, the opinion is held that an improvement may be looked for in the near future. The collapse of the coal export trade is affecting transport work at all the South Wales ports. At Avonmoutli and Hull, the arrival of several grain cargoes has resulted in more dockers being employed.Labour Reductions. Bath report that 235 workpeople have been thrown out of employment by the closing down of the Golden Valley Paper Mills at Britton. At Birming-ham, the Dunlop Rubber Co., Ltd., have discharged a further 500 workpeople. At Sandbach, 260 men employed by Messrs. Fodens, Ltd., have received notices terminating their employment on the 4th March. St. Helens report that the United Alkali Co., Ltd., have definitely decided not to re-open their Kurtz Works for the manufacture of caustic soda.
current at this Exchange, and there has been a noticeable increase in claims from married women under the amended condition of application. At Leicester there is some improve-ment in the boot trade, but hosiery continues very slack.Colchester state that the wholesale clothing firms consider that trade is improving, and hope soon to put many workers now totally unemployed on short time.Serious unemployment continues to be reported in the staple industries in the West Midlands Division&apos;. Aston point out that many married women are claiming who have not been employed since 1919, generally owing to the unemployment or under-employment of their husbands. Bromsgrove state that the motor trade has improved slightly, and that a number of workers have been reinstated by the Austin Motor Co., Ltd. Coventry, however, report little change in the motor and cycle trade. The live register stands at nearly 2,000.At Leek there is a temporary improvement in the silk trade, some orders having been received for the Easter trade. At Stourbridge a few hollow-ware firms have resumed full-time work.Reports from the London and South-Eastern Division indicate little change. Where there is a decrease in the live register it is generally attributed to exhaustion of benefit. At Whitechapel, for example, the register continues at over 4,000, and, although there is some revival in the tailoring trade, there are nearly 1,400 tailoresses still on the register. At Bermondsey the register includes jam makers, tin box makers, leather stitchers, shirt and collar makers, tailoresses and factory workers. At the Borough Exchange there are nearly 3,000 on the register in similar industries.Some of the West End Exchanges also show heavy unemployment. At Shepherds Bush there are over 2,000 on the register, and at Walham Green nearly 1,400. Attention is drawn to the fact that a large number of married women are now seeking part-time employment. Great Marlborough Street Exchange report a decrease in the number of vacancies notified for dressmakers.Deptford report that there are signs of a decided revival in the tin industry, and that smaller firms are getting fresh orders now that the price of tin plates is lower, and re-employing their old workers. This Exchange also states that the clothing trade shows some improvement, although many workers are still unemployed.There is little change in the South-Western Division. There is still considerable unemployment in Bristol, but the registers are not high compared with industrial areas. At Southampton the trade depression is said to be acute, and the live register more repre-sentative of all trades than in any previous period. The glove industry is said to be at a standstill in Yeovil.Some unemployment is reported in the staple trades in Wales. In the tinplate works at Llanelly there is said to be much broken short-time work. A register of nearly 700 is reported from Cardiff, where 150 women are under suspension for refusing employment. Engineering is slack at Swansea. Messrs. Baldwins, Ltd., closed down during the week, and many women are consequently claiming insurance benefit.Employment continues slack in the Northern Division. At Carlisle, for example, over 700 women are claiming benefit, generally in the tailoring and printing trades. Paper work is slack at Sunderland, and, at Willington Quay, Messrs. E. Hood, Haggie &amp; Son, Ltd., are closing down their ropery department for 10 days, affecting 350 workers. Ropery workers are also unemployed at Dunston-on-Tyne. Kendal report that numerous applications are being received for seasonal domestic work, and that many of last season&apos;s workers are being re-engaged direct by their old employers.In Scotland depression in the staple industries continues, and there is much short time. At Edinburgh the iive register includes many rubber workers, and workers in the printing trade. Textile work continues slack in Alloa, and Galashiels report that unem-ployment is increasing in the woollen and hosiery industries. At Johnstone flax spinners, calico printers, thread makers, textile bleachers, and carpet weavers are working short time. The linen industry continues depressed in Dunfermline, and jute in Dundee. There is still serious unemployment in Glasgow. Parkhead report that 100 claims to unemploy-ment insurance made by married women and others who had not worked since 1918 have been disallowed.LOCAL EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEES.Constitution and Poivers. A sub-committee, set up by the Goole Employment Com-mittee to consider the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Employment Exchanges, have put forward various suggestions with regard to additional powers which
could be granted to committees. They recommend that committees be granted full powers to make arrangements for the training of local men locally; authority to grant accommodation at Exchanges; authority to deal with all matters at present dealt with by the Local War Pensions Committee, in order to avoid overlapping ; authority to sanction the issue of railway warrants in cases where an applicant produces evidence of an offer of employment outside the district; authority to supervise local staff engagements; power to vary the hours during which the Exchange is open to the public ; and power to set up forthwith a Juvenile Employment Committee irrespective of the provisions of the Labour Exchanges Act, 1909, or the Education (Choice of Employment) Act, 1910.Employment. Recommendations from committees on the question of spare-time and overtime working are still being received. Kingston instance cases of postmen, policemen and local authority employees accepting other employment during their spare time, and so keeping out of employment many men at present on the registers. Bradford call attention to the overtime being worked in local engineering firms, and suggest that the firms working overtime should sub-let to firms whose workmen are unemployed or under-employed.Training. A member of the Lewisham Committee reported on a visit he had paid to the Cricklewood training centre and expressed satisfaction at the work done there. He suggested that increased facilities should be given to members of trade unions and building federations serving on committees to visit the different training centres. This suggestion was unanimously adopted by the committee. Exeter and Romford suggest the opening of local training centres for the domestic training of women.General  Further protests with regard to the lack of accommodation or unsuitability of accommodation at many Exchanges have been received, the latest complaints being from Chelmsford, who state that they cannot accept responsibility and carry on their duties as a committee unless something is done at once to secure better accommodation.OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFIT.Out-of-Work Donation. Returns by the Finance Department, according to information received at the Claims and Record Office, Kew, for the week ending the 24th February, show 408,768 payments to policy holders, involving an amount of  369,146 7s. i)d.Unemployment Insurance. The number of payments of unemployment insurance benefit during the week ending the 18th February was 838,732, involving an amount of  456,160 16s. id.DISCHARGED AND DISABLED SAILORS AND SOLDIERS.National Scheme. Up to and including the 1st March, 24,380 certificates have been issued to employees under this scheme. The undertakings given by these employers cover 270,899 disabled ex-Service men.The Divisional Controller for the South-Western Division considers that some special provision is necessary to meet the case of those men who are too old for training, and who are difficult to place in employment. It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain employment for these men, especially under the present depressed industrial conditions.JUVENILE BRANCH.Co-operation with Juvenile Organisations. As the result of a conference between the Chelmsford Juvenile Advisory Committee and representatives of the various organisations for boys and girls in Chelmsford, a joint committee is to be set up to supplement the work of the Advisory Committee, and to prevent overlapping, both in the work of after-care and in the activities of the organisations themselves.Day Continuation Schools. The London Building Apprenticeship Committee have been informed by the education officer of the London County Council that boys who attend trade classes under the terms of the committee&apos;s apprenticeship scheme are regarded as satisfying the requirements of the Education Act, 1918, as regards attendance at day continuation schools. This ruling will also apply to girl learners in various needle trades, who, in accordance with an agreement made with the London Employers&apos; Association, attend learners&apos; classes attached to the CounciTs trade schools for girls, and to other learners who attend day classes with an approved curriculum for not less than 8 hours per week.[Reference to matters of interest to the Employment and Insurance Department will also be found on pages 245, 252, 253, 263, 264 and 268.]
APPOINTMENTS AND TRAINING.APPOINTMENTS AND  CIVIL LIABILITIES DEPARTMENT.APPOINTMENTS.Statistics. During the week ending the 25th February the Appointments Department placed 471 candidates for appointments, bringing the total number of candidates known to have been placed to 50,952. Of these 6,852 have been placed through the agency of the departments Interviewing Boards. Applications were registered from 734 ex-Service men and 26 civilians. The number of candidates available for appointments on the 25th February was 11,217 ex-Service men and 1,379 civilians. At the same date 881 &quot;live&quot; vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 411 having been registered during the week.BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING.Maintenance and Training Grants Scheme. During the week ending the 25th February the Appointments Department received applications for training under this scheme from 13 officers or men of similar educational qualifications, of which 7 were for training of the type provided by the department. Deducting cancellations and withdrawals, 28,158 applica-tions for training of this latter type have been received in all, and 49,527 for training of the type provided by other Government departments. The Interviewing Boards have dealt with 27,791 applications, of which 23,291 have been recommended. The Grants Committee, dealing with applications so recommended, have received 22,176 applications and sanctioned grants in 18,345 cases.Business Training Scheme. During the week ending the 25th February, the Appoint-ments Department received 137 applications for training under this scheme, bringing the total number of applications to 2,535, of which 655 have since been cancelled. Grants have been sanctioned in 555 cases. At the same date, 307 training vacancies were at the disposal of the department, 57 having been registered during the week.Training of Disabled Officers under Pensions Warrant. The Appointments Department have dealt with a total of 1,088 cases, in 478 of which the training sanctioned is provided by the Appointments Department, and in the remainder by other Government departments. Candidates accepted by the Ministry of Labour have completed training in 291 cases, and abandoned training in 46 ; 128 are still in training and 13 awaiting training.TRAINING  DEPARTMENT. INDUSTRIAL TRAINING.Disabled and Other Ex-Service Men.Statistics. On the 1st March, 24,822 men were in training, as against 25,072 on the 22nd February, and 25,185 on the 1st February. During the week 438 men were placed in training. There were 16,160 men awaiting training, the corresponding totals for the 22nd February and the 1st February being 16,141 and 16,181 respectively. The number of men whose training had been completed since the 1st August, 1919, was 27,220, the totals for the 22nd February and the 1st February being 26,532 and 24,990 respectively.The drop in the number of men in training is largely to be accounted for by a rather marked falling off in the London figures, owing to an exceptional number of terminations of workshop training. Reports from the divisions show that, were it not for the restrictions in the building trade, the figures would again show an advance, as in practically every area there are numerous places available for training in this branch of industry, and men waiting to fill them.Elementary Teachers. Treasury sanction has now been obtained for the establishment of a Training College for manual instructors in the building which has been acquired at Erith, and the necessary alterations will be taken in hand as rapidly as possible. Repre-sentatives of the Association of Directors and Secretaries for Education-visited, during the week, the Training College section at Sarisbury Court. They appear to have been favourably impressed with the character and keenness of the students and the type of work which is being carried out.
Exhibitions. The exhibition in the Annexe at the Daily Mail Efficiency Exhibition has had good results from the point of view both of the placing of partly trained men, and of the value of the goods sold. There is reason to believe that 260 men will be placed in improvership vacancies, as a direct result of inquiries received from employers, while the publicity which the display has given should encourage employers to provide openings for improvers in their workshops when trade conditions begin to show signs of improvement.Government Instructional Factories. All the carpentry, painting, plumbing and brick-laying involved in the adaptations at the Hare Hall Factory is to be carried out by men in training on the spot. The contract which H.M. Office of Works have entrusted to these men is to the value of  3,000.On the 28th February, the Minister and Mrs. Macnamara visited the Lavender Hill Factory, where there are 146 men under instruction in the tailoring trade. After an inspection of the workrooms, the Minister presented medals and diplomas to the successful competitors in the recent Tailor and Cutter competition. The tailoring classes at Rathbone Place were afterwards inspected, and here also the Minister made a presentation of medals and diplomas to men who had taken part in the competition. Of 19 men entered from this centre, 17 received either medals or special commendation.At the Cathcart Factory, Glasgow, sales during February exceeded  250, and there are contracts still in hand to the value of over  1,000.At the High Road Factory, Tottenham, sales of goods manufactured by the tailoring class during the month amounted to over  200, and there are contracts in hand to the value of nearly  300.Women&apos;s Training.Registered Unemployed Women. Resolutions have been received from Local Employ -ment Committees, Municipal Councils, and other bodies, recommending that special schemes should be organised to provide training in domestic work and needlecrafts for women in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit or out-of-work donation. The Women&apos;s Training Branch have been prevented from undertaking the organisation of such courses by difficulties arising from the fact that, as at present arranged, the Women&apos;s Training Scheme ceases to be operative on the 31st March. It has not, therefore, been practicable since the end of January to initiate fresh schemes, since adequate training could not be given.  There are at present only 71 women in training.Training of War Widows. Inquiries show that, with rare exceptions, the widows make very good use of the knowledge and skill they have acquired. In one instance a widow who is obliged to live in a small village is fully engaged in giving instruction to young women operatives at a cotton mill in the village. An officers widow, who trained at the Norland Institute as a children&apos;s nurse, has obtained a post to go to India with a family. Another officers widow has commenced training in opera singing with a view to qualifying for a post with a first-class opera company which has been promised to her.Authority has now been obtained for the supply of knitting machines to war widows, in special cases, where they are prevented from taking outside employment by reason of their health and age, or the fact that they are obliged to look after delicate children and cannot make arrangements for absence from home in order to attend a course of training in dressmaking.Training of Disabled Nurses. Eighty nurses, in all, have commenced training, and of these 13 are temporarily withdrawn for reasons of health and are undergoing treatment in hospital or convalescent homes. Dispensing continues to be a favourite occupation. Of 29 who&apos; commenced training in this profession last year, 8 have passed the Apothecaries&apos; Hall examination.Apprenticeships Interrupted by Service.Statistics.-Up to the 2nd March agreements had been received at headquarters in respect of 45,857 apprentices under the 41 schemes approved. Grants had been sanctioned in respect of 43,783 apprentices, employed by 17,417 employers. The total number of agreements lapsed on expiration of the appropriate period of training, or by mutual agreement between the parties, is now 19,846.
Wages. Further complaints are reported in regard to the high rate of wages established by the Trade Boards in certain industries. In the North-western area, two apprentices under the bootmaking and repairing scheme have been discharged, and, up to the present, have not been re-instated.Applications. The number of &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices in the London and South-Eastern area is now estimated at 116. The apprentices have been addressed collectively, and written to, with a view to their taking up institutional training as a provisional measure.Acceptance or Non-Acceptance. The decision of the Aberdeen Master Plumbers&apos; Association, not to bring apprentices under the scheme, has resulted in a controversy with the Corporation, who refuse to accept tenders for contracts in connection with their housing scheme from any employer not complying with the Interrupted Apprenticeship Scheme. The trade union, in support of the master plumbers, have expelled certain of their members employed in non-union firms working for the Corporation. The local office, however, have taken up the matter with the Deputy Town Clerk, ensuring payment of the State grant by the department, as it is thought that this assurance may favourably influence the attitude of the master plumbers.Termination of Agreements. Engineering employers in the South-Western area are endeavouring to get rid of apprentices at the end of five years of training, whether the period of State assistance has terminated or not. They give little or no reason except that there is no work to do. Efforts are being made by the local staff to prevent this, but in no case brought before the Trade Panels have damages been assessed. No resort has been made to legal proceedings.Unemployment. Trade depression still continues to have its effect on apprentices under the scheme. In the London and South-Eastern area a number of &quot; unmated &quot; apprentices under the scheme are at present unemployed. In the Northern area the west coast, as well as the east, is feeling the industrial depression most acutely; one firm at Workington will be dismissing 4,000 employees within about one week. Where employers in Wales are finding it difficult to retain apprentices, they are being prevailed upon to put the apprentices on half-time, rather than dismiss them, but in some cases even this is not possible. Efforts are being made to effect an occasional transfer.General Training.Apprenticeship: Building. In the West Midlands, there are seven districts with a population exceeding 50,000 ; in all but two of these progress has been made with the national scheme. In one, a committee is in being ; in two, joint conferences are about to be held ; and in the fourth and fifth, it only remains to bring the employers into line. In ten towns, not included above, with a population between 22,000 and 48,000, one has a committee, four have arranged joint conferences, three are giving the matter favourable consideration, and, in the two others, the operatives have agreed to the scheme. Two smaller towns have agreed to a joint conference. This progress, however, has not been made without opposition and apathy on the part of certain employers and operatives.Provisional dates have been fixed for a mass meeting of employers in the Cleveland district. This district will comprise^ Hartlepool, West Hartlepool, Stockton, Middles-brough, and Thornaby and district. A meeting has been arranged for the employers of Darlington and district, on the 22nd March. Endeavours are being made to arrange a meeting for Carlisle at the earliest possible moment, thus bringing the whole of the West coast, in the Northern area, under organisation. It is hoped to fix an early date for the meeting at Berwick.At York, a resolution was passed approving the scheme, and the matter was referred to the associations on both sides for consideration of details. Meetings are to be held at Halifax, Harrogate and Huddersfield on the 9th, 10th and 18th March, and, it is hoped, at Scarborough, Whitby and Malton shortly after Easter.At Sheffield, several employers have been interviewed, including the president of the master builders&apos; association, but without success. A scheme has already been put into operation here on the lines of the Harrogate Apprenticeship Committee Scheme ; the master builders therefore do not see the need for the national scheme.The Northampton employers have decided to meet on the 21st March, when 200 are expected to be present.  At Bolton, where a joint meeting was held recently, the various
trade unions are discussing the matter favourably, and at St. Helens, the trade unions are electing representatives to attend a joint meeting.Technical and Continuation Classes for Junior Apprentices (Northampton). The education committee for Northampton have organised day technical courses and evening continuation courses for apprentices under the age of 16, in connection with which a &quot; time-off &quot; scheme has been instituted, whereby these junior apprentices are allowed to attend one morning each week without losing wages, or paying the class fees. The Northampton Boot Manufacturing Association, and the employers in the tanning, engineering, textile, grocery and other trades, have adopted the scheme, with the hearty support of the trade unions. An appeal is being made to every employer in Northampton to fall into line. The day classes already provide for artisan courses, commercial courses and general courses for boys in miscellaneous trades. An attempt will also be made to build up recreational and social activities for the junior course students.[Reference to matters of interest to the Appointments and Training Departments will also be found on pages 252 and 261.]
