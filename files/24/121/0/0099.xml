3 Document is the Prepay oiCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.Proposed Reduction of the Harrison of Mesopotamia.I have no desire to raise any point of controversy on this question. But it appears to me that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff does not altogether accurately interpret in his note the Cabinet decision to which he  j. refers. He describes it as a decision &quot; by which the Creeks are given freedom of action against the Turks.&apos;1 I understand that his reference is to the decision of the 22nd March which is recorded as follows ; -That the War Office should inform the Military Adviser of the Greek Delegation that the British Government could not, of course, restrain the 11th Greek Division from leaving the British Command, but, as we could not be concerned in any operations they might undertake, the Greek Government must make their own arrauge-ments as regards supplies for the 1.1th Division from the moment when it leaves the British Command ;and the record further shows that &quot;The Cabinet were generally agreed that, while we would not prevent the Greeks from withdrawing their forces, it must be made perfectly clear to them that if they were taking part in offensive operations against the Turks they could not be fed from the British base, and that our responsibility for them would cease from the moment that they ceased to be under our command.&quot;I merely draw attention to these facts to make it clear that the Cabinet is not committed to the policy of the results of which the Chief of the Imperial General Stall1 seems rightly to be apprehensive.K 8. M.4th April 1921.369-2     100
