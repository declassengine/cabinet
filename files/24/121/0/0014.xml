Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1921.CONFIDENTIAL.SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.LORD LINLITHGO W yesterday had down a question in the House of Lords to ask whether, in view of the recommendations of the Remuneration of Ministers Committee, it was proposed during the present Session to raise the status of the Secretary for Scotland.Lord Linlithgow postponed his question at my request and to meet my personal convenience, and he has put down the question again without fixing&apos; a clay on which it is to be asked. It would not be reasonable that lie should he expected to allow any long delay to interpose before he brings the matter forward, and it will not then be possible to ask for further postponement.It is therefore, in my view, imperative that the Cabinet should arrive at a decision on the answer to be given to the question when it is asked.The question has several times formed the subject of discussion both in the Lords and in the Commons., and the utterances of the Prime Minister, of Mr. Bonar Law and of myself, acting upon the advice given to me by the Scottish Office, appear to me to commit us irrevocably. I think it is sufficient on this point to cite the answer given by the Prime Minister to the question asked on the 22nd July, 1920, by Mr. Wallace : &quot; The Government recognise fully the justice of the demand unanimously made by Scottish Members that the status of the Secretary for Scotland should be raised to that of a Secretary of State. The Government hope to deal with this subject in the Autumn Session.&quot;On the 22nd June, 1920, in answer to a question asked by Lord Linlithgow, I myself said: &quot; I, and I think most Ministers, have very great sympathy with the case put forward by the noble Marquess. I myself have not been able to understand what historic accident deprives Scotland of the status and importance which is supplied by the representation of a Secretary of State. . . . It has always seemed to me difficult to answer the question as to the relative expenditure in the cases respectively of Ireland and Scotland.&quot;jOn the 29th July, 1920, Lord Linlithgow moved the Second Reading of a Bill to raise the status of the Secretary for Scotland to that of Secretary of State. Lord Stanmore, speaking for the Government, said: &quot; The Government fully recognise the justice of the claim. . . . The Government hope to deal with this subject in the Autumn Session,&quot; and Lord Milner added that, &quot; the Government really are anxious to proceed in this matter.&quot; He assented to a Second Reading, but thought it would be most convenient that the matter should be dealt with by a Government Bill originating in the House of Commons, and continued, &quot; If, however, for any reason which I do not anticipate, the Government were prevented from taking up the matter at a later stage of the Session, it would always be possible for the noble Lord&quot; to go on with the then Bill.It appears to me that in the face of these declarations, it is extremely difficult for me, when pressed by Lord Liniithgow, to do otherwise than give a further promise on behalf of the Government.Apart from these commitments, however, the case appears to me to be a strong-one upon its merits.The Select Committee of the House of Commons on Remuneration of Ministers made &quot;a special recommendation that the Secretary for Scotland and the President [5881]
of the Board of Education be raised to first class rank. In the former case, a Lord Advocate on being appointed Secretary for Scotland has had to sacrifice 3,0007. of his salary, the superior position being paid less than the lower.&quot;The Secretary for Scotland receives a less sum per annum than the Under-Secretary, the President of the Board of Health or the Secretary of the Scottish Education Department. He is, in fact, in a position which is scarcely analogous to that of any one English Minister, for he combines in his own person the functions of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, Minister for Education, Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture each of those Departments in England being controlled by a separate Minister who is a member of the Cabinet. In addition, he controls some ten other Boards in Scotland. In fact, it may be said that, whatever claims may be put forward by other Ministers in respect of the importance of their respective Departments, the Secretary for Scotland represents not a Department but a country.In these circumstances, I hope very earnestly that I may be placed in a position in&apos; which, when Lord Linlithgow&apos;s question is again put, I may be able to give an affirmative reply.B.March 11, 1921.mm
