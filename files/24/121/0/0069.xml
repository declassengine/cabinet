This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.   4SECRET.CP. 2768.THE CABINET.PROPOSED REDUCTION OF THE GARRISON OFMESOPOTAMIA.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to Cabinet 14 (21), Conclusion 5, I circulate a Note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the proposed reductions of the garrison of Mesopotamia.L. W.-E.The War Office,Uth March, 1921,S. of S.I have raised no objections to the proposal put forward by Mr. Churchill in the direction of reducing the garrison of Mesopotamia. These proposals are based on certain political measures which have always been advocated by the General Staff as being the essential preliminaries to any such reduction, the chief being the re-establish-ment of our traditional relationship with the Turks, and the provision thereby of a buffer against Bolshevik intrigue and the cessation of Islamic propaganda. I must, however, point out that the recent Cabinet decision, by which the Greeks are given freedom of action against the Turks, can hardly fail to acerbate our relations with the Turks and lead to closer relations between them and the Bolsheviks, which otherwise appear to be severely strained by events in Georgia. Whilst at the present moment I do not suggest that any change should be made in the orders issued for the reduction of the garrison in Mesopotamia since, in any case, these will take a considerable time before they can be put into effect I must warn you that it may be necessary to stop the above reduction if Mr. ChurchiH&apos;s military calculations are upset by the removal of their political basis.H. W.(B21/131)   100   3/21   H&amp;S, Ltd.  9052wo
