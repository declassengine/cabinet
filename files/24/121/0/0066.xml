SUMMARY.PRANCE.The East End of Paris, the Chief Communist stronghold of France, has decided against the Communists ut &apos;1 by-election. In the first ballot the Communists, who undoubtedly polled their full strength, obtained only 33,000 votes out of a total of 187,000,The order of dissolution of the Confederation Generate du Travail is to be considered as a Government warning against joining the extreme Communists. The Confederation as constituted under the Trades Union Law of 188-1 has been dissolved, but reformed under the Associations Law of 1902. The C.G.T. shows signs of a chastened spirit. Its National Council has renounced Moscow and all its works, expressing the view that Lenin&apos;s organisation has been formed to disintegrate and destroy International Trade Unionism.The trial of 10 leaders of tho General Strike which began in Paris on February 28th, on a charge of conspiracy against tho safety of the State, ended in their acquittal, the general impression being that the indictment was of so general a nature as to constitute a prosecution of opinion,The police continue hot on the track of Communist conspiracies, and arrests occur all over France and in Algeria and Tunis. Tho Paris police are rounding up undesirable foreigners, and the creation of a special police brigade to deal with foreigners is mooted.The growth of unemployment is causing anxiety, and industrial employers are limiting their purchases abroad to absolute necessities.BELGIUM.Bolshevik activity is again apparent in the Liege district, where recently arrived Russian subjects are the principal agitators. The labour situation is calm, notwithstanding unemployment, especially in Antwerp, and general discontent at proposed reductions of wages.LUXEMBOURG.The Grand Duchy is at present seriously disturbed. A strike, which began as a movement of sympathy with the discharge of workers from tho iron and steel works, became practically general, the workers seizing mines, workshops, and foundries. French troops were called in to expel the occupants.ITALY.The industrial crisis remains acute. Serious factors are the unfavour-able exchange and want of credit abroad. On the land unrest is considered likely to continue. Troubles between Fnscisii and Communists continue to rage, and recent fighting in Florence was reminiscent of mediaeval days. In the matter of the Bread Bill the Socialists have been following a purely obstructive policy with a consequent daily loss to the country of 15,000,000 lire in supplying bread at less than half its cost.The Italian Government prefers London to Eeval as the scene of its negotiations with the Soviet Government regarding a commercial treaty.The Pope is reported to bo determined to maintain his non-committal attitude on the Irish question.SPAIN.Syndicalism would appear to have been scotched, but by no means killed,  The murder of the Premier on the night of March 8th was due 2
act of Syndicalist vengeance. The round-up of Syndicalists continues throughout Spain.NORWAY.The year 1920 established a record for the intensity of Communist ferment. Moscow would appear to he surreptitiously welding the Communists and Syndicalists. At Christianin Bolshevism remains stationary, Cliristiania students passed a resolution protesting against the Governments action in banning Russian literature as an interference with the liberty of the subject.SWEDEN,The general reduction of wages is causing dissatisfaction among the workers. The authorities are disquieted by the activities of the Rosta, regarding whose propaganda they havo received secret representations from the Danish and Norwegian Governments.DENMARK.The Russian Commissariat for Foreign Trade and their Trade Delegation abroad are at loggerheads with the Clearing House at Copenhagen.HOLLAND.Communist attempts to stir up the unemployed are reported to be unsuccessful. Correspondence between Moscow and tho Communist Party in Holland is said to be dwindling, but Germany is still the weak point. Communist activities are hampered by the difficulties which known leaders find in travelling, and which the present system of passport control effectively maintains.GERMANY.It appears probable that the German Government, indirectly through big commercial organisations like those of Stinnes&apos;, is engaging the co-operation of the Bolsheviks in breaking the Versailles Treaty, while tho Bolshevik Trading Party, through the same channels, are trying lo achieve tho welding together of the two countries, which is the aim of their policy. Militant Bolsheviks meanwhile hope that the connection will put them in a favourable position to extend their propaganda and make a Spartacist Germany. The attitude of the masses towards the Government is reported to be one of absolute indifference. On the other hand, Kopp is reported to have been pessimistic in a recent report to Moscow in which he talked of the inner and bourgeois mentality of the German proletariat.The Moscow Executive is responsible for fostering a revolt in the Gorman Communist Party by admitting a delegate of the Communist Labour Party as a &quot; sympathising &quot; member of the Third International. Tho leaders of the Communist Party first sent a protest to Moscow against this approach to their rivals, and towards the end of the month Paul Levi Daeumig, Adolf Hoffmann, and Klara Zetkin withdrew from the Executive of the United Communist Party.Berlin now becomes a sub-bureau of LitvinofFs &quot; Embassy&quot; at Reval, and Kopp, if he survives the change, will do so as the Charge d&apos;Affaires under Litvinoff. Ilia Reich has been replaced by Stomaniakoff&apos;, a protege of Krassin&apos;s.A representative conference of Indians arranged by Chattopadya and the Russian Soviet Government, and held in Berlin, decided to organise an &quot;Indian Revolutionary Society,&quot; including both Communists and
3714aNationalists, and unite the parties working all over the world for the emancipation of India.AUSTRIA.The Vienna International, variously known as the &quot;Pink&quot; or the &quot;Two and a Half International,&quot; opened on February 22nd. The delegates included representatives of the British Independent Labour Party, French Socialists, and German Independent Socialists.Communist relations with the Social Democrats, their most dangerous rivals, are strained. The Communists rely mainly upon the revolutionary WorkmenV and Soldiers&apos; Councils and a system of confidential agents.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Tho Government are acting forcibly against revolutionary agents. The dissolution of the Russian Hod Cross Mission is announced. The Czeoho-Slovak Labour Socialist Party in Prague has condemned Com. munist methods and the Communists tendency of the Left Socialists.RUSSIA.Unrest, vital and organically morbid, continues, and culminated towards the end of the month in risings of varied importance and intensity all ovor the country.At the beginning of February there were revolts of the peasants of Kostroma and Jaroslav on account of the seizure of seed. Similar riots took place in the Governments of Samara and Saratov. These were succeeded by tho conflict between tho sailors at Kronstadt and the Soviet Government, which the latter endeavoured to hush up. Disturbances in Pctrograd became serious on February 23rd. By March 3rd Petrograd and Kronstadt were very reliably reported to be held by counter-revolutionaries. At Sajasau and Jaroslav, at Kasan, at Kalvaa, at Orel, at Briansk, and at Moscow there were risings against the Government. At Moscow the street fighting seems to have been confined to the suburbs and tho rising appears to have been suppressed by March 8th. At Kronstadt the revolutionaries proclaimed themselves as of no party, but as fighting for a true Soviet Government against the tyranny of the present regime. Whatever their ultimate political tendency might become, they apparently realised for the time being that Leninism diverted towards democracy was the most expedient policy for them to adopt.The economic situation becomes worse day by day. Tho reduction of the food rations, the failure of the fuel supply, which has brought about the closing down even of large factories and workshops, has caused great depression in Moscow and Petrograd.Instructions transmitted by Tchitcherin to his representatives abroad lay down a new Foreign Policy, the fomentation by intrigue and mischief making of International strife among the nations of the West. The International position of the Soviet Government is to be stabilised with a view to its full recognition by Western countries. Meanwhile, the policy of revolution will be contiuued and placed under control of the Soviet representatives in different countries, definite spheres being allocated to their activities in trade and diplomacy on the one hand, and with the branches of the Third International ou the other. These instructions reflect the growing feeling iu Bolshevik circles that propaganda and peaceful penetration have given disappointing results and that Inter-national intrigue leading to war between capitalist countries will prove the better way.With the signature of the trade agreement in London the principal question  as regards Russian foreign trade is tho question of trade
with Germany and the&apos; position of Poland with regard to it. It is Mr, Kmssin&apos;s aim to make it possible for Russian gold to bo sold in London. Tho right to use the proceed-) as he thought lit and to employ English currency for conversion into marks or kronen enables him to finance orders in Germany without brokerage on the part of foreign capitalists. Mr. Krassiu objects to anything like a control of German industry or tho establishment of working understandings between English and German firms.ESTHONIA.lievalj London, aud Rome are reliably reported as the general centres for the future of Bolshevik diplomacy abroad. From the moment of LitvinofPs arrival a recrudescence of secret activities on the part of the Communists in Reval appears to have been noticed.ROUMANIA.The Roumanian Socialist Party has split upon the Third Inter-national issue. The Communists and Social Democrats have formed separate parties.TURKEY.Russo-Turkish relations urc not so smooth as they are being made to appear. An account is given of an interview on March 1st with the late Talaat Pasha.PERSIA.On February 21st the Kasvin and llamadan sections of the Persian Cossack Brigade under Riza Khan marched upon Tehran and substituted an administration determined not to bo bullied by the Bolsheviks for the then existing&quot; inefficient&quot; Government. Riza Khan ex pressed deference to the authority of the Shah. Tho acceptance of the new administration by the Bakhtiaris secured support from the provinces.GEORGIA.Ou February 26th advices from Constantinople announced the fall of Tiflis on the previous day and tho retirement on Kutais of the Georgian forces before what the Georgians themselves described as the entire Soviet forces in the Caucasus : Russian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian.CANADA.Unemployment shows little improvement, but the danger point seems to have passed, and the cut in wages is being accepted philosophically. A comprehensive, ably organised scheme for launching an official Communist Party in Canada is reported.SOUTH AFRICA.The result of the general election was a complete vindication of General Smuts&apos; policy. The lightning strike of the Rand miners on the eve of the elections was strongly resented by the public, and contributed largely to the Labour debacle.UNITED STATES OP AMERICA.The activities oi&apos; the Communist Party are less visible than a year ago, but its uuderground work is said to be a good deal more effective. Except in certain newspapers there is little evidence of active resentment against this country in America, and despite the boasts of the Irish Americans the amount of American money sent to Ireland is compara-tively small. A committee of four, under the leadership of Dr. Hart-man, the editor of &quot; Soviet Russia,&quot; has taken over the work of Ludwig Martens, late representative of the Soviet Government in New York.
CONFIDENTIAL.REPORT No. 87, JANUARY 1921.Erratum.Page 69, line 36,/or &quot; that the proofs &quot; read &quot;from the proofs.A Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign Countries.PART I.1. LATIN COUNTRIES. FRANCE.Socialists and Communists.Out of the confusion into which French Socialism lias been thrown emerge three parties. One is the party led by Cachin anil Frossard, which has definitely espoused Bolshevism ; the second, the opposing party of which Longuet and Renaudel are the leading spirits, the one representing the&quot; constructors &quot; and the other the &quot;dissidents,&quot; and both opposed to the dictatorship of Moscow; and the third, the party composed of the first dissidents, who were excluded at the time of the last Parlia-mentary elections. The reconstructors are considering whether or not M. Albert Thomas shall retain his seat in Parliament. The dissidents have pronounced in favour of the minimum programme of the Confederation Generate du Travail and against Bolshevism. They repudiate &quot; in the &quot; most categoric fashion the proletarian dictatorship exercised by the &quot; Russian Communists . . . Far from liberating the proletariat, &quot; Sovietic methods are leading to a dictatorial imperialism in which the &quot; French people will never acquiesce.&quot;Communists and other Extremists.The figures of the first ballot in a by-election in the East Fuel of Paris, the chief Communist stronghold of France, show that the Communists, who undoubtedly polled their full strength, number only 33,000 electors out of a total of 187,000. The &quot; Bloc National &quot; candidates secured 47,000 votes. It may reasonably be deduced that the Communists do not number more than four or five per cent, of the total French electorate. At the second ballot, which has just taken place, in six out of the seven arrondissements a substantial majority was obtained in favour of the &quot; Bloc National.&quot; This majority was obtained in spite of the withdrawal of the centre and left Socialist candidates, which left the issue entirely between the Bloc and the Communists.The Paris taxi-cab drivers, who turned out their moderate committee, have npw taken another vote, and the Reds have been defeated. The compositors, on the other hand, have gone over to the extremists.At, the elections of the Executive Committee of the Trade Union of Employees of the Seine all the extremist candidates were defeated by members of the Confederation general du Travail.The Position oi the Confgd&amp;ation Generate du Travail.French Trades Unionists are said to be very well aware that the order of dissolution of the C.G.T. is formal only a Governmental warning against joining the extreme Communists and that it will have no effect on future trade unionism.   Such moderates as Jouhaux and Bidegaray
will seek a majority at the next Natioual Congress by pointing out the ruin to which political strikes have led. Actually the C.G.T. constituted under the Trades Union Law of 15S8-1 has been dissolved, but it has been re-formed under the Associations Law of 1902. Nothing, therefore, has changed, except the date of the Law under which the organisation is constituted.The split at Tours has had its natural sequence in the decision of the National Council of the COLT, to renounce Moscow and all its works. By 88 votes to 21 the Council approved a resolution refusing to leave the Amsterdam International for the Moscow International, and expressing the view that Lenii^s organisation has been formed to disintegrate and destroy International Trade Unionism, Further resolutions definitely exclude from the C.G.T. all unions or other organisations which adhere to Moscow. Tho 0.(1.T. shows signs of a chastened spirit and is industriously setting its house in order. It is alleged by one authority that there have been a million defections from the C.G.T., which, before the strikes, had 1,600,000 adherents, douhaux now advocates trade control of industry really a type of Bolshevism which was proposed not long ago for the metal trade and rejected by the employers. Other features of the programme are Trade Union rights for all, including State officials, and general nationalisation of industry and wealth.By 82 votes to 31, tho Natioual Confederal Committee of the C.G.T., has decided that the Confederation shall be controlled by French citbens ami not by Moscow.The Trial oi the Strike Leaders.The trial of 10 leaders of the general strike last May, which opened in Paris on February 28th, ended in the acquittal of the accused, who were charged with conspiracy against the safety of the Slate. They included the notorious Boris Lifschitz, better known as Souvariue, Loriot, Mouatte, and Momuousseau, members of (lie French Committee of the Third International and the most militant of French extremists. The prosecution aimed at establishing that the prisoners fomented and organised revolutionary movement under the direction of, and with funds furnished by, Moscow, to set up a Communist dictatorship working hand in hand with Lenin and his satellites. The organisations concerned are the Committee of the Third International, the French section of the Communist Party, and the Communist Federation of Soviets, to one or other of which all the prisoners belonged. A curiously varied array of witnesses was called for tho prisoners, including Zinovieff, Kopp, MM. Anatole Franco, Victor Marguenttc, and Leon Daudot.The judge gave Monatte pride of place as leader of the conspiracy, but Souvarine who takes his pseudonym from the Anarchist in Zola&apos;s &quot; Germinal&quot; was really the chief leader of the affair. Loriot, like Mouatte, was au elementary school teacher. He and Souvariue were Bolshevik candidates for seats in the Chamber for one of the Paris districts.The acquittal of the accused was due to the prevailing impression that the indictment was of so general a nature as to constitute a prosecu-tiou of opinion.The Communist Conspiracies.The police continue hot on the track of Communist conspiracies. One significant discovery has been that of a plot for undermining young conscripts. The carrying ou of a campaign in the Army is one of the conditions of adhesion to tho Third International. Tho police have seized the copies of an obscure paper called &quot;Le Consent,&quot; and the manager will be charged with inciting to pillage, murder, and disobedience.
373A number of youths belonging to &quot; Jeuuesses Communistes &quot; are being questioned ; lit Marseilles, where there has been a large distribution of anti-militarist tracts, fifteen young men have been arrested, Documents seized at the headquarters of the Federation include the correspondence between the Federation and the Russian Soviet Delegation in Berlin. A Spanish agitator, one Angel Delgado, said to ho one of the heads of the Spanish revolutionary party, has been arrested at Bordeaux. Dolgado seems to have served as au intermediary between Spanish and French extremists.All that concerns Great Britain in the alleged Communist plot is the discovery of complaints made by Humbert Droz, the Swiss Communist, of the difficulties mot with in obtaining Communist support in England, and a request that French Communists should use their influence with McLean ami Sylvia Pankhurst to further Communism in the United Kingdom,Later advices, in fact, tend to diminish tin; proportions of tho plot. The investigations into Communist activities have established that AbramovitchV deposit in an American bank in Paris was 200,000 francs, the money coming from (lie Markieviez bank in Berlin by a cheque drawn ou the Paris branch of the American bank. Abramovitch himself cashed cheques for the greater part of this amount. Before the examining magistrate Abramovitch explained that he drew 15,000 francs for establishing the review &quot;Internationale Comrnunisto,&quot; for buying a lease, and for personal expenses. Later he drew 50,000 francs which he sent abroad on becoming convinced that the review could not be started in France. lie admits that he adopted the name of Abramovitch after his escape from Siberia, but denies that he ever belonged to the Soviet Government. His role was that of editor of the &quot;Internationale Coni-muniste,&quot; which he failed to establish in France. The police are on (ho track of a second Bolshevik agent, reported to he an Italian and, like Abrainoviloh, an intermediary between Moscow and French Communism, operating in England as well as France. A. quantity of explosives stolon from the Societe Generale d&apos;Enireprises at Monistral d&apos;Allier (llautc-Loire) has been found in the houses of admirers of Abramovitch. The authorities have now provisionally released Mine. Zalewski, wife of Abramovitch. There is no proof that she manufactured false passports, but she will be charged with using one. The two Serbians, Guaratovitch and Kossanovitoh, have also been released, it is announced that there are clear proofs of an internal and external plot against the security of the State.   Arrests continue all over France, and in Algeria and Tunis.The Position of M. Thomas.M. Albert Thomas has resigned his seat in Parliament, the salary for which is 27,000 francs a year, and retained his post as President of the League of Nations International Labour Bureau at a salary of 20,000 dollars a year. Piquancy was added to M. Thomas&apos; dilemma by the refusal of the Tarn Federation M. Thomas is deputy for the Tarn to accept his resignation. M. Thomas bowed to its decision. What action the National Council of the Socialist Party will take is not yet known.Miscellaneous.The constant growth of unemployment is causing much anxiety. In combination with the Government the industrial employers are limiting their purchases abroad to absobite necessities, in order to provide employment and to reduce the unfavourable rates of exchange against France.The Government proposes drastic new regulations governing tho residence of foreigners in France.   The exercise of certain professions by
foreigner.-! will he barred, unless the authority of the Government is obtained. Tho l&apos;aris police are meanwhile rounding up undesirable foreigners, and it is stated that a special police brigade dealing exclusively with foreigners is to be created.BELGIUM.Extremist Movements.Bolshevik&apos;activity is again apparent in the Liege district. Russian subjects, many of them apparently recent arrivals, are the principal agitators. Boris Sokoloff attempted to address a meeting, but bad to give up, owing to the interference of Russian and Belgian Communists. The interrupters are to be identified if possible, and the foreigners among them will have to leave the country if their papers arc not in order.Only a dozen people attended a special Communist meeting at Sehaorbeck, at which \Y. Van Overstraelen declared that the English proletariat was firmer and more decided than any other, except the Russian, and thai when revolution was ripe England would show a united front. At another meeting at Molenbcek, Van Ovcrslraeten bitterly attacked tho &quot; Parti Ouvrier BolgQ,&quot; which he described as being in an advanced state of putrefaction; he also attacked tho &quot; Exploile &quot; group as untrue to Marxism. Some members of the &quot;Parti Ouvrier&quot; seemed inclined to agree with Van Overstraeten, who later advocated the banding together, as missionaries of the Intellectuals, the &quot;Fine Fleur de Connminismc.&quot; It was not absolutely necessary blindly to follow Moscow, which might mistake the methods to follow in other countries.Van Overstraeten announced that the &quot; Ouvrier Communiste &quot; would shortly appear every week, and that a review containing Communist articles for the workers, was also to be published. General meetings of workers, at which Communism will be preached, are also to be held on Saturdays and Sundays.Jacquemotte&apos;s new campaign to strengthen &quot; Les Amis de 1&apos;Exploite &quot; continues. Access to the &quot;Maisons du Peuple&quot; is necessary for the promotion of revolutionary ideas and of the sale of &quot; L&apos;Exploite.&quot; But the authorities of the &quot;Maisons du Peuple&quot; are showing themselves reluctant to put. their premises at Jacqueniotte&apos;s disposal tactics which will probably help suggestions that the &quot;Exploite &quot; groups should either remain or become members of the Parti Ouvrier and so have the &quot;Maisons du Peuple &quot; at their disposal. The authorities are now closely watching Jacquemotte&apos;s activities, especially in the mining districts, where the younger elements view with favour Jacqueinotte&apos;s policy of direct action and anti-militarism.The Industrial Crisis.The labour situation is, on the whole, calm, notwithstanding unem-ployment and discontent at proposed reductions of wages. Only a few small strikes are in progress.The increase in unemployment, which continues steadily, is specially marked at Antwerp, where some 40 per cent, of the dock labourers are idle daily. Efforts made in the smaller works to reduce wages have resulted in strikes or attempted occupation of the factories. Thus at Bisseghein, after a dispute over wage reduction, the employees occupied a hemp factory and worked until stopped by a breakdown of machinery. The works have now been vacated, and negotiations with the masters are proceeding satisfactorily. An attempt was made to occupy a linen factory at Ghent.
LUXEMBOURG.The Grand Ditchv is nl present seriously disturbed, aud is indeed the theatre of a miniature class war. The strike which started on March 1st as a movement of sympathy with tho discharge of workers from (lie iron and steel works at Differdange and Kodauge has, owing to the machinations of Conseils d&apos;Usine within the factories, become practically general, ami now embraces the 16,000 workers in the blast furnaces aud iron mining industry of the country. The neglect id&apos; the workmen has already caused summon damage to the black furnaces, Emulating Italian example, ou the second day of (ho strike the workers seized mines, workshops, and foundries, Their triumph was short, for French troops, called in by the Luxembourg Government, soon expelled the occupiers.More French troops are coining into Luxembourg, The railway workers are meanwhile considering whether or not to strike. The Belgian and French Ministers seem to have acted strongly, aiid the Luxembourg authorities are endeavouring to induce the strikers to consent to the abolition of the Coiiseils dTJsinc, which wore legally established last September. The strikers, however, are not disposed to agree.ITALY.Industrial Difficulties.The industrial crisis remains acute. The most serious of the con-tributing factors are probably the unfavourable exchange and the want of credit abroad. An improvement in the exchange might enable Italy to surmount her difficulties, but an improvement, though it is anticipated, can hardly be maintained without an English or American loan. The &quot;control&quot; of factories by the workmen has frightened away both Italian and foreign capital. Two French firms, for instance, stopped, the building of works of their own in North Italy, and cancelled largo orders of plant for the same reason. -Italian credit abroad has suffered, and purchases are no longer possible on the old terms.It is feared that many failures must occur this year. Bankers are-refusing credit even to firms of the highest repute. Labour circles are quiet, since the men now realise the critical conditions of Italian industries. There is a tendency, like that manifested nearer home, to represent that unemployment is deliberately produced, with a view of forcing down wages. At the Fiat works, at Turin, work has been reduced to 36 hours a week, to avoid wholesale discharges. It should be noted that the workers of the Fiat Company recently refused to execute a large order for machine guns from South America one of many things which are having a ruinous repercussion upon foreign opinion. The Micbelin Company at Turin is discharging another 900 workers in addition to the 900 already discharged. The high price and scarcity of coal are telling gravely against the engineering trade, and roost of the foundries arc closed down. Italy has also to face the competition of countries with worse exchanges than her own, aud independent of foreign sources for their raw material, such as Germany. German competition, the cost of raw materials, and the disinclination of the public to buy aggravate the crisis, which has a natural repercussion upon the position of the banks.On the land there is much unrest, which is likely to continue. The uneducated farm labourers are easily influenced by extremists.
Though it lias boon denied, some credibility seems to attach to tho statement that the Government intends to issue fresh paper money to help the engineering and steel trades in Italy.The Socialists have for some time controlled the Labour authorities of the port of Genoa, with the usual consequences. Mangini, head of the Coal Labourers&apos; Association and a member of the Labour Corn-mission of the Harbour Control, is the leader; Giuliclti, head of tho Seumen\s Federation, works in close co-operation with Mangini. The situation at Genoa is black, and revolutionary movements and a paralysis of Italian traffic may be expected. American propaganda is supported by vast sums of money, and competition between British and American companies is very keen. The Germans, who work through the Americans in Genoa, are very well received by the Italians.The Vatican and Sinn Fein.The Pope is reported to be determined, openly at any rate, to maintain his non-committal altitude on the Irish question, lie will neither make a pronouncement nor issue a manifesto, lint it is hinted that he might consent to intervene on the joint request of the British Government and of the Sinn Foiners. Cardinal Gasparri has refused to receive Gavan Dully. The Sinn Feiners in Home are despondent, and blame, among others, Cardinal Gasquel for the Popo&apos;s attitude.Secretly it is hinted that the Pope may be sympathetic with and may even be helping the Sinn Feiners. He is not likely, however, to protest openly against reprisals, in ease Groat Britain should withdraw her representative. It is believed that the Irish Republican Envoy to the Vatican is the &quot; Marquis &quot; Patrick McSweeney, and not Gavan Dully, who is merely a figurehead, though he describes himself as u Minister of tho Irish Republic in Italy.&quot; MeSwecney carries out propaganda. His unsavoury character is well known, but his ample means point the way to the recovery of his influence, with the Vatican, where he seems to be recovering his sway and has for friend Mgr. Tedeschini, the third most important personage in the Vatican administration. The Pope has reconfirmed McSweeney&apos;s title of Marquis of Machionaglass.With McSweeney&apos;s Sinn Fein intrigues are associated Monsignori Straniero and Tampieri, Fathers MacEwan and Conrey, the &quot;Marquis &quot; *de la Roche Francis and one Dallina, all of them characters unsavoury in various degrees. A pro-Irish and anti-British meeting has been held in Rome.Relations with Russia.It is reliably reported that the Italian Government does not see its way to accede to the Soviet Governments proposal that negotiations regarding a commercial treaty should lie pursued at Reval, through the Italian representative there. The Italian Government prefers that such discussions should be continued in London parallel with the negotiations for the English treaty. It is reported that the preference for London extends to the discussions of a clearing house at Milan and the transport of oil from Kuban.Moscow announces that an agreement has been granted to Vorowski&apos;s Mission. It is reported that Lezhava and Lenin supported the scheme for trade with Russia through tho Italian Co-operatives. All the exports of Ukrainia were to be secured for Italy through tho agreement made between Rakovsky and Rondani; Azerbaijan was to send petrol to Novorossisk for Italy, Italy supplying medical stores, agricultural machinery, locomotive parts, automobiles, and radio apparatus. However, as the S.S. &quot; Aucoua &quot; was seized on her outward voyage, not to speak
of the awkwardness at Naples on her return, and as other ships have been held up in Italy, little has so far been done,Communism.The Congress of the Teachers&apos; Syndicate, held at Modena in January, decided to join in tho first Congress of the Teachers&apos; International next August or September. Zanctta, who will represent Italy at the Congress, was authorised to propose that the Teachers&apos; International should become a section of the Third International,The &quot; Proletariat&apos; University &quot; at Milan has been inaugurated. It is reported to have over 4,000 members.   The secretary is Dino Bonardi.Extremists.Count Karolyi, the Hungarian ex-Prime Minister, and his family are to be expelled from Italy and sent to Czecho-Slovakia. Karolyi has lately been living nt Florence, and the Italian press insinuates that there is some connection between his presence there and the recent riots. Karolyi was frequently in touch with local Communists, and he is alleged to have given them money on several occasions. Countess Karolyi was a particularly ardent Bolshevik propagandist.Internal Troubles.The troubles between Fascist! and Communists continue to rage, In an affray at Florence at the end of February the local leader of the Communists was among the slain. As a protest a general strike was proclaimed at Florence. The day after the tragedy the fighting iu Florence became reminiscent of medireval days. The quarter of San Frediano rose in arms ; barricades were erected, which had to be stormed ; and the authorities barred the bridges over the Aruo with field guns. The latest news indicates that the effervescence has subsided.Miscellaneous.As was foreshadowed, the Socialists have been following a purely obstructive policy in the matter of the Bread Bill. The delay has meant a daily loss of 15,000,000 lire in supplying bread at less than half its cost. Ultimately, after certain small amendments, Giolitti called for a vote of confidence, which was carried by a majority of 151. The new formula puts the price of the big loaf for the workmen at 1 lira 20 per kilo., and the price of the small loaf for other parties at 1 lira 70. It is hoped that a uniform price may be introduced after two or three months. Meanwhile, to allow bread to be sold at the natural price without subsidy would mean a leap in price from the Government price to 4 lire.The steamer &quot; Ancona &quot; arrived at Naples from Novorossisk, in the Black Sea, with a cargo of potash and grain. The crew paint a terrible picture of decay, exhaustion, and death at Novorossisk. The town, the great exporting centre of grain, has no food. The Italian police have confiscated 160,000 roubles&apos;worth of gold in the cabin of one of the Russian Bolsheviks on board the &quot; Ancona,&quot; which Avas closely watched until she departed for London. The Bolsheviks are said to have acquired another steamer, the &quot; Garibaldi,&quot; in order to,maintain regular communication between Naples and the Black Sea ports.Djavid Bey has been officially accredited to Rome as the permanent representative of the Angora Government,The Colonial Institute is patronising a &quot; Society of Eastern Friends,&quot; which is being formed in Rome. The Society has for object to open a club for Easterners iu Rome, and to afford facilities to Oriental students.   Its members include the most prominent Italian Orientalists.
It would seem that the headquarters of the Society are more than likely to he a meeting place for Oriental intriguers.SPAIN.Syndicalism would appear to have been scotched, hut by no means killed. Rivival is likely. The Reds have begun to retaliate with some effect on the Sindicato Libre, and appear to be fairly successful in the collection of subscriptions. Attempts are being made to form separate Trades Unions in place of the Sindicato Unico,The round-up of syndicalists continues throughout Spain. A great seizure of Red literature at Barcelona is reported. The struggle in Barcelona continues, and the authorities show no signs of weakening. The repressive measures, which aim at asserting the freedom of the individual labourer, would appear to lie justified. The authorities are fighting a small but powerful body of Extremists, most of whom are simply unscrupulous opportunists.The murder of the Premier, Sefior Dato, on the night of March Nth, is believed to have been an act of Syndicalist vengeance. The opinion is that the murderers came from Barcelona and that the plot was batched there. The Premier had been warned that a plot was being engineered against him. The murder was committed by three men on a motor-cycle and a side-car, who fired gome 20 shots at the Premiers automobile. There is evidence that the crime was rehearsed a few days before it was perpetrated.The attempt of the National Confederation of Labour, opposed by many Syndicalists, to persuade other countries to boycott Spanish goods failed. Only Italy and Portugal replied. The Unione Sindicalo Italiano sent 0,000 pesetas as aid to prisoners.The Confederation has issued a manifesto, which points out tho inequalities of pay among the working classes, and lays stress on the need of greater education, It advises sabotage instead of strikes, which frequently bring more loss than gain to workmen.The mischief-maker, John Arnall, appears to have been imprisoned some months ago by the Spaniards in Algeciras, for neglect of passport regulations. Arnall represents Colonel J. Ward, M.P., who directs a company in the Rill&apos;for bringing wood by sea to Tangier.PORTUGAL.The newspaper strike still continues, and the public is forced to rely for news upon very meagre broadsheets. The &quot; Balalha,&quot; however, still continues in full blast. In addition to the &quot;Batalha&quot; two other broad-sheets are appearing, one run for tho owners by soldiers supplied by the Government, and the other run by the strikers themselves. The C.G.T. is using the opportunity to stir up further strikes. They are attempting to cause trouble in the railway, post office, telegraph, bank, and telephone services, without success so far, although the spirit of ca&apos; canny is abroad in telephones and railways.Sr. Peres Trancoso, a naval officer who lias spent most of his time ashore, is the new food controller, and seems, so far, to have succeeded in encouraging various necessary articles to disappear from the market by fixing maximum prices which leave no profit to the producer. Sensible food control is urgently needed, since prices have risen from 530 per cent, in the case of beef to 1,060 per cent, in the case of sugar. Food control regulations on English models are, however, likely to defeat
themselves, and to prepare the ground for Bolshevik seed, which is not for the moment being sown.A war profiteer named Sergio Principe, who was once a Syndicalist, but who has changed his views with riches, is the organiser of an anti-Syndicalist Secret Society called the Congresso Patronal, which is being formed with Government sanction on the lines of the Somatem in Spain.2. SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES. NORWAY.The Communist Ferment.In reviewing the Labour and Extremist movements in Norway during 1920, it may be remarked that the year established a record for intensity of organisation and agitation. The revolutionary movement is to be further speeded up during 1921.Moscow would appear to be carefully and surreptitiously welding the Communists and Syndicalists of Scandinavia. It is reported that anarchist intrigues are undoubtedly going on, directed towards the fusion of extreme syndicalists, communists of anarchist leanings, and anarchists. In Norway some extreme young socialists, seduced by Trygve Aakervik&apos;s personality, have joined the anarchist group. The fusing movement has been fairly successful in Denmark and Sweden.Communists are said to be talking of a new and sudden railway strike, and of a revolutionary general strike at the end of the spring. Even among some sober workers an inclination towards communist anarchism is noticeable. Unemployment, prospects of wage reductions, and the disappointment of the Extremists at their failures are other factors making for unrest. Nevertheless, recent reverses have put Norwegian extremists under a cloud, while encouraging the authorities, aud the Moderate Socialists, Puntervold, leader of (he moderate Socialists, and Olc Lian, a leader of the Socialist Right Wing, are said to lie considering prospects of joining forces. It may, however, be doubted whether Communism has suffered very greatly. The fanatics are working busily beneath the surface ; private revolutionary clubs and cliques are being formed, and the penetration of agricultural labour by &quot;germ-cell &quot; units and the struggle to substitute Communist Trade Guilds for thenoTrade Unions continues. The rapprochement reported between the National Labour Party and the Prohibitionists has for object to force upon Norway intercourse with Russia.The Social Democratic opposition has now resolved itself into an independent party known as Norway&apos;s Social Democratic Labour Party, which seeks to include all. social democrats who oppose the dictatorship pf the Third International. &quot; Arbeider-Politikkcn &quot; is the central organ of the party.Generally speaking, extremist influence is slight at Christiania, and Bolshevism does not appear to be spreading. There has been no propa-ganda at Fredriksstad, where the editor of the Socialist newspaper is firmly anti-Communist, and has so far defeated attempts to displace him.It is reported, however, that the Communist, Young Socialists are reported to have founded five industrial and trade union groups at Christiania, intended to bo the big &quot; germ-cells&quot; of the Communist Trade Unions in Norway. When Arvid Hanson met Kabakchieff, the Central Soviet emissary, at tho Leghorn Conference in January they discussed inter-European communist action, and a now system of couriers and distribution of messages and propaganda, pamphlets to various countries via Norway.
The Activities of Folkets Hus.The Storting has debated tho import of Russian literature into England by way of Norway. Some members argued that the Order in Council issued by tho Norwegian Government was illegal ; the Prime Minister defended it as a measure to prevent Norwegian interests, ships, and seamen from being injured by the hawking of literature by the Bolsheviks of Folkets llus for their Russian leaders. The debate was adjourned. The Christiania students have passed a resolution protesting against the Governments action in banning Russian literature as au interference with the liberty of the subject.Folkets llus has, it is said, been informed that at the pan-British Workers&apos; Congress John McLean, the &quot;Bolshevik Consul&quot; in Glasgow, will propose direct action to enforce the resumption of unrestricted inter-course with Russia. Some mystery attaches to the hitherto unknown &quot;International Union of Unemployed,&quot; believed to be in process of formation, to which Folkets llus is accessory. McLean appears to be interested in this organisation, probably with a view to founding branches in tho United Kingdom.The need of borrowing from the Folkets Hus fund is reported to be very great. In 1919, 1(3 petitions, totalling 75,000 kr., were dealt with ; seven petitions, for a total of 10,000 kr., have been accepted for further inquiry. In 1919 subscriptions amounted to 27,310.96 kr., payments in interest and rebates to 13,180.59 kr., and outstanding loans to 92,895.00 kr.The Soldiers&apos; Council.The National Conference of the Soldiers&apos; Council, held at the end of January, defined the task of the Council as in the first place to prevent the military forces being used against the workers, and to co-operate with the trade unions and political organisations in an effective light against militarism and for disarmament. The Conference demanded the right for soldiers and sailors to organise themselves in a service men&apos;s council, the abolition of political censorship during the training period, support, if necessary, from outside organisations, and a recognition and influence in military matters similar to that which trade unions possess, and which workshop councils are obtaining. Civilians are to be interested, and propaganda is to be carried out through the establishment of anti-militarist committees as far as possible in every town and rural division. Soldiers&apos; Councils and tho anti-militarist committees will form between them the National Federation of Soldiers&apos; Councils,,SWEDEN.Labour and Economic.The reduction of wages, general all over the country, is causing great dissatisfaction among the working classes. Many workers are striking or being dismissed. The steady determination of the public to buy only absolute necessities has caused the prices of clothing, &amp;c, to drop at a remarkable rate, so that firms must sell at a heavy loss. The prices of food, &amp;c, are more or less stationary. Business circles&apos; think it more than probable that many large Stockholm firms will fail this spring.The Swedish Ship Engineers&apos; Union has struck after the refusal of tho Shipowners&apos; Association to advance pay from 550 kroner to 850 kroner a month. The full effects of tlio strike, which is viewed with natural satisfaction in Germany, are not likely to be felt for some months. There is a rumour that naval engineers have been asked to blackleg, but have so far refused.
Communism and Socialism.No organisation of youth in Sweden accepts the Third International or is affiliated to the &quot; International Communist Juvenile Movement.&quot; The Young Socialist Party, whioh consists chiefly of young men under 35, is reported to have a present membership of 18,000 ; between 5,000 and 6,000 of them in Stockholm. One Hinke Bergegrau, uoiv a prominent Bolshevik, was the founder and one-time leader of the party. The actual president is Bjorklund, an editor. Headquarters are ill Stockholm. The Young Socialists believe ill Communism, but they reject the Third International and dictatorship by leaders. The Party has affiliated groups all over the country, and runs juvenile clubs. The Left Socialist Party is now issuing for its Juvenile Association a children&apos;s newspaper called &quot; Solglint,&quot; edited by Nils Flyg. A number of Young Socialists, in obedience to a command to undertake house-to-house canvassing, recently entered the Dragoon Barracks, offering copies of their literature. They were, however, set upon by the soldiers, stripped, flogged, and handed over to the police.J. S. von Gogerfelt, editor of the &quot; Poliliken,&quot;&apos; has been prosecuted for publishing a secret order regarding military service. The order would appear to be issued annually, but the &quot; Politiken &quot; insinuates that in this particular case it was meant as a preparation against a railway strike, and threatens to publish any secret orders for military service which it may obtain.Relations with Russia.Kerjentseff has arrived in Stockholm as accredited representative of the Soviet Government. The Bolsheviks, after consenting to a Swedish economic delegation entering Russia, subject to approval of delegates by the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, finally, on the outbreaks of revolt in Petrograd and Moscow, postponed the delegation^ admission. The Swedish Foreign Minister thereupon informed Tchiteherin that his persis-. fence in this attitude would lead to the withdrawal of the permission granted to the Russian delegates to come to Sweden. Theodore Rothstein, who was first proposed as the Soviet Governments representative, was not accepted by the Swedish Government. Kerjentseff is another of the same kidney, whose acceptance by the Swedish Government is a victory for Russian fomenters of troubles abroad.The authorities are disquieted by the activities of the Rosta, as to whose propaganda they have received secret representations from the Danish and Norwegian Governments. Vasili Smirnof, the manager of the Rosta in Stockholm, has been informed that a continuation of his activities will entail expulsion.Early in January everything was reported to be ready for the resumption of telegraphic communications between Russia and Sweden. It is reported that Soviet Russia has refused the request of the Central Communist Committee in Sweden for financial support during the next two years.The Asea Company and tho Soviet representative in Stockholm have so far been unable to reach an agreement. The company refuses to work in Russia unless a certain sum in gold is advanced and deposited in a Swedish bank as security.&apos;   Russian Gold.It is reported that Juon, the representative of the Department for Foreign Trade and of the Centrosoyns, bears the responsibility ofO AS 8718 B
deciding bow much gold is to he sent into Sweden from Russia, ami, lor the present, the extern of purchases to be made in Scandinavia ami Finland, The Swedish banks are, however, said to lie great rivals for dealing in gold. The Knskildn Bank has become the official Bolshevik hank. The role of Onlentlich is secondary. Lomouosoft&quot; has ordered Aschberg and Ordentlich to boycott the French and especially to refuse to still them gold. Averbaeh has bought 3,000 Ions of cellulose besides the thousand tons of paper which he bought in Stockholm.JtionV delegation would appear to have received information from various sources that the American bauks are much interested in Russian gold an interest due to the fact that Russian gold will shortly share the advantages o! the free market in the United States. The Bolsheviks&apos; agents have raised the selling juice of the gold rouble from 2 kroner 7 re to 2 kroner 17 re.A communication from the Svenska lOkonomiuktiohohiget of Sioek-hohn to Klisbko in London states that they have received on Klishko&apos;s account from Solomon, the president of the Russian Trada Delegation in Reval, it parcel of gold consisting of 30 eases, said to contain 1,944,000 roubles in gold coins, The amount referred to was probably part of the 66 eases of Bolshevik gold reported 10 have been landed at Stockholm from the Reval steamer &quot; Egil,&quot; most of the consignment going to Stockholm banks.The Swedish banks, not caring to collect much Soviet gold, are reported to be selling it to Switzerland and Holland. Some said to he used for paying debts to America, has been taken over by the Banque de France. Soviet gold passes to Sweden in the course of transit, but not much of it seems to remain there.The captain of the S.S. &quot; Knlevipoeg,&quot; which has already been mentioned in connection with the transport of gold to Sweden, is suspected of being an accomplice of a certain Weber in the passing of paper roubles from Reval to Stockholm. Use is made sometimes of small, fast motor boats, which draw little water, and thus can travel safely over the mine-fields. At Stockholm the roubles are said to find their way to one Olssen, director of the &quot; Aktiebolaget Affarsbyran,&quot; who tries to find captains of boats willing to take the roubles to England and France.DENMARK.Russian Intrigue.Late in December the Danish Government intimated to Krassin that it would permit an economic delegation to visit Denmark to negotiate on trade relations on condition that no propaganda was carried on or supported, that no relations are entertained with the Danish Communist Party, and that the members of the delegation are not officers or commissaries of the Red Army and do not undertake any military mission in Denmark. Krassiu made some show of doubt as to whether these conditions would be accepted.The Blind and the Syndicalists in Copenhagen are said to have received confidential notes from Vienna and Berlin asking them to prepare lists of journalists and private persons believed to be working against Bolshevism, a list of reactionary elements in Scandinavia, and a list of Social Democratic parties, particularly of those members who are for or against Soviet Russia.Copenhagen Clearing House.The Russian Commissariat for Foreign Trade and their trade dele-gation abroad are at loggerheads with the Clearing House at Copenhagen,
which has boon refusing to renew their bills, and suggesting that their gold should be realised at inferior rates. In order to avoid this calamity the Bolsheviks entered into negotiations with ihe French for the sale of tho gold.Labour.Competition with foreign countries is said to be impossible, owing to high wages, abnormal exchanges, and unfavourable customs regulations. Lock-out notices in the iron and brick trades have followed the recent lock-out in the textile and boot industries. Almost -10,000 workers, including 25,000 in the iron industry, are affected. The employers are, however, willing to resume negotiations. Since October 31st the iron industry shows a reduction of 17* 1 per cent, in operatives and 23 per cent, in working hours. Repairing work in the factories is still com-pnrativoly good.Tho textile trade is at present producing only 25 per cent, of the normal, and may have to stop altogether, The textile workers have rejected the suggestion of the Employers&apos; Association that wages should bo reduced by from 17 per cent, to 25 per cent., with a proportionate reduction for extra work, the reduction to operate for three months. The workers want a continuation of the old agreement for one year, wages to vary according to the cost of living.Extremists and Labour Organisations.The Danish Workmen&apos;s Trade Union, called &quot; The Workmen^ Union of Trade Unions&quot; (D.S.F., &quot; De Samvirkende Fagforbund &quot;), is led by opportunists, and is opposed by a syndicalist organisation which has formed, in every trade, clubs calling themselves &quot; Unions of Opposition against Trades Unions&quot; (&quot; Fagoppositionens Sammenslu-tring&quot;). These publish a paper called &quot; Solidaritot.&quot; A strong organisation of employers also exists.The &quot; Help Committee for Jews rendered destitute by the War&quot; has ollicos in Copenhagen and, for one member, Dr. Brender, reported to be a propagandist, authorised to issue Bolshevik passports, and interested in Danish syndicalism.There is au unconfirmed report that a small communist section is being formed amongst school teachers.3. CENTRAL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HOLLAND.Communism.Communist attempts to stir up the unemployed are reported to be very unsuccessful. Only three or four men appeared the other day outside the Amsterdam Town Hall in answer to a Communist appeal that the unemployed should demonstrate while the Council discussed unemployment.Lebedjef has insisted to a gathering of Intellectual Bolsheviks on the necessity of the Dutch Proletariat training propagandists. This was the duty of the Dutch Intellectuals, to whom, in tho name of Krassin, ho announced that money would be given for propaganda among the Intelligentsia.Very little correspondence is said to be in progress at present between the Communist Party in Holland and Moscow.   Germany is still the 0 A3 8718 0
weak point for Holland, Communist activities are hampered by the difficulties which known leaders find in travelling, and these difficulties will last as long as the present system of passport control continues, This is emphasised by the recent experiences of various Dutch Communists.The Industrial Crisis.Iu order to relieve the distress caused by unemployment, tho Minister of Labour is arranging to assist municipal councils to undertake various approved works, and to provide funds.The Deventer Town Council, besides using as many unemployed as possible on public works, has arranged with the Trade Unions to start an emergency technical school for teaching various trades.The Chamber of Commerce and Industry at Deventer has asked the authorities to suspend or postpone the 15-hours week, on the ground that it fatally handicaps industry iu competition with other countries, and that production can only he increased by an increase of working hours.Pacifism.At a Conference of the Dutch Section of tho International Anti-Militarist Union the League of Nations was criticised as ineffective, and its Vilna contingent as the nucleus of an international anti-Russian army. Co-operation with the English &quot; No-Conscription Fellowship &quot; aud with the &quot; 2\ &quot; International has been discussed ; aud many new connections have been made with pacifists and communists abroad.It appears that the more extreme delegates those opposed to any war, international or civil to the International Anti-Militarist Congress which is to take place at The Hague at the end of March, will be invited to a preliminary gathering of their own at Bilthove, near Utrecht, &quot; face,&quot; the Esperantist word for peace, is suggested as the name of the new League.Communism in the Dutch East Indies.Samarang would appear to bo the headquarters of such Communism as exists in the Dutch East Indies. Here Sneevliet, since deported, and Baars, now an engineer for the Samarang municipality, exercised their activities. But there appears to be little evidence of connection between political movements in the islands and Russian Bolshevism. Direct Bolshevik activities have so far been the work of Chinese. The Khalifat agitation, reported never to have been serious, seems now to be dead.Sinn Fein.By 64 votes to 2, the States General refused to permit an interpella-tion by van Ravesteyu, a Communist member, regarding the recognition of the &quot; Irish Republic &quot; by the Dutch Government. Van Ravesteyn&apos;s argument traversed familiar ground, aud contended speciously that the Government had the right to submit the matter to tho League of Nations. The President of the Chamber contended that an Irish Republic was unknown to him, and that there was no actual basis for the interpellation.
GERMANY.The Soviet Representative.When Moscow appointed its foreign representatives a year ago, they were carefully chosen, and charged to work with tact and discretion. They worked well under most discouraging conditions, hut the growth of Left influence in Moscow brought about a corresponding change iu the SovieVs attitude towards its representatives. Kopp was appointed to Berlin in February 1920 to represent the Soviet in all matters concerning the repatriation of Russian prisoners of war. He was first instructed to organise an intelligence service amongst foreign representatives in Berlin, as well as in German offices. This work was delegated to Reich, and then taken out of his hands. Meanwhile Moscow was criticising Kopp&apos;s work, and representatives of the co-operative societies were sent to reorganise the Berlin Mission, This delegation was expelled ; Kopp and Reich appear to have escaped recall only through the influence of Lomonosoff. Kopp&apos;s effective work among the 60,000 Russians interned during the Polish campaign stabilised Ids position, which was further improved by tho result of the Halle Conference. His activities were, however, diminished. Propaganda passed to the Russian section of the Communist Party, and Kopp&apos;s mission was confiued to commercial questions. Kopp&apos;s attempts to obtain concessions or to form a trading syndicate progressively and completely failed. Krassin&apos;s recent arrival iu Berlin on his way to Moscow coincided with the end of Kopp&apos;s negotiations. Berlin in any case now becomes a sub-bureau of the &apos;1 Embassy &quot; at Reval, and Kopp, if he survives the change, will do so as the Charge d&apos;Affaires under Litvinoff. It is significant that on Krassims return he conducted all business transactions with Krupp, &amp;c, himself.Moscow and the German Communist Party (K.P.D.).The situation as between tho Moscow Executive and the German Communist Party is reported to show great differences of opinion analogous to those between the Leuin-Zinovieff faction aud the Trotsky-Bucharin faction in Russia.* An outstanding difficulty is that of the admission to the Third International of the German Communist Labour Party (K.A.P.D.). Here Lenin would appear to be subordinate to the extremists. On this question the Berlin Zentraleis against the K.A.P.D., but it recognises the exclusive competence of the Moscow executive, Avhich it calls upon to proceed against the K.A.P.O., on account of the latter&apos;s agitation. The Zentrale desired a strengthening of American and Western European influence on the International, and therefore demands a fundamental change iu composition of the Executive Committee The number of representatives of the various communist parties to the Executive must be increased ; four delegates of the Executive (only two* See also special article on this subject in Part If. of this issue.0 8
of them Russians) should lie sent to Western Europe and America, charged with bringing the condition of foreign parties before the Moscow executive, and a special Communist newspaper correspondence must be issued in Western Europe in addition to tho Moscow &quot; Kommunistisehe Internationale.&quot; The K.P.D. also opposes the admission of the &quot; Alleeemeiner Arbeiter-Union &quot; and of the Syndicalist *&apos;Frei Arbeitcr Union &quot; to the Red Trades Unions International because it is embarrassed by the latter in its lights against the Amsterdam Trades Unions Inter-national, which can itself point to the Moscow Trades Unions International as Syndicalist. Syndicalism is no longer very popular in Germany. Ou this point there is much conflict between the Marxian-Centralists and the upholders of Syndicalism. Trotsky wishes to make the Unions a State apparatus, Lenin to keep them separate from the State. The latest report indicates an agreement between Lenin and Trotsky, but the matter will be officially discussed next month. Appearances and the recent vote in the Executive Committee of the Party point to a Leninist victory.In order, it is said, to demonstrate its dissatisfaction with the K.P.D. Moscow has admitted a delegate of the K.A.P.D. as a &quot; sympathising &quot; member of the Third International, who is to have a deliberative vote in the executive of the International. The leaders of the K.P.I). have sent a strong protest to Moscow against this approach to their rivals and to the Syndicalist German elements. Moscow particularly disapproves of the policy of the leader of the K.P.D., Paul Levi, who is now frequently called a &quot; Salon-Sozialist.&quot; On the other hand, Willi. Schroeder, the leader of tho K.A.P.D.. has recently left for Moscow at the invitation of the executive committee of the Third International. Towards the end of the month, Levi, Daeumig, Adolf Hoffmann, and Klara Zetkin withdrew from the Executive Committee of the United Communist Party. The Communist Workers&apos; Party intends to submit to the Moscow executive a motion for the exclusion of the new United Communist Party from the International, as being an electoral swindle.Communists and Extremists.The Governments rumoured notification to the Dutch Government of its fears of a. Communist rising in the spring is reported to have been made for the benefit of the Entente, in order to impress them with Germany&apos;s need for a strong armed force. Kopp is reported to have been pessimistic in a recent report to Moscow. He talks of the inert and bourgeois mentality of the German proletariat, the majority of which is against anything like revolution. The Soviet policy should be one of co-ordination with the moderate parties. The German Nationalists should bo won as the Turkish Nationalists have been won.The opinion has been expressed that there is little fear of a red out-break in Germany, except in case of a successful Russian offensive against Poland. German workmen, especially in Southern and Central Germany, have latterly become much steadier, and have discovered that, the road to prosperity lies through joint work with the capitalist. The Communist Party is, however, well organised and widely spread, and an outbreak would be more serious than a year ago, owing to superior international organisation.A report from a German source, which may bo intended for propaganda, mentions that the Red Army in the Rhineland and Westphalia, recruited
principally from the United Communist Party, consists of from 25,000 to 30,000 men, under strict discipline and organisation. The Army is not, however, on the footing mentioned, but is a skeleton more or less composed of leaders, who are charged with assembling their followers on command, There is talk of establishing war schools in the Rhenish-Westphalian industrial area, and of inviting German, Austrian, and Russian officers to give lessons. The whole army would appear to he on a well-considered military basis, and arms and munitions to be available in large quantities, Local surprise attacks would seem to be the general plan of campaign, and special care to be given to the espionage system and to establishing a terror.The farm workers and discontented small owners in East Prussia arc said to be forming armed protection corps against the reactionary forces. They want the establishment of agrarian councils, tho confiscation of big estates and distribution to the workers, a co-operation federation of the farms, and an alliance with the Russian Co-operatives. The German Government is alive to the danger, and will meet it with force if necessary.Only in tho Hamburg and Hallo districts, in VViirttemberg, and in Silesia has the old Independent Socialist membership been completely transferred to the new Communist Party. Elsewhere the Right Inde-coorespondents retain the party apparatus, tho party press, and the membership. The new Communists number some 428,000 (50,000 in Berlin and 40,000 in Hamburg) ; the old Communists some 160,000 a total for the new party of under 600,000 members.Fedor Schacht, President of the Moscow German Soldiers&apos; Soviet, is reported to have arrived some time ago in Berlin, and to have become head of a secret bureau directing the coining strike of the employees of the German municipal railways. Kopp, however, seems to have refused further funds on the ground that expenses already exceod the money at his disposal. Meanwhile it is reported that Krassin took with him to Russia all Schachfs plans and estimates for organising a general railway strike in Germany.Relations with Russia.According to the Rosta Agency, Kopp left Moscow for Berlin ou February 14th.The successor of Eiduk in Germany is Smirnoff, member of tho Moscow Extraordinary Commission, who will superintend a special department of the Russian section. Eiduk owes his supersession to his tactlessness and to the dissensions between him and the Soviet Mission in Berlin. Dzerjinsky, head of the Moscow Extraordinary Commission, was also in Berlin early in January. He came privately to undergo an operation, and his visit had no connection with political changes.It is reported that many interned Bolshevik Commissars have, at the request of Kopp, been authorised to live in Berlin, where they appear in Red Army uniform with Red decorations and signs. They openly gather information about anti-Bolshevist Russians in Berlin.Kopp is said to have engaged the services of a private detective bureau, &quot; Nabert,&quot; and an export and import office, F. Schmidt, Lin ion Strasse No. 130,   A certain Peters, formerly assistant to Dzerjinsky,
is said to be engaged, together with the representative of the Kiew Special Executive Commission, Krauze, a future Special Executive Com-missiouer in Germany, on preparing proscription lists after the high Roman fashion. One Jablonsky, agent of the French Intelligence, who generally lives in Kovno, assists him.Von Maltzahn was in Stockholm early in January discussing with Krassin general relations, tho establishment of consulates hi Russia and the Ukraine, the working out of the scheme by which Germany is to send specialists to Russia, and the orders for locomotives which have been placed in Germany. Dr. Steller has been sent to Moscow to supervise the transport of prisoners of war and to study the economic situation.Stinnes&apos; Activities.It is believed possible that Hugo Slinnes may shortly put about an announcement that he has nothing to do with, and has never met any representative of, the Soviet Government.His oflice in Berlin, however, has a special department for dealing with Russian business, and the big combines of Siemens Sehuckert, the Allgemeinc Elektrizitaets Gesellschaft, the Steel Trust, &amp;c, are under his control. These concerns have already accepted large orders from Lomouosoff and Kopp in Berlin, and are fulfilling them. Several steamer loads of goods were sent from Germany to Russia by them at the beginning of March, and provisional contracts for dynamos and other machinery had been arranged. Fixed contracts for 1^ million lamps and other electrical fixtures and machinery are in process of execution.Towards the end of February representatives of Stinnes were at Reval, laying before the Soviet representative there proposals for the repair of locomotives in Esthonia and Latvia and of sea-going vessels in German ports through the agency of Krupp and Stinnes.Lomonosoff, the local Soviet commercial agent, gave his blessing to the project, and Moscow had so far assented that it had agreed to receive Stinnes&apos; representatives. Moscow displayed some anxiety regarding the danger which the plan involved to tho Armstrong deal, to which, for political reasons and until the trade agreement with England bad been reached, it still attached importance, herr Stinnes is apparently trying to hide his tracks. His staff&apos; seem to have received instructions to make as little as possible of his control of newspapers and his interest in hotels. In both directions, however, lie continues to spread. He is said to bo trying to buy the &quot; Wiener Mittagpost&quot; and to have intentions upon the Budapest &quot;Pesti Hirlap &quot; and a newspaper in Prague. He also means to get an interest in the Danube Navigation Company. A steamship company under his control six months ago bought the Atlantic, Esplanade, Bristol, Adlon, and different hotels in Berlin. The purposes and attitude of Stinnes have especial importance at present in view of his close business connections with and identity of policy with M. Krassin.*It appears probable that the German Government, indirectly through big commercial organisations like those of Stinnes&apos;, are engaging the co-operation of the Bolsheviks in breaking the Versailles Treaty, while &quot;opportunist&quot; Bolsheviks, through the same channels, are trying to* On this subject, see also Russia in this issue, page 31.
achieve the welding together of the two countries, which is the aim of their policy. The militant Bolsheviks, meanwhile, hope by some such connection to be in a favourable position to extend their propaganda and make a Spartaeist Germany. Both parties are gambling. It is believed in circles in intimate touch with &quot;opportunist&quot; Bolsheviks that if Krassin has returned to England with renewed authority and power, it is mainly because in Moscow he has come to a superficial agreement with Trotsky in the matter of a liusso-German combination.Reliable reports indicating the bellicose attitude of M. Krassin since his return to London appear to confirm this view.Social and Political.The attitude of the masses towards the Government is reported to be one of absolute indifference. Tins wealthy classes are putting out their money all over the World, and will continue to do so if the exchange improves. Generally speaking, the political, military, and reactionary elements are seeking an agreement with America; the non-military, commercial, industrial, aud financial classes an agreement with England, which is advocated largely in the interests of the reconstruction of Russia. It is considered that the difficulties in the way of accepting Russian gold might be overcome by amalgamation with English firms. For fear of France the Germans are afraid to accept Russian gold, and to increase their activities and export openly, lest France may claim this gold. Semi-official negotiations have been started. The directors of Krupps have met Vickcrs&apos; representative in Essen, who has been scmi-officially negotiating a combination for organising a special company for Russian business, and a combination in which all orders for Russian railroads should be taken by Vickers and a part of them sub-contracted to Krupps. The mass of the people, as well as leading politicians, are reported to appreciate the behaviour of English diplomatic and consular officials, and the attitude of the occupation authorities and troops. A strong anti-French feeling is reported in the Bavarian People&apos;s Party. Munich society circles are boycotting M. Dard, who is losing all influence. Members of the Left in Munich are apparently reckoning with the early break up of the Von Kahr Cabinet. The Cabinet is threatened by the dissensions between the Christian Trades Unions and the Right Wing of the Bavarian Peoplc&apos;s Party, which is chiefly concerned with protecting farming interests. The Cabinet has also been deeply committed over the Einwohnerwehr question, but it is hardly likely to resign on that alone. The possibility exists of a Coalition Cabinet formed from the Bavarian People&apos;s Party, tho Democrats, aud the Majority Socialists, but there are serious difficulties in the way of such a block. The entry of the Majority Socialists into the Government would improve the strained relations between Bavaria and the Reich, which daily become Avorse.At a meeting presided over by Max Taube, Chairman of the &quot; Vaterlaendischer Volksbund,&quot; the Prussian Monarchist Party has been founded. The party is independent of all political parties, and does not commit itself to any particular candidate for the Prussian throne, presuming, however, that only a Ilohenzollern could be eligible. Hero it clashes Avith the &quot;League of the Upright,&quot; which demands uncoiidi-tionally the ex-Crown Prince. The &quot; League of the Upright&quot; is exclusive ; the neAV party embraces all parties, and is most successful among the small officials. The new party is, hoAvever, not being very heartily Avelcomed, and other parties incline to argue that the new organisation is superfluous.
The Government is said to intend appointing &quot; Social Attaches&quot; to the various diplomatic missions abroad. These attaches will havo tho duty of ingratiating themselves with society generally and, what is considered more important, winning the friendship of Labour leaders and trade organisations.Oriental Intrigue.Arranged apparently by Chattopadya and the Russian Soviet government, a representative conference of Indians has been hold in Berlin. The Conference deluded to organise and openly start in Berlin a society called the &quot;Indian Revolutionary Society,&quot; including both Communists and Nationalists, and uniting the parties working all over the world for the emancipation of India. Tho members of the Executive Committee, who are secretly to bind themselves to Communism, will be divided into political, propagandist, and commercial groups, the com-mercial group not openly associating with the others. The head of the political section is always to be in close touch with the Russian Soviet. The German Foreign Office is to be asked not to obstruct the scheme at tho dictation of England, and the Committee will guarantee, in spite of its alliance with the Soviet, not to attempt interference with tlie internal affairs of Germany or of the other European countries in which they are working. Should Berlin refuse the guarantee, tho Committee will ceaso to havo any centre in Germany or any relations with it. Chatto and others are meanwhile to visit Russia to report to the Soviet, who will finance the Society, and to hold a further meeting discussing the scheme. On the commercial side there would appear to be a scheme to form a limited company called the Indo-European Trading Company, Ltd., for which C. E. Dunz, of Zurich, is to put up 200,000 frs. as half the capital. The Indians will put up the other half of the capital (obtained from tho Soviet government) and will take two-thirds of the profits. The activities of Dunz will be purely commercial. Chatto has already started a business in Stockholm. Das Gupta has broken with Schemmel, and the Indo-European Trading Company is evidently meant to take the place of Schennnel and Company.Virendrauath Chattopadya, the most active member of the Indian Committee in Berlin, has returned to Berliu from Moscow, after obtaining a promise of help from the Soviet Government. Tho Soviet, however, insists on proof that Chatto represents the Indian Revolutionary and Communist parties in the form of a mandate signed by responsible Indians. Chatto has no such mandate, and he is at present devoting bis energies to obtaining it. He has been discussing revolutionary and Communist tactics with various Indians, and has now met all the Indians in Berlin, as well as tho leaders of the Egyptian, Persian, and Turkish Committees. Chatto has reopened the old office of the Berlin India Committee. Heramba Gupta has been appointed secretary of the office, and Bhupeudra Nath Dutta general secretary for Europe of the India Committee. The committee is now aiming at spreading Communism throughout India, and at organising regular communications with the Indian leaders. They hope to send trained Communists to India as propagandists, and to smuggle Communist literature, in English or Indian languages, into India, through English Socialists or unsuspected Indian students in London. Since it is considered unsafe to send trained Indians back to India, it is suggested that Europeans should be used. Men are also to be invited to Europe to learn Communism. These must come as traders, and go only to Italy or France to avoid suspicion.   Secret centres are to bo opened in those countries.   Chatto
is still considering these plans, and has not yet allotted their various duties to his assistants.Accompanied by several Mohammedan Indians, among them Hassad Ogli, an Eastern Bolshevik, Radek has visited Berlin incognito, and has conferred with the heads of the Oriental Club. From Berlin he went to Vienna to confer with Bronski.Speaking recently in Berlin, II. Gilford suggested that some Indian youths should be sent to America for training by Irish experts. They should then he sent back to India, to work in co-operation and simultaneously with the Irish. Colonel Emerson has remarked that it is no use buying arms and ammunition until the whole mass is prepared for revolution. Ho believes that the mass of the Indian people is not yet well organised.Enver Pasha was in Berlin late in January, but has since gone to Moseow. Talaat had then returned from Switzerland and Home, and, having discovered that Turkish Nationalists in Switzerland and Italy deprecate further co-operation with Moscow, was reported to bo more Anglophile,A club, called the &quot; Oriental Club,&quot; has boon recently founded in Motzstrnssc, Berlin. It was financed by Talaat Pasha ; Pillai is vicc-presidont and general secretary, and most of the members are Egyptians, Orientals of all races moot there, but the club would seem to ho without much importance, except that the political leaders go there.Orgesch and Einwohnerwehr.It was reported in January that at a recent conference at Munich the leaders of the Orgesch and the Einwolinerwelir decided to lay up safely all plans, lists of members, &amp;c, to instruct all leaders, officers, and non-commissioned officers to stand at their posts and await orders, to hide all arms and munitions in case of an eventual disarmament, and to revive the two organisations after a certain period, should the Entente decide to dissolve them.In some quarters,1 about the same date, the Einwohnerwehr was considered to be too military in its present form and to have more arms than it required. The organisation lias, in fact, largely escaped from the control of its leader. It was suggested that the Einwohnerwehr might be replaced by something in the nature of i Ieiinatschutz Associations as propaganda against Communist outbreaks.Miscellaneous.The &quot; Echo dc Paris &quot; contends that there is no new unemployment crisis in Germany. Actually 409,000 unemployed, mainly belonging to the textile and leather industries, are being maintained by the State. Since the war the number of unemployed has always been between 800,000 and 1,000,000. This is a permanent problem, as a solution of which the Reichstag recommends the repopulation of the countryside.A general exodus of German workers and colonists from Russia is reported, and the Government has arranged special camps to receive returning Germans. The exodus will be facilitated by the signing of the Russo-Polish Treaty. Meanwhile the German settlements in the Caucasus are reported to be Hearing destruction. There is reported to be no truth in the assertions of Moscow that German workmen are emigrating to Russia.SWITZERLAND.On a referendum, taken in consequence of the refusal of the Delegates to adhere to the Third International, the Swiss Socialist Party has
rejected Lenin&apos;s 21 points by 25,000 against 8,000 votes. Three-fifths of the party seem to have voted. The dissident 8,000 may be taken to represent the convinced Communists of Switzerland.flatten, Schneider, and Belmont, the three Communist members of the Federal Chamber, have announced their adhesion to tho &quot;Parti Communisto Suisse,&quot; which Platten, now that he has served his six months&apos; sentence, will lead. The Party is to have for organ a paper called &quot; L&apos;Avant-Garde,&quot; to be published in Geneva and edited by Humbert-Dross,A good deal of revolutionary activity is in fact reported, though it appears that the &quot; Germ-Cell &quot; system has not so far been adopted for propaganda among Swiss land workers. Special agents visit villages and engage the peasants in Communist conversation. The Communist Ceu-tral, which is in constant touch with French and Italian comrades, is said to have ordered the promotion of manifestations against unemploy-mcnt. It will put an unacceptable proposal to the Federal Council, threatening a general strike in the event of refusal. There is, however, a division of opinion as to the time of action. Workmen&apos;s Councils were to be ready by February in the principal towns and especially in 30 local-ties of French Switzerland. Meanwhile the Syndicalist Union, which adheres to the Second International, is strongly against revolutionary agitation. The Union foresees an attempted Communist revolution during the spring, and means to counter-attack in conjunction with the organisations of London, Paris, and Rome.Bolshevik gold would appear to be arriving regularly in Switzerland, via Stockholm. It is sent to La Chaux-de-Fonds. The International Building Workers&apos; Union of Hamburg is said to have promised the building workers 1,000,000 Swiss francs to defray the costs of the strike, and Jules Humbert-Dross is said to have received 500,000 Swiss francs for revolutionary propaganda. The Co-operative Society of Basle refused to accept the latter sum on deposit.AUSTRIA.Communism.So far as it exists in Austria, Communism is no indigenous growth, but has been introduced from without. It was very long confined to the industrial centres, and has only lately appeared among the agricultural workers. The Communist Party is, however, a tool of Lenin, and Austria, now that the representatives of Moscow are recognised and the notorious &quot; Rosta &quot; agency is established in Vienna, may bo called the Bolshevik power-house for Central Europe, and the starting point for the spread of Bolshevism from North to South. On the whole, only the manual workers, a part of the Wohrmacht, and certain classes of employees are inclined towards revolution, and the authority of the Trade Unions checks Communist propaganda in Vienna itself. The district of Wiener Neustadt and the whole of the industrial district of Sudbahn, is infected with Bolshevism, and the Communist leaders Dr. Frey. Rothe, and Toman are doing very well there. In the provinces Communism pro-gresses very slowly. The Communists are in direct communication with Moscow by couriers. Their leaders are controlled by Lenin through Bronski. Outside Vienna the Trade Union check is weaker and tho revolutionary spirit is stronger. Lately tho the Socialist Left Wing has done very good recruiting work for the Communists.The Communists are well organised. They rely mainly upon the revolutionary Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils, and upon a remarkably
complete system of confidential agents (germ-carriers), who are not engaged upou house-to-house propaganda. Various other organisations exist, and there is also literary and press propaganda.It would not appear, however, that the Communists are yet strong enough to bring about u successful upheaval, and direct plans for a Putsch are for the present set aside, They will not move until the whole proletariat and a part of the Intellectuals have been revolutionised. It is reported that in the spring Communist leaders are sending chosen mem-bers of the Soldiers&apos; Council to Moscow for training as Soviet Commissars for the Red Army and eventually for a similar purpose in Austria. The Communists&apos; light against the Finance Rill is winning them increasing working-class support. The Communist relations with tho Social Democrats, their most dangerous rivals, are strained. Dr. Adler is reported to hope for an alliance of the Social Democrats with the Trades Unions and the Workers&apos; Councils, in order to subvert the Government and to paralyse the Communists, The Social Democrats dream of a bloodless revolution and the maintenance of peace and order by the Wehrmacht and Arbeitwehren. The Communists, however, look upon such a Socialist Government as but preliminary to a proletarian dictator-ship, and they are working at revolutionising the Wehrmacht.Rut when the time comes, it is likely that both parties will combine. Danger from the Communists alone does not appear to bo imminent before the spring. It was thought that much might depend upon tho course of affairs at the International Conference in Vienna towards the end of F ebruary.A conference of the Austrian Communists, at which the Hungarians were represented, adopted as far as possible the new statutes of the United Communist party in Germany, advocated the immediate union of Western Hungary with Austria, but disapproved union with Germany, and decided to pay special attention to agricultural propaganda. It was considered that the systematic disintegration of the Social Democrats depended on the Workmen&apos;s Councils.Communism in the Wehrmacht.An intense and fruitful Communist propaganda proceeds among the Wehrmacht. There arc 30 barrack sections in Vienna, with a membership of about 1,700 Wehrmiinner.The Communist Wehrmauncr, having demonstrated before the Vienna Town Hall, setting up the Soviet Hag on their platform, havo decided to form a central unconstitutional organisation of the Soldiers&apos; Councils, as well as a special Soldiers&apos; Section in the Arbeiterrat, uniting all the Soldatenriite elected to the Arbeiterrat into an active community. It is hoped so to complete the revolutionary units between the factories and barracks, begun by the Soldiers&apos; Union. The most active propaganda in the Wehrmacht was urged to make the Red Army ready for the future Soviet Austria.So divided, in fact, is the feeling in the Wehrmacht that the Govern-meut can in no way count upon their support. The officers fire isolated and perplexed before coming events.The &quot;Pink&quot; International.The Vienna International, variously known as the &quot; Pink &quot; or the &quot; Two and a Half International,&quot; opened in Vienna on February 22nd. Its mission is one which has been attempted before tho formation of an International Working Union of Socialist Parties, open to those parties who belong neither to the Second nor the Third International.   The
presence of a certain number of faint-hearted comrades among tho delegates seems to have perturbed the Austrian Communists, who arranged to hold mass meetings during the Sessions of the Conference. The delegatos included representatives of the British Independent Labour Party, headed by Wall head of Manchester, French Socialists led by Longuet, German Independent Socialists, and others. The Austrian Socialists represented the strongest group at the Conference.P. C. Walihead gave a strongly anti-Imperialist address, which con-sisted mainly of a catalogue of the misdeeds of British Imperialists. His denunciation of the Versailles Treaty, welcomed by the German delegates present, roused the strongest objections, however, in the French delega-tion, who left the hall during the reading of the French translation of his speech. Friedrich Adler was strong in denunciation of Moscow, in whose eyes, he said, the International is merely a means for propaganda and an instrument to divide the Socialist Parties. Tho American Party did not send delegates, giving financial depression and difficulties within the party itself as its reasons. It is believed that the policy of the American Party towards the Versailles Conference will beoneof watchful waiting.Miscellaneous.The Social Democrats pursue unceasingly their policy of harassing tho Government, in order to prove the incapacity of the Christian Socialists. They do not, however, want the Mayr Cabinet to fall until its failure is complete. There are suggestions of a coalition, iu which the Social Democrats are very unlikely to take part.The Hungarian refugees settled in Vienna are split into three main groups. The smallest is Bight Socialist ; the second corresponds more or less to the Austrian Social Democrat Party ; tho third is Communist.Alexandrowski, BronskTs first secretary, is reported to have been studying economic questions with Kopp in Berlin. Bronski means to establish a commercial bureau in Vienna on the same lines as Kopp&apos;s.Trobitseh Lincoln has been arrested in Vienna, whore he has been staying under an assumed name. The police have been watching Lincoln for some lime. Liiieolu&apos;s arrest seems to have been precipitated by the refusal of Dr. Bones, the Czecho-Slovak Foreign Minister, to pay the full price asked for certain documents discovered to be forgeries. Lincoln then threatened to publish other papers which he alleged would create a revolution in Czecho-Slovakia. Since his flight Lincoln seems to have wandered about Austria and Poland under assumed names, and to have announced his own death in local newspapers. Charges of forgery and probably of high treason will be preferred against Lincoln. He asserts that he engineered the Kapp coup in order to be revenged upon England.CZECHO-SLOVAKIA.Extremist Activities.The Brunn Socialists, who argue that the events of December prove the complete incompetence of the Prague clique, were asking in January for the transfer of the executive of the Communist Party from Prague to Brunn. Czech and German Communists had held a conference in lieichenberg with a view to the foundation of a united Communist party. The Left Wing of the Social Democratic Party then decided to instruct the workmen iu the doctrines of the Third International and to take a referendum of local organisations on the question of union with the international.   A Party Congress is being called for March 26th
and 27tb. Meanwhile, tho Czecho-Slovak Labour Socialist Party in Prague has condemned Communist methods and the Communist tendency of the Left Socialists.At their congress held in conjunction with the Slovak National Socialist Party, the Czecho-Slovak National Socialist Party declared that their programme was essentially socialistic, subordinated only to the interests and tho protection of the Republic, It is pointed out that tho formation of a common international proletariat party within tho Republic is impossible without a common economic organisation and a clear understanding of the national aims of the party. The general meeting of the German Social Democratic Left will be held on March 12th.Erno Por, formerly a Peopled Commissary under Bel a Kun, is reported to be guiding the formation in Kaschau of a new Communist centre, called a Reorganisation (&quot;entre. Bcla Kun himself appears to have been charged iu Russia with forming an Austrian Soviet and a German Soviet, and Por, who had close personal connections with Kun, is doing the preliminary organisation work. The Kaschau office, which seems to be in touch with Gorman Left Social Democrat members of the Czech National Assembly, has for programme to direct the Communist movement in Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, and Hungary, to determine the methods of proletariat class war, and to distribute and direct propaganda money. Activity is chiefly directed against Poland and there are plans to support, in particular by a railway strike, a Russian offensive against Poland. As regards Slovakia, the policy appears to be one of encouraging the National Slovakian movement, and ultimately of exploiting it to Communist ends. With a view to safety the Kaschau Communists are organised in groups of fO.The raid on the Prague &quot;Volkshaus&quot; last December discovered papers establishing inter alict the responsibility of Jaroslav Ilandlir for the Kladno outbreak, and the fact that Jie &quot;was the medium for all correspondence between local Communists and Moscow. Handlir was once secretary of the Executive Committee of the Czecho-Slovak Communist Party in Moscow, where he was associated with Muna. Ho is probably far more dangerous than even Muna.Anti-Czech Intrigues.A secret Polish military organisation known as &quot;Polska Organisace Wojskowa&quot; (P.O.W.) is reported to be active in Polish and Czech Teschen. Poles and Slovaks who can prove their enmity against the Czecho-Slovak Republic are recruited as volunteers and distributed to different places as workmen, artisans, &amp;c, 13,000 men have so far been distributed through Poland and some 6,000 in Czecho-Slovakia. Their chief mission is to conduct a sabotage war behind the enemy&apos;s force, to provoke riots, and forward intelligence to tho Polish higher command. The so-called Magyar-Slovak legion, which operates along the Slovakian border, is similar in organisation.At the end of January many documents were discovered proving Gorman collusion with the Hungarian agitation in Slovakia. Dr. Peters, of Prague, heads this organisation, and has formed in the &quot; Deutsches Haus &quot; in Prague a veritable committee of action for separatist pro-paganda in Slovakia. Three Hungarian spies arrested in Slovakia have been condemned to death.The arrest by the Czech police of an individual named Robert Huebner as a German spy has brought to light some details of German
espionage organisation. The documents in IIuebner&apos;s possession included a questionnaire for the organisation of so-called sports clubs on the lines of those in Germany affiliated to the Orgesch. This is apparently meant to enable the military authorities at Breslau to get control of demobilised Zeitfreiwilligen formerly belonging to the Baltic regiment or tho Sudeten regiment now living in the north of Bohemia. A list was also found of individuals, chiefly ex-Reichswehr officers living in Czecho-Slovakia, considered trustworthy, and in reality controlling these organisations. Local reunions appear to be held on the pretext of forming an anti-Bolshevik Burgerwehr, but such meetings are really inspired by the Orgesch.A raid Into in December on the offices of the Karlsbad branch of the Sudetenland League, and of the premises occupied by Josef Korec, discovered documentary evidence of the anti-Czech activities of the League, and of its financing by German magnates and landed proprietors. Korec is under surveillance. His propaganda has for object the union of the Germans of Bohemia and Austria with Germany and tho union of Slovakia with Hungary. The &quot;Volksliga der Sudetcnlitnder&quot; and the &quot; Union of Democratic Control&quot; are a link in the world-wide propaganda of the &quot;Hoimatsdionsf&quot; disguised as u Heiinatschutz &quot; or as &quot; Gennania Irredenta.&quot; The suppressed newspaper, &quot; Volksbund,&quot; of which Korcc was editor, will, it is said, reappear at Rcichonborg under tho title of &quot; Volksrecht.&quot;Anti-Communist Measures.The Government are acting forcibly against revolutionary agents. Recent arrests are those of Armin Gyozo, editor of the newspaper &quot;Munkas Ujsag,&quot; and Jean Mondek, a Hungarian Communist, some-time editor of the Moscow &quot; Pravda,&quot; and lately returned from Russia.In the trials of the Communists arrested during the December riots the judges treated the prisoners as individuals misled by leaders them-selves immune as deputies. Sentences have usually been from four to&quot; eight months&apos; imprisonment. These sentences were frequently conditional, and were to be served only if the prisoners are in trouble again within tho next two years.The dissolution of the Russian Red Cross Mission is announced. It is very probable that Gillerson (or Hillerson) will transfer his activities to Berlin.HUNGARY.The Finance Minister is reported to have granted, at the third tin e of asking, additional funds for munitions from England, explaining that he does not wish to assume responsibility should tho spring offensive by Soviet Russia find Hungary unprepared. Large quantities of khaki cloth are said to have arrived from England, as well as sealed railway trucks from Italy containing machine guns.The latest information regarding John W. De Kay tends to show that he thrice visited Hungary in July, August, and November 1920. He wants to overthrow the Versailles Treaty, and to repair the prejudice done to Hungary by the Trianon Treaty. He meant to found a &quot; Hungarian Economical Union,&quot; to which Hungarians should subscribe for the financial redemption of their country.
4. RUSSIA AND THE BORDER STATES. RUSSIA.General.The Soviet Government is faced with three difficult tusks, almost impossible of fulfilment : military preparations for a possible war in the spring; obligatory cultivation of the laud by the peasants ; recon-struction of industry and transport.It is difficult to realise the misery of the population and tho state of decay into which the country has fallen. From every point of view the economic situation becomes worse day by day. Largo numbers of people die of cold in tho terrible frosts (up to 25 degrees Reaumur). Moscow, Petrograd, Tver, Nijni-Novgorod, and other large towns aro without fuel, as the railways are at a standstill owing to lack of fuol and engines. Traffic is completely stopped ou 42 lines, and almost so on the lines Moscow - Kursk - Kharkov, Kiev - Zaraziu - Kupiansk, and Kharkow -Losowaja, Poltava-Kiev, Kicv-Woroshba, and a few others. The amount of railway material needing repair increases daily, and the railway Avorkshops at Kiev, Kharkov, Moscow, Sinelnikowo, Ekaterinoslav, Jasinowataja are partly closed on account of lack of tools and materials. The workmen escape into the villages. Only military trains and trains carrying food and fuel are run.The lack of food is terrible and the prices incredible. Even a month ago bread could be had in Moscow (secretly) for 350 roubles a pound ; now it is 750 to 1,000 roubles. Butter, formerly 5,000, is now 14,000 to 15,000 a pound. Meat, instead of 3,000, costs 6,000 to 7,000 roubles a pound. Wood and coal are not to be had at any price. The populace in its despair burns everything that it can find. The wooden houses in the suburbs of Moscow, &amp;c, have been pulled down and burnt.The workmen in Moscow and Petrograd are very depressed at the reduction of the food rations, but especially at the closing down of even the large factories and workshops. There is positive information that the Supreme Economic Council has decided to close 85 factories in Petrograd and Moscow on account of lack of coal and raw materials. Even factories like Igorsky, Putiloff, and Siemens and Ilalske aro to bo partly closed down. Only those factories which are absolutely necessary for military purposes or to keep transport going are to be kept working.Tho Government does not know Avhat to do with the unemployed, whose numbers will be increased by the closing down of the factories and workshops. It is afraid to dismiss them altogether, as then they will leave the towns and take refuge in the country, and it cannot afford to keep them on account of the shortage of food. In order to pacify the workers they are told that the restriction of production and the closing of the factories are only temporary measures.The internal unrest in the country continues. There were great revolts of the peasants in the Governments of Kostroma, Tula, and Jaroslav in the beginning of February on account of the seizure of seed. These riots were so serious that three Communist battalions with light artillery were sent from Moscow to suppress them. In the report in the secret newspaper of the commissaries it is mentioned that 28 Soviet
employees and commissaries were killed and 2-1 wounded, and over 300 peasants, soldiers, and women killed. Smaller riots took place in the Governments of Samara and Saratov. The reason is everywhere the same : the peasants object strongly to the decree of the 8th Congress as to compulsory cultivation of the soil and surrender of thoir seed.Even more serious were the conflicts which began early in February between the sailors at Kronstadt and the Soviet Govern-ment, and which the latter endeavoured to hush up. The Kronstadt sailors, who were the originators of the Bolshevik revolution, have latterly shown a remarkable inclination towards tho Right. Not only is a national movement taking place in their ranks, but also a religious movement. In addition, the Kronstadt Soviet refused to obey a number of orders given by tho Supremo Military Revolutionary Council, and sent a delegation, composed of sailors, to Moscow to negotiate with Trotsky. Trotsky had the delegation arrested, and telegraphed to Kronstadt that the military orders wore to be carried out at once. It is reported that there was a short light, which ended in the suppression of the mutiny.Anti-Soviet Disturbances.Disturbances became serious in Petrograd on February 23rd. Food-stuffs were plundered. During the first, fortnight of February, Petrograd. instead of its necessary minimum of -1,000 wagons of these, had received only 2,300. An unprecedented lack of find was also reported. The &quot; Red Gazette &quot; confessed that in the university lecture rooms and the class rooms of the schools the temperature was 16 degrees below zero centigrade. In Petrograd the standard of revolt was raised against the Soviet, and numbers of soldiers appear to have given weapons to the insurgents, who were joined by mutinous sailors. Widespread disorders also broke out in Moscow either on the 23rd or-21th. According to a statement telegraphed to Riga by the Lettish Mission in Moscow, 14,000 workmen, including those of the printing establishments, struck ou February 21th, demanding increased rations, liberty of commerce, the guarantee of the rights of man, and the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. Soviet soldiers ordered to disperse the workmen had refused. Tho Soviet authorities gave au account of the course of events similar in outline, but in low relief, and added that &quot; after explanations by the Government, calm had been restored.&quot;The revolt, which in essence may be considered a gesture of despair, was primarily due to the lack of food and fuel, and the ill-conceived method of military demobilisation, as well as to the deep dissensions in essential points of policy, including the question of concessions to foreign capitalists, the question of encouragement of revolutionary activity or international conflicts abroad, and the role of the trade unions in Soviet Russia itself, regarding which last the points of view of the various parties are described in Part II. of this issue.On March 3rd the Russian situation is very reliably reported to have stood as follows : Petrograd and Kronstadt were firmly held by the counter-revolutionaries. Certain International divisions and Kuban and Bashkir cavalry sent to Petrograd declared themselves neutral and had been removed to Bologovo. At Sajasan the Soviet of Commissaries had been arrested by revolutionaries. At Jaroslav a number of the Chresvychaika had been executed, and the town was held by temporary revolutionary committee.   At Kasan the Commission of Tartar Republic had been
arrested. At Kalvaa a White rising had been suppressed by the Soviet authorities and order hail been restored, but the temper of the peasants was dangerous. At Orel all Soviet institutions had been seized and the railway workmen had struck, At Briansk the garrison had surrendered to tho Strike Committee.Moscow was then still held by reliable Communist troops. There had boon much street-fighting aud the suburbs had been occupied by the counter-revolutionaries. A Committee of Defence, headed by Lenin and Trotsky, had been formed and the Chancery moved to Ninji Novgorod.Between the 3rd and the 7th matters in Moscow attained to the impor-tanooof a serious crisis. The outskirts of the town were full of fires and disturbances and the commissars were seeking refuge in the Kremlin. By the 8th, however, the rising at Moscow seems to have been got in hand by the Soviet authorities and quiet appears to have been restored.At Kronstadt, meanwhile, tho revolutionaries appeared to be in a stronger position. Colonel Koslovsky, a capable artillery officer, was G.O.C. troops. A temporary Revolutionary Committee, under the presidency of Petruchonko aud vice-presidency of Arkhipoff and Jacovenko, proclaimed thomsolves as of no party and as fighting for individual freedom. Tho tone of a newspaper they published was rovo-lulionary, calling for a true Soviet Government against the tyranny of the present regime.This attitude they appear to have maintained despite the blandishments both of the Whites and of the Social Revolutionaries, both of whom, eager to profit by the successful disturbance, offered to provision the revolutionaries upon conditions. The revolutionaries, however, showed reluctance to commit themselves to any political party and were even careful in approaching the question of a Constitution. Whatever their ultimate political tendency might become, they apparently realised for the present that, the policy of the greatest advantage to themselves is that of Leninism diverted towards democracy.There was reason to believe that apart from the question of provisions, of which supplies were said to be sufficient till March 20th, tho revolutionaries are not ill-placed. The total population of Kronstadt was 75,000, of which 55,000 constituted the fighting strength. There was ammunition for full and continuous use during six months. The men serving the artillery are of pre-Bolshevik days. The spirits of the inhabitants wore reported high, despite the reduced rations, and they continue unanimously to support the Revolutionary Committee.Meanwhile Finland was a whirl of intrigue between Whites and Social Democrats ovor the question of the provisioning of Kronstadt, aud it may bo not unreasonably suspected that the reported refusal of the Finns to alloAV the Russian Bed Cross to send provisions to the Island was due to White influences. It appears to bo true that the Whites would prefer the failure of the rising to a success on the part of the Social Revolutionaries. This is by no means the first demonstration of a closer bond between Czarism and Bolshevism than between either and reasonable democracy.The fall of Kronstadt, on March 16th, was due to treachery by the Commander of a single fort. The Bolshevik troops then penetrated into the town and surprised the garrison in a thick mist. 30,000 refugees from Kronstadt are reported to have arrived in Finland.o as 8718 d
Soviet Foreign Policy.The disturbances in Russia lie very near the heart of Soviet policy, and aro intimately connected with the differences between the two parties of militants and opportunists headed by Trotsky and Lenin respectively. These disputes extend over the whole field of foreign policy. Trotsky holds that the aim of the Soviet authorities in the west should bo to render possible a short armed attack by the proletarian masses in western countries and their rapid victory over capitalism. Lenin, on the other hand, desires to see Soviet power strengthened by the conclusion of commercial treaties and the recognition of the Soviet Government, means whereby the &quot; inevitable&quot; world revolution can be brought about more gradually, but with less danger. Roth Krassin and Kopp are upholders of Lenin&apos;s point of view. Gillorson, the Soviet representative in Prague, is a convinced follower of Trotsky. Litvinoll&apos; showed himself the super-opportunist that ho is by concealing his bent and waiting till he was sure which way the cat would jump. When Leniu&apos;s victory became obvious he took his part with all the fresh enthusiasm of a neophyte. On Krassiu&apos;s return from England the Trotsky party was in firm position. The garrison at Moscow and a great part of the working population were on its side. In both the Central Executive Committee and the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissars, however, he was in a minority, though the responsible leaders of the party did not dare to go openly against what was virtually a dictatorship. It is reported on excellent authority that things even went so far that by Djerjinsky&apos;s order the house of Lunarcharsky, one of the &quot; moderates,&quot; was searched.The ultimate victory of the &quot; Opportunist&quot; or Trading party under Lenin was duo to the arrival of Zinovieff from Petrograd. Zinovieffs decisive opposition to Trotsky turned the scale in Leniu&apos;s favour. Lenin carried the day by au overwhelming majority. Trotsky&apos;s position grew weaker. Some of his followers, including, it is said, Djerjinsky, Bucharin, and Stalin acknowledged their defeat and resigned.That the deciding influence should have come from Petrograd is significant. For some time the situation there had been menacing. The workmen in Kronstadt were ready to fight against the dictatorship ; the garrison clamoured for demobilisation ; the workmen and professional unions were against Trotsky ; the rich peasants in the Petrograd district were capable of developing the party split into the anti-Bolshevik movement. Tho Soviet of Peopled Commissars had to take decisive measures, and the Moscow garrison was moved in the direction of Petrograd, while the militant policy of Trotsky was forced to give way, temporarily at least, to Lenin&apos;s policy of procrastination.Accordingly, on February 8th, Tchiteherin transmitted instructions approved by the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissars to his representatives abroad. These instructions lay down a new policy. Stress is now laid on the fomentation, by intrigue and mischief-making, of international strife among the nations of the west and the revolutionary consequences resulting therefrom. To this end the international position of the Soviet government is to be stabilised and increased by trade, the sale of con-cessions, and the conclusion of commercial agreements, having as their final aim the full recognition of the Soviet government by western countries. Tho first step and the basis of the new political programme is the immediate conclusion of the Anglo-Russian commercial agreement.
Meanwhile, the instructions proceed, the policy of revolution will not be discontinued, but placed under full control of the Soviet representative in different countries, through whom alone funds will bo supplied to the various revolutionary organisations.The Soviet Foreign Office and the Committee of  the Third International.This means in effect that the Soviet government has discovered that the orientation of its foreign policy in the direction of fomentation of international as opposed to revolutionary strife makes it imperative that there should he definite spheres of influence for their trade and diplo-matic representatives abroad on tho one hand and the branches of the Third International on the other. The attempt to render the two organisations parallel and independent has proved a failure. A want of caution ou the part of the Soviet representatives in communication with local groups and excessive zeal on the part of sub-departments of tho Third International abroad have put the oflieial representatives in an embarrassing situation, compromising not only for individuals, but for tho whole of the diplomatic representation of Soviet Russia. Tho effect of the conflict has been disastrous for tho work of tho Soviet Foreign Office abroad. The Soviet government now recognises that only definite subordination ou the part of the organs and agents of the Third Inter-national to the Soviet representative can provont undesirable complications in future.On the one hand, therefore, thore is to be complete centralisation of all representatives and agencies under the direction of a single authorised chief, Tchitcherin, who will receive his instructions direct from the Soviet of People&apos;s Commissars. Below this Foreign Minister there will he three ambassadors in Roval (Litvinolf), in London (Krassin), and in Rome (Vorovsky). These &quot;ambassadors&quot; will have charge of &quot; ambas-sadorial &quot; districts, and are responsible for the activity of the &quot; charges ifaffaires &quot; in tho countries belonging to them. Subordinate to Reval will bo Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Czecho-Slovakia, and the Scan-dinavian countries. Subordinate to London will be France, Spain, and Portugal. Subordinate to Rome will be Roumania, Hungary, German Austria, and the Balkan States. It will be noted that &quot; ambassadorial &quot; centres are places in countries which have not, on principle, shut their doors in tho face of the Soviet Trade representatives countries, in other words, which have showed themselves willing to be tempted. In close touch with &quot;charges d&apos;affaires&quot; and &quot;ambassadors&quot; will be the organisations affiliated in the different countries to the Third Inter-onational.On the other hand, however, the Soviet, while shaping this regular hierarchy, considers it necessary to separate the financial department of its official representatives and the Foreign Ollice budget from extraneous outlay upon unofficial organisations of party or socialist character abroad. It is essential that the system of mixed credits hitherto obtaining should cease. Missions and Representatives may be authorised to lend money to revolutionary organisations, but must then ask for additional credits, through the Soviet Foreign Office, from the Third International or such other organisation of which the debtor agency may be a branch. In other words, the &quot; Ambassador &quot; and his subordinate &quot; Charges d&apos;Affaires &quot; will- keep both their own accounts and the accounts of the Third International, but will keep them separately, and the Soviet Foreign Office and&apos;Missions will act as intermediaries for requests on the partd 2
of revolutionary organisations to the Central Committee of the Third International.This scheme gilds with pinchbeck virtue any Soviet &quot;Ambassador&quot; or &quot; Charge d&apos;Affaires&quot; who denies reproaches made to him by the government to which he is accredited that his government is financing revolutionary or subversive organisations on its territory. His denial will bear tho semblance of truth, since in matters of finance ho and the Foreign OHice behind him only act as post box between the revolutionary organisation and its fountain head in the Third International. Upon the fact that, apart from finance, the &quot; Ambassadors &quot; actual control of revolutionary affairs is increased, and that he is now, in truth, the official instigator and co-ordinafor of such affairs within the country or group of countries to which his jurisdiction extends, the shadow of discretion may be allowed to rest.The New Conspiracy.So ordered, the Soviet representation abroad is reorganised to engage in open fight with Western Imperialism. It is now the view in the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs that the internal breakdown has made the whole future of Soviet Russia depend on the use its diplomats can make of the political situation in Europe. Tho Soviet regime can never count on peace with the capitalist west. War must continue in the sphere of economic and moral relations. Active propaganda cannot now bo relied upon to provoke social revolution in the west. Sooner or later it will do its work, but it can only proceed slowly and systematically.Fortunately the position of Europe is not hopeful. Comrade Krassin has come to the conclusion that the economic situation in England is very bad. Comrade Kopp considers tho economic position of Germany to be so poor that ono&apos;s hope must be centred in England. The League of Nations has failed. The peace of Versailles has followed the other scrap of paper. Every country is tending towards political complications which rjau only result in armed conflict.Since the solution can only be war, and complications are inevitable, the Soviet government must be in a position to make use of them. War with Poland has no sense. France wants it. Peace in the East means that capitalist countries will pick quarrels amongst themselves. Should war in Poland become inevitable not even a complete victory in that war can bring a solution of Russian political problems in the west. The destruction of Poland would profit only Germany, and woidd be disastrous to Russia, whose bauds must be free for the more important conflict in the West, which may start cither on a purely Franco-German basis or between England and America. &quot; By the effect of historic sequence&quot; a phrase as comforting as the blessed word Mesopotamia capitalist diplomats will fall into some stupidity. All Russian efforts must be concentrated on hindering them. Germany wants moral support; we will give it; security as to her Eastern frontier ; we will promise it. France wants to be convinced of our hopeless condition ; we will prove it. England wants to exploit us ; we will give her full opportunity. The centre of equilibrium must be transferred from Poland to tiio West. Our represen-tatives must render their positions more firm. It is not to our advantage &quot; to be feared or exaggerated.&quot; We must be forgotten. The official recognition of our representative, the development of peasant activity,
quiet propaganda, an insidious strengthening of our authority, that is the our work.Regarding commerce, the division of Russia into spheres of iulluenco for the various countries can partly solve the economic crisis. Russia will support the hope that the feverish activity to find markets for sale, which the acute crises through which Europe is passing engenders in capitalists, will be profitable, Capitalists will send cheap goods into Russia in the hope of commanding a market. &quot; They will not get their market, arid we shall profit by the goods,&quot; Even if some of their leaders are aware of this, the political situation (created presumably by agitation aud propaganda) will force them to agree to an exchange of goods which will stabilise Soviet representation abroad and put its members into a position to seize opportunities of fomenting strife. IIungary&apos;s relations with its neighbours especially may develop into contradictions and disputes on purely national grounds. Rut it is an ill field that will not grow weeds. In the West the accumulation of unsolved political questions and the economic crisis are pregnant with national discord.In the event of failure the centre of diplomatic work may have to be transferred to the Balkan States and the East, but for Soviet Russia this would be less favourable, as in tho East the conflict might be localised.There is, in fact, a growing feeling in Bolshevik circles that pro-paganda ami peaceful penetration have given and are likely to give disappointing results, and that war might possibly be a better way, especially as it is widely believed among local Communists that in the event of quarrels being engineered by Soviet Russia the Allied Govern-ments will either make great concessions to stave off war or, if forced into it, will very soon have big mutinies among the troops, which mutinies will lead in the revolution.The Retain of 1VI. Krassin and his Trade Negotiations in Berlin.&quot;With the official views of the Moscow Foreign Office as set forth above at least one of their diplomats is at considerable variance. In some respects M. Krassin is more German than Russian, and it has for long been clear that he sees in Russia mainly a field for German commercial and industrial exploitation. France and Poland, therefore, to him are serious obstacles, second only to that delay in signing the British Trade Agreement &quot;so crippling to the Russo-German trade combination, which it is his fixed purpose to effect.There is reason to believe, despite M. Krassin&apos;s insistence upon the importance of the differences regarding propaganda in the Trade Agrec-ment, that he really believes that the main difficulty will be the question of how to sell Russian gold at the best price to provide immediate pay--ment for the prime necessities of industry which the Russians require to purchase. He recognises that this involves the Russians in probable legal difficulties, similar to those which arose over the Sagor Ply Wood case, which, he contends, must be quickly settled for the benefit of both parties. Any ambiguity about the legal right in capitalist countries of the Soviet Government to act as it did in nationalising the goods of subjects of those countries in Russia will, he recognises, be fatal to the Russians in the Trade Agrsement. Russia, M. Krassin says, is willing to strip herself to the skin for machinery; even such necessities as clothes and tea, of which she been long deprived, must wait, or, if they are bought now, must be bought on such credit as can be obtained.See also in this issue under Germany, pages 19-25.
After the signing of the Trade Agreement in London, the principal question as regards Russian foreign trade is the question of trade with Germany and of the position of Poland with regard to it. Large eon-tracts for locomotives and rolling stock are in process of negotiation between the Soviet Authorities and a group of some In leading engineer-ing firms with Krupp at their head, It is reported that the order for locomotives may ultimately amount to 2,000, and is being entered into with the approval of the German Government, Dr. Wiodfoldt, one of the chief official members of the Commission which prepared the German counter-proposals along with Heir von Simons, is taking a leading part in the matter. The fact that he was endeavouring to force it to a con-clusiou independently of the results of the Conference in London, and of its being almost ridiculous under the circumstances to push on with a deal of such importance, seems to indicate that political ends figured as largely in his calculations as purely commercial objects.M. Krassin, in Berlin, on his return from Russia, ordered GOO locomotion-tives, 300 for delivery before December 1021, all for delivery before March 1022. The payment, it has been arranged, will be made in instalments through Peval; the stock price of the locomotives ox-ware-house is 119,400 gold roubles. Both instalments aro to he paid before March 25th, no delay being possible because the deal is based upon tho opportunity afforded by payments in gold tit Stockholm by the Deutsche Bank under its war obligations.The truth is that any failure, e.ff., in the arrival of gold at Stockholm, would not only cause the order for the locomotives to fall through, hut would also complicate the German situation as regards Russian trade, which is au exceedingly delicate one. If the commercial treaty is signed with Great Britain, Russian gold can be sold there, and Krassin would have the right to use the proceeds as he thought fit, and to employ English currency for conversion into marks or kronen. Failing immediate signature of the treaty, however, German firms are awkwardly placed. They cannot accept Russian gold because they aro afraid of the French. They cannot guarantee delivery of goods because for political reasons they-are not sure that Poland would allow transit, and they are further&quot; more uncertain what steps French creditors of Russia might take in respect of goods consigned to the Soviet Government. The situation is further complicated by the fluctuation in the German exchange, which would not permit of prices being fixed for big orders. The directors of important firms, such as Krupps, from whom Krassiu 1ms ordered the. locomotives, are therefore of opinion that their trade with Russia entirely depends on the signing of the commercial treaty in England. Failing this there appear to be only two courses open : first, that orders for Russian locomotives should be placed in Great Britain and a part of the order sub-contracted by British concerns to the German locomotive factories, led by Krupp ; or, second, the elimination of Poland and tho French influence there as a barrier between Soviet Russia and Germany. It is now almost notorious that Heir Hugo Stiiines and the other big German financiers with whom Krassin and the Trading Party in Russia are in close sympathy and collaboration believe that the commercial alliance of the future is that between Germany and Soviet Russia. Persons in the immediate entourage of Stinnes point out that of the three million consumers in Europe, approximately one half are Russians, and that as these are the people who are in a position to pay Germany for goods delivered with gold, raw materials, or natural resources, and as tho Germans are near to Russia and understand the Russian psychology, all interests, both political and commercial, point to the close interworking of the two countries.
The Commercial agreement in London is, then, in Krassin&apos;s eyes, practically an instrument for eliminating the necessity of brokerage between the two countries on the part of foreign capitalists. Krassin strongly objects to anything like a control of German industry, or the establishment of working understandings between English and German (inns, as making for trusts and high prices. As long as the Trade Agreement is not signed big contracts will bo dependent, as in the case of the present Russian order for 600 locomotives, Upon opportunities of settlement similar to that of Copenhagen, or upon the interest which British or American firms would have to act as middlemen between tho two. The signature of the Agreement, therefore, would appear to entail tho loss of a British commercial privilege.The political and geographical situation of Poland lays it open to grave risks in this regard, Krassin has said openly that the independence of Poland depends upon herself; that she cannot compete industrially with Germany or with any other western country. Poland, he says, is au Eastern state, and her face should be turned towards Russia and the East. That is, before Poland and her industries can be economically stabilised, she must have transit through Russia, and Russia must have railroads. On Pohiud&apos;s attitude depends the stability of the now countries created by the Versailles Treaty, and, in fact, the whole position of Central Europe. If Polaud&apos;s policy becomes too Western, and she, or tho French behind her, refuse to allow Soviet Russia to import goods from Germany by not giving transit, her attitude endangers her independence.It is reported from a source upon which the utmost reliance can be placed thai the next move on the part of Moscow to Poland will be a demand for free transit, without which, if the commercial treaty is not signed, the Soviet Authorities Avill contend that the Russian people cannot live.M. Krassin in Stockholm.During his stay in Stockholm on his way to Moscow, in January, M. Krassin was received by the Minister for Foreign Allans. It is reported that he then asked that the Swedish Government should approve the appointment of M, Kersjentscheff as head of the Russian Trade Delegation. The Swedish Government acceded to this request. M. Krassin refused indiscriminate interviews, but he saw the representa-live of the Rosta Bureau, and an account of the meeting appeared in some Swedish newspapers. &quot;Politiken&quot; published an interview Avith Krassin, which was a literal translation of the interview previously reported by the &quot;Daily Herald.&quot; In the &quot; Svenska Dagbladet&quot; M. Krassin was reported as suggesting that Swedish enterprises might be conceded, among other things, rights to cut timber, wood-working factories, metal factories, and the exploitation of naphtha. Krassin is said to have been purposely pessimistic in order to bring pressure upon litvinoff, and so to defeat the policy of intensive propaganda which is supported by Lenin and Tchiteherin.Foreign Trade.Various trading schemes are in the air. One foreshadows a syndica(e with a nominal capital of about 1,000,000/., which should be organised from vickers, Krupp, and Siemens Halske; the other, a big timber firm and a bank, for the purpose of repairing the locomotives in Russia. Russia has now 4,000 locomotives running which are not in perfect order, and about 12,000 which are out of order entirely. The suggestion that Krassin should order 5,000 new locomotives would entail an expenditure of 75,000,000/., which Russia has not got.   Moreover, such locomotives
would be two years in delivery, whereas 5,000 locomotives might be repaired in one year at a cost of about 10,000,000/. for spare parts. It is surmised that the Soviet will grant one or two special factories, probably at Nikolaieff, ou the Black Sea. The new Company will be considered only as tenant of these factories ; the Soviet will find labour, the Company having the right to grant bonuses. Krassin appears to have ready the suggestion that 10,000 or 50,000 workmen should bo organised under foreign control. The new Company would look after the export of certain goods from Southern Russia, partly in payment for the work done, so that the Soviet might be spared the expenditure of as much cash as possible.In the case of the second Company, the Soviet wants to grant a concession of 600,000 acres of Government ground in the South of Russia, in return for the cultivation of the laud, mainly in producing grain. The Company should provide the necessary machinery, for which the Soviet would give the British Government au adequate guarantee, and the grain would be divided between the Soviet and the concessionaire Company.It is reported that, under Litvinolfs influence, Lomonosoff has apparently been empowered to reorganise the Russian railways, without consulting Krassin, with whom he is at variance. Krassin knows all the technicalities of tho large order for rolling stock, which has lately been under discussion with Armstrong Whit worth, but he was compelled to ask his expert, Ivitsky, together with Armstrong^ representative, to go to Stockholm for Lomonosotfs decision.The Bolshevik Trade Delegation in London is endeavouring to win over French business circles (which have been spreading it abroad that all Bolshevik business ends in talk) by placing orders with French manu-facfurors and business men for 3,000,000 francs. They couple their offer with the condition that the French shall admit Russian agents for local inspection of the material produced.The impression that the Armstrong locomotives deal was entered into mainly for political purposes is strengthened by information regarding the rejection of a similar offer to make spare parts and boilers for the Soviet Government by Messrs. vickers, on conditions oven more favourable to the Soviet than were the Armstrong conditions. Messrs. Vickcrs were informed that English prices were altogether too high, and that as long as they remained so competition either with the French or with the Belgians was impossible.Early in the month there were believed to be indications of a deliberate sabotage of particular commercial transactions between Soviet Russia and England on the part of the Communists in Russia and perhaps in Moscow.An agreement is reported to have been made between M. Krassin and tho Slough Trading Company for a large number of motor lorries specially constructed and rebuilt for service in Russia. The agreement will come into force as soon as the Trade Agreement between Great Britain and Russia is signed.After originally intending to have their works at Pskov, Krupps are now said to be negotiating the lease of the Putiloff works for the manu-facture of guns and military material. The works will be officially administered by the Soviet Government, but the management and most of the skilled labour will be German.A Lettish newspaper reports that a treaty has been concluded for the opening of an American factory, Avhich is to keep 10 per cent, of the net profits, in the Akmoliusk district.   For purposes of electrification a
Swedish society is building an electro-turbine factory at Jaroslavy. It has been granted complete freedom iu technical and administrative measures,Goods passing into Russia via Eslhonia during 1920 amounted, it is reported, to 2-1,389 tons in bulk, and goods from Russia to 3,537 tons, plywood accounting for 2,382 tons, ilax for 1,132 tons, and miscellaneous goods for 23 tons.Tho Russian Soviet Government appears to have asked the Persian Sovnakom some time ago to repay a portion of the huge funds spent by the Soviet on Asiatic propaganda, ill gold, precious stones, and carpets, things easily sold abroad. The Bolsheviks have, indeed, themselves formed a carpet fund, supplied by wholesale confiscations. In Pctrograd alone more than 25,000 stolen carpets have been accumulated, which an; being offered to American traders in exchange for manufactured articles. The steamer &quot;Ancona,&quot; which reached Maples from Novorossisk on February 10th, had a huge consignment of carpets iu her cargo. In connection with this matter the present glut of carpets in England is noteworthy.The Reval Trade Delegation.In connection with a cancelled order for medical goods, Solomon, at Reval, was, in December, plaintively pointing out. the difficulties created for the Soviet by such action. Latterly,&quot; he says, &quot;Moscow more and &quot; more frequently compels mo to cancel oven contracts which have been &quot; concluded with the knowledge and consent of the Peopled Com-&quot; missariat for Foreign Trade. ... 1, personally, in guarding the &quot; interests of the Government, must unhesitatingly settle the malicious &quot; and rapacious demands of the suppliers, but still (here are certain &quot; commercial politics and tact which ought to be observed in this respect &quot; which are worthy of a Soviet Government aud not of a petty shop-&quot; keeper.&quot; He points out the impossibility of cancelling contracts with solid Western European firms on mere formal grounds, when the quality and price of the goods accord with the actual state of the markets. Elsewhere Solomon complains of the rank atmosphere in which he has to work &quot;an atmosphere of lies, slander, intrigues, opposition, corn-plaints.&quot;The Foreign Office and Foreign Delegations.It is reported that the Foreign Oflice is divided into an Eastern Section under Karakhan and a Western Section under Litvinoif, who retains nominal charge. Nuorteva manages the subsection for the Entente aud Scandinavia. Three Englishmen work under him William-son for passports, Suinmerfield for translations, and J. Ritchie for political work. Kantarovitch controls the diplomatic couriers, Sando-mirsky the printing and propaganda department, and Pastukhov the foreign missions.The Bolshevik Intelligence dealing with the Near East is reported to have two important subsections, at, Novorossisk and Rostov respec-tively, where is established the Special Branch of the Caucasian front. Novorossisk controls the work of the Constantinople, Trebizond, and Batum branches ; Rostov that of Tiflis and Baku. Both branches are directly under Moscow.The position of Andrew Rothstein, the son of Theodore Rothstein, is believed to have a semi-official connection with the Soviet Trade Delega-tion in London. His connection with the Trade Delegation will bo confirmed upon the eventual conclusion of the trade agreement Theodore Rothstein&apos;s early departure for Persia is confirmed.
Roderick Connolly, the son of Jim Connolly, ;ind Archie Iliron, organiser of the Irish Union and Transport Workers, are reported to bo visiting Moscow to report upon affairs in Ireland and to get money for the Irish movement, and particularly the Irish revolutionary Labour weekly, &quot;The Voice of the Workers.&quot; Moscow was advised that little advantage would be gained by such subsidies.Moscow intimates that a conference between delegates of the Turkish Nationalist Government and the Russian Soviet Government is taking place at Moscow. Tin; Turks included Vusuf Iveinal Bey, Ali Fua Pasha, and Riza Nur Hey ; the Russians, Tchitcherin and Korkmasotf, a member of the All-Russian Executive Committee.Delegates from Pekin have arrived in Moscow to discuss with the Soviet the terms of a treaty hot ween China and Russia, &quot; in connection with the refusal of China to let other countries exploit her.&quot; Many Chinese students have also arrived in Moscow to study the situation in Russia. They arc receiving special privileges. Some of the ablest agitators and orators at the disposal of the Soviet have been sent on propaganda missions lo the Indian and Chinese frontiers. They took with them propaganda printed in English, and much gold of inferior quality.Social and Economic.Evidence of the growing intensity of the economic crisis is aceumu-lating. The Bolshevik press complains bitterly that there are only words, not actions ; the Moscow &quot; Pravda &quot; goes so far as to write of &quot; complete defeat on the economic front.&quot; Tlie colliers of the Don have written to Lenin saying : &quot; We have worked without boots, without &quot; coats, half starved. In the mines, boilers, machinery, pumps, and &quot; electric lamps are completely lacking.&quot; Coal has been lying six months for lack of transport. The collapse is emphasised by the collateral failure of the iron methods of compulsory labour and labour organisation, which have led to wholesale desertions of the towns and industrial areas. Meanwhile, vast hordes of wretched people are drifting to the Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus in search of food, robbing the population, and leaving whole provinces of Central Russia a desert. Moscow&apos;s orders forbidding emigration southward and recommending Siberia are ignored.Moscow sends out a message stating that in order to carry on the State seed plan, 220,000,000 poods of seed arc required. The Connnis-sariat of Land has, however, only 22,500,000 poods of seed at its disposal. A general famine is threatened unless the deficiency in seed can be met. Owing to the disorganisation of transport it is impossible to bring seed from the bread regions. Tho usual system of compulsory deliveries is indicated as the only way out.Moscow attributes tho fuel crisis to the non-realisation of the estimates of the yields of coal and oil, mainly from the Don basin. A monthly deficit of 10,000,000 poods on the estimated monthly yield is reported ; of the 256,000,000 poods of oil stored only 150,000,000 poods could be transported to the Volga. If the situation is to be improved the Donetz coal basin must be restored, and this can only be done by the mobilisa-tion of the entire population, and with the co-operation of the Trade Unions.Certain reports affirm that the great majority of the Red soldiers are hostile to the Soviet authorities. The peasants in the villages refuse food to the soldiers, but they give whatever they can afford to a man who proclaims himself a deserter.   A partial demobilisation is now in
progress, and men over the age of 35 are being sent home an action which will increase rural discontent, since the requisitions have left the peasants with grain only sufficient to feed their own families. In con-nection with this demobilisation a notice issued to demobilised lied Army men is interesting. This exhorts the soldiers not to break the ties binding them to the Army, to report irregularities and abuses, and what can be done to assist agriculture. Other classes in which discontent is reported to be simmering are the sailors, whose attitude is undoubtedly causing grave anxiety to the authorities, and the students, who are offended by a new decree placing all instruction on a basis of communist ideas. Projected demonstrations and a siriko by the students were foi-biddeit under severe penalties.The newspaper &quot; Pravda &quot; has been denouncing the corruption and robbery on the Russian railways. Whole trtickloads and even trainloads of coal are said to disappear, and the thieves to include Red commissars. Moscow admits that the critical transport situation has compelled the shutting down of about 6,000 versls of railway in order to increase the carrying capacity of the main lines. Snow drifts tire also impeding traffic.A census which has been taken of 22 districts shows an increase of the rural population from 15,386,000 lo 15,910,000, a difference of 583,000, or 3^ per cent. The increase is, however, not general. Both Petrograd and Moscow have lost in three years nearly one-half of their population, and the district towns one-third.Refugees who have reached Finland from Russia bring with them terrible stories of juvenile depravity. The Bolsheviks are at pains to instil communism into the children ; moral education lakes care of itself. The children play such games as &quot;shooting prisoners&quot; and &quot;Chresvy-chaika&quot;and talk of slaughtering the bourgeoisie. The immorality in the Soviet schools is appalling. Boys and girls arc found sleeping together, and there are even cases in which children of 12 have become pregnant.The present plight of the Tolstoys casts a vivid light on conditions in Russia. Yasnaya Polyana, Tolstoy&apos;s house, is falling into ruin, though there is eternal talk of repairs. Countess Taiiana Tolstoy, the author&apos;s daughter, is a worker at Yasuaya Polyana ; she is engaged to show her fathers private room to strangers. To obtain food she is obliged to sell clothing and other things which she ami her daughter make themselves. Countess Sasha, another of Tolstoy&apos;s daughters, has been sent to prison by the Bolsheviks for three years. She has been deprived of her estate and robbed of everything else. Count Sergius and his wife live in Moscow in great poverty. They have sold nearly everything for food, and last winter were burning furniture for fuel.The plans of Mr. H. G. Wells and a number of scientific and learned personalities in England who have formed a society for furnishing Russian-savants with books, have been much disturbed by rumours of the nationalisation of libraries and books in Russia.The Bolsheviks and Education.The Bolshevik press is reported latterly to have been considerably annoyed by what it calls &quot;the unlimited political childhood of the Russian students.&quot; The last elections of members of the Petrograd Soviet discovered that most of the students have no settled political opinions, liven at Moscow most of the students seem to call themselves socialists without party an action described as abominable in a University paid by the Soviets. ... , .................   ........
The situation of the 5th Moscow High Technical School is reported to be very critical. No food is forthcoming ; the students are starving and are constantly called upon to join the lied Army. The professors receive neither food nor pay, and altogether it looks as if higher education would soon stop. On the other hand, another report mentions that in Russia until now open enemies of the Soviet power attend and teach in the Universities unhindered, and take academic rations, which are two and three times as big as those of the Rods, and profit by all kinds of privileges at the expense of poverty and privation to others. &quot;Even &quot; now Tsarist Divines are still preaching from the pulpits ; in two or three &quot; years, however, our professorship will be a &apos; Red &apos; one.&quot; A project for the schools has been drawn up for creating a lied professorship and an institute for Economic Construction of the R.S..F.S.R. Lately, apparently, there has been a dispute about the role of tho Professors&apos; Union ; on the one hand are Lenin and ZinovielT, and on the other Trotsky and Bucharin, with Preborajensky at the Centre.Military Movements.Reliable Soviet sources arc responsible for the information that representatives of Communist parties in the countries adjacent to Russia have been invited to Moscow to discuss how far these countries arc prepared for invasion by the Red Army, and wdiat measure of internal help an invading Rod Army may expect, in order to overthrow their Governments by the spring of 1921. German Communists have declared that a lied advance on Posen or the boundaries of pre-war Germany will mean that German Communists will be compelled to defend Posen as German territory. Communists in Poland, Hungary, and Iioumania are, however, confident that by the spring their organisations will be strong enough to overthrow the respective Governments, and to help the invading Red Army. Just now the Soviet is carefully studying the Communist organisations in roumania. Released German prisoners report that there is a special concentration against Roumania, and support is awaited from Hungary and Bulgaria. There is also a scheme to attack Czecho-Slovakia.Communists in Sofia are sketching plans of Russian attacks next spring. These imply that Bessarabia will first be attacked and conquered, and afterwards the Dobroudja, which victories are expected to coincide with revolutions in lioumania and Bulgaria, Roumania will not be invaded. The objective will then be Constantinople, and a junction will be made with the Kemalists and the Bolshevik forces from the Caucasus. Every -thing in Bulgaria is said to have been arranged in accordance with secret orders from &quot;Moscow. Commissaries have been nominated and the leaders have received full instructions.General Kameneff was reported late in January as about to leave for his headquarters at Tultschin in order to supervise personally tho concentra-tion on the Roumanian frontier. 25 divisions are to be sent there, including some of Budenny&apos;s cavalry. Levandovsky&apos;s troops, which are operating in the Caucasus, have received reinforcements from the Crimea, and some Kuban Cossacks ; large reinforcements have been sent to Kemal Pasha. Strenuous efforts are being made to reinforce the districts considered important by Trotsky. As to Germany, Gai, the Bolshevik cavalry commander, has returned to Moscow from internment there, and has reported to Trotsky that most of the interned troops favour the Soviet and can readily bo incorporated when they return to Russia. Trotsky&apos;s plans for new movements of troops have been adopted, after Trotsky resigned his position as commissary for transport to supervise personally the execution of his plans.
i. A Ukniinian-Galician Committee, in contact with Moscow, has been formed in Rovno, and is working for the union of Eastern galicia with the Ukraine. Thanks to tho hatred of the Gahcians for tho Poles, the elections in Eastern galicia will in all probability turn in Russia&apos;s favour. The Ukrainiau-Galician Red Army is meanwhile reported to bo moving to the Galiciau frontier, whither Budenuy&apos;s cavalry has been transferred. The presence of Bela Kun, who is Budenuy&apos;s political commissar, and other Hungarian Communists in Budenny&apos;s quarters, may be taken to foreshadow a possible attack on Galicia aud Hungary.Trotsky is reported to have sent secret orders to the army commanders, asking them to compel all strangers serving with the Red Army, as volunteers, officers, or workers, to change their foreign names foi Russian names. A knowledge of the Russian language is made obligatory, and no stranger is to be admitted to the stalls or permitted to work on secret military missions, except on the special recommendation of the Supreme Military Council. Nothing confidential should be entrusted to Poles.Miscellaneous.Moscow reports that, at the request of the trades unions of several countries, the London International of Red Trade Unions, which was to take place on May 1st, is definitely postponed to July 1st at Moscow.Theodore Rothstein, who is going to Persia as Bolshevik represen-tative, will apparently start on his travels in royal style. Writing to his son Andrew, he likens his party to a comet with a small head and a very long tail. Rothstein&apos;s staff appears to include not less than 600 people -domestics, chauffeurs, couriers, telegraph operators, a sentry, &amp;c.Moscow is reported to be organising the unemployed in Europe and America with a view to sympathetic action on the start of the SoviePs spring offensive.Moscow Communists have addressed a fiery message to &quot; our coura-gcous and valiant sister in arms, the militant comrade Sylvia Pankhurst,&quot; who has been &quot; condemned to the galleys.&quot;Only one Communist was elected at the recent elections for the Kieff Workmen&apos;s Council. The Central Executive Committee found a way out by declaring the elections invalid, and arresting many non-Communist workmen, including the secretary of the Central Bureau of the Menshevik Professional Union.FINLAND.Political.The Bolshevik diplomatic delegation, of 23 persons iu all, has now arrived in Helsingfors.There seems to be very little foundation for recent stories of a forth-coming Red rising, which were set about by the Right parties, who think the Government is becoming too lenient to the Reds, and by tho press. Some trouble at Bjyneborg was quelled by Government troops. On one man, who had been seeking to set up Red propaganda agents in the villages of Southern Finland, were found the detailed plans of a rising. These, like other papers seized, went to show that no rising was to be attempted until a similar movement had started and prospered in Ger-many. Money has been reaching the Communists from various foreign countries.
It is reported that the Lower Court of Appeal has sentenced 14 of the founders of the Loft Socialist Party to four years&apos; imprisonment, The President and Secretary of the Party, as well as all its organs, are being prosecuted.Communist Tactics.The Finnish Communists appear to be putting into practice the so-called &quot; three-men &quot; system, a system which has some kinship with the &quot;germ-cell &quot; system instituted by the Communists in Germany. One absolutely reliable Communist is chosen from each area and entrusted with tho work of forming a net. He chooses two assistants who do not know each other, to work independently, and submit separate reports to their leader. These assistants in their turn take two assistants, who also do not know each other, and submit their information to their respective leaders. Tlie Communists are trying to create a large organi-sation of this kind. It makes for security in that each member only knows his direct chief, and unreliable members know nothing but the identity of their direct officers. Spocial precautions are taken to ensure that only convinced Communists obtain membership of those groups. The special work of the groups is to pay particular attention to the activities of the Schutz Corps, its chiefs and members, with a special regard to the addresses of the leaders, so that they may easily be done away with in the event of a revolution.The Communists Jantunen and Manermaa have returned from Sweden and reported that their visit was successful. The arms and ammunition that they were charged with procuring are stored near the Finnish frontier. Some will bo smuggled into Finland in small quantities ; about three-quarters will como by sea when navigation reopens.Baltic States. ESTHONIA.It is reported that the present staff of the delegation at Reval is to be replaced by an entirely new one from Russia. The appointment of Litvinoff to Reval should, according to information received by the Danish Communists, be considered in conjunction with the expulsion of Martens from America. It is stated that Litvinoff has been ordered to negotiate with the Esthouiah Government a freer use of Reval Harbour. Concessions are offered in return. The Soviet want at Roval an energetic man who can maintain communications with America and get into touch with American financiers and business men who come to Reval. Litvinoff was never in better favour than now, and has very large powers with regard to the establishment of economic relations with Denmark and Norway. There is no truth in the rumours that the Soviet has decided to investigate his actions while in Scandinavia.From the moment of LilvinofPs arrival a recrudescence of secret activities on the part of the Communists in Reval appears to have been noticed. The work is reported to have been gaining ground, and rumours connect it with projected internal disturbances in March. Persons on the spot fear that Esthonia is being drawn once more into political warfare and that its peaceful existence has been shattered.Litvinoff certainly appears to give himself the airs of a grand seigneur; no sooner had he reached Reval than he began to give dinners to Esthonian Ministers and representatives of the industrial and com-mercial world.   Both at these and at the more intimate repasts with his
friends and colleagues in the restaurant &quot; russia,&quot; the wine hill is reported to be large. Of his nationals whom the Esthouian Government catches in tho act of working in favour of Soviet Russia, Litvinolf demands the release on a promise to return them to Moscow. Hitherto tho Government has stood firm. 70 arrested Communists are now reported to be on the point of trial, and to include Russians who have crossed the frontier to organise extraordinary secret commissions in Esthonia. Litvinoff has already made one representation to the Esthouian Government on the subject ; it will be interesting to note how he deals with the present case.The Esthouian police are said to have arrested, at Reval, Ziuovieffs adjutant, Lasareff, who was on his way with his wife to England and America. Lasareff announced that he was an actor, but his real purpose was propaganda work a fact which goes to prove statements that Moscow is using actors as agents. The pair tire being returned to Russia. The police have also unearthed another Communist organisation in Esthonia, and have arrested 20 of its members.It is reported that Diamidi, a Greek, at present private secretary to Jofle at. Riga, is to succeed Axelrod at Kovno. The bribery by Axelrod of various Lithuanian officials and consequent trouble between the Soviet and the Lithuanian Government have brought about the recall of Axelrod.Through the Russian Soviet Government the Ukrainian Soviet Republic is seeking to make peace with Esthonia. Esthonia suggests negotiations at Moscow.LATVIA.Bolshevik propaganda in Latvia has taken a new and ingenious form. Letts holding good positions in Russia have been encouraged to return to Latvia, the Bolsheviks well knowing the difficulty of finding employment there. Workless or in indifferent jobs, and at the end of their resources, the returned Letts become apostles of Bolshevism and praise Russia as a laud where there is no unemployment, since everybody has to work. This propaganda is especially effective in Li ban, which has had no experience of Bolshevik rule.The Bolshevik delegation is reported to have stopped sending pro-paganda pamphlets by post. The Bolsheviks contemplate setting up a printing press in Riga, officially for printing school and scientific hooks, &amp;c.The Bolsheviks are also disbanding their Lettish Rifle Regiments and returning the men to Latvia, Avhere they are usually promptly mobilised by: the Letts. Many of these Letts are ardent Bolsheviks and naturally propagandists. These work at undermining discipline. The officers, who arc most of them narrow-minded, seem to believe that their men are free from Bolshevist taint, which is only the ease with two or three regiments.It is reported meanwhile from another quarter that the army appears ou the whole to be soundly resisting Communist propaganda. Its special branches particularly will stand by the Government and defend the country against Bolshevik aggression to the end.When the Social Democrats recently declared a general holiday in commemoration of certain casualties which occurred during the revolution of 1905, all industrial establishments in the Riga district, except four, carried on work as usual. At one mill, whoro delegates had been chosen to present to the management the workers&apos; views on ecouomic points,
the workers, a few days after the strike, decided to do away with their delegates, to deal individually with tho management, and to denounce their delegates as Bolshevik agitators who should he expelled from I jatv i a, The decisions were acted upon, and the delegates were arrested as Bolshevik agitators.The Lettish and the Esthonian High Commands are reported to have been negotiating on the measures to he taken should a Bolshevik invasion occur in the near future. Latvia will put her whole force of 15,000 men in tho field, and Esthonia will offer 12,000 men. It is said that since tho front is too long for their small army to hold, the Letts would be obliged to retire from the Dvina to the line along the Windau, and there make a stand, which would give time to prepare for further operations.The farmers&apos; (Agrarian) and labour parties have been having preliminary negotiations regarding tho formation of a Coalition Govern-ment. The Agrarians want private ownership of laud to be guaranteed. It is understood that General Ilaidoner will not accept the Premiership. Tho Labour Party will probably appoint the President.LITHUANIA.The relations of the Dutch Consulate with the Soviet Mission are reported to be intriguing the Lithuanian authorities. Axelrod and Ivanov (Chief of Chancellery of the Mission) have paid several rather lengthy visits to the Consulate, apparently to discuss trade relations and prospects.It is reported that the British attitude cn the Vilna and Lithuanian questions has made it difficult for the French to satisfy the Poles upon either. Negotiations during&apos; Marshal PilsudskPs visit to Paris are therefore believed to have avoided the point, and to have been confined to the question of the alliance of the countries lying between Germany ami Russia, and to military matters.In December the trial took place, in camera, of certain members of the Polskaia Organisazia Voionuaia (P.O.W.), which was accused, with its branch, the Organisazia Strelkev Nadnemanskih (O.S.N.), of trying to overthrow the Lithuanian Government and to unite Lithuania with Poland. The accused denied that they wished to unite tho two countries, but admitted that they intended to overthrow the Government and to form a Polish-Lithuanian-White-Rutheniau State, including the provinces of Vilna and Grodno. An armed revolt was prepared in August 1919, but the Lithuanian Government foiled the plot. 116 persons are accused, of whom 43 have escaped. Lithuanian society was on the was on the whole indifferent to the case, and pointed out that the prisoners of the Poles in Vilna might share the fate of the prisoners in Kovno.POLAND.The Peace Negotiations.The unwillingness of both sides to give in seems to prevent the conclusion of the peace negotiations at Riga. There is evidence that the negotiations have been spun out on the instigation of Kopp and other Communist agents in Berlin with the idea that continually deferred hopes of peace might cause a revolution in Poland.Speaking in the Diet late in the month the Premier has explained that the conclusion of peace with Russia is held up solely for an under-standing between the Soviet Delegation and the Government. The Soviet Government was procrastinating on economic questions and trying to minimise its engagements. The Diet passed a vote of confidence in the Government by a large majority.
Economic.The critical food situation, aggravated by official incompetence, was reported early in January as being used by the political parties for their own ends. The country does not want to help tho towns, and the peasants are opposed to the action of the Government in requisitioning surplus food in districts which have escaped Bolshevik devastation.There is much unemployment, and industry is practically dead, owing to lack of transport and eoal, the falling exchange, and tho political chaos. Demobilisation is likely to increase the present evils. The demands for higher wages and the economic strikes play their part in sending up prices.Sanitary conditions, bad everywhere, are said to be unspeakable in the Lemberg district. The towns are indescribably dirty. The typhoid epidemic is proving difficult to defeat.Miscellaneous,Maximilian Horwicz, the chief Soviet agent in Poland, is reported to have absconded from the Demby Camp, near Cracow, on January 6th.A Polish Jewish conference held iu Warsaw late in December had no result, because it was considered that the Jewish demands were impossible and would create a Jewish realm in a Polish state. A conference of the &quot; Bund &quot; decided that all Jewish radical associations in the West should do their best to influence the workers to join the Third International.5. BALKAN AND EAST EUROPEAN STATES.GREECEFollowing the resignation of the War Minister, M. Gounaris, the Ballis Cabinet has given up office, and has been succeeded by a ministry headed by M, Calogeropoulos.The middle of the month Avas signalised by general uneasiness and extensive labour troubles. The gas and electric light, tramway aud electric railway workers came out in Athens, and the trouble spread to the provinces. Against tho Governments throats to use force labour was stolidly defiant.JUGO-SLAVIA.The party of Radio, with whom the Hungarians and pro-Hungarian Croats would seem to have considerable influence, does not seem to be greatly minded to modify its recalcitrant attitude, liadic has informed the Communists, who suggested a joining of forces, that though they agreed upon a republic their interests were totally divergent on the most important point of his programme the right of the peasants to the ownership of land.The miners&apos; strike at Trbolje Avas settled high-handedly by a ministerial decree ordering the immediate payment of the same Avages as iu the State mine at Belegne, and commanding the miners to restart Avork at once avIicu the company had fulfilled the conditions. Under the influence of Petakovitch, strike leader and Communist member for 0. as 8718 iE
Belgrade, the miners made some demur. As a consequence Petakovitch was expelled from Slovenia.&apos;BULGARIA.Communist Activities.It is reported that the Communist leaders will not attempt an independent revolution in Bulgaria, hut will hide the outbreak of revolution in other countries. The &quot; Iskra &quot; group (the left wing of the Communists) is calling lor a revision every six months of the member-shin of the Communist Party. The organ of this party complains that scarcely 50 to GO per cent, of the old members gave in declarations when the consus was taken in December, tho remainder refusing either because they had left the party or were disappointed with what the party was doing.The Communists appear to have divided Sofia into about 20 sections, and will shortly hold a trial mobilisation to lest party discipline and efficiency, Exactly how this mobilisation can be worked is unknown. It is said that there is a &quot;corporal &quot; in charge of every 10 men. What is certain is thai a considerable number of officers and non-commissioned officers of I he Reserve are now Communists. Many of the younger men left the &quot; Union of Reserve Officers&quot; to join them, and this union is now said to have diminished, in Sofia, to some 400 members, chiefly senior.The Communists have lately been organising so-called &quot; Red Weeks,&quot; when tradesmen are mobilised to help the poor. in Doupnitsa the Communists relieved the poor by imposing the whole burden of local taxation on the richer inhabitants. One man alone was asked to dis-burse 120,000 leva for cleaning the town. The authorities prohibited the &quot; Red Week &quot; which the Union of Communist Youth was to have celebrated in memory of tho deaths of Liebknecht and Rosa Luxembourg.The Revolutionary Intellectual Union of Bulgaria has declared its intention of supporting the Russian Soviet and all revolutionary attempts in Europe. The Intellectuals maintain that all counter-revolutions against the proletariat will be opposed in the first place in Bulgaria, and in the Balkans. The union will join Moscow in fighting the Second International and all its followers.The Communist Municipal Councillors of Sofia, who number 11 out of BO, are said to have threatened to resign in order to force a fresh election of the Council, find so possibly increase their numbers.Anti-Communist Action.The authorities tire showing some curiosity regarding the Communists. They have raided a meeting of Russian Communists at the Communist Club, and arrested about a dozen Russians, who are to be deported. It is said that Major Y/aukofl&apos;, reported to be a son of YankolF Pasha, who led the Macedonian revolution of 1902, was also arrested.Ostensibly as a measure to relieve the housing shortage, but really its a measure againt Communism, the Ministry of the Interior has forbidden tho use of more than one building in each town or village for political parties or organisations.PoliticalOn his return in January Stambolisky had a favourable reception, which shoAved some signs of prearrangeinent.   On his journey ho made
,    395ROUMANIA.The Roumanian Socialist Party has gone the way of the rest, and split on the Third International issue. The Communists and the Social Democrats have formed separate parties. Since the return, in fact, of the party deputation from Moscow, there has been a deadlock in the Roumanian Socialist Party. The Party Congress on May 6th will finally choose between the Internationals of Moscow and Amsterdam.Delegates from the Roumanian and Russian Governments are to meet to discuss the programme of the Conference ultimately to be held between the two countries. Litvinoff is the Russian delegate, and the Soviet suggests Reval as the meeting place, &quot;seeing that it would be incon-&quot; venient for the Russian representative in present circumstances to leave &quot; Reval.&quot;Tho Russian Soviet Government has been complaining to Roumania that bands in the Ukraine have started insurrectionary movements on the Bcssavabian frontier, using Bessarabian territory as their base. Roumania is alleged to protect, not to oppose, these movements.General Haller, when on a mission to Bucharest, was told that the King of Roumania would not countenance even an agreement with Budapest, and, wdiile he will not have his country united with the Little Entente, wishes to maintain friendly relations with it, and to avoid anything that Avould lead to conflict.6. NEAR EASTERN STATES. TURKEY. The Treaty : Relations with Russia.In the negotiations at the London Conference both Turkish delcga-tions based their actions on the principle of regarding Russia as a natural ally. In her utterances to Moscow, Turkey considers herself&apos; the ally of Soviet Russia in so far as both countries are fighting the same enemy and are endeavouring to free the Eastern nations from Western Imperialism. She and the governments of the Near Eastern Republics have sent an important mission to Moscow as a set-off to her delegations negotiating in London, where she wishes to demonstrate the removal of the last obstacles to communication between the National Assembly and the Russian Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.Mustapha KemaPs intransigent policy is the consequence of his belief that important sections of European public opinion, including the French and Italian Governments, demand a modification of the Sevres Treaty,e 2various speeches from the train, in one of which he declared that Poland and Roumania would soon he allied and strong enough to resist the Bolsheviks, and in case of need other armies would support theirs. There has been some vague talk of the advantages of a republic. Indeed, as long ago as last Juno the King is said to have told his Premier that he would not stand in the way of a republic, and more lately, in connection with the return of Constantino, that he could not understand any king returning to his throne after managing to leave it.Reports regarding the effect of the prohibition of labour conscription in Bulgaria have not yet been received.
He told the National Assembly, in January that, plans to secure the Eastern Front having met with unhoped-for success, attention should now he concentrated on the West. Meanwhile, in February, Tchitcheriu thought well to stiffen Kemalby a note enlarging on the insincerity of the British proposals for reconciliation, and insisting that the common interests of Turkey and Russia require an indissoluble union. The note urged, at tho same time, that the evacuation of Turkish territory by the Europeans who have been in occupation was essential before negotia-tions could be engaged.Russo-Turkish relations are, however, by no means so smooth as they are being made to appear. A note addressed to Tchitcheiin in January points out that in the Turco- Armenian peace Turkey claims for herself only those provinces with a preponderating Moslem population, A return of these provinces to Armenia, which Turkey hears is a part of Russian policy, is described as a measure which would lead to a massacre of the Moslem population. As regards Georgia, Turkey wishes to know the future intentions of tho Russian Government.The late Talaat Pasha, who was in constant touch with Mustapha Kemal at Angora and with Enver at Moscow, in recent conversation with a reliable informant, laid stress upon his and their real dislike of Russian Bolshevism, and said that Turkey and Great Britain were not industrial rivals, but customers depending upon each other, and that it only lay with His Majesty&apos;s Government to firing to fruition the immediate possibility of peace and development in Asia Minor, provided neither the partition nor the servitude of Turkey was stated or implied. His general thesis was that there was only one civilisation. Turkey to be saved must he civilised. In essentials there was unity between Angora and Constantinople. In proof of this he displayed a letter which he had received from Mustapha Kemal. In Asia Minor and Central Asia there were six republics, some weak, others strong. All were at present Red, but not of a deep shade. Of these, the Moslem republics were naturally influenced by what Turkey did, or affected by what happened to her. In Bokhara, for instance, there was a considerable force, to be developed by British policy for good or for evil. Turkey, still at war with Great Britain, was employing the weapons she hold : propaganda throughout the East and in Turkestan, incitement in India, &amp;c. She was, in fact, undertaking what reprisals were open to her, and enlisting as many peoples as she could against Groat Britain. From the Turkish point of view it was a pity that this policy had not been begun earlier and better organised. Ho compared it in I he political sphere with the cutting of telegraph wires and similar tricks in the military. They might mean very little, but might, again, have serious results.Hatred of Great Britain in Turkey was, Talaat said, only political; there was really more hostility to her amongst the Arabs and Hindus than amongst the Turks. Britain&apos;s ancient friendship for Turkey was not forgotten. He did not even believe there was a genuine hatred of the British Raj by the Indian Moslems, among whom the satisfactory settle-ment of the question of the Caliphate would go far to restore British popularity.To Bolshevism he referred at length, and was constantly returning, in terms of intense dislike, ft might suit Russia not the rest of the world. The human race could not change, to that point at any rate, outside Russia. As long as it stayed within its own border he saw no danger in it for Turkey, nor, indeed, for England. Russians, he thought, were individually good and kind, but in a crowd abominable.   And
Bolshevism was the essence of the Russian crowd. Men wore Bolshevik by conviction, by policy, or by interest. He might be the last ; he was certainly not the first. Alliance with the Bolsheviks was for hini a pure matter of expediency, a weapon which might have to bo used. He had met Trotsky at Brest-Litovsk ; he had a poor opinion of him, and believed that the majority of Russian Jews were degenerates. Euver Pasha, at present in Moscow, he described as neither Right nor Left, but for his country. Halil Pasha, also in Moscow, wras further to the Left. Djemal Pasha was doing propaganda work against Great Britain in Turke3tan.   He himself was, out of patriotism, a liberal.Bolshevism and Islam wero in principle opposed. Referring to the part Pau-Islamism was likely to play iu the future, Talaat expressed the Young Turkish view that Islam was iu itself a grand religion, compatible with civilisation, but, like other religions, susceptible of becoming intolerant and retrograde in the minds of fanatics. Less useful as a fiery torch, though, was the milder, less fanatic creed of the Young Turk.As to Turanianism, he did not see a future for it iu our day, though the events of the past years would have given all those related to it a closer sense of kinship.Of Egypt he spoke casually. He had told Egyptian students in Berlin, in respect of the Milner concessions, &quot;Take what you are ollerod and then ask for more,&quot; and the extremists among them had been angry. Something obviously must be done for Egypt. English promises were long overdue. Our difficulty in fulfilling them was that we had promised so much and with so many contradictions.As to Smyrna, Greece had no title to it. It was Turkish and ought to remain so. All the economic resources of Asia Minor, a rich country crying aloud for development, were at the disposal of Great Britain on one condition, that there should be no financial or military servitude. Why should the Greeks have it ?As regards the Islands, steps of some kind must be taken to see that those immediately adjacent to Turkey were not used for Greek Nationalist propaganda and did not become the sanctuary of Greek comitadjis, A suggestion of compromise with regard to Smyrna he rejected without violence. A similar suggestion with regard to Thrace was rejected, our informant thought, even more formally. He said tho safety of Constan-tinople demanded that Thrace should be Turkish. Regarding Constanti-noplc itself, he believed that internationalisation or neutralisation would probably meet the case. The Greek occupation of tho Dardanelles was useless and provocative. With Russia out of action the question of the Dardanelles all but vanished. In the Balkans he believed that ultimately Serbia and Bulgaria would be driven into an alliance, and that only the most intelligent Greek diplomacy could avoid the many rocks he saw in its path.As to Europe in general, the position in Germany was dangerous. Talaat Pasha believed the French wore determined to go into Germany. He did not think they would get their money. It was more probable that the Germans would join hands with the Bolsheviks, in which case relief might come to Turkey from chaos and disaster in Europe. But he would infinitely prefer to see relief come through the channels of order.Besides, he disliked both Germans and Russians. His relations with the Germans during the war were of the highest importance, but always detestable. On one occasion he had suddenly to deal with an arrange-ment between the Turks and the Germans, come to Avithouthis knowledge ; he found himself completely handcuffed by the Germans, aud said to tho Council of Ministers, &quot; I often wondered why the English ever wanted to fight the Germans.  Now I know.&quot;
Communist Propaganda.The Bolshevik centre at Beicos would appear to be a branch of the Soviet Propaganda Department, and to be managed by Viktoroif and Zilborstoin. It is a centre for Bolshevik couriers arriving in Conslanfi-uople, and a distributing centre for propaganda leaflets, said lo be printed in foreign languages on the premises, its chief present activities lie in maintaining communication with its centre, presumably Batuni. Efforts are made to keep in touch with Anatolia ; a special branch is said to recruit Russians for the Turkish Nationalists. There would also seem to exist in Constantinople an independent Bolshevik-Russo-Jewish organisa-tion. A courier named Shollland was recently arrested bearing a mandate from the Constantinople organisation entrusting him with a special mis-siou to the Crimea. He also carried a certificate from the Grand Rabbi in Constantinople, testifying to his respectability. It has been previously rumoured that the (fraud Rabbi has pro-Bolshevik sympathies and was personally responsible for granting Italian visas to seven Bolshevik agitators proceeding to Trieste.The venizolos Dunia, the official organ of the Communist Party at Angora, has published an article attempting to reconcile Communist principles with Moslem religion. The writer draws a parallel between tho laws of Mohammed and Communism, and ends with the remnrk that all the efforts of the Turkish Communist Party aim at maintaining tranquillity and order, and are based on the equal institutions of the Golden Age a term usually applied to the time of the Prophet.A very large movement of Nationalist agents is reported, from Trebizond, through Datum, Tiflis, and Baku, to the North Caucasus, Persia, Turkestan, and Afghanistan. The agents include many couriers with secret despatches, presumably from headquarters at Angora.Miscellaneous.French policy and influence are being developed in Constantinople. An intense pro-French propaganda has been in progress since the Service (hi Levant was formed in Constantinople. The objects of this prgauiso-tion appear to be to deal with the repatriation of Syrians, the Pan Islamic question, and local political questions. The system of agents lias been organised, and the Press in Syria and Constantinople has been largely subsidised, in order to spread French influence throughout Islam.Turkey would appear to have asked for Italian support of a revision in the Sevres Treaty in return for extensive concessions in Anatolia, both within the zone of Italian influence and other parts of the country. Italy is also to bo asked to furnish financial and material assistance as soon as possible.PERSIA.On February 21st the Kasvin and Hamadan sections of tho Persian Cossack Brigade, numbering between 2,500 and 3,000 strong, marched upon Teheran, where they were joined by some 700 local Cossacks.Riza Khan announced his determination to capture the capital, and stated that they were determined not to be bullied by tho Bolsheviks, and therefore could not allow the existing inefficient Government lo continue in office. They intended to establish a strong administration capable of protecting Teheran after the withdrawal of the British troops, and expressed complete deference to the authority of the Shah, avIio accepted the new regime. Its acceptance later by the Bakhtiaris secured support from the provinces.
Even before this coup British political credit in Persia stood much higher than Russian, The Soviet Government demanded guarantees, before withdrawing its troops from Enzeli, that the British should first withdraw their forces from Persia. The Persian Foreign Office replied (hat as the British had given assurances that they would have evacuated Persia by April 1st, tho Soviet authorities might be certain this would be done. The Persian Foreign Minister at the same time demanded the immediate withdrawal of tho Soviet troops.The doings of tho Gilan Communists were then exciting a good deal of apprehension in the minds of the Persian Government. Bi the Nasiri Straits scouts from the Gilan Communist regiments ordered the local authorities to load up certain Russian ships with stores of rice, &amp;c, which were then transported to Baku and Resht. The Persian Govern-ment notified the Soviet Government that until Russia insisted upon disarming the Gihiu Communists the Persian Government would not be in a position to sanction their proceedings by sending a governor to the district.It was reported in January from Bolshevik sources that the Persian Socialists and the so-called Iranian Communist Party had joined forces against the Government. The Iranian Party is centred in Baku and has branches throughout the towns of the North Caucasus ; its adherents were said to be rapidly increasing. Bolshevik propaganda was active among the Persians of the Northern Caucasus ami Trans-Caucasia. Early in February the Bolsheviks had set a scheme afoot for the organisation of Persian tribes in the south of Azerbaijan to attack Ardebil. They are taking steps to corrupt the leaders of the tribes on the Persian coasts, and have asked the Bolshevik organisation in Rostov on Don for half a million roubles to do it with. Certain Bolshevik troops in Persia were then reported to bo badly clothed, almost without boots, and to be hardly fit for action. The transfer of personnel to Labour Armies appears to lie affecting Bolshevik strength in Persia. A Bolshevik attack on the outposts of the British forces in North-west Persia was repulsed with loss in a vigorous counter-attack.Theodore Rothstein is taking with him to Persia, as adviser to tho Bolshevik Mission, T. Kousovkov, late professor of political economy at Moscow University. His delegation is reported to have been on the point of leaving Moscow for Teheran at the beginning of February. How far recent events may have affected their plans does not yet appear,SYRIA.Early in January the labour troubles at Jaffa, with which the &quot;Maflaga Poalein Socialem&quot; (the left wing of &quot; Poale Zion &quot;) and a communist party following the Third International had much to do, were reported to have been settled. This body works at organising the Jewish workers of Palestine for the social revolution ; it controls a club called the &quot; Boruchoff Club,&quot; with headquarters in Jaffa and branches in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Galilee. Its present membership is reported to be about 300, chiefly inexperienced immigrants. As a result of the Jaffa agitation some persons wore arrested, but subsequently released. The general result seems to have been the formation of a &quot; Federation of Jewish Workmen,&quot; in which the moderate parties overwhelmingly preponderate.Quantities of Bolshevik propaganda, printed in Yiddish, Hebrew, Arabic, and English, and inciting the peoples of Palestine to throw off the
British and proclaim an independent state, are reported to have been transported during the last few weeks to Palestine, via Austria and Trieste.7. CENTRAL ASIATIC STATES.NORTHERN CAUCASUS.The successes of the North Caucasus insurgent groups have driven the Bolsheviks to special repressive measures. Thus, Ossoiin and Cossack tribes found guilty of aiding &quot; White-Green &quot; insurgent bands are liable to deportation, the deportees being replaced by elements more reliable in Bolshevik eyes. There have been several such deportations ; nevertheless risings continue incessantly, but make no progress, owing to lack of co-operation and of a common&apos; leader. The provinces of Daghestan ami of the llillmen have been proclaimed independent Soviet Republics, in the hope of placating the tribes sufficiently to slop tho insurrections.GEORGIAAdvices wore received in Constantinople on February 18th of the invasion of Georgia by Armenian and Azerbaijan troops, in conjunction with Red Armenians, the Armenians attacking from tin; south and the Azerbaijanis on the East Georgian frontier. Un the 19th the Georgians were said to bo resisting, but their situation was considered desperate. The British and French Missions had left Tiflis, and the government had installed itself at Batum. On the 23rd it was reported that the Georgians had checked the Bolshevik onslaught, and that Tiflis was for the moment safe. The invading forces include three divisions of the Bolshevik 11th Army, the whole available Armenian army, and many Azerbaijan Tartars. Russia gives as reasons for the attack, in the first place the refusal to evacuate the Bortchalo district, and in the second certain drastic but legitimate measures taken to suppress Communist agitation. The invasion was accompanied by a Communist outbreak at Tiflis, and the proclamation of a Soviet administration by the Bolsheviks. On the 26th, advices from Constantinople announced the fall of Tiflis on the previous day and the retirement on Kutais of the Georgian forces before what the Georgians themselves described as the entire Soviet forces in the Caucasus, Russian, Azerbaijan, and Armenian. It was reported that a Tartar Bolshevik force was advancing along the coast road towards Batum, while a body of Tartars was advancing towards the same objective from the south.Bolshevik plans for a coup d&apos;etat in Georgia have for long been maturing in characteristic fashion. The temporary failure of these plans and the consequent dismissal of Sehiemann, the Soviet representative in Georgia, were dealt with in last month&apos;s report. Where Sehiemann failed, however, his successor, Stark, succeeded. The failure of the Georgian Army before Tiflis was due to the outbreak of disturbances, leading to anarchy, of which he was the instigator. Previously Soviet representa-tives at Tiflis were working Bolshevik agents into every corner of the country, and have been forming strong Communist parties in all large centres, paying special attention to young people and creating a &quot; Union of Communist Students &quot; and a &quot; Union of Workmen&apos;s and Peasants&apos; Youth.&quot; The country was described as covered with Communist &quot; embryos,&quot; conducting a clandestine agitation.   This propaganda had /
won a certain number of supporters, with the help of whom Bolshevik agents were elected to trado unions and other workmen&apos;s organisations.Messages early iu January described the onergetic action of tho Government in deporting and imprisoning local Communists. They were reported then to have the situation woll in hand, hut to be unable to stem the rise of Bolshevism, which regime nearly 75 per cent, of tho peasants were said to favour. Moslem help, when sought for, appeared elusive, and the general feeling among the Moslems was reported, not too reliably, to be anti-Bolshevik.Late in January, after a threat of war from Tillis, the Government of Azerbaijan made some pretence of consenting to supply Georgia with the promised oil and to release the Georgian train crews arrested at Baku. The arrangement was that 25 Russian ships interned in Georgian ports should be surrendered to the Bolsheviks and certain imprisoned Communists should be released.Turkey, it was said, would maintain strict neutrality should the Bolsheviks attack Georgia. Meanwhile, throughout the country Bol-shovik aud Kemalist intelligence agents were described as jealously Watching each other, and Kiazim Bey, the Nationalist representative in Tillis, while doing his best to persuade Georgia of the peaceful intentions of Mustapha Kemal, was active in counter-Bolshevik pro-paganda among the Moslems of Trans-Caucasia and the Northern Caucasus.AZERBAIJAN.Though the Bolshevik press continues to paint roseate pictures of the felicity of Soviet administration, it is reliably reported that things in Azerbaijan are very unsettled, and that only a policy of relentless terror prevents a general revolt. Disillusionment is general. The six-hour working day has vanished, aud factory hands must work 12 hours daily. Nevertheless industry declines, and the closing down of the oilfields is not far distant. Even in Baku kerosene is very short. The Allies, and particularly Great Britain, are blamed for these troubles, and a violent anti-British propaganda rages.In spite of heavy repression, anti-Bolshevik feeling is very strong among the Moslems, who look hopefully to the arrival of Mustapha KemaPs forces. The Soviet authorities, who fear a liaison between the Baku Moslems and the Turkish Nationalists, distrust all their movements.Before the projected invasion of Georgia early in February some new Russian units were reported to have appeared iu Azerbaijan. The infantry, generally speaking, were described as badly equipped aud of low moral ; the cavalry aud &quot;special&quot; detachments were well clothed, of higher heart, and bellicose, because, going ahead, they got the best of the loot. The troops talked chiefly of the anticipated invasion of Georgia aud the sack of Tiflis.ARMENIA.The absence of the Armenian forces fighting against the Georgians enabled the Dashnak (Nationalist) Party to execute a successful coup Wetat at Erivan on February 19th. The Armenian Soviet Commissars were arrested, aud a Dashnak Provisional Government is in power.On their occupation of the Kars district and of Alexandropol in November the Turks are said to have deported to Erzerum all male Armenians of military age.  &quot; The fate of the deportees is not known,
but it is understood that they arc not exposed to any danger.&quot; The Armenian Soviet Government is said to have asked the Turks to repatriate the deportees,TURKESTAN.According to Moscow, White Guard Generals and Atamans are again raising White Guard hands against Turkestan. Sokolnikoff&apos;, the head of tho Red Army in Turkestan, has reported to Moscow the organisation in the Semiretjc district of a White centre, which directs all rebellions in Turkestan. Tho revolt is spreading rapidly, and tho peasants are killing Bolshevik propagandists. Sokolnikolf&apos; asks for fresh instructions and important reinforcements.Three hundred and ten organisations, two-thirds of them Mnhoinmedan, are said to have been represented at the second Turkestan Communist Congress of Youths at Tashkent, and to have professed themselves willing to undertake propaganda in the East and to join in a Red war.AFGHANISTAN.The Commissar Bravin, who was head of tho first Bolshevik Mission in Kabul in 1919, is reported to have been murdered at Ghazni. lie had remained in Afghanistan since his supersession by Suritz.The Commissar Rosenberg, late of the Moscow Foreign Office, was believed late in January to be en route for Kabul to take part in the advanced centre of Soviet propaganda for India.Suritz, tho Bolshevik envoy in Afghanistan, was receiving reports early in February from an agent who had made a tour in Northern and Central India, and had discussed revolutionary matters with leaders of various illegal organisations. The agent indicated that as a result of the tactics of Congress, revolutionary ardour was growing cold among the masses of the population. He reported lack of men, money, and central organisation, and urged the establishment of a printing press in India itself and the preparation of lists for propaganda. He also urged the carrying on of work in the army, especially among junior Indian officers, and the subvention of frontier disturbances. The agent stated that influential people were willing to join the organisation. His whole programme was estimated to take several years and to cost 50,000/. for the first. Surilz applied to Moscow for sanction for this expenditure, and advised his agent to remain in India meanwhile.The Amir has appointed Djemal Pasha, ex-Commanding Officer in Palestine, to command the Afghan Army of the South, in which, according to Moscow, 15,000 British Indian emigrants are said to have enrolled. 50 Turkish officers arc roportcd to be with Djemal.8. FAR EASTERN STATES. SIBERIA.In December a considerable anti-Communist movement was reported in Western Siberia. The movement was stimulated by the mobilisation carried out by tho Siberian Revolutionary Committee and headed by the Peasants&apos; Union and the Tribal Self-Governments. The Tribal organisa-tions did most of the work, while the Peasants&apos; Union undertook organisation in the interior;   The Peasants&apos; Union, which began to
organise before Koltchak&apos;s downfall, is now scattered about every government except that of Tobolsk. Efforts at unity and expansion are being made, though, despite the arrival from abroad of 80,000 rilles, brought from the Japanese and other allies, money and arms are reported to be lacking. The efforts of the Social Revolutionaries to form unions for the peasants fail, owing to their unpopularity. It is reported that should unity Ik; attained a general rising may be expected in May, If the peasants tail of unity the movement will be suppressed piecemeal. 60 per cent, of the country population tire said to favour the movement, find GO to 70 per cent, of the male peasants joined the insurrections in places in which they occurred. The; Kirghiz organisation, Alashorda, well supplied with funds find firms, abounds in the Semipalptinsk governments.Moscow admits that the introduction of compulsory labour in Western Siberia, more especially for wood-cutting, is a complete fiasco, There are not enough troops to compel the peasants to work. The peasants ignore Soviet orders to increase the area of cultivation.From Chita it was reported in December that Krasnoslehekov, alias Tobelson, continued to reign without change of policy, though Nikiforov Wiis said to be gaining power. Tho pro-Parliament in Vladivostok had not been dismissed a Bolshevik move which destroyed the excuse for a reactionary coup (Vctat, to which, however, the indecision of the Japanese was the chief obstacle. Meanwhile the local Zemstvo had renounced its authority as the governing body ; the council of ministers had resigned, and a new council of administrators had been formed from Communists and peasant representatives.More recently the Communists appear to have swept the Far Eastern Republic in the elections for the Constituent Assembly a fact which has naturally rejoiced Moscow.Fatly in February, Moscow reported that the remaining White Guards in Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Amur region were again stirring. Baron Ungern, now a Mongolian subject, had recruited troops locally and operated successfully against the Chinese troops. The Chinese garrison have evacuated Urgn, which has been more or less invested for three months by a force of some 2,000 &quot; White&quot; Russians under Baron Ungern, a former adherent of Semenolf. The Mongols themselves appear to have been the prime movers in these White Russian operations in Mongolia.In all the Manchurian towns ex-ollieers aro forming detachments under Japaueso patronage. The Ataman Semenolf, whose death was reported, is actually enjoying Japanese hospitality at 1&apos;ort Arthur. Semenolf has announced that he is resinning command of the Russian Far Eastern Army a statement which has been followed by a proclama-tion of Japanese neutrality in regard to Russian domestic politics. The Siberian papers are meanwhile full of an &quot; approaching war &quot; between the Bolsheviks and Japan.CHINA.The conclusion of a pact between Russia and the Chinese Military Mission at Moscow is reported. This pact contains clauses guaranteeing Soviet support of China against attack, joint action by the two powers against forces creating disturbances in the frontier areas, the right of Russia to send armed forces through Chinese territory, freedom of action for Russia on the North-east Indian Frontier, and permission for the Soviet Government to send postal matter, books, &amp;c., into China.
The Pekin Government is still at loggerheads with the Sun Yat-Sen party, which has formed an &quot;Extraordinary&quot; Government at Canton and controls several provinces. The future of Sun Yat-Scn would not, however, appear to be rosy. The financial problem is acute, and China is afflicted with large armies which absorb nearly half the Budget, and which the Government seems unable to disband or effectively to control.9. BRITISH COLONIES. CANADA.Unemployment.Unemployment on the whole shows little improvement. In spite of the efforts of the revolutionists to exploit (lie unemployed the danger point seems to have passed, aud on the whole the cut in wages is being accepted philosophically. At a secret ballot of the copper mines in Prince Albert in December 70 per cent, of the men voted for continuing work at lower rates of pay. Tho &quot; Unemployed Committee,&quot; cold-shouldered by labour, revolutionary organisations, and returned soldiers alike, is power-less and fears to take action, and the situation appears to be improving all round, although the efforts of certain extremists are directed towards fostering discontent. Constitutional Relief Agencies are reported to have the situation well in hand.Bitterness was said to be increasing amongst the more radical returned soldiers, a number of whom vowed to take the jobs from foreigners if employment was not forthcoming for themselves.It is said, however, that a record output of coal during the last month, and several important contracts, have made it probable that tho Dunsmuir Collieries may open a new mine and employ more men. The Consolidated Mining and Smelter Companies are working full time, and most of the logging camps in the district are expected soon to be in full swing again. Well-to-do Chinese are reported to have been very charitable to white unemployed men.Extremists.A comprehensive, ably organised scheme for launching an official Communist Party in Canada is reported. The scheme is to be started in Ontario on the Russian model and controlled by Moscow through New York. At a secret Convention of the United Communist Party, which is affiliated with the Third International and represents the more extreme of the two Communist factious, instructions were given to T. J. Bell, an indefatigable agitator, to organise Canada. Eventually, if Bell can manage it, the whole of North America is to bo covered. The whole of the proceedings are in accord with the 21 points and special provision has been made for the formation of an &quot;illegal organisation,&quot; in which members&apos; fees will be used for illegal propaganda. Although at present the plans of the United Communist Party are confined to Toronto and the West, there are groups of avowed Communists working under direct orders from Moscow in Montreal and other towns which may well form nuclei for propaganda, while among foreigners in Eastern Canada and Montreal Isaac MoBride aud his companions, under cover of canvassing for &quot;Medical Relief for Soviet Russia,&quot; preach the tenets of Moscow. Foreign born agitators, however, have shown signs of greater caution sinco the virtual deportation of G. B. Currie, which has had a distinctly salutary effect.
Foreign labour organisations also abound in Western Canada, where the Ukrainians appear to be the most revolutionary bodies and the most opposed to becoming Canadianised. A number of Chinese in Vancouver are reported to become red-hot revolutionists. The \Vorkmen&apos;s Circle, an intensely Bolshevik Jewish Society, proposes to hold its annual convention in Toronto in May.Further evidence has been obtained of underground communist activity from the United States into Eastern Canada, liovenko and his Society for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia in Montreal arc in close touch with the Soviet organisation in New York, for which they receive-orders. A secret convention of the Communist Party lias recently been held at New York, and tho Toronto and Hamilton branches propose to affiliate with the New York organisation. The Hamilton delegates were instructed to insist upon an aggressively &quot; Hod &quot; programme for attempting to convert the organisation of returned men into a Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Council. Martens&apos; representative in the United States is said to be a member of the Buffalo local branch of the Machinists. Money for machinists and carpenters from Toronto to go to work iu Russia was supplied through this man. The journey was made through the States, Mexico aud Japan.Apparently tho Bolsheviks and &quot;Reds&quot; are determined to prevent free speech in Toronto. They have a strong well-organised body of men who attempt to break up meetings of which they disapprove, and tho police have some difficulty in keeping order. Violent speeches were made at a Convention of the Independent Labour Party of Nova Scotia, held at the end of January. Tho organisation, which is both &quot; Rod &quot; and seditious, aims to destroy the International Trades and Labour movement iu tho province, and intends to use any means iu its power to gain the reins of Government.The Socialist Party of Canada iu Vancouver and Winnipeg is displaying increasing tolerance towards revolutionary organisations. There are signs that the 3rd International principles have been insisted upon. It is possible that the Federated Labour Party in British Columbia may develop into a genuine federation of revolutionary bodies, including the Self-Determination for Ireland League.The One Big Union.The decision of the Loggers&apos; Convention in Vancouver to secede from the One Big Union may well prove the death-blow to that organisation. Unfortunately tho former members still retain tho temper which inspired its formation, aud there is a report that the operators may repudiate the agreement made last spring with the Internationals, in which case there would undoubtedly be trouble with tho miners.The Lumber and Camp Workers&apos; Union has decided to secede to the One Big Union, and it is probable that it will drift towards the I.WAV.Miscellaneous.Canadian newspapers quoted with somewhat good-humoured contempt the suggestion of several American senators that Canada, the West Indies and other British Dominions on tho American Continent should bo &quot;freed&quot; from British Government. Tho suggestion apparently emanated from politicians who had no knowledge of the feeling in the British Dominions.
It was recently reported that the Japanese Consul in Vancouver was anxious to obtain popular Labour men who would go to the United States to organise Labour and spread certain propaganda which would be indicated by the Japanese.The report that the Government intend to nationalise the new oil fields appears to bo unfounded. Tho regulations imposed are merely intended to guard the public from &quot; wild-cat &quot; schemes.SOUTH AFRICA.The result of the general election exceeded all expectations as a vindication of General Smuts&apos; policy. Fear of secession wedded parties which at other timos hold entirely different views. The working-men voted against republicanism and not on sectional matters raised by former Labour leaders, while tho Unionists entirely merged their party in the South African Party. The Uert/og policy has been to kcop the Dutch and British elements in South Africa apart, while General Smuts&apos; efforts have been aimed at fusing them into a single South African nation. Undoubtedly the political fusion between Dutch and English is a notable achievement.The lightning strike of the Band miners on the eve of the elections was strongly resented by the public, and contributed largely to the Labour debacle. There was a good deal of intimidation, many of the men being disinclined to strike, and only the threats of the direct actiouists preventing them from returning to work.Tho strike, which originated at the Langlaagte mines, was entirely unauthorised and irregular and in defiance of the executive of the Miners&apos; Union, who held it to be a breach of their agreement with the Chamber of Mines. Unfortunately the extremists&apos; councils prevailed, and a strike extended rapidly. A general strike, however, was vetoed by the ballot of the Mine Workers&apos; Union and all members except those on the Con-solidated Langlaate were instructed to return to work. The workers on the whole realise that reduction in the working costs is necessary if production is to continue.The Chamber of Mines is willing to assent to the special appeal for no victimisation, but insists that disciplinary action must be taken against the men who engineered the strike by intimidation and threats of violence.By February 20th the Rand miners&apos; strike was practically at an end, 95 per cent, of the men having returned to work, signing on as new hands, and thereby forfeiting certain privileges. The Chamber of Mines cancelled the permission to collect union dues granted to the Miners&apos; Union, as the latter had not observed their agreements. The termination of all those existing is under consideration.The question whether mineowners have the right to employ non-union men has now arisen. The Miueowners&apos; Association have issued an ultimatum requiring all members of the Mine or General Workers&apos; Association to sign individually a guarantee admitting the right of the respective managements to engage or dismiss whom they please ; failing signature they would be discharged.A resolution was passed at a Congress of the South African Workers&apos; Bond by the Nationalist clement of the Witwatersrand miners calling on members of the Mine Workers&apos; Union to resign by March 15th and join instead the South African Workers&apos; Bond. A strenuous effort is to be made to consolidate labour throughout South Africa in one big industrial bond,
The welcome of the Cape Corps to Earl Flaig was made an occasion for an organised attack on the police. A large crowd of coloured people, many of them the worse for liquor, showed their dissatisfaction at being unable to enter the hall, which proved too small for the occasion, by stoning the police stationed outside. Shots fired over the heads of the crowd eventually subdued it, but a number of police and coloured people were injured.At a meeting of the Communist League, held in Johannesburg at the end of December, White labour unions and political parties, were advised to support tho efforts of native workers to better their position, since the bulk of tho world workers is composed of native and coloured peoples, who will form the mainstay of tho army which will overthrow capitalism. One of the speakers declared that the &quot; Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot; can never be applied to England, America, &amp;c. He gave as his reason for this statement that unlike Russia they had a large percentage of skilled workers, and these would never consent to be driven to produce, whereas it may well be that it will be necessary to apply Lenin&apos;s system in South Africa to the natives, in order to force production.A huge section of natives, among whom are many intelligent and influential leaders, appear anxious to bring the native races of South Africa more directly under the control of the British Government. Two delegates who came to London in order to place their grievances before the Government have returned from their mission, and are about to tour the country in order to report tho result, while two delegates remain in London. So far the object of their mission has not become clear, but they are being carefully observed by the South African Authority to whom a report will be forwarded at a later date.AUSTRALIA. The Australian Workers&apos; Union.The recent resolution expressing disapproval of Imperial federation passed, by the Annual Convention of the Australian Workers1 Union does not imply hostility to Empire Union in its broadest sense. Labour has passed similar resolutions voicing a fear of the adoption of some scheme involving Australia in entanglements to which she has not consented, and which would restrict the autonomy of the Dominions. The Convention, however, cabled to the British Labour Party urging the withdrawal of British troops from Irish and other fronts, and passed a resolution ad-vocating self-determination for Ireland and other nations.As regards home affairs, the President warned the members against a general strike arising out of the shipping strike and other disputes which would &quot; leave Labour a rabble instead of a solid militant body,&quot; and he strongly advocated arbitration, to which sooner or later all strikers had to submit.The Shipping Strike.The Shipping Strike has ended at long last in a signal defeat of Red policy. At the end of February the seamen agreed to observe the in-violability of industrial agreements and to abandon job control.Underlying the struggle was the whole question of constitutional as against revolutionary method. The employers, though prepared to fight to a finish, deny that they wore endeavouring to smash unionism or reduce wages.  They refused to resume inter-State shipping until an end was
made of the system of &quot; job control &quot; whereby the men suddenly demand, through the ship&apos;s crew committee, the redress of individual grievances or special concessions on a threat of deserting the vessel. Through this &quot;job control &quot; system the Government is said to have lost a quarter of a million during the last twelve months. The Shipping Companies offered to hold a conference when the men returned to work. Ju the end the men waived job control and all other claims except the manning question.The compulsory conference summoned by the President of the Federal Arbitration Court proved useless. A meeting of delegates of the Unions, meanwhile, was considering extremist proposals that all Transport Unions, both on sea and land, should bring transport opera-tions to a standstill and so isolate Victoria. The suggestions included a refusal to ship coal or wheat, proposals to cut all the gas and electrical supplies and stop all services. The Queensland Railwaymen also refused to abide by the decision of the Arbitration Court and voted by a large majority in favour of a strike for increased wages.Meanwhile, the majority of the unemployed, both seamen and others, desired to return to work, while obstinately refusing tho guarantees required by the employers. The extremists were aided and abetted by hooligans, whose violence led to certain ugly incidents, notably the mobbing of Sir Walter Davidson, the Governor of New South Wales, and the attempt to break into Government House in the face of the police. Shortly before tho strike tho shipping depression was noted to bo so serious that one company had reduced its steerage fares from Australia to Hong Kong from 201. to 90*.NEW ZEALAND.&apos; An interesting attempt is being made to solve the labour question by bringing Capital and Labour together to devise a plan whereby both can bo better organised for the purpose of production. Organisers, not theorists, are required, and it is urged that these organisers need not necessarily be wholly or even mainly employers, the men most qualified to advise being men who have already proved their capacity in tho management of huge commercial and industrial undertakings.It is therefore proposed to hold a National Industrial Conference of Employers and Employees to discuss the possibility of establishing a wise co-ordination between the essential services, and a reduction of friction. Recognising the enormous waste, both by duplication and multiplication of services, and by inefficient methods, it is suggested that the Board of Trade should co-operate with the proposed conference to decide &quot;what, plant and other fixed capital in the various essential &quot; services should be scrapped or abandoned with a view to making all &quot; productive and distributive agencies as efficient as possible and avoid &quot; unnecessary waste . . . the value to bo paid for by the State at a &quot; fair valuation, and such payment made a charge upou the product of &quot; the industry in which this course is taken.&quot;Each essential service would appoint a council representative of both the labour and capital involved ; from these councils a common council would bo elected, which, besides eo ordinating the services, would deter-mine tho respective shares of employers and workmen. Whatever the result, it is felt that such co-operation could not fail to dissipate prejudices and misundorstaudiuga.
10. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Capital, Labour, and the &quot;Open Shop.&quot;There is considerable discontent throughout the country and a section of native American workers are alleging that the war was instigated by the ruling classes and expressing their fear of capitalistic attack ou the working class itself. Hasty statements made recently by certain manufacturers have not been without a disturbing effect. Even the conservatively inclined press alleges against the Employers&apos; Association an attempt to lower wages and to break up Unions by deliberately throwing men out of work. Widespread revolutionary propaganda is also producing some disturbing effect.As against the Courts aud the Congress of the American Federation of Labour, organised Labour has adopted what it calls &quot;Labour&apos;s Bill of Rights.&quot; The demand of Labour, for which it asks public support, is not only the maintenance, but the improvement of the present standard0 as 871.8 rMatthew Giles, Divisional Organiser of the &quot; Workers&apos; Union,&quot; (hiring a recent visit, established three branches of his union in Malta 1. Dockyard employees.2. Military employees (civilians).3, Private employees.The moderate tone adopted by Mr. Giles was evidently merely adapted to his audience, aud did not express his real views ; the slight hint he gave of the latter caused such consternation that he at once altered bis tone. But it is somewhat significant that his particular friends were the three worst agitators in the island, two of whom were in diro financial straits before his arrival, and immediately after became well supplied with money, able to send their sons to the university and abroad, while the third was a thoroughly unscrupulous editor of the vernacular paper, &quot; II Hmar.&quot;After the departure of Giles a formidable campaign was launched by the Church to counteract the anti-Catholic and extreme principles con-tained in the statutes of the union. Tho Archbishop has accepted the honorary presidency ol Branch No. 1 on condition that passages advoea-ting class hatred and conflict with capital be deleted from the statutes and his orders implicitly obeyed. It is probable that the other two branches will follow the example of the first, and finally secede from the English Workers&apos; Union with which they are now affiliated.Italian irredentism has received a serious blow through the publica-tion in the &quot; Malta Herald &quot; of an article by Ferdinando Pasini, a well-known writer of the Trenlino, which has done more to destroy the pro-Italian Party than any other event for years. Italian irredentism has never received much support, although the Maltese desire the protection of the Italian language and of Italian culture in their island. PasinPs article has opened the eyes of the general public to the danger of repeated protests by certain elected members on the subject of &quot; La nostra lingua Italiana,&quot; which Italians may well misconstrue into an expression of Italian irredentist sentiment on the part of the Maltese population.
of wages and working conditions. It rejects the terms of injunctions seeking to prohibit the doing of acts &quot; which workers have a lawful and guaranteed right to do.&quot; The American Federation of Labour is also attacking the &quot;open shop &quot; movement, which it alleges is being used by employers to disrupt trades unionism. On the other hand, organised capital, convinced that a reduction of wages must come, asks the workers to realise that war conditions cannot continue once the cost of living is reduced.One of the things which Labour most strongly resents is the decision of the Supreme Court that, where they depart from their normal and legitimate objects aud engage in an actual combination or conspiracy iu restraint of trade, Labour unions become Trusts, and are therefore subject to the law regulating Trusts when they act in restraint of trade. This decision raises the question whether the agreement between tho great producers of structural steel (led by tho Bethlehem Steel Corporation) that they will sell nothing to concerns maintaining the &quot; closed shop&quot; does not involve the principle of tho secondary boycott.A hill is to be brought into Congress by the American Federation of Labour, declaring that Labour organisations arc not co-partnerships, and are not liable to be so treated either in law or equity.Strikes.There appears to bo a prospect of a general strike of both officers and men aboard American ships on May 1st, on account of the alleged refusal of the shipowners to enter into a general conference with the Deep Sea Union when the existing working agreements expire. The shipowners consider it necessary to cut down expenses, state objection to the existing wage scale and provision for overtime pay. Admiral Benson, chairman of the United States Shipping hoard, while frankly sympathising with the seamen, appreciates the necessity for a reduction of expenses,   lie has promised to do all he can to avert a general strike.There are grave fears that the incoming of the new Administration may synchronise with grave railway troubles. The men refuse to accept reductions in their wages, while the employers claim permission to abrogate the agreements with Labour made during the war emergency, as the lines are in effect bankrupt. Thirty-six railways failed to earn their operating expenses in January. The only alternative is to raise the tariff, a doubtful expedient which usually results in reducing the traffic.The Federation oi Labour.The non-radical policy of Goinpers and his assistants appears to be causing internal dissatisfaction in the American Federation of Labour, and a number of men who for the last 20 or 30 years have been members of this organisation are said to be leaving it and joining the revolutionary organisations. If they remain i-t is to cause internal trouble in the Federation. There is also said to have been an infiltration of members of the Communist Party of America into the Federation and other non-revolutionary labour parties with instructions to break them up, This plan would appear to be widespread.An appeal to organised labour throughout the world has been made by the American Federation of Labour on behalf of trade unionists in Soviet Russia. Tho indictment is grave. The Federation declares that after &quot; tricking Labour into supporting Soviets,&quot; Trotsky and Lenin began &quot; carrying out their throats of exterminating the leaders
of Labour and of the peasants.&quot; Labour unionists, it is claimed, are &quot; fundamentally against the so-called government set up by Lenin and his handful of associated dictators,&quot; and the ruthless persecution and slaughter of Labour unionists now taking place in &quot; barbarous Soviet Russia,&quot; and Labour all over the world is requested to let the Soviet savages know what it thinks of their &quot; bestial system.&quot;The Communist Party.The activities of the Communist Tarty are less visible than a year ago, but its underground work is said to be a good deal more effective. Members of the party are even to be found in Government departments. Talk is being heard of the formation of a Red Army. Some of the leaders are said to be officers of the Czar&apos;s and Kercnsky&apos;s armies  young men of between 25 and 30 years of age, remnants of the different military and other missions sent to the United Stales before and during the war, who, after being tested as members of the Communist Tarty, are sent to use their military knowledge for the revolutionary eauso. Colonel Roustam Bek, Avho has acted in this matter without the official sanction of Martens, is said to have been in close consultation with tho American leaders of the Red Army, if he was not tho leading spirit in organising it. A collection of firearms and explosives is apparently being made for the use of the Red Army,Socialist Labour Party.The Socialist Labour Party has agreed, with reservations, to the 21 conditions of the Third International, if it does not formally accept them. Tlie Third International will, however, reject its application for affiliation. The Communist Party and the United Communist Party, which broke away from the Socialist Party in 1919, are now re-united and affiliated to the Third International.Irish and other Anti-British Agitations.Except in certain newspapers there is very little evidence of active resentment against this country in America, and&apos;in spite of the boasts of the Irish Americans the amount of American money sent to Ireland is comparatively small. It is not likely that much more will be sent It seems probable that a firm attitude will be taken by the new Adiniuis-tration, who consider that British money can be more suitably used in repaying her debts than in domestic measures.The hopes of the Irish Americans have been somewhat dashed by Mr. Harding&apos;s pronouncement &quot;that the Irish question is a domestic &quot; question of Great Britain, and the Government of America can have &quot; nothing to do with it.&quot;Four priests of the Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church are reported to travel between the United States and Canada for purposes inimical to those countries, one of the most dangerous of these being the Right Rev. Abbot Mython, known to Orthodox Greek Catholics as the Right Rev. Archimandrite Patrick, who acts as executive secretary of the &quot; Protestant Friends of Ireland.&quot; It is reported that secret societies are being planted throughout the United States and Canada. These men are under the protection of the present &quot;Archbishop&quot; of North America, Alexander Neinolosky, Bishop of Canada.A commission of five, to be known as the &quot;American Commission on Indian Independence,&quot; was appointed at the first annual meeting of thel? 2
&quot;Friends of Freedom for India&quot; to proceed to India to investigate outrages and persecution. Several public men and senators are said to have declared their sympathy with &quot;the liberation of India from British domination, and for the establishing of an Indian Republic.&quot; S. N. Ghose reported the receipt of 1,000,000 roubles from the Soviet Government.A new Japanese society has been started by a Japanese physician to aid Ireland and promote anti-British propaganda, and the Japanese local paper has appealed to all Japs to help the Irish in their fight for freedom.At the national conference of German Americans held in Chicago on January 9th the organisation took the name of the &quot; German American Citizens&apos; League of the United States,&quot; and divided the country into live districts. The leaders expect to have a membership within a year of over 2,000,000. Every member must be, or become, a citizen of the United States and a voter. A large fund is to be raised for propaganda against Britain.The society known as &quot; The Friends of Irish Freedom &quot; is reported to be disbanding and joining the new organisation for the &quot; Recognition of the Irish Republic.&quot; One of the members of tho latter society declares that the Irish labourers in the West Indian Islands are banding together to drive out not only tho English workers but the English black subjects as well.Tho Knights of Columbus, numbering about 1,200, have been organised as a volunteer army for an &quot;armed vendetta.&quot; They are secretly drilling in Philadelphia. This movement was planned some time ago, but difficulty arose through some of the knights being German Catholics. These, however, have now been won over, and are ready to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Irish.Trade with Russia.No restrictions are at present placed on trade and communication with Russia beyond the prohibition of the export to Russia of materials susceptible of immediate use for war purposes, such as locomotives, railway material, rolling stock, motor cars, and their component parts. For such articles a special permit is required. The importance to the States of Russian trade is fully recognised, and the idea of upbuilding the industries of Russia has gripped the imagination of the Americans not only from the utilitarian but also from the humanitarian point of view.The Departure and Legacy of Mr. Martens.A Committee of Four, under the leadership of Dr. Ilartman, the editor of &quot; Soviet Russia,&quot; has taken over the work of Ludwig Martens, late representative of the Soviet Government in New York. One of the members of this Committee recently arrived in the States, bringing over a large amount of money, part of which was given to the Communist Party and part sent to Mexico. He is a representative of the Third International. More than 40 agitators have been sent to North and South America by the Third International for revolutionary work.On his journey from America, Martens, with his whole party, at first refused to go on board the ship provided for him at Gothenburg by the Swedish Government, on the ground that it was run by &quot;blackleg&quot; engineers.
In tho end expediency conquered principle and the party left Sweden, with the exception of 42 third class passengers who refused to board the &quot; Sodra Suerige.&quot; Martens was voluble with reasons for refusing to go on board, hut it is probable that his desire to interview Professor Lomonosoff&apos;was the correct one. He is optimistic about the resumption of trade between America and Soviet Russia, and predicts that a new delegation will proceed to New York within the next few months. He appears to anticipate considerable less difficulty when tho now President comes into office.The deportation order against Martens was cancelled after his depar-ture by the Department of Labour. Martens is, until he applies for an American visa, free to return tit any time to the United States.Washington Baker Vanderlip redivivus.On his arrival in Moscow Martens reported that Mr. Washington Raker Vanderlip was again leaving America for Moscow. According to a wireless press message from Moscow the success of this adventurers visit depends on the receipt of serious guarantees from the American Government regarding the exchange of goods, inviolability of Russian goods and gold in America, and the removal of the possibility of the recurrence of such incidents tis the expulsion of the Russian Diplomatic Mission from the States. The Soviet Government assures the world that when Senator Harding conies into power Mr. Wilson&apos;s policy towards Soviet Russia will be reversed.Vanderlip, who stayed in Stockholm under tho name of W. B. Vincent, gave out that the purpose of his visit to Moscow was the opening of Consular postal and telegraph offices, and that he figured that commercial relations between Soviet Russia and the United States of America would be in working order by the middle of May.At Reval he had an unsatisfactory interview with Litvinoff, and left for Moscow on February 27th. From Moscow his voice was heard by wireless predicting that trade between America and Russia, interrupted by the departure of Martens, would be resumed within the next few days, that 20 per cent, of American Mercantile Marine at present lying idle would transport goods to Russia via Riga and Reval immediately, and direct to Petrograd in the spring; that 2,000 locomotives are to be built and delivered to Soviet Russia within a year, and 5,000 during the next three years.11. CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES. MEXICO.Twenty-five agitators, former residents in the United States and speaking English fluently, are at the present time in Mexico awaiting orders to cross the border into the United States. These men have been sent out by the Third International for revolutionary work in North and South America.The house of Mgr. Mora, Archbishop of Mexico, who recently preached against the spread of Bolshevism, and the premises of an American jeweller have been wrecked by bombs. The &quot;Reds&quot; are believed to be responsible in both cases. Fortunately there were no casualties.
12. SOUTH AMERICAN STATES. ARGENTINE.The Socialist Party has decided to refuse adherence to the Third International, partly, it is said, because the Soviet Government has omitted to seek their support, and. has shown thorn no special eonsidora-tion.The slump in the woollen industry, with the consequent refusal on the part of the fanners to increase wages, is believed to be lospousiblo for tho outbreak of boycotting and intimidation which has now developed into actual guerilla warfare in Santa Cruz. Estates have been raided, arms, horses, money, and motor cars carried off, and a police commissary and several prominent landowners taken anil held to ransom. Appeals for protection for British subjects and property have been made to the authorities, and a detachment of sailors, with reinforcements of cavalry and infantry, havo been sent to keep order and to afford protection to the Anglo-South American Bank, which was in special danger.An application for police protection made by the West India Oil Company at Gampana was refused by order of the President, who approved the chauffeurs&apos; claim to buy petrol at a lower rate than that paid by the public, which is enormously high ou account of the shortage caused by the strike.The shipping strike, which has lasted for over a year, is reported by telegram to have been practically settled. The supiueness of the Government in regard to it led to a very serious state of affairs, especially in the southern Provinces, which were completely cut off, owing to the boycott declared by the Federaoion Obrera Regional Argentina. The inhabitants lied for refuge to Chile from the anarchists and bandits, who murdered landowners and their families, seizing farm produce and burning properties. Though the Argentine authorities sent troops to the dis-affectod regions they were neither adequate nor efficient.The Mihauovitch strike shows no sign of settlement although several ineffectual meetings have taken place between the directors and the Federacion Obrcra Maritima. As further evidence of the Governments apparent support of the F.O.M. it is reported that when free labour was supplied by one of the masters&apos; societies to discharge coal for a company boycotted by the F.O.M. a custom house officer handed the foreman in charge of the work au official order to cease work.After a long period of tranquillity and cordial co-operation between masters and men discord is threatened on the railways. The points at issue are universal gradation of wages on all railways and tho recogui-tion of &quot;La Confraternidad Ferroviaria,&quot; which claims to conduct negotiations on behalf of the unassociated groups of traffic and workshop employees, and also of the &quot; Fraternidad &quot; of drivers. The companies are willing to accept the principle of gradation, but not of uniformity over all railways, because of the different conditions ruling on each system. The men have accepted the proposal that each company should treat separately with its workmen, but demand that the negotiations shall take place simultaneously and within a specified period, which is said to be a practical impossibility. The &quot; Confraternidad &quot; is frankly subversive and adheres to the &quot; Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina,&quot; which advocates direct revolutionary action, overthrow of capitalists and state, general strikes and boycotts. It is feared that a &quot; ca&apos; canny &quot; principle may be adopted which would make the regular operation of the railways almost impossible.
URUGUAY AND PARAGUAY.It is interesting to note how differently the situation created by the Mihanovitoh strike is handled by the Governments of Uruguay and Paraguay. In the Port of Montevideo, which is run by Uruguay, the Government refuses to be dictated to by the federated men and free and federated labour work jointly under equal conditions ; while the Paraguayan Government actually upholds the Mibanovitcb Steamer Service, supplies free labour and entirely ignores the Maritime Union, a naval commander beinij detailed for each steamer as a protective measure. Two of Uruguay^ Mihanovitch Company&apos;s steamers are captained by ex-Uruguayan naval otlicors.CHILE.At a meeting of the Third Congress of the Socialist Workinen&apos;s Party of Chile it was decided to change the name to that of tho &quot;Communist Party&quot; and to adopt the 21 conditions of the Third International.Socialist agitators are endeavouring to obtain the socialisation of the saltpetre industry. Troops aud warships have been sent to Santiago by the Government to maintain order.
PART II.1. THE LEGHORN CONFERENCEResume of Directions of the Executive of the Moscow nternatwnal to Communist Delegates?This resume was delivered by Chris to Kaisakschiew, the Delegate of the, Executive of the Third Into national at the Leghorn Con-ference to Pastor IIumberl-Droz, the Delegate at the same. Conference of the Swiss Communist Party.1, In each country where a Communist Party is founded revo-lntionary agitation will proceed according to the programme laid down by the Committee of the Third International and in pursuance of the principle of the arming of the proletariat and the use of violence directed to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.2. To this end, and to co-ordinate the action of the different Communist Parties, each of these shall delegate one of its representatives to the Executive Committee of the Third International in Moscow.3. Pursuant upon the Congresses of the French, Italian, and German Socialist Parties, the Communist Parties shall const it at j themselves in these different countries and shall without delay set up in tho different centres secret and illegal organisations to be placed under the authority of the Executive Committee in Moscow.4. Each Communist Party shall elect an Executive Committee, a member of which, chosen with the greatest possible discretion, shall be charged with the carrying into effect of the illegal organisations upon the lines of a programme of terrorist action to be communicated later.2. THE MORROW OF LEGHORN.The International Revolutionary Situation as viewed by the Executive of the Third International,The Executive Committee of the Third International is reliably reported to view the international situation as follows : (1) There exist powerful Nationalist movements of a revolutionary character, and hence supported by the Government of Moscow, in the British Colonies in Asia, and in Italian and French Mussulman possessions in Northern Africa. These Nationalist movements are developing and will soon break the power of England.(2) There exist Communist revolutionary movements in France, England, Germany, Central Europe, and Scandinavia. The economic crisis now in process of development will be their most powerful auxiliary for the liberation of the proletariats.(3) In the Balkans, secret organisations are ready to create by force the federation of Balkan Soviets as soon as the Red armies are* Note. Details of this and of the following article are, for the most part, con-firmed by other reports from reliable informants,
able to make themselves felt upon the frontiers of roumania, in Poland, and in Northern Germany.(4) At tho present moment a provisional plan of military action against the Anglo-Franco-Belgian capitalist coalition is being considered simultaneously by the High Command of the Red Army, German Communist Delegates, and German (aud Russian ?) intransigent monarchists. This plan, however, can only come into force when Germany has become a Com-munist Republic.(5) Before commencing the great decisive action for the liberation of peoples on the orders of the Executive Committee of tho Third International, criminal attempts will be made by the illegal organisations in the different countries against the personalities whose opposition to the general revolutionary movement is most effective. The sole judge, however, of the moment when it is opportune to launch this programme shall be the Moscow Committee, which will only he iu a position to give the word when it has obtained tangible results iu the British Asiatic Colonies as a result of the development of Nationalist revolu-tionary movements there. These movements will, /here/ore, be the sign that the Communist revolution is at hand.(6) Contrary to previous announcements, Moscow now expects military action ou the part of the Red armies to develop only about June or July next. Till then the Communist Parties are authorised (?)* to continue the struggle by means appropriate to the internal situation of their different countries on condition that before taking steps they shall first, for each particular line of action, receive the authority of Moscow.3. COMMUNIST INFLUENCES AND PARTIES IN GERMANY.In a report delivered at the Saehsa Conference of the Western European Secretariat, Dr. Lange, head of the Communist Propaganda and Intelligence Department in Germany, differed considerably from his predecessor, James Reich, as regards the real success of Communism in that country. Reich, he said, had been misled by the fact that the Spartacists, who in March 1920 had scarcely numbered 35 to 36,000 strong, at Ins resignation numbered 140,000. Mathematical data, Dr. Lange said, produced results which, though theoretically correct, were Utopian in practice. The changes in the minds of the German prole-tariat were due to external causes rather than intimate persuasion. While &quot;news from the West&quot; steadily encouraged the growth of a conviction of the necessity of revolution in the minds of the German proletariat, &quot; news from the East &quot; brought disillusionment, distrust, and anxiety with regard to the achievements of a dictatorship of the proletariat, introduced into Germany by methods recommended by Moscow.Ou the one hand the pressure of the Versailles Treaty, the unprcce-dented high indirect taxation to which the German Ministry for Finance found itself compelled to resort, the growth of unemployment, the deinobi-lisation of the army, all tended to arouse the revolutionary spirit in the German proletariat, which, though tinged with a strong admixture of narrow patriotism, was most auspicious to propaganda and to the increase of the ranks of the Third International.* Text defective.
On the other hand the process of disillusionment originated with the arrival of the first steamer carrying German workmen returning from Soviet Russia, and ripened and developed with each successive batch of arrivals. German workmen were confused at the contradictions they observed in Russia when comparing the theory and practice of the Moscow Government. They were astounded to see how strongly the tales of their friends returning from Soviet, Russia tallied with the tales which are being published in the yellow pages of &quot;our small bourgeois press.&quot;Dr. Lunge considers that until the Congress in Halle tho influence of the extreme Loft was strong. Its power was concentrated in the toiling masses, who, while styling themselves &quot;Independents,&quot; unqucstioningly obeyed its orders. The working masses then formed one compact body, Tho ideas of the Second and Third Internationals existed side by side, differences of opinion being overruled by the consciousness of the masses and by intelligent comprehension of class interests. The leaders of the Third International in Germany were slowly but surely conquering one position after another. To the frequent accusations of delay, conciliation, and opportunism by the Central Committee of the Third International in Moscow the German leaders replied that an alteration of their party policy would be premature, that neither the spirit nor the education of the German was such that he would blindly follow instructions which did not conform to his conception of class warfare, and that, should they follow the advice of Moscow, they would destroy the front of proletarian conflict in Central Europe, while weakening their influence among the masses of the middle workmen in order to at tract only an insignificant number of leaders of the small labour unions, who, in any case, were always on their side.Their arguments were vain. The Congress of Halle took place. Officially the Third International conquered, but its leaders in Germany felt that the game had not been worth the candle.Comparing the present conditions with those previous to the Halle Congress, it is true that the extreme Left has conquered in a geographical sense. In all industrial districts in Germany it has its party nuclei and these are two or three times as strong as they were before October. Dr. Lange is, however, positive that it has obtained nothing to its advantage, that interference by Moscow has advertised its cause while rendering the advertisement worthless. It would indeed have been difficult to find a more unfavourable moment for the disclosure in Germany of party aims and methods than that chosen by Moscow. Dr. Lange fears that tho middle workmen, the foundation of the whole labour movement, will be as discouraged as he, and will lack sufficient energy for the continuation of party work as it should be conducted. Party pride has conquered, but nearly at the expense of the defeat of the Labour movement.Dr. Lange&apos;s strong plea for regional freedom in the conduct of the revolutionary movement in Germany includes criticism of the incompetent methods of supplying funds from Moscow to Kopp&apos;s Soviet mission. He complains that bureaucratism and unnecessary economy frequently hinder party work and delay necessary measures. The Western European Secretariat, he contends, should be entirely independent of Moscow &quot;diplomats&quot; and subordinate only to the Central Committee of the Third International, through the department for Western European Propaganda. He concludes by trusting that at the moment of triumph the German proletariat will not make the fatal mistake made by the Russian proletariat, but preserving the strength which it has in its secret adherents among the labouring intellectuals will advance to Socialism without bloodshed,
Meanwhile the Executive Committee of the Moscow International has passed a resolution, registering the German Communist Labour Party as a sympathising member of the Third International, which brings up the whole question of the present relations of Moscow with the German Unified Communist Party under Paul Levi. Participation of the Communist Party in parliamentary elections and their attempts to plant germ cells iu the trades unions are opposed to the tactics of the Communist Labour Party, who desire to destroy the unions and replace them by Soviets. Tho strongest point of difference, however, appears to be tho clauseiu the 21 points insisting on one single Communist Party in each country. Moscow, until its recent recognition of the Communist Labour Party, acted ou this point and recognised the Communist Party as the sole repository of authority. It had apparently hoped to find in the Unified Communist Party a congenial political ally. The influx of the Left Independents, however, strengthened the influence of the Opportunists inside the Communist Party so as to place them far to the Right of what are known as the Opportunist elements in the Soviet government, which consequently transferred its blessing to the Communist Labour Party.Moscow was particularly dissatisfied with the Opportunist policy of Paul Levi, who is now frequently called a &quot; Salon-Sozialist,&quot; mid who along with Daeumig protested vehemently against the duplicity of &quot; the opposite of cleverness &quot; of Muscovite policy, exemplified in tho transfer of the affections of the Executive Committee of the Third International to the Communist Labour Party. The resignation at the end of February of Levi, Daeumig, and Clara Zetkin from the Executive of the German Communist Party shows to what lengths the difference has gone, and the depth of disillusionment with Moscow into which the leaders of the Communist Parly have been driven. A few months only have passed since Lenin himself sharply included the ideas and conduct of tho now favoured Communist Labour Party among the &quot;infantile diseases&quot; of Communism.In conclusion, it would appear that Moscow feels that the Communist Party is slipping out of its grasp, and already if is reported that there are Communist Labour Party cells at work in the interests of Moscow within the Gorman Communist Party.4. RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES IN TRANS-CASPIA.As reported by Eliava* Commissar in Trans-Caucasia, Asia Minor,and Turkestan, to the Conference of the Western European Secretariat of the Third International, held in the TIarz Mountainsin December 1920.Iu August 1919 I and several other Comrades received orders to start work in Turkestan and Fergan, which two regions had just been conquered by us from the White Guards bauds in the north and the English mercenaries in the south. On our arrival we were disconcerted by rinding that these fertile regions were utterly devastated by permanent warfare. We found the inhabitants enemies, not only to Communism, but to everything Russian. We came to understand the &quot; Basmats-chestwo,&quot; a pure Mussulman movement, which has spread all over the oasis of Fergan.   Our arrival practically synchronised with the general* .Eliava is the Bolshevik representative of Mustapha Kcmafs government.
rising of the Mussulmans, who had been reduced to a state of absolute misery by the futility of tho leaders of the Soviet Republic, under circumstances, it is true, which to a certain extent excused their failure, since for two years this region had been cut off&apos; from Moscow and ruled only by local workmen, who applied the Soviet system too rigidly, without reference to local conditions. Those workmen were also under the thumb of the priests and steeped in the dogmatism of Shariat and Agat. Their excessive zeal resulted in whole tribes (Kirgiz) passing into China and whole Turkish tribes passing into Persia,No liaison had thus been established with any centre in neighbouring countries ; oven at Bokhara and Shiva no agencies of the Soviet goveru-mcnt existed, although the pro-revolutionary Russian Consulates were still functioning.   Everything had to be started afresh.To create the atmosphere we had recourse to a policy of compromise and bido our time to start nuclei, which once they were started soon supplied the Soviet government with a bund of convinced and efficient Communists amongst the Sarsh, Turkish and Fikin population.Our greatest difficulties, of course, were food and transport. Naphtha, wood, and coal were lacking ; tlse water conduits were dilapidated, the workmen scattered, Frequent attacks of Ourgan Bey, Madagin Beck, and other Bachmatch who ruled in the thinly populated and distant steppes complicated our task. By tho combined efforts of Bed troops and the support of certain leading Kirgiz tribes we succeeded in putting an end to the Baclunatch. Food for tho starving population was obtained from the steppe district.Parallel to this, propaganda work was increasing. Of course neither Moscow nor we (the Turko Mission) believed that the Mussulmans in Turkestan were sufficiently propagandised to accept socialistic ideas, but we well know that, by a purely superficial association with Bolshevism, the Mussulman would serve as a bridge to the Far East, and in tins way create political complications for the Entente and primarily for England. Our network of agitation had developed and penetrated far into Afghan-istair, and thence into Northern India. At our first district meeting at Samarkand, in February 1920, delegates attended not only from the Pamir, Afghanistan, &amp;c, but from tho heart of India Madras, Delhi, Madasore (? Balasore), Calcutta, Bombay, and even Ceylon. It was there that I saw for the first time what a strong common bond hatred of tho oppressors is, how animosities between tribes and religious which had lasted for centuries are forgotten in the cause of liberty, and how caste animosities are also forgotten. About 1,500 delegates were welded together into one body, as it seemed ; they thought in the same way, and became enthusiastic over the same idea, viz., to he free as a nation and to rid themselves of the political and social bondage in which they were kept, in Turkestan, by Czarist Russia ; in India, by insatiate bourgeois England.Remember, nobody had agitated in India and there was no notification of the meeting. Only on rumour and without our summons, thousands of oppressed people sent us their representatives who had to pass through a double cordon of English guards, through impossible mountains, often walking to the new Mecca of the Mussulmans -Turkestan, Samarkand.From the tactical point of view, this assembly at Samarkand gave very great results. We established alive liaison with the whole of India and Southern Persia and through this the possibility of establishing direct contact with Turkey, Arabia, and Egypt.The National Assembly of Angora sent to the Reunion Guri Pasha, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government Achmed
Mukhtar (the latter&apos;s declaration us to the programme of the Xatiooal Assembly at Angora was the decisive factor in uniting the Mussulman portion of the Assembly, and served as a basis for the foundation at the conference of the &quot; Union for the Liberation of tho East &quot; au organ isa-tion which controls Turkestan at the present moment and through which Moscow directs the complex work of political propaganda in Central Asia and Asia Minor).The emissaries of the &quot;Union&quot; despatched by the Assembly, to all centres in Turkestan and Mongolia, to Mohammedan China, to the Himalayas, to the Punjab, and to the Indus (?) with the appeal of tin; &quot;Liberation of the East,&quot; received everywhere the full sympathies of the population and the support of the indigenous organisations. Their duty was to unite tho numerous local parties, brotherhoods, and organisations into one brotherhood the Third International under the Hag of a Holy War of the Oppressed against the Oppressors. The result of their work was instantaneous.The first stronghold of Mussulman absolutism and barbarism was Shiva. In March, theMvhan had to flee to Kabul, aud at Shiva tho first Soviet was established which became an ally of Soviet Russia.From Shiva the Communist movement, under the flag of Pan-Islamisin, passed to Afghanistan. The attempts of the Amir to prevent its spreading were fruitless, and the re-opening of friendly relations with England on the grounds of a common struggle was only to our advantage. Our strength lay in the Mussulman priests who, with unlimited authority over the masses, are fanatically influenced by*the idea of the &quot; Liberation of the East.&quot; In summer, however, the official representative mission of the Turkestan Federation could not officially travel across the Afghanistan frontier and, in the autumn, a Soviet wireless station was already established in Kabul. Tbe Amir receives surreptitiously the Soviet representative and gives permission to the Tadgiks to cross the Afghanistan frontier. The Tadgiks, in the meautime, are introducing Communism into Turkestan ami their homes will become strongholds of our propaganda.These external diplomatic victories were the consequences of political victories on the inner Turkestan front.The &quot;Union of the Liberation of the East&quot; has given birth to another organisation the &quot;Young Socialist of the East,&quot; whose object is a Holy War, and which has already secured for the ranks of the Red Army, the fighting tribes Kara-Kirgiz, Tadgiks, Tekinsky, Turmen, and, of course, Sarts. Formed into volunteer units, they supplied the best cavalry in tbe world (60,000) and definitely liquidated Bachmatch. Transportation has been re-organised and naphtha production in Krasnovodsk ; the water conduits were repaired and trains circulated without escort. The administrative centre has once more moved to Tashkent.   Samarkand is the centre of the party work.5. COMMUNIST DIFFERENCES REGARDING RUSSIAN TRADE UNIONS.Parallel with differences regarding Avar aud peace, regarding the granting of concessions to foreigners, and regarding university admim-stration, divergencies of opinion have arisen between the &quot; absolutists &quot; and &quot;opportunists &quot; in the Soviet Government regarding the functions and structure of the trade unions.
Pending the final decision at the meeting of the Communist Party in March, the Executive of the Party have adopted the &quot;opportunist&quot; view of Lenin by 62 votes to 8.As to the existence and urgency of the problem the parties are at one. In the beginning of the Russian revolution the unions faced the problem of the struggle against the then Government for the material and spiritual advancement of the working classes. As the revolution developed the new problem of participating in the reconstruction of the economic life of the country arose.In effect, all parties of the Soviet Government, while enthusiastic about the independence of the unions, so long as they were confronting Czardom, are less enthusiastic about their independence vis-a-vis of the Soviet Government.The transition from the old problems to the new, and incidentally the transition from Czardom to the Soviet regime, has had tho effect of weakoning the trade union organisations. The Soviet authorities recognise, however, that the reconstruction of economic life in Russia can only be accomplished by the direct participation of tho working masses in production, and that the trade unions are the obvious instru-ments for this consolidation of the working masses in Russia.The Russian Communist Party, therefore, recognises that it has (1) to invigorate tho trades unions, and (2) to draw them to direct participation in production.As regards practical applicatio.ii, there are three policies : (1) The policy of Trotsky : to nationalise the unions, fusing them with the economic organs and transferring to them all functions of production.(2) The policy of Lenin and Zinovicv : the indefinite postpone-meiit of nationalisation of the trades unions, their preservation meanwhile as organs distinct from the Government, and their use as schools of Communism until they have united and thoroughly assimilated the &quot; non-Party&quot; Russian proletariat.(3) The intermediate policy of Buchariu, who holds that, while, temporarily, the trades unions must formally remain non-party and independent of the Soviet Government, and that such formal independence is the expression of the careful, tactful approach of the non-party masses, the progressive tendency of this policy should be the growth of the actual dependence and partisanship of the trade unions.Thesis I.  Trotsky.Owing to the superhuman exertion of all forces of the working class to meet the demands of the war, tho methods of workers&apos; democracy (wide discussion, criticism, &amp;c.) had to be strongly limited. The pro-problems which the trades unions have to face at present do not conform with the habits of thought and methods of work still reigning within them as a vestige of the past. Professional conservatism among the leading elements of the trade union workers has diverted the trades unions from the responsible constructive work on which they should be engaged.The trade union as it is does not conform with the trade union as it should be.   In the Avorkers&apos; State the trades unions can wage no
economic class struggle. There is no room for separately organised specialists in the field of organisation of production and in the field of the trade union movement. Everybody who is for the socialist production is also needed for the trade union and vice versa. Trade unions should gradually be turned into organs of the workeis&apos; State, and the organs of the uuions should be gradually fused with the economic organs. It is not a matter of declaring the trades unions officially to be organs of the State ; they must be turned actually into productive organisations, embracing every branch of industry and responsible for the interests of the production and of the producers. Every new stage in our econmy must at the same time imply a new stage in the direction of fusing the trade union organs with the economic organs.In a workers&apos; State the problem of organisation of labour can have only production for its basis and aim. The organisation of labour and the organisation of production must coincide. Organs of the trade unions must be gradually fused with the economic organs. The trade union worker should look upon himself not as au advocate in matters of satisfying the demands of the workers, but as an organiser of the toilers for production on the basis of constantly improving technique,In the workers&apos; State there is sense in the trade union only as it actually masters production, improving the organisation of labour, increasing its productivity, and so improving the material conditions of the masses and raising them to a higher intellectual level.Thesis ii. Lenin,&apos; Zinoviev, Ka/neneff&apos;, and others.The most important part assigned to the unions in Soviet Russia is that of being schools of Communism, the elementary school for political education and Organisational habits for the widest and even the most backward masses of workers. This role can be fulfilled only inasmuch as they are leaders of the proletarian masses in communist activities. They are non-party mass organisations, embracing workers of various political views and moods, party members and non-party men, literate and illiterate, religious and irreligious.All these must first of all be drawn in and won over for Soviet con-struction. The methods to be employed must be those of conviction and not of coercion. This does not exclude, however, the application of proletarian coercion by the unions in cases of emergency, such as com-pulsory mobilisation, &amp;c.While the policy of the unions in matters of principle should be, as heretofore, directed by the Communist party through its central and local organisation, the party organisations and individual party members must be imperatively warned against a petty guardianship and excessive meddling with the daily work of the labour unions.The economic departments of the unions must, however, now prepare their organisation in accordance with the plans worked out by the Soviet authorities. Labour unions must participate in the working out of the unified economic plans and in fulfilling the industrial programme adopted by the Government.Thesis III. Bucharin, Preobrazhensky, and others.The unions are, on the one hand, schools of Communism, the inter? intermediary agent betAveen the party and non-party masses, an apparatus for drawing the wide proletarian masses into active life. On the other hand, in a constantly increasing degree, they are a fundamental part of the economic apparatus of the Government in general. This inevitable duality is constant and. cannot be dissolved.
Trade unions will more and more carry out State functions ; but must temporarily remain formally non-party and independent in relation to the Soviet Government, such non-partisanship and formal independence being the expression of the careful, tactful approach to the non-party masses, whom we gradually teach without boasting of our role of teachers.Jf the general course of development is the nationalising of the unions, so on the other hand, this process is also a process of unionising the Government. The logical and historical limit of this process will be that both categories, unions and State, will vanish and will he replaced by a third category, a society re-organised on the basis of Communism.printed by eyre and spottiswoode, ltd., east harding street, e.0.4.
