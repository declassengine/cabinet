There is evidenoe that the Communist Party has been strongly affected by the reoont prosecutions.   It has warned its agitators against intemperate language.The most important questions of the moment are unemployment and reductions in wages.    To-day the sub-Committee of the Triple Alliance will discuss the proposal of the Building Trades &apos;0peratives that there should be a combined Labour policy to resist reductions. Meanwhile, the vehicle builders and about 2,000 Glasgow electricians are on strike.   The general trend of working class opinion is the acceptance of a reduction and violent opposition would be unlikely if there were a possibility of more employment and lowered prioea.Unemployment is most serious in Lancashire and Cheshire snd feeling is reported to be running very high in Manchester.There is evidence that the Red International of Trade Unions has expended more than  1,000, which could not have been contributed from British sources.A national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation will be held to-morrow.*The National Union of Railwayman has declared itself in favour of State ownership of the railways.The Communist Party is starting a &quot;Release the Prisoners&quot; campaign next Sunday.A report of the after effects of the Prince of wales visit to Glasgow is included.Outbreaks/
Outbreaks of Sinn Fein arson continue in lingland.   The Sinn Feiners are planning some striking form of outrage for to-day (St. Patrick1b Day).Considerable feeling.was aroused by the executions that took place in Dublin on Mcnday,   For the moment the talk of a truce whioh was rife a week ago has diod.dovm.
THE C0Mf.-!UNIST3The absence of disorder and even of violent speechesduring the past week is a testimony to the value of acentralised policy in the prosecution for incitement tosedition.    The Communist P&amp;rty is greatly perturbed by the arrest of its agitators and has sent to all branches a circular giving instructions for a &quot;Release the PrisonersCampaign&quot;, which is to be opened with a mass meeting inTrafalgar Square next Sunday.    The circular, which is signed by Tom Bell, the organising secretary, concludes with thefollowing significant paragraph:&quot;finally, having regard to the immature state of party organisation, your Executive urges that all comrades shall exercise, at this stage, general discretion and levelheadedness in connection with their propaganda, so as to make the repressive task of the authorities against us as difficult as possible.&quot;If we may judge from the comparative mildness of the speeches during the past week these instructions have beenobeyed.Ho one could have foreseen that, at a time when there is widespread and genuine hardship from unemployment and when the agitators have been supplied with funds from abroad, there should have been so little growth of revolutionary feeling.    It is a very high testimony to the good sense and moderation of the English working man.It is stated on the handbills announcing the Trafalgar Square meeting, that the use of the Albert Hall, the Central Hall and the Eingsway Hall for the demonstration has been refused.In connection with Oallacher&apos;8 arrest, which John Maclean acknowledges to have been &quot;good tactics&quot;, from the Government point of view, it is of interest to note that the Communist Party has taken over responsibility for the maintenance of his dependents, and incidentally, a sum of  38. 6. 6d. which ha3 been collected by   &quot;the worker&quot;/
Worker&quot; for them.Pat Quinlaa. an American communist. v;ho attended the Second Congress of the Third International, has recently been expelled from Denmark.   He has apparently been acting as an agent or courier for the Communist Party of Great Britain, v/hich in February sent him ZZO for his expenses.Lack of funds appears to be impeding the Coventry bra^ of the Communist Party: most of the members are un employe j and resent the constant appeals for money.   They have nowAbeen called upon by headquarters to contribute 50$ to the defence fund for Emery and are expected to support the1woman with whom he has boon living.   It is a somewhat curious fact that the members object to doing this, in spite of Emery1 a personal popularity, because his deserted wife and a young child arc living in penury in another townIt is probable that the Communist Party of Great Britain, in selecting William Gallacher as a communist candidate for East Leicester, expect that ho will bo released from prison, as was John MacLean at the General Election, to contest the seat.   The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; somewhat naively remarks that &quot;In the event of C-allacher not being released from prison to conduct the campaign in person, it has been arranged that Arthur MacKanus, chairman of the party, shall act as &quot;proxy candidate&apos;.&quot; There is no doubt that Gallacher&apos;s imprisonment is the most serious blow which the revolutionary movement in        1 Great Britain has suffered for some time.   A Leicester branch of the Communist Party was formed on March 8th, but its membership is at present insignificant and in spite of the offer of a reasonable weekly salary, made by James Stewart, the Midland organiser, a leader has not yet been found.   The branch, together with the Left Wingof/
of the Independent Labour Party, will give Mrs. Snowden or mr. Ramsay Macdonald an exceedingly hostile reception, if either of them stand as Labour candidate.One of my correspondents who has been in close touchwith W. Paul sends the following report of an interviewbetween Lenin and Paul:&quot;Paul was requested to form a strong Communist Party in Great Britain, and Lenin promised all the support he could possibly give, both financial and material.   Lenin told Paul that there were two men in Britain he was afraid  of;   Mr. Lloyd George, who would sign an agreement with a fountain pen in one . hand and a dagger in the other, and Mr. Vinston Churchill, who believed in blood and iron, but who lot everybody know  what he was going to do.   One of the signatories to the 25 American Bankers1 letters to Lenin was Warren Harding, now President of the United States.   Lenin stated he (Mr. Harding) would soon be his servant, because the only country both are afraid of is Japan.&quot;If the capitalist armies had concentrated on one place, instead of breaking themselves up, they would undoubtedly have overthrown the Soviet Government, said Lenin, but now none of them could do that except Japan.   Lenin is working to embroil Japan and America in war, and Britain would have to join Japan owing to the &quot;secret agreement which has never been published.&quot; This would be the time for all the revolutionary parties to throw aside their petty squabbles, and stride for the dictatorship of the proletariat.   Until that time comes agitation must be carried on in the workshop, trade unions and even in the church, and if the workers will not aocept communism through their heads, then they must bo foroed to accept it through their stomachs.&quot;THE RED INTERNATIONAL OP TRADE UNIONSAn important secret document discloses the amountdisbursed by the corresponding&apos; seoretary of this movement from the time of tons Inauguration until the beginning ofMaroh:   the main items are:&quot;Expenditure re the Bureau&quot; .  427.   10.    7i&quot;Expenditure re B.A.C. Bureau&quot;        688.    8.   llft   1115.   19.    7Against these items is set, &quot;Total income from all sources&quot;  1140.0.0-1-.   It seems, however, perfectly clear, since the first appeals for British money have been issued thisweek/
week, that &quot;all sources&quot; are Russian sources.Reports indicate that tho Red International movement wil shortly reach the stage when it will clash with orthodox trade unionism.    Action has hitherto been confined largely to branches, vigilance committees, and shop stewards, but aa the resolutions reach the national headquarters of the vario unions, the officials will be obliged to take some action. Tho next few weeks should therefore determine the future of the movement.   Meanwhile, the activity of the organisers is unabatecl and reliable evidence suggests that they are behind the unrest in the National Seamen&apos;s and FiremenTs Union, from the presidency of which they hope to depose Mr. Havelock Wilson.Prom March 31st to April 3rd a conference will be heldat Sheffield at which an attempt will be made to unify allthe unofficial organisations and link them up with theRed International of Trade Unions:   Workers1 Committees,Shop Stewards, Reform Committees, Vigilance Committees andprobably the Industrial Workers of the World and theWorkers&apos; International Industrial Union v/ill be represented,A national council is to be elected on the basis of two      \representatives each of North England, South England,Scotland and Wales.   She conference,which is the outcome of the recent secret meeting at Manchester (vide my R/R.92)will consider reports from various sections of the movement,draft a constitution and rules, and debate &quot;draft theses&quot;on:1.   The World Revolution and the immediate tasks before the Industrial organisations &apos;of the British Workers.2. The Unions and dictatorship.3, State Ownership and Control of Industry.4, Unemployment. - ; -5. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.- , UIMRI.OYIOTT/
- 5 - m-    156miSMPLOYMMTThere is little change in London hut in Manchester the cumulative effect of unemployment is becoming graver. The long queues waiting for relief cause much discussion and the steadier men are turning more or less spontaneously to tho contemplation of direct action.   It is significant that at a Manchester meeting organised by the Gorton and Openshaw Unemployed Committee all the speakers were Communists.   Between 2,000 and 3,000 people were addressed by Xooly, Robinson, Jenkins, Dingley and Shaw, who deolared that Parliamentary action was futile and Trade Unionism useless.   Unemployment could only be solved by mass action by tho unemployed, who must organise themselves with the object of seizing   closed mills and workshops at the right moment and running them for the benefit of tho workers.   They must carry on propaganda outside the Labour Exchanges.   Shaw added that he was not going&apos; to starve whilst there was plenty of food in tho shops.While the local Communists believe that the time is almost ripe for seising buildings, my correspondent, who knows Lancashire intimately, says that the mass of workers is not revolutionary,luring the week ending March-4-th, 18,415 men were added to the Lancashire and Cheshire register, making a total of 117,83c, while the women&apos;s total reached 18,488, an increase of 4,217.My correspondent in Liverpool reports that there is real suffering.   The annual report of tho Blackburn Weavers&apos; Association shows a loss of  35,909, 18, 9-fr., on the year.   The unemployment payment is the highest in the history of the Association.There is little change in Coventry, where many of the engineers have been out of work for six months.   Therelief/
relief scheme in Nottingham, where 800 men were employed in the construction of arterial roads, is nearly completed and 80 men were die change d last week,   While there is continued depression in the lace and hosiery tradess some improvement in the boot and thee industry is expected in Leicester,   Thio town was visited on March 13th by tho so-called President of the Edinburgh Unemployed Workers1 Committee, who is touring the country on a bicycle with the object of linking up unemployed organisations.At Huddorsfiold there has been some talk of seizing thi town lands as allotments, but at present there is little support from the textile workers.On the Tyneside unemployment continues to increase and j the Gateshead Labour Party is endeavouring to organise the unemployed.Mass meetings have been held in South Wales to persuade] the miners to pay the unemployment levy and In most oases this has succeeded.The unemployed    in the Glasgow area now number about 44,000 and there is acute distress.   The distribution of grants from the Lord Provost&apos;fj Fund, which has now reached  13,500, has little appreciable effect and the Corporation schemes to absorb the unemployed scarcely touch the fringe of the difficulty.   A number of evictions and attempts at eviction for failure to pay rent have been frustrated by John MoLean&apos;s group and in one case, that of an ex-Service man named Thompson, who was put back into his house by the crowdy/d, stron.: resentment was expressed. McLean&apos;s Party is said to be &quot;preparing for the revolution at the end of the month.&quot;   He ha3 been joined by C-ptain White, who is nearly as mad as McLean himself.Tho current issue of the &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; contains an article by H.M. Emery, who was convicted thisweek/
week, on &quot;Tactios for the Unemployed&quot;, in which he says !MTo the factories 11 is the only cry the capitalist fears. Your first move must be there.   If you, as a Committee, feel you could get an orderly march to a factory, then put it to your next mass mooting.   ......March if you can, butdo not risk a fiasoo.&quot;THE COAL MINERSThe national delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Groat Britain ratified the scheme of the Executive which provides for;National Coal Board to, govern wages and profits.Now 1021 wage standard, including all present   rates except War and Sankey wages.One-tenth of total standard wages to be $he owners1 minimum profit.Nine-tenths of the surplus to go to the miners and one-tenth to the owners.Q&quot;mers to establish a national profits pool. The conference will moet again to-morrow when the Executive will probably make some definite proposition:   if the moderatos manage to hold their own, a ballot is not unlikely.Trom taioashire, ray correspondent reports that there is little ohange in the attitude of the miners, but they seem to. hope that the Government will postpone decontrol at the, eleventh hour:   there is not much talk of strike action, but the gravity of the situation is fully realised.In the Midlands there is much hostile criticism of the Federation officials, but in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire the opposition to district rates is said to be weakening;   in the Warwickshire pits, however, which are.,, scarcely paying their way, the men favour a national rate. In North Staffordshire there is much opposition to the weekly unemployment levy of 2s. per member and la. per half member which was recently sanctioned by a delegates&apos; meeting, and feeling against the local officials, who are accusedcf/
of high-handed action, is running strongly.   Tho propagandist of the Unofficial Boform Cornittee are still active in the Midlands.In the Northumberland and Durham coalfields the feeling that no opposition should be offered to district rates is growing:   the danger of a strike in this area is largely dependent   upon the amount of the wages reduction.   Scarcely any collieries are now working more than three or four days a week and the Northumberland Association Is paying out approximately   ,000 por week in unemployment benefit.No change has been reported in the attitude of the Soutl Wales miners, who have boen chiefly concerned during the week with the unemployment levy, to the payment of which a good doal of objection has been rai3od.   Many of the miners have not paid their membership fees since the last strike,beoause they are dissatisfied with tho early exhaustion of &quot;strike pay&quot; funds.   If the South Wales Miners1 Federation take steps to enforce the payment of arrears, the question of non-unionism is likely to become highly, controversial.The &quot;rebel&quot; miners&apos; movement in Scotland has spread to the iothians and on March 12th a meeting at Bathgate of delegatos from 12 branches decided to act in conjunction with the extremists of Lanarkshire and Fifeshire.The Vfalton oase has disclosed the fact, that intimidation is rampant among the miners&apos; associations and that it Is impossible for a member to take any independent line politically or industrially against his officials, without the risk of persecution, which, not infrequently, takes the form of dismemberment, the miners1 term for expulsion. Several men, In this particular case, declined to give evidence, as by so doing they would have risked their means of livelihood.the/
fHE RAILWAYMANThe National Union of Railwaymen has issued a statement on the organisation of tho railways in which it proposes that they shall be State-owned, and managed by a National Board composed of an equal numbor of representatives nominated by Parliament and by the railwaymen acting through their trade union.   It is further proposed  that, in addition to the permanent machinery proposed by the Government, district boards should be establishod, and that the functions should embrace all questions arising out of the men&apos;s employment, including the questions of discipline and management.HE PRINCE Off WAXES1 VISIT TO GLASGOWMy correspondent in Glasgow reports that patriotism has been strongly stimulated by the visit of the Prince of Wales, whose &quot;democratic demeanour&quot; has stirred Scottish sentiment. He says that the real working olass strongly condemn the demonstration of the so-oalled unemployed.It appears that when His Royal Highness expressed his willingness to meet tho loaders of the unemployed and the Chief Constable made this known to the loaders of the Labour Party, the effect was to widon the breach which separates John McLean, the organiser of the hostile demonstration, and the Labour Party and to increase the existing animus.   It is believed that the Labour Party would be very glad to see John McLean laid by the heels.   As mentioned in another part of this report, he is now preparing for a &quot;revolution&quot; at the end of the month.INVICTIONOn March 11th H.M. Emery, the Coventry agitator, was sentenced at Birmingham to two months&apos; imprisonment in the Second Division for an act likely to cause sedition amongthe/
the civilian population. ItTHE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; 1George Lansbury has had his article on the &quot;Daily Hera Tenth Birthday&quot;, to vvhioh reference was made in my report ( 95, reprinted in leaflet form and it is being widely oircul together with a covering letter to trado union branches;   i 1 the latter Lansbury writes, &quot;I know you are overwhelmed witj this kind of application, but I should be vory much obliged you would very kindly read tho article and then put it bafo;j your members.   I shall be glad to send you as many collect!; cards as you feel you are able to use.&quot;SINN FEIN IN GREAT BRITAINThe campaign of arson in Lancashire and Cheshire oontii &apos; and the local authorities arc of opinion that all the fires!attempts to fire &quot;are undoubtedly the work of Sinn Feinerg.1IIFive men are in custody at Seaforth and one at Presoot. Tbl when arrested were in possession of loaded firearms and one! a life preserver, flhere were bottlee of paraffin and petrol! in the vicinity of the fires.On March 9th thirteen fires occurred between 7*40 p*ro. and 8.40 p.m.;   six on the outskirts of Liverpool, in the Woolton, Childwall, West Derby and Wavertree districts, and the remainder in Crosby, Wirral, Wallasey, Bidston and Aught My correspondent states that the fires are causing great al and uneasiness; most of the large farms, however, are now well guarded by day and night.   It is reported that in Bast Cheshire several farmers have received threatening letters, presumably from Sinn Feiners,and that members of two of the farms where fires have occurred have relatives in the Irish Auxiliary police.On March 13th the Irish Labour Party held the first   of a series of open-air meetings in Glasgow:   the speakers wereFrank/
It is reported that the Western European Secretariat ofthe/iPrank Duffy and Thomas- Nolan-Walshe;   Captain White is now in Glasgow and has joined forces with John Maclean1a gang; he made a wild speech on Glasgow Green on March 13th.Brian 0&apos;Kennedy, who is acting on behalf of Sean MacGraith, has circularised Irish Self-Deterniination League branches, appealing for increased membership, wider propaganda and &quot;a deepening of the spirit of patriotism and 3elf-sacrifice in every member.&quot;  Meetings have boon held undor the auspices of the League in Poplar, Fulhara, Highbury, Paddlngton and Pookham and a number of concerts have been hold.   On March 20th a meeting is to be hold in Battersea Town Hall at which Commander Kenworthy and Dr. MacGrogor Held of Clapham will speak against the alleged tyrannical acts of oertaln Government Forces in Ireland and &quot;the failure of the British Cabinot to meet the Irish poople with a view to bringing about an honourable settlement of the Irish question.&quot;Meetings have been arranged in many districts for St. Patrick1s Day and it is not unlikely that outrages may also be timed for the same occasion.IRELANDThe number of outrages during last week was 358;   of these 236 wore attributed to Sinn Fein and 4 were agrarian.   There were 20 murders arid 42 cases of attempted murder; 87 cases of robbery and highway robbery:   25 oases of intimidation:   6 attacks on police barracks:   13,members of tho Crown Forces were kidnapped or &quot;arrested&quot; by Sinn feiners.Several encounters between armed rebels and the Crown Forces occurred;   in Co. Leitrim , the latter successfully attacked an entrenched ambush position, killed six Sinn Feinors and captured one without suffering casualties.
\the/Phird International in passing a resolution voting la: sums of money for propaganda, made apocial reference to Ireland.   The resolution states that &quot;work depends direct on material help given by the organisation centres which be of actual assistance to the Sinn Eeiners in moments of necessity.   In Ireland the centres, and even the areas, at all on the side of revolutionary radicalism and it is only the nationalist nature of the party (coined by the leaders and only direoted against the English) which prevents the areas from placing themselves under the banner of the Thiri International,   Propagandists should, moreover, direct the1, activities among estate employees in the non-nationalist a Work among the various unions of demobilised men in Irelani should be oarried out in conjunction with the work among t unemployed and has the advantage of holding out prospects of obtaining adherents from individuals employed upon Mill Intelligence vmrk and of establishing oontact with the Corp of Officers     very restricted body among whom work is most difficult, but of great importance).&quot;Spaoial attention is to be direoted to spreading : propaganda among the troops: excellent material is stated to be provided by the stern discipline prevalent in the armies of Western Europo; also to the formation of a nucleus among technical troops, artillery, tank and armoured car unit3, m aeroplane depots, and no endeavours are to be spared to indu soldiers, particularly the senior ranks, to take an active part in the work.As regards the British Army it states that &quot;The extraordinary conditions of treatment, pay and strict discipline of the En^JLish Army do not leave muoh ground for hope of a quick success.&quot;
