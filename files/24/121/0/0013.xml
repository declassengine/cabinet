(P. J 404) From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, 2997IQLh March 1921.(Received 11th, 10 a.in.)Priority A.399 S.* Afghanistan. Following from Dobbs, 05 C, dated Dili March:-&quot;At present crisis I feel it necessary to bring to notice the recent striking,&apos; though intangible, increase of friendliness (? towards omitted) British and coldness towards Bolsheviks. When we first arrived, general Afghan demeanour was friendly. Shortly afterwards it became suspicious, guards and escort were increased, attendants changed on the ground of being too familiar, English-knowing spies introduced to our house, demeanour of some officers and soldiers verged upon insolent, populace ceased to salute, we were prevented from giving small gratuities to &quot;barber, coolies, &amp;c, for personal services, Kabul paper published nothing but anti-British news. (Corrupt group) Bolsheviks went about freely without escort, and were eulogised by officers appointed to attend us. I did not report on these signs as I did not wish to embitter the situation, but I protested vigorously to Afghans in private. About the time of the Accession Durbar, whole atmosphere changed, and, as already reported, contrast between general demeanour towards British and Russian missions was marked. Since then Afghan officers in attendance have frequently alluded to the uncouth behaviour of the Bolsheviks at the Durbar, and have hinted hostility towards them. Adul lladi has sent me a friendly letter from Bokhara. We have been encouraged to give small presents, populace salute freely, escort reduced to the bare minimum, soldiers respectful, prominent Colonels at Jalalabad used foul terms of abuse towards Bolsheviks, entirely satis I led in conversation with Fennell, Amir, Nadir and Tarsi sent frequent enquiries after our health, and there is general sense of goodwill difficult to convey. Amir&apos;s present of valuable carpet, which I find now is probably worth about Rs. 10,000, is another straw. I think this is partly result of Turkish Treaty discussion, partly our genuine desire to give (corrupt group) representation to India consequent on Duke of Conuaught&apos;s speech on opening of Assemblies, partly leakage of truth about Bolshevik regime and disgust at delay in ratification of the treaty, partly result of my revelations, and partly hope of influencing us to give liberal terms to Afghans. All these signs had increased my hope that, even if we were forced to admit Bolsheviks into political and economic competition with us in Afghanistan, such competition would be in the end innocuous, and we should be easy winners, ami ultimately with patience regain former influence. Decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore, profoundly disappointed me.&quot;
