Note. In the following notes the Occupied German territoryis designated throughout as the &quot;Rhineland&quot; and the part of Germany not occupied by the allies as &quot;Germany&quot; The frontier between the Rhineland and Germany is designated the- &quot;Eastern Frontier&quot; and the frontier between the Rhineland and foreign countries the &quot;Western Frontier&quot;.In pursuance of the Cabinet decision. Sir PhilipLloyd-Greame presided on March 23rd over a conference to consider the report of the Rhineland High Commission on the proposed Customs organisation of the Rhineland.   The conference was attended by representatives of the Vfar Office, the Foreign Office, the Board of Trafe^th^Cu^ems and also by Sir Harold Stuart, late High Commissioner.The conference first considered the general nature of the Customs regime to be instituted.   Attention was drawn to the probability that a severance of the Rhineland from Germany by a high customs barrier would llfitf? to the merger of Rhineland and French interests, and emphasis was laid on the great importance of avoiding any system which would give greater advantages to French goods sent to Germany over those sent from Great Britain and other allied countries. IMPORT DUTIES ON EASTERN FRONTIER.The conference approved the view of the Commission that the duties on the Eastern frontier should be mainly specific and based on the existing German tariff.   They took:HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ERITAHNIC MjtJESTYfS GOVERNMENT.reference Cabinet Minute It (21).INTER DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCE 0.1 theREPORT OF THE INTER-ALLIED RHINELhND HIGH COMMISSION.
.10 exception to the proposal that these duties should, in the first instance, be levied at the rate of &apos;25 per cent, of the present German duties payable in gold, but they were very strongly of opinion that the further proposal that these duties should be raised by rapid stages to the level of the German Customs tariff was open to serious objection(l) They recommended, therefore, that no such raising of the duties beyond the 25 per cent, level should take place without the definite approval of the Allied government so    Subject to this proviso it was thought that there was no great reason for levying lower duties on any particular description of good3*(2) It was recommended that goods passing from German^ through the Rhineland In transit should be ex-empted from Customs duty-(3) The question of duty to be levied on goods which;, after entering Germany from the East entered the Rhineland for consumption, was next considered     It was pointed out that such goods would pay duty twice, once on entering Germany and a second time at the new lower rate on entering the Rhinelanda     To this extent France and countries on the west of the Rhineland would secure advantages over countries on the east of Germany seeing that the natural routes from such countries to the Rhineland pass through Germany*   The -conference considered whether it would be possible to exempt such goods from duty on the Eastern frontiers but definitely rejected the proposal in view of the difficulty of securing that the exemption should in fact be confined to transit goods, and the risk that German goods might thus e^ade dutyo
(4) A further question was raised as to goods sent from the Rhineland to Germany for further manufacture and re-importa-tion into the Rhineland.    The conference were of opinion that the Commission might have discretion to exempt such goods from duty when re-imported over the Eastern frontier, but they thought it desirable that the British representative on the Commission should be instructed to refer home if he considered that any relaxation proposed was likely to prejudice British trade interests.EXPORT DUTIES ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER.The Commission has proposed an export duty on the Eastern frontier calculated on the amount of the German import duties but levied In paper marks instead of jpldj that is to say, a duty equivalent to about one-tenth of the ordinary-German Customs duties.     On free goods they propose a small statistical tax levied per paokage except that on dyes and pharmaceutical chemicals they suggest the ordinary German export tax (amounting In the Case of dyes to 10 per cent, ad valorem).     No objection was taken to these proposed ex-port duties so long as the Import duty on the Western front remains as at present; but it was considered that, in the event of duties on the Western front being lowered, it was essential that there should be a corresponding Increase in the export duties an the Eastern front so that the sum of the import duties an the Western front and the export duties on the Eastern front should In all cases be at least equal to the German Customs duty.    If this provision were not made, goods from Ifrance would be able to enter Germany at lower total rates than goods Imported into Germany over other frontiers.
IMPORT DUTIES ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

Subject to the above mentioned consideration, it was thought that the Rhinoland Commission might have discretion to reduce duties on the Western front if they considered such reduction necessary in the economic interest of the population of the Rhinoland.

IMPORT AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.

The question of the existing restrictions on importation into, and exportation from Germany has not been considered by the Commission in relation to the Rhineland, but the conference were of opinion that the Commission should be invited to consider and report on the system to be adopted in regard to such restrictions.

Licences to import prohibited goods into Germany are dealt with by the German Authorities on their merits, and it is obviously impossible that the system of licensing in the Rhineland should be carried out on the same principles as those adopted in Germany. Subject to any views that may be expressed by the Rhineland Commission, the conference were of opinion that there were good prima facie reasons for abolishing import restrictions altogether, but they were of opinion that, if such restrictions be maintained, they should be imposed equally on goods from Germany and goods from the rest of the world. They were even more definitely of opinion that all existing export restrictions should be abolished at once.



ORGANISATION AND STAFF.

The conference next considered the question of the necessary Customs staff for the carrying out of the sanctions proposed. In the absence of exact knowledge as to the requirements of the area they found it impossible to examine in detail   
the proposals of the Commission. They were however, advised that by Sir Harold Stuart that the main area in the British portion of Cologne ? which it was necessary to control was the industrial area west of a line drawn through Burg Burscheid, Durnwald and Cologne. While this appeared to be the main area to be covered in order to make the sanctions effective in the British area, it was considered that it would be necessary to watch any gap East of Cologne by linking it up with the French.

The Customs stated that one of their officers, Mr. Avison, was ready to leave at once and consider on the spot what organisation was necessary. It was therefore decided that

(1) Mr. Avison should leave at once for Cologne and should report as soon as possible on the following points:-

(a) What Customs posts it will be necessary to maintain.

(b) The strength of officials it will be required to have at each such port, distinguishing how many of these must be English and how many may be German.

(b) The total strength of the force of guards and patrols which will be required to cover the area, and the strength of each particular detachment required and the area for which each detachment would be responsible. He should also report how far this can be carried out by German guards recruited specially for the purpose, and how quickly such guards could be engaged. Sir Harold Stuart expressed the view that such requirement would offer no difficulties.

In this connection the representative of the War Office made it clear that the Army Council were strongly averse from employing British troops for this purpose. A note furnished by the War Office setting out their views is appended.

(2) British Customs Officers to the number specified in the Report of the Commission should be sent out, unless Mr. Avison telegraphs that a lesser number will suffice. Customs Officers for this purpose should be sent out as rapidly as they can be made available.

 
The War Office, should arrange to detail a Staff Officer to accompany Mr, Avison.The Foreign Office should oommunioate with the Customs at to where the Customs Officers despatched should report on arrival.The Conference considered it essential that there should be an adequate organisation ready to work by the 7th April,/Intldjf  P.L1.-G.24.3.21.&apos;
1. The two lines to be considered at the Rhineland High Commission:(a) The River Line.(b) A line corresponding roughly to the Easter^ perimeter of the Bridgehead.There Is, however, a third possibility, vis: a line corresponding to the inner line of defence of Cologne, following which line? the land front would be reduced to 10 miles.2. From a purely military point of view there are grave abjections to using troops on any form of Customs duty, such as the following:-(a) Dispersion and consequent entire cassation of military training.(b) Loss of discipline.(c) Passible temptation to connive at smuggling. Alternatively, danger- of fracas with peaceful inhabitants owing to ignorance of the language.td) Expense in maintenance due to dispersion.Behind all this there is the salient fact that we have no troops to spare.      It ia true that the proposal la to use a portion of the existing Rhine garrison, but haliT this garrison is earmarked as a reinforcement tn the ease of necessity for Great Britain, or even Ireland. There is, therefore, * danger that we might be forced to withdraw at short notice all troops engaged on Cujytonts^dirfcy*NOTE BY THE WAR OFFICE ON MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING TEE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CUSTOMS BARRIER IN THE BRITISH PORTION OF THE OCCUPIED TERRITORY.
3. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the River line as opposed to the Eastern perimeter line may he summarised as follows-:-(a) Concentration of troops on easily recognisable line.(b) Restriction of the Guards to a few definite points-Co) Patrolling of the river will probably be a simplermatter than patrolling a wide extent of forest country.(d) Simplicity of supply due to the fact that all troops would be prepared to concentrate on given oommuni-cations.The Eastern perimeter line has no military advantages to compensate for the above.    If, however, the river line is economically impossible, a compromise between the two is suggested in the shape of a Customs barrier following the inner line of defence covering Cologne, above and below which the river line to be adopted.    It is true that this solution would leave a portion of the British troops* e.g. those at Solingen, outside the Customs barrier, but this does not appear to be a serious matter.4* The above remarks consider the question merely from a military point of view, but due consideration must be given to the military difficulties when considering the economical advantages and disadvantages.    If, however, the employment *f soldiers can be avoided, the military objections, of course would fall to the ground.    In the opinion of the Army Council the employment of soldiers on Customs duty is not In accordanc with the traditions of the British Army, nor in the best interests of the troops.
