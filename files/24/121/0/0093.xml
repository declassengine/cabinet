5*0OAB.ISBT,MKM0R4NDU1 BY TBS KLNXSTSB CEP LABOUR,(apart from the situation In tho eoal trade), beoause it is important to note dearly the possible effect upon general laseur opinitn ef the allegation that the miners11 difficulty is part of a general attempt by employers to reduce wages. The attached meaorandiua, shewing briefly for some of the prinoipal trades in the country howmatters now stand in those trades se far as regards wages, has teen prepared accordingly.   It is, of course, inevitable at the present time that meney wages should fall; tut in many of the. principal trades the faU is taking place in accordance with agreements ho twee n the parties that wages should so regulated en a sliding soale oasis either according to the selling price of the product (for example, the iron and steel trades), or according te the cost ef living.   In ether industries re-adjustmente ef wages are being discussed by the appropriate joint bodies (Joint industrial Councils, Conoiliation Boards, etc.)    There are one or two very diffioult situations (for example, shipbuilding], hut I am not unhopeful in regard to these that it may be possible to avoid a Breakdown.The position of unemployment, which has been growing steadily worse throughout the last few months, is, of oourse, hound to have a very serious effeot upon the situation.  While on the one hand the fear of unemploymenttends to retard the occurrence ef minor strikes, the continuance of unemployment on a large scale, and for a pro-longed period, exhausts the resources of the workpeopleS30HETI think it may be useful to my oolleagues to have some indication of the present general Industrial situation
ooncerned and tends to set up an element of dosperatlon. There are already ovor l  million persona unemployed;   the minors&apos; strike means that between 1 million and l\ million miners are out, and it means, of course, the throwing out of work immediately of K&apos;ery largo numbers of men engaged in oooupations where large quantities of coal are required. Probably, therefore, apart altogether from the threatened action by the Triple Alliance, we have immediately to face a total of about 4 million persons unemployed; this number will, of course, be increased materially day by day.I think it is important that a lead should be given on behalf of the Government, as soon as there is a suitable opportunity, of the kind that was given shortly after the outbreak of war9   It will be remembered that the Government thon announced publicly (with the concurrence of the Trade Unions) that the right way to settle the difficult questions of wages, cost of living, etc, which would be bound to arise as a result of the war, was not to go in for a policy of strike or lock-out, but to resort to arbitration.   This declaration, and the acceptance of the prinoiple by the Trade Unions, meant, that the wages conditions of Industry were regulated not by the extent of the economic power of labour but by the judicial dispensation of the Arbitration Tribunals. Just as at that time the Government tempered the play of economic forces, so should they now appeal to employers not to exercise to the full the economic advantage which they possess by reason of the slump in trade, eta., but to agree (in oases where they and the Unions fall to re&amp;eh an adjustment by negotiation) to allov* the question of tho re-adjustment of wages to rq to arbitration so that there may be an
-impartial and dispassionate review of the situation. That lead of this kind by tho Government would undoubtedly strengthen the hands of tho more moderate section among labour is shown by tho fact that the appeals that oertain Trade Unions made recently to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress for united action to resist wages reductions were met by a declaration by the Parliamentary Committee that, failing negotiation, use should be made of the machinery of arbitration.(IntldJ T. J, M.Ministry of Labour, 4th April, 1931*
PRESENT POSITION OF WAGES IN VARIOUS TRAPSS*Railways.      Wages questions affecting the traffic mon, etc., are dealt with by a joint body known as the National Wages Board from which casos not nettled can bo referred to a Central Wages Beard on which the Railway Managers, the Trade Unions and tho gonora] public aro represented.    Wages of traffic mon fluctuato with tho movement of the Labour Gazette coot of living index number.     Wages varying l/* por week for each five points alteration, in the index number..   In most casos, however, tho mon are protected by a post-war basis wage of about 100/&apos; over pro-war rates.    No Immediate diffioulty exists, but Railwaymon are anxious on account of statements made by certain Chairmen of Railway Companion that when tho industry is decontrolled next August an attaok on the new standards and on this national basis -of settling wages may bo made.As regards Railway Shopmen, negotiations are in progress for an arbitration which will settle the wages of orafte-men in the whole of tho Railway Shops in the United Kingdom. Transport Workers.    Tho policy of the National Transport Workers&apos; Fodoration Is to secure for tho different branohos of transport work national Joint bodies for sottling industrial problems. There are, for instance, a Docks Joint Industrial Council and a Trams Joint Industrial Council.    There is also a National Maritime Board for seamen, and the Transport,Workers1 Federation arc interested in othor Joint Industrial Councils.&apos;Tho position in the main branches of transport work is as follows r-Dooks.    Tho wages and conditions of employment of dock labour throughout Great Britain wero settled in May 1920, by the Report of a Court of Inquiry set up by tho Minister of Labour under the chairmanship of Lord Chaw of Dunf ermline.    A national minimum, was/of
5^ 4of 16/- per day is In operation and a National Council for dealing with wages and oonditions of employment exists. Suggestions have &quot;been mado by the Dock Employers for a meeting of tho National Council to consider a revision of dockers1 wagesj this meeting will take place in the second woek in May.     It should be noted that owing to tho slump in shipping there is considerable unemployment among dock workers. Tramways.       A Joint Industrial Council has for some timeouooesDfully regulated the affairs of tho Tramway Industry. At tho ond of 1920 thoro was difficulty in reaching agreement on a wagos matter and a Court of Inquiry was sot up under the chairmanship of Sir David Harrol by the Ministar of Labour which has recommended unanimously that tho present rate of wageo be maintained until the end of 1981.     This recommendation will shortly bo considered at a meeting of the Joint Industrial Council.Road Transport.        The attempt to secure a national settlement of wages has not been successful here.    Notice of reduction of 4/- a week has boon given in the London area.    Negotiations with the Transport Workers1 Federation and tho Carting Employers are being conducted by the Ministry of Labour.Shipping.       Wageo in tho Shipping Industry were regulated by control of the Ministry of Shipping and vory big increases, including risk money, wore added to the standard wage for all classes.    Tho Employers1 sido of tho National Maritime Board have proposed a reduction of  4.10s. a month for most classes of seamen, and a revision of overtime conditions.    The present rato is  14.10s. which includes  3 for &quot;war risk&quot; money and excludes food ond lodging on board ship.     The proposal is being considered by the Seamen&apos;s Unions,/Building
Building grade    Wages in this trade have been reflated for a long time by elaborate national machinery.      2?his oaohinery la being- somewhat revised at the present time to give the national body greater authority as compared with the district organisations.      &quot;Wages in this trade are at present very high, but negotiations are proceeding on a proposal for a reduction based on the Labour Gazette cost of living index number.    It la at present being considered by the Unions.   The proposals of the Employers would result, if the oost of living figure reaohod pre-war levels, in a permanent inorease of abour 33Jk over pro-war wages.Ihe arrangements for introducing 50.000 unskilled ex-Servioe men into tho industry to be trained as craftsmen are practically completed.    It remains to be seen whether the Unions will co-operate or oppose the echooe. If they oppose it there will be a oertain amount of unrest in the Building Industry.Engineering.      Wages in this industry are settled by agreements between the Employers&apos; federation and tne Trade Unions oon^eraed.   At present fin a rcement exists with all the Unions except tne Amalgamated Engineering Union, which terminates on the 16th June.    The Employers faav&amp; given the Unions formal notice of a reduction of &amp;/- per week to time-workers and 15$ in the ease of pieceworkers, as well as the oeesation of the bonus of IZfyf and 7]$ on earnings.    ICaey have Issued ior the informa-W*on of the Unions a long printed note on the economic position of the industry.Shipbuilding.     Eages are settled oy agreements between the Shipbuilding Employers1 Federation and the Trade Unions concerned.   At a conference last week the Federation proposed a reduction of 6/- a week in/them iw
tho case of time-workers and 15); in the case of piece-workers; they also gave notice to take off certain special advances given during the war to rivatters, platers and smiths.   Bhs Unions have refused to aooept the reduction,  he Minister of Labour is in touch with the parties to this dispute. he situation is diffioult particularly because the industry is short of work.  Moreover, the Ships Joiners have been on strike for nearly four souths against the withdrawal of an advance of 1ZJ- per week given to them in April, 19^0 in order to induce them to remain in the shipyards rather than to migrate to house building work where higher wages wero obtainable.Iron and Steel Trade.    Wages are based on ascertained selling prices of certain kinds of iron and stool.   Considerable reductions have already boon made, operating from the end of iviaroh, and more reductions will follow on further cute in selling prices.   There is no roason to suppose that the Trade Unions in this industry will resist the downward operation of the existing agreements for regulating wages.Woollen Trade.     Wages in this industry are regulated by a Joint Industrial Council which has made an agreement to provide for fixed base rates (higher than those in force before the war) with a bonus fluctuating according to the labour Gazette oost of living index number.   In the latter element of the wage, three reductions involving approximately 9s/- a week in the case of men and 6s/- a week in the case of women, have already been effected,Cotton.Trade.      The existing agreement between theEmployers1 ^derations and the Trade Unions expires on May 6th.   In view of the slump in the Cotton Trade a considerable reduction of wa^se is anticipated.   In
aooordanoe with the usual practicef there is no doubt that joint conferences to discuss the future wage position will shortly be hold. Chemical Trade.    The Joint Industrial Council has within the last few days discussed the future wage position and new minimum standard rates involving a reduction of about 2d. an hour have been put forward by the Employers,   It is expected that they will be aooepted by the menTs Unions, among whom is the Bookers&apos; Union, an important   element in the National Transport Workers1 federation.   The situation will again be reviewed in July.Sas Industry,    tfages are regulated by a Joint Industrial Council.   There is no proposal before the Counoil for a general reduction in wages.   The Council is at present classifying the various undertakings in a number of grades, with a separate wage basis for eaoh grade.Bleotrloal Trades Onion.    There is no important movement in progress affecting the ,/ages of the members of this Union but it would of course be intimately concerned in any general outbreak.
