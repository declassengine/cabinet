CONCLUS- The Law Officers are of opinion that theIONS 1 to 4 Agreement is exhaustive of the Governmentsliability under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, and that the Companies will be unable to maintain claims for compensation under that Act beyond what is provided for under the Agreement.They are further of opinion that the Com-panies cannot support claims, under the Ministry of Transport lot, 1919, to eempen-sation for alleged reduction in revenue earning capacity, except that insofar .as any such reduction is duo to acts of the Minister, and Sir Erie Geddes said h^ was clear that the balance was not against him under this head.As claims under these heads have not yet been formulated by the Companies, no immodi-ate action on the part of His.Majesty7s Government is called for..The Law Officers have advised that the Minister of Transport is entitled in law to disallow maintenance charges in excess of the 1913 standard unless such charges can be justified as being due to abnormal circum-stanees, and that he is loyally entitled to make deductions from monthly claims and to disallow future claims until the excesses are adjusted or justified.In this connection the Minister of Trans-port is advised that he cannot legally demand a cash refund until the final settlement with the Companies at the end of the period of control.RECOMMEND-AH ON 1: EXCESS KilNTEN-AiJOE.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT in the absence of the ^, Attorney General, summarised the opinion of the Lay officers,obtained in accordance with the decision of the Committee at its previous meeting, and stated the action which, in pursuance of the opinion, he had already taken or proposed to take, on the various conclusions and recommendations set out on pages 33 and 34 of the Colwyn Committees Report.     The statement in question may be briefly summarised as follows
The Law Officers advise that it is clearly open to the Government as a matter of law to carry out the recommendation of the Colwyn Comm-itteo that such payments should be discontinued.The Minister of Transport accordingly proposes to discontinue payments on account of arrears.The Colwyn Committee recommended that the Companies should utilise funds already paid to them (amounting now to approximately  4 ,000,000) before receiving further paymonts through the monthly claims cn account of the additional cost of arrears of work overtaken.The Minister of Transport accordingly proposes to act on the advice of tho Colwyn Committee and to make no further payments to any Company on account of the additional cost of arrears over-taken until the funds already accumulated by that Company have been disbursed.The Law Officers advise that the &quot;Agreement&quot; whioh the Colwyn Committee regard as inequitable is not a legally binding Agreement but is a mutable arrangement, and that it is open to His Majesty^ Government to endeavour to negotiate a settlement on the lines of the Colwyn Committo.eTs Report,The Minister of Transport has already informed, tho Companies that in future charges for excoss maintenance will he disallowed until justified, and that excesses on one Abstract will ho set against deficiencies on another,   insofar as this action doss not suffice to effeot the necessary adjustments, the Minister of Transport proposes to make deductions from the Companies&apos; monthly claims.
RSCOi:?.fEHDATIOII 5.AMOUIAL T&apos;;EAR ABfD 31The law Officers&apos; Opinion endorses generally the recommendation of the Colwyn Committee. No claims in respect of abnormal wear and tear have been allowed, with the exception of one admitted sneoisllv in 1916.^COMMENDATION 6.INTEREST ON CAPITAL SPEKDITURE.SCOIffiNDATION 7.8EPLACEMSNT OF TORES.The law Officers are reconsidering their Opinion, end nothing arises at the moment.     The matter is relatively unimportant.The Law Officers advise that it is not possible, as a matter of lev;, to set aside the agreement as to replacement of stores, but that tho circumstances surrounding this agreement may afford a justification for its statutory modifi-cation.The Minister of Transport stated that he had had indications from the Companies that they will not press their claims under this agreement.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT stated that he was anxious o to hove confirmation from the Cabinet of the action which he had already taken, and approval of the action he pro-posed to take.     He anticipated that as a result of that action the Government would be attacked by the railway interests, who would represent themselves as being sub-jected to harsh treatment, in which circumstances it was necessary that he should have the Cabinet1s unquali-fied support.     The Committee and tho Cabinet could rely upon him to proceed as carefully as possible in order not to place the Companies in an unreasonably difficult position.     The Minister of Transport pointed out that some  170,000,000 to  200,000,000 was&apos;involved in this question, and stated that he was sanguine that, having established the position of the Government by the action which he proposed, he would be able to negotiate an agreed settlement with the Companies, as a result of which the
V kamount ultimately paid to the Companies would be very much reduced.     In order to negotiate such a settlement success-however,fullyJ it would be necessary for him to make certain con-cessions to the Companies, the nature of which he would pro pose to communicate to the Cabinet verbally. The Committee agread -To recommend to the Cabinet that the Minister of Transport be authorised to take action on the lines proposed by him.Whitehall Gardens, SeWrl. March 15th, 1921.
