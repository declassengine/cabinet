Translation.!To.   VIII   J *   1212.-$mi------3erlin,March 10, 1921.Sir,I have the honour to send you herewith Memorandum regarding the sanctions which the Allied Powers have decided to apply to Germany, with the request that you will &quot;be so good as to forward them to the Council of the League of Nations.I have the honour to &quot;be, etc. (Signed)   DR. SIMONS.Minister for Foreign Affairs.ToThe Hon. Sir James Erie Drummond,K. CJ.G. ,CB,, Secretary-General to the League of nations.
Copy to VXXI   J.   1212,Translation &quot;by the Secretariat from the German original,HEaMOBAflDIIM.In accordance with a decision taken by the four Principal Allied Powers and Belgium, Belgian, British and french troops have crossed the frontiers of the territory which may &quot;be occupied under the Treaty of Versailles^ and have taken possession of Duisburg, Ruhrort and Dusseldorf. The Allied (Joterninento have further declared that they will retain a definite amount of all payments owed &quot;by their nationals for German goods *     Finally, they propose to institute their own customs regime in the occupied Hhine territory.This action on tho part of the Allies is contrary to the Treaty of VersaillesThe Allies allege that Germany has infringed certain stipulations of the Treaty w f,li regard to war criminals, to disarmament and to the first payment of twenty milliards., They call their measures sanctions justifiable under thestipulations of the Treaty.   They do not say which stipulations are implied.There can only &quot;be a question of the three following;-1,   Paragraph 18 of Annex II to Part VIII. 2.   The final Paragraph of Article 429 and 3.   Article 430* To &quot;begin with, none of the stipulations permits tho further occupation cf German territory beyond the district west of the FCuine and the &quot;bridgeheads*Ac cox ding to -Article 429 s        evacuation of the occupying troops may cnly be delayed if at the date of   the
expiration of the occupation the -Allied and Associated Powers do not consider the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by Germany as sufficient.   According to Article 430 evacuated territory may &quot;be re-occupied if Germany refuses to observe her Obligations with regard to reparation,   Ho right to occupy German territory can in any way be based upon paragraph 180   This para-graph deals frith economic and financial prohibitions and reprisals and &quot;in general frith such other measures as the Allied and -Associated Powers may determine to bo necessary under the circumstance-stances&quot;c   Occupation is the harshest conceivable measure for scouring the observance of a Treaty?   It is therefore circumstan-tially prescribed under a special part of the Treat? of Peace, namely Part XIV which includes Articles 429 and 430, and is appli-cable specifically in the case of failure to observe obligations v;ith regard to reparations.   It, would be preposterous to assume that the general wording of the last part of paragraph 18 would justify an oocupacton of territory beyond that laid clown by the stipulations of Pare XIVQ   On the contrary, it can only be a question of economic measure3*    According to paragraph 18 even such economic sanctions may only be applied in case of default in the performance of the obligations with regard to Reparationsa   The British Treasury -expressly recognised this in the note of January 6? 1321, which is enclosed herewith,.   This stipulation does not, therefore, apply to infringements-of the provisions with regard to war-criminals . or - disarmament *   There, is no breach of the obligations&quot; with.regard -to.Reparations* The time limit within which,. In sccordance-wlfh-Article :Z35j.bhe.. sum of 30 millions is to be paid to the Allies in specie or in kind, has not yet orpiredo   According to the German estimates,, the German payments in kind have already reaches the stipulated amounto   There can be no question, therefore, of any wilful breach of the Treaty^
The second sanction announced, i.e. the partial oon-fiscation of the purchase price of German goods, would, in fact, be in contradiction with assurances expressly given by the Belgian and British Governments with regard to the non-applica-tion oi paragraph 18a   The declarations of both Governments are attached hereto.   The Italian Government had adopted a similar decision and communicate! it officially to the German Embassy at &apos;*ome.   This measure, uould,. therefore, apply neither in Belgiumnor in Italyi nor, in so far as bank credits arising out of the purchase of g&apos;OOds are concerned, in the United kingdom,   With regard to the third santion^ the introduction of a special cus-toms regime in the --Jhine Provinces is not applicable as a punitive measure, since article 270 of the Peace Treaty stipulates that it shall only be applied if such a measure is considered necessary in order to safeguard the economic interests of the population of the Shine Provinces,   On February 4th, the Prime minister of The ...rench Republic, acknowledged in the Jhamber of deputies that such a measure would pro beyond the stipulations of the Treaty^In addition to this, the Allj.es are not us inn the sanction for the purpose of enforcing the fulfilment of 1&apos;treaty stipulations which are alleged to have been infringed.   The Allies declared openly that the: resorted to the application of force because they hau&quot; formed the impression that Germany was endeavouring in bad faith to evade the obligations with regard to Reparation, which she had undertaken under the Treaty of Versailles,   By the appli-cation of these measures oi compulsion, they intend to induce Germany to submit to their proposals regarding t-ie manner in \:;hich her obligations for reparation are to be fulfilled. These proposals provide for a settlement of the question, which differs from the
provisions of the Treaty, There is therefore no obligation to accept them. The German ..-ov eminent, by its conduct, has given no ground for the assumption that it intends to act in bad faith.The Allies say that their action is inspired by anxiety for the peaoe oi the world,   In reality, however, it constitutes an unwarrantable violation or peace,In the establishment of the   eague of nations, which is intended to base the relations between States upon Justice and honour, ensure the scrupulous observation of treaties and make the rule oi right a reality, the chief purpose of its Members was the maintenance of world-peace. Accordingly, in Article 17, the Covenant of the league contains specific provisions for the case ox disputes between Members on the one hanC- and States which are not J.embers of the League on the other, provisions which aro intended to prevent resort to force until every means of peaceful settlement has &quot;been exhausted^The German Government, which is one of the sign- tories of the Covenant, requests the Council of the league to take the step incumbent upon it for bringing the methods of settlement provided in the Covenant into operation, and, with this in view, to cause the immediate abandonment of the violent measures applied by the Allies0   The German Government already fulfils the preliminary condition for the employment of the above procedure, inasmuch as, for the purposes of such procedure, it accepts the obligations of membership in the League0The procedure will show that Germany, inspired by the most earnest desire to fulfil her treaty obligations to the best of her ability, tua given no occasion for the disturbance of peaceosrlincMarch 10th, 191-51,
