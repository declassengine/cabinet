The latter is in many respects the most satisfactory form of payment if it can be made in the shape of goods that are needed and do not directly interfere with Allied industries.The Germans have suggested, and the suggestion has been en-dorsed with the Prime llinister!s approval, that they could contri-bute substantially by furnishing materials of all kinds for the rebuilding of the devasted area in Prance.   This is a form of pay-ment in kind which might be specially useful to Prance in so far as would enable her to restore the primary plant of economic life in that area.   Apparently, however, it hao not met with favour in Prance, on the ground that it is likely to interfere with the normal industrial   activities of the country.It certainly would be difficult in this country to find any outlet for a large free importation of German goods (apart from certain raw materials and dyestuffs already provided for) whichtwould not be open to the objection of aggravating the unemployment situation   But the objection does not hold good as regards-the rest of the Empire.   There the war, if it has not directly destioyed the primary equipment and plant of economic life, has certainly stood in the way of much needed extension.   The burden of debt on the $ominion^     and the scare4t^ariddearness of capital here, are serious obstaoles in the way of plans of development which, if carried out, would mean a great increase of their Capacity to absorb British &apos;&apos;H settlers, to buy British goods, and to play their part in the common defence of the Empire,.

ia not. so much direct war indebtedness, aa the inadequacy of local revenues to sustain the loans required for large devel-opment schemes, and tho inability of the overburdened British Exchequer to advance the money on thoir behalf.    Tanganyika territory, for instance, is in most urgent need of large capital expenditure to make good actual destruction caused during the East african Campaign and to bring it back to a condition of even approximately the samo well being and devel-opment as it enjoyed under German rule.   But the need is universal throughout tho Empire.That situation would be immensely relieved if the various Governments concerned could recelvo from Germany, without payment, all the materials required for the main framework of a policy of rapid developments   The goods most required would be rails, sleepers, bridgework, locomotives, structural iron for harbour works, possibly also sluices for irrigation pro-jeots, plates for lake and coasting steamers, mine equipment, etc. With a free supply of those articles it would bo possible to go in for a policy of development on a scale altogether beyond anything that could conceivably be undertaken without suoh assistance.It may be objected that these German goods would simply take employment away from our own producers of similar goods. That would be true if it were a case of buying German goods with money that would otherwise have bought British goods, or if these development projects could be oarried out in any evontg But the essence of the situation lies in the fact that the Governments concerned cannot carry out these developments as things stand at present.   On the other hand if unpaid German materials can provide the foundation for a great superstructure of rapid eoonomic development, the increased general trade we shall win will be something far larger than anything we could hope
&quot;... 83ho-o to seouro &quot;by clinging to a monopoly of the foundation work.   Taking it even from the narrower point of view of the industries directly affected: if by this means we can in a few years inorease the railway mileage of tho empire by 20,000 or oven by 103000 miles, the permanent employment afforded in th work of repairing and maintaining such a mileage would be far more than tho employment likely to be given now by confining ourselves to suoh small schemes of railway development as the various Governments can finance and making absolutely sure that these should be exclusively equipped with British material. In any case the suggestion is not so muoh to replace British by German materials for existing Schemes, as to lay out wholly now schemes only feasible on the assumption of the provision of free materials from Germany.As regards the financial assessment of these deliveries of goods, those sent to the Dominions would, in the first instance, presumably be set off against the reparation claims of the several dominions; any excess could be made a debit from the dominion concerned to the British Exchequer in respect ofits claim for reparation, and the same procedure could apply tothe goods furnished to Colonies, Protectorates or mandated territories.If the main idea of the suggestion here made commends it-self to the Cabinet it would be possible to communicate with the various Governments in the Bmpiro with a view to having a total list of requirements and a comprehensive scheme of Umpire development ready for discussion by tho Imperial Cabinet in June.(Intd) LoS*AoColonial Offioe0 11th March, 1921*
