Hon. D. Lloyd George, Q0l.tt 1-.P., 10, Downing Street, S.*7.Sir,On February 16th you were good enough to receive a deputation from this organisation on the subject of the price to be paid for British Wheat of the 1920 orop in accordance with the Govern-Mentis undertaking announced by you on 11th March,   1920.   Tho result of our interview on that occasion was that at a conference held on the following day (February 17th) at the Ministry of Agriculture, a scheme was put before us by the 1&apos;Inister of Agricul-ture, and Lord Crawford to carry out your promise which we accepted with entire satisfaction.Contrary to the expectations of the Conference, the National Association of Corn and Agricultural Merchants has failed to give the scheme a fair trial and has put forward an alternative scheme to provide for the certification by dealers of sales which took place between November 8th and March 5th.   Several weeks elapsed between the conference and the advancement of the alternative seheme and the result      ,that owing to the action of the Corn Merchants1 Association the original scheme has entirely broken down and cannot now be put into operation,For these rasons we are reluctantly compelled to take advantage of your invitation to return to you if any further question arose after our meeting with the Ministries.   I wish to emphasise the fact that this organisation was perfectly prepared to abide by the scheme originally propounded,,   The position to-day, however, is that after several weeks that scheme has been repudiated on behalf of the Corn Merchants in respect of sales through dealers between November 8th and !&apos;:arch 5th and our members are insistently pressing us to obtain some settlement of the matter.   In the circumstances we have no alternative but respectfully to ask you to give your consideration to the alternative scheme proposed by the Wheat Commission so that a settlement of a matter of very urgent importance to wheat producers may be reached without further delay.I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,(S,-(;d.) R..R. ROBBIES,President,
