(Sixteen days after the first meeting)This date is su^ested on account of Jsection 72, ru;der which Parliament j may be dissolved if less than halfthe total number of members take the J oath within fourteen days of thefirst meeting day. &apos; .       On the dsy fixed for the establishment of the two Parlia-ments a number of important steps will have to be taken, endproceedings for the elections will commence immediately.     Theconstituenoies are newly formed constituencies of wide extent,and the Hou.ie of Commons elections are to be conducted on theP.R. system.   Consequently, the procedure at the first elec-tions will be novel in several respects and unfamiliar tothe returning officers and thoir staffs.     It is intended alsothat the proclamation should be issued by a Lord lieutenantappointed under new Letters Patent.     It has therefore beensuggested that in order to avoid confusion Orders in Councilsenators.
adapting the existing election laws to the election t* the new Houses of C orations and regulating the election of senators-should be made and issued in advance of the day fixed for the establishment of the Parliaments, and that the new appointment of Lord Lieutenant should also be made In advance of that day. This would entail the fixing of an earlier date than the 3rd May, say, the 10th April, for the cowing into operation of the provisions of the Aot with respect to these Orders in Council and the new tenure of office of the Lord Lieutenant (ss.15 (2), 37, 69 and Fourth Schedule, Rule I).3.    A number of questions of great importance arise in con-neotion with bringing the Act into operation upon which rulings will be required either from the Cabinet or from a Committee of Ministers.    Some of the&amp;e arise upon the preliminary instruments which have to be issued at the outset, and call for a speedy determination;   for instance(a) First order fixing the appointed days.    For what purposes and for what psrovisions are the first days to be fixed?(b) Appointment of Lord Lieutenant.    Are there to be permanent Letters Patent, each new appointment being made by Commission, as in the case ef the Dominions, or are there to be separate Letters Patent on each new appointment, as at present?(e)   Formal instructions to the Lord Lieutenant.    What subjects are these to include?(d) When a Lord Lieutenant has been appointed under the new regime, can the office of Chief Secretary continue?    If not, what Minister is to answerfor Ireland in the House of Commons;.    Will it not be necessary to set up a new Ministry by statute?(e) Orders la Council yiegulating the election of senators and the registration of senatorial electors * Orders in Council applying the existing election laws and making arrangements for.the first meetings of the Parliaments, including the temporary appointments of speakers and officers of the Houses. A number of difficult legal and constitutional points arise on these.(f) Orders in Council providing for the contingency of either House of Commons not being properly constitu-ted and for &quot;the Crown Colony Government&quot; which will then supervene, including the consideration of the personnel of the executive and legislative bodiesto ba es tablisi?s 3 in that event.- s3 -
These find other questions vrLIX requ:&apos;ra-carax^^ tion, and time is pressing,,    It will be necessary to settle this question at sn early date as under the time table the Executive and Legislative powers in Southern Ireland will pass to these bodies on the 13th July next,, should the Southern House of Commons fail to materialise^I would asktf therefore, for the appointment of a Committee of Ministers to settle the draft instruments and decide questions arising on the bringing of the Act Into operation, with power to reserve for the Cabinet such matters as they think propera(Intd)    H.G.Irish Office, S.tf,March 16th 1921.
