doc149his britar.-i merit)From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, loth March 1021.3148(Received 1 Oth, 8 a.in.) Clear the line.372 S. Afghanistan. Your telegram of the 5th March, \o. 1343, and subsequent correspondence. Gravity of issues involved compels us to urge upon His Majesty&apos;s Government, with all earnestness, reconsider attitude they are at present disposed to take up over the Afghan problem, viz., insistence on (1) disclosure of Bolshevik agreement, and (2) elimination from it of subsidy or money grant, and, apparently, (3) of gift of arms. As regards first, demand for disclosure has now been made in private negotiations, and Tarsi has privately given implied promise to meet it. It remains to be seen whether he will adhere to this attitude officially, and not plead inability to do so until he learns alterations introduced into draft at Moscow. For the present, however, we need not pursue the point.As regards (2) and (3) (V we have), of course, the right to tell the Afghans that they will get nothing from us if they take arms or money from Bolsheviks.   But the real question is whether this would be expedient, in view of the costliness and dangers, both internal and external, of present lack of relations with Afghanistan. We are emphatically of opinion thai it would not; even if we could afford to make such a stipulation it would lie useless.   We do not believe that Afghan Government would ever accept this condition.   But even supposing, for the sake of argument, that in order to secure treaty and subsidy from us I hey engaged to take neither money nor arms from Bolsheviks, Bolshevik money and arms would, nevertheless, percolate; into Afghanistan if Bolsheviks are set on it.    Nor could we protest effectively, even supposing we got to know of each case.   Gifts of money would be represented as trade transactions, gifts of arms as purchases.    Inevitable upshot would be that we should have to (dose our eyes to breaches of our stipulations with affected unconcern,    (Corrupt group) therefore should be to base our treaty on tangibles (sic) (like exclusion of Bolshevik Consulates on our borders), and to eschew, as far as possible, stipulations we should be powerless to enforce.   We must beg His Majesty&apos;s Government to envisage facts as we see them.   Afghanistan is deter-mined to parade (sic, ? claim) her complete independence.   Krom this nothing short of war will drive her.   Hence, if we now attempt to base our policy on what is no longer practical politics, we shall not secure a treaty.   We shall be playing into Bolshevik hands, leaving them a free held, and a very fruitful field, for machinations against us.   In the event of rupture of our negotiations, the obvious probability is that Amir will leave no stone unturned to drive home to us the need for Afghanistan^ friendship by proving to us the disadvantages of the lack of it, intensifying Afghan intrigue and (? encouraging) Bolshevik activities among our tribesmen. The inevitable result would be increasingly dangerous situation on the frontier, rendering resumption of friendly relations with Afghanistan increasingly difficult.   At the worst it might easily lead on to war.   Can we, in view of general situation in the Near and Middle East, face an Afghan war ? &apos; *India cannot. And we must venture to remind His Majesty&apos;s Government that (? it omitted) is on India and Indian resources, financial and military, that the brunt would fall. Should it come to war, the more successful our operations the greater the probability of the downfall of the Amirate and disruption of Afghanistan into chaos and anarchy, thus proving (sic, ? providing) Bolshevism ready-made with those avenues of approach to India after which, she is now laboriously striving. In. a word, we still need good neighbourliness of a united Afghanistan in order to stabilise our frontier and as an outer buffer against Bolshevism, even though we cannot get it on &apos; the full terms Ave should have liked,We feel so strongly and unanimously on this vital matter that we deem it necessary to place our views in unmistakable plainness on official record. And. fortified by success of policy we steadfastly pursued in the face of much criticism in India and outside in keeping Afghanistan out of the great; war, we are assured that His Majesty&apos;a Government will not override our anxiously-considered and as anxiously reconsidered views on a matter so directly affecting India.We beg, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept, our policy of concluding a treaty with Afghanistan on the best terms we can secure on the lines of Dobbs&apos; draft, taking our final stand only on the prohibition of Bolshevik designs definitely directed against us. It is most important for us to clinch negotiations, if possible, before effect of Dobbs&apos; revelations has had time to wear off.
