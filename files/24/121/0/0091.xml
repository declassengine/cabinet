(THIS DOCUMSHT IS TK2 PH0P2HTY Oi1 EIS BHITANHIC HAJSSTJfS GOVESMEOT)1SBCfiST. C A BIHSt, S2790.25L9FII0TAI&apos; HISTORY ci? TH5 WAR. THE US^ OF TIP FrK^SB-CTGS qj. TH3 WAR COUIGIL,_war ^y:::^!..iz amp tjar cabinet,_Noto by tho soorotary, (Circulated hy eutbority of tho prime Minister).A dooiaion is required as to tho extent to which the proceedings of such bodies as the War Council, Dardanelles Committee, War committee , War Cabinet, Imperial upar Cabinet and Inter-Allied Conferences may bo mado use of in the compilation of tho official history of tho war.In the earlier parts of those histories the question has not arisen, since tho organs referred to did not exist.     in compiling tho later  volumes, however, it will bo found that an intslligibla comprehension of the Government&apos;a policy can hardly be roached without reference to the30 documents.      his, indeed, was discovered at a very early stage by the Dardanelles Commission which made extensive use of tho Minutes of the War Council.The question has already arisen to a certain extent in the preparation of Sir Julian Corbotfs second volume of the Naval and General History, which deals, intar alia with the Dar-danellos campaign.   I have, as a matter of fact (I think with tho verbal permission of Mr,, Asquith when he was Prime Minister, though I have no written authority) given Sir Julian Corbett personal and confidential access to the Minutes of the w-r Council of 1914-15u    As regards the use of this material 1 have made the following stipulations-:-(a).....
fa) He is free to quote the proceedings of tnewar&quot;      JO J Council in oases where they have actually boen published in the report of the Dardanelles or Mesopotamia Commission.   In every such case, however, he is to give ao his authority the : Report of the Commission and not the war -Council Minutes.(b) Whenever essential to his narrative he can (without quotation) use the proceedings of the War Council in order to indicate generally the motives for the policy adopted, but in no oaso should he mention the War Counoil&apos;s proceedings as the source of Ws authority.(o) Ho should never mention a decision by the War Counoil, (except as provided in (a)) but should speak of a decision roy the Government&quot;.(d) Except as provided in (a), he should on noaocount give any indication of the views expressed &quot;by any individual member of tho War Council.Sir Julian Corbett constantly refors to mo, and has been most careful in following my odvico in using material of this kind from-the very first and no ono has complained of any indiscretion in tho first volume, whero a somewhat similar, though loss delicate problem arose as to the use of the proceedings of the Committee of. Imperial Defence,.I venture, therefore, to request that the action I havealready taken as regards the use of the material of tho warCouncil may be confirmed and that I may bo given, a reasonablediscretion to give tho official historians access, so far as I deomnecessary, to the proceedings of the war Council, DardanellesCommittee, War Committee, War Cabinet, imperial far cabinet, and allied Conferences, subject of course to reference to the primeMinistor or other Ministers in cases of doubt or difficulty*(Ogd,) J\L.P,A.
