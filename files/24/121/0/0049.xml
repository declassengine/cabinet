[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]------ -^25Printed for the Cabinet,   March 1921.SECRET.CP. 2749.RAILWAYS BILL.Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Minister of Transport.IN my memoranda under date the 9th February and 1st May, 1920, I put before the Cabinet my proposals on the subject of the future Railway policy.In effect the policy proposed was the substitution of a well-regulated monopoly in large territorial areas for the present system, which is no longer conducive to efficient and economical working.I suggested the formation of Railway Groups with power to the State to secure the public interests, with a system of charges fixed by a competent Tribunal upon the basis of a fair return in revenue and made subject to periodical review. This is fair alike to the Railway Companies and to the community, and is the best means to secure efficiency and economy. No scale of statutory maxima could, under existing abnormal conditions of cost, be compiled.Upon receiving Cabinet approval to this general policy I put myself in communication with the Railway Companies and with representative bodies of traders, with whom 1 have discussed it very fully.I have in my previous memoranda dealt with the urgency of the problem and the conditions which render it imperative that legislation should be passed this year.The Railway Companies are now in receipt of a guarantee from the State which terminates at midnight on the 14th August this year, and the reasons I gave for the necessity for legislation are as cogent now as then.The general position under the Railway Agreements consequent upon taking over the railways for purposes of the war is described in my memorandum upon that subject dated the 11th February, 1921, but I ought perhaps to remind my colleagues that the original Agreement guaranteeing the net receipts of 1913, which was limited to the term of possession, was extended in 1910 by Mr. Runciman, acting on behalf of the Government of that day, to two years after the termination of the war. Mr. Runcimans undertaking wTas held to be fulfilled by the provision in the Ministry of Transport Act, under which the Government took upon itself a, statutory obligation to retain possession for two years from the passing of the Act on &quot; the same terms as to compensation as those theretofore in force.&quot;The rising costs due to war conditions impaired the abilifcy of the Railway Companies to earn their net receipts of 1913 (145,000,000 in Great Britain), and with a view to restoring financial equilibrium goods rates were increased on the 15th January, 1920, and as expenditure, and especially wages, continued to rise, further increases in rates and considerable increases in fares were imposed in August and September last.The Railway Companies seek to impose upon the Government responsibility for the present level of railwaymen&apos;s wages, and it is therefore necessary to point out that in May 1920 the National Wages Board not only endorsed past increases, but recommended additional concessions which involved an annual expenditure of  7,000,000 in improvements of rates of wages alone. This Board was a body independent of the Government, and included, besides the independent Chairman, four General Managers, of whom three signed the Report, and four representatives of Trade Unions and four representatives of the users of the Railways, two of the latter being large traders Sir Thos. Robinson, M.P., and Mr. Manviile, M.P.The increases in rates and fares introduced in August and September last were calculated on the conditions then prevailing to restore financial equilibrium, and also to recoup the accrued deficiency in respect of the months April to July 1920, by the end of the period of possession.[5933] B
Unfortunately, the Coal Strike, the disturbances in Ireland, and more recently the sudden and sharp depression in trade have exercised a disastrous effect on Railway Revenue and the hopes of financial equilibrium have not been realised.The position for the year 1921 is difficult to forecast and is still under discussion with the Companies, who anticipate a serious deficiency for the first seven months of the year. The figures have not yet been agreed, but the depression in trade loaves no doubt that the full 1913 net revenue will not be earned in 19*21. That revenue was the highest the Railway Companies had ever received, and they are still continuing the high standard of maintenance which they were thus able to achieve in 1913, and this high standard is being paid for by the State at current abnormal prices. But for the existing Guarantee there is no doubt that the Companies would have materially reduced their maintenance costs in the present conditions of falling trade, and the net revenue would thus have been materially increased. The position is inherent to the agreements entered into by our predecessors.In considering the immediate situation, it must be borne in mind that the interim increases in rates and fares have been made on a percentage basis and not upon a systematic plan. The systematic revision of rates involves a prolonged and difficult enquiry, which is still in progress. The result is that in the increased rates and fares intended to restore financial equilibrium to the Railways as a whole, all Companies have not benefited equally. For example, fares have risen only by 75 per cent., as compared with an average of 112 per cent, in respect of rates for goods traffic, and the predominantly passenger lines have, therefore, not benefited so much as those whose main business is in freight traffic.The standardisation of wages has also disproportionately increased the rates of working expenses to receipts of those Companies which in the past were able to maintain a low wages basis. The position of Companies in the proposed Scottish, Southern and Eastern Groups illustrates these points.The Railways have asked for a continuance of the guarantee until the proposals contained in the Bill become operative. To this application I have replied in the negative. The draft Bill provides for a temporary pooling of receipts by the Companies themselves. This pool will mitigate some of the inequalities which might otherwise arise between Companies in the interval between the termination of the guarantee on the 15th August next and the date of amalgamation (the 1st January, 1923).It would be impracticable to leave the Railway Companies to revert individually to their pre-war position. In order to secure the permanent financial stability of the Railway Companies, a consolidation of railway interests is essential. It is necessary to reform fundamentally both the organisation of the railway system rand the machinery for fixing rates. To effect this, legislation is now required, and I believe.that, subject to a return to more normal conditions, my proposals will enable the new groups, with due care and efficiency in management, to earn an adequate return upon their capital and to provide the necessary facilities for the trade of the country at rates and charges lower than those to-day obtaining.As regards the financial positions of the Companies after the discontinuance of the Government Guarantee on the 15th August next, and until trade and costs reach a more normal level, I will explain verbally to my colleagues the views I hold.There is a measure of agreement both on the part of the Railway Companies and on the part of the traders with the broad principles of grouping and the fixing of actual rates by a new Tribunal with elastic powers, but there are important details upon which there is not agreement.The proposals regarding management of the Grouped Companies, particularly the introduction of employees as directors, will be contentious. There is wide divergence of opinion as regards the nature and extent of the future powTers over railways which are to be vested in the State. There are also substantial objections to the proposal for division between the Railway Companies and the State of the revenue surplus to that which may be fixed as the fair net revenue for each of the Groups and the formation of a development fund out of the proceeds of the State&apos;s -share in the surplus.The Railway companies object to the provision of a fund upon the ground that if&apos; the State share in the profits they ought to share in the losses, and they are apprehensive that such a fund might be used for purposes detrimental to them. The traders object to being called upon to pay by way of Railway charges for
0 something more than the value of the services which they receive. There is some force in these objections, and a substituted scheme for dealing with such surplus revenue has been evolved with which I will deal later.The Bill which I now submit gives effect in the main to my proposals which received Cabinet sanction.The principal features of the Bill are: 1. The formation out of the Railway Companies now in existence of [five] new Companies by the amalgamation of the larger Companies and the . acquisition by the Companies so amalgamated of the smaller under-takings.   The Groups thus formed are specified in the first schedule to the Bill.2. The future powers which the State is to exercise over Railways.8. A Tribunal to fix the charges which are in future to prevail on the new systems and to form a ready means of deciding questions arising between traders and Railway Companies or between Railway Companies.4. The determination of a standard net revenue for each of the new Companies upon the basis of which the new charges are to be adjusted by the Tribunal.5. The disposal of surplus revenue.6, Future management.7. Machinery for settling labour disputes.8. Abolition of the Light Railway Commission and the merger of its powers in the Ministry of Transport.1. Formation of Nciv Group Companies.The principle of grouping is accepted both by the general body of traders and the principal Railway Companies.The latter, however, object to the complete financial fusion which I consider to be essential if full advantage is to be obtained of the economies of which the new system will admit.They agree that economy and efficiency will result from operation as one unit of the Railways in each of the large Groups and will probably propose the establish-ment of Joint Managing Committees for each Group formed from the Companies composing the Group. But they will, I think, press for absolute amalgamation to be omitted, it being left to the Companies in each Group to amalgamate or not in the future as they may think fit. Under this proposal the Railway Companies would reap all the advantages of my proposal, but the community would not.The original groups which I suggested have undergone some modifications. I have omitted the London Group which comprised the passenger carrying Railways local to London, such as the District Railway and the Tube Railways.The competition between these Railways, Omnibus Services and Tramways makes the problem one which is better dealt with as a whole under some scheme for London traffic than as part of the General Railway problem, and I therefore suggest deferring any grouping or amalgamation of the local London Railways.I have also proposed to make one Group of the two Groups, the one comprising the North-Eastern Railway and Hull and Barnsley Railways, the other comprising the Great Eastern, Great Central and Great Northern Companies, so that there will be upon the East Coast one Group corresponding to the Group on the West Coast comprising the London and North-Western, Midland and Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways.The Railway Companies included this suggestion in an alternative system of Grouping which they put forward in response to my request for their observations upon the Groups as I had proposed them.The only other proposal they made was that the Scotch Railways should be divided between the North-Eastern and Eastern Group and the North-Western and Midland Group.This will result in the Scotch Railways being supported to a considerable extent at the expense of the public and traders using the Railways of the Groups. (J   to which it is proposed to attach them.It follows that opinion in Scotland is unanimously in favour of this proposal, but I see no good case for it.[5933] . . B 2 *
The Scotch Companies and the other supporters of the proposal will argue that the English Railway Companies, with the exception of the north-Eastern, are unanimously in favour of it. This contention will not, however, bear examina-tion, because the only English Companies really concerned are the North-Western and Midland Companies and the north-Eastern Company,The other Companies have only the remotest concern in the proposal.The North-Western and Midland Group would under the Companies&apos; proposal become possessed of the two more prosperous Scotch Companies, viz., the Caledonian and the Glasgow and the South-Western Companies, and also of the Highland Company, while the North-Eastern and Eastern Group would be saddled with the less prosperous Companies, viz., the North British and Great North of Scotland Companies.Further, the geographical position of the Scotch Railways does not lend itself to division north and south as in the case of the English Railways. The trend of traffic in Scotland is east and west. Also, the Scotch Railway rates are on a lower basis than the English rates and if grouped with English Companies they would have to come on to the same basis of rates as England. For this the Scotch Railway Companies are naturally prepared, but why the Scotch traders should be so penalised in order to enable the Scotch Railway proprietors to improve the value of their holdings is not equally clear.The general question of Grouping is of vital importance to the scheme, and I can explain verbally to my colleagues my views on this subject in greater detail than is possible in the limits of this memorandum.2. Future Powers of the State.I adopt as a principle that if the Government is to put the railways in a sound position by conferring upon them the monopoly of large districts and fixing charges on a basis which will secure them an adequate revenue, the Railways should be put upon terms to operate so that the maximum of economy and efficiency of working may be obtained and adequate facilities for cheap transport arid for convenience maintained to the public. &apos;At present the Railway Companies are in effect the sole judges of what services and facilities they will offer and how they will operate and extend their undertaking.The public while they have a right to apply to the Railway and Canal Commission to compel the Railway Companies to effect improvements in facilities which exist have no right to require a Railway Company to give new facilities or to extend their railways. The right is seldom exercised and lias not in practice proved of any great value to the community.I propose that when a public body of sufficient importance can establish a ease for it, the Government should have the power to require Railway Companies to give any services or facilities and to make such minor extensions or improve-inents of their undertakings as may be found to be necessary in the public interest.At present the Companies are without restriction, except upon questions of safety, as to the type and nature of rolling-stock they may use and each is at liberty to adopt any standard of works, plant and equipment it may think lit and to use its Railways and rolling-stock for its own purposes in its own way.I propose that powers should be taken to require, after adequate enquiry, common standards and the joint user of rolling-stock and plant. It is only by some such means that full efficiency can be secured and costs be kept at a minimum. The probability of an extension of electrical working makes it all the more important that a power to require common standards should be in existence.There is now, and may,still be after the reorganisation has been effected, wastefulcompetition between the Companies, which if the actual charges be stereotyped can be of no benefit to the community and should be prevented. It merely consists of an effort by one Company to divide with another Company traffic which can be adequately served by one of them alone. It causes needless cost and serves no useful purpose. There are no means now by which this can be prevented and 1 therefore propose to take a power to prevent it in the future. My idea is that each of the large Companies to be formed should concentrate on the development of their own territory and not embark upon competition with one another for the same traffic. The former is creative work, the latter purely sterile piracy.
3. New Machinery for Fixing and Settling Railway Charges.At present each Railway Company may fix what charges it likes within certain statutory maxima, subject only to the charges made being reasonable and not creating any undue preference or advantage to one trader over another.The proposal I make is that no maxima should be fixed by the Bill, but that the actual charges to be made should be fixed by a Tribunal before whom all parties interested in Railway Transport can be heard. At present it is impossible to fix any reasonable maxima because costs are so abnormal and unstable.The Rates Advisory Committee appointed under &quot; The Ministry of Transport Act, 1919,&quot; has held a long enquiry into the whole subject-matter, and have issued a report dealing exhaustively with the future method of fixing the charges for Railway Transport.The report has in the main been accepted both by the Railway Companies and by the traders, and as criticism of this part of the Bill will be upon minor details I do not think I need elaborate the scheme beyond saying that provision is made for fixing charges upon a basis that will give the Railway Companies a reasonable return if they work economically and efficiently.This proposition has been accepted by the traders, who are prepared to submit to such charges as will give the Companies &quot; a fair return.&quot;While accepting the proposal for abolition of detailed maximum charges, the traders feel doubt as to the complete abolition of the principle of a limit other than the economic limit. They press strongly for the retention of ultimate Parliamentary control over the extent to which the charges may be raised. I think it may be found necessary to make some provision under which there should be resort to Parliament, but it is difficult in the present economic conditions to suggest any definite limitation.I have included a provision in the Bill which takes the form of a direction to the Tribunal when first fixing the standard charges to fix a percentage above those charges to which they may, if necessity arises, make increases, but beyond which charges should not be increased without authority from Parliament.I wish, however, to discuss with my colleagues whether or not effect should be given in the Bill to this proposal of the traders.4. Future Revenue of the Companies.The proposals in my earlier memoranda were founded upon the proposition that the rates and fares on the Railways should in future be fixed upon a basis which would, with efficient and economical management, enable the Grouped Railway Companies to earn a net revenue substantially equivalent to the pre-war net earnings of all the Companies whose undertakings were to be comprised in the group.   This subject, as I then indicated, requires very close consideration.It is essential for the future prosperity of trade that the Railways should be maintained in a proper state of efficiency, and it would be false economy to fix a standard of revenue for the future which might have the result of making it in any way difficult for the Companies to find the money which they will from time to time require.At the same time it is necessary to secure that the revenue is not fixed on a basis which will impose upon traders and the travelling public a higher charge than is required to secure efficiency of transport.It has, I think, been accepted by the country that, if the Railway System is to continue and prosper, higher charges will be necessary than those actually in operation before the war, and in all the circumstances I think it would be equitable to adopt, as the basis for the future, the net revenue which the Companies earned in 1913, although the net revenue for that year was in excess of previous years, and adjust the new oowers of charge accordingly.There can be no reasonable ground for complaint by the Railway Companies if that year is taken as the basis of calculation, and, as I have already indicated, the traders are willing that a fair return should be secured to the Railway Companies for the future.1.I have therefore framed the provisions of the Bill so as to provide that the charges which the Railway Companies may make in the future shall be fixed at suoh a level that the new Group Companies will be able, with economical and efficient management, to earn a net revenue equivalent to that which they earned.
in 1913, together with an allowance in addition in respect of capital which had not then fructified, or which has been spent subsequently.This I propose to fix as a standard revenue, and to give such elasticity in the powers of the Rates Tribunal as will enable either a reduction to be made should the charges produce too large a revenue, or an increase to be made if the revenue produced is found to be insufficient.This will necessitate a close watch being kept on the operations of the Companies to secure that they are economically and efficiently managed, being neither unduly extravagant nor improperly niggardly in their expenditure.This can bo effected by the Minister of Transport by means of the accounts and statistics now rendered by the Railway Companies, and for the continuance of which I have made provision in the Bill.5. Disposal of Revenue Surplus to Standard Revenue.When a standard revenue has been fixed for each of the new Group Companies it will be necessary to make provision to secure that the new rates and charges, when fixed, will not produce a revenue substantially in excess of the standard, and, if they do, to determine in what manner the excess shall be disposed of.I have already referred to my original proposal of division between the State and the Railway Companies, and the objection which has arisen to it.I have, after full consideration, decided to propose to my colleagues a scheme for the application of the surplus to the reduction of the railway rates and charges, after allowing for a percentage being retained by the Railway Companies.By this method the public will be secured against a higher charge than is necessary to secure an efficient railway system, and the railways will be given an additional incentive to effect economy.I will explain by reference to figures and diagrams ihe effect of this scheme when I discuss with my colleagues the proposals of the Bill.0. Future Management.I have included in the Bill provisions to give effect to the proposals of the White Paper, Cmd. 787, that the Board of Management should, in the opinion of the Government, be composed of representatives (a.) Of the shareholders, who should form a majority on the Board, and of whom a proportion should hold large trading interests; and(b.) Of employees, of whom one-third might be leading administrative officials of the group, to be co-opted by the rest of the Board, and two-thirds members elected from and by the workers on the railway.The three main points upon which this proposal will be contentious are: (1.) The size of the Board.I propose twenty-one members, but it may be necessary to enlarge this number.(2.) The placing of officials on the Boards.This I consider most desirable to secure efficient direction, and I do not think that there ought to be much objection if it be recognised that the officials who will become directors should not also retain their office as officials.(3.) Workmen Directors.Labour is strongly in favour of this proposal; the official side of the Labour Party regard it as opening a prospect for them.My proposals are, however, limited so as to secure that only workmen who have actually been on the pay sheets of a Railway Company for a period of seven years shall be eligible. This will exclude the officials of the organisations, and will no doubt be objected to by them.The Railway Companies are strongly opposed to the proposal, and, the traders are officially silent on it, but there are many of them who regard it as introducing anew principle&apos;which may have far-reaching effects upon employers of labour generally.   Some are against and some in favour of the idea generally.
There are three courses open, one to fix the directorate of the new Companies by the Bill and thereby introduce matter of a seriously contentious character; another to leave it to the Tribunal by whom the new Companies will be formed either with or without a general direction to so provide that there shall be expert Hail way officials on the Board and that the workmen shall have some voice in the management of the undertakings; and the third, to drop the proposal and let the directorate be provided by the shareholders of the Company in accordance with the existing practice.I desire to discuss with my colleagues the policy to be adopted. It is highly contentious.7. Machinery for Settling Labour Diqmtes.The existing scheme of a Central Board and a National Board which was settled as a result of the meetings with the Unions after the strike of 1(.)1(.), and accepted both by the men and by the Railway Companies remains operative only for so long as the Railways remain in Government control, i.c, until the 15th August this year.It comprises a Central Board composed of ten members, five nominated by the Railway Companies and five by the Unions, three being nominated by the National Union of Railwaymen and two by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. To this Board any disputes affecting the wages and conditions of employment of Railway Workers as a whole are referred. If the Central Board cannot settle the dispute it is referred to a National Board consisting of four Railway representatives, four representatives of the Unions (being in each case others than those on the Central Board) together with four representatives of outside interests.The Chairman of the National Board is appointed by the Government.It was part of the agreed scheme that no strike should take place until one month after the reference from the Central to the National Board of a dispute which the former were not able to settle.As these arrangements terminate on the expiry of the period of Government control, I propose that they should be continued by the Bill as a temporary measure.Machinery was in existence prior to the War comprising Conciliation Boards constituted in 1911 when the Conciliation Scheme set up in 1907 was revised. The Boards under the 1911 Scheme consisted of representatives of the Company and of the men, the latter elected for the various districts on a sectional basis, with an independent Chairman who was to be called in if the two sides failed to agree.The functions of Conciliation Boards were to deal with any question relating to rates of wages, hours of labour, or conditions of service, other than matters of management or discipline.Neither side were satisfied with this machinery, and other arrangements were under discussion between the Railway Companies and the men, but no agreement had been reached at the outbreak of the war. Negotiations were continued for a time after the war began, but broke down finally in 1916, when a new scheme which had been agreed to by the representatives of the men, who had been in negotiation with a Committee of General Managers acting on behalf of the Railway Companies, was rejected by a special delegates&apos; meeting of the National Union of Railwaymen.The Board of Trade had no official knowledge of the reasons for which the scheme was rejected, but it is stated by Messrs. G. D. LI. Cole and R. Page Arnot, in &quot; Trade Unionism on the Railways &quot; (published in 1917 by the Fabian Research Department), that the rejection was largely due to the exclusion from the scheme of Railway shopmen, the retention of Sectional Boards, as distinct from Composite Boards representing all grades, and the exclusion from the scope of the scheme of questions of management and discipline.I therefore propose that, if the Companies and the men cannot agree upon the necessary machinery within a short period after the Bill passes, that a scheme should be settled for them and made binding upon them, and I have included a provision to this effect in the Bill.8. Light Baihuays.There has not been an adequate development of Light Railways proper, using that term in contradistinction to Light Railways which are in fact passenger tramways on public roads.
The main reason for this lack of development is the restrictive provisions of the Light Railways Acts and the attitude of the larger Railway Companies towards the proposals which have come forward.The following figures are illustrative : Years.	Orders Made.	Approximate Mileage Authorised.	Orders in Operation.	Mileage Constructed.1806-1900 19D1-1914	80 89	990 625	1      40	478Of the 40 Orders in operation, a considerable proportion has been obtained by existing Railway Companies, so that out of the wdiole total of lines authorised in past years few have resulted in the construction of railways of the type originally contemplated by the Light Railways Acts.While providing for financial assistance from the State, these Acts impose as a condition precedent that the Light Railway to be assisted is to be constructed or worked by an existing Railway Company.The Acts also provide that if the proposals in an Order, by reason of their magnitude or their effect on an existing Railway Company are such that an Order should not be made, the proposals stand referred to Parliament for procedure by way of Private Bill.In no case has this procedure been adopted, and it is unlikely that the promoters of a Light Railway would be prepared to face a Parliamentary contest with a large Railway Company.In practice, therefore, a Light Railway Order if opposed by an existing Railway Company has little, if any, chance of being passed by the Light Railway Commissioners, and no prospect of any financial assistance from the State unless the promoters are willing to accept such terms as the Railway Company may impose.The large Railway Companies are naturally apprehensive lest a line which commences its existence as a comparatively harmless Light Railway should ultimately develop into a route competitive for some of their traffic or become a link in a shorter through route, and they are apt to object to proposals for Light Railways more upon these grounds than upon any substantial objection to the proposal itself, and even where the Light Railway is constructed have in many cases adopted a policy obstructive to its development.If promoters of Light Railways knew that a proposal would receive considera-tion on its merits and would not be doomed to failure unless they could satisfy an opposing Railway Company, I think development might be possible.I am accordingly proposing that the Light Railway Commission should be absorbed in the Ministry of Transport.In this way all applications for Light Railway Orders will come directly under the consideration of the Minister of Transport at present only those Orders which have passed the Commissioners come before him and there would, when the financial conditions are more favourable, be an opportunity under the powers of the Ministry of Transport Act of financially assisting the development of Light Railways without the condition imposed by the Light Railways Act that no financial assistance can be given unless the line is to be worked by an existing Railway Company.I have confined this Memorandum to my proposals for the future, and I feel satisfied that these proposals will secure the Railway position for the future on a basis which will ultimately be found satisfactory alike to the Traders, the Railway Shareholders and the Public, but serious problems arise with which I will deal further when I meet my colleagues in regard to the transitory period between the 15th August next, when the Guarantee comes to an end, and the 1st January, 1923, which seems to be the earliest date at wmich it will be possible to bring the new system into operation.(Signed)        ERIC C.
