I3,117.16th 2iarch,1921.ILy Lord,I have the honour to forward to Your Lordship  herewith : copies of a Report of the High Commission containing its recommendations in regard to the proposed new Customs Frontier in the Rhineland.   This Report has heen drawn up as    result of the instructions contained in Your Lordship1e telegram to me No.13 of the 7th instant, and is accompanied by a covering letter of        . a copy ie also enclosed.Your Lordehip will not fail to realise the difficulties confronting the High Commission in drawing up a Report of this kind at a momentfs notice.     It would be idle to pretend that the High Commission has had the time to make a profound study of the question or to form even an approximate estimate of the effect of their proposals upon the economic life of the Rhineland or upon foreign trade.   To make a careful exam-ination of details and rates, as desired in the third paragraph of Your Lordship&apos;s telegram No.14 of March 7, would entail a delay of several weeks, if not months, which would have a most unfortunate effect from every point of view.   The new frontier has been arbitrarily drawn through the middle of a thickly populated industrial area, and considerable experience will be required before a tariff can be finally settled which will take full account of all the interests involved. At the present moment we have practically no data upon whioh to worl^ as I attach very little importance to the statisticscollected/Right honourable the Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G,, &amp;c,,     (Sec,,     fee,,
collected during the Armistice period which was wholly abnormal.The best that ire oould do in the circumstances was to suggest that aa regards tho import trade from Unoocupied Into Cocipiec? Territory, the German Customs Tariff should be temporarily adopted, 25^ being levied at onoe, subsequently 50$ and ultimately the full tariff.   The High Commission further suggests that they bo given power to alter &quot;this tariff in the light of experience.   It is impossible to tear off a limb from the body and to expect that limb to live as before.   The whole life of the Oocupied Territory is Intimately bound up with that Unoocupied Germany and I oannct oonoeive that any tariff that can be devised will do aught but gravely injure the economic life of the Khineland,I note from Your Lordships telegram lTo,14 that HiB Majesty1s Government regard this sanction as a temporary penalty which they hope will euffioe to bring Germany to book. I feel it my duty to warn Your Lordship that there is no sign of weakening in the German attitude and that t*re Allies must be prepared for a fight to the finish in the vital issues that has been raised.Your Lordship will not take it amiss if I point out, in fairness to myself and my staff, that a most difficult and delicate task has been entrusted to me and that I am still without guidance as to the policy of His Majestyfs Government or the line that they wish me to adopt.   The Frenoh High Commissioner and the French Government have a definite purpose in view,     I think that there can be little doubt of that. Their intention is to separate the Rhineland, at any rate economically, from the rest of Germany and it is for His Majesty1s Government to decide and to instruct me whether they wish me to further French ends, pursue a policy of indifferonce or one of obstruction,
I imagine that the Allies have no hope of obtaining any considerable revenue from the new Customs regime.   If the intention is merely to induce the Germans td sign, it appears to me that the only effective action that we can take here is to put high duties on rawmateriale and semi-finished goods corning from Unoccupied Territory and to reduce to a minimum all duties on tho V/estern frontier with a view to enabling the Rhineland to obtain from the Wost as much as may be possible of what it required for its industries.   A policy of this kind might oonceivably frighten the Germans and force the hands of the German industrials whose voice is now the loudest in urging the German Government to resist the Allied demands,   With the information at present at my disposal I am unable to judge how far the Allies would be able to provide the Rhineland with the necessaries that it now obtains from Unoccupied Germany,In conclusion I would warn Your Lordship that so far as my local information extends, the issue which has now been raised between the Allied Governments and the German Government will lead to a prolonged struggle,   German industrials in this area are already proclaiming that they will shut down their factories with the deliberate intention of creating unem-ployment in order that their workmen may bring pressure to bear on the workmen of Allied countries.    As lock-outs on. $ large scale and resultant unemployment would gravely affect the safety of the Armies, I am proposing to the High Commission that they should take action with a view to dealing drastcally with any employers who adopt such tactics.   It would, however be/
\&quot;be well that the Allied Authorities should consider whether German factories could be taken over and managed temporarily by Allied experts.From tho above Your Lordship will realise that a variety of grave issues ate at stake and I venture most earnestly to beg that I may be permitted to come to London and to receive direct instructions from Hie l.ajesty&apos;8 Government for my personal guidance &quot;both in dealing with the French and with the Germans,In the meanwhile it is of urgent importance that tho Customs Officials and the reinforcements for which I have pressed in my telegram Ho8,24-28 should be sent to me without delay.   More than 100 French Customs Officials have already arrived and it will be diffioult for me much longer to resist the request of my French colleague that some of these officials should be allowed to operate in the British area,I have the honour to be, with the highest respect,My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient humble Servant, (S signed)     ARNOLD ROBERTSON.

Mo, S954/HCITR.Inter-Allied RhinelandHigh Commission. C0BL.JN2,Maroh 16th 1921.Tho President of the.Inter^Alliod Ehinoland High CommiosiontoThe Right Honourable David Lloyd George, President of the Conference of the Allied Governments, L 0 I D 0 I.In pursuance of telegrams Nos, 13 and 22, which you addressed to me on March 7*ch and 9th 1921, inviting the High Commission to present to the Allied Governments a report regarding a on stems system to be set up in tho Coupled Territories, I havo the honour to submit herewith a Memorandum which has been unanimously approved by the High Commissioners and unofficially communicated to Major-General Allen, Commanding General; American Forces in Germany.   This Memorandum has also received the approval in principle of Odr. de Labadessa (representing the Italian Government in the work of the Hi.:;h Commission in regard to eoonomio and financial questions arising out of the decisions taken in the London Conference).The report presents in the first place, and for information, a general scheme of the present Customs Organisation and the measures taken by the High Commission within the limits of its competence and of the instructions given to it.In the second place it contains an expose of the measures which the High Commission was instructed to submit for the approval of the Allied Governments in conformity with the above mentioned telegrams.The Inter-Allied High Commission feels that it should draw the attention of the Allied Governments to the fact that the mind of the Rhineland population and the economic life of the occupied Territories are troubled by the present state of uncertainty regarding the systems to bo instituted.   It therefore requests the Allied. Governments to be good enough to inform it as soon as possible of their decision regarding the proposals contained in this report so that it may be placed in a position to put into force without delay the system to be applied.The President of the Inter^Allied &apos;     TOCnelanTliiH U omission.&apos; &apos; &apos; v(Signed) R.

In its telegrams No .13 of March 7th 1921, and No.22 of March 9th 1921, the Conference of the Allied Govern-ments, sitting in London, directed the High Commission to present a Report regarding the application of the Sanction imposed by the Conference on Germany by setting up a Cus-tons Frontier along the Rhine and at the limits of the Bridgeheads occupied by the Allied troops0It was laid down that this Report should in particular contain the proposals of the High Commission with regard to the Customs Tariffs to ho applied in respect of goods, either entering or leaving the Occupied Territories across the frontier with Non-Occupied Germany.The present report has therefore been drawn up with the object of presenting the conclusions reached by the High Commission as a result of its investigations.   The first part of tho Report treats of the organisation of the new Customs line and the measures which the High Commission has taken or proposes to take in this connection;   the second Part contains the suggestions of the High Commission with regard to the Customs Tariffs to be levied,,1ST   PART, ORGANISATION OF THE NEJ7 CUSTOMS LINE. 1 v   General Prlnclples o f Organ! sa t/3,qn:It will no doubt be of advantage to recall, in outline the general principles on which customs services are normally organised;   that is to say:-(a) mobile services,(b) stationary services.,(a)   The task of the former is to supervise the frontier to direct persons in possession of dutiable goods to the customs receiving offices, and to suppress attempts atfraud;/
*-2 -fraud;   the staff is organised      serai-military linos;   it may be armed in case of conflict with smugglers.   As a rule, a double line of defence is -set up, with advanco posts of less strength on the extreme frontier, posts of greater strength 20 kilometres to the rear, and an intermediate zone which is patrolled.   The staff of these mobile services is military rather than technical in character, (b)   The stationary services comprise:   at the base, examining and duty-collecting offices near the frontiers (sometimes merged in the Control Posts), District Offices responsible for the control and direction of the service in a given irontier sector, and finally a Central Office responsible for the direction of the entire Customs Service of a country or a province.An inspection department is as a rule set up in addition to the above offices for the purpose of supervising the work of the department*Finally, customs offices are established in the interior in the principal places to which goods are dispatched direct and cleared upon arrival.The staff of the stationary services is purely technical in character,II,    THg GERMAN .CU3T0I1S ORGANISATION is based on these principles.   It comprises (in particular in Rhenish Prussia) offices graded on the following system:a) &apos;Landesfinanzamt (Provincial Head Office) of which the 2nd Section is concerned with the work of centralising the receipts from the customs, the first section being responsible for indirect duties.b) Hauptzollamt (Local Offices),c) Zollinspektion (Inspectors1 Offices),
d)   Zollamt No.l and Ho,2 (Examining and Duty Collec-ting Offices)o   No,l Offices are concerned with the collection both of customs duties and of indirect taxation,, o)   Aufsichtsposten (Guard Posts),The technical officials of the German stationary services bear the following titles:Zollrat, Zollinspektor, Ob er zol 1 s ekr e tar 0ZollsekretaV,Zo 1 lb e tr i eb s s ekr e tar.111 *    THE PROPOSED FRONTIER.The frontier to be established was defined at the London Conference as that which now forms the boundary of the Occupied Territories., Iced the Rhine and the limits of the bridge-heads.   This frontier has a total length of 570 Km0   It comprises from the point of view of customs:!)   A river frontierc   The Rhine for the length of 265 Km. in the following several sectors:a) From the Dutch frontier to the Cologne bridge-head (130 Km,), which Is not affected by the recent occupation of the Ruhrort-Duisburg and Dusseldorf area, the limits of which have not yet been decided. upon0b) From the Cologne bridge-head to the Coblenz bridge-head (25 Km0)0c) From the Mainz bridge-head to the Alsatian frontier (110 KrruK^)   A land frontier In 5 seotovs:(a) Ruhr or t-Dui sburg-Dliss el dor f bridge-head,(b) Cologne bridge-head (120 Km,)(c) Coblenz and Mainz bridge-heads considered as a joint area by suppressing the enclave which separates them (180 Km,),
international river, it may be used by steamers, barges and tugs coming from abroad.     It is therefore necessary to keep under observation, even within the Bridgeheads, the ports of call of such vessels.The organisation of a frontier of this kind presents difficulties, owing to the fact that the boundaries of the bridgeheads, which are drawn along an arbitrary line, do not coincide with the natural boundaries, either administrative or economic.Moreover they extend over a great distance. It would perhaps be possible to find a frontier which would be shorter, more logical and more easily organised. Two suggestions have been put forward, which it would doubtless be well to keep in mind should the organisation of a frontier as contemplated by the Conference of London prove impracticablena).   The Rhine might be adopted as a customs frontier, the bridgeheads being regarded as free zones-     In point of fact, the Rhine constitutes neither an administrative nor an economic frontier-.     The fact that heavy loads must of necessity concentrate upon the regular crossings (ferries and bridges) makes it seem at first sight easy to supervise traffic, but closer reflection shows that smuggling across the river by means of ferries and row-boats is a comparatively simple enterprise and one which would call for a vigilant watch being kept,The extent of this frontier would be, slightly less than that of the frontier contemplated at London (500 kilometres instead of 570).     On the other hand,.   the/
the river frontier would have the disadvantage of favouring the creation in the &quot;bridgeheads, which are under military occupation, of closer eoonomio ties with non-Occupied Germany than with the countries on the Left Bank of the Rhine. There would be the risk of diminishing the receipts from the customs frontier, since the Rhineland customs would be deprived of the dues on goods entering the bridge-heads;   it should be borne in mind that these bridge-heads, which are densely populated and are rich in industries, are in need of considerable supplies.     The customs receipts would, on the other hand, benefit by the exports from the bridge-heads to the Left Bank of the Rhine.b).   The most Logical frontier would follow the lines of the Eastern frontier of Rhenish Prussia and Hesse, which form a tangent to the circles defining the neutral zones. This frontier is in actual fact administrative and in part economic.     It measures about 520 Em.   in length.     Should this line be adopted, the military principle would be maintained of one extensive bridge-head on the Right Bank of the Rhine and a certain economic unity of the Occupied areas would be ensured. But although only a small portion of the Ruhr Basin would thus be incorporated it would involve an extension of the Occupation which it does not fall to us to consider. IV - TBS QUESTION OF PERSOMEL.In dealing with the problem which we have to face the main difficulty consists in the method of finding immediately the necessary customs staff.As/
As a preliminary stage of organisation, the mobile services might consist of personnel taken from the Armies of Occupation.     These latter were formerly in possession of a complete system of traffic control posts. It would he possible to re-establish these posts, to increase their strength when neoessary, and to use them for the mobile customs frontier service.     Customs officials taken from among the existing Allied personnel could be assigned to certain posts as technical experts.In so far as concerns traffic on the Rhine the active watch kept on the river might be supplemented by the use of river police.It still remains to find the technical staff for the stationary services on the new frontier.This staff cannot be improvised.     Its members must be conversant with the German language and legislation. An immediate and satisfactory organisation can only be provided by means of drawing on the staff at present in the German customs services on the Yiestern frontier of the Occupied Territories.     Therefore in the first place the total strength of these services must be ascertained.It might be advisable at a later stage to recruit an.auxiliary German staff to take the place of the military pests and reinforce the technical corps.v* - STAFP 0? THE CUSTOMS SERVICES ,011 JPKE EXISTING FJMTIER THE OCCUPIED TERRlfSHTfS-   &quot;The investigations which have been made into thecustoms organisations at present existing in the occupied territories and into the number and status of the officialsemployed by them, give, for the several Landssfinanzamter,the following returns:-
n    7   MLandeafinanzamterStationary Personnel of the Personnel .      Mobile Services .COLOGNE DUSSELDORF CASSSL DARMSTADT WCRSBUBG924254144454532399 .109 Hot yet ascertained .ii     it207 .TOTALISO 51138plus the personnel of Case el and Darns t adit totalling about 1400.
The question of organisation calls for the following-remarks:-Ic - The services are centralised in five Landesfinanz&amp;nter, two in Occupied Rhenish Prussia, DfirsSEI-DORF and COLOGNE, and three outside the Occupied Territories, CASSEL, WRZBURG and DARMSTADT.     In order that the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission might exercise ths authority of control with which it has been entrusted, it would be necessary to centralise the customs services of the new frontier in one of the towns of the Occupied Territories, Ooblenz for preference.2* - The maritime customs frontier, constituted by the Rhine, is already in being,     All that is necessary, therefore, is to maintain it.     The customs inspection, however, of ships entering Germany, at present takes place at Emmerich, a hon-occupied port of the Right Bank.     It would be necessary to move this place of inspection to the first point at which the Allies hold both banks of the river, that is to say, HOMBilRG HUHRORT.     This point appears particularly adapted for the purpose, since there does not exist on the lower part of the river on the Left Bank any port of importance where vessels coming from abroad can put in and discharge their cargo.At a later date the establishment of an examining post at Mainz for ships entering, passing through and leaving the Occupied Territories will have to come under consideration.&apos; ^      1      &apos;  , &apos; ...&quot; &apos; &apos;.   ......     :3. - The elongated and narrow shape of the Occupied Teriitories which is, above all, accentuated in the noirfch of she Belgian Zone, has the advantage that certain Hauptzollamter ^  and zoliamter are situated at about equal distances from theold and from the new frontier. Theycould therefore, be utilised for the organisation of the latter.
t4c     The Control Service of Imports and Exports (Reichskontrollstelle fur die Ueberwachung der Ein-und Ausf tibr) , which has heon organised on a very extensive scale, and which reduplicates in a certain sense the customs service, could furnish a few officials for the customs personnel of the proposed frontier.     It would he necessary to reouisition the personnel of this control service together with the customs personnel itself.VI.   &apos;      ORGANISATION OF THE NEW CUSTOMS LINE,The particulars set out above make it possible to draw up as follows a scheme for the immediate carrying into effect of the new customs line.1.   The establishment of a Chief Rhinsland Customs Office at Oobleng, under the authority of a German official to be nominated, who will be entrusted with the duty of organising the new frontier and administering the whole of the customs services in the Occupied Territories in accordance with the instructions of the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission,     This official, who will be entitled &quot;Zollkommissar fur das Rheinland&quot; will be responsible to the High Commission for the working of the services and will be under the control of a Managing Board appointed by the High Commission.2,   Supersession of the three Landesfinanz Sinter  -of CASSEL, DARMSTADT and TO2BURG, which are in non-occupied Germany, by the three HauptKOll&amp;nter of WIESBADEN, MAINZ and LUDSTIGrSHAFSN-     There would therefore be in the new organisation two Landesfinanz-amter and three Hauptzollamter acting as Landesfinanz&amp;mter, with competence extending respectively over the following areas:-

The number of these Hauptzollamter is sufficient to supervise the services of the new line.     It will, however, be necessary to convert the Zollamt of GELDERN into a Hauptzollamt, and to extend its competence to the organizations which at present come under the Hauptzollamt of WESEL situated in Non-occupied Territory.     In conclusion, the HauptzollUrater assigned to the new frontier will be the following:Zone of Landes-Occupation.   finanzamtSeat of Haupt-zollamter.OBSERVATIONS.BELGIANDUSSELDORFCLEVES GELDERN DUISBURG CHEF ELD NEUSSDUSSELDORF I DUSSELDORF 2 COLOGNE Bonn Tor t) COLOGNE Rheinau 2) COLOGNE MUlheim 3) COLOGNE Apostel- ) xloster   4)SOLINGENBRITISHCOLOGNE DUSSELDORFAMERICANCOLOGNENEUWIED COBLENZFRENCHWIESBADEN MAINZLUDWIGSHAFENLAHNSTEIN (BINGEN (MAINZ (WORMSLUDWIGSHAFEN LANDAU

It is adequate for the efficient conduct of the service on the &quot;Rhine maritimefrontierOn the land frontiers of the new line the present Customs Receiving Offices are insufficient in number.   The following table shows the new offices (Zollamter) to be created, the technical personnel whioh it would be necessary to assign to them, and the Hauptzollamter to which they should be attached:

These figures are, of course, not to be considered as final any more than the allocation of the new Offices to be established.  Modifications may be made at the moment when the scheme is put into effect, if the Managing Board consider it advisable .
However that may he, it would appear that the necessary staff could be found by means of transfers from the Western frontier.The present staff of the Customs Service in the Occupied Territories amounts to a total of 1385 technical officials and about 1400 assistant employes.   The staff for the Control of Experts and Imports numbers 138,   It will be necessary to transfer about 8;S of the latter which can be dene without interfering with the working vf the service,The staffs which remain will have to make special efforts for a short period to secure the working cf the service during the organisation of the new frontier.Choice of officials to be detached will be left to the discretion pf the Zollkommis3ar with the approval cf the Managing Board,Immediate arrangements will be made to engage  , auxiliary employes with a view, on the one hand, to filling the places sf the officials detached for the work of organisation of the new frontier, and on the other hand, to strengthening the numbers of the latter.5* German Inspectors&apos; Offices of the present customs services will be retained and the functions of each of them extended to embrace a sector of the new frontier,6.    Organisation of the technical control of the Inter^Alliod Rhineland High Commission,In order that the Inter-Allied Rhinsland High Commission may exercise control over these services in all their grades, the following provisions have been made:(a)   A Rhineland Customs Managing Board at Coblenz appointed by the High Commission and entrusted with the administration cf Customs.   This Board which has already begun work will give all the nec^saary instructions to the Zollkommissar ,
- 14 -(b) The appointment to each Landesfinanzaint of an Allied Customs Official acting as Inspector to supervise the working of the services and, in particular, the disposal of the duties collected.(c) The appointment of Allied Controllers (Con-trollers or Examiners) to the Hauptzollamter of thenew line with powers to supervise all the details of the service within the sphere of action of the Hauptzoll-amter.The organisation of this service would entail the co-operation of the following Allied officials .Inspectors or ControllersOfficials or Examiners , aoting as suohBelgian Zone ... 1 7British   &quot;... 1 5French    &quot;     ,,. 4 7American &quot;... 2TOTAL... 6 21(d)   The supervision by the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission of the customs services of the Western frontier will he carried out either by subordinate officials under the High Commission or Inspectors who are now acting on the same frontier in the Allied countries.   These Inspectors will be accredited for this purpose by the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission to tho Hauptzollamter concerned.
The customs-poets situated on the Dutch frontier and those on the Baar and Luzemburg frontiers will he inspected he detached Allied personhel which will he transferred for the purpose.   It will he neceBaary to inoroaae by a few persons the number provided for in    paragraph (c) above. m Orgar-JBatJcn of the nobilU services.The mobile service for the purpose of watching the frontiers, which requires, a considerable number of men (on an average two men to each kilometre) might well be provided, to begin with at least, by the Armies of Occupation, These Armies had during the period of Armistice all along the frontier to be controlled, a complete system of traffic control posts which it would be advisable to re-establish, entrusting them with the work of watching the customs frontier.   The organisation ought to be completed by the formation of a chain of principal postB at a diatanoe of about 20 kilometres behind the land frontiers of the hridgeheade.   The principal posts would mark the boundaries of the zone which the guards would patrol for smugglers. The details of this organisation which ie of a military character will be left to the Armies,Subordinate officials from the Allied Customs Service who would aot as guides and instructors to the men of the posts, will be added at certain military posts.Finally, the mobile service might be reinforced by a Rhine river police, the organisation of which should be left to the   G,R,A, andwhich should carry on its work, as regards the customs service, in conjunction with the Inspectors and Controllers representing the Inter-Allied rhineland High Commission at the Hauptzollftmter,
Such is the proposed organisation, which is capable of being put into operation at the shortest notice.   It cannot be anything but a first step, and would obviously admit of improve-ment later if the new customs frontier were held for long, by means of the recruiting and instruction of reinforcements which would make it possible to tighten the chain of Customs Receiving Offices and by degrees to replace the staff drawn from the Armies by a suitable German staff.The short period of time within which it has been necessary to make this report, has not rendered it possible to set forth in detail the two alternative schemes of organisation considered at the beginning as possible customs frontiers, (The Rhine on the one hand, the boundaries of Rhenish Prussia and of Hesse on the other hand.)   The instructions sent from London moreover leave no doubt as to the choice of the customs frontier to be established, namely that of which we have just considered the organisation,8. - Conclusion: Measures which the High Commission has taken or intends to take.In conclusion it is necessary:1,   To create at Coblenz a Rhineland Customs Managing Board appointed under tho authority of the Inter-Allied rhineland High Commission to administer the Customs,   This step was taken by the High Commission on March 12th,2,   To choose a  ollkommissar ftir das Rheinland&quot; in charge of the whole of the customs services of tho Occupied Territories, This officiaL will be responsible to the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission for the working of the services and will receive his instructions from the Managing Board,3,   To convert the three Haupzollamter of Wiesbaden, Mainz and Ludwigshafen&quot;into Landesfinanzamter in substitution for the Landesfinantf&amp;mter of Cassel, Darmstadt and Wtirzburg, in the ITon-O^cupied Territories,   This measure would appear to have boon
boon already taken by tho German authorities,4, To make use for the now customs frontier of tho ninctoon Hauptzollamter bordering on this frontier and enumerated in tho present report,   Tho Zollamt of Geldren will be converted into a Hauptzollimt,5, To transfer to the now customs lino the thirty-one Zollamter existing near this line and enumerated in tho prosont report. Twenty-one now Customs RocGiving Offices (Zollamter) will be created in accordance with the table givon in tho present report,6,   To maintain tho present customs organisation on tho &quot;maritime frontiers&quot;. Provision must be mado, however on tho Rhine at Ruhrort-Homberg and at Lainz for two customs inspootion posts to examine vessels coming from abroad or pasving through tho Occupied Territories,7, To transfer   from the existing German Staff of the station-ary service about seventy officials and eighty assistant employees to the above mentioned Zollamter0   This transfer could be affected without impeding the wor3-influencing ofr the department; the total strength in the Occupied Territories of the Staff of all grades belonging to the stationary service i s at the moment about 1,900 persons.

2ND F A R T tTHE CUSTOMS TAKIFF TO BE APPLIED PIT THE TO FRONTIER.It is important to decide as regards the exchange of goods in both directions between the Occupied Territories and the remainder of Germany, both on tho one handi, the f orm in whioh the duties are to be leviedr and on the other hand the rate of these duties,1* &quot; Duties to be paid upon entering the i\hineland.a)    Form of thetariff^   The organisation which we are obliged to create in a very short period of time compels us to make use of a reduced German technical staff in whom we can place only limited confidence, and an improvised auxiliary staff whose task must be simplified.Me are therefore forced to prepare a tariff which on the one hand resembles as nearly as possible that which the staff&apos; is accustomed to apply and which on the other hand only calls for the application of simple methods.This compels us first of all to eliminate the &quot;ad valorem1&apos;&quot; type of tariff which requires very capable and reliable officials and would constitute an innovation for German officials, accustomed to specific tariffs.
An &quot;ad valorem&quot; tariff can therefore he applied only in the case of certain products of great valuo and of a special kind; such as: jewels, ohjets     d!art, scientific instruments, which it is impossible to tax otherwise.For the rest, the most simple and logical solution would therefore he to collect the import customs duties in accordance with the German tariff.h) Hate of the duties.     is it necessary to apply this tariff in its entirety?   It seems that it would he expedient to discriminate at this Juncture between the different products imported from IT on-occupied Germany into the Khineland, with regard to the degree of necessity of these imports and their amount0It has not been possible for any official German statistics to be published on this subject, as the Occupied Territories form part of several different States, and their statistics are included in those published by these States.We are however, in possession of statistics drawn up during the last six months of the period of the Armistice,when the blockade
of Germany had already been raised and traffic betweea. the Occupied Territories and the rest of Germany was subjected to supervision by the Inter-Allied iMneland Commissien.   According to the results given by the investigations made into this matter trade between the Occupied Territories and the rest of Germany was three times as great as between the Oocupied Territories and other countries.    Further, during that period the Occupied Territories had in comparison with Non-occupied Germany an excess Of imports over exports in the following articles:-Live animals; potatoes; farinaceous products; malt, etc-tobacoo; plants and fodder; slag; wools; horse-hair; hair and feathers; fireclay; ircn-ore; lead; tin; zinc; ooal and coke; marble and ornamental stones; cement and lime; tar and tar derivatives; tannins; glass and crystal glass; paper; hides and skins; wooden articles; special steels; hardware; ironmongery goods; rolling stock; agricultural machinery; materials for bridges and roads; materials for mines,Without attaching undue importance to the exceptional conditions ruling during the Armistice period, it may be assumed that the iMneland, which generally speaking is in every sense an exporter of manufactured goods, is an importer, in so far as concerns Non-occupied Germany, mainly of foodstuffs of prime necessity, of raw materials and of half-finished products.The German tariff is fairly moderate for these commodities or products and it would appear that its application need not a priori cause a stoppage of the import into the iMneland of material which is indispensable for its economic life.Moreover, in order not to administer too sudden a blow to traffic between the IMneland and the rest of Germany this tariff could be put into full effect gradually.    For example, it could be applied at the start with a co-efficient of reduction of 75$ to he followed very shortly by a reduction of 50$, and finally with no reduction.
IL9,-JM-VQ.?erepropose, in conclusion, to apply at first-to importsr from non-occupied Germany into the iMneland the G-erman customs tariff (collected on a gold basis as on the other, frontiers)., but with a co-efficient. cf reduction of 75$ applicable to all commodities^The Inter-Allied Hhineland High Gomnisr-ion should be left to judge of the expediency of reducing at such time as it may consider it possible this co-efficient of reduction and of modifying1 the tariff for certain articles if economic necessities demand such procedure.2c   DUTIES TO Be PAID ON GOODS IMH.1 FOR WHWoThe German Customs Services collect expert taxes which vary according to the nature of the products exported (as a rule 2 to 8$ of the value of the product)9    Lists of these taxes are published with constant modificationsThese taxes, which it may bo mentioned have given rise to strong protest on the; part of German industry, produced in fact for the whole territory of the Reich 1875 million paper marks in the period between April 1st IdZO and February 1st 1921, whilst the import duties for the sajne period only produced 1675 million0The institution of duties on goods leaving the Occupied Territories for the other parts of Germany would give us the means of guiding to a certain extent the exports of these territories.    Higher duties than those in force on the external frontiers would result in the favouring of exports to the West. Such a possibility cannot be considered desirable having regard to the period of industrial crisis through which all the Allied countries are passing.In order that the Rhineland may continue its exports to the rest of Germany it is necessary not to create, by establishing too high duties on goods leaving the country, the barrier which we fear and behind which the Hhineland would inn the risk t*f being stifled.
The Oonferenoe of London moreover has laid down in its last instructions that lev/ duties, which may he considered as statistical dues, shall he imposed upon goods leaving the -zone-land Territories for Non-occupied Germany.But, in order to simplify the collection of those duties, it would he convenient to determine them according to the German tariff for import duties with the aid of a co-efficient of re-duction.   V/e propose to collect for goods exported to Non-occupied Germany, duties according to the customs tariff above mentioned, but levied in paper marks, i.e., without subjecting them to the co-efficient of increase fixed by the&apos; German Govern-ment in order to meet the depreciation of tho mark.   This pro-cedure would be equivalent, with the present rate of exchange, to the collection of 10$ of the specific duties actually levied on imports.    If for example, these latter were 10$ of tho value of the products, 1$ of this same value would he collected as export duty.This solution would have the advantage of rendering it possible to raise without any difficulty, if circumstances should allow of it, the duties on goods leaving for Non-occupied Germany by means of a simple modification of the co-efficient of reduction.Upon products which are not subject to export duty when leaving Germany a statistical duty would be collected as follows One paper mark per package, ton, cubic metre for goods in bulk and one paper mark per head for animals.In view, however, of the particular importance of the manu-facture of dye-stuffs and chemical pharmaceutical products in the Occupied Territories, the High Commission would suggest, with a view to being immediately in a position to collect appreciable revenues, that the export duties at present collected upon the external frontiers of Germany should also be levied in their entirety upon exports crossing the new frontier line of the Oooupied Territories.
- 24 - * 19The High Commission is at present considering the institution of the transit regulations which it intends to impose;   it will pay cue regard to the economic interests at stake ano enforce these regulations as soon as the new customs line upon the Rhine has becun its duties.The High Commission at the same time will examine to what extent the provisions of Article 269 of the Treaty of Peace, may be affected by the new system,COKCiiUSIQN.In sum, the High Commission would propose for the approval of the Allied Governments:1. For fioocis entering the Rhinelanti from Non-occupied Germany the German tariff levied.on a gold basis hut ap-plied in three rapid successive stages, recourse being had to the following co-efficients of reductions:-lst Btage - Co-efficient of reduction of 75% 2nd btage - Co-efficient of reduction of 50)?: 3rd btage - Pull tariff.2- T^or  ooog leaving the Khinelanc. Territories for ftiocciuied Germany, duties will be imposed an^lo^ous to statistical duties in the simple form of the duties laid down in the German customs tariff but collected in paper marks.  This would amount,at the present official rate of exchange, to the collection of 10;1 of the German gold tariff.For goods not subject to taxation when leaving Germany, a statistical duty will be levied&quot;as follows: one paper mark per package,ton,cubic metre, or per head, for ani als.In the case of dyestuffs and chemical pharmaceutical products the export taxes at present collected upon the exterior frontiers of Germany will be imposed.
-25 b-In conclusion, the high Commission remarks that in making tho above proposals it has been careful not to ^o beyond the instructions contained in the telegrams which have been addressed to it by the Conference of the Allied Governments and to furnish a report in as short a period as possible.    In consequence, it has been compelled to limit its proposals to those of a general character and has not had sufficient time to adapt article by article the German tariff which contains more than a thousand distinctions,    Nor has the High Commission been able to estimate the effect which the complete application of this tariff at the new frontier line will produce upon the economic life of the Occupied Territories.The High Commission further remarks that the existing German tariff is a protective tariff designed to foster certain classes of industries which extend throughout Germany, in the face of foreign competition.  There can be no doubt that it will be necessary to introduce modifications into this tariff in order to adapt it to the special situation of the Khineland.    The investiga-tions which have already been set on foot by the High Commission will enable it to ascertain in what manner such modification should be made.Further, the fact that a new ee&amp;sme customs barrier to the east of the Occupied Territories has been set up will obviously demand that the opportunity be given the Rhineland to receive from countries situated to its west certain foodstuffs, raw materials, and even manufactured goods by lowering in specific cases the import tariff at present in^orce on the external frontiers of Germany. -   . The High Commission therefore requests that it be authorised to modify at such time as the circumstances
appear to it favourable the tariffs on the customs frontiers, whether Eastern or Western, of the Occupied Territories, a course which will enable it, without violent change, to increase the receipts from those frontiers while at the sane time taking due heed of the economic necessities of the Rhineland,The President of the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission..
