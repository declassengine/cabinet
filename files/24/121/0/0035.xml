/HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT), i.....----................................jRET. C A B I NET, /js&apos; SURVEY OF&apos; THE STATE OF IRELAIID^FORJ-EJJC ENDEDKJLliJ,MiRCIIt TGJSl, (Circulated by the Chief Secretary for Ireland)BI submit for the consideration of the Cabinet my survey for the week ended the 14th instant,GENERAL STATE OF TH&apos;-.. COUNTRY * Statistics of Outragesa.The Outrage Return for the week shows a considerably reduced total compared with that of the previous week, but the reduction is in the main due to a decrease in the number&apos;of raids upon mailsc,     The fluctuations in the figures for this particular form of rebel activity appear to stand in no determinable relation to the variations In the figures for the more serious kinds of crime,   and are therefore not of much importance as an index of change in the general state of the country.     The number &quot;of attacks upon the Crown Forces (31) was approximately the same as in the previous week (54). but the casualties in these attacks fell from 34 to 25cOnly one encounter on a considerable scale between Crown and rebel forces occurred:during the week.     This was an ambush of a party of Military which took place near MchillP Co0 Leitrim,.-. on the 11th instant, and resulted disastrously for the rebels who -lost six of their number kille&amp;p and one taken prisoner,.   The Military suffered no casualties and their success was completed-by the capture of a large quantity of arms and ammunition,. , Another incident of importance was an attack on a train containing.a party of Auxiliary Police passengers at Tuberid Railway Station, -Tralee
Pistrlot on the 12th instant.     One of the Auxiliaries v/os shot dead and the driver and fireman of the train were wounded.Six unsuccessful attacks on occupied Police Barracks were made during the week, but no casualties were suffered or material damage inflicted on the barraclrs in any case.The total Police casualties for the week were 7 killed and 10 :rounded.     Military casualties were 8 wounded.     3 of the murdered policemen were killed in ambushes and 4 were cases of ordinary assassinations, 3 of the latter occurring in Belfast and 1 in Kilmallock, Co. Limerick.In addition to these Crown casualties the roll of Sinn Fein murders for the week includes at least 7 murders of civilians suspected of having given information to the Police or Military Authorities.    A number of other civilian murders occurred during the week In circumstances which surest that they were committed as reprisals for Sinn Fein murders of policemen and ex-soldier civilians, but the verdicts of the Courts of Inquiry are not yet known.     I do not include in this latter category the sensational murders of the Mayor and Ex-Mayor of Limerick which are at present under investigation by o Military Court of Inquiry which is being held in public. Although both these men were prominent Sinn Feiners they were known to bo opposed to murder and the Officer Commanding at Limerick has testified to their willing co-operation with him in maintaining peace.     In the absence of any assignable motive for the murder by any members of the Crown forces of the District, I see no ground for yielding to the demands that have been made in certain quarters for the appointment of a
Oivil Court to inquire into the circumstances of the crime. It is unfortunate that the relatives refuse to come forward to give evidence before the Military Court.Minor outrages for the weok included 27 raids on mails and 4 raids for a mo.Arrests for outrages and political offences numbered 71 for the wee .TRIALS OF CIVILIANS BY COURT MARTIAL.Eighty-four trials of civilians by Court kartial were concluded during the week and resulted in sixty-one convictions and twenty-one acquittals.    The following is an analysis of the sentences imposed in the oases of con-viotionj22 Sentences of Penal Servitude (3 years to 15 years) 23ititof Imprisonment withHard Labour (7 days to 2 years)of Imprisonment with-out Hard Labour       (Z months to 1 year)TOTAL7 iPines 57(10/- to  25)In two of the remaining cases the accused was bound over to keep the peace and in the other throe the sentences were remitted by the Confirming Officer.Ten of the trials were in respect of ordinary crime, and included the cases of two constables of the Royal Irish Constabulary who were convicted of looting and sentenced to three years penal servitude.     The remaining seventy-four trials were for offences arising out of the present state of the country.Internment Orders.138 Orders for internment were made during the week,

LL? lOLITIO&amp;L OllillOli, Iff IRELAND._The execution of six uinx: Ire in prisoners in Dublin on Monday v*as attended by j remarkable demonstration outside Mount joy Prison,   large but orderly crowds assembled in the neighbourhood of the Prison and engaged in prayer while the executions were proceeding and all trafxic and business was suspended for three hours afterwards.   Two of the condemned men c-eie convicted of complicity in the murders of British Officers on the 21st November, last, and although the evidence produced at their trial was Quite conolusive oi their guilt, and was not shaken b;, anj evidence subsequently brought forward, the suggestion of their innocence was deliberately worked up da^ bt, day in the anti-Government Press,The
The other four men v.ere convicted of High i.rea On on the charge of levying war against the Crown by taking part in an ambush on a party of ^miliar^ iolice in Dublin.The decision to enforce the capital penalty in these cases, although no casualties were buffered by the Crown Forces in the particular ambush on account of which the men were convicted was based upen the absolute necessity of employing the strongest measurea available to put down the practice of attacking military and police lorries in the streets of Dublin, which has within the past few weeks forme 1 a regular part of the general plan of the campaign of guerilla warfare waged by the so-called Irish Republican Army,   jince the 1st Januarc of this year, there have been no less than forty-eight attacks of this nature in Dublin alone which have resulted in the deaths of one soldier, three policemen and three innocent civilians, and the wounding of seventeen soldiers, nine police and at least thirty-two civilians.   It is to be hoped that llondayT s executions will operate as an effectual deterrent against these attacks.Every possible precaution has been ta&amp;en against such reprisals by the Irish republican ^rmy as occurred after the recent executions in Cork.*(Intd.) h* GoRISH Oi^ICE, o.W.I., 17th March, 1921.
