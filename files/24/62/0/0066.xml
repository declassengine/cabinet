Tho Commander-in-Chief feels that in view of India&apos;s dependance upon distant countries for animals, and of possible commitments in Asiatic theatres consequent on the great changes occuring in Political and strategical problems, it is neoessary to make adequate provision for the war requirements of India and of her-Field Army.     The Chief of the Imperial General Staff concurs in the above demands.4.     The Commander-in-Chief * s original demand included secondly, a forecast of wastage for the year 1919-1920 at the import rate of 10^ per annum in India, and 12.* in the forces operating in Mesopotamia, giving total of roundly 9,600. No margin is provided for possible increases in the Indian Army establishments in that year.The changed situation in the far East makes it probable that the number of mules to be obtained in China  during the winter of 1019-1920, will be very much less than this year, and the Council therefore considered it desirable to make sure of the supply by imparting at any ::ate the bulk of the mules demanded from the Argentine this winter-     They realise, however, that the War Cabinet may decide that the Shipping situation does not warrant such a course and that the importation of mules for 1919-1920 wastage should rather be deferred till the early Autumn of 1919,It is for decision by the War Cabinet whether shipping is to be provided to India :-(a) for 7,400 mules from China required to make upthe numbers needed in India this year;(b) for 4,600 mules from Argentina required to makeup the numbers needed in India this year.(o)       for 9,200 mules from Argentina to meet theCommander-in-chief&apos;s supplementary demand detailed in paragraph 3 above; and(d)      for 6,000 mules or less from Argentina needed for the supply of the year 1919-1920.MI Mm/&quot;;.......- -v,13th/September, 1918,^    J
