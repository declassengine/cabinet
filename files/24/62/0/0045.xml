Detailed Report.1. The Council.The President of the United States has appointed the Hon. George Rublee to be an additional representative of the United States on the Council.Arrangements have been made for the Third Session of the Council to be held in London on August 2&apos;Jth, .1918, at Lancaster House.2. Italian Coal.The programme of the normal supply of coal to Italy amounting to 600,000 tons a month, which was approved by the Council at its first session on I5th March, was &apos; continued by decision of the Counci] on 23rd April.The figures- for the period July 15th to August 14th are as follows:-	Plan.	Execution.	Tons.	Tons.	150,000	305,337		(approx.).British coal passing Italian frontier.......	100,000 -	92,756	170,000	108,520French coal on board at French Mediterranean ports    -      -      -	180,000	124,252-	600,000	630,965The shortage of coal referred to in page 3 of the previous Report of Action has continued over the period now dealt with, as have also difficulties in the provision of railage across France. Every effort has, however, been made to ship the maximum quantity of coal direct.It may be mentioned that shipments via Blaye amounting to 83,139 tons have been made during this period. These quantities would normally appear as arrivals in the report for the next month.The position regarding the deficit on the programme total for the period since 15th March is as follows : Programme for four months ending 14th July    - 2,400,000 tons.Supplied   -----.....  2,326,322  ,,Deficit     -     -     -     -   j -     -     -     -     - -      73,678  ,,It will be seen that of this deficit approximately -     - -      31,000   ,,   hasbeen made good during the month ending 14th August.      -----It is hoped to clear off the remaining deficit of   -     - -      42,670during the coming month. -Of the strategic reserve of 150,000 tons, a total of 139,720 tons have now been shipped or allocated, leaving the balance of 10,280 tons to be provided for. The figure 139,720 does not include a cargo of 6,714 tons shipped against this requirement and subsequently sunk. It is hoped to ship the remaining 10,280 tons at an early date.3. French Coal.The shipments during July amounted to 1,488,894 tons, against the provisional programme of 1,740,000 tons deficit 251,106 tons. The remarks made on page 4 of the previous Report still hold good, and shipping lias been provided for all the coal that could be supplied from the United Kingdom and received in French ports.4. Belgian Relief.Following upon the arrangements described in the previous Report, the United States and Great Britain have made special allocations of tonnage to meet the requirements of theBelgian Relief. These allocations, together with the non-war-zone Swedish tonnage, to the extent to which it has become available, and the special* Exact figures for 13th and 14th August not being available approximate figures have been given.
shipments of flour, &amp;c. from the United Kingdom to Rotterdam (referred to later), have enabled the Belgian Relief requirements for June, July and August to be approximately met on the basis of the Wheat Executive figures, the total deficiency for the three months amounts only to 19,133 tons or about 6,400 tons a month, against a requirement of 120,000 tons a month. The additional tonnage during these months has been found by the United States and Great Britain in practically equal shares, the actual figures being 57,660 tons by the United States and 59,850 tons by Great Britain.With regard to special shipments from the United Kingdom it will be remembered that to meet urgent needs Great Britain undertook to transport 10,000 tons of flour and some 14,000 tons of beans, peas, rice, herrings, clothing, and miscellaneous articles held by the Belgian Relief in the United Kingdom. The whole of the flour has now been shipped, and the shipments of the other commodities are proceeding, although action has been delayed by a dock strike in Rotterdam.The Belgian Relief Commission have recently made representations regarding their urgent need for rice, and it has been agreed that, in order to meet the emer-gency, a further 5,000 tons of rice (in addition to the 2,000 tons already agreed upon) shall be shipped from this country to Rotterdam in the British vessels put on the service for the carriage of the flour, &amp;c. It has been made clear that this action has been taken solely to meet the urgent necessities of the destitute people in Belgium and Northern Prance, for whom no rice would be available in the United States until October next, and that there can be no further continuance of this method of meeting the Belgian Relief requirements, as it involves extra strain on tonnage and extra risk.5. Pool Tonnage.The number of vessels in the Pool has risen from 124 to 176, and they have been dealt with under the general directions of the Permanent Organisation in accordance with the working plan described on page 7 of the previous report.6. Changes in Allocation of Tonnage as betxoeen the Allies.(a) Under the agreement of 3rd November 1917 and as subsequently modified and supplemented, Great Britain has in practice accepted responsibility for supple-menting deficiencies in tonnage required for transporting to France and Italy their agreed shares in the cereal programme.The quantities of cereals so supplied in British tonnage to France and Italy in the month of July were approximately as follows : France        - 163,000 tonsItaly -----   78,000 tonsTotal     - 241,000 tonsThese quantities are diversions and do not include the quantities of cereals supplied in British ships previously time-chartered to France or Italy.(b) Allocations to Italy.The tonnage loading in August on the British Liner Service from the United States to Italy will amount to 51,295 tons d.w., and 47,800 tons d.w. have already been allocated for September loading. A cargo of sugar has been diverted from Great Britain to Italy.(c) France.The tonnage loading on the British Liner Service from the United States to France in August will amount to 65,870 tons d.w., and in September to 93,500 tons d.w.As regards the request by France for the transport from the United States of 100,000 tons of railway waggons and raw material referred to in the previous report, it is estimated that about 60,000 tons will have been shipped by the end of August.Pending the examination by the Programme Committee of the French request for the shipment of oil seeds, arrangements have been made by which four British requisitioned neutral vessels engaged in the French coal trade are being sent to Dakar with coal for French needs and will thereafter load oil seeds to Marseilles.A2
During the past two months Great Britain has diverted more than 25,000 tons of sugar to France to meet the present shortage. Although no request for assistance in the matter of sugar had previously been made by France and although the diversion of tonnage has necessarily been made at the expense of other commodities, the urgency of the need was such as to necessitate the action taken.(d) During the month of July the total embarkation of American troops was 305,000 and of this number 188,000 were embarked in British vessels.The use of British tonnage for the transport of American troops to France involves the loss of about 40 per cent, of the cargo carrying capacity of the vessels so employed. The average amount of cargo shut out for each man carried is found to be about 2Tlffth tons. During the four months April to July 1918, 518,950 American soldiers have been carried in British vessels, and this has involved the loss of 1,090,000 tons of imports.6. Oilier Tonnage Arrangements.(a) The use of refrigerator space in the North Atlantic. The proposal described on pages 7 and 8 of the previous Report has been further discussed with the United States Authorities, who are in agreement with the suggested principle of exchange, but prefer to postpone the conclusion of an arrangement until there is a surplus of American refrigerator tonnage in the Atlantic, which is not at present the case owing to delay in delivery of tonnage. In the meantime Great Britain is rendering the United States Government such assistance as is required in transporting meat for the American Army to France.(b) Vessels Sailing tohile not Loaded down to tlieir Marks. The attention of the Tonnage Committee was drawn to the fact that certain neutral steamers allocated to the Wheat Commission and loading cereals for France from North America had sailed light of their marks, and that the French Government agents for these vessels, on being requested to take dead-weight cargo, had pointed out that these steamers were loaded solely for the carriage of foodstuffs and grain, and that they had no instructions to ship dead-weight cargoes.The Committee were unanimously of opinion that this loss of carrying-power should be remedied, and the members agreed to call the attention of their respective Govern-ments to the matter.The French Government representative has since reported that - the necessary steps have now been taken by -his Government, and that, in fact, in the cases mentioned, the loading of the most economical proportion of heavy cargo was rendered more difficult by the necessity of getting vessels away to catch convoys.7. Programme Committees.Since the date of the previous Report, Mr. Herbert Hoover, the Food Controller of the United States, has visited Europe, and meetings of the Food Controllers of the associated Governments have taken place in London. An Inter-Allied Food Council has been established, to consist of the four Food Controllers, and an additional representative of each of the four countries, which will meet every three months or as often as may be necessary and within the limits of the powers conferred upon it by the respective Governments will agree upon a programme and methods of food imports embracing the needs of all the Allied countries, and will determine questions of common interest and policy. The Food Controllers further agreed to appoint two representatives each to form a body called the Inter-Allied Food Council Committee of Representatives having its headquarters in London under an independent Chairman. The functions of the Committee of Representatives include the co-ordination of the Programmes of the various Food Executives or Programme Committees and the consolidation of these programmes into a general Food Programme . for all foods and all Allied countries, and the Committee will act as the channel of communication as to general policy between these executives and the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the Inter-Ally Council on War Purchases and Finance.These decisions are welcome from the point of view of the Transport Council, inasmuch as the Council will now deal with one body as regards food instead of with four or more separate bodies each of them concerned with a separate section of the food supply.
Certain correspondence has taken place between the Council and the Inter-Allied Food Council and is printed as Appendix 1. A copy of this correspondence has been sent to the Munitions Council.Representatives of the American War Industries Board are now in Europe for the purpose of discussing questions connected with Programme Committees and the formation of Inter-Allied Bodies with executive powers to deal with a number of commodities; and of arranging the appointment of American representatives on more of the committees.It has been thought convenient to collect the information available up to the present as to the composition of the various Programme Committees, and this will be found in Appendix 2, though it must be understood that the list is provisional and subject to correction.Copies of two Memoranda which have been issued to Programme Committees are printed as Appendices 3 and 4, and these in conjunction with the Memorandum printed on page 19 of the previous Report complete the series up to the present.Speaking generally, the Programme Committees have not yet completed their task of framing programmes for the remainder of .1918, but information which they have collected in the course of their work has proved of use on more than one occasion. The Committees will be asked to extend their work by framing programmes for the ensuing year at an early date. In the meantime, pending the receipt and collation of the programmes, the Council will probably wish to discuss the general principles on which their recommendations as to the allocation of tonnage between the different services shall be based. A Memorandum containing some suggested principles will be circulated separately.
APPENDIX I.Correspondence between Allied Maritime Transport Council and Food Council.(a) Letter from Transport Council to Food Council.&quot;30th July 1918.I am directed by the Allied Maritime Transport Council to forward to you here-with, for the information of the Food Council, the following observations as to the tonnage position in relation to the Food Programmes which are now under consideration.The procedure which will require to lie followed after the programmes have been received, both from the Food Council and also from the Munitions Council and the Programme Committees covering other imported commodities, has been explained,in Memorandum B., dated July 18th, 1918.In view of the immense importance, however, of the Programmes covered by the Food Council to the whole tonnage programme, the Council may find it convenient at this stage and before the detailed examination of the programmes has been made, to have a preliminary note as to certain important factors that require to be taken into account. The Council will realise that it will save considerable delay and inconvenience both to themselves and to the corresponding bodies dealing with other commodities, as well as to the transport Council, if the work of reducing programmes to minimum requirements is carried as far as possible before the first formal submission of the programmes to the Transport Council.I am to state generally with regard to the tonnage position that wdiile it is true that world building has now reached world losses, this fact is due to the large excess of American, building over American losses, and the American excess thus resulting is not available for general European imports in view of the needs of the American army. Taking the building of the rest of the world against the losses of the rest of the world, which for the above reason offers the more reliable index of the tonnage available for the European Allies, I am to point out that there is still each month a serious excess of losses over building, the excess of such losses amounting in the first six months of this year to II- million tons dead weight.Apart from this very general statement of the tonnage position, a simple criterion is afforded as to the value of effecting any given saving in tonnage, as against a loss from other points of view, by the fact that America can send, and the Military Authorities desire, more American Troops in France than the available and prospective tonnage is adequate to transport and pupply. It follows, therefore, that any saving in tonnage directly increases the number of American Troops in France, and it may be stated with approximate accuracy that each 5,000 tons of imports saved means that a further 1,000 American soldiers can be supplied, and therefore sent to France, than would otherwise be possible.If, therefore, the Food Council has at any time under consideration two alternative courses, one of which offers certain advantages from the point of view of finance, or the comfort of the civilian populations, while&quot; the other offers the prospect of saving-tonnage, it will be possible to measure the cost to the Allied cause of taking the first course by reckoning that for each extra 5,000 tons of imports involved in it there must be a reduction in the number of American soldiers in France by 1,000.The Food Council now has the great advantage of knowing precisely what has been the consumption in each country of each important food commodity during the past year. In view of the continued shortage of tonnage, and the special reason indicated above for economising to the utmost possible extent, I am to express the hope that the Council will find it possible to take the record of total actual consumption during this last cereal year as setting the maximum limit to the proposed programme for the ensuing year. This does not, of course, necessarily mean that there would be no increase in any particular commodity, but that if such an increase is necessary it should be used to relieve the requirement for some other commodity as compared with last year&apos;s consumption. The application of this principle would of course mean the continuance of imports on the basis of last year, subject to a reduction or
increase where there has been any improvement or reduction in home production, and with such further adjustments in relation to stocks as are required to keep these above, but not unnecessarily above, the point of danger.Apart from reducing total requirements for food in the different countries to a minimum, the Council will also doubtless have in mind the necessity of arranging programmes in such&apos; a way as to involve the smallest strain upon tonnage, whether by drawing supplies from the nearest source or by obtaining them in such a form as to involve least bulk and weight in relation to food value.It will of course be realised that this letter is only intended to  five a very general indication of the tonnage position and of certain principles which are being suggested to all the various bodies now considering programmes of Allied imports. It is now addressed to you in the hope that the consideration of the food programmes from the commencement in the light of the above suggestions may reduce and facilitate the work of subsequent re-adjustment of programmes between the Transport Council and the Food Council in relation to the total tonnage available and the demands upon it fro qi all other sources.J. A. Salter.The Secretary, . cFood Council.(6) Resolution of Food Council communicated to Transport Council.Resolution.31st July 1918.The letter of the Allied Maritime Transport Council of to-day having been laid before the Food Council, the Council wishes to state that while it agrees with the absolute necessity of minimum use of tonnage, and has in itself been created for this purpose, yet the basis of calculation on imports to England, France, and Italy upon the foundation of last year&apos;s imports, less increase of production, simply means a repetition of the food difficulties of last year. We wish to state emphatically that the morale of the people will be most seriously endangered by such a basis of imports. The Food Council puts forward as a more constructive basis the employment of the same ship ton mileage during the coming year.30th July 1918.(c) Letter from Transport Council to Food Council.5th August.I am directed by the Allied Maritime Transport Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st July conveying a copy of a resolution passed by the Food Council on July 30th with. reference to the Transport Council&apos;s letter of the same date.The Transport Council much regret that the Food Council express dissent from the suggestion that, in the framing of the food programmes for the ensuing year, the total consumption during the past year should be taken as setting the maximum limit, i.e., that the imports should be not greater than what is required in combination with home production, to allow consumption in total on the same scale as during the last year (with such variations as may be desirable as between different commo-dities or countries) and to keep stocks above, though not unnecessarily above, the point of danger.The Transport Council feel bound to repeat their opinion that in view of the tonnage position this is a reasonable principle to adopt in framing the food pro-grammes, and think it may be convenient to the Food Council to state, at this early early stage, that they can offer no prospect whatever of being able to arrange tonnage upon the principle suggested by the Food Council.I am to observe that (1) The application of the principle suggested by the Transport Council would not involve the repetition of such difficulties as arose last year from any local or general depletion of stock rendering distribution impracticable.The principle suggested is that imports should be such as not to allow for actual consumption on a bigger scale. (It will be observed that the principle as defined in the Transport Councils letter differs in this respect from theA i
reference to it in the Food CounciFs resolution.) It is not of. course the wish of the Transport Council that stocks should be reduced to such a point as to cause actual privation of some of the necessities of life in certain areas.(2) The general tonnage position has been indicated generally in the CounciTs previous letter. In a shipping position rendered more difficult by the large net losses of tonnage available for European service and by the effect of the American Army programme, the one substantial factor of relief was the better harvests in the three European Allied countries and in the nearest source of America. If the principle of the Food Council were accepted this one factor of relief would operate solely to the advantage of food and would not only mean that no assistance would be given in supplying the American Army, but that the imports of the European Allies other than food would in addition be reduced in correspondence with the net losses of European tonnage. This is, in the opinion of the Transport Council, a situation which it is impossible to contemplate.In the above circumstances the Transport Council will not feel justified in asking the military and munitions authorities to reduce their demands upon tonnage (with a consequent reduction of the numbers of American soldiers available for next year&apos;s campaign) in order that such tonnage may be allocated to food as to enable and encourage consumption upon a more generous scale than during the past year.The Secretary, j.

APPENDIX 3.Allies Maritime Transport Council Memorandum as to Executive and ProgrammeCommittees.At the Paris Conference of December last the question of Allied imports and tonnage was considered, and with a view to making the most advantageous use of the available shipping it was agreed by the Allies that &quot;America, France, Italy, and &quot; Great Britain will all tabidate and make available to each other a statement showing &quot; in detail and as nearly as possible in the same form each class of requirements for &quot; which tonnage is needed, and, secondly, the tonnage available and likely to be &quot; available through new building, &amp;c. These requirements having been classified &quot; (showing the source of supply, &amp;c.J and having been adjusted (a) to secure a &quot; reasonably uniform standard of adequacy both as between classes of commodities &quot; and as betweed countries, and (6) to bring the total within the carrying capacity &quot; of the Allies as a whole will form the basis on which the general allocation of &quot; tonnage will be determined.&quot;As a result of decisions taken at that Conference the Allied Maritime Transport Council was formed, consisting of Ministers from each of the three chief European Allies with a delegate from America, and was charged with the duty of examining the use of all tonnage under Allied control with a view to allotting it to the services most essential to the prosecution of the war. The CounciPs powers are limited to making recommendations for action to the respective Governments, who retain final control over the movements of their own ships.As there is a general shortage of shipping when set against import requirements, it was realised that the Counoil&apos;s recommendations would necessarily involve decisions not only (a) on the relative importance of the various import requirements, but also (b) on the relative needs of the several Allies for a particular commodity. It was therefore further decided at Paris, for the purpose of obtaining the best opinion as to the total amount required of a particular commodity and as to its distribution among the Allies, that Allied bodies (Programme Committees) should be formed for the different main requirements (food, munitions, raw materials, &amp;c.) on the model of the Wheat Executive, America being associated Avith these bodies. It was contemplated that the formation of expert Allied bodies of this nature would greatly simplify the work of allotting tonnage, as considered programmes for each article would be rendered available, and that where the total of all the programmes exceeded the carrying capacity, the Transport Council would be able to discuss possible reductions of programmes with the Committees before proceeding to make recommendations to the Allied Governments as to what reductions must be made.It may be conveniently stated here that the Transport Council will work in close co-operation with the Inter-Ally Council on War Purchase and Finance, documents being interchanged between the two Councils, and that it is understood that the latter Council are strongly in favour of the appointment of Programme Committees to assist them in their task of considering imports in relation to finance.At their last session in Paris on April 23rd 25th, the Transport Council adopted a statement as to the general tonnage and import position for 1918, showing that the import programmes of the three European Allies for 1918 exceeds the carrying capacity available by some 8^ million tons. It is, therefore, urgently necessary that these import programmes should be revised and reduced. Except in the case of cereals, meats and fats, and nitrates, the demands of each Ally for a particular commodity have not been criticised by a joint Allied body dealiDg with that commodity. The Council accordingly felt that it was imperative for the Allied Governments to proceed at once with the formation of joint expert bodies which should investigate the demands for commodies other than cereals and nitrates. A copy of their Resolution&quot;8&apos; is enclosed, attention being particularly called to paragraphs 3 (a) and 6.The associated Governments are anxious that the Programme Committee should be instituted and commence their effective work at the earliest possible date.From the point of view of the Transport Council, the work which it is hoped the Programmes Committees will undertake may be provisionally described as follows :  (i) To obiain such information as is necessary to determine the requirements of each Allied country for the commodity or class of commodities with which the Programme Committee is concerned, including past consumption and stocks.* See page -1, Minutes of Second Session.
(ii) To secure effective Allied criticism, of the requirements, so that the Programme distributes the sacrifice entailed by any necessary shortage as equally as possible between the different countries, and in such a way as to bo least injurious to the prosecution of the War.(iii) To prepare a programme for such period, or periods, and on such a basis as the Council may desire, the programmes of all being as nearly as possible comparable and uniform, and also being so designed as to enable them to be readily adjusted to tonnage calculations in view of the varying strain imposed upon tonnage according as the country of shipment is near or distant. (Appropriate forms are being circulated by the A.M.T.C.)(iv) To forward the programmes so prepared to the Council with all such supplementary information as to stocks, &amp;c, as will facilitate a decision between the competing claims of imports for tonnage.(As regards the competing claims of different countries for their share of a given commodity, it is desirable that in every possible case the Programme Committee should agree upon the distribution without appeals to the Council, the Councirs main consideration being, eg., the competing claims of cereals and munitions, not the competing claims of France and Great Britain for cereals.)(v) To discuss possible reductions of programme with the Council and its permanent organisation, when forecast of available tonnage show&apos; a deficiency as compared with the total of all programmes. The present position being that a reduction of imports is inevitable, it is proposed, as soon as the total requirements of the Programme Committees have been examined afresh, in relatiou to the tonnage expected to be available during the rest of this year, to make a provisional plan for reduction which will bring the total imports within the capacity of the tonnage, and to ask the several Programme Committees what redistribution they would make among the Allies on the assumption of such a reduction and what would be the position of each country as a result, having regard to its stocks, &amp;c.25th May 1918.APPENDIX 4.Allied Maritime Transport Council Memorandum as to Relation of Import Programmes to Tonnage and to the American Army.The procedure which it is proposed to adopt, on receipt of the programmes from the different Programmes Committees, in order to adjust imports to the carrying power of the available tonnage, has been explained in Memorandum B, dated .18th July 1918.*It may, however, be convenient to Programme Committees, while they are still framing their programmes and before forwarding them to the Allied Maritime Transport Council, to have, some general indication of the relation of tonnage to the problems they are considering and of the effect on the Allied cause of any extra or reduced demand Avhich alternative policies may entail.The general tonnage position may be roughly summarised by saying that while world building now exceeds world losses, this is due to the increased American building, and all new American building must be absorbed by the Additional American Military requirements. In considering European imports, therefore, it is necessary to consider the relation of world losses and world building without allowing for relief to the situation from American building. Excluding America, world losses continue of exceed world building to a serious extent; in the first six months of this year the excess of such losses amounted to about 1^- million tons deadweight. Against this must be set the reduced demand on shipping which may be expected to result from improved harvests.In view of the numerous factors of uncertainty it is difficult to forecast the tonnage position with precision. One dominant fact, however, suffices to give a criterion by which Programme Committees may assess the value of shipping consideration in framing their policy.As Mr. Hoover stated at the Food Controllers&apos; Conference on July 23rd, the limiting factor to the increase of the American Army is the shipment of supplies.* Priutetl as Appendix 7 of previous report of action.
nAmerica will send as many troops to France as the available shipping suffices to supply.The actual shipment of the men is a manageable task. The whole problem is supply. It may be roughly estimated that every man sent to France entails the shipment of some 5 tons of supplies or the continuous employment of about 1 gross tons of shipping.Wherever therefore a Programme Committee has two alternative courses, one of which may present certain advantages from the point of view of finance or increasing the comfort of the civilian population, while the other would affect a saving in tonnage, they can roughly estimate the cost to the Allies&apos; cause of adopting the first course by reckoning that every 5,000 tons saved in imports into Europe means 1.000 additional American troops in France.Lancaster House,24th July 1918.
