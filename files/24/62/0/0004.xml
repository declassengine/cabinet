WKM0i4ptoI OF THE lltim SECRETARY AS TO PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTSp T       ylp. I cWyO IS THE AE(m IK ISTR AT ION OF REGULATION 40D. &apos;g*HALL ^1. Discharge from Prison at expiration of sentence of prisoners suffering from Venereal Disease,      . -It is of oourse impossible to detain suoh prisoners upon the expiration of their sentences or to exercise any direot oontrol over their movements after their release: but in future the   Prison Medioal Officers will be instructed to inform any woman who mas to bo discharged before being cured 0f the necessity for further treatment and of the facilities provided by the State for such treatment, and to warn her of her , lability under Regulation 40D.   Governors of Prisons will also be instructed to give &apos; to the Police confidentially the names of all such women,- This will enable the Policein the event of the arrest of one of these women upott a charge of soliciting to pro- &apos;-eed with greater confidence tu charge her under the Regulation, and the evidence of jthe Medical Officer will be available as to her condition upon release.2* Privacyi   The suggestion that greater privacy might be attained by a woman being&apos;&apos;&apos; rought in the. first instance before a single Magistrate sitting in private has: been ound on consideration to be impracticable.   The woman must be arrested.upon a WarrantIssued by a Magistrate, and the Summary &quot;Jurisdiction Acts provide that she must be irought before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction and publicly charged.   Magistrates willfiowever be recommended to request the representatives of the Press not to make public he name of any woman charged under the Regulation who claims to be examined, by a-     -lootor until the result of such examination is known. . ..  .3, Consent to examination to be in writing,..   Those opposed to the Regulation constantly complain&apos; either that the woman has not n fact consented to be examined or that she has not fully&apos; understood her right to efuse to do so.    I propose therefore in future that when-a woman is remanded to rison under 40D she shall not be examined until her written oonsent to such -examina-ion has been obtained.   A female hospital,officer is always present when a woman is ( , ooally examined by the Medical Offioer of a Prison,4, Proposed amendments of Regulation 40D. - V1 propose to, insert; the. amendment adopted by the Canadian Government-which pro-ides as an alternative: that the examination may be carried out by,a doctor appointed or that purpose by the Court,   The Regulation would therefore run as follows:-&quot;The defendant shall be informed of her right to be remanded as aforesaid and that she may be examined by her own &quot;doctor, or by the Medical Officer of the Prison, or by a dootor appointed for that purpose by the Court.   A defendant  -remanded as aforesaid shall not be examined unless her written oonsent to-suoh -examination has been obtained,&quot;I propose also,to insert a proviso similar to that contained in Clause 5 of the jrlminal Law Amendment Bill, and which would run as follows Provided that -(a) a woman shall not be oonvicted under this regulation if she proves that she had reasonable grounds to believe that she was free from venereal disease in a communicable form at the time the alleged offence was committed, and(b) no woman shall be convicted of any offence under this Regulation upon the eviaenue of one-witness unless such witness be corroborated in some &apos; &apos; material particular by evidence implicating the accused.
It has recently been held that the absence of knowledge by a defendant thui she was suffering from venereal disease constituted no defence&apos;under the Regula-tion.   It ia clear, I think, that the Regulation would become a dead letter if , it wore necessary for the prosecution to prove affirmatively that the women was aware of her condition when she committed the offence, but a woman should bo able to sooure her acquittal by proving that she had reasonable grounds to believe that she was not suffering jfrom disease in a communicable form.I propose also to insert sub-seotipn (4) of Clause 5 of the Bill:-HAn offence, under this Regulation shall be deemod to be an offence towhich Section 29 of the Larceny Act. 1916 (which relates to the domandingof money, eto. with menaces), applies,&quot; Section 29 of the Laroeny Act imposes very heavy penalties for offences of a blackmailing oharaoter, such as aoousing or threatening to accuse persons of any orime to which the Section applies with intent to extort money, and as the offence created by this Regulation is one whioh might be made uso of for purposes of blackmail, the provisions of this Section of the Laroeny Act should be made available as a protection against blackmailing accusations,5. Sxolusion of undesirable women from railway stations and their approaches.The exclusion of und9sirable women from railway stations when soldiers   * are arriving on leave is not a matter in whioh the Metropolitan Police are able to take action, as they have no jurisdiction within the stations whioh are private premises,   I am informed, however, by the War Office that the Military Polios, acting in ooncert with the Railway Police, do at present exclude from the platforms all persons who have not a permit from the Provost Marshal!s: Department to be present,&apos;and that the Railway Police, acting under their special powers, exclude all known undesirable characters from the preoincts of the stations.   It is possible to exclude persons from the platform because they oan be checked.at the barriers, but it would not be practicable to extend the permit system to the station premises as a whole,   Further, I am informed by the Military Authorities that the measures taken by the Military and Railway Police are successful in keeping the station premises clear of women of loose oharacter. The exclusion of undesirable women from the railway premises naturally leads to their congregating in the streets outside, where they oan only be dealt with by the Metropolitan Police for infractions of the law.   I have frequently dis-cussed the question of the condition of these streets with the Commissioner, and I am assured that the Police do everything in their power to cope with the evil.   Much good work is done by voluntary agencies, who get hold of the men upon arrival and arrange for their transport across London or to hostels so as to prevent them falling into bad hands, and I will consider whether anything further can be done to assist in this work, both by clearing stations and by improving the condition of the streets outside. . . . . -Regulation 40D has undoubtedly strengthened the hands of the Police, and even if a comparatively small number of convictions can be obtained, it is likely to have a beneficial deterrent effect.G. 0.26.8.18,4W208-9,
