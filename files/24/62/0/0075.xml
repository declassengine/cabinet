S.T. 5575.   ^ BATTLE CRUISER POSITION AND SHIP-&apos;   BUILDING PROGRAMME.Admiralty Memorandum for the far C abi ne t.The attached tables.(Appendix I) of the British and German battle-crusiers give the. estimated relative positions of thetwo forces, in the North sea at various dates.*. * -In spite of the numerical superiority of the British Force the position cannot either now, or in the immediate future, be considered -as satisfactory.Although a certain amount of additional protection has been worked into the British ships since Jutland, a repetition of the loss of our battle cruisers by the explosion of their magazines is only less possible than was then the case and has not been pre-vented.The armour protection of the German,ships is far more com-plete but the new&apos; A.P.C shell is capable of penetrating it and oi* putting their, ships out of action, if not by exploding the magazines; at least by causing vital damage to propelling machinery and our position is consequently much improved as the vulnerability of both sides is now more equal.The armour protection of &quot;REPULSE&quot; and &quot;RENOWN&quot; calls for serious consideration.   With a belt of only 6 inches they are dangerously liable to destruction by a single hit and in view of their high-speed and powerful armament it is considered that, as soon as the new shell has been supplied to all battle cruisers, no time should be lost in fitting the additional protection which is now in course of preparation for them*With regard to the future.   Table 3 of Appendix I shows that by 1920 the German battle cruisers may be numerically equal to ours apart from the older ships of both sides which will be practically obsolete by then.   If we have any losses in the meantime due,to mines, torpedoes or navigational risks, the Germans will actually be numerically superior, and, owing to our strategical position, our ships operate in waters and under conditions which render them more liable to such risks than the Germans.   The German ships will moreover, on an average, be more modern, faster, better protected and only slightly, if at all, inferior in armament.   (Appendix II).A comparison of the older battle cruisers is shown in Appendix 111 *If construction were recommenced on any of the three battle cruisers &quot;HOWE&quot;, &quot;RODNEY&quot; and &quot;ANSON&quot;, it is estimated that they could be completed by the beginning of 1921.In order to make our position secure in the future with regard.to battle cruisers it is recommended that in addition tothe &quot;HOOD&quot;, two of those should be progressed at.the normal rate.With the object of effecting this and at the same, time assisting in the construction of Merchant Shipbuilding, the Board of Admiralty have given most serious consideration generally to*i r 9Host Sec ret ,^ w w 6
9 C 9 6 J ci9*&quot;     f.y    *&quot;the Warship Building programmes which have been authorised by the War Cabinet, with a view to seeing how far it is possible for them to cut down or retard numbers of &quot;vessels, the construction of which has been authorised, and thus enable men who are now engaged on naval construction to be transferred to merchant ship-building.Such are the exigencies 0f naval warfare, and particuarly of anti-submarine warfare, that the War Cabinet will appreciate that the Board of Admiralty are powerless to effect economies in naval construction unless, they can look with confidence to the United States Government to render material assistance by supplementing, out of the resources now at their disposal, the classes of vessels of which the Allies, stand most in need, but the Board have every reason be believe that it is within the power of the United States Government to render the assistance in this direction which is required.Statements are attached which indicate clearly the economy in ships which the Board of - Admiralty feel justified in accepting (Appendix IV) and the nature of the assistance which is desired of the United States Government (Appendix V), but the War Cabinet will appreciate that this programme of economy is entirely de-pendent upon the required contribution to the Allied Forces in the waters concerned being forthcoming from the United States. Assuming, - however,  that the War Cabinet approve of the cutting-down and retardation of the Naval Building programme to the extent T/hich will effect these economies, and that an arrangement which can be relied upon can be made with the United States Govern ment to provide the assistance indicated, it will be &quot;possible to gradually release to merchant shipbuilding a large number of men now engaged on naval construction, and it is anticipated that the number so released will rise, by the second quarter of 1919,  to an aggregate of about 22,000 men.Such, however, is the uncertainty of naval warfare that the Board of AcumLralty feel it necessary that there should be a clear understanding that,  in the event of a fleet action involving con-si derable losses or &quot;of other circumstances arising rendering it necessary that the output of warships of any particular class should be accelerated,  the,men who as a result of the economies now proposed to be effected, will be released to merchant ship-building should be readily available to be re-transferred to naval construction by the Cabinet on the application of the Admiralty, It will consequently be seen that it will not be possible to make the men so released available for incorporation into the Navy or,Army,It&apos; is desired that the War Cabinet should approve of these / proposals and steps will then be taken to obtain their adoption by the United States Government so far as the United States of America are,concerned., &apos;   (Signed)   ERIC GEDDES*31/8/18.
