Confi&apos;onfidential.I circulate the following notes, which have been prepared in the Intelligence andStatistics for the Week ending the 21st August.During the week ending the 2.1st August, 10,377 days less than one-fourteenth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time-were lost through strikes on munition work.* The greatest loss of time occurred in-the North-Western area, where 6,783 days were lost, 6,000 of them by 1,000 carpenters and joiners in the Manchester district.On the 26th August, no munition strikes were reported as being in progress.-For the last three weeks there have been indications that the strict rationing of fuel, announced by the Coal Controller, may result in industrial unrest prejudicial to the output of munitions. The chief investigation officer at Newcastle reports &quot; general aud intense &quot; indignation at the inadequacy of the allowance. Wales, at the moment of writing, has just begun to murmur ; and the news from Leeds and Bristol is far from reassuring. The general trend of the reports is to the effect that the trouble is unlikely to come to a head until the cold weather causes the pinch to be felt, but that, when the pinch is felt, trouble is almost certain to occur.The danger lies in the fact that the majority of the workers neither comprehend the complications of the scheme nor appreciate the circumstances which have made it necessary. The desirability of educating them in these matters, while yet there is time, has been urged by more than one of the chief investigation officers ; and the suggestion seems a good one. It is a case in which well-considered and energetic propagandism is required to avert the evils which may be caused by wide-spread failure to understand either the embarrassments or the policy of the Government.A potent disturbing force in industrial relations is the claim for higher actual or relative wages. It has been the object of the Ministry of Munitions to regulate wages so as to preserve pre-war standards and relations between different classes of workers. These standards and relations had, however, been fixed by the free play of economic forces and the bargaining strength of workers and employers in each of a multitude of districts and occupations. There was no system to be maintained, but a complex full of inequities, which the less favoured parties sought constantly to adjust.Equitable readjustments have been facilitated in detail by processes of arbitration during the war, but the maintenance of the general relations between the rates for skilled and semi-skilled labour has been rendered impossible by the conditions imposed by the skilled men on the necessary dilution of labour. So far as skilled men have grievances in respect of the rates paid to dilutees, they have themselves to blame. There cannot exist at the same time equality of payment for all persons doing &quot;skilled work,&quot; and specially high rates for those of them who have served an apprenticeship to the trade. So far as employers as a class have a grievance in respect of the cycles of wage increases, they must blame for it the unscrupulous members of* For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals, and rubber) ; and (J)) in certain auxiliary industries, e.g,, iron ore mining, brick making, timber sawing, &quot; certified &quot; gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.

their own class who have offered irregular inducements to workers in order to increase their own output and profits.The play of economic forces has not -ceased during the war. The evils of competition have been aggravated and have had more disastrous consequences than in time of peace. The control of five or six thousand factories by the Ministry cannot create a national and equitable system where no system existed before; it cannot even check the spread and multiplication of abuses for which the temptation is greater than ever. In spite of the -constant application of remedial measures, the wages position has become more and more chaotic. But the fault does not lie with Government control. Control has operated to prevent injustice, but it lias to do so always at the public expense. There has been no State control based on principles scientifically determined and creating an ordered system.
