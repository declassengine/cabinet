I ^&apos;hlR Document Is the PropHis Britannia ^&apos;ajwi:y&apos;&apos;s Government.)Memorandum by the Building Labour Committee representingall Government Departments.The Royal Air Force Reserve Depot at Blandford,.The Building Labour Committee have no objection to any of the plans proposed by the Air Ministry except to the same rate being paid at Blandford as is paid at Winchester!The allowance of this rate would overthrow three or more considered decisions of the Building Labour Committee who have been trying for months to obtain some order in the chaos which now prevails in the Building trade, and would tend to render any further efforts by this Committee useless.   No member of the Committee from other Departments supports the proposal.   It will upset the whole of the Building rates in the lest of England and also affect the Shipyard rates on the South Coast.It will yield to men as the issue of a stride and after they have refused te be enrolled, rates which by enrolment as War Work Volunteers under the National Service Scheme they might possibly have got.   Such a course will prejudice the National Serfice Scheme of enrolment by giving similar advantage to unenrolled as to enroiled men,.   It will draw men off from equally important Government work and be carried out at the expense of other Depart-ments, the railways, agriculture, and munition work of all kinds In the West of England,   Por example if Winchester rates are paid at Blandford they will immediately be claimed on the important work for Tank Sheds at Newbury which is ohly about  0 miles from Winchester, and if Winchester rates were paid at Newbury they would immediately be claimed at the huge Stores at Did cot and probably at all the work at Reading.   It will tend to upset the National Building Conciliation Scheme just completed between the employers generally throughout the country and all the Build--... ing trade unions (except plumbers) with the consent and approval of all the Government Departments.   It will allow a particular contractor to establish the precedent of moving his men from place .. to place at the price of the last job.   This would spread the high London rate through the country by others following suit with men recruited by the system of fraud, now being largely practised, of men going for a few hours to London and calling themselves London men, obtaining a job at. London rates, speading that rate with the connivance of the contractor to other men on the same Job, and then claiming to carry it wherever the contractor takes his men.   The customs of the building trade would go and all local builders be at the mercy of travelling contractors, generally receiving a percentage on costs and thereby reaping greater benefit the greater the expenditure.   Many of those contractors have little or no control exercised over them.For these reasons the Building Labour Committee oppose this solution and have not advised the Ministry of Munitions to sanction the Winchester rate under Statutory Order 732,   Other alternatives besides those offered by the Air Ministry which have been suggested by different members of the Building Labour Committee are,/(a) the
zm September, 1918,^ a) the cancellation of the contract with the contractor whose proceedings have caused this difficulty and the giving of the work to the other contractor now on the spot who follows the usual Building trade customs,and the decisions of the Building Committee without attempt at evasion.&apos; Some strong opinions have been given to this effect.(b) The closing down of a sufficient amount of building work in the neighbourhood if other Departments are prepared to give up their enterprises in order to set free labour at current rates for this contract.(e) the suggestion has also been made for the transfer of this and other Air Ministry contracts to the Office of Works to act as sole authority.   The Office of Works pursue tho usual and proved method and should be able to exercise some control over contiac -&amp;i?s which divided authority has not achieved.. Other Departments ,a,: ;3ht wherever possible do put under the same control and-the&apos;Committee are unanimously of opinion that all new Departments (such as the Ministry of Food) &quot;beginning to give out contracts should be put under the Office of Works.   The principle of one authority, the Office of Works, is also asked for by the Building Trade of   . ScotlandoThe undeniable fact is that the supply of labour for building is wholly incommensurate with the demand and the best use is not made of the labour which does exist.   ):.; the result Departments are bidding: against Departments and contractors against contractors at vast cost to the country and with inefficient production.   Unless there is single control over the amount of labour, the priority of required works in relation to the actaal supply of labour, the power to shut down works for which no labour exists, and some relative control over payments within the building trade arid as between the building trade and other industries,&apos; the present chaos will go^Jrom bad to worse, as the demand for s imilar labour on buiIdings ana in the shipyards continues to increase and the shortage of such labour becomes greater and greater.The Building Labour Committee made certain definite proposals (copy annexed) to. other bodies who appeared to be dealing with. Building Trade questions such as the Works Oonstruction Sub-Committee and the Director of National Service, in June and July last, in order that they might be laid before the War Cabinet, but having received no reply beyond an acknowledgement they now desire to lay  these views before the War Cabinet on their own initiative and request their endorsement.(Signed)        Asmra.&apos;     Chairman^ Building Labour CommitteeBuilding ;Bxecutive Committee. -
Ministry of Munitions of War, 6, Whitehall Gardens, S,W,1, 11th July, i918.Sir,Tho Building Executive Committee desire to obtain the co-operation of the Works Construction Sub-Committee in recommending that a decision should ds given by the War Cabinet with a view to meeting tho situation in the Building Trade.Apart from the importance of schemes to tho State dad the difficulty of obtaining material, there is not now available labour for completing the schemes in hand and this position will become worse,   Sxtravagant demands, collusive agreements, ^poaching&apos; of labour and difficulties of every kind are the result.   Lost time by the migration of labour and the disturbing effects of continual movement seriously impair the bo3t use of such labour as is available.Opinions of officials of the Chief Departments have been obtained and copies are annexed.   After consideration of these reports and hearing suggestions made from practical knowledge of tho Building Trade and tho position of labour, the Executive dommittee desire that you should join them in recommending to fchs War Cabinet(1) That a license Mist be obtained if the cost of any private building Jot) will exceed&apos;  250 (see minutes from Ministry of Munitions and War Office) and that this license should be required for the whole repairs, changes or extensions of any premises which must be lumped together and not treated as ^aqptrate jobs   and that no person for the same building shall receive any new license except after a period of twelve months, idh-erence to Statutory Rule and Order lfo*742 should be made a condition of the license.( -) That refusal should be given to any further building works Government or private, unless it can bo proved that they.are immediately and directly essential to the successful conduct of tke war jseo minute from Admlr&amp;lfty and schedule to Which particular attention is drawn).(3) That temporary accommodation should be of the simplest form and as far as possible of the same standard for all Government services:.   All luxuries should be discountenanced, (see minute from Admiralty).(4) That there should be closing down or slowing down of many Works already in hand in order that available labour may naturally flow to those Works that are most important and that all Departments be required tt &quot;comb dswn&quot; their $orks to essential services.cm,LJEU 15207/26,1./ (5) That
(5) That except in special cases authorised in advance by the Building Labour Committee no allowance or extra payments not recognised under the working rules of the district.shall be made.(6) That in the matter of wages Statutory Rules and Orders 742 be strictly complied with.(7) That with the exception of enrolled mon such as War Munitions Volunteers, Army Reserve Munitions Workers, War Work Volunteers etc. supplied by the Labour Supply Depart-men ts of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of National Service, labour should not be brought on to the job from other districts at rates higher than the looal rates, unless with the express permission of the Building Labour Committee given in advance.(8) That the Defence of the Realm Regulation 8B should be amended with a view to preventing inducements being offered to workmen engaged on building work as defined in Statutory Rules and Orders 742 by advertisement or otherwise.(9) That Employment Exchanges should co-operate in endeavouring to avoid the migration of labour from jobs whore it is required.(10) That the Labour Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions should co-operate in securing the dilution of building trade labour by the employment of female labour wherever practicable.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) G.R.

CIVIL iilN&amp;IK^R-IIMJHIE^S DSPARTIl^NT ADMIRALTY LABOUR M BUILDING &amp; CONSTRUCTIONAL 10IKS.If the supply of labour obtained from the labour Exchanges i3 any criterion of the labour available in the country for the works in question, then the demand for labour   is greatly in excess of the supply available.2. It is believed that tnaufltriea amh as fabricated ship I, &apos;construction and manufacture of aircraft, have, and are, still depleting the building trade ranks.3, The amount of labour apparently available, coupled with the amount of Government building rork in hand5 leads to exorbitant demands by the workmen and is the basic cause of our labour troubles.4. This Department has exceptional difficulties ii/carrying out many of their Torka owing to their being situated far from centres of population and often in prohibited military areas, eug. Orkney Islands.   jJith the present competition for labour, workmen prefer to work in the vicinity of large towns where there are &quot;amenities&apos;7.5. No improvement is to be anticipated, until the demands for labour is approximately equal to the available supply.   There is little chance of reaching this desired result until Priority is given with less facility and the financial limit of  5,000 is considerably reduced.6. It is believed that the position with most Government Depart-ments to-day is that competition for labour is raising the cost of the works.   Progress is too slow, and the number of uncompleted works in hanu is larger than it ought to be and apparently tends to grow.7, It is suggested that with a view to remedying the present position, sanction should be refused to any further building works un-less it can be proved that they are immediately and directly essential to the successful conduct of the Var.8c Temporary accommodation to be provided should be of the simplest and least extravagant form, and should be of the same standard for all Government services and should not include any luxuries such as it Is customary and reasonable to provide in peace time.(Signed) AL3XANDICR GIBB.

MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS OP WAR, 6, Whitehall Gardens, London, S.V/.1.THE   POSITION   IN   THE   BUILDING   TRADE *Por some considerable time it has become more and more evident to the Members of the,Building Labour Committee that there was a very serious shortage of labour both skilled and unskilled in the trade.   As evidence of this the return for the week ending 7th June 1918 from the Labour Exchanges may be cited.   The unsatisfied demand at that date for skilled men was 4,565;   the number af skilled men supplied during the week was 427.   The unsatisfied demand for unskilled labour wa.j 3,077 and the number supplied during the week v/as 419,   When it is remembered that the number of demands placed with the Exchanges are only a fraction of the unsatisfied demands of the Contractors, it is clear that there is a quite inadequate supply of labour to carry out the present jobs.   The fact that the supply is so insufficient has Important effects:-(1)   It leads,employers to give all kinds of extras inaddition to sometimes paying rates in excess of the local agreed rates so as to attract the services of men and thus earn profit on their labour.(2)   The workmen and the various Trade Unions are exploiting the situation to the uttermost with the result that wages are increasing by leap3 and bounds.   Allowances that would never have been paid in normal conditions are now being paid.(3)   The output obtained from the available labour is d-minished as the workman instead of really putting his heart into the jeb on which he Is engaged has his eye on some other job v/here he may get a higher rate,   Further, it takes a workman when he has changed his job some little time to get quite accustomed to the new job with the result that output is again diminished.   There is also the loss of output due to the time lost by the men in changing jobs./If
If the present position is to be alleviated it is abaolut ly essential that the available labour should be concentrated as far as possible on those building works which are most essential.     &apos;2o effect this it may be necessary to oloce down a great many jobs now being carried on, and, in any case, it absolutely essential that no new job should be started for some considerable time.   It is also a matter for considerate^ whether the present arrangements under which licence is given for private building jobs should not be modified;   whether it should not be made necessary that a licence should be obtained if the cost exceeds half the present limit of  500, and it would also appear necessary to deal with what is known as &quot;tacking on&quot;.   It may be urged that if the amount of the building work to be carried out was limited to that which was most essential and due regard was ha  to the amount of labour available, the result would be that more buildings would be constructed In a given time than under the present arrangement and also that the cost of those buildings would be oonsiderabl) less.(Sgd)   H. il MaCDOMD.4. 7. 18,
WAR OFFICE, Imperial House, Tothill Street, S.W. LABOUR POSITION IN THE BUILDING TRADE.This question was considered at an informal conference, held bn 3rd July, 1918, of representatives of War Office Branches primarily concerned, whose views were as follows:-(l) The labour position in the Building Trade is of such gravity that it is essential that it should be brought to the notice of the War Cabinet with a view to steps being taken to deal with the matter,(2) The difficulties in the existing position are due mainly toi-(i) The shortage in the available supply of labour&apos;, and the inadequacy of the arrangements for concentrating it on work of primary importance.(ii) The payment of extravagant rates of wages, usually much in excess of the district rates, and. of high Subsistence and other allowances to imported men In order to attract the necessary labour for jjrrportant service.(lii) The consequent excessive and unregulated migration of labour in search of the best-paid jobs.1&apos;(3) The measures which should be talien in order to deal with the situation thus created seem to be:-(i) The closing-down or -slowing-down of many of the works already in hand so as to concentrate the available labour on the most import ant; and the limitation of new works to absolutely essential services,   It is believed that if a systematic review were made of the whole Government building programme, and a slowing-down of the less vital/services
services were arranged In such a manner as to secure (a) a correspondence between the amount of labour available for each successive stage of building operations and the requirements of the works In hand at that stage and (b) a consequent flow of men of the various trades from one job to another in proper m.rsuccession, the number of works which would have, to bewp definitely closed down would probably be found to be smaller than might be anticipated,It may be stated that, so far as the Y/ar Office is concerned, for many months past a very strict scrutiny fl has heen made of all building proposals, and new works i] &apos;&apos;/&apos;;  have been limited to essential services of urgent Importance.(ii) A stricter limitation of work carried out for private employers.   It is thought that (a) the limit of value for jobs which may be put in hand without a special permit should be reduced from  500 to  200 or lower, and (b) it should be made a condition of the grant of any such permit that the Contractor should undertake not to pay wages or allowances in excess of those        .!j authorised under the Ministry of Munitions Building &apos;   j Wages Order of 14th June last. ;\\(iii) The disallowance of walking time or allowances exceptin special cases and in accordance with strictly define; rules; free travelling by tram, rail or motor-lorry being of course still permitted where necessary.(iv) A stricter policy on the part of Government Departments as regards (a) the granting of permission for the importation of labour at special rates, and (b) the allocation of contracts, which should always be allotted with special regard to the amount of labour the proposed Contractor already has at his disposal and the place at which It is situated.(v) The elimination as far as possible of avoidable migratf of labour in connection with the&apos; allocation of labour through the labour Exchanges,4th July, 1*918.(Signed) N.F.B.0SB0RN.
,  , 3 t(j ihomaoffice ofworks, t storeyrs gate, .WESTMINSTER, S.W.1, 4th July 1918. Although the Office of Works has suffered from lack of labour on its urgent war works it is of opinion that the deficiency is duo not so much to scarcity of men as to the ineffoctlve use of the men available,      It has boon alleged that prime cost contractors to Government Departments have taken on to a work large numbers of men of various trades and of the navvy and labourer class with a viow t ^having all tho men on the spot in readiness for the work they will have to do at some future date.    This means that much valuable labour is lying idle &amp;rA is being paid for doing nothing,and it may be worth while enquiring as to what truth there is, if-any, in this statement.     It is suggested that some centralindependent authority should havo the solo power to allocate labour,-in other words all building- labour should be pooled and dealt with-by a controlling hand.     It is believed that if this could be done it would be found that there is in existence in tho country sufficient labour to keep all essential building work going at a moderate pace, with the excoption perhaps of Carpenters, who have been drawn so largely into the Aircraft Factories, and Scaffolders,(Signed) ERNEST.H,BRIGHT.
ti hJMINISTRY OF MUNITIONS. DEPARTMENT OP EXPLOSIVE SUPPLYI Sir George Askwith,t\)       At every meeting of the Building Labour Committee v?e are now pressed by some Department or other to allow an Increase of wages or tho payment of various forms of allowances, which arc in fact simply increases of wages, as an inducement for more men to come to that particular Works, and it becomes moro and more clear that men arc only obtained by enticing toon!.to leave other Government work of, In many cases, equal or greater importance.   One of tho favourite methods of increasing the rates on a particular job now appears to be to introduce a contractor from another district and to ask for him to be allowed to pay London rates to London men, Manchester rates to Manchester men, or Liverpool rates to Liverpool men, or in other cases 9/- country money to men keeping two homes.All these practices clearly do not make more men available for construction work, although they do withdraw men from Government Factories and important Controlled Establishments.\.    ...&apos; &apos;Anothor very strong objection to this practice of allowing Works to employ London or Manchester men at London or Manchester rates is that the contractor is thereby enabled to transfer men from one job to another without having to obtain priority for a given number of men and without having to move them through the Employment Exchange.-  It has, I think become perfectly clear that there is more construction work in hand at the present moment than can properly be carried out with the number of labourers and tradesmen who are available In this country at the moment, and I think It has become clear to tho Building Labour Committee that it would be to tho advantage of all Departments if tho amount of work in hand could bo reduced and no new work started until some of the existing contracts were completed.   In all cases nothing In excess of local rates should under any circumstances be sanctioned,   when the supply of labour obtained locally does not meet the demands, firms should be instructed to follow the procedure laid down, that is, they 7 should make a demand on the Employment Exchange, send a copy of it to the Department responsible for the work, who should apply for priority.   Works given P,2 should, for tho present, receive no.....    /facilities  &quot;
facilities for transferring men from one district to another-All men should be, as far as possible, persuaded by the Employment Exchange to go to Works whioh have been given P.1 and in the &quot; case of Works of speoial inportanoe Super-priority oould bo       % given, in which ease men enrolled as War Work Volunteers or Array Reserve Munitions Workers could bs transferred to these Works from other Works of less importance, as was c;uite recently done in the oase of the poison Gas $aotory near Bristol, where something like 200 Carpenters and .200 Bricklayers were obtained g in tinder a fortnight by means of a levy, the men in such oases    &quot; being sent to the^ob, where they receive the- local rate in foroe plus 17/6 country money i  they have dapandents end are sent to live away from their homes.This is, I believe, a scheme entirely favoured by the Ministry ofNational Service, and would do away with all neoessity for the payment of this 9/- country money, which is leading to su much trouble in soma distiicts,&apos;&apos;; !The Priority Committee, before granting priority for- laboure should. I think, -be asked to oonsider whether a great deal of the labouring work could not be done by women*   in this conneo-tion, I should like to point out tho numbers at present employed at H^Maffactory, Blllingham, which are as follows;^Carpenters    ...      *.e 80* Briuklayere   h*      ...    7     -Other Tradesmen       ... IS Unskilled labourers ...-Men      . * o 197:.-(&quot;,&apos;..    Women   ...  40Woman are now employed there unloading materials, digging trenches for pines, boxing up railway tracks, mixing concrete and doing painting work, and are doing the work extremely well.Women are also employed on similar work at H.M. Factory Avonmouth.In the majority of oases, women do not do as much work as a good workman, but in many cases they do more than some ox the vei inferior men employed to-day. It was stated at Billingham yestei tha%; on the whole, three women were doing more than two men. The Orders undo by the minister of Munitions state that women on this class of work should receive what amounts to about and they do not, of course,receive the 12j$.[Signed) E.FAIRS.Lab.
