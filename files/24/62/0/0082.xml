He proposed that the Conference should proceed to
consider this question from the point of view of whether sufficient economics eould be made...without bringing miners-back from the three Services,The Conference therefore proceeded to discuss in detail the figures given in the first Paper of the Coal Controller,dliery Con- It was decided that -&quot;aption end&quot;ners1 Coal. No alteration- was possible with regardto Item 1 (Colliery consumption and , . miners 1  coal).csiralty. TIE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that, with regard&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; to the distribution of -output for 191^ and the increaseddemands made by the Admiralty for 1916,-totalling l^i million tons, he must explain that with regard to this amount only 8 million tons were directly under Naval control.     The remainder consisted.of 6 million tons for mercantile shipping and 2 million-tons for the Army in France, which was purchased by the,Admiralty Contract Department.     He could therefore only speak, for the 8 million tons&apos;,     Tho policy of the Admiralty had been to build more^coal than oil1-burners, without altering the character of the vessel, in order to save tonnage in shipping.     By economy in tankers it might be possible to use oil-burners in&apos;preference te coal,     T&quot;he oil stocks held by the Admiralty had now crept up, from what Was previously a dangerously low amount, to about half what was considered adequate by the Admiralty authorities. Considerable economy had been made- in connection with mine-sweepers, and more particularly by drastic supervision, the economy in the use of coal per mile steamed had given remarkable results during the.past year.     SIR ERIC GEDDES gave figures emphasizing this-fact-, showing more particular.-, iy how the Destroyer   Flotillas, Light Cruiser Squadrons and Sloops, had materially reduced the amount of coal used per mile steamed.     SIR BR-I.C. GEDDES said that it was obvious that no economy could ,be effected with regard to the coal, directly under Admiralty supervision.i With reference to the 6 million tons used for mercantileshipping, THE SHIPPING CONTROLLER .said that. no. reduction was. possible in this amount, stations having been already starvediports to -  With regard to Item 3. Exports to Allies, Neutrals and Jies,.    &quot; British Possessions, SIR JOSEPH MAC-LAY said that. on this utrals subject Lord Robert Cecil had, expresse d great anxiety, the id--British position was very serious with-our Allies, and nothing could ^sessions,. be taken off the figure we had now arranged that they should ..... be satisfied with.On the.question of the possible output of coal from the Bruay mines-,. SIR GUY CALTHROP said, that he had seon M. Loucheur on this question..&apos;.   South of the Somme, some y ,000 tons a day were, being railed,.     M. Loucheur hoped to increase this,immediately by 7,000 tons;   in October, to 22,000, and in November to 30,000 tons a day.     This would help the situation, but not to the full extent.of the 6&amp; million tons, which were the increased demands of France and. Italy.   In his opinion there should be, from the output from the Bruay mines, a saving of 3. million tons on this item.
TIC MI if I STUB C$ idUIJITIOIfS put forward a suggestion that all Departments should be reduced by a fixed percentage.and proposed1 that 10 per oout. .should be deducted from the required amounts put forward,.excluding the requirements of. the allies...Bunkers... &quot;ith. regard to Item it. Bunkers, it was. agreed thatThere, was. no reduction possible in the amount of 12 million tons required for this purpose.,Railways. &quot;&apos;ith regard to Item 5, hallways,. SIB GUY 0 ALT HE OB saidthat it might be possible to reduce&apos; this amount by 1 million &apos;   tons, but this would mean a very serious reduction in the railway services...      &apos;SIR ALffiR.!1 STANLEY pointed out that the railway traffic was again expanding at the rate of  1,GOO,000 a month comparer! with last year, and that the goods traffic was -increasing at the rate of 60 per cent, over the heaviest rate ever known.In the discussion which took place as to whether any saving could bo secured by tho Admiralty not demanding long haulage for coal for ft aval purposes,, SIR ALBERT STANLEY agreed that - the Admiralty had done everything possible.- to help- in this matter...&apos;7ith. regard to Items 6 and 7, Till) COAL CONTROLLER pointed out that -by means of the Household Rationing:Scheme an economy on the figure- for last year would be &quot;effected to the extent of 8 million tons. .  He v/as strongly of opinion that no further reduction could take place.    The demands on the gas companies&apos; and public- utility companies were constant-ly increasing for munition work.i/^.;.,0ElE CHILL said that-his Department: aimed next yea-  at a diminution of the bulk industries, as it was &quot;desirous of safeguarding, the. more refined products, such as aero enginesTanks,, machine-guns, etc., .  He contemplated -cutting.in not on the- reserve., of fillftflj. shells,, but on the. reserve&apos;., of. forgings and empty shells^ . This would pra-bably mean that the Army would have to put up with the&apos; existing stocks unless, they were of no use. .   hath regard to the steel programme, it; whs- hoped to- increase it&apos;from the 10 million.tons programme of this.year to .12 millions next year..    lor the.first six; months of this year the production had been . about .-5&apos; million .,tons... .. It was hoped that the curve of production vould be bigger in: the-, second half than- in&apos;theehold arid --Indus&apos;&apos;; ;&apos;.The Conference agreed that-  A saving of 3. million tone could be effected on the. increased, demands by France and Italy by tho output of coal &apos; from the Bruay mines..
I -   271m 4 ***first half of the year, owing to new works being opened, but up to the present it hod been slightly reduced owing to special reasons.   If it was found&quot;essential to reduce the increased demands of his Department by 5 million tons, the position must be faced, and at any rate his Department would not be worse off than   it was this year.   MR. CHURCHILL emphasized tho fact that he would Infinitely prefer to do without the 5 million tons than to bring any soldiers back from the front.The Conference agreed that -The increased demands could be reduced by the amount of 5 million tons asked for by the Ministry of Munitions, if the War Cabinet were prepared to face the conse-quence of the diminished output of steel and shellsas trial. With regard to Item 8 (Industrial), THE COAL GQiuTROLLER drew the attention of the Conference to his second ential,     Paper (Appendix II), and explained that he had only shown tly Es-     in this paper seme of tho principal trades which would be tiaT.        affected, but that the total saving of coal, if the pro-?essen-     posals of rationing of industrial coal were accepted, would amount to some 8 million or 9 million tons.   If this were done? the deficit would then be reduced to 6 million or 7 million tons,SIR ADAM -KIMMO urged that the industrial rationing of coal was an extremely difficult and complicated matter, and that he greatly feared the result of any arbitrary cut in any industry.SIR GUY CALTHROP explained that, if these proposals were accepted, it had been agreed that, where such bodies existed the Trade Associations should ration their own trades with the amount of coal available foe those trades.In the discussion which followed, allusion was made to the position which already existed in Lancashire, where a strike was expected on September 9th, and to the certainty of industrial trouble which would occur if the proposals for rationing industrial coal were carried into effect.The Conference agreed that -It was possible to cut down the amount of coal used for industrial purposes by from 8 million to 9 million tons, if the War Cabinet were prepared to face the conso-quences, which would be the certainty of great labour dislocation.A discussion ensued on the subject of a greater output of coal from the mines, and MR. BOIIAR LAW said that he hod seen Mr.Stephen Walsh, who was certain that agroat deal of the voluntary absenteeism could be done away with.   Mr. Walsh had suggested that the Prime Minister might arrive at an,arrangement with the Miners&apos; Federation, whereby if a miner failed to work 80 per cent, of the full time he should be liable to be taken for military service.Slii A. WIMMO was of opinion that this should be very carefully dealt with.   It was unassailable in principle that if a man did not do work which was of national importance he should be taken for the Army, but the miners would say thatany.
9r) 9Questioned as to what 3teps the Army would prefer to take if it were necessary to call miners back from the Services, GENERAL WELLS said that he was of opinion that it would be necessary to take the great majority of the men from France and leave it to the Expeditionary Force to make the choice of men to be returned.    It would take from 3ix weeks to two months before any appreciable number of men were returned, as the strictest investigation would have to take place.THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SERVICE said that he was quite unable to agree that the proposals for returning the men, as put forward in the Board of Trade Paper (G.T.-5542). were practicable.   While time might be saved by returning the most recently recruited men there would be considerable dissatisfaction if these young men were returned, and the miners who had been fighting for four years left in the Army.The Conference decided that --There were two alternatives for the War Cabinet to consider;-(a) To effect the economies sug-gested at the Conference, whereby the shortage of avail-able coal would be reduced from 23 million tons to 6 million or 7 million tons:(b) To return from the three Services a sufficient number of miners to increase the output of coal from the mines to meet the estimated shortage.In order that a scheme should be fully prepared in the event of (b) being accepted by the War Cabinet, the Conference decided that -A meeting of representatives of :-The Admiralty, The War Office,The Ministry of National Service, The Royal Air Force, and The Coal Controller, ,should take place that afternoon to prepare a plan for the best and quickest method by which 25,000 miners could be returned to the mines from the three Services,arrangement of this description would prevent them striking if they wanted to.   At the same time, the percentage of voluntary absenteeism was only about 9 per cent., and if it were laid down that a miner moit work 80 per cent, of full time he was afraid that the maximum would become the minimum, and the miners would give that time and no more.
- 6 -The First Lord, of the Admiralty and the Minister of Munitions also undertook to hold a meeting, in order to decide the best steps that could be taken by their two Departments with regard to effecting an economy in coal for industrial produc-tionj proceeding on the assumptio.li that the imports required by their Departments would be as large as last yearcWhitehall Gardens, S.W., August 31, 1918.
