/ 2 &apos;7-AH CABINET.5 0^    Defence of the Realm Regulation 4Q p.Memorandum &quot;by the Deputy Secretary of state for War.With reference to *7ar Cabinet 46l (M), I circulate , the following nets   as requested in decision (a):-The dangers and temptations to which Dominion troops were exposed in this country was the subject of discussion at the imperial far Conference of last year.    Very strong opinions were expressed and vigorous protests were made,    sir Robert Borden for example said;-&quot;I do not think Canada vail ever again send men overseas to any war unless yre are assured that such conditions as heve met our soldiers will not meet them again.     I say unhesitatingly that if I should be prime Minister in Canada at the outbreak of another war, I would not send one man overseas if the conditions were such as have prevailed during the progress of the present war.    I think it is a horrible outrage that they should be so exposed as they have been&quot;.Something, therefore, had to be done.    The cry for action from the Dominions was the cry of the fathers and mothers of the flower of the manhood of the Dominions.    Young lads vrho had left their homes unsullied found themselves exposed to new and incessant temptation.    Unfortunately some of them succumbed and were ruined in health.    In all cases, they became, at least for a time, wastage of man power, and in many cases, they returned home to be a perpetual danger to the Dominion from which they came.Ho doubt, many people feel strongly, even passionately, about this subject and regard it as being outside the realm- of argument.    But hard, cruel facts have to be faced, particularly in war, and there is no time to apportion the blame for the existence of the disease in a person and to enisr into any argument as to who was pri.marily or remotely responsible for it.    The regrettable fact remains that ev^ry woman with this disease is a centre of infection and each ce* ,re of infection may be as prolific of *ineffectivesi and wastage of man power as German poison gas. A number equivalent to a British division has been out of action on account of it at a precarious period from the point of view of man power.    This meant not only that they were useless to the nation, but a burden to it, for a period varying from three to tan  -months.    During that period the trials and dangers of the firing line, which should properly have been borne by them, had to be borne by others with ever increasing anxiety in the hearts of their people at home who had already borne very often more than their fair share,*STobody has ever regarded this regulation as p^fect, Even legislation on the subject which has received the most maturo consideration of parliament will certainly have its critics, will certainly arouse passions and prejudices, and will certainly have Its defects.    3ut parliament empowered the Government of the day to issue in a cas-. of urgency regulations of this xind in the interests of the safety of the roaln, and in this case, it was considered urgently necessary to issue this regulation, not only for the safety of our dominion troops, but for the safety of our own.Recently
Recently the Dominion Government has issued a similar regulation in Canada and our American Allies, with knowledge Of the dangers and the facts, have asked that it should &quot;be extended to include   their troops.    It would not appear; therefore, that rth* regulation is as reprehensible in its scope and nature as the agitation organised &quot;by a certain section of the community, an agitation too often unreasonable and unreasoning, would ask us to &quot;believe.Apart from the uncompromising opposition of those who will resist any attempt &quot;by the state to touch this subject, the attacks upon this regulation have centred around certain points.(i)     It is said that it is one sided.     It penalises the woman who is the source of infection if she communicates it to a member of Hie Majesty&apos;a forces.It will be noted, however, that it does not refer at all to the civilian male population, but merely to soldiers and sailors, the defenders of the realm, who must be kept healthy and strong.    Moreover, it is not true to suggest as is dono that a soldier gets off scot free.    If he contracts this disease -and conceals the fact he is court martialled, and the penalty upon proof that he has done so is imprisonment with hard labour for two years.    if he does not conceal it but reports it in the ordinary way, he goes to hospital and loses all his pay and emoluments, and his wife loses her separation Allowance during the time that he is there - no small punishment and no ineffective deterrent.(ii)    It is said that this regulation is merely an attempt by men to make *vice safe? for man.&quot;This phrase is merely a revival from the discussion of the old C.D. Acts.   In reality it has no bearing upon this regulation and is merely introduced for the purposes of prejudioe. If it is intended to mean anything now, it ought to mean, in view of what is stated above, that it is an attempt to keep the realm safe.by stamping out centres of Infection which injure the fighting capacity of the nation,.    Vice can never be safe, but our fighting men should be guarded as   effectively as possible from the temptations of vice and from the dangers arising from it.(iii)    it is said that this regulation is both ineffective and unworkable.    There has been so far no sufficiently great experience of its working to justify any such positive assertion. -It is true that cases brought under it have not been successful for one reason or another, but it is equally true that many cases have boon successful and if it be true, as it probably is, that each of these successful cases represented a centre of infection which was daily and weekly responsible for its quota of Incapacitated fighting men, no one can fairly assert that a regulation which suppresses infection in this way is useless or ineffective.    As to its being unworkable attempts are being made to make it so by its violent opponents.   This is, of course, a question of administration and I understand that the Home Secretary is dealing with this side of the question, particularly with the thorny question of publicity and medical exaioination.26th August, 1918(Intd.)
