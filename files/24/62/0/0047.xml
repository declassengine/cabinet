On fuller con-si&amp;eratioir ,  however, I decided not to make it public but to send it to you which I now do.I hope if you consider it half as important as I do that you will bring the matter before the War Cabinet with a view to an immediate remedy.Draft of proposed letter from Mr. Joynson Hicks,, to the Lditor of &quot;The Times&quot;. &apos;.Lord v,;eir recently made a long statement to the Lcmbors of tho House of Commons and still more recently arranged for a display of machines to the Members at an aerodrome near London. This speech and this display undoubtedly gave groat satisfaction but I fear thoy created a sense of undue optimism in tho minds of kembers. It-has boon known for some time past that the engine position, upon which everything- turns, is not satisfactory, and as many of my colleagues have recently said to mo in consequence of these two events that they presume I am now satisfied with the Air service, and as I know the&apos; public outside does to some extent regard-mo as a kind of &quot;watch dog&quot; on the iiir ministry, I feel I cannot by silence any longer accept even&quot;a semblance of responsibility. I accordingly place before the country the following facts:-fl) The making of aeroplanes As nothing;,they can be turned out by the thousand.   The making of engines, in particular high power ones is overything.(2) Lord v/eir, in his previous appointment, has for two years boon responsible for the engine production of this country.Believe mo,.  Yours sincerely,(Signed). W, JOYNSOH HICICS,(ii)Sir^
(5) During that&quot;period no real effort at standardization hal been made and there are, or were a&quot; month ago, at the varjbua JroritJ far too many different types of engines with over 100,000 differed spare parts, all of them being oupplied through tho Supply Depart!(4)   On the 9th of July last year the Prime Minister in Usciw Session gave certain &quot;figures, presumably supplied to him by Lord j Weir - then Sir William Weir - as to the output of air engines. These&apos; figures were given month by month, rising to a maximum in April of this year*(5)   These figures were not stated to include foreign engines and Members were left to assume that they were English productions(6) Including, however, foreign engines the supply has never: reached more than 65 per cent, of suoh figures,(7)   The BUi .y is no greater to-day than it was three months&quot;(8) Obsolete engines such as Anzani and small h,p, Ourtiss i Renaults are still being delivered and swell even the small total with entirely useless engines.v(9) &apos; There are nearly 5,0CC new aeroplanes stored away waitii for engines, including 1,500 of the best fighting scout types, such as SE5 and Sopwith Dolphin which are urgently needed at the Front.(10)   Lord Weir&apos;s statement that this is an advantage because can transfer an engine from a smashed machine to a new one is childish and ni&amp;iculous, as everyone knows that in 90 per cent, oi the crashes the first thing that goes is the engine.(11)   On the  7th June in reply to a question by me the Under-Sec retary for the Air said &quot;It is anticipated that all machines surplus to requirements will be fitted with engines before long** A visionary anticipation,as since that date the surplus has largel increased. ,(12) Throughout the war we have been dependent upon France w Italy for one-third of our engine supply, and we are now trusting American output, which has not yet come in any. numbers.(15)&quot; Quite recently Lord Feir went to Paris to beg some more engines and the whole world has seen hie pitiful telegram to General Brancker in America urging him to hurry up the &quot;Liberty&quot; Engine.(14)   The &quot;Liberty&quot; engine may be a great success;-   it has not yet been tested in actual fighting.(15)   The&apos; &quot;Liberty&quot;, engine has not been and will not be at any time this year   delivered within 50 per cent, of the expectation,(16) In any case it is a disgrace;to an engineering nation 111 Great Britain with two years ,of Lord Weir to help us that we shoulj be still dependent on foreign engines. 1(17) A programmed was prepared for nest year!o engine output 1 during Lord Rothermere^a tenure of office of Secretary of State) I that programme remains prepared, but not acted upon.  -(13) The Air Service in the recent fighting has done magnifij oently with the means at its disposal, but it has- in no sense v;onl the war.
r   3  *(19)   Had we possessed treble the number if machines at the /$ot Which we have had the war would have been won last year.   These machines might quite easily have been built if a proper engine, pro-gramme had been laid down two years age.(2o)   There is no sign of any engine programme such as is necessary to win the war in the air next year.(21)   The only way of doing this is to arrange new, fer the return, immediately the present fighting is over, *f 100,000 men to demote the winter to the production of air engines, but if that is decided the initial arrangements must be made to-day.I have confined myself tr the engine-question.   There are-many ethers that need consideration&apos;; the lack of organisation at the Hotel Cecil is beyond words, the imposition on youn: pilots Of the nev blue uniform is cruel, but these are, after all, unim-portant compared to the vital need of engines.I have always fought for the needs of the Air Service, I have always believed in it ana in the possibility of winning the war by its instrumentality, but we shall not so win it under the present organisation and with the present programme.Yours faithfully,(iii)Note by Lord Y/eir on Mr. Joynson Hick^ draft letter to&quot;The Time3&quot;.I annex herewith a draft letter to the &quot;Times&quot; sent to the Prime Minister by Mr. Joynson Hicks, M.P.In view cf the character of the letter, I consider it advisable that it should be- oirculated along with seme notes by myself.I have no means of knowing whether the statement I made to the Members of the House of Commons and the exhibition of war type aeroplanes has or has not created a sense of undue optimism.   My sole intention was to give information to the House of Commons whith had not previously been given tc them, and to which I consider they Were legitimately entitled.X am unaware how the public outside regard Mr. Joynson Hicks, but my feeling of personal responsibility - is in no sense due to the character of interest in the- Air Force which is shown by the annexed letter.I will take the different points seriatim.1.     The increase in the production of aeroplanes in this country in the last 18 months, under the general conditions applying to industry, has been very considerable, and I doubt whether the very eapable designers, constructors, and workpeople would be prepared to regard the performance as nothing.With regard to the supply of engines, I haveeonsis-tently informed the Government that from the supply point of view this has been, ana would be,  the limiting factor.
A2. 1 waa responsible for the engine production in this country for a period from February, 1917, to April, 1918.3.     I havt! always agreed that there are too many different types of engine in use.   The reduction in typea has progressed as rapidLy as was possible to achieve without on the one hand standarising something which would not go out of date too rapid-ly, and secondly, to maintain a strong and efficient force under the supply limitations brought about by existing war conditions of industry.4,     I am unaware of the figures used by the Prime Minister at the Secret Session.5.     I am unaware whether those figures specifically dealt with home and foreign engines.     The figures which I have given have either been the total number of engines estimated to be deliver-ed to the Service, without reference to origin, or else specific numbers and source of origin have been stated.6, l-Tot having the exact figures, I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of the statement.7.     The total deliveries of engines for the lcist three months are as followa1918.Hay - 2,771 June - 2,578 July     -    2,8548.     Deliveries for last three months include -1918.	Hay	June	July:	Total - 3 months.Anzani	Nil	1	Nil	1Curtisa	53	201	Nil	254Renault	185	143	152	480   &apos;The deliveries of Renaults as already explained to the tyar Cabinet have been due to the identical policy advocated by Mr. Joynson Micks, that of standardisation.fty first action in liarch, 1917, was to atandarise the 80 Renault as a training engine.   Through the development in modern flying instruction^ the engine is no longer suitable for training, and we require to take deliveffyof a certain number of the engines while the manufacturers are changing over to the other engine.   If this course was taken then the labour could not be retained in the factories /The Curtiss engine was ordered to help us with the same type of training machine, and the deliveries were retarded by slow progress in America.   These engines are still used by our 20 training squadrons in Canada.(9)     The reasons for aeroplanes being delivered and put in store are as follows
(a)   The FightingSftoout type8, S.E.5. and Dolphin, uoe Hispano-Suiza engines, the supplies of those cone largely from French factories under contracts pLaood before the Ministry of Munitions took over aeronautical supply.   These engines have been delivered in an unsatisfactory condition, requiring part3 to be replaced and complete reassembly and tests.   Accordingly, tho delay caused by the non-availability of these: engines has rendered it necessary to store the machines,(b)   Actual deliveries of aeroplanes are for the moment in excess of engine deliveries.(10)   1 did not state that an engine oould be transferred from a smashed machine to a nor one,   The statement I made was to the effect that by holding a stock of a service type of aeroplane, we are put in a position to replace squadrons by nev; type machines at a very rapid rate, because the wastage at the Front can be made up from stock, thus permitting the manufacturer to go ahead on the now type without requiring also to continue-the manu-facture of the eld type for wastage.   Mr. Joynson Hicks has con-fused this with another point which I made, as follows.Taken over a period of a year&apos;s history of a squadron, more aeroplanes are required than engines,  the wastage rate being approximately b0% per month on aeroplanes, and 4 to 6% on engines.   It is not the case that in 9of0 of crashes the -first thing to go is the engine,(ll)   When the Under-Secretary made his statement, the Ministry of Munitions anticipated a quicker rate of delivery of rebuilt French Hispano engines than has taken place.   J.n iaddition, it has been difficult to arrange to retard the rate of delivery of aeroplanes.12)    The deliveries from France and Italy as compared with the &quot;British output over the 12 months ending 31st July 1918, are as fellowsBritish        French        Italian        Total,18,248 6,867 323 25,438.(13)   1 am not responsible for the supply of engines, and since I have become Air Minister l have never gone to Paris for the purpose stated.   I visited Paris last week in con-nection with the policy of allocation of &quot;Liberty11 engines.My telegram to General Branoker and my earlier tele-gram to Lord Reading, both of which were pro-paired specially for publication in America, received very grave consideration before despatch.   America is passing through a very critical stage as far as her Aviation programme is concerned politically,.The whole policy of standardisation in regard to the &quot;Liberty motor has been assailed by outside critics in somewhat the same manner as Mr. Joynson Hicks assails what he terms our lack of standardisation.   This has had the effect of weakening public confidence in the &quot;Liberty&quot; motor, and has had a reaction and an effect on the manufacturers of the motor and on everyone responsible for the motor.   My telegrams were sent with the deliberate intention of re-awakening American enthusiasm and encouraging America in every
way to push on with: the standardised MIit^nrt^naotor, as I am go fully confident of its very great value to tho Allied cause.General Brancker, Mr, Stettinius, Mr. Lockhart and others, have all informed me that these telegrams have done an immense amount of ^ood in America.(14)   It is statements of this character which do oo much harm in connection with aviation.   Here is the Greatest example in history of standardisation of a novel technical munition of war.   The greatest courage has heen shown.   Results up to the present are estreraely satisfactory.   Doubts ex-pressed no1-&apos; lead to lack of confidence,  slackness in develop-men! and progress, finally, have the effect of weakening pilots confidence,  the most delicate and valuable factor of al 1,(15)   1 am unaware of Mr. Joynson Hioks&apos; expectation of &quot;Liberty&quot; output,  and consequently cannot traverse his statement.   Expectations of &quot;Liberty1: output run from Lord HorthcliffCs 1,000 per day to my own estimate of a final output of approximately 200 per day, and a&quot; present actual output of 2,000 per month.(16)   This statement is an excellent example of lack of appreciation of Great Britain1s war effort.   The phenomenon is not oonfined to those in a position to form sound judgment like Mr. Joynson Hicks, but is widely spread due to lack of information.In reality, the statement could be paralleled by another statement that it is a disgrace to Great Britain and to Prance that they should be dependent on America for the supply of infantry to fight the enemy.   Great Britain&apos;a effort has been to a considerable extent a balanced effort, inasmuch as in every phase of war aotivity she has played a very great part.I indicated to the Oabinet some few weeks ago the conditions under which the Royal Air Force could definitely guarantee- to win the war by air.   Naturally,  the process involved an almost certain risk of losing the war by its adoption.   As a matter of fact,  the whole question regarding aero-engines involves the old factor of skilled labour with which we are so familiar.(17)   The programme in question,  so far as engines are ooncerned, resolved itself into a programme calling for the standardisation of the two Rolls-Royce types of engine,   A very large effort was&apos;made to assist Messrs. Rolls-Royce in every direction.   The results have been unsatisfactory inas-much as the output has not grown to any extent, but it is pcssible that better progress may be made and that the results of the work may show in the near future,(18)    I have no remarks to make,(19)   This is an example of the loose kind of statements made regarding aviation which hatfe done and go on doing so much harm.   It is an example of ill-restrained impatience and of hypothetical belief.   It omits every practical con-sideration.(20)   I have already explained to the War Oabinet that our aviation effort by itself will not van the war next year, but that, it will contribute very largely towards bringing about peace.
(21)     The proposal in identical with that **hJLch I indicated to the &quot;far Cabinet a few woekfj ago.,    I presume-a similar case night he made out for almost any form of war activity.Dealing with the quest ion generally.     The engine question will remain always a certain source of anxiety. The position during the last three months has been bad, and I am&quot; informed by Mr.. Churchill, who is .now responsible for this supply;,, and I fully believe it myself, that the &quot;comb-out.&quot; in fferch is very largely responsible for disarranging the growth of output which was proceeding fairly satisfactorily.There have also been, some.acute technical difficuliies&apos;. If Mr. Churchill is able to replace some of the lost labour,, and the &quot;Liberty&quot; situation continues to improve as it is doing, I am confident we will make a very strong air force.It must be remembered that it,is not altogether a question of engines, the training of .pilots and the growth of all the other branches of the organisation have:to be&apos; carried but.concurrently.     Every step is being taken to balance these developments.I shall be glad to receive from Mr. Joynoon Hicks some details as to the lack of organisation to which he refers., With regard to the,uniform, I an convinced that I had no alternative but,to bring about the change as soon as possible^     The imposition on,the pilots referred to is, in my opinion, grossly exaggerated.... In.conclusion I have,no objection whatever tocriticism,.but in the whole,of,the letter there is not one single suggestion of a practical, useful or constructive nature.28th August, 1918. P.S; &apos;So far as Supply matters are concerned; these notee have the concurrence of the Minister of Munitions.2 Whitehall Gardens. S.W 30th August, 1918.
