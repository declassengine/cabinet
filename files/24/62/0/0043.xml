C) Qh 0A.H.STANLBY.Board of Irado,89th August, 1918.las Goal i*or London.The Ooal Controller  reports to me that the present position of the London Gas Dorics requires that in order to insure a maintonanoe of the gas supply throughout the . winter they should have a six weejc&apos;s stock by about the   1 \ end of tiut third week in October.    In order to secure this it it neoeesary that they should  be provided with a quantity of  100,000 tons per month over the next two months over and afcove tne quantities supplied in the month of July.4Jhis quantity of 100,000 tons  per month must be ob-tained froa Burham.Arrangements have been made for the transport of 40,000  tone per month by rail* and the balanoe of 60,000 tone  per month oan only be brought by sea.The question of the supply of shipping haa been dis-oussed with the Ministry of Shipping, who have been informed that it is estimated, that the output of ooal from Durham will exceed the July output bjr 200,000 tons per month.The shipping Controller however Soes hot feel himself able to acquiesce in the proposal to give the London Gas Companies  priority over iiranoe and  Italy, in view of the present circumstances, without;the War Cabinet!s sanction. If however such sanction is given, or the additional coal pro-vidod, without prejudicing the fulfilment of the:Export &quot;*Programme^ Sir Joseph MacHaj  states that his Department wJLH use their very best endeavours to supply the neces-sary tonnage, which he thinks should be possible.Haling regard to the vital interests oonoerasd in the -maintenance  of the gas supply in London during the winter, and also to tie fact that owing to tba delays of ships i       . at Prenoh ports - whioh I understand In present dreum- . stances make it impracticable to increase the shipments of ooal to fxemo, I should  be glad of a decision by the War Cabinet as to whether tfee Shipping Controller should I not be authorised to give priority to the 60,000 tons per month for two months which it is necessary to transport by sea from Durham for the London Oas Works.
