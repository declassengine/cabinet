Clcmcncoau., .(Soo also G..T..5277,.; Gr.&apos;.T.. 5454,, and G.T., 55,52 ).Dear Monsieur Clomonceau,.I have received the hoinorandum telegraphed from Paris through Lord Derby in which you ask that Groat Britain should maintain 50 British divisions j &apos;. in addition to tho 10 divisions, from tho dominions,, on tho Western, front during next year-, and in which you give certain reasons for believing that it is.-, easily possible for.Great Britain to do this.-?&apos;At: tho outset of your Memorandum you state that you have boon &quot;examining certain assertions made by the Imperial War Cabinet tending to show that the British Empire has arrived at the end of the sacrifices which it can make in the common cause&quot;0   I have no recollection that any such assertion has over been made by tho Imperial .War Cabinet, by myself, -or by any responsible British luinistor and I should bo glad.to know on what evidence this state-mont is based. , I must categorically state that it is the deter- &apos; ruination of the people of: the British Empire, in the future as in tho padt, to dovotc tho whole of their, resources to tho supremo task of winning a decisive victory in the war.   The solo question to be discussed is the resources available and the manner in which those resources can best bo employed for that end,&apos;/Before giving you an answer.&apos;.to your main question I fool it necessary to deal with the report, on the use of British llan-PoworIT,     made by Colonel Rouro^x upon which your conviction is clearly 77.   based that Great Britain has &quot;more than two additional millionsof men who have never been mobilised&quot;-with whom it would be possi-blo for us to maintain the 50 British divisions in the field,. I have read Colonel Rourcrs report with great care,    It appears&apos; to me to. be an unscientific, misleading and fallacious document.. I: append a memorandum dealing with Colonel HoureTs&apos;report in dotaily 1 -will now only summarise briefly our reasons for rejecting it as -   a statement of tho comparative effort made -by franco and Groat Britain and as a guide to- tho use which could be made of British lian-Powor. for the Allied cause... .Colonel. Rourors argument that there is still -a. large avail-able surplus of men of military. ago who have never been &quot;mobilised, estimated by you at more than.two millions of men,., is based upon tho purely arbitrary assumption that it is possible for Great Britain to perform the immense and indispensable services which she now renders to tho Allied cause, over and above the men she maintains in tho fighting lino, on land and sea; with a million workers from among the. men from 19 to 42 years of age,   I have no doubt that Colonel .Rouro has all.the expert qualifications for dealing with the purely military aspect of the problem under discussion.. .. I am certain, however, tlr.it ho has no special qualifications for dealing with the industrial and economic questions which are involved in his pivotal statement that GreatBritain
Britain could continue to discharge her indispensable services to the Allied cause with a million men from 19 to 42.     So   Tar as I can ascertain colonel Roure mads no examination into the economic organisation of this country cn which to base thife estimate.    He brought with him no expertn on industrial organisa-tion, mining, transportation, etc, to enable him to form a judgment.    He.has not even supported his estimate by the opinion of distinguished expert Frenchmen   whose opinion could justly command our respect.     The conclusion which he reaches in the very important enquiry with which.he was entrusted is based on What i* little more than a giiess.*How wide from the mark this guesw ix may be seen from two  road, considerations.     In this first plaoa, th - minimum require-mont-^ for the supply and maintenance of the mercantile fleet and the personnel of the mercantile marine absorb upwards of 1,130,000 men.     Cf these approximately 560,000 are between the. ages cf 19 and.42, and if we add to these the 495.000. ccal miners of military age we find that mere than 1,000,000 men cf military age are employed in coal-mining, shipbuilding, and shipping alone,     If we were to confine the number of men engaged in war industries to 1,000,000 from what souroes cculd re derive our munitions, our agriculture, cur railways, our port labour, our textiles for naval aad military use, and the other servioes vital to the oonduot of -the war, whioh absorb men of military age in France no less than in England?     In the second place, the fact that we do not maintain an extravagant number of men cf military age in these essential war industries may be seen from the effect of the combing out which we made, this year.     Let me take the case of coal.     The miners are the greatest single pool of man-power left in these islands. Under the intense pressure cf the events of March 21st and subsequent v/eoks we released 75,000 miners for the colours.     What is the position to-day?    You vail have seen LI.Loucheur&apos;s telegram cf August 13th, in whioh he lays stress on the extreme gravity of the coal situation in Franoe because we have been unable to main-tain rur coal supplies to your oountry, and even insists that we must inorease our supplies.     You will also doubtless have seen from the press that we are faced with a severe and universal shortage of ooal both for industrial and domesti.i purposes during the ferthooming winter.     The Cabinet have just had reported to them that there will be a shortage of 24,000,000 tons cf coal requires for essential purposes and that even if they, comply with the demand for the immediate return of 50,000 miners there will still be a deficit of 6,000,000 tons on this amouni. n finally I have now received the report of the Allied Maritime WSn&amp;il of August 17th, the conclusion of which is that the only method cf dealing with the &quot;exceedingly serious situation&quot; is &quot;the -increase cf production of coal in the United Kingdom.&quot;     If the withdrawal of les3 than 75,000 men from our largest pool of labour has caused such an aoute shortage bcth to France and Great Britain that we have to,recall miners .from the colours in the hope of making some part of it good, is it likely that we still have 2,000,000 men who have net been mobilised for military purposes?     And what is true af coal is true cf other war Industries also.     Though we have made an unprecedented use of women&apos;s labour both for military and indus-trial purposes, everyone of our essential industries, shipbuilding, munitions, agriculture, and so forth is Glamouring for men and in&quot;&apos; many instances has announoed a. reduction of vital output beoause of this year&apos;s oomb-cut.     In particular I would mention the output sf tp^ks, to whioh I know that Marshal Foch attaohe3 the utmost impcrtanoe.   The output of these invaluable offensive weapons of rar has fallen so alarmingly a3 a result of our recent reoruiting measures that we have been obliged to send ba*k men from the^rmy to the shops.   The plain fact is that we have now reaohed the point when further recruitment of men frcm industry cn a large 3oale is only possible if we could largely diminish the supplies with, which the armies fight and the nations live,    or if we oDuld import the same products from overseas.   Unfortunately neither of these expedients is n practical question.
Colonel Roure&apos;3 Report seems to mo fallacious also vLcri i Ioome3 to the purely military aspects of the man-power problem,    i:e I has throughout ignored the essential difference in organisation I &quot;between an armjj: fighting in its own country and an expeditionary j farce oompelled to perform abroad, with men in uniform, services jwhich would be rendered by oivilians if it were fighting at home. I If we take this and other similar factors into account, Olrnel 1 Houre would appear t* have been widely at fault in his analysis both of the proportion of men retailed for Home Defence in France an and Great Britain and the proportion of non-combatants at the front. Though oaloblations ef this kind are proverbially deceptive the &quot;percentage of men engaged in Home Defence would appear, to be I approximately the same and the proportion of non-combatants to : combatants to be not 56 per cent in the case of the British as compared with 27 percent in the dase of the French,  but 32.7, per cent as against 32.6 per cent.Finally i xnubt refer to Colonel Roure1s remarks in regard to our national part in the war.     Oolonel Roure, in more than one passage in the report,  implies that the people of, these islands are not doing their utmost to win the war and that&apos; their efforts and. their readiness to make, saorifioes for the oommon cause are not to be compared with those of the Frenoh nation.     I wish most emphati-cally to repudiate this imputation.     I venture W believe that history will record that no nation engaged in this war has made a more, complete or unreserved use of their resources, in man-power and material for the Allied cease than the people of Great Britain. Owing to their geographical position, their sufferings, I fully admit, and have -often, publicly admitted; in speaking to British audienoes, have not been nearly so great as those of Franoe,     I am the.last to belittle the matchless heroism of the French nation in defenoe of their own country and the cause of human freedom.     But the achievement of the British forces on every sea and in., every .theatre of war and the tremendous losses military and marine which. they have sustained mostly during the last twe years are proof that the insinuations of Colonel Roure are unfounded and should never have been ma.de.For ,more, detailed criticisms of Colonel Roure&apos;s report I would refer you to the annexed memorandum;,     I do not of oourse wish t.o say that Colonel.Roure1 s report does not contain suggestions 6f value and you may rest assured that we have examined everything .that he has said/ net with the object of contesting it, but with the view of taking advantage of it wherever we can usefully do.so.   But I must make it-olear that after an examination of Colonel Roure1s statist!o-s and o&amp;nolusicns, we totally reject his report-as a basis upon which a profitable -consideration of the use .Qf British man-pewer can be conducted. -   ,We new oome to the main question.   - I am sure you will agree with me that the only standard to take-is that each Ally should render that service whioh, upon a consideration of the needs of the Alliance as a whole, is of the greatest -use to the oommon cause. . Unfortunately, owing to her proximity to Germany, and to ,the oocupa-tion of a large part of her industrialised territory by the enemy -and still more owing to the faot that, as compared with Great Britain she is an-agricultural rather than a maritime and manufacturing country, France has had to bear a military burden which has been exceptionally great.     The fortitude&quot; and self-sacrifice with which she has shouldered that burden is the admiration of the whole world. I only wish that it wore- possible h aqualisa the sacrifice in these respects between our two countries.   If you had ooal mines, .or un-used industrial establishments, cr unemployed shipping resources, it would ha possible for us to send more men to the army while you under-took the services for the Alliance in these respects.   Unfortunately this is not possible.I oannot believe that it would serve our cause for Great Britain to cut dov/n her &amp;oal output,    to reduceher
Tior munitions programme, to diminish her agricultural production, and to disorganise not only her internal transportation system but tho shipping services of tho Allies in order to maintain some tens of thousands more men in the fighting lino,-   In particular &apos; I am certain that it would be fatal to cut down the arrangements, immonsQ and costly in men as they are, by which wo wore enabled to defeat the great Gorman submarine offensive- of 191V which if it had succeeded, would have brought tho whole Entente tumbling to the ground, and which though now kept within bounds, is still one of the ohief and most dangerous methods of German attack,   Yut if we were to make any further comb-out of our industries, that would be the inevitable effect.   For tho past two years we have-steadily been taking men out of industry,   Under &quot;pressure of a German offensive in March last we made so drastic a &quot;comb-out&quot; that even the industries essential to the prosecution of the war have had their supply of labour cut down to the bone, and we have been already compelled under pressure from; our Allies as well as our own Departments to return a certain number of those men from the army to industry.   The only way in which wo can liberate more workers as recruit is if you and our other Allies can dis-ponse with the shipping, the coal, the steel, and the other supplies which are sent you at the present time. :Finally I would point out that the proposal to tako more-men out of industry and transportation In this country is un-sound from tho purely military point of view.   Today the reserves of tho Allies army are in America.   If we wait for the United States to manufacture in America the equipment, the guns,.and tho munitions required by these reserves and the shipping in which they are to be transported, the British and French armies will be worn down before the- American army can reach Europe in sufficient numbers to enable the Allies to take the offensive in decisive strength.   Obviously the right course is for the French and British industries which are .already in full working order to supply tho American deficiencies in material and transportation so as to enable tho American army to come into action with its Allied colleagues at&apos; the earliest possible moment,   I would givo you one instance of what 1 mean.   It is not possible to transport tho American army to France without the use of European coal and European built ships.   It is certainly not good policy.from tho point of view of tho Alliance as a whole that large trained forces should be kept idle in the United states through want of coal- or ships, becauso we have taken a few thousand miners or shipwrights for service in the line.    I have not,, therefore, the slightest doubt that it is the right policy that the people of this country and also of Franco, while doing their utmost to maintain the maximum number of divisions possible in the field, should regard it as a not less essential&apos;part of their policy to keep up the production of those supplies which are indispensable to offensive-equipment of their own armies, to the power of endurance of their own nations, and to the equipment and transportation of the American army to France..During the last few weeks the British ..ar Cabinet and the Prime Ministers of the Dominions have made a careful examination of the man-power resources of the British Umpire, of Colonel Rourers report and of other investigations which they have had made into the problem under discussion. . They have reluctantly come to the conclusion that if the British iimpire is to be able to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour until victory has been achieved, as it has every intention of doing, it cannot call up anything like :tho same number of recruits in 1919 as it called up in 1918.   In their judgment,, and on this point they alone can speak with authority, the number of men engaged,in essential industries, since the drastic comb-out of this Summer, is at tho lowest limit compatible with the rendering by the British Empire of its maximum service to the Allied cause.   The recruits,the re-fore
therefore, which can be raised for the maintenance of the British Serviced,  (but excluding the Dominion divisions) during 1919.. will only be such portion of the annual class as is fit for cilit&amp;v? service and a further small comb-out made possible by the return to industry of disabled soldiers discharged from the army.     They have also been informed by the Prime Minister of Australia that there is&quot;likely to be a shortage of drafts necessary to maintain the whole of the Australian divisions in the field next year,&apos;    It is not,easy at this stage to estimate exactly what the number available for the British fighting services will be.     But, so far as they can ascertain, it will be about 300,000 men as against 700,000 raised in the exceptional circumstances of 1918.     From this number provision must be made for tile demands of the British Navy and for the. manning of the greatly increased numbers of tanks and aeroplanes,,     These three demands will probably absorb at least half this quota of new recruits. The extent to which this reduction in the number of recruits should involve a reduction in the number of British divisions on the Western front, or a reduction in the strength of the existing divisions is a question of policy upon which we shall greatly value the advice of Marshal Poch.I have thought it best to communicate to you at once the conclusions which we have reached in regard to the supply of infantry to the British Army next year. It raises large issues of policy, among others those connected with shipping which I am anxious to discuss with you as soon as the military situation is suffi-ciently clear to enable the Supreme War Council to con-sider the policy.for this.winter and next year *     I am, therefore, asking Lord Heading who is going to Paris to investigate the shipping position, to convey this letter to you to discuss with you&quot;its contents.With cordial felicitations on recent events in France.Ever Sincerely,&apos;(signed) P. LLOlTO GEORGE.
