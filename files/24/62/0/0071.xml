ACTION TAKEN.Inter-Allied Food Control.A conference between the Committee of Representatives and the Allied Maritime Transport Council was held on the 23rd inst. to discuss the provisional programme of importation for the cereal year 1918-1919.After some discussion, the conference was adjourned in order that the Allied Maritime Transport Council might formally consider the programme at a meeting which has been arranged to take place this week.(1) The Voluntary Kitchens (Licensing) Order, 1918, dated 19tli August, 1918, provides that no article of food may be sold or supplied in any voluntary kitcfien on or after 16th September, except under licence. A voluntary kitchen is defined as premises in which the main business is the sale or supply of food, otherwise than for gain. The Order revokes the Canteens and Hostels (Licensing) Order, 1918. It does not apply to huts, hostels, canteens, and buffets established by or with the assistance of a Government Department, or provided by an employer for his own employees. It does not extend to Ireland.(2) The Maize Products (Retail Prices) Order, 1918, dated 21st August, 1918, revises the maximum retail prices for maize flour, maize flake, maize semolina, hominy, cerealine, or maize meal. After September 1st the maximum price for those articles throughout the United Kingdom will be 4d!. per lb. The Order applies to proprietary brands.(3) The Margarine Cheese (Returns) Order, 1918, dated 21st August, 1918, requires the occupier of every factory or workshop engaged in the manufacture of margarine cheese to make such returns as may be required, showing the quantity manufactured, the persons to whom such cheese was consigned, the terms and conditions of sale, the stocks on hand, and the cost of manufacture.(4) The Potatoes (1918 Crop) (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated 22nd August, 1918, prohibits, except under licence, the buying or sale of any potatoes of the 1918 crop grown in Great Britain otherwise than for delivery before 1st November, 1918. The Order does not apply to the first early varieties.(5) The Blackberries Order, 1918, dated 23rd August, 1918, prohibits the use. of blackberries except for purposes of food, and fixes the following maximum prices : On sales to a jam manufacturer, ^\d. per lb. (421. per ton), and on sales by retail, id. per lb. The object is to secure the largest possible quantity for jam, and at the same time to allow picked fruit to be consumed in localities where transport facilities are not readily available. The Order does not apply to sales or purchases in Ireland for use or consumption in Ireland.(6) The Damson (Sales) Order, 1918, dated 23rd August, 1918, restricts the growers&apos; prices of damsons to 401 per ton, as from August 28th. The provisions of the Plum (Sales) Order, 1918, shall apply to damsons, the object being to utilise the damson crop for jam.Bacon, Ham, and Lard.-It is still necessary to export American bacon to Ireland, and it is at present uncertain when Ireland will again be able to meet its own requirements.Coffee. The Admiralty Marshal put 3,000 bags of coffee up for sale, which were eagerly taken. At the suggestion of the Ministry of Food he has agreed to increase the quantity to be put up for sale during the next few weeks.a  (33)6275-6   ?k 1   135  8/18  E&amp;S AOrders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.Supplies and Prices.
Dairy Products. In view of the increasing pressure of work in connection with the development of inter-Allied organisation and the need for consideration of post-war policy in regard to meat and oil-seeds, the Food Controller has decided to set up a new division for dealing with dairy products, namely, milk, butter, and cheese. ; - The winter prices of milk are still under consideration by the Agricultural Advisory Council and the Consumers&apos; Council, and no agreement has at present been reached.Meat.-Mr. Clynes presided at a meeting of the Consumers&apos; Council on Wednes-day, August 28, when Mr. Hyndman moved the following resolution: &quot; That this Council strongly protests against any rise in the price of meat at the present time, and suggests that the Treasury should bear the cost of maintaining the existing price of meat for the coming twelve months, and not to put an extra twopence per pound on the price of meat to the community.&quot;In favour of the resolution it was urged that the general pressure of prices and shortage of necessaries, especially of coal and milk, would produce a serious state of things in the coming winter; and that, if prices rose, wages would be forced up in still greater proportion, so that the loss to the Treasury would be greater, apart from the general disturbance created.Two of the Co-operative members supported the resolution, whereupon the Chairman asked if it was to be understood that Co-operators generally favoured subsidies. The answer was that these members merely expressed their personal views.The Chairman explained that the advance was necessary in order to secure the solvency of the live stock fund, and that it had only been deferred until it could be made to coincide with an improvement in the quality of meat.After some discussion the resolution was carried by 10 votes to 6.There has been a noticeable improvement in the quality of imported meat placed on the market recently, although some loss of condition was caused by delay in transit during the unusually warm weather last week.There is still some difficulty in equalising the distribution of home-killed meat over the principal industrial districts, hut there are considerably fewer complaints, and the extension of control in the immediate future to the sale of pigs and veal will complete the system under which all classes of meat are brought within the regulations of the ration.Owing to the demands made by the harvest upon labour, the quantities of live stock going forward to the markets fall short of the estimates; and it has there-fore been necessary to draw on the stocks of imported meat to a larger degree than was anticipated. Although total consumption continues to be considerably below the full ration permitted, the situation is not altogether free from anxiety.Ships&apos; Stores. As a result of supervision of the discharge of food-stuffs at docks during the last three months, over 1,000 tons of poultry food have been salved from ships, through sweeping out the holds, &amp;c. Several bags of pig and poultry food (unclaimed) have been passed on to the National Salvage Council.Attention has also been given to improved methods in the discharging of food-stuffs from vessels. Improvements have been made in &quot; elevators and bands,&quot; and also, as far as possible, the use of hooks is abolished. The introduction of save-alls, &amp;c, and supervision generally has resulted in an appreciable increase in the percentage of out-turn figures on bills of lading.   The average &quot; sweepings &quot; have been reduced.Organised Distribution.Rationing. It has been decided that the value of the meat coupon must be lowered from 22nd September to id. This arrangement, combined with the increase in the price of meat, will give a weekly ration of butchers1 meat (including pork) of 15 ozs.   Bacon and ham will still remain unrationed.It has been decided, in principle, that from 3rd of November, when the next issue of ration books will be made, jam, honey, and syrup will be rationed. The proposals at present under consideration include one for a supplementary ration to children between the ages of 6 and 18.Divisional Reports. Hitherto the Isle of Man has not been rationed^ but it is in the power of the Governor to adopt-at his discretion any orders issued by the
Ministry. The Commissioner for the N.-W. Division reports that the residents of the Island, who number 42,000, are for the most part unable to afford to purchase food in excess of the ration enforced on the mainland; but that visitors, who go to the Isle of Man in large numbers in the holiday season, are taking advantage of the lack of restrictions, to purchase excess, quantities of food, more especially of meat. In view of this, Lord Raglan, the Governor, has agreed to adopt the National Rationing Scheme, which will-be put in force on the island from the 3rd November next, the date fixed for the issue of the new ration books throughout the country.A scheme has been put forward in North Scotland for the consideration of the Ministry of Food, by Lord Leverhulme-who has recently purchased the Island of Lewis by which he proposes to utilize the large supplies of herrings caught there, for canning purposes. The proposal is to establish an experimental canning factory at Stornaway, with facilities in the first place for dealing with 100 tons of herrings a week, and it is suggested that if the experiment proved a success other factories might be set up for the same purpose, and an important industry be established in that part of Scotland, If the enterprise receives the support of the Government, every effort will be made to have the Stornaway factory ready for use by the beginning of the coming January, when the winters herring fishing begins.Enforcement of Orders.The number of prosecutions for the week is as follows : .Prosecutions.

The most noticeable fact is the sudden rise in the number under the Meat (Maximum Prices) Order from 30 last week to 154 this week ; this is accounted for by the large number of charges  amounting to 76 brought against one wholesale butcher at Stockport, of selling meat at excess prices.T. Backstrom, master of a foreign vessel sailing under Admiralty charter, was fined 501. at North Shields on the 19th August for contravening the Ships&apos; Stores Restriction Order by making a false declaration of stores remaining on board.
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.A heavy receipt of sugar was in the main responsible for a marked increase in imports of principal foods and feeding-stuffs during the week ended August 24th (Table A). Increases in cereals and decreases in meat and fats were also noticeable. The total, 168,700 tons, though not large, was only 20,600 tons lower than that of a year ago, whereas the previous four weeks showed an average deficiencv on 1917 of 113,900 tons.Wheat and flour together rose from 40,300 tons to 47,900 tons. In equivalent grain the increase amounted to 12,600 tons, but the quantity received represents little more than half a week&apos;s consumption. Other cereals, that is barley, oats, maize, and rice, all improved. Maize and barley showed the largest increases, the former rising from 2,700 tons to 8,000 tons, the latter from 2,700 tons to 6,300 tons. As compared with the week ending August 25th, 1917, the total for all cereals (including wheat) was 33,500 tons&apos; lower.Consignments of bacon and hams were again smaller ; not since the week ended March 2nd has the import been so low. Butchers&apos; meat also declined and at 8,100 tons in all was 8,000 tons less than a year ago.The quantity of cheese imported, 1.100 tons, was little more than a quarter of that in the previous week, but only slightly below that of the corresponding week in 1917. The decrease, in lard on the week before was about the same as in cheese, and was only in part offset by an increase in butter from 200 tons to 700 tons. Butter is not arriving in sufficient quantities to compensate for the weeks when it was virtually absent from the list of imports. Condensed milk improved, but was below an average weeFs import.Sugar rose from. 26,200 tons to 54,500 tons, a figure that has not been equalled since the beginning of April, and tea from 2,600 tons to 4,600 tons. There was some improvement in coffee, but cocoa fell away to well below average.Consumption.Meat. The following table shows the estimated weekly consumption by civilians of butchers&apos; meat, home and foreign, in Great Britain during the past three months : 	Average Weekly Consumption.			Home.

(Table C).Bread and Flour. The consumption of bread and flour in the United Kingdom as shown by returns of bakers and retailers of flour for the four weeks to August 17th was in the aggregate 2 per cent, greater than in the previous four weeks and 9 per cent, greater than in the corresponding four weeks of 1917 (Table E). Last year there was a fall of 2 per cent, from July to August. *Table J shows the movement in different parts of the country. The August figures are influenced by Bank Holiday week and holiday migrations. This is illustrated in the table by the fall in London and increases in areas containing large summer resorts. Both in Scotland and Ireland the average percentage increase on July is greater than in England.
The 1917 crop oi potatoes is now practically exhausted. The table below shows the extent to which they have been utilised by bakers making returns : 	Four weeks ended									Jan. 5th.	Feb. 2nd.

The propor-tion of bakers putting potatoes in the loaf was at no time great; with a rise in the total quantity of potatoes from 172 tons in December to 927 tons in June, the flour used with potatoes rose from 7,500 tons in the earlier month to 35,000 tons in the later month, the amount used per ton of flour declining steadily since March.Fish. - Arrivals of fish at Billingsgate Market during the week ending August 24th were 2,443 tons, a slight decrease on the figures for the previous week and a year ago. Returns from provincial markets for the week ended August 17th show in general increases on those of the week before, which were exceptionally low.Stocks.As shown in the accompanying table, the total estimated stocks of principal cereals in the United Kingdom have been falling rapidly since the commencement of the month : Commodity.

Rice continues high and approximately neutralises the low level of other diluent grains.Stocks of meat and provisions underwent several important changes from the 1st to the 17th August. By the latter date butchers&apos; and preserved meat had fallen from 92,200 tons to 85,500 tons, or 6,700 tons ; bacon and hams had risen to 82,200 tons, fish to 30,200 tons, and cheese to 24,200 tons; butter had fallen, by reason of the long delayed effect of small imports, 4,000 tons to 18,700 tons.
