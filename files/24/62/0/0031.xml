W. 1. 27th August,  1918.Dear Hankey,I haye just received the enclosed papers, and, as Pay is away in prance, I am sending them to you at once.   I was not present myself at the discussion which led up to the resolution now submitted &quot;by the Inter-Allied Transportation Council, but I am informed by Young, who was present on my behalf, and in whom I have every confidence, that the opinion expressed in the resolution to the effect that the railway position in Prance is very much more serious than it was a month ago, is true, and that there is no suggestion whatever of bluff in the resolution.     The position inregard to transportation for the American army in prance is obviously of great gravity.Young informs me that during last week only 37^ of the American demands for wagons were .actually met, and he has informed me that he is satisfied that there is more-traffic offering on French railways at the present moment than,they are&apos; capable.of handling, and every part of the machine is subjected to undue strain,I recently wrote a paper on the wagon situation in France, which was circulated,  and one of the suggestions in that paper was that coal for Italy should be transported by sea, to the relief of railway transportation on the Continent.   You will remember that the Shipping Controller pronounced that the measure proposed was impossible,.Doubtless the matter will how again be considered by the Cabinet, and, in Fay1s absonce, I am just going with General Mance to show these papers to the Shipping Con-troller, so that he will be at once put in possession of the situation, and be prepared for further communication from you,I am,Yours sincerely,(Sd.) P.A.M.. NASH. I propose to return to France tomorrow.Lieut-Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey, K.C.B., Offices of the War Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.

R.*.*   M   frH   If W IW i* M k*I enclosure three copies of a resolution which was passed &quot;by the Inter-Allied Transportation Council at their, meeting of the 23rd instant.   This resolution has &quot;been adopted by Monsieur CLAVBILLE,. Minister of Public Works, who, as you are aware, is new responsible for both military and civil railway transportation in FRANCE,The subject of this note - the immediate relief of the French Railways by. the greater use of sea transport of coal to ITALY - is a matter of such paramount importance at the present time that tho Council unanimously agreed that the resolution should be submitted by each Representative to the Representative of his Country on the Supreme War Council, I have to request, therefore, that, a copy of this note may be forwarded at once to Lieut-Col., Sir Maurice Hankey for the consideration M&quot; the British Representative,As a.previous attempt to obtain relief for French Railways by the increased use of sea routes for coal trans-port was unsuccessful,, you will understand that the Council have only decided to reopen the question because they are convinced that the position is so serious that some relief has now become an absolute necessity.    I trust therefore that in forwarding the note you will urge that the British Representative should accept it in principle before the 28th August, when the Inter-Allied Committees interested in the question af Maritime Transport are, we are informed, to meet,(Sgd,) P. C. YOUNG.Colonelfor British Representative Inter-Allied Transportation Council.PARIS24th August, 1918.Copy to       British Military RepresentativeBritish SectionSupreme ,ar Council.Colonel Le Honaff.ENCLOSURE II TO GENERAL NASH&apos;S LETTER OF 27,.8,18,:COLLECTIVE NOTE OF THE INTER-ALLIED TRANSPORTATION COUBCI ADOPTED AT THEIR MILTING OF THE 23rd AUGUST, 1918,The coal requirements of ITALY make it absolutely necessary that there should be delivered 600,000 tons every month to that country either by rail or.by sea.Furthermore
Furthermore the movement of a part of this coal by the French railroads now imposes upon than a burden which it is impassible for them to carry.A superior military necessity requires that the French railroads release the maximum number of cars possible in order to provide thorn for essential military transportation and especially for the traffic of the American Expeditionary Force.After a complete discussion of the subject, and. after having taken into consideration the different interests to be considered, the Inter-Allied Transportation Council unanimously proposes the following distribution of coal shipments(1)   Directly by sea from ENGLAND (2)   From French mines :(a) Entirely by rail through KODANE and VIHTI11ILLE(b) By rail to the French ports of LA HCUVTXLE,  CEiTE, POHT-DE-IOUG and ST. LOUIS DU HFOHS, and forwarded to ITALY   by coasting vesselsTotal-250,000 tons monthly150,000 tons monthly100,000 tons monthly GOO,pop tons monthlyIt is understood that the present arrangements for moving coal to ITALY must not be changed until the new programme is in course of execution.It is the considered opinion of the Council that unless the measure of relief which they have proposed above is immediately forthcoming, it will be impossible for the French-railways to provide transport to meet the essential needs of the Allied Armies operating in FRANCE, and that consequently a diminution of the military effort will become inevitable.While the Inter-Allied Transportation Council only now asks this partial measure of relief, it must be recognised that it may not be sufficient in the event of the military situation requiring intensive movement during a prolonged period, and that in such an event it may be necessary,to request that all the coal forwarded to ITALY by rail be transported by sea.
