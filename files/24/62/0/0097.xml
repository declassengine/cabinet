I ciroulate herewith for the consideration of the War Cabinet a memorandum by the Coal Controller regarding the release of Ooal Miners from the Anay.September 3rd,1918,it3x$)With reference to the report of the meeting on 2nd September-frith regard to the machines lor returning men from the forces to the Cine a, the Ooal Controller has to remark as followsthat,The present scheme for the demobilisation of 25,000 &quot;Bl&quot;, &quot;B2&quot;. and &quot;B3&quot;, man serving at home, is so arranged tl with the aid of the muster Parades to tfke place on September 7th, the names of the men and of their pits can be advised to the Controller of Coal Mines by September 9th and by the Controller of Coal Mines to the&apos;War Office Department at Kew by September 2mf    The Department at Kew have stated that with their present machinery they cannot deal with an output of more than 3,000?en per week, so that the balance - now 13,000 and perhaps 0,000 on the 21st September * will require another three or four weeks before all these men get back to work in the Mines,With regard to the 25,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men applied for, whila the Controller of Coal Mines is prepared to accept &quot;Bl&quot; men an equivalent to Category wmi&amp;x lining work, if all these men are to be obtained from Prance on the score that justice requires men who have served a long time in the Army, to have, a preference in demobilisation over men recently recruited, it is obvious that the time occupied in making these men available for work in the Mines, must necessitate the expiry of several months before yielding any substantial results.    If, however, the same machinery as is now being spplied to the low Categories in the Home Camps, was also applied to Category &quot;A&quot; men at home provided an immediate start is made, it is quite conoeivable that these men might be available for work in the Mines in the 1 latter part of October, but if only men &apos;now in Prance are to be 1 released, it is understood that no flow of these could start for at least two months, and no appreciable effect, in the output of coal could be anticipated before the end of the year.The Controller of Coal Mines feels it necessary to point out that the present position of Coal supplies in this Country does not admit of such delay, unless a drastic system of rationing coal for the industries is at once put into force.
The loss of output during the four months from April to July of this year, when recruiting and the influenza epidemic had&apos;the higjiost effect, was nearly 8f million tens, at a time too when instead of losing tonnage we ought to have boen building up stocks for Win-ter consumption,mayiWliile the out put /jfco some extent be improved by an extra effort on tho part of the men now employed in the mines the full loss can&apos;only be mads good by mcrecsin^ the force of labour in the mines at once otherwise tM&apos; effects of the shortage will be felt among all classes of consumers by Hove moor next*To sum up. oither the 50.000 minors of Catogorios &quot;A&quot;  nmn. &apos;1B2\ aai UB3&quot;, must all be returned to the Minos by the end of October, or immediate stops must be takon for the adoption oi the policy of Industrial rationing which was sanctioned at tho War Cabinet Meeting, 417, 24/5/18.
