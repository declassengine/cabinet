The process&quot; of inventing new local medals, once started, may. go on indefinitely and the squabbling over it, - as, for instance, whether an operation was ^successful&quot; or &quot;unsuccessful&quot;, on which point I think Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s contention unanswerable - will be bitter and endless.Our only chance of peace and comparative fairness is to     stick to the idea of a Dominion Staff - as nearly ae possible analagous to the 1914 Star - to celebrate the first entry of Dominion Troops into tho war, leaving it to each Dominion to settle for itself the unit of time to be assigned to the decoration for its own troops.Particular operations - Galliooii, Baghdad, Ypres -wherever it is thought desirable, can still be commemorated -and it is the only right way - by a clasp on the-International Medal, which would, of course, be given to all the troops, whether British, Dominion or Indian, who took part in them.ft).8.IB.
(This document is the property of His Britannic llajesty^Governme nt).-VAR   CABINET. GALLIPOLI   DECORATIONS.Copy of letter from Mr, Austen Chamberlain to the Adjutant General, War Office, dated 15th August, 1918,My Dear General, fII have no criticism on the wording of your Memo,   g But the more I think of it, the less I like the prospect.If you could say that following the precedent of  1 the issue of the 1914 Star to British and Indian troops, His liajesty had approved the issue of a star to each of the Dominion Contingents which first represented that Dominion in any theatre of operations in the Great War, I think your position would be tenable;   but if you have to name three Dominions,only and in connection with them to specify Gallinoli, I fear there will be trouble.   In other words either you must give a time medal without distinction of theatre of war (but with the time varying .with the time of entry into the war of the Dominion) as in the case of the 1914 Star or you must give a locality medal.   If you mention Gallipoli, all Gallipoli up to that date must have it.   I do not think&quot;&quot;you can escape from this necessity,I think the distinction between successful and unsuccessful operations is difficult to make,    &apos;Mons&apos; was a retreat.   Was it therefore to be classed as a failure? Will you give a decoration to troops who marched into Baghdad and not to those who fought as gallantly under far greater disabilities in the earlier stages of that oampai&amp;n?But this is a digression.   My present point is that the draft Army Order does not put the Anzao Star on the same level as the 1914 Star,   Unless you can alter it so as to bring the two into line, I fear there will be continued trouble.Yours very truly,(Sgd.) Austen Chamberlain.
(This document ia the property of His Britannic Majesty*sGovernment).Secret,G.T.PRS8.MEMORANDUM BY THE ARMY COUNCIL ON THE SUBJECT OFMr, A* CHAMBERLAIN&apos;S IJMORANDUM NO.G.T.6348.It would seem that the Memorandum by Mr. A.Chamberlain has been written under a misapprehension, and possibly because the circumstances and conditions under which a decoration is about to be issued to certain Dominion troops have not been given sufficient publicity.   PerhapB it will be best to give  . a short account of the course of the negotiations which have led up to the present situation..Some two years ago it was decided, in order to avoid a multiplicity of war medals between the Allies, to approach the Allied Governments in regard to the issue of an Internal tional medal which would be common to all the Allies, but would be issued in each country under such conditions as might be laid down by the respective Governments;   the ribbon to be identical, and the medal practically so.The proposal whioh holds good at the present tine in regard to the issue of the International Medal to British troops (including the Dominions, India and the Colonies) is that it shall he issued to all commissioned officers and attested men who have landed in a theatre of war by a certain date to be determined later.   It is also proposed that the International Medal shall bear clasps commemorative of battles and localities, the description and number of such clasps to be determined by a Special Committee consisting of representatives from all the great theatres of war and from the Admiralty.   Such Committee will of course not be able to commence its labours until after peace has been declared^In addition to the International medal it is proposed to issue a British medal for all officers and enlisted personnel in Great Britain, the Dominions., India and the Colonies,   Thus a man 7/ho has enlisted in the Army who for one reason or another did not leave the British Isles, or if an Indian soldier did not leave India, Trill be entitled to the British medal only, whereas a man who served in a theatre of war will be entitled to the International nedal with ouch clasps as ho may have earned, together with the British medal.The question of the possibility of granting a sap-arata medal for each theatre of war was considered and was not found practicable.. The result v/ould be that some soldiers would be entitled to 4 or P medals who had spent much time in travelling between theatres of war, whereas the soldier who had been fighting continuously in one theatre would only be in possession of one medal.Owing to popular pressure it was decided in November 1917, to grant a distinctive decoration to recognise the services rendered by His Majesty \a Military Forces under thecommand
2.Ouiraand of Field Marshal Sir John French in France and Belgium during the earlier phase of the war in 1914 up to midnight November 22/23rd, 1914.It is calculated that about 400;000 persons will participate in this decoration, of which about half are regular soldiers, about 50,000 Indian soldiers, and the remainder Special Reserve, Territorials and other personnel, such as Nursing Sisters, Hospital employees, etc.,At the Imperial War Conference of 1917, the question was raised by the representatives of Australia and New Zealand of the grant of a decoration for Australia and New Zealand troops who served at Gallipoli..   No very definite result was arrived at, but during the &quot;latter part of 1917 and the beginning of 1918, correspondence was carried on between the Colonial Office and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, resulting in a decision that a decoration should be given by the Governments of those Dominions to Australian and New Zealand soldiers who served in Gallipoli,   The matter was referred to the War Office, who while not approving of the proposal, considered it v/as a matter largely poJ.itical, to be dealt with by the Colonial Office,   After further correspondence the War Office approved of the proposal, but made a suggestion that the conditions of the decoration should be limited to &quot;time&quot; and not to &quot;locality&quot;.   The matter came    before the Imperial War Conference in June and July, 1918, when the Governments of Australia and New Zealand advanced the claim for an Imperial decoration for all troops who had served in Gallipoli.   They were afterwards joined by the Government of Newfoundland.Mr. Hughes and Mr, Massey urged the claim on the grounds that it would be a mark of the &quot;birth of a nation&quot;, and would be a symbol of the entry of the Dominions for the first time into a great European war on behalf of the Empire.   The War Office view thoroughout has been that it would be quite impossible to give any decoration to British troops for the operations in Gallipoli, beyond possibly a clasp on the International medal.   To do so would be to go back on the time-honoured policy that decorations are given only for successful operations, and in the opinion of the Amy Council such step would tend to cheapen military decorations in the eyes of serving and future soldiers.During the last discussion of the subject at the Imperial War Conference the   representative of Canada said that he had no wish for a special decoration, that what v/ao good enough for the bulk of the British Foroee was good enough for the Canadians.   The view of the South African representative was, it is understood-1,&apos; similar.The Secretary of State for India during the discussion claimed consideration for Indian troops engaged at Gal.J.:tpoli, but it was pointed   out by the Army Council representative that Indian troops had already participated in tho 1914 Star to the number of some 50,000.The Army Council raised no objection to the proposal of a decoration to be given with the approval of His Majesty, and under the authority of the British War Office, to the troops of such Dominions as wished for it, on condition that the  -rant should be limited in a measure analogous to that of the &quot;1914 Star&quot; to&quot;the&apos;krritish Forces - i.e,, that the decoration should not be granted broadcast, but only under certain set conditions; also that the Dominions concernedshould
IV 943kshould themselves lay down the conditions under which the decoration would he bestowed ur)on their own troops. As a result it is proposed in the immediate future to isvuo an Army Order drafted as follows;-&quot;Australian, New Zealand and Newfoundland Expeditionary Forces 191F - Grant of Special Star,&quot;1.   His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of a distinctive decoration to recognise the services rendered by the Australian, Now Zealand, and Newfoundland Military Forces in 191F. 3&quot;2,   The decoration will be a Star in bronze.&quot;3,   No clasp will be issued with the Star,&quot;4,   The Star will have a distinctive riband to be selected by the Government of the Dominion concerned,&quot;5.   This Star will, at tho request of the Dominion Governments concerned, be granted to all Dominion Officers and soldiers of the Australian, New Zealand and Newfoundland Military Forces who actually served with an Expeditionary Force provided that they landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula prior to midnight 20th/21st December 1915.i&quot;6,   The award of this decoration will bo confined    j to those mentioned in tho preceding paragraph,&quot;7.   Instructions as to the submission of claims, the production and disnosal of the Stars and ribands will be published by tho respective Dominion Governments in due course&apos;]The Army Council are fully aware that much criticism I will be levelled at this proposal of the Dominion Governments, j and that pressure will be urged to viden the scope of the decoration and to include British troops, but they are strongly of opinion that tho grounds on which it is proposed to issue the decoration arc defensible in that, it i3 intended to be merely a token,to such Dominions as wish to avail thornselves of it, of the entry of Dominion troops into the   Great War*In the event of Canada wishing to participate in the decoration the conditions v/ill no doubt bo limited to the , first Canadian Contingent that called for France, and in the same way South Africa might latci on ask for the decoration&apos; for her troops who fought -ither in Gorman South West Africa, or for the original South African Brigade that sailed for France.It may be advisable to issue a short statement to the Press explaining that this decoration is in no way intended as a reward for service in Gallipoli, but is merely given to such Dominions as desire It to be issued to their troops under such conditions as they may lay down,15.3.10.-
