A comparison of the numbers shown under IV. for the 8 months does net therefore give an accurate criterion of the vessels in Allied service at the different periods.&quot;Requisition&quot; is here used to mean &quot;requisition for full Government service.&quot;  The vessels shown as &quot;free from requisition &quot; therefore include the vessels that are requisitioned under the special liner requisitioning scheme : t SPECIAL LINER REQUISITIONING SCHEME :-All liner trades are now requisitioned under special conditions, which, while leaving the vessels still under the manage-ment of their owners, and free so far as circumstances permit to accept private as well as Government cargo, secure that the vessels are operated on Government account, the owners being paid on a Blue Book basis.tj- Includes 26 vessels (65,736 G.T.) transferred from Norwegian flag under the Norwegian Agreement.
