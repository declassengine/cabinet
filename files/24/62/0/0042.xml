I circulate, for the consideration of the War Cabinet,. a Memorandum which has been prepared for me by tlio Goal Controller, regarding the release of Grade One miners from-the Army.A JL Stanley,Board of Trade.29th August, 1918.0U &apos; HfflilAa^In connection with the pending application before the War Cabinet for tho release of 25,000 Grade One coal miners from the Army, I think it right to indicate how in my opinion this release should take place (if the War Cabinet decide to order it) and from what source the men should come.The recruitment during this year of 75,000 grade one coal miners inearly completed) has taken place in two instal-meats (1) 50,000, ouickly followed by (2) 25,000 men.    I think that it is the last instalment of 25,000 men who should be returned for the following reasons(a) Their military training is loss advanced than that of any others.(b) They are in the main older than the earlier instalment being largely between 25 and 32. while the first instal-raent were largely between 18 and 25.(c) They should be more easily traced, having been more recently posted.(d) As the simplest method of ensuring an equal return to each pit.As to tho method.    The Recruitment of the 75 000 has been delegated by the Ministry of National Service to tneir regional officers working in close touch with the local miners Associations who in almost every case adopted tho practice of selecting the men by ballot after a preliminary discrimination by local pit committees on personal and family grounds.   Ballot lists were prewired separately it is understood, for the earlier 50,000 and&quot;the later 25,000, and these lists were furnished by the colliery firms and companies and for the minors&apos; pit committees to the looal officers for the Ministry of National Service. The men were called up according to seniority on these lists, and where there was no ballot, they were usually called up by age groups.The local officers of the Ministry of National Service presumably have the lists of men called up to form the 25,000 and these lists show who should be returned.    My Department has not received these lists, and has not had occasion to do so.
It is understood that the procedure has been for the Ministry of National Service rogional officers after call-iog the men up, to hand thorn over to the Army, the Navy * &quot;or the Air Fores (as the case may be) to bo posted by those services to this or that unit, and oresumably the Ministry   . of National Service have no record as to the unit and camp or dop&amp;t controlled by these services to which the men are eventually posted, much less have I any record.It seams therefore that, should it be decided to return 25,000 grade one men, the War Oabinet should issue instructions.(1)   to the Ministry of National Sorvice at once to supply the throe servjpe3 mentioned with the names of the men in tne last 25,000 handod over to them.(2)   to the Army, the Navy or the Air Force at once to trace these men so named and return thorn to their Collieries by the 30th September 1918, oither by way of transfer to Army Reserve &quot;W&quot; or to the general reserve to which every civilian male of military age is deemed to belong.(3)   to the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to make it perfectly clear to such men tnat the V,&apos;ar Oabinet have deciied that it is in the National interest that they should return to their collieries;   and, in so far as any men may absolutely decline in a written statement to return \(4)   to tho Ministry of National Service to meet   &apos; any deficit so oausod by repeating tho process in (1) above, with rojard to the necessary quota to be made up out of the earlier 50,000. care always being taken to ensure that each colliery receives it3 proper quota.
