These come in two classes of convoy - the fast convoy which sails direct from New York, and the slower convoy - which is a combined Canadian and American troop convoy - which has hitherto sailed from Halifax, the American&quot;troops going from New York to Halifax up the coast. .Owing to representations from Washington in consequence of the greater submarine activities on the American Seaboard? that this coastal journey from New York to Halifax was undesir-able, it was arranged that Halifax should be abandoned as the assembly port for the Convoy, and that the ships loading in American Ports should collect at New York and those in the-St, Lawrence at Sydney, Cape Breton, and the two portions sail inde-pendently to the rendezvous about 500 miles from the coast wherethey join up and form one convoy.      The Canadian portion by this plan is obliged to oass through waters which the Admiralty do not consider the safest from the submarine point of view.while, on the other hand, by sailing the convoy as a whole from the St; Laurence the great advantage of having a-&quot; alternative route to the open sea either North or South of Newfoundland is obtained.It was believed - although apparently erroneously ^ that the United States Authorities had&quot;concurred in this course, which entailed railing their troops for conveyance by this convoy to Montreal and Quebec for embarkation        The United States Naval Authorities and the British Naval Authorities are all in favour of the change, and the ships have been diverted to the St. Lawrence for the puroose, the tramo steamers hitherto trading from the St. Lawrence&quot;having been removed to take the place of the transports at the American ports,, It now transDires that the American War Department refuses to send the full number of troops to Montreal and Quebec for embarkation in the ships which have thus been transferred and which we How learn definitely were transferred without their acquiescence from the Military point of view.      Various reasons have been given by the War Department.      The first was that there were&quot;no concentration camps at Montreal and Quebec. The second was that they had made depots at American Atlantic ports for the equipment of their troops and it would mean removing them from those ports up to Montreal        The third reason was that as the alternative route can only be used for a short time owing to ice, it would not be worthvliile to send stores etc, to the concentration camps which they again say do not exist, although this is not in accordance with the facts given by the Canadian Government.
Lord Reading&apos; is fully cognisant of the question, and collaborated in the compilation or a telegram to Mr. Barclay for transmission to the President,      Mr Barclay, however, wires to-*day that the War Department have taken such a very strong line that he thinks it would be fruitless to refer it to the President,We are therefore faced with this situation.      mhat the American Naval Authorities and British Naval Authorities have concurred that a certain course is desirable in the interests of the safety of the troops.      The British Naval Authorities and the Ministry of Shipping - it must be confessed without the full consent of the American Military Authorities - took stetjs to give effect to that course.      The Military Authorities decline to adopt it. and if they insist upon this refusal an inevitable loss of 30.000 to 40,000 men conveyed across the Atlantic will be involved before we can re-arrange the shipping and revtrt to the old scheme which is considered undesirable for the reasons given above,      Our information privately from the States is that the Military Authorities are not averse to this reason for a falling off in the ship-ments of troops.The view of the War Cabinet is desired as to how this Situation should be dealt with.(Signed)    ERIC GSDDES,
