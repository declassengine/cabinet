Industrial Unrest. ?There are a number of cases of serious dispute attracting attention. Of these the moat important was the trouble in the Yorkshire coal mines, which came to a head during the week and resulted in a strike on the 22nd instant-affecting over 100,000 men. The dispute aro.se from the award issued by Judge Benson on the 8th June, dealing with the subject of working hours of surface men. It provided for a fifty-four hours week, and the question in dispute is whether those fifty-four hours are intended to include or to exclude meal-times. It appears that the interpretation of the mine-owners, namely, that the award was intended to exclude meal-times, was accepted by the surface men as a whole. The Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, however, of which Mr. Herbert Smith is president, is at variance with &quot;the&apos; surface workers&apos; organisation, and contains among its members certain men who have left them and joined the association. On this ground the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association has some interest in the interpretation of the award, and its officials would seem to have used the opportunity to improve their position vis-a-vis the surface workers by interpreting the award to include meal-times.The dispute was first reported by the Coal Controller in his weekly report for the 23rd July. He referred the matter to the Arbitrator for an interpretation of the award,
and the decision of Judge Benson was in favour of the owners. The representatives of the men were given an opportunity, which they refused to take, of joining in the application to the Arbitrator for an interpretation of his award. Subsequent meetings between the mine-owners of West Yorkshire and of South Yorkshire, and the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, led to no settlement, and the men came out as described. They returned to work the following clay, a settlement having been reached, Judge Benson&apos;s award being set aside, and the matter referred to arbitration de novo.It is to be noted in connection - with this dispute that the men were generally averse to striking, and that the matter was, in fact, by no means so much a dispute between the mineowners and the men, as between the officials of the two unions con-cerned. There seems little doubt that the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association saw in the dispute an opportunity of weakening the position of the Surface Mens&apos; Union, and thought that if they attained success in this dispute it would probably induce existing surface men to see their advantage in joining the Miners&apos; Association.Apart from this there seems some reason to believe that Mr. Herbert Smith used the opportunity for demonstrating his personal importance. He is Vice-President of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and is said always to have been jealous of Mr. Smillie. It has also been suggested that he aspires to one of the two permanent posts recently created at the Miners&apos; Federation Conference at Southport.If these facts are as reported, the dispute is important as demonstrating the power which lies in the hands of officials, who may be unscrupulous, to cause serious trouble for personal or inadequate ends.There are other cases which demonstrate unrest at the present time. A serious dispute is in progress between the Co-operative Wholesale Society and its employees, who are members of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees. The Society finds it exceedingly difficult to arrange for uniform conditions among its employees, while men performing identical duties belong, at their option, to Craft Unions or to the A.U.C.E. This difficulty has been intensified owing to irregular advances in wages during the war, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society has now demanded that its employees shall join Unions ot the craft which they exercise. On the other hand the A.U.C.E. has always asserted the principle that all co-operative employees should join its ranks.There is trouble among the co-operative societies on other grounds, the most important-among them being a demand by the A.U.C.E. that all female employees who replace, or have replaced men, shall receive the same rate of pay and war bonus as the men they replace. On this ground a strike is threatened by the whole of the Leeds Branch of the A.U.C.E., and it is anticipated that Yorkshire generally will follow the example of Leeds.The seriousness of the position lies in the effect which any strike would have on the distribution of food, as members registered with the societies for meat, groceries, &amp;c, would be left entirely without supplies. They could not obtain them from other shopkeepers.The third centre of trouble lies in the Lancashire cotton district, where notices have been tendered to take effect from the 7th September, unless the Rota System is re-established.In South Wales there is an important agitation among the miners on the food question. Mr. Winstone, President of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, has wired to the Food Controller stating that drastic action on the part of the men is to be anticipated unless immediate arrangements are made for an adequate supply of meat, butter, jam, and cheese. It is believed that the supply of these commodities to South Wales is not in any way inferior to that of the country generally.From the above short description of immediately important troubles, it is clear that the industrial position contains several elements of anxiety.II. Press Comments.(A.) Foreign Politics.Russia.The Baku expedition is criticised generally. The &quot;Herald&quot; writes that it is &quot; one of those strangely frequent coincidences that the cause of liberty should summon us to occupy one of the richest areas in the world, in which London financiers have enormous
interests.&quot; &quot; Forward&quot; classes the expeditions to Archangel, Baku, and Vladivostok as undertaken in the interests of capitalism, and refers to the arrival of the commercial travellers at Baku.&quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; animadvert on the violation of Persian neutrality, which the latter compares with the invasion of Belgium by Germany in 1914.The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer&quot; analyses the reasons given by Mr. Lloyd George and by President Wilson for intervention in Russia, and concludes that the true aim though nominally to assist the Czecho-Slovaks, and in the redemption and restoration of Russia, is the downfall of the Bolshevik regime.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; also attacks the policy of intervention on somewhat similar grounds.The &quot; Herald &quot; prints an open letter to -Lenin of a laudatory type.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; considers the Russian news hopeful from the Bolshevik standpoint, the Soviet troops having won many victories, and the food shortage being mitigated by the gathering of the new harvest.France.References to French affairs are less frequent this week. &quot; The Call &quot; criticises &quot; France Libre&quot; on the ground of an article in which Presiient Wilson and Mr. Lloyd George are alleged to speak with the same tongue as the French Socialists on the subject of the league of nations. &quot; The Call &quot; laughs at the simplicity of the Socialism which makes such statements, it also attacks the same paper on. the score of its recommendation that the sentence on M. Malvy should be accepted without protest until after the war that the Union sacree may be maintained. This Union sacree it holds to be only another term for the servility of democracy to a reactionary Giovernment minority. In &quot;Forward&quot; Mr. Eamsay Macdonald describes M. Malvy&apos;s departure into exile, when the crowd showered flowers and greetings upon him and cried &quot; Vive la Republique ! &quot; He says that two officers and a porter retorted &quot; a has la Repiiblique ! &quot; and thereby displayed the enemy&apos;s true colours.America.&quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Clarion&quot; each print an article on the development of Socialism in America since the outbreak of war. These are contributed by Allan Benson, ex-Socialist candidate for the U.S. Presidency, who has followed the example of Mr. John Spar-go and left the American Socialist Party. He points out that the action of the American Government - in taking over certain key industries, and in annulling freedom of contract is progress towards Socialism and in the truest interests and methods of democracy.India.A considerable amount of attention is given to Indian affairs. In the &quot; Bradford Pioneer&quot; Dr. F. C. Conybeare anticipates that Japan, after proclaiming a protectorate over Lower Burma, the Malay Peninsula, Siam, Annam, Tonkin, and Ceylon, will join with Germany and the Mahommedan Powers to attack India from the north-west.The &quot; Call&quot; and the &quot; Herald &quot; have articles critical of the Montagu-Cheimsfbrd proposals, on the ground that they give only a semblance of power to the Indian Ministries which they would constitute.(B.) Home Politics.General Election.The &quot; Herald,&quot; in its chief leading article of the week, welcomes the early disso-lution of Parliament. Notwithstanding the tradition that a khaki election is always unfavourable to those who oppose the Government, in the present case the labour vote and the soldiers&apos; vote, both of which it hopes to find solid in favour of a negotiated peace, will suffice to defeat &quot;the advocate of the knock-out blow &quot; and &quot; the old gang.&quot; It concludes the article, &quot;for us the contest cannot come too soon.&quot;The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; has a non-committal article detailing the objections to an election during the war. It anticipates the possibility that the pacifist members would not be able to survive the combined opposition of all other parties, but thinks it not improbable that their members might even be increased.   It ends its article with the
remark that the I.L.P. are not in the least averse to a genera] election, but the whole tenour of the article tends to the opposite conclusion.Similarly the &quot;Leeds Citizen&quot; analyses the views expressed by the &quot;Central News &quot; and the &quot; Times,&quot; aud gives no indication of its own view as to the desirability of an election at the present time.On the other hand, the &quot; British Citizen and Empire Worker,&quot; in an article headed &quot; The Great Opportunity,&quot; sounds a different note, and rallies labour to the National Democratic and Labour Party, in view of the proximity of the election, which it welcomes clearly, though not specifically. .Refusal of Passports.Discussing the refusal of passports to Messrs. Henderson, Bowerman, and MacGurk, &quot; Forward &quot; explains that Mr. Barnes cannot be held responsible. The application was made urgently and direct to the Prime Minister. He consulted the Imperial repre-sentatives who happened to be present, and refused the application on the ground that France would be averse to the passage to the continent. Commenting on this cireum-stance, the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; enquires whether Mr. Barnes is being treated as Mr. Henderson was, ordered to stand outside on the doormat while important matters are under discussion in the War Cabinet. It is a monstrous thing that the Labour Member should be ignored in the decision of a matter so vitally important.to British Labour; and, in the absence of satisfactory explanation, there appears to be a primd facie case for the immediate withdrawal of Mr. Barnes from the Government.The &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot; discussing the refusal of passports generally, says that permission was refused to Mr. Tilak and the members of the Indian left wing, whose presence was necessary for an all-round appreciation af the reform scheme. Last year&apos;s refusal of passports for Stockholm led to the collapse of Bussia this year the Trade Unions were challenged by the refusal to allow Miss Bondfield and the members of the Parliamentary Committee to travel to America. Now the refusal to permit Troelstra to visit England and the Henderson party to proceed to Switzerland frustrates a priceless opportunity to mobilise labour and socialist forces in all belligerent countries against militarism.Henderson and Troelstra.&quot; Justice &quot; reports, with caustic comments, Grumbach&apos;s interview with Troelstra at Vevey.In discussing this question the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; refers to the &quot;malicious action of the &apos; Times&apos;&quot; and other papers, in disputing the genuineness of the indirectly conveyed reply of the German Socialists. It alleges that their action was a &quot; manu-factured excuse for blocking the way to an International Conference.&quot; Discussing the Troelstra interview, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; says that &quot; there is evidently some misunder-standing which can be quickly cleared up if a personal interview could be arranged.&quot; A laboured argument then follows in order to prove that nothing in Troelstras statement contradicted the report made by Henderson as to the willingness of the German Socialists to join an i ntemational Conference with the neutral memorandum as a basis of discussion. This evades the point as to the accuracy of the allegation made by Mr. Henderson in the first instance, with which the &quot;Times &quot; joined issue.Mr. Barnes at Glasgow.Both the &quot; Herald&quot; and &quot; Forward &quot; regret that Mr. Barnes was not allowed a free hearing at Glasgow, but explain the interruption on the ground of his alliance with a Government which attempts unsuccessfully to fool the people, and which has itself suppressed free expression of opinion as, for instance, by closing the Socialists&apos; Labour press, and by the imprisonment of John Maclean.The Luxury Tax.The &quot; Clarion&quot; criticises this tax on the score that many necessities are taxed while luxuries escape ; while the &quot;Call&quot; thinks that the basis of taxation should not be shifted from income to commodities. The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; condemns the tax from every point of view, and. would, in its place, increase the income tax. The &quot;Workers Dreadnought&quot; considers the luxury tax incapable of effective enforcement.
SECkET \ iiioport i&quot;&apos;ro:  the tfiniatry of labour for the week ondinr 88th August 1918 (y. 1.51557)Errata.on pcgb 5 - Paragraph headed &quot;Food&quot; - lino 4 - for &quot;now br^ad&quot; road &quot;Lur bread&quot;On page 7.   1ine 6.for &quot;owners&quot; read &quot;builders&quot;
(C.) Home Affairs,The G.F.T.U. and the Parliamentary Committee.&quot;Justice&quot; deals with the frequent bickerings between these two bodies, which have an immediate difference on the subject of Mr. Gompers&apos; visit to England, and thinks that steps should be taken at once to put an end to the present antagonism which is a danger to the Labour movement.The Bus Strike.Comment on the strike of female omnibus conductors is found in all papers, and support of the women&apos;s demand is unanimous. The &quot; New Witness &quot; considers that the attempt to pay the women lower wages is only a first step towards installing them permanently in the rnens places on lower pay. The &quot; Nation &quot; thinks that &quot; equal pay for equal work&quot; is a position on which the whole Labour world must take its stand, if a pitiful struggle between underpaid women and unemployed men is to be avoided after the war. Practically every paper comments in similar terms, though several, including notably the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; critize the absence of notice of the impending strike.Food.&quot;Justice&quot; alleges that 80 per cent, of the milk now consumed is so filthy as to be unfit for consumption without the use of chemicals and on this ground attacks the farmers and big distributors. The paper also suggests that though the skin disease prevalent at Burnley and Barnsley is not specifically due to-riew*bread alone, it may be explained by the fact that children are compelled to consume indigestible bread and filthy milk.The &quot; Co-operative News&quot; referring to the meat question, says that the chief grievance is the inability of the poorer classes to afford their weekly share at the present prices.Coal.Several papers refer to the shortage. The &quot; Clarion &quot; suggests that men should be returned from the front for work in the mines, their places being taken by those inexperienced young men who took refuge in the mines to escape service. It also considers that those seams should be worked to the uttermost, where coal can be easily obtained, whether the owners agree or not.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; questions the truth of the alarmist reports as to the position. &quot;Men have been drawn from the mines, it is true, but not to the extent of making the difference between reasonable sufficiency and actual famine.&quot; It throws the blame for the present position on the coal owners (on the authority of a quotation from the &quot; Times &quot;) and trusts the patriotism of the miners to do all possible to minimise hardship.(D.) The War.Pacifism.The &quot; Bradford Pioneer&quot; prints a paragraph on &quot; Interned prisoners in Germany.&apos;&apos; It consists of two extracts from Mr. Gerard&apos;s book and is intended to establish that the ill-treatment of the British in Germany was solely a measure of retaliation for the internment of the Germans in England in the autumn,of 1914.The same paper and the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; publish a manifesto from the National Administrative Council of the I. L. P. on the subject of the convocation of an Inter-national Labour Conference as a necessary preliminary to a lasting peace. It examines the reasons why such a conference has not yet been convoked,&quot;&quot; and alleges that the obstaclelies in the determination of belligerent Governments to realise, regardless of the sacrifice, of life, their imperialistic conquests and grasping commercial schemes.&quot;Forward&quot; prints a series of extracts from&apos;Gerard&apos;s &quot;Face to Face with Kaiserism.&quot; The underlying suggestion is that wars are made by Kings and by Kings alone, in defiance of any opinion of their peoples, and that the only class drawing-advantage from war and its results is the capitalist class.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and other papers give prominence to the Labour Conference at Perth, Australia, which passed anti-conscription and pacifist resolutions.
III. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The situation in this area has been seriously disturbed during the past week owing to the strike of women on the buses and tubes. This has caused considerable dislo-cation in munitions aieas, more particularly at Woolwich, where the travelling facilities are always bad.The women engaged on aircraft work seem also to be discontented on the question of wages, while the men are determined to support their demands.At various West London Aircraft Works suspicion is prevalent among the workers that the embargo is being brought into action secretly, and meetings are being held upon this matter.At a recent meeting of dockyard workers at Woolwich it was decided to adopt the Shop Stewards&apos; agreement, while the meeting endorsed the policy of the Workers&apos; Union is demanding a 20s. rise for minimum wage workers in the Dockyard.A meeting of women and girls in the Cartridge Factory at Woolwich, was held on the 23rd, at which Matt. Horsburgh and Miss Bond field urged upon the audience the importance of joining the National Federation of Women Workers, so that grievances might more easily be placed before the authorities.uSouth-Westem.This district has been somewhat disturbed by the recent agitation on the &apos;bus and tramway services, but, except at Bath and Bristol, the trouble does not seem to have assumed very serious proportions.In other respects the condition of the district is quiet.-It is suggested that more serious measures are necessary to call attention to the expected fuel shortage, since otherwise much unrest is likely to arise when the shortage actually occurs.West Midlands.The situation in this area is at present very satisfactory, and practically no unrest has recently been evident.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Serious disturbance has prevailed throughout this area, but has now to some extent subsided. The co-operative employees are, however, still threatening a stoppage in many places, in the event of which much distress and inconvenience would be caused, since a very large number of people in this area depend upon the Co-operative Society for their supplies.The Nottingham women tramway Avorkers, who had threatened to strike in support of their demand for a 5.?. increase, have deferred this action pending a national settle-ment., They are, however, determined ultimately to insist npon the concession of their demands.A serious position has also arisen in the lace trade of this district, owing to the shortage of coal, which had led to unemployment. The suggestion is now made that the Government should supplement trade union unemployment funds, by organising some such system as that at present in action in the cotton trade, though higher grants are demanded than in the latter case.The Lincoln Joint Workers Shop Stewards Committee is very indignant at the action of the Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors in offering their services to the Government during the recent embargo dispute. At present the Committee are practically threatening to boycott discharged men, but meetings have been called to give the matter further consideration.North-Western.The position in this area is not very satisfactory, and considerable unrest prevails throughout.The coalheavers of Liverpool, Birkenhead, and Bootle have taken a ballot upon the question of a resumption of overtime and the reference of their application to arbi-tration, which has resulted in a strong vote against resumption. At the two former places the voting seems to have been actually in favour, hut at Bootle the ballot went strongly against resumption.
The findings of the Liverpool Joint Conciliation Board as tp what must be deemed new or repair&apos;work were considered&apos; at a meeting of the Mersey Federation recently, and were unconditionally refused by the meeting. It was pointed out that the decision was at variance with some existing agreements, and was in consequence bound to produce trouble. The men claim on their side that all work done on a ship after it has been taken over from the owners-is repair work. The dispute between the Federation and the shop stewards was also discussed at the same meeting, and it was decided to take a direct vote of the affiliated unions as to whether the Federation or the Reconstruction Committee should be the controlling body.The Liverpool branch of the Municipal Employees Association held a mass meeting on the 25th, at which about 500 were present. The speakers urged strongly the suppression of sectionalism, and gave a report of the work which bad been carried on in the last few months. A resolution was adopted demanding an advance of 15*. all round, and stipulating that the woineifs wages should be made equal to those of the men when they did equal work.Northern.Slight casual unrest has occurred in this area, but this is in no case serious.The foremen of the Newcastle area are agitating for an advance in wages, and will probably put forward a demand for an increase of 11. 10s. per week. There does not, however, seem to be any likelihood of a strike should the demand be refused.The fuel question is apparently receiving much attention in this area, and it is reported locally that indignation at the inadequacy of the ration is general and intense.South Wales.Slightly more unrest has been evident in this area, but this seems for the most part to have subsided. Trouble has developed at the Cwmcarn collieries owing to the secession of various overmen and firemen from their association, and it is alleged that they have received extra pay from their employers for seceding. The Colliery Examiners&apos; Association is protesting against this, and it is possible that the miners may also be induced to join in the agitation.The railwaymen are demanding an increased war bonus of 10s. or 11. a week.Scotland.The situation in this district is fairly satisfactory.Mr. Barnes has been accorded an unfavourable reception at his recent meetings in Glasgow; the final one on the 19th was of a peculiarly disorderly character, and Mr. Barnes was entirely refused a hearing owing to the action of the rebel element. Well-known agitators, such as Gallacher, McManus, and Tommy Clark, were apparently present at these hostile receptions.The Glasgow Trades Council has since held a meeting at which a protest was entered against the action of those who denied Mr. Barnes a fair hearing.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.The situation has been considerably disturbed during the past week, but some improvement is now evident.The Admiralty Labour Department has five new strikes to report.These include a strike of 120 riveters at Messrs. Ramage and Ferguson, Glasgow, who allege that the firm has instituted a change in practice without consulting the men; and, secondly, a strike of carpenters at the British Construction Company, Bristol, owing to the dismissal without notice, but after warning, of two of their members for insubordination. In the latter ease 300 labourers joined in sympathy. After several meetings the men decided to resume work, but the labourers have now put forward a claim for 2d. an hour increase, which will be referred to arbitration.A strike of 300 engineers also occurred at Messrs. J. Thorneycroft, -Southampton, owing to a demarcation dispute with the shipwrights regarding the fixing of gun pedestals.   The litters at Harland and Wolffs, Day, Summers, and Co., and Dixon
Brothers ceased work in sympathy., At a mass meeting of the men on the 23rd, it was agreed to resume on the 26th.A strike of railwaymen in the employment of the Swansea Harbour Trustees lias been in progress owing to dissatisfaction with a recent wage award. The men claimed C)s. a week increase, which was refused. They then put forward a claim for 10s. Terms have now been agreed upon and work has been resumed.The Ministry of Munitions reports.a total of 3,325 men involved in strikes for the week ending the 21st August. This number does not include the transport workers&apos; strike.   No very serious strike seems to be at present in progress.At the Richmond Gas Stove Company, Warrington, a strike of 200 men took place owing to the refusal of the firm to pay certain outworking allowances. Work has now been resumed and the dispute has been settled.An important strike has occurred in the Dublin building trade, where the men demand an increase of %\d. an hour. At present over 10,000 men in the building trade are affected, while 6,000 engaged on aircraft work have joined them. It is also feared that the trouble may spread to the Electrical Trades Union. The employers offer \d. an hour, but this has been refused.A number of dock labourers are also on strike at Cork, with the result that trade is paralysed in the South of Ireland.The Coal Controller has six new stoppages to report, involving 136,090 men.The surface workers&apos; dispute developed into a strike throughout the Yorkshire coal-field on the 22nd, but work was in most cases resumed upon the next day, when a settlement had been reached, setting aside Judge Benson&apos;s award and providing for a new arbitrator to consider the whole dispute afresh.The other cases reported do not seem to be of great importance.The War Office Contracts Department had no new stoppages of work to report.The strike of omnibus employees spread later to the workers on the tubes, though the stoppage was not so complete in the latter case. After a very stormy meeting the omnibus employees were finally persuaded to return to work upon an agreement that that the whole dispute should be referred back to the Committee on Production. As regards the strikers on the tubes, the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymen fias implied willingness to negotiate their claims, when work has been completely resumed. In most cases this is being resumed to-day, but no official negotiations have yet been set on foot to secure a final settlement. The strike committee apparently consider the present resumption of work to be merely an armistice, though for the moment the trouble seems to have subsided.The strike of Co-operative employees at Longsight and Pelaw, who demanded an increase of wages for unskilled workers, now threatens to extend to other districts, mainly in the north of England. Thus works at Dunstan-on-Tyne, Newcastle, Ponte-fract, Manchester, and Oldham will be affected, and about 10,000 workers will be involved. It is feared that the distribution of supplies may in consequence be seriously affected. The trouble in the co-operative movement is discussed in Part I of this Report.(b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.The Admiralty Labour Department reports a dispute at Messrs. Eamage and Ferguson, Glasgow, where the journeymen caulkers are refusing to work with appren-tices. Urgent work is being delayed, though no actual stoppage is involved in this case.No other disputes of importance are noted.Various controversial cases are reported by the Ministry of Munitions.At Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, the dispute as to the foreman, whose discharge was demanded by the men, has been temporarily settled; but there seems to be some fear that the trouble may once more arise, as the foreman in question is still extremely unpopular.The ironmoulders employed by Mackenzie and Moncur, Edinburgh, have threatened to cease work unless certain women dilutees on moulding work are paid fully-skilled moulders&apos; wages. A conference on the subject has been arranged to take place at Glasgow.The decision of a Munitions Tribunal, which has given an award unfavourable to the carpenters of a certain firm at Tottenham Hale, caused the threat of a strike cn the 27th August unless some concession was obtained. The dispute appears to be connected with the 12^ per cent, controversy. The firm, on their side, threaten to prosecute if the men strike.
At Messrs. Palmer&apos;s worksl and Messrs. D. Petrie, West Ealing, the skilled wood-workers refused to allow women to continue to do woodwork for aeroplanes. They have finally been persuaded to continue the present arrangement pending the decision of the conference of woodworkers&apos; trade unions now sitting at Birmingham.The Coal Controller has no new controversial cases to report.The Miners&apos; Federation and the National Council of Mine-workers other than Miners have now accepted in principle the proposals put forward regarding the payment of war-wage for overtime and substituted&apos;shifts.,The War Office Contracts Department reports nov new cases of dispute.A strike of co-operative employees is threatened in Leeds, where the workers demand largely increased wages, the payment of men&apos;s rates to all substituted women, and the reduction of hours to a maximum of forty-eight. The case is under consideration by the Airedale Wages and Hours Board, but at present difficulties have arisen over the second part of the demand. It is hoped that some settlement may be reached which may prevent a strike.   The matter is referred to in Part I.The Committee on Production heard 59 cases last week, 31 in London and 28 in Glasgow.These include claims by workers in the electrical trade, ironfounders, railwaymen, builders, steel makers, leather workers, and others.The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports 124 differences for the week ending the 24th August. These include 20 claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus ; the majority of the total number of cases fall within the engineering, shipbuilding, and metal trades group.0%
