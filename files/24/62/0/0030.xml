Copy of letter from Mr. Clyneg to Lord Crawford.Palace Chambers, Westminster, S&apos;.r. 1.10th August, 1918.Bear Lord Crawford,X am much obliged for your letter of the 15th August with reference to the Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure.I appreciate to the full the invaluable work which you and your colleagues have done in the national interest during the last two years and it is in no sense in disparagement of that work that I feftl bound to say that I concur in the Committee&apos;8 rec ommendations,Complete unification of control both financial and administrative seems to me to be essential if the maximum efficiency is to be obtained from the vast machine required to feed the country under war conditions,   I have reason tc believe that this viev, Which was. strongly held by Lord Rhondda, is also shared by the Treasury and in any case I do not think that it will be possible to refrain from acting upon the recommendations of a body like the committee on National Expenditure, arrived at an they have been after a prolonged and exhaustive enquiry. 1 do not think in these circumstances that any useful purpose would be served by discussing further the grounds on which these recommendations were based.I propose at the end of this week to take a short and much needeefctfest, but in the meantime I propose that the usual formal steps should be taken to oancel the Warrant under which the Royal Commission at present hold authority direct from the King and am asking Mr.&apos; Mint our to confer with the Treasury with the .object of ascertaining their views as to the precise method of financial control which they desire us to adopt.Believe me,Yours sincerely,(ScU)   J.R. CLYNBS *i w o *  * m        * .se -i:   4 i f* v- (**(iii)fopy ef letter from Lord Crawford to Mr. Clynes. .Trafalgar House, Waterloo Place,SVr        &quot;116th August, yn.fitDear Mr. Clynes,I have read your letter with much surprise.I must remind you that at our interview on the 1st August last, I asked you to specify any subject of complaint made against the Royal Commission.   During a conversation which lasted an hour, you yourself criticised our work in no single particular nr detail, I claimed that the vague and injurious charges prevalent in your Department should be formulated in a concrete manner, and, you agreed with me that my request was perfectly fair.   I left under
the impression that you would instruct critics of the Royal Corn-mission to make their charges specific.Since the first August the report of the Select Committee has been issued.   This Committee only enquiredinto financial control, its reference not permitting investigation of other branches of the Royal Commission^ work.   In point of fact, no suggestions have been made on these ,subjects nor, except incidentally, were they mentioned in evidence submitted by the Royal Commission.On the question of financial control to which the report is limited, I have already assured you, that subject to Treasury assent, the Royal Commission is anxious to acquiesce in any pro-pcsal made by yourself or the Select Committee, my sole ambition being to promote the efficiency of our work. You are aware that the present scheme of control was laid down a short time ago after prolonged and exhaustive examination by the Treasury.Now, however, you have decided that the Royal Commision shall be dissolved.   Ho recommendation to this effect has been made by the Select Committee.   You yourself have made no corn-plaint whatever as to the efficiency of my Commission.&apos;   So far as I am aware the Cabinet is satisfied.   I therefore ask for an official meeting at the earliest moment in order that I may be informed cf the grounds on which you have decided to dissolve a body, which in my opinion, has rehdered good service.I regret that you are shortly leaving London, as this is a matter of pressing urgency which I cannot discuss with subordinates.   I am therefore, at your disposalvfrom the moment ycu receive this letter.Meanwhile, I am forwarding a copy cf the correspondenceto the Cabinet, as it is only upon their directions that theSecretary cf State can be instructed to move His Majesty tocancel the warrant of the Royal Commission.I am,Yours JUJithfully,(Sd.) CRAWFORD   &amp; BALCARRES.Rt. Hon. J.R. Clynes, M.P. Ministry of Pood,Palace Chambers, 3.W. 1.(iv)Copy of, letter from. Lord Crawford to Secretary, War Cabinet.Trafalgar House, Waterloo Place, London, S.W. 1.16th August, 1918.Dear Sir Maurice Hankey,I shall be obliged if you will circulate the enclosed to the War Cabinet forthwith *I am,Yours faithfully, (Sd.)
