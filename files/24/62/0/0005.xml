NORTH SEA.OPERATIONS (OTHER THAN ANTI-SUBMARINE) CARRIED OUT BY AIRCRAFT DURING MAY 1918.May Itith.Killingholme.-Large America F. 2 4291 (Pilot, Captain Pattison), whilst on patrol in position about 50o N.N.W. of Borkum Reef, sighted a Zeppelin at 1635, on the port beam, at an altitude of 8,000 feet. The Zeppelin dropped several bombs, put out water ballast, and also let out some smoke. At 1655 the seaplane got into position under the Zeppelin at 8,000 feet and fired 120 rounds, the Zeppelin being then at 30,000 feet. The forward gun jammed three times, and 60 rounds were fired with the rear gun and some hits were observed.The airship rose to 14,000 feet followed by the seaplane, which opened fire from 11,000 feet, when the gun jammed for the fourth time. It was then observed that material was being thrown overboard from the Zeppelin. The seaplane continued to attack until 1730, then broke off the engagement in position approximately 70 miles N.W. of Heligoland.Six enemy destroyers were observed underneath the seaplane heading west; these opened fire with one or two rounds. At 1735 the oil pipe broke, and at 1750 the seaplane landed on the water and the oilpipe was repaired with tape. The flight was resumed, and after attempting to communicate the position of the Zeppelin and destroyers the seaplane returned to base.May &apos;60th.Yarmouth-Large America Seaplanes N. 4295 and 8660 (Pilots, Captain Fitzrandolf and Captain Young), whilst on long reconnaissance patrol, at 1235 sighted two hostile two-seater seaplanes approaching from the rear S.E. N. 4295 (the other seaplane was previously forced to land owing to slight engine trouble) turned to attack them, upon which the enemy split up their formation one turning to port and the other to starboard.   The latter steered for Borkum, and may possibly have seen 8660 on the water.   After firing several rounds the Second Pilofs gun jammed,- and after firing half a tray of ammunition the W/T operators gun jammed.  All the. forward guns were thus out. of action.  The enemy was chased for 10 minutes, when the W/T operator cleared the jam in his gun, and fired another tray of ammunition. No. 4295 then returned to look for 8660, but owing to bad visibility it could not be located.  Nothing further has been heard regarding this machine ; the crew, consisting of Captain T. V. Young, D.S.C., R.A.F., Ensign J. T. Roe, U.S.N., F.C., Corporal F. Grant, 211338 (E), Private J. N. Money, 207040
OV/T), and Private W. F. Chase, 213914 (G/L), must be considered as Jost.On several, other occasions during the month Yarmouth Large Americas observed, enemy seaplanes which had superior speed and avoided engagement. On 21 st May three seaplanes were seen to be resting on the water in the lee of trawlers, obviously waiting for the Large America patrol, and took off on the approach of the British machines. Their tactics appear to be to lie off and wait until one of the British machines gets out -of the formation and then attack.May 20th.Killingholme.-Seaplane No. 4291 (Pilots, Lieut. Robinson and Ensign Hodges), whilst on patrol, at 1120, when in position 325 P, sighted a Zeppelin on the port bow about 7 miles distant flying at approximately 10,000 feet. Course was altered to attack, and the enemy was engaged for 10 minutes at a range of 4,000 feet.The seaplane N. 4290 also gave chase, but was unable to get within striking distance.No. 5 GROUP, DOVER PATROL. (OVERSEAS UNITS).May 1st to 31st inclusive.RECONNAISSANCE.A number of W/T Coastal and Photographic reconnaissances were carried out during the month of May. Those reconnais-sances of particular interest are as follows : On May 9th it was ascertained that the barrage was clear of shipping. A special low reconnaissance on May 10th confirmed the fact that H.M.S. &quot;Vindictive&quot; was fast aground about 50 yards from the end of the Ostende Pier and obstructing about one-third of fairway.Salvage operations on the blockships at Ostende and Zeebrugge have been much hindered by our bombing forma-tions.Fleet reconnaissances carried out on May 30th disclosed that 28 enemy destroyers reported alongside mole on previous day had left, and as they were not within the barrage, the recon-naissance was extended to 10 miles N.E. of Scheveningen, and .25 miles seaward no hostile destroyers were observed.Many excellent photographs have been taken during the month which have given, in particular, most useful information in regard to the sunken blockships, silting sand being shown -clearly round the outer blockships at Zeebrugge.o  (33) AS 5950  Pk 375  8/13  E &amp; S A 2
One of the seaplane sheds at Ostende was shown to he badly damaged. Other photographs have disclosed a new aerodrome N.W. of Ertvelde and a portion of an aerodrome under construction S.E. of Zedelghem.Photographs also show that the planking of the E. and W. piers at Ostende has been removed presumably to prevent the landing of hostile units and about 40 yards of the E. pier destroyed.The swing bridge at the Southern end of the Lock at Zeebrugge is open it is interesting that this bridge has never been shown closed since the naval raid of the 23rd March last.BOMBING RAIDS.Bombing raids have been possible on the majority of days in in the month, and excellent results have been obtained. Prominent among these are three hits obtained on hangars at Ostende on May 6th and numerous direct hits on the Mole at Zeebrugge on several occasions.Enemy shipping has also been attacked, and on May 20th a direct hit was obtained with a 230-lb. bomb on the boAvs of a destroyer.Lieut. Coward on 21st May made a direct hit on a torpedo boat destroyer in the fairway, Zeebrugge, and a photographic reconnaissance confirmed that this destroyer was sunk.On 28th May Lieut-Colonel P. F. M. Fellowes and Observer Sergeant H. Pritchard left on a special mission in a DH 4 aeroplane to bomb the lock gates at Zeebrugge from 200 feet, and it is regretted that the machine did not return, and two search patrols failed to elicit any trace.The summary of bombs dropped on pages 6 and 7 is evidence of the incessant manner in which objects of military importance at and in the neighbourhood of Zeebrugge and Ostende have been bombed, and photographic reconnaissance confirms the large amount of damage done.Evidence of the results from bombing is found in the statements made by Repatries, a bargeman, and an agent, all of Avhom have witnessed air raids. One informant stated that the raid which took place on the 23rd of March last resulted in the sinking of three barges laden with cement, a submarine, two torpedo boats, and a Dutch ship captured by the enemy and taken to Bruges. Twenty-two workmen were killed, and 100 injured, and on another occasion, when two asphyxiating gas tanks were damaged, 70 men were killed.
ENEMY AIRCRAFT.Enemy aircraft have been active, and have attacked our reconnaissance and bombing formations on a number of occa-sions. Among these engagements the following are of particular interest: On May 4th three enemy aircraft over Middlekerke attacked a W/T Coastal Reconnaissance and an escorting machine. The observer of the W/T machine Avas shot dead, and the pilot severely wounded, but he succeeded in flying his machine back to Bray Dunes. The observer of the escorting machine was wounded this machine also returned safely.No. 213 Sqiiaclron on May 8th attacked a formation of six enemy aircraft joined later by six others. Captain H. D. 0. Paynter destroyed three. Two of the enemy machines crashed into the sea, one fell in flames, and a fourth was driven clown out of control by Lieut. C. P. Brown.In a general combat by 202 Squadron with three escorting machines from 213 Squadron-on May 9th, one enemy machine was brought clown in flames by Lieut. G. I). Smith.No. 213 Squadron whilst on patrol on May 11th encountered eight Albatross Scouts near Middlekerke. A general engage-ment ensued and two enemy aircraft were destroyed by Capt. L. H. Slatter, and two others driven down out of control, one of which was probably destroyed. One of our machines failed to return.Five enemy seaplanes were attacked by a patrol of No. 204 Squadron on May 17th and one enemy seaplane was driven down, and&quot;landed in the sea damaged 30 miles N.E. of Ostende.Lieut. L. A. Ashfield (Pilot) and (G/L) L. A. Allan, whilst on a photographic patrol, were attacked by a single-seater enemy machine and the latter was driven clown out of control.Capt. J. W. Pinder and Lieut. W. E.Grey of No. 213 Squadron shot clown an Albatross Scout, which was attacking a Belgian kite balloon. &apos;On May 21st Lieut. L. A. Ashfield and Corpl. L. A. Allan (G/L) attacked five Albatross Scouts oil Ostende; one of which was brought clown in flames, and another driven down out of control into the sea.   -On May 29th, whilst returning from a bomb raid, one of our squadrons was attacked by seven enemy aircraft over Ghistelles, One Phalz Scout dived on Lieut. D. A. Macartney (Pilot), Lieut G. D. Dardis (Observer). Lieut. Dardis fired a burst of 50 rounds into it. The E.A. turned completely on its back in a vertical nose dive and broke up in the air.Another enemy aircraft an Albatross Scout dived on Lieut. A. M. Phillips (Pilot) and Lieut. N. C. MacDonald (Observer). Lieut. MacDonald Avaited until E.A. was within 100 yards range and then fired 30 rounds. Tracers were seen going into the cockpit of E.A. Avhich Avent cIoavu in an uncon-trollable spin. Another. E.A. Albatross Scout attacked Lieut. C.B. -Taylor (Pilot) and Lieut. J. R. Jackman (Observer) from
the rear. Lieut. Jackman waited until E.A. was within 50 yards range and fired a short hurst of 20 rounds into it. E.A. stalled, dived vertically, and was last seen in mist still in a vertical nose dive.Again, on May 31st the same squadron, immediately after they had bombed Bruges Docks, were attacked by several Phalz Scouts, One dived on Lieut. G. A. Macartney (Pilot), Lieut. G. D. Darclis (Observer), who fired a burst of 50 rounds into enemy machine, which stalled and went down in a spin with a trail of smoke issuing from it.Another Phalz-Scout dived on Lieut. F. Smethurst (Pilot), Lieut. E. G. T. Chubb (Observer), who fired about 50 rounds.. Tracers were seen to enter the cockpit of the jenemy machine, which suddenly dived, and was seen still in a vertical nose dive about 11,000 feet below.After a bombing raid by No. 217 Squadron on Zeebrugge,. four hostile scouts (Phalz) were encountered, two above and two below formation. Gunlayer S. F. Briggs was wounded before firing a shot, but quickly opened fire, and after one pan had been expended from the Lewis gun one of the scouts was seen to go down vertically with a thin trail of smoke issuing from machine ; a flash was seen after he had dropped a few hundred feet, and big clouds of smoke and flame were seen as the enemy machine turned into a spin.Enemy machines have also been shot down out of control by Capt. Gossip, Lieut. Hill, and Lieut. Harston.SUMMARY OF BOMBS DROPPED BY FIFTH GROUP,R.A.F.From lst-31st May 1918 (inclusive).Target.	Bomts dropped.

ANTI-SUBMARINE OPERATIONS. General Remarks.Statistics for the month of May are based on figures for five weeks ending June 1st, 1918.During this period aircraft (excluding kite balloons) engaged on anti-submarine work in home waters have carried out 4,268 patrols, covering a distance of 661,548 miles. Of this distance 462,969 miles have been fiWn by seaplanes and aeroplanes and 198,579 miles by airships. The total time in the air for seaplanes, aeroplanes, and airships is approximately 15,702 hours.Submarines have been sighted and attacked on the following occasions: 		Submarines.	Date.	Station.

E. S. Smith, Observer A.M. 2. F. G. Hayward), whilst on patrol at 1650 at a height of 1,000 feet sighted, on the port quarter, in position approximately 51Q 53&apos; N., 50 35&apos; W., a periscope cutting through the water, and leaving a very pronounced wake. The seaplane immediately altered course, but the periscope disap-peared while still H miles away. The seaplane continued along its course and attempted to drop a 230-lb. bomb, which failed to release. The seaplane headed about, and within five minutes the periscope was again seen on the port quarter steering N. at right angles to its former course. One&apos; 100-lb. bomb was dropped which exploded 20 feet ahead of the submarine, which was plainly visible under water approximately 50 feet ahead of the swirl. At 1710 the submarine was again observed steering North with about 6 inches of periscope showing. Course was altered, but the submarine disappeared H minutes before the seaplane could get over it. The submarine was plainly visible again, 100 feet ahead of her swirl, and another
attempt was made to drop the 230-lb. bomb, which howeverr again failed to release. The submarine was clearly outlined under water and appeared to be at least 200 feet long. Following her third disappearance the submarine was not again seen. A signal was sent to base, which was not received owing to jamming. An airship and three trawlers in the vicinity were informed by flash lamp of the position and course of the submarine. Two of the trawlers were seen to alter course in the direction of the reported submarine. Two large cargo-vessels were also warned of the proximity of the submarine.May 1st.Seaton Carew.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane No. 2101 (Pilot Flight Sub-Lieut. Richardson), whilst on patrol sighted a submarine S.E. of Sunderland. At 1705 a bomb was dropped about 10 yards ahead of the submerged submarine and appeared to take effect, as numerous bubbles appeared. Owing to shortage of petrol the pilot had to return to base, and was therefore unable to ascertain further results.May 6th.Newlyn. Short Seaplane N. 1767 whilst on patrol sighted the periscope of a submarine in position 50o 37&apos; N., 40 58&apos; W, at 0710. Two 100-lb. bombs were dropped; the first failed to explode, but the second one exploded 20 feet ahead of the feather. A. very heavy explosion, which was felt in the machine at a height of 1.000 feet, and a large upheaval were caused. No patrol vessels were observed in the vicinity with which to communicate. Engine failure was then experienced, and a calcium flare having been dropped, the machine made for Padstow for inspection and more bombs.May 8th.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane F.E. 2 B. 6586 (Pilot Lieutenant Penny, Observer Sub-Lieut. Bell), whilst on patrol sighted a /periscope at 1255 going N. six miles E. of Sunderland. The aeroplane proceeded to the spot, but nothing further was seen,, and a signal was sent to destroyers. At 1320, four miles east of Seaham another aeroplane was seen to drop a bomb. No. 6586 proceeded to the spot and again saw a periscope moving E. A drifter was seen to drop a depth charge, and No. 6586 dropped a bomb which was seen to explode in the centre of the disturbance caused by the depth charge. Much oil came to the surface.May Sih.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane F.E. 2 B. 5542 (Pilot Lieutenant. Anscow), whilst on patrol sighted a submarine in position 15 miles due east of Redcar, and at 1905 bombed her, and afterwards observed patches of oil on the surface.
Ashington.-Aeroplane F.E.2.B. A. 5684 (Pilot Lieutenant Taylor, Observer Signaller Hazelwood) whilst on patrol sighted and bombed an enemy submarine at 1325 in position 13 miles E. by S. of Seaham.May 8th.Newlyn.-Short Seaplane N. 1255 (Pilot Ensign Stanley), whilst on patrol sighted a submarine at 1218 in position approximately 50o 32&apos; N., 50 15&apos; W., steering in a N.E. direction at an estimated speed of 14 knots. The seaplane immediately planed down to 800 feet in the direction .of the submarine, which submerged to an estimated depth of 100 feet, when within a distance of about a mile, leaving behind it a mass of foam. One 100-lb. bomb was dropped about 90 feet ahead of this, and one 65-lb. bomb about 600-700 feet further on. W/T signals were sent to&quot;.all ships&quot; and to base, and the vicinity was searched, but nothing further developed, The submarine was about 300-400 feet long, with stream-lined conning tower painted a very light grey or a white colour.May $tit.Cattewater.-Short Seaplane N. 2836 (Pilot Ensign Macaulay, Observer W. T. Hibbeth), whilst on patrol sighted a submarine at 1930 B.S.T. in position 50o 18&apos; N., 30 22&apos; W. One 230-lb. bomb was dropped from a height of 1,000 feet which failed to-explode. One 100-lb. bomb was dropped three minutes later which exploded about 200 feet off the port bow of the submarine.May 10th.Seaton Carew.-Sopwith Baby Seaplane N. 2109 (Pilot Lieutenant R. R. Richardson), sighted the periscorje of a sub-, marine 4 miles S.E. of Skinningrove. One 65-lb. bomb was dropped, which exploded about 25 feet ahead and to the right of the position where the periscope had been seen. Sopwith Baby N, 2107 proceeded to and was patrolling the vicinity when N. 2109 left.May lOih &apos;.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane Blackburn Kangaroo B. 9971 (Pilot Lieutenant Waring, Observer Lieutenant Knights-bridge) sighted a submarine in position 540 28&apos;:N., 0o 26&apos; W. H miles E.N.E. of H. Buoy, Robin Hood Bay, and at 1547 two bombs were dropped which fell abreast and 10 yards on either side of the submarine.
Scilly. Large America Seaplane N. 4341 whilst on patrol at 0820 sighted a submarine on the surface in position approxi-mately 49Q 47&apos; N., 60 25&apos; W. The submarine submerged, and two 230-lb. bombs were dropped 200 and 250 yards ahead of the end of the wake. A signal was sent to &quot; all ships,&quot; and the seaplane circled the position for 15 minutes at 200 feet. No result was apparent.Note. This submarine was sunk at a later date, and the following facts have been elicited as to the above-mentioned attack : Between 9 and 10 a.m. (German summer time) &quot; U. 103 &quot; was proceeding on the surface on a southerly course. Including the officers, over half a dozen of the boat&apos;s complement were on the bridge, when attention was drawn to a cloud of smoke on the horizon in a south-easterly direction. Almost imme-diately afterwards the commanding officer apparently became aware of the presence of aircraft, as he gave the order &apos;! Alarm  Dive.&quot; The other officers and men on the conning tower went clown below without having seen or heard what it was that had attracted the commanding officers attention. . Under interrogation the commanding officer could not be induced to give any information as to whether he sighted or heard the seaplane, or at what distance it was. It is reasonable to suppose that, had he heard it, others on the bridge would have done so. The navigating warrant officer stated that he thought the seaplane must have been approaching from the direction of the sun, and was consequently difficult to make out.On the alarm being given, &quot; U. 103 &quot; submerged to between 40 and 50 metres (131-164 feet) and continued apparently on her former course at three-quarter speed (about 7i knots). Four minutes after the alarm the first bomb was heard to explode &quot;very loudly,&quot; and was immediately followed by another. Both were heard above the boat and apparently a: little ahead. No damage was sustained by &quot; U. 103.&quot; On coming to the surface an hour or two later, several bomb splinters Avere found on the deck forward.May 15th.Yarmouth. Short Seaplane N. 1692 (Pilot Lieutenant Nichols, Observer Lieutenant Munday), whilst on patrol sighted the periscope of a submarine at 0845 in position 15 miles S.E. of Shipwash. The seaplane passed over the submarine, which disappeared, but on turning round the pilot observed it behind him, and immediately altered course and headed towards it. On reaching the position of the submarine two periscopes and the top of two masts were seen, and a 230-lb. bomb (21- seconds delay) was dropped from. 1,000 feet, which fell about 15 feet ahead of-the periscopes.
Bubbles were seen to rise to the surface in close proximity to where the bomb fell; after a few seconds this ceased, and bubbles of lesser density were seen to rise. The conning tower then rose to the surface and the submarine was observed to turn on its starboard side, and apparently sink, leaving only a swirl behind it.The seaplane was unable to stay in the vicinity owing to failing light and lack of fuel, so she headed for Felixstowe, where she obtained more fuel, and returned to base next morning.May IQth.Newlyn.-Short Seaplane N. 1616 (Pilot Ensign Stanley, Observer, Lieutenant J. W. Nixon), whilst on patrol, sighted at 1450 in position 50o 33&apos; N,, 50 20&apos; W., a suspicious object, which on investigation proved to be a submarine. A Very&apos;s light signal of the day Avas fired, but Avas not acknoAvledged, and the submarine began to submerge. Tavo 100-lb. (2&apos;5 -seconds delay action) Avere dropped at 1500 from a height of 1,500 feet, the first falling and exploding about 10 feet ahead of the wake, the second exploding about 25 feet ahead and 5 feet to the left of the Avake. The second bomb caused a large agitated circle of oil to appear on the surface of the water, about three times the size of an ordinary bomb burst.W/T signals were sent to base, &quot;all ships&quot; and &quot;all air-ships &quot; and photographs of the position taken.Large patches of oil were observed, and the area Avas searched for an hour, but nothing further Avas observed. Seaplane .then returned to base.The submarine was about 230 feet long, Avith high sharp bow and a high freeboard, and Avas painted dark grey Avith a rusty brown colour camouflage.May llth.Yarmouth. Large America Seaplane No. 4295 (Pilot Cap-tain Cross, Observer Lieutenant Beaver), Avhilst on patrol in company Avith Large America No. 4283 (Pilot Captain Fitz-Randolf, Observer Lieutenant Bell), heard loud enemy W/T signals in position 540 32&apos; N., 40 40&apos; E., but after climbing to 10,000 feet, despite good visibility, no enemy craft AAras sighted. Course Avas altered, and a submarine apparently fully blown, heading in an easterly direction, was sighted in position 540 35&apos; N., 40 30&apos; W., 5 miles distant on the port bow of the seaplane.No. 4295 descended to 1,800 feet, and turned to bring the submarine on her starboard boAv. One and a half trays of ammunition were fired upon the submarine, and splashes were observed all round the conning tower.
As the seaplane passed over it, the submarine submerged, turning to port at the same time. After circling the position twice, the patrol was continued, course being altered to 230o.The submarine resembled the U. 13-16 class ; it was about 130 feet long, and newly painted grey; there was apparently no lettering on the conning tower. It had one mast abaft the conning tower, which was of streamline shape. The bow appeared to be raised, but no gun was observed.May Idth.Dunkirk (217 Squadron, 61st Wing).-Four D.H. 4 aero-planes whilst on patrol attacked a hostile submarine escorted by four destroyers at 1905 15 miles, 346 degrees off Ostende. The submarine dived just before attack. Four 230-lb. bombs were dropped from 800 feet, and four of the same weight dropped from 200 feet, all of which fell close to the periscope.The patrol was shelled by the destroyers, which imme-diately closed round the place where the bombs were dropped. No observations were made after the dropping of the bombs.The submarine was a large type, but it Avas impossible to give details owing to mist which was prevailing at the time of the sighting of the submarine.May 20th.Houton Bay.-Large America Seaplane No. 4247 sighted :and attacked an enemy submarine. No details of this attack have been received.May 2m.Portland,-Wight Seaplane No. 9850 (Pilot Captain Har-rison, Observer Corporal Argent), whilst on patrol sighted at 1030 the presumed wake of a submarine proceeding west in position 50o 35&apos; N., 20 05&apos; E. At 1032 two 100-lb. bombs were dropped 30 feet to starboard of the front of the wake. At 1040 one 100-lb. bomb and one 65-lb. bomb were dropped, both falling from 20 to 25 feet to starboard of the front of the . wake. At 1050 a trawler which had arrived on the spot dropped a depth charge displacing a great deal of wreckage. After circling round the position the seaplane returned to base owing to engine trouble.May 21th.Cattewater. Short Seaplane N. 1258 (Pilot Lieutenant Graham, Observer Lieutenant Stevenson), whilst on patrol sighted at 1712 a submarine fully blown on the surface with two masts up, in position 490 57&apos;N., 3a 53&apos; W. Two 100-lb. bombs were dropped just as the periscope disappeared ; the first exploded 70 feet on the starboard bow and the second exploded 30 feet on the starboard quarter of the submarine, A large quantity of oil and bubbles rose to the surface as a result of the
bombing.   Two calcium flares were dropped and wireless messages sent to base and torpedo boat destroyers.   The sub-marine was of a large type painted grey, with raised bows and two masts fore and aft of her conning tower. May 30th.Seaton Carew.-Sop with Baby Seaplane No. 2111 (Pilot Lieutenant Aldis) whilst on patrol sighted at 0730 in position 540 50&apos; N., 0o 55&apos; W., a periscope and mast both well out of the water, proceeding in a south-easterly direction at an estimated speed of 4 to 5 knots.The seaplane arrived above the submarine just as the conning tower, which was painted grey, came to the surface. One 65-lb. bomb was dropped, about 4 yards on the starboard quarter of the conning tower.The submarine dived and continued on its course, taking about three minutes to submerge properly, and although she was distinguishable for about half a minute under water, she seemed to be in some difficulty, as her course appeared to be somewhat erratic.A series of lights were fired,, and a destroyer and a Black-burn Kangaroo aeroplane came over and searched the area  only a small patch of oil could be seen and no trace of the submarine could be found. After patrolling the area for 40 minutes, the seaplane returned to base owing to shortage of petrol.May mh.Seaton Carew. Blackburn Kangaroo Aeroplane B. 9973 (Pilot Lieutenant Dean, Observer Lieutenant Knightsbridge) whilst on patrol sighted at 0750 in position 540 25&apos; N., 0o 25&apos; W., a periscope proceeding in a north-westerly direction 5 miles N.E. of Scarborough.Two 230-lb. bombs were released, one exploding just ahead of the wash, the other 30 yards ahead of the first bomb.A quantity of oil came to the surface, being the only result observed. After remaining in the vicinity for 25 minutes, the aeroplane returned to base.May Mh.Cattewater. Short Seaplane N. 1790 (Pilot Lieutenant Partner. Observer Lieutenant Stevenson), whilst on patrol sighted a submarine fully blown on the surface at .0730 in position 50o 13&apos; N., 30 20&apos; W. The submarine submerged just as a 230-lb. bomb was dropped, which fell 450 feet ahead of the oil patch left on the surface, but failed to explode. Two calcium flares were dropped and. wireless messages sent to base, and T.B.D.&apos;s, and surface craft informed.May 30th.Dunkirk (217 Squadron, 61st Wing).-D.H. 4 Aeroplanes Nos. A. 9735 and A. 7772 whilst on patrol sighted a submarine with two periscopes at 1940, 25 miles, 20o from Dunkirk.
Four 230-lb. bombs were dropped, which burst .10-20 yards to port of the target. The aeroplanes circled round the sub-marine, but no definite result of the bombing was observed.May 31s/;.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane F.E.2.B. No. 0535 (Pilot Lieu-tenant Beal, Observer Lieutenant Raby) whilst on patrol sighted a submarine at 2113 in position 540 53&apos; N., I0 12&apos; W., when at a height of 1,200 feet.Tl\e aeroplane descended to an altitude of 300 feet and saw the complete outline of the submarine with the periscope showing intermittently proceeding S.S.E. Two bombs were dropped, the first falling about 15 yards ahead and slightly to port side of the target, the second approximately 7 feet abeam on the starboard side. After the explosion of the second bomb air and oil bubbles, came to the surface. A T.B.D. dropped about six depth charges around the position bombed.May 31st.Seaton Carew.-Sop with Baby Seaplane N. 2111 (Pilot Lieutenant Clutterbuck) whilst on patrol sighted, at 1245 in position 540 32&apos; N., 0o 25&apos; W., the periscope of a submarine proceeding in an easterly direction.One 65-lb. bomb was released, which fell to starboard front of the submarine about 6 yards distant. The periscope disappeared after about 2 minutes and a small quantity of oil. came to the surface.The seaplane patrolled the vicinity for about 10 minutes, but nothing further was observed, so she returned to base.May 31st.Ashington.-Aeroplane F.E.2B. A. 5738 (Pilot Lieutenant Riley, Observer Lieutenant de&apos;Escofet) proceeded to investi-gate the reported position of a submarine.The submarine was observed alongside a fishing vessel in position 550 32&apos; N., I0 30&apos; W.When, the seaplane was about 100 yards distant, the submarine started to submerge, and a man was observed to be climbing into the conning tower of the submarine.Two bombs were dropped in rapid succession ; the first exploded on the forward edge of the conning tower as the submarine submerged, and the second one fell about 15 yards ahead of the first bomb in the direction in which the submarine was travelling.Quantities of oil and bubbles were observed to rise in the position where the submarine was last seen, also a certain amount of wreckage from the fishing vessel, which had been blown up a few minutes previously, and was sinking rapidly.The position was circled&apos; for 30 minutes, more oil and bubbles being seen to rise when the aeroplane left for base.o  AS 5950 B
The submarine was about 200 feet long, newly painted, dark grey and brown. A. square object, possibly a &quot;gun, was observed abaft the conning tower. It had no raised forecastle, but had a long straight bow and a low conning tower; no masts wereJune lsL.Dunkirk.-D.H. 4 Aeroplane, Nos. A. 7846 and A. 7772 whilst on patrol sighted a hostile submarine 3 niiles from Ostende at 2520.

Z. 5 (Pilot Captain Godfrey) sighted small bubbles of oil rising in approximately 50o 56&apos; N. by l0 15&apos; E. Dropped one 100-lb. and one 65-lb. bombs, causing oil to rise in much greater quantities. Trawlers also dropped depth charges. Oil spread to about one mile in length and 100 yards in breadth.On May 17th S.S. Z. 5 (Pilot Captain G. L. Lowis), dropped two 100-lb. and two 65-lb. bombs on rising oil bubbles in position approximately 50o 45&apos; N., O0 431&apos; E., causing bubbles to rise in greater profusion.   II. 56 dropped depth charges.This position has since been extensively bombed by airships, and depth charges dropped by surface craft, and submarine apparently located by sweepers, There is every reason to believe that a submarine was destroyed here.May 19th.Anglesey. Airship S.S. Z. 51 (Pilot Lieutenant Juan 0. Farina) whilst on patrol observed a small oil patch at 1430 in position 520 42&apos; N., 50o 3&apos; W. On closer investigation it was noticed that a few oil bubbles were rising to the surface. A destroyer was called up to investigate the area, and a periscope was observed just under the surface, with a long dark shadow below it. No definite outline could be seen. At 1400 S.S.. Z. 51 rose to a height of 1,400 feet and dropped a 230-lb. bomb which fell about 5 feet abaft the point of aim.The periscope was seen to be travelling in a south bywesterly direction.A U.S.N. destroyer was notified of these facts and dropped a large number of depth charges, whereupon more oil and, bubbles rose.Two more U.S.N. destroyers and two patrol boats arrived in a short time and more depth charges were dropped.It was noticed when the airship left the position for the base, owing to shortage of petrol, that the patch of oil had extended over an area of about lj miles, and oil bubbles o AS 5950 o
were still rising, in the vicinity.The above-mentioned surface craft remainedMay 21st.Folkestone.-Airship S.S. Z. 1.(Pilot Captain N, Grabowsky) whilst on patrol observed the conning tower of a submarine below the surface proceeding east at about two knots in position 51&quot; 01&apos; N., l0 18&apos; E. at 1410. A bomb was dropped and destroyers informed. A patch of heavy oil appeared as a result of the explosion.At 1530 the water became disturbed, and a destroyer dropped a depth charge, whereupon oil rose at once. The airship then dropped another bomb, after which quantities of air bubbles rose for some minutes. Several more depth charges were dropped by the destroyer with no apparent results. Nothing further was observed.May 25th.Folkestone.-Airship S.S. Z. 36 (Pilot Lieutenant FI. R. II. Ward) whilst on patrol sighted at 1245 a submarine with both periscopes showing in position 510 07&apos; N., I0 24&apos; E. One 65-Ib. bomb and one 112-lb. bomb were dropped; the former failed to explode. After the explosion of the 112-lb. bomb oil rose to the surface. Destroyers and a torpedo boat subsequently dropped depth charges, when more oil rose to the surface. The airship, having obtained more bombs from the base, returned to the position and dropped one 65-lb. and one 1004b. bomb, after which oil continued to rise.Station.Longside -East Fortune Howden Lowthorpe Folkestone &apos; Polegate  -Slindon Upton Mullion   -Laira Toller BudePembroke -Anglesey -Luce Bay -TotalTable &quot;B.&quot;Airships.No. of Patrols.97 82 90 28 144 128 CO 22 125 13 1 796 11C 1161,115Time.Miles Covered.Hrs.

The object was long and narrow in shape and tapered at the ends. The approximate position of the object was 480 30&apos; N., 60 35&apos; W. It appeared to be darker towards the centre, but Owing to its being submerged, no clearly defined lines were visible. The ship&apos;s course was shaped by the balloon for the object; several depth charges were dropped ; small bubbles rose to the surface and a swirl also appeared shortly afterwards. Reports from other sources indicates the presence of a submarine in the vicinity.May 27th.Milford Haven.-At 0945 balloon on convoy duty with H.M.S. &quot;P.O. 55.&quot; Visibility being considered too bad to continue observation, the balloon was hauled down.   Within
five minutes of the hauling down of the balloon the convoy was attacked by a hostile submarine. This is believed to be the first occasion on which a convoy has been attacked when accompanied by a balloon.MINES SIGHTED.Mines have been sighted by aircraft on 30 occasions.Yarmouth (seaplanes) - TAvice.Felixstowe - Once.West-gate - Twice.East Fortune (airships) -     -     - Twice.Howden -     -     - Once.Lowthorpe ...

Of this distance 284,920 miles have been flown by heavier-than-air, and 37,780 miles by airships.Submarines have been attacked on eight occasions. Mines have been sighted on eight occasions. Statistics of the work done in the various areas are given in Tables &quot; D,&quot; &quot; E,&quot; &quot; F,&quot;. pages 24 and 25.The following are particulars of the attacks on submarines: April 3rd.Dunkirk.-Tavo triplanes and three seaplanes Avhilst on patrol sighted 25 miles N. of Dunkirk a submarine on the surface heading W.S.W. at a great rate (14-15 knots). Seaplane No. 226, which first sighted the submarine, signalled to the accompanying machines the position of the submarine. Tavo of the seaplanes opened fire on the conning toAver, in which a man was observed to be manoeuvring Avhat was thought to be a gun. One of the triplanes carrying tAvo bombs passed over the submarine; one Avas dropped but did not explode and the other failed to release; the machine-gun was fired at the conning tower.
The submarine dived, and&apos;although the patrol remained in the vicinity for half an hour, it was not seen again.A motor launch in the vicinity was warned and the machines returned to base.April 12th.Cherbourg.-A patrol of seaplanes, after having escorted a convoy, sighted a submarine on the surface heading E. 10 miles S. of the Needles.The submarine disappeared before the seaplanes had got near enough to attack, leaving behind a great upheaval. A calcium flare was dropped on the position of the submarine.English patrol boats were warned of the proximity of the submarine by means of a message buoy.April 22nd.Cherbourg. Two seaplanes, whilst on patrol, sighted at 1130 in position 10 miles N. of Lion-sur-Mer a long wash, presumbly made by a periscope; the sea around was calm and undisturbed. The machines each dropped one bomb on the head of the wake, and remained in the vicinity for 20 minutes, during which time nothing further was observed.April 22nd.Camarat. Two seaplanes, whilst on patrol, sighted a sub-merged submarine with periscopes showing 10 miles N. of Armen proceeding north. Four bombs were dropped, the first two falling to the front of the submarine, and the other apparently fell on the dark form of the submarine, while the third bomb fell 20 metres to starboard. The submarine finally disappeared, leaving a yellow oily matter and debris on the surface, but nothing further was observed.April 23rd.Guernsey. Two seaplanes (G. 8 and G. 5), whilst on escort patrol, sighted a greyish elongated form with a patch of foam at its head. On reaching the position, G. 8 obseiwed the greyish form, disappear, leaving only a wash, on which a bomb was dropped. The convoy was warned, and messages sent to base reporting the presence of a submarine.On receiving the message from the patrol the base sent out two more machines-G. 12 and G. 6. On arrival at the sus-picious area, G. 12 sighted a long V-shaped trail preceded by an upheaval of water. The calmness of the sea enabled the observation of the dark mass of a submarine below the surface to be made.&apos; Two bombs were dropped, which exploded approxi-mately 3 metres in front and to the starboard side of the submarine. G. 8 and G. 5 dropped five bombs. One of the two patrol boats which were in the vicinity reported that a
distinct cessation of the engines of the submarine was heard during the attack. The submarine was not seen again although the area was carefully patrolled.April 23rd.Marquise-Airship V. Z. 2 whilst on patrol N. of Boulogne, sighted at 1535 a suspicious swirl 4 miles off Calais. Two bombs were dropped. Surface craft in the vicinity dropped six depth charges and fired a torpedo at the submarine, whose periscope showed intermittently.April 29th.Sousse. Four seaplanes whilst on patrol sighted first a dark patch, and afterwards two periscopes 1,000 metres away. One bomb was dropped, which fell on the stern of the submarine. Two more bombs were dropped, by other machines, which exploded in the track of the submarine. Nothing more was seen of the submarine.April 2,9th.Algiers. Airship A.T. 6 whilst escorting a convoy received a signal reporting a submarine. On leaving the convoy the airship observed the conning tower of a submarine 6 miles away. The submarine submerged before the position was reached by the airship and only one bomb was dropped, and as nothing further was observed the airship returned to base.Table D.Seaplanes and Aeroplanes.Area.
