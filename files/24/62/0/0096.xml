Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 4th September, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Pre-? in Ireland :-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Twenty-nine applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week, and the value of machines in respect of which loans were granted during the week was £1,657. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to £68,168.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

Farmers were mainly occupied during the week in harvesting the grain crops. In the majority of countries most of the ?, with the exception of late sown spring wheat, is now cut, and in the earlier districts stacking has already begun. Farmers are reported to be taking more care than usual in scouring corn atacks owing to probable delay in threshing. A feature of the reports received is the reference to the more general use of machinery for harvesting purposes.

Turnips are a variable crop, but have improved considerably during August. On light soils they are in many places poor. Mangels promise to be a good crop generally. The condition of the potate crop remains on the whole satisfactory. The sowing of catch crops is now in progress in many districts. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining vetch seeds, a smaller area than usual of this crop is likely to be sown. Hardy green turnips, rye, and Italian Rye Grass are as a consequence being more extensively grown.

Threshing operations have been commenced in some of the Southern districts, and already quantities of oats are being mar?. In this connection much correspondence with the Department is taking place relative to the Grain Prices order, 1918, which was issued during the week.

ARTIFICIAL MANURES.

The importation of potash fertilisers - a supply of which has ? specially reserved for application to the flax crop in Ireland next season - has now begun.
