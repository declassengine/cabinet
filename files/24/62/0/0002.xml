w(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRET *    I &quot;2/ WAR CABINET.G.T.5502.SITUATION OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK FORCES.Copy of telegram from War Office to General Du Cane.   .  &apos;(Circulated with reference to War Cabinet 462, Minute 3, and 463, Minute 5).Despatched 22nd August, 1918, 11 p,m.6.4854 cipher. M.0.5,For Marshal Foch from C.I.G.S. as follows:-Begins. &quot;With respect to situation in the Far&apos; East we have arrived at one of those impasses between political and military opinion which, were it not fraught with so grave dangers, would be considered ridiculous.Although they might hold different views as regards the major question of intervention in Siberia both the Allies and-President Wilson himself have for the moment an immediate and identical object, namely, to save the Czechs west of Lake Baikal.But while the whole of the competent military, authorities of the Allies are unanimously of opinion that the Czechs can be saved only by an immediate increase in numbers of the Allied troops and by the grant to the Allied Commander of a free hand as to the strategy to be employed, the President fails to realize the gravity of the military situation owing to his conviction that the Allies are endeavouring to exaggerate the danger and exploit it in order to gain their own advantages.You can readily see that in such a situation, although the resources of diplomacy are exhausted, in the event of disaster it will be no satistaction for the Allies to ascribe the massacre of a brave Ally to the President of the United States.Our only hope is that you should use your great influence with the President to induce him to withdraw his objection to Japanese intervention on. the only scale which can save us from what may be reproach for ever,Though you are fully versed in the facts of the situation, I venture to recapitulate the principal facts which I suggest should be impressed,on the President. The main strength of the enemy consists in 40,000 well armed and organized prisoners of war, whose numbers are constantly increasing, with 70 guns and 200 machine-guns. Profiting by the fact that the action of the Allies is limited by the American conditions to the Ussuri front and .to protecting .the base of Vladivostock, the enemy, as is apparent from&quot;every indication, will withdraw from that front and concentrate by the Amur&apos;Railway for the destruction of the Czechs near Lake Baikal, who there only number 4,000 or 5,000.
Owing to the number of bridges which can be destroyed, the Allies can be delayed until the enemy1s main forces Have taken Irkutsk by quite small detachments on the Manohurian and Usaur:;. front a.,    In the event of the fall of Irkutsk there ocn be no hope of saving the remainder r-f the Cheeha ve echeloned to the West, as the erjuiuy will be i&apos;ree to advance against them while delaying the Allies by rearguard actions and by destroying the railway.     If the enemy prisoners now East of Lake Baikal succeed as above they will recruit their compatriots from prison camps in Siberia and will be enabled to join the Germans advancing from the Volga.     The enemy are not the only menace   &apos;&apos;/0 the Czechs.     Latter are ill equipped and clothed, and they will inevitably succumb to the Siberian winter unless speedy assistance reaches them.At present the direct advance to the relief of the Czechs through Manchuria is limited to their tired and war-worn compatriots under General Dieclerichs., who number at the most 10,000 with few guns and possess no technical personnel for the rapid repair of bridges and the railroad.The Japanese, it is true, have sent 4,000 of their 7th Division from Manchuria to the west of Harbin to cover the concentration of Diederich&apos;s force and to protect its communication.      But these troops, owing to /onerlean opposition, cannot be used by the Japanese to assist in the advance, and for the same reason no more troops can be sent by Japan, though they arc willing and ready to send as many as may be necessary.The matter is urgent, as unless a force sufficient to ensure the defeat of the enemy, i,e. three more Japanese Divisions with the necessary technical troops, is mobilised at once, it cannot act before the end of September, when the Allies will no longer be in a position to conduct military operations.The Allied troops&apos;which have been    1    or are being landed.in Vladivostock, i,ev 12,000 Japanese, 7,000 Americans and 1,000 each of French and British, are estimated as only being sufficient to deal with the Ussuri front and ensure the safe&apos;tgr of communications,V     Ends.
