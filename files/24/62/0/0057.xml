\j jlhk Document is the Property.of His Britannic Majestys Government]CONFIDENTIAL.Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.1 i 3France /004.MEMORANDUMONTHE SOCIALIST MEETING, THE MALVY TRIAL, AND PUBLIC OPINIONIN FRANCE.A memorandum written on the 30th May (France /003) began with the question: &quot; Are the divisions among the French Socialists going to result in a definite split VNo absolutely confident answer can yet be given to that question; but recent events have made such a split much more likely. Everything that has happened in the last three months, except the Malvy trial, has emphasised the opposition between the two wings. And as the military situation improves the process is likely to go further. The urgent danger which existed in the first week in June forced all sections, both of the General Confederation of Labour and of the. Socialist party, to unite in a declaration that controversial questions were to be avoided, no obstacles placed in the way of the Government, and everything concentrated on the single thought of national defence. Against the acceptance of defeat all were agreed. But now that the situation is changed and the possibility in men&apos;s minds is no longer defeat but victory, the divergence at once reappears, and will probably go on to the end. In France, as in England, pacifism flourishes on military success; never, as in Germany, on military defeat. Directly we seem to be like winning the gulf opens between those who think first of victory and those who think first of peace; or, as M. Branting put it in a speech at Paris, between peace and right, between those who think peace more important than justice and those who think justice more important than peace; or, again, as an American labour leader has put it, between those who are for taking a short cut to a short peace and those who, being resolved on a peace that is based on principles, and promises something like a permanent settlement of the world, are prepared to go on till they get it. Both in France and in England the gulf between these two attitudes is one that cannot be bridged, because it ultimately represents opposite convictions about spiritual as well as about national and economic values; and it is likely to increase as the possibility of ending the war draws nearer.From the moment that the pressure of the German danger began to be relaxed these two forces have, in fact, been taking positions against each other. The line taken by the American labour men and, to a less degree, by Branting, about the question of an International Conference, and later, the plain words of Kerensky about the follies and crimes of the Bolshevists and the necessity of Allied interven-tion, all irritated M. Longuet and his friends, and proportionately gratified the Right Wing of the party. Throughout June and July words and acts indicated the increasing divergence. On the one hand there are two definite acts of importance. First, M. Albert Thomas decided to join the party of Socialist Deputies of the Right Wing who had formed a new group under Varenne. This was in the latter part of June. There is reason to believe that Varenne does not greatly like or trust Thomas; but that does not alter the fact that he is, on the whole, the most conspicuous man in the party, and that therefore his adherence to Varenne&apos;s group is an event of real importance. Its significance is increased by the plainness of his language then and since. He said on joining that he had done so because he wished to reconstitute the old Majority in all its strength, follow a policy of national defence, and resist an International Conference so long as the Germans, did not reply to the Allied Socialist Memorandum; and&apos; he hinted that if he and his friends could not make this policy prevail within the party, they would feel their hands free to take other action. On a subsequent occasion he talked of &quot; worn out economic formulae &quot; in a way that could not gratify the grandson of Marx. The other definite act on this side of the division was the founding of a new paper, called &quot;La France Libre,&quot; to be the organ of the new group. Its first issue appeared on the 2nd July, and announced a programme in which it declared &quot; war to the knife against all pacifist hopes as sheer fraud,&quot; and[367-37]
said its message to the authorities was: &quot;Conquer, or France will never forgiveyou.&quot;So much for the acts and words of the Right Wing. Those of the Left were equally significant of the growing division. Their chief, Longuet, applauded the Austrian Socialists&apos; reply, attacked the policy of recognising Jugo-Slav, Bohemian, and Polish independence as unnecessarily prolonging the war, and even went so far as to abuse Kerensky for his share in the brief Russian offensive of the summer of 1917. And the tone of the whole group was predominantly international and pacifist. The conflict between the two sections appeared not only in the Socialist party proper, but also in the Workmen&apos;s Congresses. At that of the railwaymen, the loyal or national party defeated the pacifists by a majority of two to one. At that of the metal workers, very bitter speeches were made, and ultimately a resolution was adopted which denounced intervention in Russia and called for an early meeting of an International Socialist Conference. This was practically a pacifist victory. Finally, on the 17th July, came the Congress of the Confederation Generate du Tra-vail, the first held since the war began. The meetings were extremely disorderly, even the Socialist &quot;Humanite&quot; describing them as &quot;degenerating into a scene of brutality&quot; ; but, after very sharp passages, majority and minority agreed to try and compromise upon a common resolution in which they ultimately succeeded, the majority giving way on nearly all points, so that the resolution said nothing about national defence, while it included &quot; no annexations or indemnities,&quot; &quot; no economic war after hostilities cease,&quot; &quot;no intervention in Russia,&quot; &quot; freedom of the seas,&quot; and a demand, coupled with threats, for passports for an &quot;International Conference.&quot; The tone of the victorious section may be seen by the fact that M. Merrheim, its leader, while declaring that they must guard against a peace of Brest, not only criticised Jouhaux, the leader of the other section and Secretary of the Confederation, for having encouraged the entry of Italy into the war, but attacked the London Inter-Allied Socialist Conference as a crime against the International. This is the more note-worthy as he was aiming at securing unity, defended Jouhaux on the whole, and used no violent language.But these Labour meetings were only the preliminaries of the struggle as it developed at the Socialist National Council which met at the end of July. It was heralded by the meeting of the large Seine Federal Council, at which Albert Thomas was attacked, and Longuet&apos;s section secured ten delegates to the Council as against only five secured by the Centre and the old Majority between them. But the Seine Council had already adopted this attitude last February when Longuet got seven delegates against three. On that occasion the old Majority were able to restore the position in the National Council, where they carried their resolution by a small majority after some sharp passages of recrimination between Thomas and Longuet.They were unable to repeat their success on this occasion. The meeting was a very orderly one, and great efforts were made to come to an agreed resolution. Renaudel, the leader of the party in the Chamber, showed himself extremely anxious to secure this result and maintain the unity of the party. He appears to be the kind of man who can be comfortably blind to real differences, provided verbal agreement can be obtained. But even that was not achieved, though Renaudel made some con-siderable concessions in the wording of his resolution; as, for instance, the con-templation in extreme circumstances, such as might arise if the party deliberately declared the Government to be Imperialist or anti-Republican, of going so far as to refuse to vote the war credits. His motion reaffirmed the attitude of the last party Congress in favour of national defence: asked for an International Congress, but only on fulfilment of the conditions of the London Memorandum; declared that the question of the passports was an International one, and that all socialist and labour parties should join together to bring to bear on their governments all the economic and political power of the working-classes, and should even, in the extreme circurm stances already mentioned, use the weapon of refusing credits. It also recognised that intervention in Russia might be useful if made by all the Allies, and not in the interest of the counter-revolution. The rival motion, that of Longuet, also declared for national defence, but with a great deal of abuse of the Governments which it asserted to have let slip offers of peace, insulted the working-classes, and ( produced nothing but military defeat. It called for an International Congress without reserves, and said nothing of the London Memorandum; demanded the use of &quot; all means &quot; for the obtaining of passports, even the refusing of credits, to wdiich it attached no conditions. It admitted of no intervention in Russia without the unanimous consent of the Russian Socialists, and vigorously denounced the action
taken by Varenne&apos;s group in connection with,the visit and attitude of the American Labour men.This resolution was carried by 1,54.4, against 1,172 given for that of Renaudel. The difference between them is one chiefly of tone : a difference which came out much mere clearly in the speeches. Longuet, for instance, declared that the war had been prolonged for imperialistic ends, and that the Soviets had the people of Russia behind them; while one of his supporters, Pressemane, even asserted that the German Socialists were nearer realities than the French, because they had not forgotten that capitalists still rule the world! Varenrie, on the other hand, frankly said, that, in view of the speeches made, he did not now believe that they could all continue to work together; and that he and his friends would follow their own course. As to the passport question, he said: &quot;You are always praising President Wilson; why not leave it to his decision?&quot; He would support RenalideFs resolution, but his group would vote the war credits whatever happened.In this way the split has begun. It is difficult to prophecy how it will develop. The next stage is the meeting of the National Congress of the whole party, in which the ultimate sovereignty, as it were, resides. The National Council which has just met is an assembly of delegates from the local bodies, whose duty it is to watch or control the C.A.P. (Commission Administrative Permanente), or Executive Committee of the party. The Congress will meet in a few weeks. To that both parties in the recent struggle make their appeal. Renaudel and the official &quot; Humanite&quot; continue &quot;their efforts for unity. But the probabilities seem against success. On the one hand, Longuet and his friends claim that the vote does not represent anything like their real superiority in the party, and demand a change in its ruling executive; while some of their extremists declare that they want peace quickly, and would not delay it one hour for the sake of Italia irredenta or even for Alsace-Lorraine. On the other hand, Thomas advocates &quot; frankness without caring about conciliatory expressions,&quot; declares that artificial union built on concessions would be useless; while anonymous Socialists of the same wing declare that all honest supporters of the Wilsonian peace must be &quot; jusqu&apos;auboutistes,&quot; because the cause of the war is not capitalism or Clemenceau but Prussian despotism, which only victory and no International Congress can overcome.Language of this kind on both sides does not look like unity. The two sections have not really got their eyes fixed on the same things. One is thinking of Socialism and the class war; the other of France. The one is not at heart Nationalist at all; it cares for the improvement of working-class conditions and for little else; and it is bent on an International Conference, largely because of the pro-digious advertisement such a Conference might bring to the Socialist cause. Peace is not in its eyes the deliverance of France, but the necessary preliminary condition to a new social and economic order. The other section holds that an even more necessary condition is the defeat of German militarism, and that no half-defeat will do. The one is a prisoner of the Marxist tradition, which sees all questions through * economic spectacles. The other, while insisting on industrial and economic changes, realises that a nation is something more than a mere economic unit, that freedom is a value that cannot be expressed in wages, and that the soul and body of France, to the making of which ten or twelve centuries have been given, were made to play a part in the world which no class but only a nation can play, and that it would be &quot;treachery to the past and future of the world, as well as of France, to sink her identity in any International.If this is a fair account of the rival tendencies it is hard to see how they can permanently work together. Perhaps the open and final split would have come now but for the rally towards unity caused by the Malvy trial. On this subject not only all the Labour and Socialist organisations, but ali the forces of the Extreme Left agree. Most of them have made public pretests against the judgment, and these come from the Socialists of the Right Wing, as, for instance, those who write in the &quot;France Libre,&quot; as well as from the Centre and the Left. And there is no doubt that the somewhat extraordinary position taken up by the Senate, which even so moderate a paper as the &quot;Debats &quot; denounces as appearing to claim for itself the right to invent crimes and their penalty at its own sovereign will, has given natural ground for alarm. And it would seem to have been very bad policy on the part of the prosecution ever to criticise Malvy&apos;s friendly relations with Labour and Socialist organisations. It would have been much wiser, if less gratifying to reactionary Senators, if the case had been kept most narrowly on the ground of the protection Malvy clearly gave to a number of men since proved to have been criminals or traitors.
The whole trial was made too political for English taste; and the case fcr the judg-ment is not in our eyes improved by the admission in such a paper as the &quot; Debats &quot; that it was partly due to the fear of weakening M. Clemericeau by an acquittal. The defenders of Malvy are, in our eyes, equally away from the true issue when they insist on the friendliness of Malvy&apos;s attitude to the working-classes, find imply that that justifies his obstructions of the course of justice and protection of criminals.It is very difficult for a foreigner, and probably even for a Frenchman, to judge whether the trial will or will not ultimately have, much political effect. It is natural enough that party spirit should exploit the small majorities by which the judgment was passed, the complete refutation of the graver charges and the tributes paid to Malvy, not only by the three Prime Ministers under whom he served, but by General Nivelle, to create the impression that the whole affair is simply the sacrifice of an innocent patriot to reactionary spite and the animosity of M. Clemenceau.But, on the other hand, Malvy, though he conducted his defence with skill and dignity, has never been a popular or interesting figure, and is not an easy man to rally round. And, whatever efforts may be made to turn the whole affair into politics, nothing can permanently conceal the fact that the trial showed Malvy over and over again as the protector of every kind of &quot;undesirable,&quot; from pacifist agitators and deserters to proved traitors like Goldsky, who is already serving a sentence in prison, and Duval, who has already been shot. He seems never to have assisted, and often to have obstructed, the attempts to suppress them. When the-police were watching Lipscher&apos;s attempts; to get into relations with Caillaux he warned Caillaux; and he seems to have said nothing to his colleagues, and tried to stifle the affair. The instances of this attitude are far too numerous to be accidental. And they cannot fail to influence the mind of the public, especially that large and important section of it which cares little for the politicians and much for France. The army especially is said to feel that whether Malvy is guilty or not, it would be a scandal if he escaped, for when soldiers get mixed up with traitors they are not sent to live in a good hotel in Spain; they are shot. And part of M. Clemenceau&apos;s immense popularity with them is due, not only to his coming constantly among them as no other Minister has done, but to their feeling that he is a man who is afraid of no one, and will strike at Malvy or Caillaux just as willingly as he would at a soldier found guilty of being a spy or a deserter. In that way the condemnation of Malvy and the approaching trial of Caillaux have a democratic side to them.On the whole, if the war continues to go well the Malvy agitation will probably collapse. There is no evidence that it arouses any great interest except among politicians who hope to turn it to political use. There was no important demonstra-tion when he left Paris to go into exile. It is not easy to be certain, but there is reason to believe that the Extreme Left are putting their money on the wrong horse in backing Malvy, who may soon be forgotten, and Pacifism, which grows every clay less popular as the day of victory seems to draw visibly nearer. The country is thinking about the deeds of the army, not about the intrigues of the politicians. Victory weakens the opposition and strengthens Clemenceau. Without victory the Malvy business, which was certainly not well managed, might have clone him harm; with victory he is once more and more than ever all-powerful, for the reason that he is seen to be what a Socialist Senator called him just before Malvy&apos;s condemnation, &quot; the incarnation of the soul of France.&quot; And his power is further increased by the age and diminished authority of the Chamber. Re was never the choice of Parlia-ment but of the country as a whole, and that he still has its support may be judged by the resolutions of confidence in him which have just been passed by those very important bodies, the Conseils Generaux, which are probably the best of all repre-sentatives of provincial opinion.0P.S. Since the above was written fresh evidence has arrived of the extent of the split. In the issue of the &quot;Humanite&quot; for the 21st August Thomas has an article insisting that the refusal of war credits ought not to be made either an answer to the refusal of passports or a weapon of political opposition. He will vote the credits, even if he has to oppose M. Clemenceau. In the same issue Pressemane declares that it would be a &quot; hypocrisy &quot; for him and his political friends to remain tied up a day longer with Thomas and Varenne. The attitude which they have adopted is one with which he and those who think with him cannot possibly come to terms or accept any compromise.
