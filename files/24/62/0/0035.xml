dows/986. WAR CABIJgT, \\)$,&apos;   1% Pejnsions of Officers&apos; WidgJ&amp;s*c c \ c* Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War;Remarks on Fote &quot;by Mr* Chamberlain (G.T,547l) and on observations thereon by the Minister of Pensions, (G8T,550G),I agree with the Minister of tensions that there is no case for (a) increasing the Ordinary&apos; pensions of officers&apos; widows, for (b) any general revision of the pensions granted in the past to the widows of those whose deaths were due to war service or military duty, or for (c) re-classifying past cases under the altered categories now ruling.But the reason which led the War Office to propose to the Select Committee of 1914/15 that  100 should be taken as tho minimum figure for an officers widow&apos;s highest rate1 pension-, was not the greatest element of chance in promotion to Captain, but the feeling that in the New Army there was no substantial difference between the claims or needs of the widow of a subaltern and a captain, and that *100 should be regarded as an over-riding minimum for this purpose.I consider that ^highest rate&apos; pensions of POO given in former wars - they were confined to cases killed in action or dying of wounds received in action - should be raised to    100 just as soldiers1 widows&apos; pensions have been raised to the nov-minimum^28th August, 1918.
