C^tfl&apos; brM^,sr\ JRAOTAYjm:rS VKAH WAGES. 4 M)0-5 * ^        ....................... U8Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Shortly after the war began the two principal Railway ftrade Unions met the Railway Companies and entered into a truce for the period of the war.   Under this no questions as to wages were to be raised but owing to the increase in the cost of living this agreement has not been kept in its entirety and a war bonus has been given.   The first war bonus was 3/- a week to men receiving less than 30/- a week and 2/- to men receiving 30/- and over. This bonus was given in February 1915 and has since been altered on sweral occasions.   The first alteration was to a flat rats of 5/- a week all round,   later the war bonus was increased to 10/- and subsequently to 15/- and in August last year the 15/* was altered from being a war bonus to a war wage, so that it was taken into account in calculating the earnings of men who work overtime or on Sunday.    later in 1917 the war wage of 15/- was increased to 21/- and in the spring of this year a farther 4/- was given, making 85/- in all.   The average earnings of a railwayman before the war were 28/6 and the 25/- increase in war wage represents an increase of 88$. but the actual percen-tage inorease varies very muoh according to the different grades of men.   For example, a fireman receiving from 4/- to 4/9 a day would earn in a week 24/- to 27/-, excluding overtime and a 25/-increase is therefore a percentage increase of 92j to 104$.   A driver earning from 6/- to 8/3 a day would earn in 6 days, again excluding overtime, from 36/- to 51/- and his percentage inorease therefore varies only from 49 to 69-^.   Passenger guards and goods guards who receive from 25/- to 35/- a week on the Bame assumption would receive a percentage increase of 70 toThe Railway Unions have again approached the Railway Companies to put forward additional demands.   The Associated Society of locomotive Engineers and Firemen ask for an increase of 10/- a week but the national Union of Railwaymen do not ask for any specific amount.   The grounds on which they ask for an increase are1.   Increased oost of living. *2.   The recent Award of the Committee on Production withregard to the engineering and foundry trades. 3.   Increased bonus given to the miners.As regards (1) the cost of food has advanced from 106 f0 above July 1914 at which it stood when the last increase in the war wage was granted to 118$ at the present time and on these figures alone it would seem that there is some Justification for increasing the war wage.The second ground referred to is the additional 3/6 awarded by the Committee on Production to men employed in engineering shops.   These men already had a war wage of 20/- together with &amp; bonus of l%Wo on all earnings.   The recent Award increased tho war wage to 23/6 am*: the bonus of 12-^ on all earnings remains.   It is understood that it may be taken that the general effect of the 23/6 together with the IZtyfo is a total inorease of from 30/- to 31/-.   This increase of 3/6 has been given in some of tho Railway Companies&apos; shops and will undoubtedly extend/ to the rest of them and many of the men in the shops are members of tho National Union of Railw-aymon who will be receiving a larger increase than the men in tho same Union employed on tho lino,(1)
though in the case of men working overtime, the war wage of 25/-. represents an aotual inoreaso of between 128/- and 29/-,There is not so much force in the third ground set out, namely tho increased bonus recently given to the miners.   Thia was a bonus of 1/6 per day on the top of a similar bonus given&apos; last year, that is, a total increase of 3/- a day.   All miners, however, had received considerable increases since the war began in consequence of the working of the sliding scale arrange-ments under which wages go up as price of coal goes up, but when an increase of 1/6 a day was demanded by the miners, one of the grounds they advanced was that it would put them on an equality with what had been done for the railwaymen.Another disturbing element may have been the rapid increase in wages given to men on the Railway Companies&apos; steamers, who now receive a wage fixed by the National Maritime Board for ordinary seamen at 71/6 per week, an increase over their pre-war earnings of about 130^,The Hallway Executive Committee, who acting on behalf of the Government have already been in negotiation&quot;with the Unions, point out that on the grounds of present cost of living th^re is no justification for any substantial increase in the war wage, and therefore, if it is thought desirable that some increase should be given, it must be upon some other grounds. In view of the fact that some of the recent Awards and increases that have been given to other trades appear to have been given for some other reason than the increased cost of living, I cannot help thinking that some concession to the railwaymen should be made.   It is difficult to say what increase should be allov/ed, but I do not think that a settlement can be effected for a smaller increase than 3/- a week, and it may be more,   I should like to put on record that the railwaymen have been, and are, working exceedingly well, and that tbey have dealt successfully with a largely increased traffio, both passenger and goods, although the staff itself has been greatly reduced owing to the number of men that have been released for nllitary service.29th August, 1913,
