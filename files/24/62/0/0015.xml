ssis &apos; mum,As I was unfortunately prevented by illness from being present when ?ar Aims were discussed in the Cabinet, I desire to place my views on record.I a.;ree that the sooner a Meeting of the Allies can be arranged in order to have a full discussion on v/ar Aims the better.:   conditions have changed and reconsideration seems to be necessary.    But before this step is talien it is ob-viously essential that we should be agreed upon our own view.I do not share the opinion expressed in some quar-ters that Pacifism is spreading, or that the People are tired of the War in the sense that they would surrender on questions of vital importance to the Empire if they were made fully ac-quainted with them,    I hesitate to express an opinion upon the Military aspect of the situation but I believe that we can and shall defeat the Enemy decisively on the Western front, and that when this has been achieved the other Llnemies will collapse.I regard the refusal to allow the Greraan Colonies to return to Germany as absolutely vital to the retention of our African iilmpire, to the good government and progress of the Natives, and indeed to the Peace of the ^/orld.    I do not believe in a Condominium, the example of the New Hebrides is dead against the success of this policy.  But I would offer no objection to the suggestion that the United States of Anerica should be asked&apos; to take some share in the future government of German ^ast Africa, if she is willing, and a working plan can be found.     As regards the Pacific, I am convinced any attempt to surrender the Islands now in our possession would provokeviolent
violent opposition in Australia and Hew Zealand and would be accompanied by immense dangers to those two groat Sister Nations, and might even strain their loyalty to breaking point.I would like to suggest that special Maps should be prepared with the assistance of the Admiralty and the War Office, showing the importance of all the German Colonies to us, the advantages of their return to Germany in Submarine Bases, Wireless Stations, Depots for coal and oil, and the consequent power she would possess to attack our Trade Routes. I would send these maps to President Wilson, of course through our Ambassador, to the Allies, and to the Governments of the Dominions and Crown Colonies.I would also like to see the true facts of the case brought clearly before our people at home by special and carefully prepared propaganda.In conclusion I will only say I believe this War, with all its glorious sacrifices will have been fought in vain, and that future generations will never forgive us, if we allow the pen to lose wh*t the sword has won,, I.I-LL.248.18.
