Taking the price to the grower at yS2.20,  this represents 73/4d. per quarter of 480 lbs., or 77/- per quarter of 504 lbs.For a comparison with the suggested grain prices, therefore, it seems fair to take 77/- as the average price realised by the American Farmer.Re HEHBY HEW,        uStatistical Department,Board of Agriculture. 24. 8. 1918.

COST OF GROWING AN ACHE OP WHEAT.The following schedule sets out a number of the most trustworthy estimates the Board of Agriculture have been able to obtain of the cost of growing an acre of wheat in 1917, together with some figures for the pre-war period for comparison. The figures are based upon actual recent costs with such additions as the present price of labour and materials call for. The estimate made by the technical committee to which reference has been made was M 7 s. Qd. for the season 191(5. Adjusted for the increased cost of labour, &amp;c, in 1917, and for a share in the rotation expenses which was not included in the original estimate, it constitutes No.- 4 in the Table.It must be pointed out that all such estimates of the cost of growing a single crop in a rotation are subject to the uncertainty attaching to the share that the crop should be called upon, to pay of the cost of the cleaning crop in the rotation, of the farmyard manure the efect o( which lasts throughout the rotation, and of bare fallows, failures of crop, and similar irregular contingencies. On many wheat-growing farms the farmer does not expect any return from the root and grass crops in the rotation the receipts from the corn crops have to pay tor the whole rotation. The cost per quarter of wheat depends upon the yield per acre : the figures for the two Eastern Counties that were given on July 19, 1917, are based on the expectation that in 1917 the average yield will be no better than the 3^ qr. per acre obtained in 1916. The average yield will probably be less than this if account is taken of the land sown with wheat that had to be ploughed up or mended with barley.Lastly, these are costs incurred by skilful farmers working on a considerable scale, who alone are in the habit of keeping records. They arc not average costs, and though in some respects the smaller and poorer farmer may spend less because he does not cultivate so thoroughly, any saving in this respect is likely to be compensated for by less economical use of labour and horses, and the average cost of production is probably higher than these figures would indicate.	1913.*	1917.	1917.		1917.		1917.		1917.	1917.

Estimate; of the. Coat of Growing, Wheat after Roots,in 1916-17 andUl7-l6. &apos;Notes:   In these calculations the following daily rates have bttn taken for wages tuid norso labour:-Man	Horse3/7 d	4/6d3/lOd	5/-4/1 d	6/6d4/6d	6/6d5/3d	V-autumn 1916 Spring 1917 Autumn 1917 Spring 1918 Autumn 1918 .The average rates for harvest wages have been taken as:-1916-17 - 8/14;     1917-18 - 10/od.The estimates assume land of medium texture and moderate quality growing a crop of 4 qurs, per acre.     It is supposed to form part of a 300-acre farm of which 200 acres are in tillage and 100 acr^s under corn crops.     In the case of horse labour it is assumed that the animal works about 210-220 days in the year; men arc supposed to be employed for 313 days,     In various cir-cumstances it would be necessary to add from 5 to 10 per cent to the wages bill, to allow for broken time.    As the crop is grown after roots, the autumn cultivations arc rather less than they would be after other crops, and if two ploughing were necessary instead of one, the cost would be increased by about lb/- in 1916-17 und 18/- in 1917-18.1916-17 1917-18    s.   d.           s.   d.Autumn CultivationsPloughing, Harrowing, Drilling       1    2   - 16-Sprintf CultivationsHarrowing, Rolling, Weeding11   - 14   6Harvesting   .Cutting, Carting, Stacking,Thatching. 1    6   -        1   12MarketingThreshing, Dressing, Carting, 16   6 1    13Seed and seed Dressing 1     - - 1Manure (including application) 2   10 - 3    - -Share of Cost of Cleaning      * 17 * &apos;     1    - -Rent and Rates 1   10 - .     1   10 -Insurances 3 a. 3 -Bailiff 6 6 8 -Fencing, Ditching, Roads ) 8 - 10 -Minor Repairs to Buildings)Depreciation and Upkeep of ) 3 - 6 6 Implements          *            )Interest on Capital (other thanhorses) 10 - , 10 -Total (per acre) 11   4   .     413    4
