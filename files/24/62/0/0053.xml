St is now possible for the first time to mate oceiparisons with the&apos;corresponding month of last year for a number of oea* modi ties, of whi*ch the  limpOrta&apos;previously to July 1917 were un* oertain owing to tho e*cluel6n oT Government-ewnet goods (exoept food) from tho Trade Returns.   The  following points maybe   . noted , In July 191b imports of grain and flour wore down 66$ as against July  1917,  This large fall was, ho we Tor. duo to the axooptional efforts to reconstitute our grain stores in the ; summer of last year. As compared with 1916 the fall amounted to Tory oaoh leas, Meat imports as against July 1917 wore up sons 35%.   Iron ore was up ZGfc imports  of timber and of payer-making wterials wsra both somewhat reduced. Raw wool was down 63$.   But raw ootton was up 69$*3. fetal exports in July amounted to 3,440,000 tons, whichIs 16$ he low the figure  for July 1917,    Coal exports amounted to 3,044,000 tons, or 10$ less than in July, 1917,  Host imports manufactures shew a reduction in tonnage on July 1917 ** iron and steal of 444 cotton manufactures of 33$ and 1 other textllos1 of 36$*    Wool mtsxtaotures, however, shewotea Increase of19$. .4. while imports in ^uly were down 44$ on 1913 the entrancesof British and  foreign vessels (with cargo) were down 54$; and while Imports were down 1 $ on 1917 tonnage ontraaoes were down 11$,  Thus, as against 1913 the loading faster Is  1$ ffiatii5 em as egainst 1917 If iw45, In &apos;July British entrances with cargo amounted to 1,not tons, that Is&apos;6$ less than in July 1917,  British clearances were 1,368,000&apos;- 18$ loss than in July 1917,  ^orai^a entrances amounted to  64,000 tons, 33$ less than in July 1917 - ajsd foreign clearances to 633,000 tons, 21% less than in Jaly 1917.Judy total losses of British shipping, of over 600 GUT. amount ad to&apos; 188,000 gross tone  of which 177,000 tons were dne to my risk, as against a total lose&apos; in June of 192,000 tons. Britisivbuilt vessels brought into eervioe amounted to 140,000 tons, and total gains, including purchasod and requisitioned vessels,   to 160,000 tons.  On this side, also, the  position f is suhetantially the same as it was in Jane,  In each month thototeO. gains haw boon about 30,000 tons below the total losses,7, War losses of the Allies (other than British) in July were71;000 tons as against 62,000 tons in June, and of neutrals 26,000 tons as against 39,000 tons in June*   The average of world war losses to .T3riti3h; Allied and Heutrala combined  ever the first seven months   of i918 amount to a littlo under 300,000 tons a month,(1)
On toe 30th*- tho figure for July 31st % is net yet available    as compared with May 31st. the   employment   of tho British Mercantile   steam fleet ever 500 tone had changed as follows:-99Vessels repairing and surveying Launched hut not completedTotal of the  ah oreArmy and Wavy Colonies(Russia Allies (U-S.A(Other Permanently abroad OilersRemainder available for British trade tther than OilersTotal ready for useGRANT?

The tonnage given as employed by the Ansy and Havy includes 145,000 engaged in carrying titrates.    .9hese vessels have never previously been shewn separately.The table  below gives tho  absolute and the percentage increases and decreases of vessels over 600 tens that ha^ taken place between June 30th* 1917 and June 30th. 1918 in the several employments ofRepairing and Surveying Launched but not completedTetal:-Army &amp; Navy Oolonies(Russia Allies    H7.S.A.(Other Permanently abroad OilersEemainder available for tr. , trade other than oilers.Tetal ready for useGRAND TOTALjyggO tensl mf.   33f 677- 731- 412 *i 336 4* 210 I 323 i 0^ f 134- 6G0-1,581&quot;*1,004Percentage E&apos;    9tmm25 46 9828 7 14-   10-   10
It will be noted that 07/ing to tho Increase in vessels undergoing repair and in vessels launched but not completed, a redu&amp;tion tf 6$ in the tetal tn the register has meant a reduction in tonnage fit for service of as much ae 10$.     (The great reduction in the tonnage in use for Russia and the great increase in that in use for the united States are brought tut clearly in t&amp;e  Table,    $he decline in tonnage (other than oilers) of vessels available for United Kingdom trade works out at 10$ 0    In consequence, however,   of statistical uncertainties duo to changes in the method of classification, no great stress  ean be  laid on this figure.10%  he following table shows the position of Britishshipbuilding as reported during the week; ending let August 191B.Standard shipsOther Merchant vesselsOilersS3CS3 TOKKAGfj?Wader oen-struotion&apos; on stocks.IMMWMMfMMIM709;000 se?;oeo860.000Xtaunohtd but not qoarpletod1X8:000 1S9J000tgotalunder ooiv struction687;000 636;000  90,000The tonnage under construction on stocks included 97 overseas bargee totalling 44;000 tone.
