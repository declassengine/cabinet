No. 187.

Allied Naval Council,

Admiralty, S.W.,

2nd September, 1918.

Sir,

I am directed by the Allied Naval Council to inform you that the following communication on the above subject has been made by them to the Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council at Versailles:-

"The Allied Naval Council understand that the Army on the "Albanian front has withdrawn towards Valona to the Malakastra - "Chafa Gl? - Chafa Glumaka line.

"The security of Valona is of vital importance to the "operations of the Allied Navies in the Adriatic and for this "reason it appears probable that the enemy may attempt to "dominate or secure that base. If the Allies lose effective "possession of Valona the whole of the naval operations in the "Lower Adriatic against enemy submarines will be seriously "prejudiced; the efficiency of the mobile barrage in the "Otranto Straits will be much impaired and the completion of "the fixed barrage now in progress and the mine barrages in "contemplation will be rendered difficult if not impossible.

"The Allied Naval Council are informed by their Italian "Colleagues that effective measures have already been taken by "Italy, and it is understood that certain Military reinforcements have already been despatched, but the Council desire to "impress strongly upon the Supreme War Council and the Military "Representatives the importance which is attached to Valona from the Naval point of view, which will continually increase "as the barrage operations in progress and projected proceed, "and to urge that the necessary Military measures may be taken "to prevent the enemy from making any advance against Volona."

The Members of the Allied Naval Council have also made direct representations on these matters to their respective Governments.

I am, Sir,

Your obedient Servant,

(Signed) T.E. CREASE.

Captain, Royal Navy.

Secretary.

The Liaison Officer,

Supreme War Council,

2 Whitehall Gardens,

S.W.1.
