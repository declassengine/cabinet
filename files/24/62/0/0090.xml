C&apos;lAvfTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAEBIC MAJESTY&apos;S 00^ WAR cabinet.        Committee of Home AffairsG.T.5590  I INCREASE IN QUANTITY OF BEER.Memorandum by Lord D&apos;Abecnon.&apos;The question of an increase of the available quantity of beer has been raised by a letter of August 9th from the Parlia-mentary Agent of the Licensed Victuallers&apos; Defence Leaguer&quot; 12   It may be well to put on record my views on this matter.The Central Control Board have always held that an inadequate supply of liquid refreshment involved considerable danger to temperance in that it leads to &quot;rush&quot;      hi:ing and makes consumers inclined to drink to excess during the uncertain and brief periods when a full supply can be obtained by them.There is also abundant evidence that shortage of beer drives the public to spirits.- It would, therefore, seem that consider-able advantage would result from an increase jf the present, allow-ance of beer by a further amount of two or three million barrels of a fixed gravity between 10.23 and 3 0,25.An increased amount of beer of suitable strength sold at suitable prices, so far from being dangerous to temperance would be, within certain limits, beneficial to it,   It would also dimin-ish the irritation now felt by the working classes at the absence of adequate supplies.   Although the Cential Control Board ia not responsible for this deficiency, a certain amount of the unpopularity caused by shortage is reflected upon the Boazd^ restrictions and diminishes the readiness with which the public conform to them.It is obviously undesirable and unfair that the severerestriction of hours imposed by the Board should be aggravatedby the fact that on many days refreshment is not available, even during the restricted houra.Comparing the gravity proposed (10*23 to 10.25) with that current before the war, vis 10.54 average, it is to be noted that the same amount of materials would, under the proposed conditions, produce more than double the amount of liquid refreshment. On the other hand, since the fact of dilution decreases the rate of absorption of alcohol, the intoxicating effect of the beer consumed at the weaker strength now proposed would be consider-ably les3 than half the intoxicating effect which the same amount Of beer would have had at 10.54.     It would, indeed, be a procedure of some difficulty to get drunk.on beer of the strength suggested.   This will be realized from the following comparison:-It may be estimated that an ordinary man weighing .10 stone would require to drink nearly six pints of 10.24 beer in order to reach a concentration of *1% of absolute alcohol in the blood, which is usually considered the danger line of dt*uhkenness.Alternatively, making a very moderate allowance for the increased toxicity of the more concentrated dose, he could reach the same stage of euphoria through whisky at 30 u,p. by an absorption of two large glasses - a much more expeditions route-- involving the consumption of one quarter of a pint of liquid a3 compared with six pints.
mmI am of the opinion that the discontent now occasioned &quot;by     pjl the restriction on supply and gravity of beer is due more to the I,.! scarcity and uncertainty of supplies than to the low gravity of   I;J the beer, to which the public will soon become accustomed. If the bulk supply of beer could be increased now and at suitable i opportunities in the future without any appreciable raising of the gravity, it Jc probable that such a policy would do much to reconcile the publia to existing restrictfione against excessive    1 drinking.   Thus a permanent reform of immense national importance J would be facilitated, and one of the most difficult problems of the reconstruction period   be overc&amp;ican*.*^ad)      D*AHERN01f,September 2/1918.
