The Clerical Party consists of representatives of the Roman Catholic population and of the orthodox Protestants (Calvinists).The Queen has on this occasion applied to the Catholics. Their leader, Mgr. Nolens, haying &quot;been unable to form a complete Cabinet, the hutch Minister to the Vatican, Jonltheer van Rispen tot Sevenaer, was summoned home, and, notwithstanding his weak state of health, was invited to take over the Foreign Office and probably also to become Prime Minister.It has been here and there asserted that the appointment ef ran Rispen would mean that the new Cabinet would be ,7a Mini-stry for the preparation of peace&apos;1 and that van Rispen&apos;s re-lationa with the Vatican would in this connection be expected to stand him in good stead.Cslya has also been approached but has declined.     The name of M. Ruijs de Beerenbronck, Commissioner of the Queen at Limburg, is likewise mentioned.Professor Jlemeyer, of the University of Le yd en (Professor of Economic Geography) who visitea the P.I.D. yesterday seemed fully to expect a preponderatingly Catholio Ministry.    The three great parties in the Chamber, the Conservative Clericals, the liberals and the Socialists, are approximately balanced as a result ef the elections.The Catholic masses in the Southern bovinees of Holland/are
are mostly pro-Ally, an they have seen the sufferings of the Belgians under the German yoke and have heard accounts of them from thousands of refugees.    The higher clergy is, aooor&amp;ing to Professor Memoyer, to a man pro-German.    M. Nolens and Jonkheer van Rispen are likewise pro-German.
