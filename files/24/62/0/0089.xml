I. 5542 to trace men through the army records from nominal rolls supplied.by the Ministry of National Service of men recruited in the last quota would be a very slow and unsatisfactory oro cess.-In the case of men &quot;serving at home it was&apos; decided that the bast course was for the/machinery no1.; in existence to bo retained and developed to secure the release &apos;of such numbers and grades as are authorised.    Briefly -this is:-Hinors are informed that if willing to return &quot;to the mines they should apply for A.F.W.39S0;Which&apos;is then sent &quot;on to miners1 Agent who interviews previous employer - or other employe where.previous employer does not wish&apos; to ro-ongago man and return form to CO.Unit and ma., is then released.   This is being supplemented by Muster Parades. &apos;&apos;-&apos;-&apos;-In tho case of men serving Overseas, it was decided that the most offestive method of arranging releases would be fa)    To ostablish a Central Committee- at the base representing the Army and the Coal Controller. This Committoo would supervise the work of(b)    a representative or representatives of the CoalController who would be attached say to each Corps H.%\ or analogous formation and would work in conjunction with.military Officers in   proving miners sent for(release from the Units in such Coros or formation.
Any man accepted by the Coal Controller&apos;s representatives with a Corps, etc. would be dispatched to the Discharge Centre at Ripon for transfer to Class ?. Resyrve.

The Coal Controller stated that he was prepared to take Category A and B.?. men as industrially equivalent to Grade 1, but in assessing men lower than Category B.?. five such men must be treated as equal to 3 Grade I. He desire? again to place on record that in his opinion that unless the requisite number of men were found by the middle of next month, the position would be very serious.

The Admiralty representative intimated that miners employed as stokers would not be released unless the number of ships in commission was reduced.

The ? Ministry representative intimated that Aviation Candidates and technical men could not be released.

The War Office representative pointed out that any wholesale release of the recruits from the last mining quota would deplete the reserves of the Guards and the Machine Gun Corps to such an extent as to upset the whole of their drafting arrangements. Releases should be confined as far as possible to men recruited before 1918 and to pre-war miners and priority should be given to the men who had been longest in the Army. Release to be contingent on man&apos;s willingness to return to the Mines.

Releases from overseas should include men in categories B.i. and B.ii; and the Army should be at liberty to make up the total from these Grades provided this could be done within the time laid down by The War Cabinet, and provided the ratio of fitness agreed by the Coal Controller was adhered to.

The Conference was of the opinion that if the War Cabinet decided upon the release of more miners, the total number to be released should be settled in terms of Grade I men, such total to be divided as equitably as possible based on the number of miners posted to the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively during the last 12 months. The Ministry of National Service would ascertain this proportion.

If rapidity of release is alone to be considered the quickest method would be to release from men in Home ?nits.
