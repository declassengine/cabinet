ty of! merit.Grain Prices for 1918 Harvest,\,Notes by the food Controller on $armors Profits and on v/ British and American Prices. hall %W1,   The Home Affairs Committee has a3Iced for (A) data showing the effect on the farmer&apos;s profits of the existing prices and the proposed prioeB and (B) comparable prices for oereals in tho United States and in this Country.2.    The framing of an estimate of the costs of wheat production is a task of notorious difficulty for the following amoag   other reasons(a) The costs vary as between one field and another, one farm and another, and more particularly cno season and another.(b) Trustworthy data are lacking.    Only a small percentage of farmers keep any accounts worthy of the name and still fewer keep them in such a way as to be able to make a separate lodger aooount of cereal cultivation.   A deputation from the Agricultural Advisory Council which conferred with the Home Cereals Committee   on the grain prices order was a&amp;ked for definite information as to farming costs but has not been able to provide it.(o) The wheat crop is part of a rotation covering four or five years.   Tho crops of tho whole rotation are so interlaced that it is a matter of extreme difficulty to separate tho costs of any one crop.3.   MAy realising these difficulties my Agricultural Advisers have attempted an estimate of the cost of producingA.ffA&amp;TOS&apos;, PH0?IT-1-tho/
p 3the 1916 wheat crop.    This estimate is based on their extensive personal experience both of growing wheat and of valuing crops. In their opinion a quite liberal-estimate of the cost per acre of the production of wheat this year is  12*12-6 after a bare fallow and  12-3-0 after clover ley.      The details of these estimates are set out in Appendix A.4.   Land cultivated in accordance with these estimatesshould produce this year an average crop of 4j quarters to theacre.    The gross return will then be:4:o quarters of wheat ataverage price of 75/7 *......    17Spending value of straw   .......      1 18This gives the farmer a net return of  5-7-6 per acre after hare falloi/ and  5-17-0 after clover ley.    Either of these sums represents a fair margin of profit sufficient to meet such charges as management, interest and depreciation in machinery.5,.   It is my Agricultural Advisors1 considered opinion that with the prices offered in my memorandum of the 16th instant the farmer will, in consequence of the superiority of this year&apos;s crops over those of 1917, be quite as well off as last year notwithstanding any increase which has taken place in the cost of production.   As practically no complaints of last year&apos;s prices were received by the Ministry of Food, I claim that farmers were satisfied with the profits which they made,B, British and American Wheat Prices.6*   Maximum Prices (Cereal Year 1917-18)In this country the Grain Prices Order 1917 fixed a maximum price for all qualities of wheat on a sliding scalebeginning/-2-
beginning at 73/6 and rising to 77/9 per quarter of 504 lbs. according to the date of delivery of the wheat.      The unweighted average of the prices in this scale is 75/7 per 504 lbs.In the United States the maximum price pail to the American farmer for highest grade wheat works out at 72/5 per 504   lbs.7. Prices actually paid (Oereal Year 1917-18.)In England and Wales according to the reports of Inspectors of Corn Returns the average price of home grown wheat wa3 76/2 per 504 lbs.In the United States according to the monthly crop report of tho Department of Agriculture the average price received by producers works out at 72/2 per 504 lbs.Puller details showing how these prices are arrived at are given in Appendix B to this Memorandum.Ministry of Food. 27th August, 1918,J.R.
