--Ql4iis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]&apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1918.SECRET. NOTF. OX THE EQUIPMENT&apos; OF THE AMERICAN ARMY IN 1919.I CIRCULATE a brief account of the proposals which we have now made to the United States Government for aiding them with, artillery, and of the reasons governing our action.W. S. CHURCHILL.September 2, 1918.One of the principal problems considered at the recent meeting of the Inter-A Hied Munitions Council in Paris is the possibility of equipping with artillery and ammunition the large number of divisions which the American Government propose to put into the field before next midsummer.Mr. Stettinius, the representative of the War Department, brought forward a programme on the basis of 80 divisions in Europe by the end of next June, and raised the question whether, so large a programme was beyond the bounds of possibility from the point of view of artillery equipment and ammunition supply.The view put forward on behalf of Great Britain was that artillery equipment could not in any circumstances be considered to rule out this scheme for two main reasons : 1. &quot;On grounds of military policy. 2. On grounds of supply.As regards the first point it was suggested to the American representative that if so large an American force as 80 divisions is put into the field, it will no longer be essential to equip both the old and the new divisions with the same establishment of artillery per division as is necessary with a much smaller number of units in the field. When the British Army was at full strength an establishment of 48 field guns per division was associated with 13,000 bayonets; this same number are now associated with 8,000 or 9,000 bayonets, while in the American Army it is proposed to associate this same field artillery with 17,000 bayonets.On every front and in every army the number of guns in action, in proportion to the number of men in the front line, has varied very greatly from time to time. Under the most unfavourable circumstances there will be more artillery on the Western front next year than this year,and there is almost no limit to the number of men that could be utilised with this artillery. It may be highly desirable from the point of view of organisation to retain a minimum number of guns in association with each division, but in the last resource the number of guns that must be used on the front is a function of the number of miles of offensive front and defensive front respectively, rather than of the number of divisions in France.Similar considerations are even more true of ammunition than of the actual guns themselves. If the number of divisions in the field has largely increased, an increasing proportion of them for considerable periods of the year will be behind the line in reserve and their guns will not be firing. Moreover, on the defensive part of the line, the quantity of ammunition fired will be determined rather by the work to be done in keeping down hostile batteries, &amp;c, than by the number of firing points available.For these reasons it was suggested that a given increase in men can be effectively employed with a smaller increase in the number of guns and a still smaller increase in the actual tonnage of ammunition fired on the whole Allied front.It is, however, natural that before deciding on their increased programme of divisions, the Americans should wish to be satisfied that they will have an adequate equipment of artillery.   The French, who were prepared to see them through this year
on their 30-division programme, cannot hope to cope with this much bigger increase. Their supplies will not be sufficient to equip the 48 divisions expected to be in France by the 31st December, and the deficiency will be much greater by 30th June. The United States production will hardly help at all before the end of this year, and will only meet the deficiency next year on the most optimistic forecasts. As production has not yet begun in most natures, the American representatives were therefore anxious to find some other resource. After careful study of the requirements and possibilities of output, Great Britain was able to make an offer which will ensure the complete equip-ment of the whole 80 divisions, provided&apos; the American authorities are prepared to accept British types of artillery.The following table shows the total requirements of the United States ; the number which the French can supply, including those already handed over to date; the new British offer and balance to be supplied from American resources:-Nature.	Total Requirements.	Proposed Supply from France.	Proposed Supply from Great Britain.	Balance to be Supplied from United States.Field guns	6,610	5,070	1,500	406-inch howitzer	3,000	2,190	- 710	1006-inch ,uun	1,500	450 (plus 200 modified range guns on howitzer car-riages plus 150	180 (plus 220-60-pi&apos;s.)	&apos;   300		105-mm. guns from Italy)						Heavy howitzer	763	Nil	450	313America may be able to do without bur assistance in the case of field guns ; but the prospective French supply is dependent upon forgings from America, and the forging situation in that country is already very difficult. Some discount will, therefore, probably have to be made from the French promises. Further, the Americans, in accordance with French precedent, have hardly any artillery of intermediate calibre between field guns and 6-inch guns and howitzers. This makes it the more essential that the field gun establishment should be adequate, especially in view of the prospect of continued open warfare next campaign. It was therefore represented to the American delegates that it would be unwise to turn off the prospective supply of British field guns or to run the risk of finding them next year unprovided with ammunition.In other natures there is no prospect of the equipment being completed without British assistance.&quot; In the case of the 6-inch gun, to which, in view of present methods of warfare, the French and Americans rightly attach great importance, the desired establishment can only be obtained if the American army will accept the French 105-mm. gun (which is now in actual production in Italy as well as in France) and the British 60-pr. In any case it is suggested that if the Americans are in a position to provide artillery personnel, it would be undesirable to turn down a potential supply of this relatively long range artillery.As regards the heavy howitzers : America will be in a better position to obtain a big output, as in both the 8-inch and the 9&apos;2-inch factories have for a long time been producing these equipments on British orders.If the British offer is accepted, ammunition can be supplied from shell to be made in American and Canadian factories which we propose to relinquish in 1919. This will for the most part be sent to Great Britain for filling. We shall require from the United States a small increase in shell steel shipments; and an increased supply of propellants, and of nitrate for the manufacture of explosives. But as this material would be in substitution for material that would otherwise be required by the American factories to produce the French-type ammunition, there would be no net increase in the demand for tonnage.We are awaiting the views of the American military authorities on this suggestion, which was made in consultation with the Master-General of the Ordnance on behalf of the Army Council.
