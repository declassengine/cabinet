215 &apos;LT. 51st August 1918PROGRAMS Or THE ROTO AIR FORCE TO 80 SEPTEMBER. 1919. % ALLOCATION OF AIRCRAFT TO THE! NAVY.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.With reference to War Cabinet papers G.T.6076, ft,T 5096, ft.T.5424 ami ft,T.5425, the Board of Admiralty desire to give the fullest support to the Air Council in developing the Royal Air Force&quot;and -*n its demand for the necessary&quot;man-power during the forthcoming year.but is unable to concur in the proposed allocation of aircfaft to the Navy in the amended Provisional Programme95 to 30 September, 1919,2.-   After discussion with the Air Ministry, a reduction of the ordinal Admiralty estimate (to a total of 130 squadrons)&quot;was agreed upon, but it reared that the further reduction now proDosed (to a total of 95 squadrons) will render it impossible to deal adequately with the submarine meriace (See Appendix),3.-   As a set-off against this second reduction the Air Council propose to hold an Unallotted Emergency Reserve for eventualities, and in rtreat emergency to detail suitable squadrons from this Reserve&quot;and the Independent Forces to support those portions of the Air Forced oo-oper?tingJwith the Navy,  Anti-Submarine work, however, requires training and experience, and a sudden reinforcement from the Reserve or Independent Forces, unless specially trained, could have little effect upon the situation for a considerable time.    Moreover, it appears possible that the control of a large portion of the Independent Forces may pass from the Air Council, thereby lessening the forces at its disposal!4,-    T,he Council advances the argument that successful aerial attack upon the enemy1s centres of submarine production must&quot;materially restrict his campaign, at sea and, further, that the attacking power of the anti-submarine aeroplane squadrons will be greatly increased.The Admiralty view is that the country cannot afford the risk of these predictions being incorrect.&apos; Moreover, in the programme under discussion, the Admiralty require to make provision for an enemy submarine policy of concentration in the approaches to the English Channel and the Irish Sea, which will involve flying-boats in large numbers or equivalent means of dealing with the enemy,5,-    It is freely-admitted that the Admiralty, demands have increased of late;   previous to this year the standard of airmanship and seamanship attained by tne Flying Service was such that the use of aircraft to the Navy was limited, and former estimates were based on the possibilities which then existed.   Recently the standard of&quot;performance of the aircraft and of the aircraft personnel has reached a point which opens up 3a?&amp;e fields of activity for naval&apos;purposes.
6.-   The satisfaction of the essential requirements of the Fleet and of the Armies in the f:eld is clearly the first charge uoon the Air Ministry, provision for the Independent &quot;orces being secondary thereto.  These, in fact, were the conditions on which the Air-Ministry was constituted, and the Admiralty desire to urge, in the strongest possible way, that these intentions should be upheld in practice, and that if th^re is a shortage of materials to meet all  reasonable requirements the deficit should fall upon the Independent Force.7.-   The submarine campaign still reins ins a vital factor of the war;  the responsibility for anti-submarine strategy must always rest with the Admiralty, and the Board could not accept reduction of its demand for aircraft on the grounds of disagreement or ortitcism by the Air Council in any detail of its submarine strategy.The only grounds on which the Admiralty consider a reduction should btv entertained are, either that the squadrons (materjel and personnel) cannot be produced, or that the squadrons are require&apos;! for some more&apos;important purpose outside the province of the Admiralty, In which latter event the decision and responsibility would lie with the War Cabinet0(signed)   ERIC GEDDES.b1,8,18,
