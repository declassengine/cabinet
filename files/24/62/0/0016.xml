^^Jm^ji(^^k the Property&apos; &quot;Confidential..of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Political Intelligence Departai ant, Foreign Office.C-t).[August 22, 1918.]United States /006.MEMORANDUMonSHIPPING,MUNITIONS, WAR SUPPLIES, AND SHIPBUILDING.THE following memorandum on the organisation in the United States of Munitions, War Supplies, Shipping, and Shipbuilding has been received from Lord Reading, as the third instalment of his series of reports on war organisation in the United States. The two previous reports on War Trade Organisation and on Labour have already been circulated.It is regretted that owing to delays in transmission this report is now some seven weeks old.Before dealing separately with the Departments which come under the above heading, it will be convenient to survey, very briefly, the general course of develop-ment of American activities in these spheres.- After the entry of America into the war (April 1917) a period followed during which programmes were being framed, types and designs considered, and organisa-tion devised. There was not unnaturally some confusion and delay in adapting the .peace-time machine of Government to war needs. Some months elapsed in each of the principal spheres of activity before definite schemes were adopted, and the organisation created at the beginning was generally found to require subsequent modifications.The projects framed were on a very large scale. Time would undoubtedly lr-been saved if types and designs which were already being produced for the Allies had been adopted for the American forces, particularly those which were already being produced in America. But the designs adopted were, generally speaking, those which were not being produced in America, and in almost all cases the desire to improve upon these types was too strong. The changes of design which were made may have been improvements, but they involved modifications in the producing plant, and postponed by months the date at which large deliveries could begin.The next period from the early autumn of 1917 to the early spring of 1918 -was one of preparatory work. Shipyards on a large scale (such as that at Hog Island, with its fifty slipways) were being constructed. The necessary plant for the production in quantity of the Liberty engine, of aeroplanes, of guns, of ammunition, was being created or adapted: and the output of raw materials, such as metals, timber, &amp;c, was being accelerated, and in some measure controlled.These operations were retarded by&apos; the exceptionally severe winter of 1917-18, and the breakdown of railway transport, which resulted partly from the weather conditions and partly from the defective management of the railways under their separate directorates. In the spring of 1918 the public awoke to the fact that the very large expectations of production which had been proclaimed in official utter-ances, and magnified by the megaphone of the press, were not being realised. There were severe criticisms in the Senate, in the House, and in the press, and a general feeling of uneasiness arose in the country. . This feeling was increased by the German offensive in France, and supplied a powerful stimulus to the energies of the Government. . One result was that President Wilson, utilising the powers given to him by the Overman Bill, made several important changes in organisation and personnel. The tendency of these changes was to concentrate in the hands of individuals powers which had hitherto been exercised by boards, and to make greaterGENERAL SURVEY.367-36]B
use of persons who had risen to prominence in industry or finance. The railways had already been taken over by the Government at the end of December 1917, and placed under Mr. McAdoo, as Director-General. The powers of the War Industries Board were in March concentrated in the hands of Mr. Baruch, its Chairman, who had been successful in finance of a somewhat speculative character. The powers of the Shipping Board as regards shipbuilding were entrusted to Mr. Schwab, well known as a great and powerful organiser of the steel industry; while the practical management of the ships under American control was handed over to the Shipping Control Committee, a small body of three, of which Mr. P. A. S. Franklin, Manager of the American Tine, is Chairman. Mr. Stettinius, who had shown great capacity in the management of several large industrial enterprises, and who had been in charge of the purchase of munitions &quot;for the British Government, when.it was con-ducted by Messrs. Morgans, was introduced into the War Department as Second Assistant Secretary for War. Mr. Ryan, a leading man in the copper industry, was placed in charge of aircraft production, the Air Board being made purely advisory.The effect of these changes has been beneficial, and we are now entering upon the third period, when the laborious preparatory work of the second period is begin-ning to have its effect in rapid production. It is of course easy to exaggerate the probable output, and further disappointments may be in store. But, on the other hand, the characteristic of the American system of production is that when the plant has been created, a good organisation framed, and the preliminary difficulties over-come, the stream of production flows in great volume, It may be hoped therefore that in shipbuilding, in the production of aeroplanes and aircraft engines, and in some classes of munitions, large results will be obtained in the near future.WAR INDUSTRIES BOARD.It will be convenient here to explain the position of the War Industries Board in relation to war supplies.The War Industries Board as reconstituted possesses powers which are set out in President Wilson&apos;s letter of the 4th March to Mr. Baruch, of which a copy is enclosed herewith. Although the powers conferred on the Board are very wide, the actual activities of the Board have been largely advisory the programme and supply of ordnance, munitions, and other supplies for the army being entirely in the hands of the War Department; the programme and supply of the navy in the hands of the Navy Department; the supply of aviation in accordance with the programmes of the War and Navy Departments in the hands of the Aircraft Production Board, a self-contained branch of the War Department; the programme and production of shipping in the hands of the Shipping Board.The War Industries Board acts as a co-ordinating body, through which questions of priority of delivery of raw materials or other commodities are determined, but the executive of the various bodies mentioned above work out their various pro-grammes without much reference one to the other, and the War Industries Board would not hold itself responsible for a breakdown in any of the above-mentioned Departments.The War Industries Board has had to do with the fixing of prices of various commodities, especially raw materials, when purchased by the American Govern-ment or the Allies; advises the Allies as to the prices, and sources from which they should secure supplies; advises the Departments of the United States Government mentioned above in regard to the creation of new sources of supply, and sanctions the erection of plants for this purpose. All these functions are set out in the President&apos;s letter to Mr. Baruch, and the Beard has, on the whole, been successful in carrying them out. It has recently taken control of the sulphur production of the United States, and in the course of the present month Chemicals and Explosives Divisions have been created. They are, moreover, rapidly increasing in importance, especially as regards raw materials. It is, for instance, the War Industries Board which is responsible for the supplies of nitrates and issues instructions to the United States representative on the Nitrate Executive.The War Industries Board is not, however, an executive head. It is not respon-sible for the creation of the united machine of war supply, which can only be brought into existence by co-ordinating the functions of all the departments named above. The actual creation and production of supply, from an executive point of view, remains at present almost entirely in the hands of each Department of the United States Government.
AVIATION.Production.As regards the past, it is probable that the want of exact knowledge here as to what was expected of the United States in the way of aircraft production has delayed the programme, and that frequent changes in the programme have upset the plans of the Department. To this it may be added that those responsible for the production of aircraft in America have not been ready to adapt themselves to the rapid changes in requirements which the situation at the front makes necessary, and have planned for very great quantities of certain engines and planes without providing facilities for improvements and changes of design which are rapidly occurring, regarding the whole matter as a definite manufacturing proposition, organising Departments on this understanding, and dealing with contractors on this basis. uOn the other hand, the firms which were given orders last summer and autumn are now organised and are beginning to produce a large output of Liberty engines and a few types of aeroplanes. Shop organisation generally is excellent, but there is a serious dearth of technical knowledge and experience, which has led to certain failures and mistakes in manufacture.Programme.Towards the end of May, General Pershing for the first time stated his definite requirements in squadrons for the American army, his demands amounting to about 260 squadrons by June 1919. These demands included definite recommendations regarding types of aircraft to be used for each purpose, and these types are almost exclusively Britsh. The aviation authorities in America feel that these demands are too large, and realise that it will be impossible to produce 260 squadrons by June 1919, and that it would be unwise to order sufficiently largely in the types asked for, as these will be obsolete before they can be produced in sufficient numbers.The importance of considering an aerial offensive on a large scale is now quite realised, and, as a step in this direction, the Director of the Air Division is proposing to equip a proportion of the bombing squadrons asked for by General Pershing with the latest V type Handley Page, which will be capable of far longer flights than those demanded for the American army.Generally speaking, the prospects are now satisfactory, although, as stated above, there is still a tendency for too great a measure of standardisation on machines which cannot maintain their position as regards performance much longer. It may be added that the problem of transporting finished planes to Europe in large numbers has not yet been fully faced.Organisation.The new organisation comprising an Air Division under General Kenley and a Bureau of Aircraft Production under Mr. Ryan, working under the Chief of the General Staff, as co-ordinating head, is working as satisfactorily as can be expected, but the higher aviation officials all appear to realise that a central head, whose responsibilities would be solely aviation, is practically a necessity, and that trouble will assuredly arise in the near future if such an appointment is not created. Many of these officials are undoubtedly sympathetic with the idea of an independent service with a Secretary for Air.The union of the American Air Services under a single head would go far to remove the difficulties of co-ordination which make themselves felt here, and it would assist towards solving the problem of complete co-operation and unity in. the aviation programmes of the Allies. At present the American representation on a central Aviation Programme Committee, whether consisting of several departmental repre-sentatives, or if a single representative, would be in receipt of possibly divergent instructions from several different departments which have no common head but the President.
AKTILLERY.I. Organisation.The divisions of the War Department concerned in matters affecting the artillery are those of the Chiefs of Field and Coast Artillery, the Ordnance Depart-ment, and the Purchase and Supply Division of the General Staff.The Artillery.Both branches of the artillery held and coast have now got chiefs in every way qualified for their posts, but the artillery organisation has the serious defect that these two branches are entirely separate, each under its Own chief. The coast artillery is responsible for the provision of the heavy artillery for the Expeditionary Force, and the latter is thus being prepared for service in France quite independently of the field artillery with which it will have to work there. Moreover, the Ordnance Department, which provides the whole of the equipment, is again independent of the artillery altogether, although all experience shows that in this arm the technical and tactical considerations are too intimately connected, to be separated without loss of efficiency.The Ordnance Department.As regards the Ordnance, while this is nominally a military department, it is not really so, for its officers do not belong to the &quot; fighting troops,&quot; and so have no actual Experience in the use of the weapons for the design and output of which they are responsible. Its military status, moreover, entails a position of dependence on the General Staff and the Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Force, which renders impossible any such &quot; intelligent anticipation &quot; of military needs as has been practised by the Ministry of Munitions.The Ordnance organisation is also defective in that, while the different divisions  design, requirements, procurement, production each deal with all articles up to a certain stage; there is no machinery for maintaining continuous control over each article through all stages, and no one therefore responsible for seeing that actual results are obtained.The Purchase and Supply Division.The same defect runs right through the War Department, and the new Purchase and Supply Division of the General Staff was accordingly organised by&apos; Mr. Stettinius to co-ordinate requirement and watch the progress of production. The officers of this division hope to do the work done by the Requirements and Statistics Branch of the Ministry of Munitions, and also all that part of requirements which is done by the War Office, but the division is not yet in full working order.Ministry of Munitions.The formation of a Ministry of Munitions on the model of ours is, however, still held by many Americans to be the right course, though it is hard to see how this can come about while Mr. Baker is Secretary of War. General March, the Chief of the Staff, is also determined that the whole organisation shall remain a military one.Gas Services find Mechanical Transport.Several minor reorganisations of great practical value have, however, been recently made in the War Department. The most important of these are the amalgamation of all the departments dealing with gas offensive, defensive, and research under a Director of Gas Services, and the very similar creation of a Directorate of Mechanical Transport to control the supply of all motor vehicles. Up to this such vehicles were designed and ordered by every department that used them, quite irrespective of the requirements of any other.
II. Output.Broadly speaking, the only natures of guns which are in production are the 75 mm. field gun, model 1917, the 4.7 heavy field gun, and the 8-in. howitzer. The 75 mm. is our 18 pdr. modified, and the 8-in. is, of course, an English pattern, while the 4.7 is a pre-war American service type. All these are, therefore, only the con-tinuance of patterns under manufacture before the United States entered the war, and not one complete equipment of any of the French types then adopted has yet been produced in spite of ail that is said in the press.*As regards these latter, the first 155 mm. howitzer equipment should be finished by the end of this month, and if the recuperator proves satisfactory, quantity pro-duction should start in October; the first 240 mm. may be expected about the end of September, and quantity production should start in December&quot;; the first 155 mm. (Filloux) equipments should be completed in November; and the 75 mm. in December; and both these natures should get into quantity production in January. But these anticipations must be accepted as little more than guess work until the works engaged on their manufacture have shown their capacity to actually make the various parts, especially the French recuperators.Gun A mmunition.The output of ammunition has been practically entirely suspended owing to a series of disappointments. Both with the high explosives and gas shell, failures have occurred with the fuses, boosters (games), and in the actual filling of the shells. Some of these may be regarded as incidental to first production, but others may be traced to the tendency to introduce modifications into any foreign designs, however successfully these may have stood the test of war, and they have been allowed to develop into a serious check to output owing to the bad organisation of the Ordnance Department.It is quite impossible to give any useful estimate of future output until it is quite certain that these difficulties have been overcome, and it is too early yet to say with any confidence that this is the case, although the American Ordnance officers are very hopeful on the subject. In another fortnight&apos;s time, however, it should be possible to give seme fairly reliable figures as to anticipated output.Trench Mortars.Except as regards 3-in. Stokes mortars, of which some 1,000 have been delivered, the manufacture of trench mortar material has not yet reached the production stage. Many details are still unsettled, and it is too early yet to make any useful forecast of future output.Machine Guns.The light Browning machine gun, and the Lewis and Marlin aircraft machine guns, are all in the production stage, and the output is such as to warrant regarding the supply as assured. The &quot; heavy Browning &quot; is, however, only just coming into production, and many complaints are being received as to defects in those issued to the troops. It is only fair, however, to say that something of the sort was anticipated in those first made, and these were kept at home in order that their behaviour in the hands of the troops might be watched. It is hoped that the defects found may be remedied without materially delaying output.Rifles and Small-Arm Ammunition.The position as regards rifles and small-arm ammunition need cause no anxiety. All difficulties appear to have been overcome, and the production is speeding up rapidly.* One of these articles recently appeared with the head lines:&quot; American-built 155 mm. guns roar in tests at Aberdeen.&quot; The facts of the case were that the first gun bodies turned out were being proved on a French carriage In these French types it is, of course, in the carriages and not the gun bodies that the difficulty lies.[367-36] C
SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.Shipping Board.The act authorising the formation of a Shipping Board as the organ.of Govern-ment lor dealing with all shipping matters, was passed in September 1916, but the Board was not actually constituted until January 1917.The Board has a twofold status: 11 On the one hand,&quot; quoting from the Board&apos;s First Annual Report, &quot; It is a part of the administrative machinery of the Govern-ment designed in times of peace to promote the development of an American Merchant Marine, and to regulate foreign and domestic shipping. On the other hand, and especially since the United States entry into the war, it has been given by recent legislation, comprehensive power of an emergency character intended to meet the shipping probelms incident to a consummation by the Government of its vast war purposes.&quot;The Shipping Act of 1916 contemplated and authorised the formation of cor-porations for the &quot; purchase, construction, equipment, lease, &amp;c, and operation of merchant vessels.&quot; Under these powers, the Emergency Fleet Corporation was created in April 1917, immediately after the entry of America into the war, as the executive organ of the Shipping Board for the exercise of the most important of the Board&apos;s war powers. The Corporation has a capital of $50,000,000, which is held entirely by the Government. It i has been found in this, as in other spheres, that commercial and industrial activities on.a large scale cannot be conducted efficiently or conveniently if they are subject to the restrictions applying to direct Government action, and the form of a Corporation has,, therefore, been adopted.The first Chairman of the Shipping Board-was Dr. Denman, and the first Director-General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation was General Goethale, It is unnecessary now to enter into the acute controversy which arose between Mr. Denman and General Goethale as to the programme and methods of ship construction. It was terminated in July 1917 by the resignation of both Mr. Denman and General Goethale, and the appointment of Mr. Edward H. Hurley as Chairman of the Shipping Board and President of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. The result of the controversy, and, in particular of the policy followed by Mr. I Denman, was to interpose delays of a very serious character in the initiation of shipbuilding on a large scale.Emergency Fleet Corporation,The functions of the Emergency.Fleet Corporation originally related both to operation, and.also to construction. A Division of Operations was created for the operation of the ships controlled by the Shipping Board, and the administration of the requisition programme. This Division still remains in existence, but a large part of its functions was transferred in February 1918 to the Shipping Control Committee, which was formed for this purpose. The constitution and functions of this Committee will be described later.The duties of the Emergency Fleet Corporation relating to construction were from the beginning the more important part of its work, and now constitute almost the whole of it. They comprise (1) the completion of ships in course of construction in July 1917, which were requisitioned by the United States Government; (2) the supply of ships to be built under contracts placed by the Corporation; (3) the supply of ships to be built in large agency plants created and operated under the direct control of the Corporation. . ,....   ;The work thus undertaken was of very great magnitude, and it was necessary in many cases to construct and equip shipbuilding yards before the actual construc-tion of ships could be begun. It was also necessary to make all arrangements for the production of ship plates and other parts at a number of different factories in all parts of the United States.The winter of 1917 was exceptionally severe, and seriously retarded the con-struction of the new shipyards. This delay gave rise to much criticism, which should have been directed at the initial delay in determining a programme and setting to work upon it, rather than against any absence of, effort when the work was once begun. In May 1918, Mr. Schwab was appointed by the President to-be General manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation with very full and independent powers. Mr. Schwab is a man of great force and character, of genial manners, and boundless
energy. He is well known as a successful organiser of the steel industry, and has, since the beginning of the war developed to its present proportions the enormous steel and munitions plant at Bethlehem. His personality, and the powers conferred upon him, have enabled him to stimulate the work of the shipyards, and may be expected to lead to a larger output than would otherwise have been obtained.One of his first measures wras to remove the offices and the whole administrative staff of the Emergency Fleet Corporation from Washington to Philadelphia, which may be regarded as the centre of the shipbuilding industry.Some care is required in interpreting the published figures of the output of ships. These are given sometimes in gross tons (the measurement adopted in British statistics), and sometimes in deadweight tons. Wooden ships are sometimes included as well as steel, and occasionally the total is not limited to sea-going ships, but includes those which are non-sea-going. There is also some difficulty in reconcil-ing the figures published by the Shipping&quot; Board with those obtained from Lloyd5s agents, probably owing to differences in fixing the point at wnich a ship is deemed to be completed.Taking the figures published by the Department of Commerce for the output of vessels built and officially numbered (i.e., nearly completed) in the United States, it appears that the output of steel ships for the first six months of 1918 was 717,000 gross tons (the corresponding figure for completions furnished by Lloyd&apos;s surveyors being 681,000), and that of wooden ships 107,000, making a total of 824,000. It is difficult to estimate the probable output for the second half of this year It,is certain that it will be larger than the output for the first half, and it will probably be limited, not so much by the capacity for turning out hulls, as by the supply of engines. It is not excessive to estimate that the output of steel and.wooden ships for the second half of the year will be double that of the first half, or, say, 1,600,000 tons, making a total for the year which would not fall far short of 2,500,000 tons. It should be added that the estimates of the Shipping Board contemplate a much higher figure than this, but, on the other hand, the Technical Department of the Ministry of Shipping consider that the steel ships completed in the second half of the year will not appreciably exceed 1,000,000 gross tons.The wooden ships will be of comparatively little use for ocean traffic; but they can be employed to some extent in local trades, such as the New England coal trade, or the West India trade, and in this way will set free a certain amount of tonnage which can be used, for other services.The output of new tonnage for the next six months will be fully absorbed in meeting such requirements as the army, the new England coal trade, &amp;c, the latter being seriously behind; but, from the early months of 1919 onwards it seems possible that a surplus of tonnage will develop, provided that the existing army programme is not increased.Shipping Control Committee.The Shipping Control Committee, working in conjunction with the Division of Operations of the Shipping Board, is the medium for the employment and operation of American controlled tonnage.Speaking in general terms, the American tonnage may be divided into two heads, viz.: -(a.) Tonnage in service of the War Department.(b.) Tonnage employed on behalf of the Shipping Board in essential import and export trades of the country.The Shipping Control Committee, through its several departments and internal traffic organisations, undertake the physical loading of the War Departments steamers, and it may be safely said that increased efficiency has resulted, and that there is no longer ground for the criticisms previously directed against the army movement.The work is in the hands of men thoroughly versed in questions of ships5 loading, stowage, and freight handling, and, despite the considerable volume of traffic and the difficulties which surround the movement of army supplies, due to constantly changing priority lists, the movement is proceeding smoothly.It is becoming increasingly evident that the manning question can only be properly solved by the navy, and they have been requested to provide and train a
number of men-approximately 22,000 officers and 200,000 men-for service in the new tonnage, to be delivered between the present time and the 31st of December, 1919.Practically all steamers running in the War Department service are operated by the navy with navy crews.With regard to the tonnage employed in the import and export trades on behalf of the Shipping Board, the principal &quot;followed is for the Division of Operations in Washington to assign steamers for management to private firms. It then becomes the duty of the Shipping Control&apos;Committee to determine the trade in which par-ticular steamers are to be employed.The chief services in which steamers under this heading are employed are: United States/Brazil.United States/Argentine.United States/West Coast South America.West Indies Sugar Trade.New England Coal Trade.United States Hawaii.Philippines and Far East.The firms to whom steamers are assigned for management undertake, the whole work of ship operation, providing crewrs, &amp;e, in return for a fixed fee for the services rendered.All questions of rates and requisitions are dealt with by the Division of Opera-tions in Washington.General.The above sketch of the present organisation, and of the results obtained and to be expected, shows that the position of America, as a shipowning country, is being rapidly transformed; but the necessities and difficulties of the immediate present tend to obscure the possibilities of the future. As a result the authorities in charge of American shipping intend to proceed very cautiously towards either committing themselves to any future obligations or expressing any sympathy with measures that might appear to lead to the operation of American tonnage passing . beyond their immediate control.They probably realise that they are not yet adequately equipped to handle the bjirden of so vast an increase in their mercantile marine, but are, nevertheless, chary at this stage of undertaking any obligations that might in any way restrict the-future developments that are in contemplation.July 19:, 1918.
