Pine sunny weather was experienced throughout the country during the first part of last week, and in some of the Southern counties the corn crops were being got in so quickly that the corn harvest was expected to be finished this week.   Heavy rain was fairly general on Sunday, but, if this should disturb the finishing of the harvest work, it will, on the other hand, be of great benefit to pastures and roots, which in some districts were badly in need of rain.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. Kent.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 100 acres of land forming part of a 230 acre farm near Marden, This land has been seriously neglected and the greater part of it was under hops before the making of Regulation 2 NN for the restriction of hop growing.   The hops have been grubbed 3ince that Regulation came into force, but this has been imperfectly done and the land has not been cultivated for any other crop,   - The Committee propose to carry out the cultivation themselves. Glamorgan9   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a portion of Ogmore Downs in the Parish of St. Bride Major, extending to 178 acres, and they propose to cultivate the land by the aid of prisoners of war.
Prosecution.   A farmer at Moulton Chapel (Holland) has been fined 50 and costs for failure to comply with an order to break up 19jiacres of grassland for the 1918 harvest.     This order was made as result of an appeal, the Executive Committee at the same time allowing the farmer to postpone until the autumn of 1918 the brealf up of another field of 14 acres which he had previously been dlrec to cultivate for the 1918 harvest.   In spite of this concession th farmer had taken no steps to carry out the order as to the 10j- acr Claims for Compensation.   Instructions have been issued to Agricultural Executive Committees for the receipt of claims for compensation with regard to matters which will now be settled by arbitration in default of agreement, and for the preparation of reports on such claims.It had been hoped that the Losses Commission would conse to act as arbitrators with regard to those claims which had alread been submitted to them and had not been disposed of when the Corn Production (Amendment) Act, 1918, was passed; but the Commission have not seen their way to accept this suggestion.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.&apos; Allotments.   At Southern (Warwick) 176 of the 450 householders are cultivating an area of 177x acres as&apos; allotments, an average of approximately 160 poles per householder.Inspection of Bees.   Inspections of the restocking   Apiaries of the Bee-keeping Associations have been carried out in Gloucester-shire, Nottinghamshire, Glamorganshire, Herefordshire and Leicestershire.Small Live&apos;Stock.   During the week a further 52 offers to start Doe centres have been received.   Reports show that the scheme is being taken up throughout the country.The rabbit-breeding scheme suggested by the Horticultur Sub-Committee for Worcestershire has been accepted, and the Horticultural Sub-Committee for Oxfordshire have formed a 100 Doe centre.   Three 100 Doe Centres have been inaugurated by the Wiltshire Horticultural Sub-Commit tee.
TECHNICAL DIVISION. InapectIon of Land.    (1)    In a general inspection of land and crops in Gloucester, Hereford and West Somerset, the following, among other, points were noted.   Very satisfactory progress has been made with harvesting most of the fields are nov cleared. Little was seen or heard of failures on newly broken grassland; on the other hand successes were much in evidence.   The amount of arable land in the districts visited was greater than anticipated.   The Important swede crop of the Cotswolds is poor, but mangolds are relatively good.   The heavy crops of straw and the poor root crops will create a strong demand for feeding-stuffs throughout the area.(2)   The following are given as instances of the increase of tillage on farms which have been taken over by Agricultural Executive CommitteesNorfolk,    (a)   Long Stratton Farm, Stratton St. Michael (350 acres) was taken over in February, 1917, when only about 12 acres were ploughed, and most of the land was in out-run leys or derelict.   The farm Is now managed by the Executive Officer with the assistance of a bailiff, and only 55 acres have been allowed to remain in permanent grass.   The cropping is:-   wheat 85 acres, barley 39 acres, oats 70 acres, roots 59 acres, other crops 41 acres.   The crops are looking well, and the financial results of the Committeefs occupation should be eminently satisfactory.(b) Horsey Marshes and West Somerton, Palling,   These aretwo blocks of marsh land near the sea which had been under poor grass for many years.   Representative areas amounting to about 250 acres in all were taken over in January last, ploughed, and sown mostly with oats.   The crop is patchy, but on the whole satisfactory.(c) Bacton Farm, Bacton, was practically derelict when taken over last year, only 50 acres out of a total area of 425 acres being ploughed.   At present over 400 acres are actually under crops, 111 acres being wheat, 83 acres barley and 57 acres oats.   The crops are
tgood, and the marked general improvement effected in so comparative short a time is an excellent illustration of the national importanj and value of efficient farm management. Kent, (d)   Crundale House Farm, Crundale (230 acres), was taken over in a deplorable condition in  larch, 1917.   At that time a local valuer, appointed by the Committee to make an inspection, reported that it was not worth cultivating.   The arable land, comprising 120 acres, is now fully cropped, 100 acres being under corn, and the general condition of the crops is very satisfactpry, Middlesex, (e)   Land at Laleham, near Stalnes.   This land forms part of an extensive tract acquired by the Metropolitan Water Board for the purposes of a reservoir.   Much of the area is simply, scrub-covered v-aste.   Some 330 acres have been broken up by the Committee;   about half of this has been let to four tenants, and now growing useful cr,ops of corn.     The remainder is being manage^ by the Committee,   and carries good crops.Rutland,    (f)   About 300 acres of Extoh Park, Rutland, the propertj of Lord Gainsborough, were taken over at the end of last year. Of this area, about 200 acres have been broken up and cropped; 150 acres are under barley, and 37 acres under wheat.   The late sowing and character of the season have affected the success of the corn crops, but on the whole the returns are likely to be considerably better than might have been expected.    The management is skilful and energetic, and the outlook for the whole scheme distinctly promising.Shropshire, (g)     The Executive Committee have ploughed up about 100 acres of the Bromfield Race Course, near Ludlow;   85 acres are now under oats, and the remainder under potatoes. . The oats suffered considerably from drought, and from the spongy seed-bed, but are a useful crop, and there will be a substantial yield over the whole area,     The potatoes are an unusually good
crop.    Regarding the work as a whole, the action of the Committee in ploughing up the land has been justified.LABOUR. DIVISION.Soldier Labour.     The number of soldiers now out on farms, in addition to the men specially released for harvest work, is 61,603 as compared with 59,553 four weeks ago.6,804 soldiers,temporarily released for harvest work are now out on farms.War Agricultural Volunteers.     The total number of volunteers placed to date is 2,863, an increase of 237 since last week. Prisoners of far.   Pour additional prisoner camps were opened during the past week, making the total number of prisoners now employed on agricultural or drainage work as follows..-Prom 312 agricultural camps...........   18,222Employed from other camps     ..........&apos;.     1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on farms ...        71119,941Aliens employed In agriculture 2,242Total&apos;................   22.183Four weeks ago the total number was 19,975.34 additional schemes are now under consideration by the War Office&apos;&apos; These provide for the employment of a further 1,676 prisoners.5.
Women&apos;a Branch. ^Bnployment.   Winter work for women of the Land Army is being organised with a view to creating a reserve of hardened labour fo the spring.     It is hoped that a certain number will be drafted t aSforestation as well as timber cutting, and others to the deseeding of flax.     Threshing will employ a large number, during, such time as they are not required for other agricultural work. Training.   It has been found that the short periods of training hitherto giver have-not..usually been sufficient to produce good milkers.     An experiment has, therefore/ beea. started on a farm in Surrey where ten women are to be trained for two or three- .aonr cr until they are considered efficient, receiving wages from the owner of the farm from the start.     Farmers in the neighbourhood have .already asked for the services of women from this centre as soon as they are trained.There is a great slackening in the number of recruits from all counties and a certain number of training centres are consequently being closed down.There are 15,815 women at present in the Land Army. A lower number than last week is explained by the fact that the si taoriths for which a certain number enrolled has now come to an end, ^he number above are accounted for as follows:-On farm work .,,.....................*. 12,34*^Lent to Forage Committee ............. 140Lem, to Timber Supplies Dept.......... 154In Instruction Centres............... 2,234Waiting for references to be placedin Training Centres ......... 270?;aiting in Depots.................... 394Waiting in their own homes......... 281Total ...... 15,815pour weeks ago the total number was      14,555CULTIVATION DIVISION Tractor Scheme.

Henry Ford &amp; Son had been dispatched to farmers.During the week ended 9th August, 6,013 acres were ploughed, 1,004 acres were cross-ploughed and 1,893 acres were cultivated. &apos;.&quot;Arrangements have been made for the supply of conversion sets for Oliver ploughs which enable the width of the furrow to be reduced, and also for the supply of safety hitches for Fordson tractors in order to prevent the possibility of tractors overturning when the plough sticks. Steam Tackle,   The acreage dealt with during the past week Is&quot; as follows:-   ploughed 3,457 acres, cultivated 39,488 acres, harrowed 324 acres, mole-drained 371 acres, rolled 88 acres. Total 43,728   acres.Arrangements for the 1918 Harvest.   During the week ended 24th August, 19 threshing machines were consigned, making a total of 293 consigned to date.     110 binders were consigned making a total of 4,192 consigned to date.double shifts of two hours, with three horses, have cut in large enclosures as much as 12 to 14 acres a day:    in smaller fields the average is from 8 to 10 acres.throughout the country on the working of self binders Is reported to have been of considerable assistance.Reports have been received that binders, working inThe instruction given by the Department&apos;s experts
Deliveries for agricultural purposes June - July 1917, 1918.Sulphate of Ammonia 22,762 tons. 26,780 tons. Superphosphate 26,569   &quot; 29,913   &quot;gBasic Slag 57,7.94   &quot; 92,884    &quot;Stocks at the works are relatively small and farmers and merchaij are ordering their supplies well in advance.    What stocks exis are probably only held owing to the shortage of railway trucks, makers have more orders in hand than they are able to fulfil..Orders have been drafted by the Ministry of Pood fixing a price for raw bones, and providing for the complete control of the trade in bones with the object primarily of securing the whole of the oils and fats produced from bones for use in the manufacture of glycerine or for edible purposes. These Orders, if brought into general operation, would re-act on the supply of bones for fertiliser purposes, but it has been arranged with the Ministry that, whilst taking powers to contrfl the trade, these powers will not be exercised by the Ministry o: Pood so far as they affect the fertiliser industry but will be transferred when desired to the Ministry of Munitions in conjunction with this Department. Potash *   Muriate of potash is now being produced at the Oldburj factory, but the price at which it is to be sold has not yet been finally settled.     It is proposed, however, to sell part (\Fertilisers.     The production and deliveries of sulphate ofIammonia., superphosphate and basic slag during June and July-the first two months of the fertiliser year, have been well maintained and compare favourably with figures for the similar period of last year.

Lime *     The experimental chalk grinding plant which has been erected by the Department at Coulsdon near Croydon, is now in working order and producing about 300 tons per week.     A similar experimental plant Is in course of installation at Stoneycombe, in Devonshire,Testing of Seeds Order.,     All the principal seed firms In the country have been visited by Inspectors of this Department in connection with the Testing of S eds Order, and it is found that, on the whole, the Order is being carried out in a satisfactory manner.     Inspectors are now commencing to visit the smaller nurserymen, and also firm3 selling seeds as a side line, many of which state that they have no knowledge of the Order, and others that they are unable to understand its requirements.     In order to assist the latter a special chart is being printed which gives at a glance the particulars required in the case of a sale of any of the scheduled seeds.Potato Spraying.     Potato blight has now been reported from Cumberland and Durham.    As regards the rest of the country, few very severe attacks have been reported, and in most parts comparatively little blight is present, especially where seed from a more northerly source has been used and where spraying has been carefully carried out.The general healthy condition of potato crops under field cultivation is striking and, failing a late development of disease on a serious scale, the yield should be excellent.Satisfactory reports have been received from various representative firms as to the quantity of knapsack sprayers
mdisposed of during the period from the 1st November, 1917, to the 1st August, 1918.-    One firm reports that the number of machines sold, compared with the same period for the previous twelve months, is considerably more than double,- and another firm reports that the number is very little less than double.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E* Prothero, M.P.,President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesv
