UNITED STATES OF AI^RIOA. ^/kV&apos; *\ _____________ (/Iqs \ *    Admiralty Ifffmorapdum for the War Cabinet,In continuation of ray Paper No,gy5307 and of my further Paper of the 24th instant on the same subjeotjrl think $udjLthat the situation as regards Shipbuilding and the American ^Authorities merits still&quot; further consideration.Since I wrote my Paper of the 24th August.., I have, on return from a holiday, seen the correspondence with Admiral Sims, and I attach a copy of Ms letter,,   The situation is that we have acceded to a request of the United States that we should undertake   with &quot;&quot;&quot;ritish labour in British yards the refits i of their destroyers for one year,,   This involves the allocation of Dry Docking facilities and labour for the continuous refit of 7 and occasionally 2 additional vessels and the continuous use of an additional one or more dry docks for United States destroyers requiring abnormal repair owing to damage caused by collision, mines,etc.   Each vessel undergoing refit requires the services of 150 men.It was obviovjsly in the Allied interest that Great Britain should undertake this work as a destroyer refitted in United Kingdom Yards can be on service again in 14 days as against a probable period of 6 or 8 weeks if sent to America,It was thought reasonable by the Board of Admiralty that compensation should bo given to us for this diversion of effort to the Americans in the Allied interests   It was estimated that during 1918 about 90 UCS^destroyers would come in for refit or repair, and it was found that the labour cost equivalent to the work involved in refitting these destroyers to the end of 1918 would be represented, by 5 Oilers built in Great Britain, VTq discussed this matter with Admiral Sims, &quot;and informally he agreed that our view was reasonable, and he said that lie would ro6ommend it to the Authorities at Washington,   The attached copy of his reply now shows&apos; the situation, and apparently the United States Government is adopting the attitude that, whatever work of a Naval character we may do for them, whether it is in building and maintaining British Naval craft and doing&apos;more than our share of escorting (which if West-bound escorting becomes necessary will be very much increased),or whether it is in refitting their destroyers, which are only partially doing their own escorting&apos; without in any my undertaking an adequate proportion of purely offensive measures against the submarine, they should go on adding Merchant ships to the American flag until they have completed enough tonnage at any rate to carry the whole of the American troops reinforcements and supplies,I realise that questions of the very greatest magnitude are involved, and may possibly cause differences of opinion between us and the United States, but surely the principle underlying the whole natter is one which can hardly be put second to any other question,   A large and increasing American Army is coming to Europe and will go to other theatres of war0 Great Britain bears a vastly preponderating, burden of Naval effort, is sacrificing its Mercantile marine output to sustain that effort and to actually safeguard the American troops on passage and their supplies, andin addition to that is to repair American ships damaged in these waters and maintain the American Naval craft operating in these waters, and America
9 qrofusos to slve compensation in kind for what wo are doing,,I quite appreciate that the question of price of those ships is gormano to the subject, but in my opinion the basis upon which compensation should be given under all heads involved, is that of man power employed in productions which is the basis wo adopted in discussing with Admiral Sims the compensation of 5 Oilers up to the end of 1918 a    When the American refitting programme x^eaches its maximum, the small number of Oilers involved in the present suggested adjustment would be greatly increased,(SgdJ   BRIO G-EDDES,. 26/8/18,
0 ACOPY OP IfflB ^r ADMIRAL AIMS PEF RIFiiD .TQ IN FORCING TOQRAMDUM.58, Grosvenor Gardens,London S.W.1. August 15th, 1913.Subject:   Repair Facilities for United States NavalVessels in Europe0,   Contpen&amp;ation in Merchant Tonnage to be Transferred to the British Flag.Ily dear Admiral:Referring to your letter of June 18, 1918, dealing with the subject of compensation for the loss of shipbuilding capacity in the United Kingdom,   entailed by the assighraent of extensive repair facilities to vessels of the United States Navy, j deeply regret to have to inform you that the United States Navy Department is unable, at the present time, to arrange for the assignment o3? transfer of vessels from&apos;the United States to the British Flag.   As you no doubt are aware, there has been an enormously accelerated movement of the United States Army to Europe, since the date of my original discussion of this matter with Admiral Halsey.   This movement has been so r&amp;pfcd that the United States authorities are faced with a grave deficit in the tonnage necessary for the supply of the number of United States troops which are being sent to France, and both the movement of the troops themselves and their supply is only possible by the assignment of British tonnage to supplement the inadequate amount of United States&quot;tonnage.     In view of this state of affairs it does not appear that any good purpose would be accomplished by the proposed transfer.   Hay I assume that the inability of the United States Navy Department to concur in this policy, due to the changed conditions brought about by the development of the general war situation, will not, for the present-at least, affect or modify the arrangements now in force for the refits of United States Destroyers?Yours very sincerely, (Sd.)
