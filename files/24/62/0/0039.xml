Oonlldentlal. (August 28th, 1918.)mePolitical Intelligence Department, Foreign.Of fiod. GERMANY/0015.la116M E M C R A I) DOonTHE   COMING   GERMAN   PEACE   OFFENSIVE.Signs are multiplying that an elaborate German peace offensive Is in contemplation, and that it will take shape either before the Reichstag reassembles in the first weeh of November,or shortly after the meeting of the Reichstag&apos; in the form of a movement in the House and a response from the Government.     The declarations of Hintze and Solf bore un-mistakable traces of what Is going on behind the scenes. Hintze is a case of a sailor-diplomatist in the orthodox odour of Pan-Germanism imitating; A/t he methods of ICtihlmann and the advocates of a ;;peace by understanding&quot;.     The more moderate Prussian Conservatives, and with them, possibly Ludendorff, may consider that it is safe^to have a Prussian militarist diplomatising than an advocate o.f &quot;peace by understanding1&apos;, like Kuhlmann, trying to heep the German people in heart by assuring them that victory is on the way.Another set of symptoms Is to be found in the reports, of which some of the German papers are full, of movements in neutral countries and deliberations of neutral governments with a view to mediation.     These reports are often wholly or in part fabrications.     Thus, the other day, a reply given by the Swedish Prime Minister,   M. Eclen, to a deputation of Good Templars (a very influential body in Sweden) was converted in the German telegrams by a process of omission and distortion into an indication that the Swedish Government, alone or in -concert with other neutrals, contemplated mediation.     li. Eden
had really said in express terms that Sweden could clo nothing in that direction unless invitee! by the rival belligerents,Similarly the German press was led to found hope; of; Dutch mediate on upon a stage of: the- Dutch political crisis which offered the prospect ox a Clerical Ministry with. Mgr, Nolens or H. van Rispen, Dutch Minister to the Vatican, at its head.     It was hinted that the Clericals, ouin; to their relations viith the Vatican, might be able to initiate mediation in conjunction with the Pope.Similar statements have been current in Germany regarding the Swiss Government,     And now special attention is called in Germany to the first of a series of articles on peace in the B3rne Bund, a paper which has frequently betrayed pro-German sympathies and is at the same time in olose touch with the Swiss. Federal Council.     If the article has any German inspiration or is published after consultation with competent German authorities, it foreshadows further &quot;concessions&quot;&quot; by Germany in the autumn on the subject of Belgium.    The article represents an attempt which no German organ of the Reichstag Majority has had. the courage to make, to clear away certain German misconceptions regarding the attitude of the allied peoples and the effect of certain actions of Germany upon then.    Those who want peace, it says, must first realise with whom they are fighting, and the Germans are slow to realise that they have encountered the moral&quot; indignation of the British, American and French peoples and not merely the hostility of their Governments.For this reason:-&quot;The Belgian thorn must first be removed from the soul of the nations....... So long as the holders ofBelgium, which was occupied merely lor military purposes, want I to malce it a subject of bargaining, to say the least, no understanding will be effected, because reconciliation is impossible,&quot;
It Is for German strategists to say whether the military advantage which they gained by marching through Belgium outweighs the drawbacks which have resulted.    Amon.fi these drawbacks has been the effect upon the British people, because, whatever motives the Germans may attribute to the British Government, they cannot explain the self-sacrificino, action of 5,000,000 British volunteers by ,!the shopkeeper spirit1&apos; or by &quot;hypocrisy&quot;.Similarly in the case of America, the seriousness of whose intervention is at last being, acknowledged in Germany, no mere materialist interests can account for her action.    Belgium helped to rouse America, and then came the intensifiecUsub-marine campaign and the intrigue with Mexico.     (The writer in the Bund does not mention the plots directed by the German Embassy in America itself;)     The submarine campaign end the Mexican intrigue may have seemed justifiable on grounds of a near-sighted Realpolitik, but the intervention of America and all that it signifies must be placed in the other sCale of the balance.The Allies,for their part, have, in the view of the writerof the article, failed to realise what it is that moves the soulof the German nation.     According to him it is the unlimitedblockade.     It is for England and the Allies to calculate whetherthe material effects of the blockade have outweighed the moraleffects and whether indeed the moral effects have not material-ised in a way that has wrought greater damage than benefit tothe Entente.     He asks:-&quot;Whence came at the front and behind the front the throbbing sense that what is at stake is the last and greatest of all things, national existence? Whence, I) if not from the blockade, which menaces the wholepeople, and from the desire   for conquest and sub-jection which have found loud expression on the enemyfs side?&quot;(The writer in the Bund does not seem to realise that without the blockade the war could not have been conducted at all
by England     He, further. ignores the fact that the zeal of the German people for the war, the furor Teutonicus, was as great before the intensification of the blockade as it has been since.,, if Indeed it was not greater.)All this leads up to the conclusion that, before-peace.....canbo made, each side must have learned to understan &apos;i the war-psychology of the other and to form a true estimate of the things that mast matter to the other.     He does not think that a peace like that which vjas imposed upon Prussia after Jena could ever succeed in repressing the national life and aspirations of Germanyi     Nor on the other hand could a peace on the model of the &quot;no-peaceu of Brest-Litovsk ever be accepted by the Allies. What is wanted is a peace-programme which does not merely -vary with the vicissitudes of the battlefield,but which is so&apos; firmly based on realities that the peoples can believe in it.
