ENCLOSURE TO 0,T. 5556.Copy of letter from Secretary .cf State for Air to &quot;theSeerc1ary,- War Gahinet&apos;Air,Mini atry,Strand, W,C. 3.28th August,1 1918.., Sir,   &apos; .  .I de-sire to draw the attention of tho Prime Minister to a document which I have received, Joint Note Ho.. 35, containing certain recommendations &quot;by the Military Representatives at Versailles on the subject of the bombing of Germany *   I also wish to record most strongly my protest, not only of the recom-mendations themselves, but also of the manner in which the subject has been dealt with by the Military Representatives.As tho War Cabinet are aware, this whole question has been the subject of discussion at.three consecutive meetings of the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee, and it will be clearly seen from the Minutes of these Meetings that the British Representatives present have emphatically and consistently recorded the opinion -that the operations of the Air forces carrying out the long range bombing of Germany, whether these forces be purely British as at present, or Allied, as is hoped may be the ease In the future, should be entirely independent of the control of the Generalissimo commanding the Allied Armies on the Western &quot;Front.Tho reasons for this opinion have been fully set forth by the Chief of the Air Staff both at the Meetings referred to and in a memorandum submitted to the War Cabinet.   In this opinion I have myself most strongly concurred...       Failing to reach an agreement on this question, it was decided at the last Meeting of the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee to request the Military Representatives to refer it to the&apos; Supreme War Council for decision, and it was fully under-stood that they would lay before the Supreme War Council the - Minutes of -the Meetings and the&apos; opinions recorded therein.It now appears, however, that, instead, this vital question has formed the subject of discussion between the Military Representatives themselves, who without consultation with any aviation authorities have agreed on a form.of recommendation In complete disaccord, with the policy previously put forward by the Chief of the Air Staff and concurred in by the War Cabinet, thereby prejudicing the consideration of the case on its merits by the Supreme War Council.&apos;  I do not understand that the British Military Represents tivo has any authority to advise the British Government on^ . matters of air policy, whatever may be the position of other representatives with regard to their Governments, and I consider that he should have refrained from subscribing to a joint recommendation dealing with such a subject,The Secretary, War Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.- 1.
I would most strongly urge that he should be instructed to withdraw his endorsement of the Joint Note and that the whole matter be dealt with by the Supreme War Council at its next Meeting.   I regard the matter as cf fundamental importance, not only on account of the questions of Air Policy involved, but as striking at the root of the constitution of the Royal Air Force as separate and distinct from the Naval or Military Forces of the Crown.All the relevant papers can be furnished for the Prime Minister&apos;s information if desired.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Sgd.)   TOR. ^    . ,&apos;    &apos; Secretary of State.
