(This:y ofSECRET[NOT TO BE COMMUNICATED TO ANYONE NOT IN H.M. SERVICE.( Mediteiojanean District )orAir OperationsJune, 1918.ROYAL AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS, (Mediterranean District), MALTA.
REPORT   ON  OPERATIONS.MEDITERRANEAN DISTRICT.GENERAL.There has been a marked decrease of submarine activity during June, and amongst other causes it is believed that this decrease may be attributed partly to the success of our bombing operations against the enemy submarine bases at Durazzo ancl Cattaro.This bombing offensive which was begun with such successful results towards the end of April has been continued during June on all favourable opportunities.All the work has hitherto been carried out by No. 66 Wing working from Otranto ; but on 1st July a first raid was undertaken by a detachment of the newly-constituted No. 67 Wing at Taranto. The formation of this new wing has been somewhat hampered by lack of personnel, which it is hoped will be shortly overcome.In the iEgean the usual routine work has been carried out, a decided increase in hostile aircraft activity being noticed at the same time. Information was received at the beginning of the month that two additional squadrons were being sent from home to strengthen the iEgean Group to enable a sustained bombing offensive against Constantinople to be carried out. These orders were, however, subsequently cancelled and the two squadrons diverted elsewhere. At the same time the desirability of bombing Constantinople whenever possible with the existing strength of the group was emphasised and arrangements are being made for this to be done as far as limited resources will allow.Submarine patrols have been continued as usual in all areas, definite attacks being reported from Egypt.The &quot;Large America&quot; F3 flying boats based on Malta are carrying out extended patrols. One of these machines has now been flown to Otranto for work on the Barrage, where it is hoped to deliver a further two during the coming month.KITE BALLOONS.All Mediterranean Stations are now in a position to work, although in some cases personnel is not yet complete and certain stores and material have yet to arrive.Otranto Barrage.Brindisi and Corfu have been carrying out patrols during the month. At the latter station a patrol of one balloon out at a time has been practically continuous, and a patrol of two balloons is now being brought in as a matter of routine. Brindisi has suffered unfortunately from difficulties in material and bad weather conditions but has carried out a large number of patrols ; in both places the work done has given the greatest satisfaction. Submarines have been sighted by both patrols on several occasions, and in general the balloons are fulfilling all expectations. Their work is confirming the value of these weapons which has already been proved by their work in home waters.Escorts.The work of fitting out sloops and destroyers to carry kite balloons has been continued at Malta as also at other yards in the Mediterranean. Four destroyers have now been despatched to Brindisi, and four sloops to Corfu for the Barrage, and sloops for convoy work are now being taken in hand. Two should be ready by the middle of July, and others are in process of completion. A balloon escort between Gibraltar and Bizerta has already been started, and J uly should see the system in operation through-out the Mediterranean.m.n.f. 729.  650.  7/18.
SECTION I.ANTI-SUBMARINE REPORT AND STATISTICAL TABLES.AEGEAN GROUP.  (2nd to 8th June.)Routine dawn patrols have been carried out by seaplanes from Talikna (Lemnos), Suda, Syra and Skyros, and by land machines from Imbros, Stavros and Greek and British squadrons at Romanos (Lemnos).Since the 7th June the Greek squadron at Ilomanos has taken a share in the performance oE dawn patrols from Lemnos. A Henri-Farman bomber from this squadron is escorted by a &quot; Baby &quot; seaplane from Talikna. This change obviates the carrying out of sea patrols by machines not fitted to carry bombs, as. has previously had to be done owing to lack of Short machines the larger proportion of which are usually out of action through engine trouble..The Kassandra airship has been out of commission owing to a defective envelope.ADRIATIC GROUP-PATROLS   (2nd to 15th June.) Attack on Submarine.On 3rd June, Short seaplane No. N. 1301 attacked a submarine at 1020 (G.M.T.) in lat. 40o 15&apos; N., long. 180 55&apos; 111. Only the periscope was seen and the submarine submerged while the seaplane was one and a half miles away. One 230-lb. bomb was dropped on the estimated position of the submarine, four minutes after submersion, but failed to explode. No surface trace of the submarine could be seen. Two calcium flares were then dropped on the position, which was reported by W/T, and three destroyers in the vicinity were informed by Very&apos;s light signals and Aldis&apos; lamp message. The suspected area was searched continuously until 1315, when an oil patch was observed about two miles north of the original sighting. One 230-lb. bomb was dropped, which, this time, exploded satisfactorily.The machine returned to base at 1330.Submarine Reports.On 3rd June,iat 1510, a report was received giving the position of a submerged submarine as lat. 390 33&apos; N., long. 18Q 43&apos; E. The seaplane station at Santa Maria di Leuca was informed accordingly, and a Baby seaplane was despatched to the spot.When eight miles East of Fano at 1720, a large oil patch was seen, where a submarine had apparently submerged. Four 16-lb. bombs were dropped to attract the attention of a destroyer which turned towards the spot. The seaplane remained in the vicinity till 1720, when it returned to the base..On 5th June, at 0437, a submarine was heard on hydrophones in lat. 390 37&apos; N., long. 180 33&apos; E. The Senior Officer of the Barrage requested a seaplane to assist in the search. Short N. 1305 was sent away and patrolled the area for two and a half hours, when the machine developed radiator trouble, and was forced to land at Santa Maria di Leuca. The fault was attended to and the seaplane left for Taranto. When off Palascia, the same trouble again occurred and the machine was obliged to land on the sea two miles from the coast, being taken in tow by a motor launch sent immediately to her assistance.Neither observer or pilot had anything of interest to report.On 15th June, whilst Short seaplane No. N. 1501 was on Barrage patrol, a signal was received from the Senior Officer of the Barrage patrol requesting aircraft co-operation to search for mines off Santa Maria di Leuca. The seaplane was called up by W/T and proceeded at once to the area in question. At 1238 the observer reported mines directly beneath in approximate lat. 390 46&apos; N., long. 180 21&apos; E. The objects seen appeared to be in four groups forming a rough square about 500 yards across.On the same day Baby seaplane N. 2093, sent out from Santa Maria di Leuca station, reported a suspicious red conical object on the surface in lat. 390 50&apos; N., long. 18D 26&apos; E.Escorts. .On 12th June, a request was received from Brindisi for a seaplane escort to an oil steamer and a torpedo boat destroyer proceeding south through the Straits.  At 1020 in spite of a heavy sea, Short 1501 was sent away.   After endeavouring to pick up the convoy for an hour without * success, and thinking the vessels had probably put in again to Brindisi owing to the adverse weather seaplane returned to base.On 13th June, at 0430, two Short seaplanes were sent as escort to two formations of D.H. 4 bombing planes, but with orders that if British cruisers were sighted they were to escort them instead. At 0610 the cruisers in question wore sighted and the seaplanes proceeded to form an escort. Lamp signalling was successfully carried out with the ships, and both seaplanes continued to patrol round the fleet until shortage of fuel obliged them to land at Valona, at about 0950, after flights of 5 hours 20 minutes. Communication was also maintained between the two seaplanes the whole time.   Both returned to Otranto by 1500.MALTA GROUP.   (26th May to 30th June.)Routine anti-submarine patrols have been carried out during the month, but operations were curtailed toward the middle of the month owing to a continued spell of windy weather, when machines were compelled to return on account of bad visibility and rough weather,Convoy escort work has been carried out during the period under review, as far as weather has permitted. &quot; - .EGYPT GROUP.   (8th April to 8th June.)Routine anti-submarine patrols and escort work have been carried out as usual.

SECTION II. AEGEAN RECONNAISSANCE.Dardanelles Blockade.Reconnaissance of the Straits has been carried out at regular intervals during this -period. There has been nothing unusual to report.Escorted reconnaissance of Angista Valley, Razolivos and Drama aerodrome was carried out from Stavros on 2nd June. At Drama only four small white hangars and one large ono were observed ; this is less than half the establishment of this unit prior to our bombing offensive in this region, which commenced last month.      &apos;     ;Blockade of Turkish Coast.. ,On 5th June, a successful photographic reconnaissance of Kuleli Burgas was carried out from Romanos aerodrome by three D.H.4&apos;s.On 7th June, in response to a report of an enemy steamer steering north-west, a D.H. 4 was sent on patrol, in the vicinity of Chios, from Lemnos. Seaplanes were also sent up from Skyros and Syra, but nothing was observed, and this area was reported clear,Support of Right Flank.Escorted reconnaissance of the Lower Struma line has been carried out during this period and successful photographs taken. , . .Escorted reconnaissance of the Kavalla-Xanthi area has also been carried out. There are now only one large shed and one small seaplane shed at Gereviz, which is a reduction of one large and one small shed, as previously reported.ADRIATIC.On the 9th June, the four machines which carried out a bombing raid on the Gulf of Cattaro made a photographic reconnaissance of the shipping in the various bays. No change in the war -units was observed. The three Erzherzog Karl class ships were still at Oattaro. Seven &quot;K&quot; type bombing machines were seen on the slipways, probably having just returned from the series of raids on Brindisi early the same morning.. On 10th June, at 0820, a signal was received from Brindisi stating that seven enemy vessels had been reported,in lat. 420 00&apos; N.;&apos; long. 180 00&apos; E., at 6 &quot;30 a.rm Aircraft co-operation was , asked for to make a long reconnaissance and report position of enemy vessels; Weather conditions were very bad, rain, mist and clouds rendering visibility too low for aeroplanes to be sent away. Two seaplanes N. 1395 and N. 1833 left at 9115 and 9 &apos;40 respectively and proceeded to lat. 410 00&apos; N., long. 18 30&apos; E.,;being ordered to remain out until the last possible moment. The weather was then so bad that it was almost impossible to see more than a 100 yards in any direction. Reconnaissance was carried out in conjunction with the fleet for nearly two, hours, during which time continuous signalling was carried out by Aldis lamp between seaplane N. 1395 and the vessels in a most efficient manner. After patrol of five hours duration, Short N. 1395, was forced to return to Brindisi for petrol, landing there at 1415, and proceeding thence to Otranto later the same day. The second machine N. 1833, made a landing at Monopolr owing to shortage of oil-and petrol at 1345, and flew on to Brindisi four hours later.  Neither seaplane saw any hostile craft during the flight.D.H. 4 machines were held in readiness throughout the day in case the weather conditions showed any signs of improving. -,Two British machines from Otranto reconnoitred Cattaro 23rd June. One enemy machine was shot down. .SECTION III. jEGEAN group.On 3rd June, a. bomber escorted by two scouts from Stavros air station aimed eight. 16-lb. bombs at a transport in Razolivos Semultos road, probably causing casualties. Anti-aircraft fire was very heavy near Razolivos and the bombing machine was hit in the tail plane. Two hostile machines followed to the front line, but kept their distance.On 5th June, three D.H. 4 machines left Romanos to bomb Kuleli Burgas bridge and station on the Oriential Railway. Two machines reached their objectives and dropped nearly a quarter of a ton of bombs, damaging the station and buildings; The third machine had to turn back on reaching Demotika owing to a burst oil tank. The 230-lb. bomb carried was dropped on sheds S.W. of Demotika with unknown results. The machine was kept in the air without oil for 80 minutes. Forty miles of enemy territory were covered and then an attempt was made to reach a landing ground. The engine seized and the machine was forced to come down in the sea one mile north of Imbros where the pilot and observer were rescued by M.L. 18(5.Stavros Air Station.A hostile machine which came over the aerodrome on 3rd June, was chased away and engaged over the front line where it escaped by diving into its own lines. Another machine which passed over the aerodrome on the 8th June, was chased, but our machines were unable to sight it owing to heavy detached clouds.On the 7th June, the machine from Stavros which performed front line reconnaissance, also dropped bombs in a trench, but the results were unobserved.On the 8th June, an escorted bombing attack was made on huts behind the Lower Struma lines, and bombs fell close to the target which was practically obscured by ground mist.
ADRIATIC GROUP.On 23rd May, at 1410, one hostile boat was observed Hying at an approximate height of 6,000 feet, apparently engaged on a photographic reconnaissance of Otranto. Five OameTs loft immediately in chase, but failed to locate or engage the enemy machine, which made good its escape.Short seaplane N. 1833 (Lieut. Clarke and A. M. Bramham), was sent away at 1500 in the direction of Durazzo to act as escort to the Camels. When about 15 miles south of Durazzo, at a height of 4,000 feet, the observer saw what appeared to be a large submarine lying at anchor. Accordingly the seaplane climbed so as to enter Durazzo from the sun.The vessel in question appeared to be a large ship without funnels lying about one mile south of jetties. One 230-lb. bomb obtained a direct hit on the bows from a height of 1,500 feet, and the vessel heeled right over to starboard. Further in the harbour were noted two light cruisers, and three destroyers, probably waiting for nightfall to make an attack on the Barrage lines. Several small balloons were observed to be sent up carrying a sort of ball giving off thick smoke-clouds.Anti-aircraft fire was very heavy and burst on all sides of the machine but without hitting it. Owing to failing light, the seaplane was forced to land on the water at 1810, when 40 miles north of Otranto, but was able to taxi Home in safety.On 25th May, a report was received from Brindisi that an air raid was in progress. Three Camels patrolled for an hour and a quarter from Otranto to San Cataldo at a height of 10,000 feet without sighting anything hostile.On 6th June, a report was received from Saseno that enemy aircraft were making for Otranto, A Camel was sent up in chase and after remaining in the vicinity for an hour, returned with nothing to report.The following is a fuller account of the raid on Cattaro on 28th May, briefly reported in last month&apos;s summary : Seven D.H. 4 machines from Otranto left at 0700 to carry out a bombing reconnaissance of Cattaro. One and a half tons of bombs were dropped. A photograph was taken showing one 112-lb. bomb bursting directly alongside a submarine in the act of submerging. The effect of previous raids is shown in the disposition of shipping. The destroyers and submarines are now kept scattered, and all ships, even merchantmen, appear to be kept with steam up ready for moving instantly.All submarines submerged during the attack and a large number of ships got under weigh.Three &quot; Erzherzog Karl&quot; battleships were seen proceeding out of harbour at the time the machines arrived. They were apparently passing about two cables off Rondoni Rock on the east side of it. No obstruction could be seen on this side in the photograph. A submarine was also seen proceeding to harbour close in shore round Point Remo, which affords confirmation as to the mine-field marked off this point.One of the two escorting seaplanes sent out an &quot;S.O.S.&quot; at0650inlat 41025&apos;N,, long. 18o40&apos; E. The engine bearers broke, and after landing in the water the seaplane capsized, leaving the pilot and observer on the floats. The Commanding Officer of the destroyers on the Barrage detached a destroyer to her assistance, and the pilot and observer were picked up and brought back to Brindisi after the machine had been sunk.As D.H. 4 machines were to leave for Cattaro at 0500, two Camels were sent up to patrol as far as Sari Cataldo to keep a look-out for possible hostile aircraft proceeding south to Otranto. No machines were, however, observed.On 10th June at 0700, two &quot; K &quot; boats were observed at a high altitude, about four miles east of Otranto. Directly they appeared through the rather thick cloud banks and came within view of the base, both turned north at once and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire. Within three minutes of . the alarm, three Camels were off the ground and steered N.E. to intercept the enemy, at the same time climbing to 10,000 feet. Each machine ran into heavy rain, hail and snow storms and was unable to sight the hostile aircraft. It is most probable that the two machines referred to were making a reconnaissance of the Barrage in connection with the operations of the Austrian fleet during the same time further north.On 12th June at 0715, hostile aircraft were again reported north-east of Otranto, but as they made no attempt to approach the land and were soon lost sight of in the clouds, no offensive action was taken.On 9th June, a successful raid was carried out on Cattaro by six machines from Otranto, viz.:-by five D.H. 4&apos;s (No. 1772, Lieut. Strafford and Corporal Thrift; No. 9500, Lieut. Bolton and A. M. .Newton ; No. 2122, Lieut. Keymer and L. A. Comes; No. 1773, Lieut. Salton and A. M. James; No. 2149, Lieut. Anderson and Lieut. Sivil) and one D.H. 9, No. 2161, (Capt. How and Lieut. Ashworth). Two Short seaplanes, S. 1494, (Lieut. Pryor and Lieut. St. John) and S. 1310, (Lieut. Davenport and Corporal Macario) acted as escort.D.H. 4, No. 1773, was unfortunately crashed soon after taking off, and both pilot and observer were killed.  D.H. 4, No. 2149, developed radiator trouble and was forced to return.The remaining four machines arrived over the objectives carrying a weight of 1,800 lbs. of bombs and made very good shooting on the submarine and seaplane bases at Kumbur. It seems probable that one &quot;K&quot; (Brandenburg) seaplane was hit whilst lying at the end of one of the slipways and a large merchantman, moored to a jetty N.W. of the hangers was set on fire.Only one chaser-boat was observed to get off in pursuit. \ Anti-aircraft fire was not very accurate, but D.H.4, No. 9500, was hit once by shrapnel in one wing.All machines returned safely by 0920.
29,. ftOn 13th June, a second raid from 0 trail to to Cattaro was also successfully carried out by two formations, each formation consisting of three machines, viz.: D.H.4, No. 6422 (Capt. Leslie and Capt. Ohase); D.H.4, No. 6418, Lieut. Jeakes and Corporal Wallace); D.H.-4, No. 6421, (Lieut. Stonoman and Lieut. Hodgskin) forming the first formation, and D.H.4, No. 9500, (Lieut. Bragg and Lieut. Linder) ; D.H.4, No. .1772, (Lieut. Anderson and Lieut. Sivil); D.H.9, No. 2161, (Lieut. Sutherland and A. M. Easman) forming the second formation.The first formation left at 0310, and the second at 0505. 2,700 lbs. of bombs and 81 incendiary Thermit bombs were dropped. Owing to cloud banks partially obscuring the targets, no actual bomb explosions could be seen, but good sights were taken on the objectives the submarine and seaplane bases at Kumbur.Three Austrian &quot; Erzherzog Karl&quot; class were still at anchor off Genovic.The remaining shipping was disposed as before.Apparently seven or eight submarines were at ihe base.During the first raid three chaser-boats left the water, but made no attempt to attack. The second formation, however, were followed by four enemy boats, and three single-seater scouts of the Pokker type. The hostile seaplanes appeared to have made quite as good a performance as the D.H. 4&apos;s.. When forty miles S.W. of the Gulf, and at a height of 12,000 feet, the enemy overtook D.H. 4 No. 9500 and D.H. 9 No. 2161, and a sharp engagement ensued, during which D.H. 4 No. 9500 (Lieut. Bragg and Lieut. Lindner) was hit repeatedly and set on fire on the floor of the pilotfs cockpit by an explosive bullet which had passed up beneath the engine. Luckily the fire was stamped out, and after the leading hostile machine had been hit by tracers and had dived steeply out of the fight, the remainder also turned away.All our machines landed by 1000.On 26th June, three D.H.4 machines from Otranto raided Durazzo. Direct hits were reported on the seaplane jetty and the adjoining seaplane base was set on fire.  (Telegraphic Report only.)
