J521 MMP EFFORT OF GICaT BRITAIN ANDTHE TOT^-D STAT.,;S OF AFRICA,Note by Mr. i3alfourv(Sec also G.T. 5307, &quot;5541, 5494, and 5508)In accordance with Conclusion 6 of war Cabinet 456 of August 9, 1918, a meeting was held in the Foreign Office, at which I presided.   Lord Reading, Sir Joseph :aaclay, and the Third Sea Lord were present.As the result of the discussion it was decided that it was not advisablt to make any request to the United States Government for the material replacement of British Merchant tonnage lost.Sir Joseph Haclay was of opinion that the price asked would be too high to mako the acquisition of such ships a p^od bargain, and it was further felt that it was most unlikely r,hat the United States Government would in any case accede to the request.On the other hand,it was considered that the United States Government might reasonably bo asked so to adjust their ship-building programme that the ratio of merchant sho con-struction to war-ship construction should be the same      both countries: repairs being counted as construction.    At -present Great Britain is devoting a much larger proportion of her ship-yard labour to war ships than is the U.S.A.: to the manifest disadvantage of Great Britain.It was decided, however, that it would be very desirable that this plan should, in the firBt instance, be examined by the First Lord and Mr. Roosevelt, and that it would be premature to take any action until such a discussion had taken place.(Intd)   A.J.B,FOREIGN OFFICE,16, August, 1918.WS &quot;imiilllhwifhiillhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiihhwiiyilniiiliilili .111111 . .............
