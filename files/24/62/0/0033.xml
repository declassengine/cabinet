September 1918.ISECRET.G.T.-5533.I . &apos; JUS/&apos;WAR CABINET.THE COAL SITUATION.Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour.THE effects of the prospective coai shortage have certain implications in connection with the labour situation which require the most serious consideration. They may be briefly discussed under three heads, viz. (a)v the result on the labour situation in the mines themselves ; (6) the result on the general population due to deficiencies of fuel for domestic consumption, and (c) the result on labour in those industries which will be compelled to diminish their production due to lack of coal.(a.) Effect on the Miners.It is difficult to consider adequately the possible result on the labour situation in the mines without a review of the history of the mining disputes during the war, and of the various influences which have helped to shape the present temper and political outlook of the miners. These are dealt with at some length in an appendix to this memorandum, to which reference will be made from time to time. Briefly it may be said that the experience of the miners has convinced them of the overwhelming strength of their economic position. On practically every occasion on which they have come into conflict with the Government the struggle has resulted in victory for the men.It is little wonder, therefore, that the men have come to regard their position as impregnable, and to consider that they are in a situation in which they can enforce their demands on the State. It is true that there is no reason to assume that the miners are less patriotic than any other class of workers in the country. Their large contribution to voluntary recruiting, and the small amount of friction which took place during the successive severe combs-out, which have produced the present grave danger of shortage, go to show that their attitude is decidedly pro-war. But the past bitterness between them and the mine-owners, particularly in South Wales, and their experience of the weakness of the Government in the past, make the temptation to attempt to secure further concessions very great, especially when they consider that the State may be afraid to put up any serious opposition. The programme adopted by the Miners&apos; Federation at Southport * admittedly based on the idea of driving the owners out of an industry which their demands would make unprofitable, is an indication of the aims which they think they can achieve. That conference, it is true, decided to postpone till after the war, the application of the most drastic measure, which, however, was to be obtained within four weeks of the declaration of peace. But the unofficial reform committeet in South Wales, which in the Tredegar strike won a victory both over the executive and the Government, has declared for the immediate prosecution of a still more extreme programme. In this connection the activities of the C.L.C. and the various extreme Socialist and Syndicalist propaganda which flourish in South Wales cannot he left out of account. The effect of the coal shortage, which must result in the rapid decrease, and in many cases complete disappearance, of industrial stocks of fuel,* See Appendix, p. 10, f See Appendix, pp. 8-10.[749] B
will strengthen the economic position of the miners to an immense degree. In the event of a quarrel between the miners and the Government the situation would be of the greatest gravity. Industries would be brought to a standstill for lack of fuel, thousands of workpeople thrown out of employment, and domestic suffering would be very great. The miners, as compared with other trades, are peculiarly unsusceptible to public opinion, and in any case it, might possibly happen that the pressure of that opinion would turn in the direction of granting the miners&apos; demands, at whatever cost to the mine-owners and to the prestige of the State, in order to secure the preservation of industry as a whole. The severe rationing of industries with coal cannot, therefore, be without its effect on the attitude of the miners, and there can be no doubt that the above considerations will be urged on them by the more extreme elements. The conviction of such an unparalleled position of economic strength, coupled, say with the successful progress of the Allied arms, which would reduce the force of the patriotic argument against a struggle during the war, might help to precipitate a conflict of the most dangerous character.The above considerations generally hold, whether or not the miners do their best to secure increased output. As a matter of fact there are indications that they are not prepared to adopt all possible efforts in that direction. Although steps are being taken by the Federation to establish Joint Committees at all collieries to lessen absenteeism, in Fife and Kinross a resolution has been passed threatening picketing at pits where men have agreed to work six days a week instead of the usual five. On &quot;the 13th August the Northumberland Mine Workers&apos; Federation rejected by large majorities the proposals of the Coal Controller to provide increased labour by theagreed to allow their members to volunteer to fill coal into waggons on overtime shifts at overtime rates of pay. It may also further be noted that just as engineering employers have an interest in opposing dilution in order to retain skilled labour for after the war, so too colliery owners may in some cases favour decreased production in order to keep their unmined coal for the post-war period, when they hope that profits may be higher. .(b.) Effect on Domestic Consumption.The second aspect of the coal shortage arising out of its effect on domestic consumption is also serious. In winter the irritating effect of ill-heated homes on workers who are exhorted to work abnormally hard must be expected to be great. It is bound to affect also the temper of women and children, and it cannot, under present circumstances, be met by an increased consumption of food. The lesson of the discontent caused by the food situation should not be forgotten. Numerous one-day protest strikes took place in the mining industry (see appendix, p. 7), and in other trades, and no other cause was so universal as underlying almost all the industrial unrest of 1916 and the early part of 1917. The Commissions on Industrial Unrest appointed after the great May strike in 1917 are unanimous in putting forward discontent at the rise in prices of food and inequalities in its distribution as among the main causes of the general irritation of labour. It is certain that deficiencies of fuel for domestic consumption during the coming winter may be expected to have a similar effect, and it may be remembered that in November 1917 a serious strike occurred at Cowes, involving some 7,000 men, who came out as a protest against the excessive price of coal. It should be realised, therefore, that the effects of a decreased supply of coal will not only result in domestic inconvenience and sacrifice of comfort, but will be bound to have psychological reactions on the general temper of labour, which will accentuate unrest, and also of the army, similar to those disclosed by letters from the front during the food shortage last year with its resulting queues.It is to be noted that the above considerations apply, even assuming that there are no difficulties encountered in putting into operation a scheme of coal rationing. Without making any reflection on the Coal Control Department, it may, however, be suggested that this is in the last degree unlikely. As regards the effect on the private consumer, the greatest care, the most elaborate machinery, and a longer period of preparation were required for the rationing of food, and while this may have been a larger, it was certainly a simpler problem than that of coal rationing. Whereas all individuals, with comparatively unimportant exceptions, can be treated as alike in the matter of food, this is not to the same extent the case in the matter of coal, owing to the different conditions under which different persons live, and peculiarities attaching to the use of coal substitutes. An inherent objection, psychologically, to any rationing scheme, as has been found in the case of food, is that, even where there is noemploymentGerman prisoners, though they
foundation for suspicion, anger at supposed unfair treatment, favouring the richer members of the community at the expense of the rest, is apt to break out; and if the grounds are to some extent real, as would probably be unavoidable from the very nature of the problem, the case is so much the more dangerous. A more excellent weapon for agitators of all kinds can hardly be imagined.Widespread apprehension regarding the effects of the coal rationing scheme is at present finding expression in the press, and when the inevitable discomfort and discontent become manifest in the winter the papers will not be slow to recall their warnings and prophecies of August. The result will undoubtedly be to increase popular exasperation, to damage the prestige of the Government, and to diminish confidence in its efficiency.(c.) Effect on Industry and Employment.The effect of the shortage on industry, and the unemployment, which it is admitted will result, present again an extremely serious problem. The pottery, lace, textile, glass, and other industries, already express the gravest apprehensions on this ground, and it is admitted that considerable unemployment must result if the contemplated scheme of rationing is put into operation. The industries on which the rationing will fall most severely, viz., those which are most remotely connected with urgent Government work, are necessarily now largely staffed with women and juveniles, e.g., the pottery trade.The women have come forward to take men&apos;s places not only to meet the war demand for women labour, but also in industries not so directly concerned with the war in order to keep the industry alive till the men return. The effect of their wholesale dismissal, unless some further provision is made, cannot be expected to react favourably on their men relatives. The experience which has already been gained in connection with the dismissal of women workers from munition factories during the last two months demonstrates the seriousness of any unemployment problem at the present time. The shortage of labour has been so constantly emphasised that persons who become unemployed feel that they have been unfairly treated and that either the arrangements made by the Government have been culpably inadequate or their allegations misleading. Moreover the presence of considerable unemployment, while at the same time large earnings are being made in the purely war industries, is bound to have a most disturbing effect.Steps, it is true, have been taken to secure that inequalities of incidence of the rationing scheme, as between firms in proximity to pits which can consume slack and waste coal and firms at a distance from a colliery, may be obviated by allowing the distribution of the ration to be made by a committee of the trade, but this is not enough. It seems clear that if the direct action of the Government, as distinct from any ordinary risk of trade, is going to cause widespread unemployment, the Government cannot wash its hands of the responsibility, and the rationing scheme must be accompanied by a scheme for dealing with unemployment.It is necessary to have a rationing authority in every industry, and it is also necessary that half the members of this authority should consist of workpeople&apos;s representatives. No general percentage reduction of individual firms&apos; consumption based on last year&apos;s figures can produce equality throughout an industry. In all industries, some firms are working longer hours than others, and their workpeople will therefore be less affected by the reduction. Any system of rationing must be based on securing equality of production, and therefore equality of employment as far as possible, otherwise grave discontent is bound to ensue on the part of the workers who are less fortunate, because the firms which employ them either have not got Government orders or else consumed less coal than their neighbours last year and are consequently entitled to less coal this year. Lastly, if complete equality as regards the distribution of Government contracts and the incidence of unemployment cannot be attained, some system for providing for those who are thrown out of employment must be devised. A levy similar to that in operation in the cotton trade seems the fairest method of procedure. If, for any reason, firms are able to work longer hours than other factories in the trade, it is only fair both to the employers and to the operatives who are less fortunate that the firms working longer hours should pay a higher contribution towards the unemployment fund. The trade unions in the lace industry refused to take any part in the Coal Board which has been set up unless it was empowered to deal with unemployment, and, on the grounds indicated above, this attitude is reasonable and is likely to be adopted by trade unions in other industries.
Conclusions,To sum up, it appears that there are two measures which require to be considered immediately : 1. That, as proposed by the Coal Controller, 25,000 Grade I men, in addition to the remainder of the 25,000 low category miners, should he returned to the mines as soon as possible, and that their return should be expedited by every possible means and not delayed, as in the case of the latter, who were promised some time ago, but of whom only between 8,000 and 9,000 have been returned to the mines. These measures may not, however, be sufficient, and it is urged that the question of releasing a further quota of miners from the army during the winter months should be carefully considered. It may he pointed out that the coal trade is largely a seasonal trade, the greatest demand being in the winter when operations in the field are restricted. If another 50,000 miners could be promptly released at the end of October until, say, the end of February, it would materially ease the situation during the coming winter.2. Seeing that a certain amount of unemployment or reduced employment appears inevitable, steps should be taken at once to review the whole problem with the following objects in view : (a.) To schedule those industries in which considerable reductions are likely.(6.) To set up Joint Coal Rationing Committees for those industries. (In most of them Joint Industrial Councils, Joint Committees drafting constitutions for Councils, or Interim Reconstruction Committees already exist, which could easily take over the work. These bodies would cover fifty industries, including most of those which are not doing much Government work.)(c.) To provide for as equal a distribution of Government contracts as possible in each industry. .(d.) To devise a levy scheme for meeting unemployment in each industry and to consider in what manner State assistance should be given.GEO. H. ROBERTS.August 28, 1918.APPENDIX.Labour in the Coal Mining Industry during the War.THE organisation which controls the great majority of the coal miners of the country is the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain. This is a body composed of eighteen distinct local associations, one of which (the Midland Federation) is itself a Federation. Each local association is a separate organisation, and until now has possessed complete autonomy for local purposes.The typical organisation is very simple. There is in each centre a &quot;lodge&quot; : a group of lodges is a district; and a group of districts comprises a local association or Federation. This, in turn, along with the remaining seventeen associations, is a unit of the M.F.G.B. The local association (as, e.g. the S. Wales Miners&apos; Federation) is governed by an Executive Committee; but the decisions of the latter in matters of general policy have to be ratified by a conference of delegates from the lodges, and, if necessary, by a ballot of the coalfield.There are in the coal mines a number of non-unionists, and in some districts the non-union trouble occasionally becomes acute. There are also a number of smaller craft unions, comprising, e.g., surfacemen, colliery examiners, and other minor officials. Hence there arise from time to time demarcation disputes between these unions, and also disputes over the recognition of these unions by the employers. Thus in 1917 in Derbyshire there were disputes of the first type; and in the same year in S. Wales there were two disputes (S. Wales Colliery Examiners and the S. Wales Underground Firemen) of the second. The M.F.G.B., however, is organised as an industrial union; and although it does not accept into membership any of these craft unions, it is designed ultimately to include all workers in and about a coal mine. So it may be expected that with the disappearance of the craft unions, disputes of this sort will become less frequent,A
Another source of trouble arising from the constitution of the M.F.G.B. is that it includes a few men who are not actually engaged in coal mining. These, therefore, do not come under the jurisdiction of the Coal Controller, but under the Ministry of Munitions and other Departments. But the M.F.G.B. makes it part of its policy to press for the extension of the Coal Controller&apos;s awards to these external members. On the other hand, there are a few engineers engaged about certain pits (especially in pits which serve as central repairing shops for a group of pits) who prefer to be governed by the district rate of Engineers&apos; wages, which is generally higher than the rate for strictly colliery enginemen. The Federation does not appear to oppose their demands, and the Coal Controller, in cases where it can be shown that the men at a particular pit are primarily engineers, generally grants it. A case in point is the dispute which occurred (1917) among the enginemen at Twechar.Disputes of these kinds may all properly be classed as constitutional; and although in the aggregate they are numerous, they have no very important significance, and do not point to any deep-seated unrest. Nevertheless unrest appears to be a permanent feature of the mining industry, especially in certain centres, conspicuously S. Wales, Yorkshire, and Lanarkshire. To discover its causes one has to trace the history of the policy of the M.F.G.B. during the last few years.Over the whole country there have been three outstanding episodes. The first was the prolonged agitation for an 8-hours day, which culminated in the passage through Parliament in 1908 of the 8-hours day Act. The second was the struggle for a minimum wage, which was brought to a crisis by the coal strike of 1912, and the passage of an Act, establishing not, as the miners wished, a legal minimum wage over the whole industry, but boards to fix a legal minimum in each of the districts. Neither of these questions is to be considered as closed. But, as a preliminary to reopening them, the M.F.G.B. is at present moving in the direction of centralising all the machinery for dealing with general wages questions in the hands of the Federation. At present these are determined by local Conciliation Boards in each of the districts. The Federation proposes to do away with these, and establish a National Wages Board in their place. Once power is thus centralised, and the existing alliance between the M.F.G.B., the N.U.R., and the National Union of Transport Workers is consolidated, it is thought that the way will be open to a further advance.Perhaps the most obvious fact which has emerged during the war is the coincidence of a serious diminution in the total numbers employed at the pits and the pressure of the demand for coal. At the outbreak of war, there were just over 1,100,000 workers employed in and about the mines. By voluntary recruitment and successive combs-out, a number hardly, if at all, less than 400,000 has been withdrawn. In the early stages a considerable influx took place to the mines of men who were either physically unfit for military service or who wished to escape the Military Service Acts. Of the latter, very few now remain in the mines ; and the former would be no adequate compensation for the loss of the younger and stronger men, even if, as is not the case, they were anything like equal in numbers. The presence of these &quot; war &quot; miners has been a frequent cause of trouble in the combs-out. One Yorkshire union, e.g., wished to maintain that no genuine pre-war miner should be taken until all w-ho had entered the mines during the war, whatever their medical category, had been removed. The M.F.G.B., of course, did not uphold this extremist view; and, in general, it maybe said that the mining community has shown itself very willing to undertake all the military obligations which have been imposed upon it. In South Wales, e.g., the last comb-out (of March and April 1918) was anticipated by very large numbers of those who were likely to be affected by it; and the rush of voluntary recruits was far greater than the National Service organisation could deal with.But the result has been a serious falling off, not only in total output, but in the average output per man. And this, combined with the pressing need for coal, has given the men who remain a position of unparalleled economic strength, which they have not been unwilling to use. There have been several disputes of the first magnitude, and in almost every case the men have won on the issues by which they set most store.The campaign began very soon after the outbreak of war by a dispute in West Yorkshire over the interpretation of a decision by Judge Amphlett in July 1914 that the district minimum rate should be raised by 15 per cent. Many owners contended that this advance was in substitution for advances recently granted, and refused to pay these advances in addition to the new minimum. Negotiations dragged on through the autumn, but in January 1915 a ballot was taken to hand in notices at[749] G
the pits where the employers remained obdurate, with the result, that in February the employers gave in with tire proviso that the concession should he for the period of the war only.At the same time, all over the country an agitation, strongly resisted by the miners, was taking place to have the provisions of the Eight Hours Act set aside during the war period. A Home Office Departmental Committee was set up to consider the general question of coal-production, and reported at the end of May against this proposal, on the ground that it would not increase output. It reported also against the suggestion that women should be employed in greater numbers on the surface, and against the reduction of the age limit at which boys should be employed. In general, these recommendations have been insisted on throughout the war both by the Federation and until recently adhered to by the Government, though occasional disputes of short duration have been caused by the attempts of isolated owners to break through the second of these provisions.The first general movement towards securing a rise in wages took place in the spring of 1915. The M.F.G.B. demanded a general rise of 20 per cent, on earnings, and proposed (consistently with their policy of securing national agreements) a conference with the Mining Association of Great Britain. This, however, the employers refused, but, after long delay and negotiation, they were compelled to meet the M.F.G.B. on condition that this should not be regarded as a precedent, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The employers then offered 10 per cent., which the men rejected, but they decided to leave the 20 per cent, demand in the Prime Minister^ hands for arbitration. Mr. Asquith&apos;s award was that there was a case for an inimediate advance, but a distinct set-back for the Federation that the amounts should be decided locally. The local negotiations were conducted with varying success. Some districts (e.g., Northumberland and Durham) got small advances ; others obtained substantial increases.   But nowhere was the full 20 per cent. won.The next, indeed a simultaneous, step was the outcome of a decision of the Scarborough Conference of the M.F.G.B. in 1913. It had been decided then that all new agreements entered into by Conciliation Boards should terminate at the same time, subject to three months&apos; notice. And it had been decided that on 1st April, 1915, the three months&apos; notice would be given, so that the agreements should terminate on 30th June. Various points of a new programme were also determined, that a new standard rate of wages should be fixed, by merging all bonuses and percentages ; that a minimum wage of 5s. a day for all adult surface workers should be recognised, &amp;c. Finally, in February 19.15, in pursuance of this policy, the Executive of the M.F.G.B. resolved that no district agreement should be considered settled until it had been approved by the M.F.G.B. Employers and miners, therefore, in most areas began to negotiate new agreements more or less on these lines. But in South Wales difficulties at once appeared.The miners in March put forward the above demands, and also a demand that the workers on afternoon and night shifts should be paid upon the new standard at the rate of a turn and a fifth for each shift.The employers replied that it was undesirable to make a new agreement during the war, and urged the continuance of the old, in return for which concession they offered a 10 per cent, bonus. (This, of course, was contemporaneous with the national demand just described, for a 20 per cent, advance; from which, ultimately, the South Wales miners got 17^ per cent, advance on their standard.) The miners refused, and the owners forthwith declined to meet the men in conference. On 1st April notice to terminate the old agreement was given by the S.W.M.F., and during the three succeeding months no negotiations took place. Towards the end of June, just as a stoppage was about to take place, Air. Runciman, then President of the Board of Trade, intervened, and conferences were held in the last week of the month. On 30th June a delegation of three Labour members arrived in Cardiff (Mr. Henderson, Mr. Brace, and Mr. Roberts) and persuaded the men to accept Mr. Runciman&apos;s proposals as a basis for further negotiation, and to withdraw their notices for a fortnight. Mr. Runciman&apos;s proposals did not commend themselves to the men, though they offered certain improvements in the desired direction, and his interpretation of some doubtful points in his proposals was even less welcome. The result was that, at the expiration of the fortnight, a delegate conference decided by a large majority that &quot; we do not accept anything less than our original proposals ; and that we stop the collieries on Thursday next until these terms are conceded.&quot;The reply of the Government was to &quot; proclaim &quot; the South Wales coalfield under the Munitions of War Act. This attempt at coercion had no effect on the situation ; and on the appointed day 200,000 miners came out.   After the strike had lasted five
indays, Mr. Lloyd George went to Cardiff, and alter 2! hours&apos; negotiation, an agreement was reached, conceding the points on which the men had laid most stress. A further strike was threatened by the interpretation of this agreement given by Mr. Runciman, but on his revising his interpretation, the new agreement was signed. After this long struggle and. the signing of the new Conciliation Board agreements, the coal-mining industry was comparatively quiet. Local disputes were plentiful enough, due sometimes to bad temper on one side or the other, or to local grievances. But until late in 1916 there was no unrest which threatened to become serious. In November 1916, however, South Wales again became tlie storm-centre in a dispute which led to great changes in the control of the industry. In that month the men presented a demand to the Conciliation Board for a rise of 15 per cent, in wages, based on the increase in the selling price of coal. The owners lodged a counter-claim for a reduction of 10 per cent., on the ground of increased costs of production. The men, however, added further that they would not accept the decision of the independent chairman of the Board unless the employers agreed to an audit of their books by an independent auditor. The employers were unwilling ; and even when they were prepared to discuss the question, no agreement could be reached as to the appointment of the auditor. A strike appeared inevitable, when the Government intervened and announced that they would take over the control of the South Wales coalfield. Negotiations were continued &quot;between the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation and the President of the Board of Trade, which resulted in the giant of the men&apos;s demand for 15 per cent., subject to revision on the reports of an auditor appointed by the Government.   The award was not, in fact, withdrawn.It is noteworthy that the cost of living argument was not much stressed by the men in this dispute. It was quite frankly directed against the alleged excessive profits which the masters were making in spite of the Government action by fixing the price of coal, and by other measures. There is no doubt that a suspicion of capitalist &quot; profiteering &quot; has been one of the most unsettling factors in the industry.In a short time the Government announced the taking over of all the coalfields in Great Britain, and their administration by a Coal Controller under the direction of the President of the Board of Trade; and since early 1917, negotiations have been conducted between the M.F.G.B. directly with the Coal Controller.There have since been two demands for a rise in wages, both ultimately successful. But, in addition to these, there have been other causes of difficulty. Suspicion of profiteering, especially in- food, and anger at certain phases of food administration have produced sporadic outbursts, such as the one-day strike in Lanarkshire in August 1917. These might have been more serious if Lord Rhondda had not met the agents and explained his programme to them. Again, the recruiting question and the treatment of conscientious objectors gave rise to constant friction. Two combs-out were administered during the eighteen months February 19.17-July 1918. On both occasions (on the second occasion in spite of a ballot-vote against the comb-out) the Federation did not resist the Governments proposals ; and, on the second occasion, the machinery of the Federation was used to help in determining the incidence of the liability to military service. On the whole, the trouble on this account, considering the severity of the comb, the complication of labour introduced during the war, the difficulties of administration, and the strength of the mining interest, were not greater than might have been expected. The trouble, as usual, was largely in South Wales and Yorkshire. Again, difficulties of transport and shortage of wagons produced short time and hardship in many places, and iu certain districts, e.g., the anthracite district iu West Wales, where the quality of the coal was such that demand for it slackened, there were serious difficulties. The Coal Controller tried to meet these by re-organising transport; and the present situation is that, as regards export trade at least, ships are being held up for the want of coal. Moreover, he tried to establish &quot; Mobility Bureaux &quot; to effect the transfer.of men from coalfields which were slack to other coalfields and to other industries. But the M.F.G.B. rejected this scheme apparently largely because of the difficulty of miners carrying their rates with them, which condition they regarded as essential.The first general wage negotiation was initiated in July 1917, when the Glasgow conference of theM.F.G.B. decided to press for an increase to meet the rising cost of living. In August the executive of\the M.F.G.B. forwarded a demand for a 25 per cent, increase on existing gross rates. At a conference with the Coal Controller they were offered Is. ocl. a clay increase for men, and lid. for boys. This was rejected ; but in October the Controller gave a Avar wage\ of Is. fid. (and 9d.) a day, at the same time advancing the price of coal by 2s. fid. a torn   A few days later the award was extended[749] \ D
to allied trades, so that coke-oven and by-product members oil the M.F.G.B. also participated.A demand for a precisely similar award was made in June 1918 ; and after negotiations with the Coal Controller and the Prime Minister the award was granted as from 30th June to all workers under the jurisdiction of the Coal. Controller ; and an undertaking was given to press a similar advance on the Ministry of Munitions for all members of the M.F.G.B. under its control.   On the other hand, the miners agreed-(a.) To set up Pit-Committees to deal with avoidable absenteeism. (b.) To do all in their power to increase output.(c.) &quot; To give a general assurance that they would not be parties to another demand - for an increase, unless there was a substantial rise in the cost of living.&quot; Arrangements were made to discuss a basis on which the cost of living-should be estimated.The proposals afterwards submitted under (a) were ^&quot;approved by the Coal Controller, and by most of the owners, but were resisted by the South Wales owners. In this instance again, the men obtained the whole of their demands. Few strikes -wese arose out of either of these claims, though on both occasions, in South Stafford-shire, certain pits were closed for a few days by the men (against the advice of the leaders) in the belief that such a strike would help to expedite negotiations.Both these awards were flat rates given as an addition to a day&apos;s earnings ; and the Coal Controller gave them on the ground of increased cost of living. An attempt was made in July 1918 by the National Council of the Society of Mineworkers other than Miners to have the war-wage placed on a shift basis. But on the ground that this was a departure from the principle on which .the awards were based, the Coal Controller resisted it.This completes the record of the more or less official activities of the M.F.G.B., and, as has been noted, most of the advances were won before disputes actually reached the stage of a strike. The measure of success attending the efforts of the Federation may be judged from the following table of rates in the South Wales coalfields: 1.8.14 : 60 per cent, above the 1879 standard. 1.4.17: 133i1.7.18: 133-J   ,, ,, ,,        4- 3s. (and Is. 6d.) a day war-wage.Strikes were, of course, a matter of daily occurrence somwhere or other in the coalfields. But these were due either to attempts to get a sectional increase, which the Controller generally succeeded in resisting, or to. one or other of the various subordinate causes which have been mentioned ; and though some of them involved a large number of men for a few days, none of them raised any large issue of principle.But before the record of the labour situation is taken as complete, mention must be made of the activity of the &quot; unofficial&quot; leaders in various parts, especially in South Wales, aa4 their success in one big dispute and their influence on the immediate programme of the M.F.G.B.The &quot; unofficial&quot; movement in the coal-industry has its counterpart in other industries. The shop-steward question is more or less of the same sort. But in most cases there is a definite reason for the existence of shop-stewards in the fact that the present organisation of the Unions does not enable all the men in one shop to act as a unit in shop-disputes. Primd facie, there is no reason why room should not be found in Trade Union organisation for the shop-stewards; and though, in fact, as in the case of the Clyde &quot; unofficial committee,&quot; the movement tends to take the form of a revolt against constituted authority in the Trade Unions, it need not necessarily do so. In the coalfield the situation is different. The regular Union organisation covers practically the whole industry ; and there is no difficulty in the men employed at any particular pit presenting a case as a unit. Hence the unofficial movement is necessarily and professedly a revolt against the older leaders of the Trade Union movement.The symptoms are observable in practically every part of the coal-field. In Lanarkshire, e.g., it was an unofficial committee which carried out the one day strikes at the time of the food difficulties. But they are most acute in South Wales; and it is there that the unofficial movement has scored its most distinct successes. It may be convenient, therefore, to confine these observations mainly to that area.
South Wales, is in many ways, a peculiar area. The coal is at once very valuable, and, in parts, dangerous to work. The geographical structure of the region makes housing and communications difficult, and in many places the housing is shocking. There is in the eastern part of the coal-field no competing industry of any importance. And there is a tradition of bitter hostility between owners and men, accentuated first by the great combinations initiated by Lord Rhondda&apos;s Cambrian Combine, and secondly by the very large profits which most of the companies have made during the war. Disputes in South Wales have often been extremely violent, and the illfeeling has been iucreased by the frequent appeal of the oAvners for Government protection. Thus in 1912, many metropolitan police and even troops were drafted into the area, and in the same way, the j)roolamatioii of the coal-field in .1915 produced great indignation.It is not surprising in view of these facts that South Wales has always been in the front of the &quot; advanced&quot; movement. Syndicalist ideas found their earliest and most fruitful seeding ground in South Wales, and the Upper Rhondda was the scene not only of considerable syndicalist disturbances, but of the production of some very effective syndicalist tracts and propaganda. &quot; The miners&apos; next step,&quot; published at Tonypandy, is perhaps the most famous of these. As early as 1912, the syndicalist element in the coal-field formed an advanced wing in the Federation, pressing a policy of open expropriation of the coal-owners, and the assumption of the ownership and control of the coal mines by the Federation ; as against the traditional policy of steady reforms and a movement in the direction of State Socialism. The constitution of the Federation whereby matters of policy were either initiated by or referred to the lodges gave these &quot; extremists &quot; a power out of proportion to their numerical strength. For they were active, while the mass of the miners were lethargic; and they showed remarkable tactical skill in the manipulation of the weekly meetings of the lodges. When matters came to a ballot of the coal-field, they were always beaten; often overwhelmed.   But their influence was undoubtedly felt.The growth of the Central Labour College movement in South Wales, and the spread of Marxian economics brought them further accessions of strength, and the out-break of war, while it reinforced them by the relatively small but very active pacifist element, withdrew from the other side a large number of the most vigorously loyal members. One sees the fruit of this in their snatch victorv in the second ballot of the coal-field on the question of the comb-out.It should be said at once that the genuinely pacifist feeling in South Wales is not of much account, though there is a general demand that the Government should adopt and press on the Allies, the Labour Party&apos;s war aims. Whenever a crisis comes, South Wales, like the other coalfields, is solidly pro-war. The Merthyr election, General Smuts&apos; visit, the tremendous voluntary recruitment after the German victory of 21st March, and any number of other incidents, furnish proof enough But a lull in the military struggle, and still more a period of Allied success, always bring to the front the number of those who are anxious to use the war and everything else as an instrument against the owners. Hence, on occasion, they poll a surprisingly darge vote.All these various forces have combined to give this &quot; unofficiai movement&quot; very considerable power in the South. Wales area, and it has recently begun directly to challenge the official forces. Part of its programme is to exclude from the Executive Council of the S. W.M.F. all &quot; officials,&quot; on the ground that when officials rule democratic government is impossible. But it has not succeeded in carrying this policy, nor has it succeeded in getting any considerable representation on the Executive of the S.W.M.F., though recent elections displayed a considerable increase of its voting power, and three candidates came very near election. On the other hand, it has succeeded in getting one or two of the leaders made miners&apos; agents. Mr. Noah Ablett&apos;s election was the first success of this kind. It has, moreover, met with some success in its campaign for the abolition of payment by tonnage. The programme definitely is to establish a minimum weekly wrage, equivalent to the present high wage, based on output, reduce the week to five days, and the day to six hours. Then wdien these concessions are secured, the men will &quot; ca canny,&quot; thereby sweeping profits, and with them owners, out of the trade.The most direct trial of strength, however, took place in the Tredegar and Ebbw Vale strikes in May of this year. A &quot; Combine Committee &quot; wras formed among the men, largely composed of the &quot; unofficial &quot; element, and covering the collieries of the Tredegar group. This was represented to be analogous to the shop steward movement which had already been &quot;recognised &quot; in engineering, but strictly speaking, as has been
pointed out, it is not so. A dispute broke out in the Tredegar&apos; group about working&apos; in an alleged dangerous place, and the Combine Committee attempted to negotiate directly with the managing director. They were refused an interview, and 8,000 men came out.A. similar incident occurred in theEhymney Valley, but there, the men instead of striking, appealed to the Coal Controller, who is reported to have received a deputation of the committee, and to have secured their recognition by the management. After this incident, and at the suggestion of. the Coal Controller, the Tredegar management agreed to receive a deputation from the Tredegar Combine Committee after the men returned to work, and this solution was accepted by the Executive of the S.W.M.F., who advised the men to return to work. The men, however, insisted on holding the meeting with the management before, the return to work, and the Ebbw Vale miners came out on strike in sympathy with this demand. The result was that some 50,000 miners were out, and the Coal Controller finally gave way, and reluctantly sanctioned a meeting before the men went back.Undoubtedly this constitutes a decided victory for the unofficial reformers, not only over the management and the Government, but over the Executive of the S.W.M.F. And their power to bring all the pits in a large area to a standstill is the most striking demonstration of the influence Avhich they now possess. The feeling between the Executive and the unofficial reformers is very strong, and it is quite evident that the fight is not yet over.The success not only of their own movement, but of the M.F.G.13. in getting substantial wages increases, has convinced the men that they are in an impregnably strong position. They are indifferent to public opinion, indeed it hardly ever reaches them. They have, as they hold, the sanction of the capitalists example, for exploiting their present economic advantage to the full, and it will be difficult to restrain them.The pressure which these men (and the trend of events) are exercising on the general coalmining situation is clearly enough shown in the resolutions of the South-port conference of the M.F.G.B. in July of this year. They are more drastic, though in line with previous policy ; and there is a stronger temper behind them. The standing resolution in favour of the nationalisation of the coal mines e.c/., has been backed this year by a later resolution of the Northumberland miners to down tools if the mines are not nationalised within six months after the end of the war. Similarly the Conference has pronounced in favour of centralising the machinery for dealing with wages questions, which will undoubtedly tend towards an equalisation of wages over the whole industry, and the shutting down of the less profitable mines. It demands also a six day Avage for a five day week, and proposes a special conference, first of the M.F.G.B., and subsequently of the triple alliance to secure legislation for a six hour clay within four weeks of the declaration of peace. It has decided also that no district authority shall make any agreement which would result in a reduction of wages after the war below the level which, with all special additions, they have reached during the war.This programme, however, does not fulfil the ambitions of the advanced group (which include a demand for the immediate ownership and control of the means of production) though that group certainly had some share in shaping it. It is to be expected that they will not wait until the end of the war, but begin operations at once to secure its effective realisation. No doubt they will have some success, especially if the military news continues to be favourable. But, in estimating the force of this movement, it has to be remembered that the great bulk of opinion in the Federation will not be in favour of doing anything which would injure the Allied cause, and that is perhaps the best hope for the future. But it would be foolish to underestimate the power of men, who, though a minority, are yet sufficiently strong to impede and sometimes to bring to a standstill, the work of coal production.
