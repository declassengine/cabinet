NORTH SEA.OPERATIONS (OTHER THAN ANTI-SUBMARINE) CARRIED OUT BY AIRCRAFT DURING JUNE 1918.June ith.Yarmouth. Five Large America seaplanes, whilst on hostile aircraft patrol, encountered a hostile aircraft.One of our seaplanes, No. 4533, landed in the sea off Terschelling, at 1518, owing to engine trouble, and the rest of the formation circled round Avaiting for No. 4533 to make repairs and carry on. At 1550 a patrol of five German machines was sighted and attacked. The enemy retreated and our machines gave up the chase and returned to the temporarily disabled seaplane, which they protected until 1700, when they were compelled to attack a newly arrived formation of 12 enemy machines. During this encounter Seaplane No. 8C89 was badly hit and was forced to land off Vlieland, where it was interned. No. 4533 was unable to effect repairs and join in the attack. While still resting on the water, it was attacked by two two-seater enemy machines. No. 4533 fired from the water and forced a German machine to alight on the sea, which machine was destroyed by (ire by an accompanying enemy machine. At 1722 the guns of No. 4533 seized up and the machine was left defenceless. The wind and current were carrying this seaplane towards Dutch territorial waters, and international distress signals were fired (which were seen by the Dutch).When 30 yards from shore the machine was set on fire and was burnt level with the water ; the only part remaining being 20 feet of the port wing.June Qth.Felixstowe. Large &quot;America seaplane No. 4345, whilst on patrol, sighted five hostile aircraft steering north at a height of about 200 feet. The port engine was badly damaged by a stray shot, and the seaplane made a forced landing in the sea.The enemy machines landed near by, and left later without firing at the disabled seaplane, as has been their usual custom.The machine was totally wrecked, but the crew were eventually rescued by Large America seaplanes sent out from Felixstowe.June 7th.Yarmouth-Aeroplane B.E. 2 C No. 8417 (Pilot Lieut.

No. 5 GROUP DOVER PATROL (OVERSEAS UNIT).Luring the first two weeks of the month the weather was generally favourable for flying, but during the latter part of the month flying was considerably curtailed owing to bad weather.In the first week No. 82 Wing was formed and taken on strength of No. 5 Group under the command of Lieutenant Colonel R. II. Mulock, D.S.O. The wing comprises one squadron of Handley Pages, one squadron of F.E. 2 B&apos;s, and one of D.H. 9&apos;s.Photographic, W/T, and coastal reconnaissances have been fully maintained. Photographs taken evidence the damage caused by bomb raids and confirm that the T.B.D. claimed to have been sunk by No. 217 Squadron is actually sunk off Zeebrugge Mole.The sheds at Brugeoise Works engaged in submarine building and munition work have been completely wrecked. Photographs show that an attempt to clear the Fairway at Zeebrugge by blowing up the block ship &quot;Thetis&quot; failed, although one side of the &quot; Thetis&quot; was blown in. Other photographs have given information of considerable interest, foremost among which is the construction of a new floating dock alongside the canal at Dudzeele- Bridge, Zeebrugge, a new railway between this canal and Coolkerke, and a new aerodrome north of Stalhille, about 1 mile south of Vlissen-ghem Aerodrome., There are five completed hangars (Besson-neaux type), and one under construction at this new aerodrome, and to the N.E. there appears to be an A.A. battery under construction.bombing raids.Continuous and effective bombing i raids have been main-tained during the month, and objects of military importanceo  (33) AS 6019  Pk 375  8/18   E &amp; S A 2Sands, was attacked by five enemy seaplanes. The B.E., which was only armed with bombs, managed to elude the enemy fire. At 0545 Short seaplane No. 1693 was sighted. The enemy immediately left the B.E. and attacked the Short, which was forced to land beside two motor launches. The latter opened fire on the enemy, but did not succeed in driving them off. The Short seaplane was eventually sunk by gunfire from the enemy machines, and the pilot andobserver (Lieutenant Ivermee and Observer Private Bourne W/T), who sustained flesh wounds, were rescued by the motor launches and landed at Yarmouth.
and enemy shipping have been attacked with success. Several direct hits have been scored on the Mole at Zeebrugge. Direct hits have been obtained on a ship 4- miles S.W. of Ostende Harbour ; on a ship in the Fairway, Zeebrugge, and on another three miles off this port; on bow of a trawler anchored in the harbour alongside the Mole, and eight bursts round a destroyer leaving harbour; the latter was attacked by machine-gun (ire.Units, other than 5th Group, have ably co-operated in these bombing raids.The summary of bombs dropped during these operations is given in page 6.Although absolute reliance cannot be placed on reports from agents, it is interesting to note that they report that at Bruges Docks two large torpedo boats were struck aft and practically blown to pieces; that on the night of 30-31 May bombs dropped on La Brugeoise Works caused a big fire which lasted three hours, and that the munition depot was blown up, and about 200 soldiers and several civilians killed.ENEMY AIRCRAFT.Attacks on our reconnaissance and bombing formations have been fairly frequent. During the engagements 11 enemy machines have been destroyed ; 31 driven down.   Total 42.The engagements of particular interest are as follows :-On June 1st a patrol of No. 217 Squadron sighted two enemy scouts and four two-seater seaplanes. Lieutenant Bingham attacked one of the two-seaters and saw it go down in a steep dive, meantime Lieutenant Bridges was being attacked by two machines. One of these two machines stalled after one pan of ammunition had been fired into it fell over on one side and went down out of control.Thirty enemy aircraft attacked our bombing formations on June 30th, a lively fight ensued; and Captain Enstowe shot down a Fokker biplane in flames, then attacked another machine which collided with one of our fighters; both machines fell locked together.Other enemy machines were shot down out of control by Captain Burt, Captain Gossip, Captain Tonke, Captain Hunter, Lieutenant Pomeroy, Lieutenant Lumley, Lieutenant Gordon, 2nd Lieutenant Iiickey, and Lieutenant Mesliam; the rest of the enemy machines broke off the fight.On June 15th Captain Pinder, Lieutenant A. R. Talbot, and Lieutenant C. P. Sparks of 213 Squadron attacked a new type Hanneveraner. The machine was a two-seater with doiible tail, 1 violet wings, and white markings on tail. Armament con-sisted of two guns forward and one aft. The machine was faster than the Camels, but was driven down out of control behind the enemy lines.
ENEMY RAIDS AGAINST OUR AERODROMES.The enemy have raided our aerodromes on several occasions during the month.The most serious of these were on the nights of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 29th-30th June. Upwards of 300 bombs were dropped, and considerable material damage was done both to hangars, works, and machines.The casualties totalled one officer and four men killed.,,     one and seven men wounded.The following pilots and observers have accounted for enemy machines during tho month :-Lieut.

The details of attacks carried out are as follows:  June 3rd.Houghton Bay.-Large America Seaplane No. 4247 (Pilot Captain E. A. Wilson), whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine at 2117 12 miles east of Dennis Head. A Very&apos;s light was fired from the seaplane, hut no reply was received from the sub-marine, which was submerging rapidly.Two 230-lb, bombs were dropped, which exploded 25 and 10 yards respectively short of the white swirl made by the submarine which had completely submerged before the bombs exploded.As a result a quantity of oil and air bubbles rose to the surface, also timber was seen to be floating on the surface in the centre of the oil. patch. The seaplane remained in the vicinity for 40 minutes, but nothing further was seen.J une 3rd.Dundee. Large America Seaplane N. 4066 (Pilots Captain W. R. Kenny, Captain N. H. Woodhead), whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine at 2045 in position 560 50&apos; N., I0 15&apos; W. Two 230-lb. bombs were dropped about 500 feet ahead and slightly to the east of the wake which &quot;the submarine left behind on submerging.The seaplane remained in the vicinity for about 15 minutes, but as nothing more was observed it returned to base.Owing to the thickness of the weather at the time, details cannot be given of the appearance of the submarine, but from the wash it left it appeared to be.of a large type.JuneCramlington. - Aeroplane D.H. 6 6883 (Pilot Captain Walker), whilst on patrol, sighted at 2015 a periscope breaking the water about 7 miles S.E. of Cress well.One bomb was dropped which exploded about 100 feet ahead of the spot where the periscope disappeared. No results were observed.June Stli.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane No. 9972 (Pilot, Lieut. R. R. Richardson ; Observer, Lieut. Hirst), whilst on patrol, at 1042, sighted a submarine on the surface in position n0o 43&apos; N., 0o 42&apos; W.When the aeroplane arrived over the submarine, the periscope was still well above the water. One 230-lb. bomb was dropped from a height of 1,000 feet, which fell directly on the periscope. Thirty seconds later a second 230-lb. bomb was dropped -on approximately the same spot. Both bombs detonated and resulted in oil and air bubbles rising to the o  AS(JOIS)   . A 3
surface in great quantities. After patrolling the area for an hour the aeroplane returned to base, leaving I.T.M.S. &quot;Cicala&quot; with a Kite Balloon on patrol.June 8th,killingholme.-Large America Seaplane No. 4350 (Pilots, Captain Munday, Ensign Rumill), whilst on patrol, at 0950, sighted the periscope of a submarine in position 15 miles due E. of Spurn.The periscope disappeared almost immediately and the seaplane steered for the position of the wake and observed a disturbance of the water as if the submarine were lying on the bottom.   Bubbles were seen to be rising.Two bombs were dropped, one falling on the tail and a little to one side of the disturbance and the other on the Lead of the swirl; Whereupon much more bubbles and also oil came to the surface. No further results were observed. Owing to lack of fuel the seaplane was obliged to return to base.June Sth.yarmouth.-Large America Seaplane No. 4512 (Pilots, Captain Bolton and Ensign Teulon, Q.S.N.), whilst on patrol, searching for reported submarine, at 1550, sighted the enemy straight ahead, five miles distant. On reaching the position the submarine had disappeared ; two bombs were dropped, one of which failed to explode and the other exploded 100 feet north of the wash, which was still visible. Nothing further was seen of the submarine, which was of the U 51-56 class, having a long-almost straight deck with a large conning tower amidships and was painted a dull, dirty grey colour. Owing to the distance at which the submarine was first sighted it was impossible to observe many details of the craft.June 9th.Prawle.-Aeroplane .D.II. 9 .1085 (Pilot, Captain R. R. Thornley, Observer, A. M. Ford, W/T), whilst on patrol, at . 0453, sighted a large enemy submarine in position 50o 17&apos; N., 30 05&apos; W., two 230-lb. bombs were dropped one immediately after the submarine dived, the other 30 seconds later, which exploded 20 and 100 feet ahead of the spot where she dis-appeared. Several small patches of oil were observed after the explosion but no wreckage, and it would not appear that the submarine was materially damaged.June 11th.cattewater-Short Seaplane No. 2959 (Pilot, hi. It. L. Pallett; Observer, Lieut. A. (i. Bishop), whilst on patrol, at 1540, sighted a periscope breaking surface in position 530 10&apos; N., 3D 10&apos; W. One minute later the periscope disappeared. OnelOO-lb. bomb was dropped on the swirl within three minutes of the sighting, whereupon the water became disturbed and air bubbles rose to
the surface. Three seconds later a 230-lb. bomb was dropped, which failed to detonate.. Eight minutes later a British sub-marine appeared on the surface and communication was established between them and information given to the sub-marine by the seaplane with regard to the enemy submarine. The seaplane searched the vicinity for 45 minutes, but nothing further was observed.June 1Mb. vSeaton Carew.-Aeroplane No. 9972 (Pilot, Lieut. R. R. Richardson), whilst on special patrol to search for a hostile submarine reported to be in the vicinity of Scarborough and Seaham, sighted the periscope of a submarine proceeding north, one mile, to starboard bow in position 540 48&apos; N., I0 10&apos; YV. The aeroplane altered course to attack, and at 1035 a 230-lb. bomb (2-f seconds delay) was released, which exploded approxi-mately 20 to 30 feet to starboard of the wash of a submarine whose periscope was not then visible. At 1039 a second bomb was released within the radius of the first. Both bombs detonated.A patch of oil and air bubbles were observed as a result of the bombing. The position of the submarine was reported to ILM.S. Drifter &quot; Floris,&quot; who proceeded at once to the position indicated by the aeroplane and dropped two depth charges. Nothing further was observed and No. 9972 returned to base at 1145 and reported.June ldlh.Seaton Carew.-Aeroplane RE. 2 B. A. 5542 (Pilot, Lieut. Toyne ; Observer, A. M. Taplin), whilst on escort patrol, at 0040, sighted the periscope of a submarine three miles away in a position almost ahead of a convoy.Two bombs were dropped on the patch of thick oil left on the spot where the periscope was sighted.- The first bomb fell in the oil patch and the second within the radius of the first. Oil and bubbles rose to the surface as a result of the bombing.June 2ith.Redcar-Aeroplane D.H. 6 No. 6882 (Pilot, Lieut. Burton), whilst on patrol, at 1848, sighted the periscope of a submarine off &quot;H &quot; Buoy in Tees Bay. A bomb Avas dropped and Very&apos;s lights fired. The latter Avas answered by a destroyer coming to the spot and dropping depth charges. Nothing further was observed. (No further details of this attack have been received.)June 25th.Portland,-Wight Seaplane No. 9841 (Pilot, Captain Jarman ; Observer Lieut. Read), whilst on escort patrol, at 1220, sighted a submarine breaking surface in 24 L. Three bombs Avere dropped; the first fell 50 feet astern of the wake, the second 100 feet ahead of the Avake, and the third fell near the ripples in the track.
Oil bubbles and reddish-brown and white residue came to the surface. Nothing further was observed. The submarine was grey with two periscopes.   No. W/T was visible.June 2Qth.Killingholme.-Large America Seaplane No. 4287 (Pilot, Ensign Schufellin), whilst on patrol, sighted the conning tower of a submarine when three miles distant in position 530 33&apos; N., O0 59&apos; E. The submarine submerged rapidly while the seaplane was still li- miles away and started to move slowly westward. Two 230-lb. bombs were dropped on the position, where the submarine submerged, which burst 150 and 200 feet respec-tively from the hull of the submarine. Nothing further was observed and the seaplane returned to base.Only the conning tower (which was painted black) of the submarine was seen.June 2&amp;th.Killingholme.-Large America Seaplane No. 4287 (Pilot, Lt. L. R. V. Lynch), whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine awash, in position 54G 29&apos; N., 0o 20&apos; E., which immediately submerged.Two bombs were dropped from an altitude of 400 feet, which fell on either side of the course the submarine had apparently taken.The position of. the submarine was sent to base, and, after circling the position for 15 minutes and observing nothing further, the seaplane returned to Killingholme.June 27thj2Sth.Dunkirk.-Submarines were sighted and attacked on these dates by aircraft.  No details have&apos; been received.TABLE &quot;A.&quot;Seaplanes and Aeroplanes.					Submarines.	Station.	No. of		Miles	Escorts.			Patrols.	Time.	covered..		Sighted.	Attacked.Orkneys: 		Hrs.

A second bomb was dropped in the same position, which was followed by a rush of air bubbles lasting about 20 seconds. The third bomb failed to explode. Surface craft dropped depth charges, and drifters reported that the sound of submarine engines, which was previously heard on the hydrophones, had stopped after the bombing. The area was patrolled until 1115, when C. Star 4 was relieved by C. Star 2 and returned to base.June 5th.Anglesey. Airship S.S. Z. 50 (Pilot Lieut. A. J. O. Farina), whilst on patrol, sighted a submarine, at 0944, in position 530 43&apos; N., 40 55&apos; W., which opened fire on the airship with four rounds in quick succession.The airship steered for position astern of the submarine, which was steering east at about 15 to 20 knots and fired her Lewis gun, to which the submarine replied by firing eight more rounds. S.S. Z. 50 was, by this time, astern of the submarine and chasing her at full speed. Three men were seen to be manning the gun aft. The submarine began to submerge and dived from sight in less than a minute.S.S. Z. 50 then dropped a 230-lb. bomb from a height of1,500 feet.Owing to the fact that the airship was travelling at a speed of 45 knots and that visibility was gradually decreasing, the spot could not he picked up again.After patrolling the area for 30 minutes the airship returned to base.   Nothing further was observed.The submarine was at least 200 feet long. The hull was painted light grey and the deck light brown. It is-assumed that several permanent objects (about 16) were on the deck, as a corresponding number of feathers were made in the water when the deck was just below the surface.

At 0848 the submarine started to submerge. The balloon was asked to con ship so as to bring the submarine ahead, speed being
increased to 25 knots. The submarine trimmed until the conning tower alone was visible and remained so for about two minutes, and could then be seen no longer even with binoculars. The enemy was visible for about three or four minutes, after the ship had been steaming towards it at 25 knots, when it still seemed two or three miles ahead, thus indicating that distance had been considerably under-estimated.On reaching the position where the submarine was last seen, four depth charges were dropped set at 100 feet, one of which failed to explode.H.M.S. &quot;Morning Star&quot; ran on for another three miles, turned, and steamed, over the patch formed by the explosion  no oil 0]&apos; other indication of wreckage was seen from the balloon.The conning tower and the hull of the submarine were both visible at first no deck was visible and no periscope could be made out. The submarine was not observed from the ship.Surface craft were observed approximately 3 to 5 miles from the position of the submarine.Table &quot;C.&quot;Kite Balloons.					Subm	Station.
