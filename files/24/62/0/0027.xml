BORE T.-r17-5527,WAR    Qi;3IHEf(   . SITUATION     IN     NORTH     RUSSIA..0149/5429.&apos; The Socrotary,V/cir Cabinet,I forward herewith a copy of a telegram No,855 from the Rear Admiral, White boa, Murmansk, relative to the Military situation in North Russia,,I should bo glad if this telegram could be considered by the !Var Cabinet,I am of opinion that in view of the fact that the forces to be employed were defined by the Supreme War xSeo Council,x this telegram should be forwarded at once to1,0.70, the Military Representatives at Versailles for theirconsideration and report..(Signed), P. do B. Radcliffo. General Staff, DJvLO.&apos; Y/ar Office, . for Col, G.S,27th August, 1918,IE CYPHER OF TEL GRAIvj. From :- Rear Admiral, White Sea, Murmansk.To Admiralty, 26th August, 1918.855.   Very Secret.      - 1 &quot;I think it my duty to inform you in the plainest way that in my opinion the Military situation both in the Murmansk (?Peninsula) and Archangel will be.very serious unless considerable reinforcements in excess of those already detailed are sent before the end of October. The following takes into consideration all reinforcements contemplated at present.   With regard to Syren forces present intention is to with-draw all troops from south of Zandalaksha and also from Peohenga, I consider such withdrawals would be politically disastrous as it would deliver over to a blood thirsty enemy those whom we are morally and in honour hound to defend.   In order to obviate this necessity a further reinforcement of five thousand troops is required for Syren force. With regard to Elope force would point out the expedition to Kotlas in addition to the original proposed expedition to Vologda has very ]arge-ly increased the scope of our liabilities. I consider.-every effort should be made to provide reinforcements for the Llope force. The delay in sending out the, reinforcements originally authorised has largely deprived us of the advantages of surprise and has (?given) the oppor-tunity to the enemy to consolidate and concentrate,   I am quite aware iii sending remarks that these points are primarily for the consider^ tion of the General Commanding.   I consider it however the duty of every Englishman of responsible position to state his opinions (?on) matters vitally concerning the interests of the allied cause. I am cor^inoed reinforcements are vitally necessary to us out hero and withouu being a soldier it is to me a matter of common sense that reinforcements sufficient to make our position out here comparatively safe can be spared without unduly prejudicing the Military position elsewhere. I submit that this telegram may be laid before the Cabinet without delay. Re quo st acknowledgment,.HIS DOCUIVIEI^J lo THE PROPERTY OF gig BRIiEU^ilC LiAJhoTTS OOVBKHWEflTjii
