iIH?L22 Hment ls the Property cREPORT RELATING TO THE WAR WORK OF THE BOARD OF AGP I CULTURE FOR SCOTLAND FOP; THE WEEK ENDING AUGUST 26TH 1918.FOOD PRODUCTION.Harvest operations are now general except in the later districts.    Unfortunately the weather ha3 been broken, and a good deal of rain has fallen, as much as 2.39 inches in 24 hbura being reported from Dumftiesshire.    Leading in has been commenced and given favourable weather the prospects are very satisfactory.1* District Agricultural Executive Committees.The Ayrshire Committee has resigned: and the County Clerkhas been asked to constitute a new one.    All the other Committees are carrying on without change.Sulphate of Ammonia.It is estimated that there will be an increased pro-:duction in Great Britain of Sulphate of Ammonia during the period September to November 1918.    Por the period June to August, the quota allotted to Scotland was 10,000 tons.    According to statistics collected&apos; by the Board, the quantity of Sulphate of Ammonia used for agricultural purposes in Scotland last year was slightly over 60,000 tons.    On this basis representations have been made with a vie* to increasing the quantity to be allocated to Scotland for the second period, and in consequence, an additional 5,000 tone will be made available, making a total for the period of 15,000 tons.(b) Potash z Blast Furnace Flue Dust.Revised arrangements have been made for a supply fromEnglish works of the higher grades of Blast Furnace. Flue Dust for use in Scotland.    The Board ha-ve appointed Messrs* J. &amp;Cunningham, Limited. Leiths to act as their distributing agents, and farmers are being advised by press notice and leaflet to intimate- particulars; of their requirements to that Firm before 30th September. 1918, after which date an allocation of the total supplies will be made for use in potato and flax-growing districts-A definite quantity of Flue Dust will be reserved for flax-growers in the Fifeshire area..3;. Supply of Labour. lajrj^rve^tr^bour.* Complaints continue to be received from District Agri-: cultural Executive Committees as to the class of men released by the War Office for harvest work.The Board have circularised Committees informing them of the arrangements contained in Army Council Instruction No. 879 of 1918, whereby applications for harvest labour are to be made through the Local Sub-Commissioner of the Ministry.of National Service who will approach the local Military Agricultural Commandant direct.(b) Rabbit Trappers.A /
2.A circular with regard to rabbit trappers has also been addressed to Committees, who have been asked to supply particulars of any such men of low medical category at present in the Army and also information as to the need for rabbit trappers in the district The Board propose, on receipt of this information to co-operate with, the Ministry of Pood in pressing for the release of suitable men.4. Supply of Agricultural Ifoohinery. -Binders,The demand for binders to be used with horses belonging to farmers and not with the Boards horses or tractors, has been larger thanws anticipated but as the Board ha&amp; a, reserve stock of binders on hand praotically all requirements have been met,    All the binders have now been delivered to the various districts with the exception of a few for the northern counties where the harvest has not yet commenced,    These are being forwarded this week.5. Supply of Potato Baskets,The Board have received representations from potato-growers as to the difficulty at present being experienced in obta^ ring sufficient supplies of potato ba&amp;kete for use in lifting this seasons crop. The supply of material for basket-making is limited, and owing to the increased acreage under potatoes, the number of baskets available is insufficient,to meet requirements, On considering the means of meeting this shortage the Board though it possible that fruit-growers might have in stock baskets that tfould be suitable for the purpose, and various representatives of the fruit trade were accordingly communicated with on,the point. A reply has now been received from the Secretary o ,the Pederationj of Wholesale Pruit &amp; Vegetable Trade Associations, Glasgow, &quot;offer!) to supply 1000 half-bushel baskets at a price of 3/- each.This offer is being communicated to potato growers.!6. Beekeeping. Supply of Suffar for Bees, 1Representations have been made to the Board from time.to time during the last two years as to the unsuitability and the hig price of the medicated bee candy manufactured by Messrs. Pats call, London, who have been in receipt of special issues of sugar for tlj purpose. .The Board approached the Ministry of Pood last year witlj a vievY to obtaining a quantity of unmedicated sugar for supply to I bee-keepers in Scotland, but that Department was unable&apos; to see iti way to accede to the request. Bepresentations were again made ti the Ministry recently, and it was suggested (1)&quot; that as the majority of bee-keepers in Scotland are known to the Instructors tho Agricultural Colleges or to the Soottieh Bee-Keepero Associat the distribution of unmedicated sugar to, bee-keepers oould be und* :taken, with proper safeguards, by the Colleges, in consultation with the Association; (3) that, as at the present:time bee*keeperel are much concerned ;for the safety-of their stocks, any precaution! for safeguarding the proper use of the sugar after coming into their hands is hardly necessary, but&apos; that in order to obviate any possibility of its improper use it might be denatured by the admixture of sand before distribution. The amount of sugar whiclj would be required for Scotland is esttmted at 16 tons.It/ S *
IEIt, may be added that Bee-keepers in Scotland have suffered considerable losses during the past few years through the ravages of Isle of Wight Disease, and it is essential that every effort should now be made to bring up.stocks to their normal level.   , Further, at the present time an increasing number of discharged soldiers and sailors,is being trained in agriculture with a view to their becoming smallholders, and ae bee-keeping is one of the most important subsidiary occupations which they wilj. follow in that capacity the importance of increasing the stocks of bees in the country is thus greatly increased.7ne Board have now received a reply from the Ministry of Pood to the effect that the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries are at present experimenting with sugar which has been specially denatured by the Government Chemist, and that, pending the result of the experiments, further supplies of sugar are being allotted to Messrs. Pascall.    The Ministry fear, however, that they will be unable to recommend to the Sugar Commission the allocation for bee*feeding of sugar which has not been denatured.7. Impprtation^of Seeds from the United States of America.Regulations hare recently been issued requiring that before parcels of seeds can be purchased in the United States of America for importation to this country a permit must be obtained from the Department of Import Restrictions.    As such a procedure ie likely to lead to serious delay, the latter Department has now agreed to issue for the information of the Britieh War Mission general permits covering the total quantity of seeds which each seed house will probably wish.to purchase in the United States of America up to 3lst May next.    The necessary particulars are now being obtained from the firms concerned.8* Sale of Horsee Order.-Under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2T regarding the sale of agricultural horses 606 licences to sell horses belonging to farmers have been Issued during the week.    The total number of licences issued by the Board since the Order came into Operation is 35,197.9. Heavy fforse  reeding.The depletion of the etock of heavy horses in Scotland owing to the demands of the military authorities and the discovery that an undue percentage of the horses so impressed were unsound and should never have been bred, have led the Board to devote special attention to the furtherance of their Schemes for the encouragement of heavy horse breeding and for the registration of stallions.These Schemes are complementary and have for their primary object the production of a type of horse which shall be suitable for agricultural purposes and which shall at the same time meet the requirements of the military authorities.The method by which the Board seek to Obtain this object is to grant financial assistance to certain horse breeding societies to enable them to provide, at low fees, registered stallions for the service of mares belonging to small farmers, who /
who would otherwise he tempted to hffe their mares served by inferior, low priced etallione.The provision of these registered stallione at low fees has the double effect of encouraging swall farmers to btA. from the tyeat type of marej it. the knowledge tiiat they will have the use of superior stallions for the service of their mares, and of tending to eliminate the inferior stallions by rendering the travelling fox service of such stallions an un -profitable commercial transaction.Zn considering the degree of success which has atter.the Board&apos;8 efforts under these Schemes it should be home inmind that the funds at their disposal are limited, and that alarge number of mares which in normal timee would.be,available for breeding purposes have been withdrawn for agricultural woiNevertheless the Board are glad to be in a position to report that the number of mares served under their Scheme during the eeaeon which has now closed ie estimated at 6000 as compared with 5491 served in the;previous Reason.She tabulation of the returns made on 4th June last is now completed; the Preliminary Statement is in press and will &quot;be issued shortly.    An extract showing the principal figures is appended and in connection therewith it will be observed that the provisional figures issued on 17th July are altered only slightly.    The actual figures for wheat, barley and oats are 2000, 2000 and 3000 acres respectively higher tha in the Provisional figures while potatoes are  000 acres less. The total increase in the area of land in 191$ under crops, otyaer than rotation grasses and clover as compared with 1917, is approximately 227,000 acres. ;    / ,It will be observed from the table that the total aoreago under crops and grass ia lese in 1918 by 15,575 acres compared with the year 1917.    A scrutiny of the returns has however revealed the fact that 24,912 acree formerly classifie under &quot;Crops and Grass* ae &quot;Permanent Grass&quot; are now included under the heading &quot;Mountain and Heath&quot;.    Against this 2903 acres have been transferred from &quot;Mountain and Heath&quot; to &quot;Permanent Grass&quot; and in addition ,5374 aores of &quot;Mountain and Heath&quot; are returned as. having actually been brought into cultivation.    The Preliminary Statement for England and Vales . shows a similar decrease in the total acreage under &quot;Crops and Grass&quot; with an approximately corresponding increase in the arei under &quot;Mountain and Heath&quot;,
