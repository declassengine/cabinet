SUMMARY OP ?MM ACTIVITY FOR TrC PERIOD       2%b SITING AUGUST 26TH, 1918.l,   a s t z r n    front.(a) Hovements and accommodation.   Since the 12th August the following fresh movements and alterations in accommodation on the Battle Fronts have appeared:-BATTL5 front. .kovsbhtsi CHANGES IN .

Owing to the continued counter-offensive the large group of aerodromes situated in the Perrone-Ham-Noyon Area, has now been almost entirely evacuated. Comparatively few new aerodromes have so far been located.(c) Bnemy^ Attitude.(i) Aeroplanes,Scout Activity.From the Coast t&quot; Hoiuhulst Forest,   Scout activity shewed a dfitinc.xTIncr el&amp;o^bn TKe&apos;*coasT&apos;luring the first half of the fortnight-, bat a decrease during the second half. The majority of the machines encountered were in the Bruges Area.   This is probably due to the successive raids that have been carried out on the harbour, aerodromes, dumps, etc. in that vicinity.From Lys to the Saarpe.     Scout activity has been slight.From Searpe to Albert.   Scout activity has increased considerably, especially on the 21st August and the following days, but not to the same extent as to the South of the Somme following the attack on the 8th August,From Albert to Roye.   Activity slight, considering the active operations that have been in progress.Reconnaissance Activity,Reconnaissance work has been carried out regularly extending over all Sectors, and is characterised by a desired
find out our intentions and the apprehension of a further offensive.

Summary.

Considering the operations in progress, enemy activity on the battle front cannot be described as intense, and suggests that fl?ghts may have been withdrawn to recuperate after their losses in the operations south of the Somme.

(ii) Seaplanes.

Since the attack on a flotilla of coastal motor-boats by seaplanes from Borkum and Norderney on August 11th, there has been no special activity to record on the part of enemy seaplanes in the North Sea.

A case has recently been reported of the examination of a neutral merchant vessel whilst at sea by an accupant of an enemy seaplane.

(iii) Airships.

Since August 12th, there has been little airship activity in the North Sea.

(d) Distribution of German Bombing Forces on the Western Front. (Twin ?engine and Giant Machines).

No change.

Giant Aeroplanes. There has been a slight decrease of activity as compared with the previous fortnight. The Northern Squadron (Ghent) has, as uaual, shown greater activity than the Southern Squadron (Morville).

On the nights of the 13th, 14th and 24th, the Northern Squadron is believed to have taken part in the raids on Calais and Dunkirk.

The Southern Squadron has shown very little activity, most of which has boon confined to the enemy&apos;s side of the line. This Squadron (Morville) is reported as having established a detached section at Etreux; further confirmation is required.

Bombing Activity. The forward areas between Bethune and Arras have again been heavily bombed. It is of interest to note that the bombing flights from the Ghent Area were employed against this area. Two machines of the 3rd Squadron (Ghent) have been brought down near Puchovillers-Arras. As usual the rear lines of communication have also received attention, namely :-

Dunkirk - Calais, twice.

Boulogne - Etaples, once.

(e) Losses in German Air Forces - Western Front.

Aeroplanes.

The total losses sustained by the enemy on the western Front from the beginning of January 1918 to August 25th 1918, are as follows :-

Western Front (R.A.F. with the Armies in the Field)

1979 machines destroyed.

768 out of control

Total. 2747 machines.

Reconnaissance Company from Herzegovina.One Company, duties unknown, from Vienna (recent forma^tion).One Reconnaissance Company from Galicia, believed to be on the Italian Front, but not yet   identified,A Flying School has also boen reported to be situated at Artegna (Tagliamento),(ii)   Sea Units.   Recent reports from tho Adriatic she\, the Austrian Naval Air Service continues to be in a low state of strength and efficiency, with a shortage of machines and personnel.   In some quarters there has been dissatisfaction, Which has resulted in desertions.Lossoa. A recent report states that in vieT. of the heavlosses suffered lately by the Austrian Air Service, an   effort has boon made to speed up production in the factories and that this has resulted in the   output of machines of inferior oon-struction and material.   The frequent accidents that occur during flights are attributed to this cause.(c)   RUSSIA.(i)   Finland,   In connection with the German advanoe into Finland, a nev. seaplane base has recently been reported at SORDAYALA on the northern shores of Lake Lodoga,(il)   MurmanskExpeditionary Force,(b)   PALESTINE, IGiSOPOTAMIA &amp; SALONIKA.No change.No change.
