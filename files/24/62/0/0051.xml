Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

G.T.5551

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memoranda prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 23th August, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Forty applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week.  The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£68,165.

PROGRESS OF CROPS.

Farmers were occupied during the week in the reaping and stacking of oats, barley and winter wheat, and these operations are nearing completion in southern counties. In northern areas, where grain crops ripen later, farmers vere busy completing ths harvesting of flax.  The yield of oats promises to be satisfactory, and, in general, harvest prospects are encouraging.

The potato crop promises well both as to yield and quality. Properly sprayed areas are resisting the attack of "blight", and the damage from this disease is not expected to have serious results at the present stage of growth. Weather conditions during the week were favourable for root crops, which are making rapid growtn.

Arrangements for the prosecution of an active propaganda in favour of the sowing of catch crops are being made by the Department&apos;s County Agricultural staffs. Owing to the pressure of harvesting operations at the moment, farmers find difficulty in sowing these crops as early as would be desirable.

CATTLE FEEDING STUFFS.

Under the arrangement entered into by the Department with the Ministry of Food, the shipment of feeding cakes and cake meals to Ireland commenced during the week; and it is expected that improved supplies will be available for farmers and stock feeders during the coming season.

FLAX.

Most of the flax crop has now been pulled, the work having been done under fairly favourable weather conditions. Retting and drying operations are in full swing.

4t !&quot;&apos; 1 JLeUFarmers generally are taking a greater interest in saviirc a portion of their flax for seedthan was tho case last year, though the vast majority of ton are pot rosorving more than tho ono-ei&amp;bU roquirod Under tho Flaxieod (Ireland) Order, 1513.  Some femora, hov/ovor.aro saving tho whole of tho crop for seed, and a few are rippling thoi? flax groen and securing tie holla for foeding purposes.  Owing to labour educations, this is only being done on a comparatively small scale.An effort is being made to get flax growers and mill owners to arrive at an anicable settloaont as to scutching charges for tho coming season, without calling for tho intervention of the;JGovennBnt. With this end in view the Department have arranged for conferences of representatives of both the interests concerned, to!be held at different centres throurfiout the flax growing districts. Mr. Harold Barbour has been nominated by tho Department as anIindependent person to act as Chairman at those conferences.The total number of caseB of failure to county with the  laxseed (Ireland) Order, 1916, reported to tho Departont, is now63 -During the poriod from 20th to 26th instant, inclusive, 135 applications for licences to slaughter or exgort heifers arid 30 applications for licences to export store heifers wore received, Ninety-six applications for licences to slaugitor bulls or bollocks and 20 applications for licences to slaughter or export young&apos; female lambs, wore also received.
