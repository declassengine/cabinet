[Tins Document is the Property .of His Britannic Majestys Government.] Printed for the War Cabinet.  August 1918.SECRET.G.T.-5532. ;    4 Q[        jusIMPERIAL  WAR CABINET.27/Gen. No/6941. -BRITISH MAN-POWER.Notes by the Secretary of State for War on Lieutenant-Colonel Roure&apos;s Report(G.T.-5277).THE report which Colonel Roure has presented to the Prime Minister as the result of his investigations into our military and recruiting effort is one which it is impossible either for myself, as Secretary of State for War, or for the Minister of National Service, to allow to pass unchallenged. The Army Council and the Ministry of National Service welcomed Colonel Roure&apos;s assistance, and are, I am certain, only too anxious to avail themselves of any suggestion which would improve the combatant efficiency of the army, or secure a higher intake of recruits. But I am constrained to point out that the main conclusions of the report as to the relative effort of the United Kingdom and of France are very misleading, and can only have a prejudicial effect upon the relations of the two countries if they are accepted in France as in any sense a correct interpretation of the facts. I am sure there was no lack, on Colonel Roure&apos;s part, of a sincere desire to investigate the problem with complete impartiality. But it would be difficult for any Frenchman, most of all for a French soldier steeped in the military system of his own country, to take sufficiently into account the profound difference in the national organisation of the two countries, and . in the functions which they have respectively fulfilled in the present war. This task, indeed, has not been attempted by Colonel Roure. Starting with the assumption that the only test of national effort in the war is the numerical combatant strength maintained at the front, he has had no difficulty in showing, from the statistics placed at his disposal, that our national effort, in this particular respect, has been less than that of France. This may be readily admitted. What is inadmissible is the conclusion which he proceeds to draw from these statistics, namely, that there is still a &quot;degree of reserve&quot; in our national effort, that &quot;the British nation does not yet look upon the war as a great national task involving vital consequences,&quot; and that we have, in fact, large available reserves both with the colours and still in civil life which would enable us to complete and maintain indefinitely our present total of divisions in the field, if only we took the war sufficiently seriously.The British National Effort.The first and most important contention advanced by Colonel Roure is based on a purely statistical comparison of the distribution of the male population of fighting age in the two countries between military and non-military employments. This comparison shows that out of 1,000 men between the ages of 20 and 43* there are: ---	In Great Britain.	In France.Serving in the Army, Navy, Air Service, or in	327	527the colonies		In home services	175	175Discharged after service  ..	100	90Kngaged in non-military employments	31)8	208*&apos; The figures for Great Britain, as a matter of fact, are those fur men between the Ages of 18 and 42. If the French figures included the two earlier years, the proportion of men engaged on non-military employments would be higher, as few, if any, Frenchmen under 19 have leen called up for service. In this connection it should also be noted that Table Via of Colonel Ronre&apos;8 report, which shows the fighting strength of the French contingent, includes some 1,350,000 men who, in the corresponding table supplied by the Ministry of National Serrice, have been shown in Class B Reserve, and not in the fighting contingent,[747] B
That these figures cannot be applied absolutely without qualification is realised in the report, and Colonel Roure suggests that, in view of the,services which the United Kingdom renders to the Allies in respect of shipping, coal, and other supplier, 1,000,000 men of military age should be regarded as set aside in our case. His table, after this arbitrary deduction, works out as follows: Groat Britain, (deducting&quot; 1,000,000 workmen.)Serving in   the Army,  Navy,  Air  Force,	572	702colonies, or in home services		-Discharged from service   ..	118	90Engaged in non-military employments	315	208These figures, in Colonel Rou!re&apos;s opinion, &quot; speak for themselves,&quot; and lead &quot; to the inevitable conclusion that the United Kingdom has still something to fulfil before her effort can be compared with that of Trance, whether from the point of view of the total sacrifices made for the common cause or from that of the utilisation of: man-power in view of essential military aims.&quot;But the figures do not &quot; speak for themselves,&quot; at any rate not unless they aire considered in the light of certain dominating factors which were evidently not present in Colonel Roure&apos;s mind when he framed his conclusions. Of these factors, the first and most important is the character and extent of the naval and maritime effort of the United Kingdom. That effort is the foundation of. the whole military framework of the Alliance. Without it there could have been no British or American troops in Trance. Without it Russia could not have received the munitions and supplies which enabled her to stay in the war as long as she did. Without it Italy coald never have dreamt of entering the war. Without it there could have been no Allied force at Salonika, or, indeed, anywhere outside the continental territories of France and Russia. Without it Germany would have been nnblockaded, and free to send her expeditionary forces to threaten the Allied armies in rear, or to capture Allied territories oversea. It is, in fact, the one indispensable factor. The Alliance can survive the loss of even the greatest armies, as the defec-tion of Russia has shown, and gather fresh strength for a renewed effort. The less of the command of the sea by the United Kingdom would be the end of the Alliance, and mark the definite victory of Germany. In the words of the Prime Minister: &quot;Unless the Allies had been completely triumphant at the outset of the war at sea, no efforts on land would have saved them. The British fleet is mainly responsible foe that complete triumph. It could not have been secured and maintained without gigantic efforts in men and material: Any redistribution of our resources which would impair in the least its efforts would be ruinous to the cause of the Allies.&quot; .In the interest then of the Allies, as well as of ourselves, the maintenance of the British navy and mercantile marine must be the first charge upon the resources of this country. A few figures are sufficient to show the extent of that, charge. The total tonnage of the navy, including auxiliary vessels, has been raised in. the course of the war, in spite of heavy losses through submarines, from %\ million to 6 million tons (5,360 vessels, including 1,250 warships). In the first five months of the present year, 203 warships and auxiliary vessels were completed in Great Britain. This immense increase in construction has necessarily involved a large increase of personnel. In one passage of his report, Colonel Roure suggests that the recent enrolment of 32,000 men in the navy for its many new services ought to have teen obviated by abolishing older services, and that it is only &quot; by oversight that such organisations are still maintained.&quot; Exactly what part of the British navy is only maintained by an oversight, and should be abolished, is not explained, but a refer-ence by Colonel Roure to any one in his&apos; own Admiralty would have at once shown him the fallacy underlying his suggestion. What he has entirely ignored, in fact, is that the British navy has been engaged during the last two and a-half years in a ceaseless conflict on) an ever-increasing scale against the German submarine offensive. That offensive, which reached its most critical stage during 1917, was aimed at the destruction! of the whole Alliance. But for the tremendous effort of the British navy that aim would certainly have been accomplished, and, even to-day, any relaxation of that effort would bring the whole fabric of the Alliance crashing to the ground.
Our mercantile marine, which at the outbreak of the war stood at 18^ million tons, has, in spite of losses amounting in all to 7,400,000 tons, been maintained at over 15 million tons, the total new construction in the first six months of 1918 amounting to 763,000 gross tons. The work of repairing the navy and mercantile marine is in itself a gigantic task, in the first six months of the year, 0,014 British warships and auxiliary vessels, 106 Allied warships and auxiliary vessels, and 13 million tons of merchant shipping, of which some 11-1 million tons were British, were repaired and refitted in British yards. Apart from the actual personnel of the navy itself, amounting to nearly 400,000 men, the number of men employed in. the construction, equipment, and repairing of the-navy amounts to nearly 500,000. The personnel absorbed in the construction, repairing, and manning of the merchant service (including the continually increasing repairs to Allied and neutral merchant vessels) amounts approximately to another 400,000. But this figure covers only a portion of the man-power effort which is involved in the maintenance of the mercantile marine. There are the various branches of the steamship services on shore, the large army of lightermen, dock labourers, &amp;o, whose adequacy in point of numbers and whose efficiency are essential to securing that the maximum result should be secured from our shipping, that it should, in fact, as far as possible be actually transporting men or goods at sea, and not losing time in port. How essential, indeed, these services are is shown by the fact that the^Government has found itself compelled to supplement the existing labour supply at the docks by some 15,000 men organised in dockers&apos; battalions. There is further all the personnel of the industries concerned in furnishing the particular supplies required for the effective main-tenance and operation of a steamship.Taking into account the minimum requirements of industry for the supply and maintenance of the mercantile fleet and the personnel of the mercantile marine, it is found that these essential services absorb upwards of 1,130,000 men, of whom approximately 580,000 are between the ages of 18 and 48. If we add to these 560,000 the 495,000 coal miners within the same ages we get 1,055,000 men of the former military age in coal mining, shipbuilding, and shipping alone, or more than the total which Colonel Eoure is prepared to set aside for the whole of our industries.Our concentration on the effort at sea is, however, only a part of the whole difference in national structure and circumstances which has inevitably caused us to play a more many-sided part in this war than any other Power, and. which makes valueless any simple statistical comparison of purely military effort with a country like France. It must be remembered that France, at the outbreak of this war, was almost ideally organised from the national point of view for the raising of a large army relatively to her total population. Half her population was engaged, in agricui-ture, and that agriculture was based, on a system of small holdings where, even in peace, the working unit is the family as a whole, and where, in war, the remaining members of the family can, by an extra effort, largely make up for the labour of the member or members who have gone to the front. Again, France had a relatively low population of those industries which necessarily absorb a large volume of adult male labour, even in time of war, e.g. shipping, shipbuilding, mining, and the heavy iron and steel industries. Lastly France had not.only had universal military service in force since 1870, but had carried it out in a far more drastic form that any other-nation in Europe. For a whole generation her effort had been to organise, out of her much smaller population, an army which should be capable of holding its own against the German army, and in no other nation, not even the German, was the principle of universal service so deeply ingrained in every section of the people.Great Britain, on the other hand, was organised on an entirely different basis. Only one-tenth of its population was engaged in agriculture. That agriculture, more-over, was based on the unit, not of the co-operative family, but of the skilled farm labourer working on a relatively large farm, and doing work with respect to which it has not been easy to find substitutes at short notice, though great efforts have been made to organise the employment both of female labour and of labour-saving machinery. Moreover, while France has only had to endeavour to keep up her agricultural production as far as possible during the war, we have been compelled by the submarine campaign, in order to liberate shipping for the essential military needs of ourselves and our allies, to make a great effort to increase our agricultural&apos;pro-duction. It is significant of the difficulties of our problem that our effort in this respect has had to be-seriously curtailed this year for the sake of finding troops for the army. Again, with us the heavy industries, coal, iron, steel, shipbuilding, which
have since performed so vital a function in the supply of Allied needs, have played a much larger part in, the national organisation and absorbed a far greater propor-tion of our population than has been the case in France.In all these respects our national organisation has undoubtedly been less well adapted to the purpose of yielding a high quota of recruits for the army. But it is essential to remember that we have been better organised for fulfilling certain other functions, without which this war could not have been sustained for many months. The value to the Alliance of our national organisation has not been limited to our navy and mercantile marine. While the war in its first few months was mainly one of mobilised and trained man-power in the field, with such equipment as each side had provided before the war, the war has since, in an ever-increasing degree, been a war of material and mechanism. France was not organised for that type of war, and could not have sustained it as she has done if her effort had not been supple-mented1 by this country. From the point of view of military effort it is impossible to dissociate the total number of Frenchmen in the combatant services from the Englishmen who supply France with iron, steel, and coal, as well as with the shipping required for innumerable other necessities of existence. To arrive at any fair com-parison of the national effort of the two countries, and of the part played by actual military service in that national effort, one ought, on the one hand, to subtract from our total population that part of it which is engaged in furnishing assistance of one sort or other to our Allies, and, on the other, to add to the French population a quota corresponding to the man-power thus borrowed by France from us to supple-ment her own resources.A single instance will suffice to illustrate the argument. When the German advance a few months ago put certain French coal-mines out of action, the miners were promptly mobilised, and the French ratio of mobilised men to men engaged in civil occupations correspondingly increased. But France could not do without the coal, which has now to be furnished by an extra effort on our part, involving the work of over 20,000 miners, and reducing correspondingly the ratio of military to non-military effort in this country. The same process of substitution has been at work on a far larger scale, not only as regards the great industrial areas of North-Eastern France, which fell into German hands at the outset of the war, but as regards all those steadily increasing needs of France, both for the maintenance of her army and of her civil population, which have been to so large an extent supplied by British effort.To give an exact quantitative estimate of the extent to which our man-power has had1 to be retained in industries essential, not only to the maintenance of our own navy and army, but also to the maintenance of our allies, would not be an easy task. Certain items can be assessed without great difficulty. The 28,000,000 tons of coal we export to France, for instance, represent the labour of some 117,000 miners. We have got a million tons of British shipping at French disposal, and another 250,000 tons of shipping are absorbed in services rendered to France by other vessels which remain under British control. But a broad general indication of the assistance furnished by Great Britain to the Alliance as a whole is given by the figures of our advances, which, though reckoned in money, have, in fact, throughout been rendered in the shape of services, direct or indirect. The total advanced to our Allies and to the British Dominions, to enable them to maintain their troops in the field during four years of war, amounts to over 1,600,000,000^., the equivalent, on the basis given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his speech on the recent Vote of Credit, to 4,000,000 labour units a year. Of this amount, 402,000,000^., or the equivalent of 1,000,000 labour units a year, have been advanced to France. It is not necessary to attempt to justify the precise accuracy of the basis of this calculation, or to analyse the various services in order to ascertain the exact proportion of men of military age who have necessarily been included in the labour units thus put at the disposal of our Allies. The broad fact remains that we have advanced to our Allies, and more particularly to France, an enormous volume of man-power which has increased1 the proportion of soldiers they have been able to put into the fighting line, and corre-spondingly diminished the proportion of our own combatant services to our total population.In other words, the development of our national organisation in the course of the war has been such as to make possible the very highest combatant efficiency on the part of our Allies in general, and of France in particular, though&apos;that very fact has put a limit upon the &quot;proportion of our total manhood maintained at the front. This ha3
not been due to any unwillingness on our part to face the sacrifice of life in the field. To state,as Colonel Roure does, that our system of recruiting shows the preponderating influence of industrial and economic interests, and bears no trace of the Trench conception of equality of sacrifice, is to beg the whole question at issue. The question is, and has been throughout, one of doing that which would contribute most to the victory of the Allies, thereby reducing the sacrifice for each and all, and ensuring that each and all should reap the fruits of their sacrifices. To have concentrated our whole effort upon achieving an equality of sacrifice with France in respect of the number of men put in the field, regardless of the needs of our Allies, would, under the actual conditions of the present war, have been no service to the Allied cause or to France herself.It is upon the clear recognition of these facts that our recruiting organisation was undertaken and completed on a scientific occupational basis. At the time when the registration organisation of this country was undertaken, it had become clear that enormous industrial demands would be made upon it, and that it was therefore essential so to organise our man-power as to hold the balance between military and industrial requirements, and to afford the Allied cause the most valuable aggregate effort. No other system of organisation would have been equally effective. The present system enables the &quot;Government at any time to review the man-power position, to ascertain the numbers of men and women engaged in essential industries which contribute directly to the war effort of the Allies, and to see the effect on any particular class of output of the withdrawal of a given number of men.That we are not reluctant to face the sacrifices involved in military service is shown by the fact that we not only call our recruits to the colours earlier than the French, but that during the recent crisis we have largely filled up our divisions at the front with boys of 18^. This policy has been adopted, not because it is desirable in itself, but because it is preferable to the alternative, namely, the dislocation of essential industries upon which the Allied cause depends.It is no use telling us that we have hundreds of thousands of men still available if we were only willing to take them. We have already made the most determined attempt to increase our military strength, in order to meet the critical situation which arose last March, and the result of our efforts is the best disproof of Colonel Roure&apos;s contention. The measures we have taken measures which in Colonel Roure&apos;s opinion are obviously inadequate have had the most serious effect, not only upon the further development of the policy of economising shipping by increased agricultural production, but also upon our output of munitions. The importance of the Allied superiority in tanks and aeroplanes has been strikingly emphasised in the fighting of the last few weeks. It may well become the determining factor of the whole war in 1919. But in respect of both of these instruments of modern war-fare, the recent comb-out of munition industries has had a most serious effect upon output. Even in respect of textiles the attempt to comb out further men for the army at a moment when the Allied demand for uniforms is continually increasing is creating a most difficult situation.In the case of coal, our Allies collectively, and France in particular, are putting ever-increasing pressure upon the British Government to increase our production and export. It is only in the last few days (August 17th) that a most weighty memorial as to ic the extremely grave consequences &apos;&apos; to the Allied cause of the present shortage in the output of coal in the United Kingdom has been presented to the British Government by the American, French, and Italian delegates to the Allied Maritime Transport &quot;Council. This document, which bears the signatures of MM. Loucheur and Clementel, states that in no Allied supply service &quot; is the risk of disaster so great, and the possible consequences of disaster so serious, as in the case of coal.&quot; It draws attention to the grave existing deficit, to the serious waste of shipping already resulting from it, to the probability of grave coal crises in, France and Italy with serious effects on military transport, to the serious indirect effect upon the steel output of the Allies and upon the transport of American, troops, and concludes by insisting that the only effective solution to an &quot; exceedingly serious situation &quot; lies in &quot; the increase of production of coal in the United Kingdom.&quot; We have determined, in order to be able to meet the demands of cur Allies, to enforce the most stringent economy in our own industrial and domestic consumption, even at the cost of considerable hardship to our people during the coming winter. Even so, wTe have found ourselves compelled to bring back to the mines some of the 75,000 men whom we had decided to call up last spring. There is, thus, obviously no room for[747] &apos; &apos;      C
finding additional men for our army in this, by far the largest reservoir of men of military age still left in the country.Moreover, continually increasing demands are being made upon this country in every direction in connection both with the progressive development of the mechanical factor in warfare and with the needs of the American army in France, which depends on us to an enormous extent, not only for its actual transportation across the Atlantic, but for its equipment in almost every respect. Eequisitions have been put in for an additional 10,000 railway waggons, and even this figure may not prove sufficient, as is indicated by the following extracts from a resolution passed by the Allied Food Controllers on the 26th July:-&quot; The quantity of railway material now taken up for military purposes in each of the Allied countries is so great and is so constantly on the&apos; increase that the number of locomotives and trucks left for the carriage of civilian supplies has gradually sunk to such a dangerous level that economic life is actually threatened with paralysis in some quarters. This would be bound in the long rim to paralyse military operations,&quot;The Food Council therefore calls the attention of the Allied Govern-ments to the necessity of: &quot;1. Facilitating the construction of railway material in all Allied countries by allocating a greater number of men and a larger quantity of material for this purpose;&quot;2. Allocating tonnage for the immediate transport of trucks and loco-motives in all countries where they are urgently needed;&quot;3. The adequate provision of finance for the purpose.&quot;The general situation is clearly summarised in the following quotation from the report of the Permanent Labour Sub-Committee of the War Priorities Com-mittee, and from the Resolution of the Committee of Ministers confirming the report and submitting it to the War Cabinet: &quot;At the outset of their deliberations the Sub-Committee felt that they were bound by the policy of the Government to safeguard the development of shipbuilding. With regard to munitions the Sub-Committee were inevitably faced with the position that the extent to which special treatment should be accorded to pivotal men in the munitions industries must depend upon the relative importance of men and munitions. In the course of their deliberations the War Office representative reported that both the Army Council and the Supreme War Council considered it essential not only to main-tain so far as possible the normal output of munitions, but also to accelerate and increase the output of certain special munitions, such as tanks, gun equip-ment, and gas. The Sub-Committee has, therefore, assumed that it is their duty to-make recommendations which will not only safeguard the shipbuilding programme, but will also enable the Ministry of Munitions to fulfil the require-ments of the military authorities.&quot;* * * * &apos; *&quot; The War Priorities Committee, sitting as a Committee of Ministers, having considered the report of the Labour iSub-Committee on the release of men born in the years 1895, 1896, and 1897, are of opinion that it is imprac-ticable, consistently with the maintenance of the essential output of munitions of Avar manufactured on the present scale of our own forces and those of our Allies, to make any clean cut applicable to the men of these ages, or to lay down any principle upon which any modification of such a clean cut could be made operative. They therefore approve the report and instruct the Depart-ments to proceed upon the lines therein indicated. They at the same time desire to record their opinion that no clean cut in these or any older ages is practicable, and that no further substantial number of men of these and older ages can be released en bloc from essential industries, except in the ordinary course of-release by departments, without seriouslv effecting the output of key industries. They accordingly submit that if the War Cabinet decide that any Inrther substantial releases are necessary other than in the ordinary course of release by departments, the War Cabinet should state in what respect pro-eranmWof production are to be curtailed, as it is not possible to fulfil the. present programme of production and at the same time release men on a large scale for the Army.
&apos;&apos; The War Priorities Committee records further its view, that the time has now arrived when the War Cabinet must review as a whole the national war effort as affecting man-power and munition programmes and including industrial and munitions assistance to&quot;our Allies. Further, the Committee recommend that no new or extended programmes involving labour in buildings or produc-tion should be authorised by the War Cabinet without a clear indication of a corresponding reduction elsewhere, as there is no longer sufficient man-power to go round for all requirements.&quot;Nor is it possible to ignore the historical differences in the circumstances of the two countries, in France conscription has been based throughout on a principle which is deeply ingrained in the wnole nation. With us conscription was unknown betore tne war, and was not enforced until the war had been in progress for nearly two years. To create in a few months a recruiting organisation which should work as simply and smoothly, and be as universally understood, as one which has been in force for over forty years, was obviously impossible. The need for explanation, for discussion with the representatives of industry and labour, for investigation of individual cases before democratic tribunals, was inevitable. To have ridden rough-shod over these difficulties, regardless of the history and actual circumstances of our country and of the character of its people, would neither have expedited matters nor increased the total of recruits ultimatelv available. The British Government is not afraid to ask the utmost efforts and sacrifices from the British people. But it must take national conditions and characteristics into account, and must itself be the judge of the methods which are calculated to yield the best result.To admit this difference in national conditions is, however, very far from admitting the general charge which Colonel Roure has made that the &quot; labouring class is taking no interest in the war.&quot; It is doubtful whether Colonel Roure can have made any careful detailed investigation to support this indictment. The only instance he quotes, namely, the slight success of the appeal to the workers to sacrifice their Easter holiday at the time of the recent German offensive, leads to a verv different conclusion. The response to that appeal was, in fact, an addition of working hours which not only compensated for the whole of the time lost in strikes during the preceding year, but left the Ministry of Munitions with 1,000,000 working days in credit. That there have been labour difficulties, that the men have not always, in the first instance at any rate, taken a reasonable attitude, that in some cases even now the effort is below the standard of what can and ought to be achieved, is no doubt true in this countrv as, indeed, also in other countries. But the mere facts as to the volume of British output in every department of industry during the war, in spite of the withdrawal of an immense body of the most capable workers for military -service, are sufficient disproof of any general indictment&apos; against the British working class.Proportion of Troops Retained for Home Defence.The second criticism which Colonel Roure brings against our military arrange-ments is that we retain an excessively large military establishment at home&apos;compared with that which we maintain at the front. This is a criticism which is so frequently made, and often in such an extravagant form, that it is necessary to answer it in some detail. In the portion of his report which deals with the &quot;Utilisation of Mobilised Forces,&quot; Colonel Roure contends that the 141,000 men retained for the defence of the United Kingdom are altogether excessive for the purpose, in view of the unquestioned superiority of the British navy, and suggests that the entire mobile force (exclusive of troops required for Ireland) should be sent to France. Leaving aside for the moment the fact that this force, in so far as it contains men fit for combatant service abroad, is mainly a training ground through which young recruits are passed, it is very evident that Colonel Roure has not sufficiently appre-ciated the fact that the unquestioned superiority of the British navy is no guarantee against raids. Given the length of coast exposed to such raids it is obvious that the defence has to be distributed over a very wide area, and that even the most elementary defensive measures must absorb a not inconsiderable number of men. Nor has Colonel Roure made any allowance for the fact that while the anti-aircraft defence of France is to a very large extent provided by the French and British armies on the French front, the anti-aircraft defence of the centres of industry and
military and naval construction in Great Britain has had to be organised on an entirely independent scale, and that only the success with which it has been organised has prevented the most serious consequences to the whole Allied cause. Of the Allied Powers the only one confronted with the same problem of defence against raids by sea and air is Italy. In her case the problem is simplified by the actual territorial continuity between &apos;the main military front and the coastal region open to possible invasion. Even so Italy maintains for local defence a force of 180,000 men (including 50,000 Carabinieri) as against 141,000 maintained in the United Kingdom.But what is really in essence the same problem is that which France has to deal with in Algeria and Morocco. Here there is no, question of serious invasion, but partly, as in Ireland, of maintaining order, partly as in Great Britain of watching a very long frontier in order to check raids which, though not very formidable in themselves, might have serious consequences if neglected. We find, consequently, that France maintains in this portion of what is from many points of view really part of her home territory,* a force which, according to Colonel Roure&apos;s note of the 13th June to Lord Milner (p. 26 of the report), includes 120,000 Frenchmen, and which, from a comparison of Tables Ia and VIa of the Report, would include not far from double that figure,! quite apart from native troops maintained in the same region. In the statistical comparisons which Colonel Roure has given in Appendix II of his report (pp. 13 and 14) he treats these as part of the forces maintained at the front by France. On this basis he proves that while the men immobilised in military employment at home, including home defence (but not, of course, including recruits in training or convalescents) are in the case of France equivalent to only 1.2.5 per cent, of the force maintained at the front, the proportion in our case was on the 1st March 24 per cent., or nearly twice as high. I would suggest that the com-parison would be much fairer if North Africa were treated as part of the home territorv, as far, at least, as French troops are concerned. In that case the French oroDortion of men on home service of all kinds to men on active service would be 21.5 per cent, or practically identical with the British proportion since last May (Table II). Or taking home defence separately from other home service, the figures (taking the British figures for May) would work out as follows : 	France.	Great Britain.	Per cent.	Per cent.Home defence	7	6-5Other home ser-ices	14-5	15-5Total    ..	21-5	22As a matter of fact, however, I would submit that statistical comparisons of this sort have little value in view of the totally different conditions of the two countries, and that the only really useful test is that of the actual adequacy or excess of the establishments maintained at home to the need of our home defence or of our total military organisation. From this point of view every effort has been made and will continue to be made, as far as we are concerned, to cut them down to the lowest figure compatible with security and efficiency.A further factor which should not be left out of sight in this connection, but which Colonel Roure has throughout ignored, is the fundamental difference in organisation between an army fighting in its own country and an expediticnary force which has to be maintained, oversea. In the former case the mobilising, train-ing, and despatch to the front of the men, and the securing, concentrating, and distributing of supplies, are in effect all parts of a single process which takes place by the shortest route from the depot to the nearest point of the front, and requires the minimum of administrative machinery. In the latter case the intervening stage of despatch oversea introduces an element of complication which is necessarilv reflected in the administrative and supply personnel both at home and&apos;, as I shall have to point out in another connection, in the corresponding personnel oversea.* The white troops raised by conscription in North Africa are, in fact, included in some, at least, of Colonel Roure&apos;s tables as part of the French effort in man-power.t The difference is presumably between combatant strength and total strength including depots, administrative personnel, and services of the Interior.
One aspect of this difference is reflected in the ease with which leave can be given in a home defence army, and what is no less important, both from the indivi-dual and from the national point of view, adapted to the needs of the soldier&apos;s business or industry. That leave is much more freely given in the French army than in the British forces in France, and obviously still more so than in the British forces in more outlying theatres, is a fact which would not be disputed.   But it is not taken into account in Colonel Roure&apos;s calculations, though a difference of only one per cent, in the frequency or duration of leave involves a reduction of the nominal strength of the French Army at the front by&quot; an additional 30,000 men, and an equivalent increase of the population engaged in rest or in non-military occupations in rear. The difference, however, is not merely statistical but affects fundamentally the whole problem of recruitment and exemption.   Practically the whole French army is, apart from the actual perils of the battle zone, in the position of that small fraction of British Territorials who, in the first two years of the war, confined themselves to fulfilling their obligation to serve at&apos;home, because they wished to be able to remain in touch with their private affairs.   There can be no doubt that the whole principle of our recruiting system and the standards of our tribunals might have been more drastic in their dealings both with industries and with individuals, if military service had still only meant home&apos; service, with all the moral and material compensations implied in the term, and not service oversea.Proportion of Non-Combatants to Combatants at the Front.This essential difference between an expeditionary force and a home defence army is similarly overlooked by Colonel Roure in his criticism of the high proportion of non-combatants and rearward services in the British army in France as compared with the French army. The French army at the front is based directly upon the interior; a very considerable portion of the work done for it, e.g., as regards rail-way transportation, is performed by civilian personnel. Goods imported for its use from overseas are handled at the ports by civilian labour. The British Expedi-tionary Force in France is based ultimately.on Great Britain. But it has to have an entire new series of bases in France. For reasons of discipline, the whole personnel required in connection with these bases, for the off-loading at the ports, and for. staffing the sections of the French railways which we run, have to be under military law,&apos; and figure in the non-combatant establishment of the force. Where France can, as she did at the beginning of the present year, bring up in an emergency 200,000 civilians from the interior for a few weeks to dig trenches, we are compelled to rely on a permanent military labour corps. These facts in themselves might easily account for the whole difference between the 36 per cent, of non-combatants which, according to Colonel Roure, are maintained in the British force on the French front as contrasted with the 27 per cent, of non-combatants in the French force.As a matter of fact, however, quite apart from this fundamental difference, Colonel Roure&apos;s figures require considerable revision.  The table on which he bases his figure for British troops is one which excludes the Dominion troops.   This is quite correct when the question at issue is one of the effort of the United Kingdom. But it is apt to mislead when the question is one of organisation.   The British rearward services are organised for the whole army, and include a proportion of men who are working for the Dominion troops.   Taking the whole of the British forces, home and overseas, on the French front, the percentage of non-combatants is not 36 but 32.7.  Again his figures for the French troops (Table III a) include among the combatants 100,471 men in the &quot; Centres Divisionnaires &quot; and 105.218 Territorial infantry.  But the former are men not yet in the fighting line, but rein-forcements, and the latter though nominally combatants, and used as such in auieter sections of the line, are also largely used for the same purposes as our labour battalions.   On the other hand his figures do not include some 45,000 Italian labourers lent by the Italian military authorities to the.French army: still less do t.heTT include the 200,000 emergency, civilian labourers already referred to.  But if. the &quot;Centre Divisionnaires &quot; are excluded, the Territorials reckoned as half ccm-batauts and half non-combatants, and allowance made for the Italians, the French proportion of non-combatants rises to 32.6 per cent., as against 32.7 per cent, of British force.  When the fundamental difference between the conditions of fhe two forces is kept in mind it is at least open to argument whether the superior[747] D
efficiency of organisation is not on the side of the British army, in so far as a high proportion of combatants to non-combatants constitutes the standard of comparison.Lavishness in Organisation.A more general charge against the British military organisation is its lavish-ness, due, in Colonel Roure&apos;s opinion, to the fact that these services have been created de now and developed regardless of economy in man-power, to the &quot; inve-terate habits of the British people,&quot; and to the prejudices of commanding officers, influenced by the tradition that a soldier must be a sportsman, against accepting men of inferior physique in their units. Our methods in fact are too &quot; eclectic &quot;; we reject all but the very best physically, and even these we dissipate in extravagant non-combatant establishments.^ Here again it is impossible to set the same standard for an expeditionary force as for a home defence army. An expeditionary force in a strange country necessarily has to be more self-contained, and cannot rely to the same extent on the assistance of the population. Our regimental transport, for instance, cannot so easily be supplemented, as the French transport frequently is, by local borrowing of civilian transport, and therefore has to be maintained on a higher establishment. The whole process of billeting troops among a population whose language they cannot understand, of seeing that they find their way, and that they maintain an exemplary standard of behaviour, requires a far more elaborate paraphernalia of staff and military police than are needed at home. The physical standard, too, is naturally higher where every case of sickness adds to the organisations which have to be maintained in rear of the line in a foreign country, or to the congestion of the cross-Channel shipping. Moreover, in the particular circumstances of the present war, the British force in France has throughout held the sector which both from the fighting and from the climatic point of view has imposed the severest strain upon the troops. We need only imagine the positions reversed, and a French expeditionary force in Southern England holding the most active combatant sector of the line, to realise that the difference in organisation would be reversed too. The French military authorities would naturally and rightly set a high physical standard for their com-batant troops, and they would naturally give those troops a complete and even lavish organisation. We, on our side, would put into the field every man we could, allotting the second-class troops as far as possible to the quiet sectors, and carry cn with a much simpler organisation.I am not prepared to deny that there may be some truth in the charge that our methods tend to err on the side of &quot; eclecticism&quot; and lavishness of organisation. But it is equally dangerous to err in the opposite direction.^ Our phvsical standard for oversea service may appear unnecessarily high, compared with the French standard, if the only test of results is the gross total of men sent up to the front at one time or other. But if the test is the net total performing efficient military service at any given moment the more &quot;eclectic&quot; policy mav possibly prove the sounder. The proportion of sick to wounded men under treatment in the French nrnv is as 60 to 40. In the British armv it is as 47 to 53. If one considers the totals involved, and remembers that for every thousand men actually sick enough for treat-ms^t there is a much larger penumbra of men not realty well if not actually sick^-jrio&apos;. one may hestitate with good reason before being persuaded that a, lowering ^f the pV--joni standard of our combatant troops would really add to our effective fightmg strength.As a matter of fact our &quot; eclecticism &quot; does not go nearly a* far as Cokmel j?r-rp seems to think. The inference he would appear to have drawn from the taWo&apos;&quot; given in Appendix V (p. 16) of his report is that we only make use of Class A me71 ^or combatant services, and that&apos; we in fact onlv employ 63 pe^ cent, of onr jpnKjioed men for combatant service and employ 37 per cent, on auxiliary services, Avhe&quot;eas France emplovs 86 per cent, in active service and 14 per cent, in auxiliary ^vice. A verw considerable number of B 1 men were, however, emplnved in com-ba*an.t services, though not, perhaps, to any extent in the infantry in France, even* A similar charge of lavishness is brought by Colonel Roure against our Air Organisation, which lie contends has an establishment of 214.000 men for fewer machines than are looked after by 100,000 men in the French Air Service. Apart, from the fact that the figures given are not really comparable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the real test is not the proportion of men to machines in existence, but to machine-hours actualty flown and results obtained, with regard to both of which points our Air Service are convinced of the superior economy of their methods. The matter is, however, being dealt with in a separate paper by the Air Ministry.
before March last, and the proportion has since been steadily increased. Even the formation of complete divisions mainly composed of men of the lower category has now been resorted to, though it is still too early to say that the experiment is one that will prove altogether successful. I need hardly add that there is no justification for the statement quoted by Colonel Roure that in France &quot; every man is supposed to be fit for active service unless he proves the contrary. In England the supposition is reversed.&quot; The question of fitness is purely one of fact. Medical Boards start with no preconceived ideas as regards any particular man. Each man receives a thorough and unprejudiced examination, and is graded accordingly.It must be remembered, too, in this connection that the national standard of physical fitness in our case has been largely affected both by the very high pro-portion of industrial to agricultural population, and by the high rate of emigration during the last twenty years which has steadily drained away the strongest and most energetic of our younger men. A very large proportion of these are, as a matter of fact, included in the troops furnished by the Britisli Dominions, a point which, again, illustrates the difficulty of the method of crude statistical comparisons upon which Colonel Roure&apos;s paper is based.Colonel Roure&apos;&apos;s Recommendations.It has been necessary to deal at this length with Colonel Roure&apos;s criticisms of our military organisation and with the general misconception of the British war effect upon which they are based, because it is entirely upon them that his positive recommendations are founded. They are in fact not so much recommendations based on actual investigations of facts, as logical deductions from certain general statis-tical comparisons. And if it is clear that these statistical comparisons deal with matters which, owing to differences in organisation and national conditions, are not really comparable, then the deductions obviously fall to. the ground. This is most evident in the case of his main conclusion, which is that if France had the man-power resources still available in the United Kingdom she would know how to find imme-diately 200,000 800,000 combatants from among the mobilised men, and how to recruit from the civilian population enough soldiers to replace losses in future. This conclusion is based entirely on certain assumptions as to the excessiye proportions of non-combatants in our Army abroad and at home, and as to the existence of a large surplus of men engaged in non-military civil employments who could be mobilised if we took the war more seriously. Those assumptions have been examined and shown to be unwarranted, and the conclusion itself has, in any case, been disproved by our actual experience in connection with the exceptional recruiting effort of the last few months,How little Colonel Roure&apos;s conclusion is based on investigation of the actual facts is shown by an incidental statement that, while something had been done towards reclassifying men at home, there was no evidence that any effort had been made to comb fit men from non-combatant units in France for transfer to combatant units. As a matter of fact, efforts in that direction have been continuously made on a very considerable scale during the last eighteen months, not only at home, but in all theatres of war. During that time approximately 90,000 men have been combed out of the Army Service Corps alone for infantry and machine-gun service, &quot; B &quot; men have been everywhere substituted for &quot;A&quot; men wherever possible in non-combatant units, and even in certain duties with artillery and machine-gun corps. All labour and other units composed of lower category men in France are inspected once a month with a view to combing out any men who, though previously classified &quot;B,&quot; might have since become fit for service in the front line. This overhauling of the rearward services will be continued with the utmost vigour. But it is necessary to point out that it has gone very far already, and that it cannot be relied on to furnish an addition to our combatant forces even remotely approaching Colonel Roure&apos;s estimate.In this connection, Colonel Roure suggests the acceptance in the British army of the French method of three fixed age limits, below which no man may be employed (1) outside the combatant services; (2) outside the front line services; (3) outside the military zone. A rigid application of this method would be quite impossible in the case of the technical units in the army and Air Force. Quite apart from the fact that large numbers of men were originally taken for these units on a definite under-istanding that they were only to be employed in this specific capacity, there is the
practical difficulty that they could only be sent to the combatant services if replaced by large levies of less fit but equally skilled men from essential industries which cannot possibly spare them. The real problem with us, in fact, is not how to comb out young fit men in the technical services into the fighting arms, but how to avoid the necessity of having to comb them back from the army into those industries where they are most urgently needed for the maintenance of our war effort.Again, the second part of his main conclusion, namely, that the recruiting estimates seem sufficient to maintain indefinitely the present strength of our military forces once they have been reconstituted, is evidently based on a considerable mis-understanding of the figures actually supplied by the Ministry of National Service. It would appear from the references on pages 15, 18, and 20 of the report as if Colonel Roure has assumed that the quite exceptional effort made in the first half of the present year, by means of which we shall have raised by the end of the year a total of 700,000 (not 800,000) additional recruits, including 260,000 (not 360,000) of the 18-year-old class, was part of a normal process which can be continued into next year. It does not appear that Colonel Roure was furnished with any recruiting estimate for 1919. But Sir Auckland Geddes has made it clear to the Prime Minister that if authorised programmes of production are to be maintained, the total recruited in 1919 is not likely to exceed 300,000. There can be no question under these circum-stances of our capacity to maintain our army at the same strength, or anything like the same strength, during 1919. A similar misconception underlies, I suspect, the references made at one or two points in the report to my own promises, or assurances, with respect to the future strength of the army. These were, of course, only with reference to the reconstitution of our divisions for the present fighting season, and of the same character as the message which I sent to M. Clemenceau on the 14th June.* I never contemplated the possibility that the effort to reconstitute our divisions for the critical months which we had to face before the American army could arrive and take its place in the line could be sustained indefinitely.To sum up: Colonel Roure&apos;s main conclusions as to the large reserve of man-power still available in this country and not yet mobilised, or already mobilised but not properly used, have been based, firstly, on a purely arbitrary assumption as to the number of men required for our maritime and industrial effort an assumption wmich would never have been advanced if Colonel Roure had consulted the opinion of French experts on these matters and secondly, on certain false analogies and misleading comparisons between the conditions of the French and British military organisations, which have been dealt with in these notes. They are conclusions, consequently, which have no real relevance to the actual facts, and cannot possibly furnish the basis of any discussions between the two Governments. There are a good many other points of detail in the report which one might feel disposed to controvert. But it has been sufficient, I think, for the purpose in hand, to confine myself to the analysis which I have given of the fundamental misconceptions of the nature and character of- the British war effort which have underlain that report, and which, if left uncontroverted and unexplained, would not only do grave injustice to the British nation, but seriously imperil that complete mutual understanding and contt-dence which are the foundation of the Alliance and the only guarantee of success.MILNER,August 28, 1918.* &quot; I now can promise that we can reconstitute broken divisions to such an extent that, the total number of our divisions shall once more be at least equal to what it was at the openiug of the battle in Marcli.&quot;
