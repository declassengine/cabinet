f;&apos;G.T.^v).;&apos; seek128.8.18. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office,Russia/012.M B KORAN D U M onuRUSSIAN POLITICAL PARTIES. Their present Positiar^fncV Policy.The following memorandum is chiefly for the purposes of reference.   It is an attempt to analyse the various political parties and groups as they have developed under the Bolshevik regime.   It Is possible that after the fall of the Bolsheviks there may be an acute controversy between Republicans and Constitutional Monarchists.   In the course of such a controversy the latter may find themselves forced to lean on elements more to the Rightj such as the Church, which, under the Patriarch Tilchon, seems to be growing more and more reactionary.    It may fall to&apos; the Allies to have to mediate between these various group with a vie?^ to establishing a compromise acceptable to both.There has beon a great decrease in the interest taken in party politics as the result of the Bolshevik regime.   This is partly due to the ruthless suppression by the Bolsheviks of all political opposition, partly to the impossibility of inventing any political programme to compete with the lavish promises made by the Bolsheviks that are summed up in the words &quot;Peace, bread and land&quot;.   It is only now after 9 months of misgovernment and the failure of the Bolsheviks to redeem any of their fine promises that ^Lhe other political parties are likely to come again on top.Before examining in any detail the programme and the personnel of the various political groups, the. following.rough division
may be made.    (1) Extreme Right - monarchist, reactionary and pro-German.   (S) Bolsheviks - irreooncilables, opposed to all foreign Governments and all other political parties in Russia.    (5) Sight Centre - in favour of Constitutional Monarchy with military dictatorship during the war and Allied intervention.     (4) Left Centre ** republican, in favour of Constituent Assembly and Allied intervention.It is clear that, now that Allied intervention is an established fact, we shall have to work with the Central Bloc that includes the Liberal bourgeois and the moderate Socialist panties.     There are no differences between these groups   with regard to inter-vention and the general attitude towards the war;   where conflict may arise is in the discussion of the future form of Governmentt whether it Is to be monarchical or republican.*V* Right Centre   consists chiefly of former members of the Nationalist, Octobrist and Cadet parties in the Duma, though the only one of these which still exists as a party is the Cadet. Others who lave not enrolled themselves in the Cadet party belong to a group, formed shortly before the Bolshevik Revolution, known as the Public Men of Action (obshchestvenniye dyeyateli).(a) Cadets.     The Cadet party has, by the defection of Milyufcov, lost is acknowledged leader since the days of its foundation.   Other leading members such as Shingaryov and Kokoshkin have been murdered, while Maklakov is in Paris.   Thus&apos; there is no longer any acknowledged leader and the old. tendency to split into a Rciight and a Left wing appears to have become more pronounced. The split may of course be healed, but in the absence of Milyukov there will probably be new. developments.The Right wing is represented by Prince Eugene Trubetskoi and Novgorodtsev.    It is openly in favour of a Constitutional Monarchy, the candidate most recently discussed being Nikolai
If f.3.Kikhailovich, a cousin of the late Tsar and a distinguished scholar and historian.(b) Public Men of Action.     This group is in very close touch with the former and is led by Struve, Rodzyanko and Prince Dolgorukov.   It Is probably to this group that General Alexeyev would belong;   at any rate he&apos; is their choice as a Military Dictator for the period of the war.     Their main concern is the restoration of order and, like the Right wing of the Cadets, they favour a Constitutional Monarchy as the future form of Government.2*     Left Centre, including Left Cadets, Populist Socialists, Social Revolutionaries, and Mensheviks.(a) Left Cadets,   The leaders of this group are said to be Kishkin and Astrov,    It is uncertain whether they have returned to the idea of a Constitutional Monarchy (the original programme of the Cadet party) during the last few months, but they are in close touch with the moderate Socialists and would probably offer no objection to the idea of a Republic as the future form of Government.   They are a useful bridge between the groups further to the Right and the Socialists on the Left.   It is amongst these men that Kerenski tried to choose his former Ministers.     One of the chief complaints made by the Cadets against Kerenski is that he and Nekrasov tried to split the Cadet party into two.(b) Social Revo1utionaries.     This, probably the largest of the Socialist parties, is now split into three groups - Right, Centre and Left.(I) Right.   Agree to co-operate with the bourgeoisie in the same Government and take up a vigorous and determined line In favour of national defence.   Strongly opposed to the Zimmerwaldlsm of Chernov.   Represented by Kerenski, Breshko-Breshkovskaya (who remains as enthusiastic about Kerenski as formerly) and Lebedev, former Minister of
Marine under kcrenski.    In bo far as Savinkov belongs to any party he would probably support this group, though they criticise him for the violence of his actions.(II) Centre,     Led by Chernov, who during the last few.months has been coming more and more into line with the Right wing, but is very much   distrusted by them.     Rusanov, now in Stockholm, is one the leading representatives of this group. This group, formerly the most numerous In the S.R, party, has been losing steadily in influence owing to the weakness of the line taken by Chernov.     Qotz, who was formerly one of the prominent figures in the group, has joined the Right wing which is also strengthened by the presence of&apos; Avksentyev there,(III) Left.     Led by Spiridonova, Kamkov and Karelin., At first they co-operated with-the Bolsheviks, but refused to sign the Brest peace.     After the coup d!etat in Kiev which led to the appointment of Skoropadski they started a violent campaign against the Bolsheviks for not going to the help of the Ukrainian peasants.     They are not members of the so-called Left Centre, being sentimental revolutionaries, violently anti-German, but also strongly opposed to Allied intervention,(Q) &quot;Populist Socialists.      A small but influential group of &quot;intellectuals, closely akin to the Right Social Revolutionaries.   Social reformers rather than Socialists.     Not internationalists.   Their leaders are Pyeshekhonov (Minister of Food in Kerenski&apos;s Government) and Myakotin.Mensheviks.Centre. - The Mensheviks proper, as opposed to the Bolsheviks. Formerly led by Tsereteli and Chkheidze whoare now in G eorgia.   The present leaders are Dan and Lieber.
jjSkobelcv, formerly one of the leaders of this party, is now [probably less internationalist and more to the Right.Left. -   The Menshevik-Internationalists, often spoken of as the &quot;Novaya Zhizn&apos;1 group. , Before the Bolshevik Revolution they showed much sympathy for the Bolsheviks, but refused to join their Government, and the cleavage between them has been growing steadily.   The leaders are Martov, Sukhanov, Abramovich. Gorki also belongs to this group.There are three groups closely associated with the Left Centre which should be mentioned here;-(1) The &quot;Unity&quot; (Yedinstvo) group, formerly led by Plekhanov, now led by Alexinski and Leo Deutsch.     They have always taken up a strojigly patriotic line towards the war even before the Revolution.     They repudiate everything savouring of Zimmerwaldism,  aid are strongly in favour of Allied Inter-vent Ion.(2) Defencist Social Democrats (Oborontsi).   A small group of intellectuals led by Potresov.   Their organ is the Dyen (&quot;Day&quot;) now suppressed by the Bolsheviks.   Strongly in favour of Allied intervention.(3) The Co-Operatives   led by Prokopovich,   Ohaikovski, of the new Archangel Government, is also a prominent leader. Under the Bolshevik regime the Co-Operatives have been careful not to play a political part,  cs they were given certain privileges by the Bolsheviks, such as non-interference with their bank, the Narodni Bank.     It is only recently, therefore, that Prokopovich has been willing to commit himself in favour of Allied intervention.
