Memorandum that I believe the help that the Transport  Workers&apos; Battalions have given in the Ports and on the Railways has contributed materially to the rate at which the U.S. Troops have been brought overi     Without their help, it would again and again have been impossible to maintain the convoy sailing dates.Yours faithfully.(Signed)   NORMAN HILL.-Colonel Sir Maurice P-.A.HankoylK.C.B. Secretary,,War Cabinet, S.W.1,( ii)    Memorandum.1.   The strength of the Battalions T,-as increased on the 27th. April 19l8 under the instructions of the War Cabinet (llth April 19l8)x from 10,000 to 15,000 men, to enable this jbinet   Committee to provide assistance not only in the Ports but also 19,        on the Railways and Canals and in the Steal Works. In.8.)
2 -2.   After providing the men needed to maintain the Headquarters of the Battalions, (10 in number) and after allow-, ing for sickness, absence, leave etc., the strength actually-available for employment on civilian work does not exceed 13,000.3.,   There are to-day actually employed on civilian labour 12,710 men of the Battalions, and applications for the assistance of upwards of 1,200 men to meet proved deficiencies cannot be met4.   The rapid turn round in port, of the vessels running in the Fast Convoys bringing in the U.S.Troops has greatly in-ereased the demands on the Battalions for assistance.     Again and again the fast vessels would have missed sailing dates if it had not been for the assistance given.5*   The traffic on the canalo has been considerably increased to the relief of the Railways.&apos;   The special Battalion allotted to Canal Work is fully employed and there are constant demands for assistance which cannot be met.6. &apos; The work done by the men o^ the Battalions on the Railways is increasing.7.   The. Battalions have only been used to supplement proved deficiencies in the available supply of civilian labour, and.the work has been done in cordial co-operation with the Civilian Workers.8.   Transport difficulties are always greater in Winter than in Summer as congestion is caused by fog, rain and snow, and the shorter days, but the experience of the last 2 months has shown that even working under Summer conditions the strength at- present available is not sufficient to meet urgent demands,9.    If the flow of essential traffic thro1 the ports and over the railways and canals is to be maintained during the coming Autumn and Winter the strength of the Eatta] ons must, in the opinion of the Port &amp; Transit Executive Committee be increased by a further 5,000 men. &apos;(Signed)   NORMAN HILL.CHAIRMAN.&apos;Port and Transit Executive Commi11ee.23rd August, 1918.
