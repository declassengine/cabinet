MINISTRY   OP   SHIPPINGProposed increase In the strength of the transport Workers T BattalionsNOTE   BY   THE   SHIPPING   CONTROLLERThe Shipping Controller strongly supports the recommendation of the port &amp; Transit Executive Committee in G.T. 6503 that the strength of the Transport Workers1 Battalions should be at once Increased by ft further 5,000 men.Shortage of labour in the ports has again made itself severely felt, as is evidenced by a recent very serious slowing down in the turn round of Atlantic transports.   An analysis of the time spent in port in this country by 33 ships engaged in American trooping shews an average stay of l$i days against an estimate of 8 days realised by the same ships earlier in the year.As Sir Norman Hill points out the conditions are bound to become more difficult with the approach of winter and it is essential therefore that immediate action should be taken to provide the additional labour required.27th August. 1918.
