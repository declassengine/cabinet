TIC STATE OTi1 IRELAND.I.II.III. IV.Report by Lord FrenchLetter from. G. 0, C*-in-C , in Ireland, to Lord &quot;FrenchThe ForcesReport by Inspector-General, Royal Irish Constabulary, for north of July, 1Q18.Report on movements and meetings of extremists in the Dublin Police Area during month of July, 19l8.30.8.18, 30.8.18.9,8.18,2.8.18.(I)Report by Field-Marshal Viscount French.Turing the last month the decrease in the activity of the militant section of the Sinn &quot;Fein has been very noticable.   This is partly owing to the strength and counter measures of the IrishGovernment, and partly owing to the wholebi nnnnand organization being taken up with Franchise work. They anticipate that if their work in this respect is successful they will be able to wl^e out the Irish National Party at the next election, and that the whole of the County Government, representing an annual expenditure of  4,800,000, will come under their control.     This is a very subtle move on their part, as they anticipate by this means they will be able to obtain control of the essential &quot;centres of administrativework throughout Ireland.and thus be enabled to carry on their work without the necessityof pursuing the risky, and violent ---------      ..... 1in their leaders being deported.propaganda which has resulted&apos;This ne\. move on the part of the extremists needs very careful watching and renders it essential that there should be no modification of the present policy of the Irish Government 0On the other side there are signs of improvement in the attitude of the people towards the police.     In many places where in May and June the general public were afraid to be seen speaking to them, confidence, arising from the increased feeling of security of the individual, is gradually restoring the friendly relations so essential between the populace and the police.It has always been the case in Ireland in the past that, when a &apos;cecret society through its dangerous propaganda has come under the ban of the law, an endeavour is made to transfer it3 work to some other society, and to carry out its machinations under the aegis of some association not so actively aggressive. This is apparent at the present time.   The Sinn   Feiners are taking advantage of the Transport Workers Union and the Gaelic Athletic Association for the. carrying on of their work.    Some considerable time mu&quot;st elapse before effective moans can be found for dealing with this, and finally putting to rest the seditious movements still smouldering under the surface and only awaiting a favourable &quot;opportunity to renew their pernicious endeavours.Lublin.(Signed)   FRENCH.30th.

Copy of lottor from General Officer Commanding-Tn-ChiOf^.Tlii ,fejlc g7in&quot; Ireland;&quot;&apos;to ;Lord French.General Hoadquartero,&apos; Ireland, Parkgate, Puhlin,  , 30th August, -1918.Your Excellency..I have the honour to submit the following remarks on the general situation in Ireland as viewed from a military stand-point, for the month of August.STATE OF COUNTRY.The country taken as a whole., has certainly behaved in a more law-abiding manner,- and with the exception of minor instances no organized attempts have been: made&apos; to seriously oppose or disregard restrictions which- have been enforced by military proclamations.The people are all extremely busy over their harvest and have, therefore, no. time or inclination to cause trouble. -In spite of this apparent improvement,&apos; all my information goes1 to Bhpw that the country is:still-very unsettled and that.this unrest is due in a largo measure to the uncertainty as to the intent&amp;uns of the Government,,     This unrest&apos; is being diligently fostered by the leaders as they hope it will force the Government &quot;to abandon conscrip-tion and thus again bring ridicule on English rule.     The .people believe in Your Excellency&apos;s intentions but they are doubtful as to whether you.will be supported by the Government.PRILLING.Although there has been no -actual recurrence of illegal drilling on anything, like an organized&apos; scale;    on Lady fay the 15th August, certain small attempts were made to drill in out of the way parts of the country; -these. however, were of very minor importance and did not call for military intervention.SPECIAL MILITARY AREA.Acting-, in accordance-.with the&apos; policy I outlined in my last report with regard to Special&apos; Military Areas, I have withdrawn the restrictions entirely from Tralee and from.the County of Clare, but they still remain Proclaimed as Special Military Areas.     It was-considered desirable to do this so that in event of it proving necessary,....the - restrictions could be again imposed if it should be. found necessary to do so.The-action with regard to Tralee has so far proved successful,, but in Clare, although the&apos;County, as&apos; a whole,&apos; remained quiet and orderly, an attack was made upon a soldier 4. the Tomgraney district&apos; for no. other reason beyond-the fact that he Has &quot;a soldier?, and-restrictions,. .confining the inhabitants inside their&apos;houses between the hours of&apos; 9. p.m, and 5 p.m. and the closing&apos; of Public Houses during certain hours, were immediately and very properly imposed upon this district by the Commandant of the Area.
MILITARY ACT ION. iiI ara glad to bo able to report that, during the period under review, it has only boon necessary on a few occasions to supply military Support or assistance to the police   The troops under my command, however, acting in accordance with the general scheme which I have adopted for Ireland, have been gaining valuable local information by patrolling the country, The troops are becoming well acquainted with the particular areas in which they are stationed;   and by a system of patroll- \ ing which I have ordered, they are making themselves familiar with the coast line especially in these localities which offer possibilities of a hostile landing-The various Schemes of Defence for the large towns and for all places where troops are stationed have now been prepared, and are ready to be put in operation if necessary.MILITARY RELATIONS &apos;7ITH - CIVILIANS .The relationship between the Civilians and the Military is only fair though I hope it is improving, During the past month there, have been minor instances showing hostility on the part of the inhabitants such as tho placing of stones on roads in front of Despatch Riders, cutting of field telegraph wires, etc. The most serious of these instances was the attack upon a soldier near Tomgraney, County Clare.STRENGTH OE EjOROES .The total forces under my command is 111,222 of these 59,572 are being trained as drafts for overseas.     Of the remainder 41,731 are either temporarily or permanently unfik for service overseas-     This leaves a total of 9 ,&quot;9*19 Class 1.1. and B-iii who are retained in Ireland, owing to the unsettled state of the country.     All these Tatter are either in Cycliot units. Artillery, or Engineers, and if at any time, they become &quot;A&quot; Class they are available for drafting overseas.I have the honour to bes.Your Excellency&apos;1&apos;s Obedient Servant,(Sgd..)

There is, however, no reason to believe that political discontent and disaffection have abated, though owing to the firmer attitude of Government and the vigorous action of tho Police supported&quot; by the Military, public exhibitions of dis-loyalty and instances of open defiance of the law were very few.Agriculture, the staple industry, continued to yield large profits, and the present shortage of coal has enabled the Western farmers to raise the price of fatrf to more than double its normal figure.     The crops, including flax, give promise of a good harvest.Manufacturing industries and trade generally were in a prosperous state, and employment was plentiful - in fact the demand for agricultural labour in some places appears to exceed the supply which is remarkable considering that emi-gration has practically oeased, but no new cases of industri development of importance were reported.The relations between employers and workmen wers on the whole amicable and wages have been everywhere substantially increased^Labour organization, referred to in previous reports, continued to make steady progress, and there were several strikes, including one at the Oork oteampacket Co. involving 200 hands.    None of these strikes, however, were of suffi-cient magnitude to cause serious dislocation of business.A certain amount of irritation is caused by the suspen-sion of land purchase, and agrarian agitation was prevalent in the Counties of Clare, Galway, Kelkenny, Mayo, Queen1s Co and Westmeath, but chiefly as usual in Clare and the two Eidinsrs of Galway,&apos;lu fftb area consisting of the last three Counties in-timidation was rife and 150 persors were afforded Police pro tcction.The tenantry on a few Estates in different Counties con tinufcd to withhold payment of rent with a view to compel the landlords to agree to a sale.    On the Jordan estate in County Mayo, a number of decrees for possession have been made against the tenants, but there was no attempt to execute them.The community was comparatively free from ordinary crime, the number of Indictable Offences reported in July * being exactly the same as in the preceding Month, though there was an increase in those of an agrarian charaoter.The following cases ma^ t*   Aecially mentioned :-ONE.      On July 8^th. Colonel Lowry*e shooting Lodge at Clenlask was raided, and 4 rifles anu. some ammunition stolen.L17AY E.R/- n June 28th. Mr. Ralph Walker of Ballygar district&apos; received a threatening letter by post in consequence of h:;.s having supplied butter and milk to the police, when others had refused to do so.     The local Sinn Fein organization under the leadership of the P.P., Father Kielty, is believed to have instigated this.
t&quot;1ty s) fj/v/ t&apos;vOn the night of July 2nd, two revolver shoes -ere fired &apos; into the house of James Kelly, near Ballinager, with theobject of causing him to withdraw his cattle from grazing lands which the local people desire to be divided between them,GALWAY W.R.   On 3rd July at midnight three disguised men with guns.---------------    broke into the house of Michael Pooley, gamekeeper axCoole demeans and took away a gun and some cartridges.On the night of July 23th, a-shot -as fired into the house of Michael Francis at Henlo, to intimidate him into giving up a farm&apos;he acquired 2 years ago and which local people court,CORK E.&apos;R.       Between June 30th and July 4th. the Protestant Church atKilbolane, Mallow, was broken into and the Communion table and paws were damaged.   The motive assigned is that 2 families who comprise the Congregation refused to sign the anti-conscription pledge,   No evidence for arrests.On Runday 14th July the outrage was denounced, by the priests at each of the services at the Local RvC. Church, and at a meeting after Mass the Parish Priest collected  5 to be offered as a reward for information which will lead to the arrest of the perpetrators.CORK E.R.       On the night of July 13th. 4 farm houses in Oarrignavan dist.were raided for arms.    The raiders only got one gun - at one of the houses the occupier refused to give up his gun. whereupon the raiders fired 2 shots into his dining-room and decamped,[CORK W.R,       On July 7th. while two police who had taken part in thesuppression of a leis near Ballyvourney were&quot;returning on a car to their barracks they were attacked at Coolea by a party of 10 men in ambush and all disguised,One constable was shot through the neck, and the other was beaten until he was insensible.While in this state their rifles. ammunition and accoutrements were stolen.On the following day a notice was posted on the R.C.Church warning persons against speaking to the Police &quot;in the. interests of the public safety&quot;,No evidence can be obtained. &quot;The two Police are recovering.LARS. On the night of July 21st. the house of Nicholas McMahonnear Ennis, was fired into, because he had taken a farm, and had not compensated the son of the former tenant who had sold the farm 8 years ago..Several threatening letters were sent to persons in various districts in this County in connexion with agrarian disputes, and petty outrages, such as the spiking of meadows, were committed, and two men who had carried turf to the police at Doolin wore fired at and wounded.In the Counties   where the keeping of arms, unless with a permit, is forbidden by order of the Commander-in-Chief under the B.R.R. the police in the exercise of their powers of search have seized a number of guns and many persons have been prosecuted.Raids for arms by Sinn Peiners have practically ceased,,Following the instalment of a firmer regime, and the curtailment of the.licence assumed by the Sinn Fein party, an impreve-nent Is noticeable in the attitude towards.the Police of the general public in places where they had become afraid to be seen speaking to them.
9 a 9 6 6 Jr  6 -There is, however, still a very unsatisfactory feeling of hostility towards the Constabulary,, and. at Castleblakeney and Ballygar they are partially &quot;boycotted at the instigation of the Sinn -Feiners -: in&apos; the latter district they would have been unable to procure any turf but for the assistance of the Congested &quot;Districts&quot; Board..:  ;&apos;;   In a Kerry village, a- shopkeeper - the only Protestant inhabitant - is.boycotted because he refused to sign the antit-conscription pledge, and two Protestant farmers in the same County are.also boycotted for having supplied milk to soldiers at a neighbouring camp.The failure of Special Juries at the Cork Assizes to convict in some cases in which the evidence apparently presented little or no difficulty is .suggestive of.intimidation.One of these was the Siivermines-Murder Case.     An old&apos; man named Sheehah&apos; was fatally shot by men who raided&apos; his house for a rifle which his son/ a soldier,; had brought home with him on furlough.     After a strong charge by the Judge the Jury disagreed,- and the two accused person were put back to the next Assizes..&quot; ?        -;---&apos;Only 3^2 men are reported as &apos;havlng. enlisted in tho Army and Navy during the period of 4 weeks&apos;to July l th - about the worst return on record since the outbreak of War.Some public bodies have flatly ,declined to receive deputations from the Recruiting Committee and .so far as one may judge up to the present there,would seem to. be little &apos; prospect of a satisfactory response&apos;to tire Lord Lieutenant1s appeal for&apos;-JO,000 men..    The Roman Catholic Clergy are certainly giving no help in the matter,The subscriptions to the National Defence Fund for the purpose of resisting Conscription, as published in the Press, now amount to  250.000,

- ** -   . .......     cd 91-PART II.On July 3rd the Lord Lieutenant issued a Proclamation under Section 6 of the Criminal Law &amp; Prooedure Act, 1887, de-glaring the following Associations to be dangerous     ,The Sinn Fein Organization,Sinn Fein Clubs,The Irish Volunteers,The Cuman na MBan,The Gaelic League,On July 4th an Order was published by the Commander-in-Ohief tender D.R.R. 9 AA. prohibiting meetings, assemblies, . or processions in public places within the whole of Ireland, unless authorized in -writing by the Chief Commissioner, D.M.Polioe, ir the Metropolis, or by the County Inspectors in the proy4&quot;^..-xWimmgb Axuil vox-s&amp;ry&quot; of July 12 th,        o^xebxmCtf by meetings throughout Ulster on that date, the promoters having applied for and obtained permits.     The political character of the celebrations was this year resumed.     The attendance.was . larger than for some years-past;   the various contingents were preceded by bands and banners and drumming parties;   but there was no attempt at military display and all passed off in an orderly manner.     The largest meeting was at Finaghy, near Belfast, where Sir E, Carson addressed a gathering of about 14,000 people.Sir Edward Carson also tulfilled several other engagements between July 11th.and 15 th*,.including a meeting.of the Unionist-, Labour Party and of tho Standing Committee of the Ulster Unionist Council.    Apart from, this the Unionist Societies were inactive.The United Irish League, and the Ancient Order of Hiber-nians (Board of Erin), which support the policy of the Irish Parliamentary Party, displayed little activity.     They resent the Commander-in-Chief1s Order of July 4th. and object to ask for permits and consequently no meetings of any importance were held.The Sinn Seiners were quietly active, but only 16 new Sinn Fein Clubs came under the notice of the Police during the Month, bringing the total number, of Clubs in the Provinces on July 51st to 1337, with a membership estimated at about 109,700.The Irish Volunteers displayed no open activity, and as their management is conducted secretly there are no reliable means&apos; of estimating their numerical^strength, but as stated in previous reports they probably embrace tho majority of the members of Sinn Fein Clubs who are of military age.The progress of the Sinn Fein movement has&apos;been checked by the prohibition of public gatherings, which had been availed -of as an effective means of spreading disaffection and by the internment of its most important leaders - it is believed that the places of these men have been filled, but no new leaders have openly asserted their position.The increased powers taken by Government for dealing with the mischief caused by seditious gatherings and with open de-fiance&apos; of the law are generally approved by moderate people, &apos; and have already been productive of good&apos; results in restoring confidence among the loyal population, and in showing the dis-affeeted that they can no longer count on being able to defy constituted authority with impunity.
tv^ Commander-in-Chief &apos;s Order prohibiting assemblies, in it, wide S    &quot;vwnB all kinds of meetings without exception ! , I   Y ;avo rise to a good deal of comment.     It hoe bucnTotiAok oweY-r   for the prosont to enforce it only in the case cflho larger political and somi-politieal meetings and processions in public places.Several meetings were advertised in spite of the prohibition. In rvnv instances the promoters, on being warned that ^7.^1%,, not be7allowed unless permits were applied for, made no attempt to hold them.     In others crowds assembled and were dispersed by Police supported by Military without any attempt at resistance: in some cases of disorderly and seditious behaviour, the ringleaders are being prosecuted for unlawful assembly.The proclamation of County Clare and of Tralee as Special Military Areas remains in force, and has apparently had a deterrent effect in other turbulent districts.Drilling has practically been discontinued, partly in obedience to&apos; orders from Sinn Fein Head Quarters, but mainly, no doubt, in consequence of the activity of police patrols, supported in the more disturbed Counties by Military - only a few isolated and unimportant cases occurred during the Month, and the principal offenders were prosecuted.The demeanour of accused persons in Court has become leas truculent, and at Killarney Petty Sessions two men convicted of drilling apologised and promised not to repeat the. offence.The resolve to oppose Conscription, sanctioned and supported by the R.C.Bishops and backed by a Defence Fund of a quarter of a million pounds, showed no sign of weakening, but there appears to be a growing belief that the measure will not be put iri force.According to information from a reliable source, a private meeting of the Sinn Fein and Irish Volunteer Executive was held in Dublin at which there were a great many speeches and proposals, but nothing definite was decided.The only prints on which they agreed were that everything should be done to keep the man nower in the countrv, that British law should.not be recognized, and that no permits for meetings should be applied for, and further that advantage should be taken of the Transport v/orker&apos;s Union and the   Gaelic&quot;Athletic Association for Sinn Fein organization purposes.-    . .. -  . - .   . ^r,      The younger members present --ere for openly defying the Proclamations, but the older and more influential members were against this, on the grounds that it might deprive thern of the support of the Catholic Hierarchy and interfere with the unitv oi the people, in opposing Conscription..Informant also reports that at a provincial executive meeting a delegate who had attended the Dublin&quot;meetin? explained what had*nW&amp; ss&amp;M^? $HAT uirviTi ssurThe recent searching of houses of   arms by the Police affordedVowe r? ?i ^ &quot;&quot;&quot;^ of the Irish      &quot;Volunteers   of the influence exercised by Sinn Fein over theand hni 2 - Secret circulation of seditious literature,and has resulted in some prosecutions.
fa) w 5In one house a letter was found from tho Secretary at Sinn Fein Head Quarters.     It was evidently written in reply to a . correspondent who asked for instructions as to whether he might apply for a permit to hold 0.A.A. Sports, and contains the following statement :-     , &quot;Our organization raUst not seek from &quot;the English Military Government in Ireland any permission &quot;whatsoever as they havfe no authority from the people to permit &quot;or to prohibit any national activities..&quot;Sinn Fein propaganda has saturated the minds of the younger generation with revolutionary ambitions and hatred of England, but there is no evidence pointing to importation of arms or readiness for rebellion, and unless in the event of a German landing, a fresh outbreak would still appear to be unlikely.The whole country is, however, in a state of acute political unrest, rendering the maintenance of a strong Military force absolutely necessary.(Signed)   J.
