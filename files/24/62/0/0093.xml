S ECREI,        fi/ V A R   CABINET.G.T.-559.5.      /POLICY WITH REGARD TO A GENERAL ELECTION. Note by Lord Robert Cecil.My Agent writes to me that the Labour-Pacifist candidate in ray Division is working very hard.   He is not talking about the Ear, but about wages, housing,  and so on.    It is thought that he is having some success amongst the labourers and their wives,   Eeanwhile, I am to some extent paralysed by the so-called Party-Truce,  and also by the urgency of official work.   If there is to be no Genera11. Election for some time to come, that does not very much matter.   If, however, the Election is to take place next Autumn, the case is different.Similarly, my Agent informs me that, in view of the great shortage of materials,and labour, he ought to give orders immediately for necessary printing,  and so on,  if there is to be an Election in the Autumn.I should be very glad to know, if possible, what the policy of the Government on this matter is.The objections to an Election are manifold and obvious. On the other hand, unless it is to be definitely put off, the period between now and its ultimate occurrence will become more and more devoted to electioneering..   Frankly I do not myself see how any Minister can find time for both electioneering and official work,  during the War.(Intd.)   R. C.Foreign Offoe, S.W.I.September 2nd, 1918.
