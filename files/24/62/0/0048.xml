3JL1* 29th August, 1018,Tmivmrm by the nwm op tie diriporialWA1EBS OP IIQRWAY.Aduaralty Ilo^iorandum for the War Cabinet.With reference to Admiralty Paper No, G.T.5280, dated 31st July.. 191(3, this matter is now dragging on to an extent v/hxch. is causing us serious concern. &apos; At the time when the Aeliiralty notified to the War Cabinet that enemy suh:iarines were using Norwegian Territorial Waters, the Jline Barrage;fw$sg:gradually being laid towards the coast of the Orlmeys.   Early in September the Adrriralty will be in a position to oonplote.the Barrage into the Orkney Islands.;. ;.-Without: troubling the Cabinet with the technical reasons, it will be sufficient to state that j-lining into the Orkneys will cause great difficulty and a certain amount of navigational danger to tho Scandinavian Convoys, which the Adniralty have undertaken to incur in order to make the Barrage as effective as possible.   It is, however, quite&quot;useless to incur this difficulty and danger if the Norwegian passage is not closed. Prom all the evidence which cones to the Adiiiralty we arc of the opinion that the Barrage is having, a very narked effect upon the freedon of action of the subnarinee,and that it will be of (preat advantage to our anti-submarine war when the two ends are closed;   but obviously it is no use closing our end at the Orkneys with its attendant great difficulties to the Scandinavian trade, until the Norwegian end is closed.It is, therefore, submitted to tho Cabinet that the tine has now arrived when moreactive steps should be taken to insist upon Norway effectively closing the passage in her territorial waters which is today being .froely used. -So far as we are able to judge from the telegrans which have passed, the present position in the negotiations going on at Christiania is as follows :-On August 19th Sir II. Findlay saw the Norwegian Foreign Minister and, after supplying proofs that Norwegian territorial rights had been infringed by German submarines, urged that tho Norwegian Government should mine their waters as the only effective means of obtaining the desired object, and handed him a formal communication in accordance with instructions from the Foreign Office.?ho r&apos;rench and Italian :Iiriisters supported the British action, but the United States Minister could not obtain instructions to do- more than to urge upon the Norwegian Government , as he did on August 20th that ; lining would be the most, effectual means of dealing with tho situation,   It is stated that the United States Government arc opposed to using threatening language towards Norway and they are convinced that with gentle handling the Norwegian Government will ultimately como round to. our point of view.
The Norwegian Government have comrmniicated with Berlin complaining of the infringement of their territorial rights, but, they had received no reply-up to the 26th when Sir M. Findlay pointed out to the Norwegian Foreign Minister that if the Germans denied that their submarines had entered Norwegian Waters, he could mine them without being accused of adopting measures against Germany and that he could also do so if nhe Germans admitted mistakes and promised not&apos;to repeat them.   The only answer made&quot;&quot; by the Norwegian Foreign Minister to Sir IvL Findlay was a vague one to the effect &quot;that seme thing would have to be done&quot;.The French Minister has strongly advised the Norwegian Government to mine their waters but has not mentioned any time limit within which this must be done, and so far the only mention of possible action on the Allies1 part, if the Norwegians fail to meet their wishes,is a passage in the conmmioation handed by Sir H, Findlay to the Norwegian Foreign Minister on August 19th that in order to give time kto the Norwegian&quot; Government to eenvince thensftlves &quot;that mining? is necessary, H,M*Government are prepared to &quot;postpone any action for a short period&quot;.The United States Charge d1Affaires appears to have received instructions from Washington that he is te act independently of other Allied Representatives: and that the United States Government de n&amp;t sympathise with any action calculated to infringe the Sovereignty of Norwegian Territorial Waters.It is quite clear that unless the Allies taJce more definite steps a conclusion may be postponed sine die.-   .
