11, BftMAiiK.   &apos; The negotiations between the Danish delegates and the United States far Trade Board are now practically completed.    An agreement has been reached on the subject of Danish exports to Cor-many;   and tho rations for Danish imports (with the solo exception of nitrates) have been settled.    As regards the Anglo-Danish Shipp-ing Agreement, H*M* Government are disposed to concede the Danish request that the ships which come under the Agreement shall be re-valued on a higher basis;   it has also been deoided, in deference to juanioh objections, to omit the proviso that our shipments of coal to Denmark shall be liable to suspension on account of British and Allied requirements.    This laetoonoession is only a matter of form;   for H.M. Government will make it clear that, in ease of an emergency, we shall be&apos;unable to licence the export of the full monthly ration of coal to which Denmark is entitled by the written Agreement.SW&amp;M.     Tho Allied Ministers at,Stockholm have presented a collee-********* *tK**an*aBk ,(*tive note, protesting that the exports from Sweden to Germany, which are guaranteed in the German-Swedish Goal Agreement of April last, are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Swedish Agreement with the Allies.    The Swedish Prime Minister is disposed to argue the point.    He maintains that Sweden&apos;s promises to the Allies, involv-Ing as they do a change in &quot;the whole course of the country1s foreign trade, could not be, end were not in fact expected to be, fulfilled immediately;   and he states that Germany must receive the balance of tho goods due to her under the Goal Agreement, with the exception of 40,000 tons of pyrites, which are only promised under a private agreement.    Tho Allied Ministers suggest that, to safeguard our interests for the future, we should insist upon being supplied with copies of the outstanding agreements between.Sweden and Germany
i.  . - ill(tho Coal Agreement and the Shipping ^afe Conducts Agreement), end also with full monthly statementa of Swedish exports showing the countries of destination. , *i. NOffKAY.     She Allied Blockade Committee have recommended that, subjectto the concurrence of the United states, tho allies should accept the . compromise offered by the Norwegian Government as to black-listed firms in Norway.    Under tho compromise a number of firms will be whitewashed whom we had meant to keep on the black list;   but all who are white-washed will have to give us a stiffor guarantee than was origjnally contemplated.* JSEOTiHLAIDS.      gormen pressure on the netherlands has weakened very re-markably with the Change of the military situation in France;   and no compensation is at present being demanded for the coal which the $etherlands receive from germany.    the germans we are told would now sign practically any agreement with the Netherlands which would ensure; the export to germany of moderate quantities of Dutch foodstuffs,   fort-unately the&apos; butch.havo little food to spare.    they do not propose- to export any butter at present, or more than 8,000 tons of cheese.    They coulci spare about 3,00.0 tons, of milk, 8,000 tons of sugar, and a oon-si&amp;erable quantity of vegetables.    but it is probable *that the germane. will have to take compensation.in the shape of cattle and horses for part of the goods which they supply to the Netherlands - principally coal, iron and steel, salt, potash, dyes, cement and machinery.   cattle they are not very anxious to receive;   horses would be more useful to thorn, but the Dutch can only spare 1,000 full grown horses and 7,000 foals.-    there&apos; are largo&apos; stocks of hides end calf-skins available for . export from the Netherlands. - But       government have objected in the pas to the export of hides, and will probably not withdraw their opposition now.We have asked the United States to make no temporary,concessions as to Butch imports which might weaken the dosire of the Butch people
for a comprehensive sottlociont of this subject.     The appointment of anew Prime Minister is not yet announced, but there is rearon to expectvanthat the Cabinet of M. Cort/dor Linden will shortly be succeeded by a body of men who are less afaaid of Germany and more convinced of the neoeseity for making an economic treaty with the Allies.RUSSIA.   ffive Russian vessels of a total carrying capacity of 10,300 tons will shortly sail from Archangel to the United Kingdom to fetch supplies of foodstuffs for the Archangel peasants.    They are being des- j patched at the Instance of Mr. Lindloy, who considers it important that we should furnish 32,000 tone of flour, 2,000 tons of sugar and 200 tons of tea and coffee with the least possible delay.    Those are the minimum requirements of the peasants for the forthcoming winter and their attitude towards our expeditionary forces will probably be de-termined by our decision in this matter.    He proposes that we should supervise the distribution of these supplies, to ensure that they reach the proper quarters.There are 22,000 tons of flax, hemp and tow already at Archangel awaiting shipment to the United Kingdom, and another 18,000 tons, also for the United Kingdom, are on their way to that port.    Other goods waiting for us at Archangel in considerable quantities are Beet Seed, flax Seed, Plywood, Pitch and Tar.The Japanese Government have appointed a Committee of Economic Assistance in  Iberia.   The Committee will endeavour to provide food for the population and to revive the local industries.     It will pro-bably cooperate with, similar Committees appointed by Great Britain and the United States.SfflT&amp;^lLiUiJ).    The German Government have decided to supply Switzerland with no more steel.    They have cancelled outstanding contracts for deliveries during the last three months.of this year, and they will not allow any further contracts to be signed.    The reason for this action is that a number of Gorman stoel works will shortly be closed
