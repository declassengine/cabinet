9 //0It-Offices of the War Oabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.15th August, 1918.Dear Sir Eric Geddes,-I am afraid the brevity of the time at my disposal will prevent me bringing up in the Imperial Yfar Oabinet the subject dealt with in the Admiralty memorandum.I have, however, consulted the Prime Ministers of the Dominions, who, (with the exception of the Prime Minister of Newfoundland) have expressed their approval of the accompanying memorandum.The Prime Minister of Newfoundland has been requested to communicate with you direct ott the subject.: Faithfully yours,(Sd.) R.L. Eorden,The Right Hon.Sir Eric Geddes, K.O.E., G.E.E., H.P.,
MEMOMIOTM.The Doiainion Ministers, having considered the Admiralty Memorandum of May 17th, 1918, on the Naval Defence of the British Empire, which was circulated to the Imperial War Conference, 1918, submit the following conclusions and observations.1. The proposals set forth in the Admiralty Memorandum for a single navy at all times under a central naval authority are not considered practicable.2,   Purely from the standpoint of naval strategy the reasons thus put forward for the establishment of a single navy for the Empire, under a central naval authority, are strong but not unanswerable.    The experience gained in this war has shown that in time of war a Dominion Navy ( e.g. that of Australia), can operate with the highest efficiency as part of a united navy under one direction and command established after the outbreak of war.3.   It is thoroughly recognised that the character of construction, armament and equipment, and the methods and principles of training, administration and organisation, should rxroceed upon the same lines in all the navies of the Empire.    This policy has already been followed in those Dominions which have established naval forces.4.   For this purpose the Dominions would welcome visits from a highly qualified representative of the Admiralty who,-by reason of his ability and experience, would be thoroughly competent to advise the naval authorities of the Dominions in such matters.5.   As naval forces come to be developed upon a considerable scale by the Dominions it may be necessary hereafter to consider the establishment for war purposes of some supreme naval authority upon vi%ich each of the Dominions would be adequately represented.
