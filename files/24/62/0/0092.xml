&apos; 3d;(This document id the property of His Britannia Majesty!s. Government)fit W A R   OA BINE T.AFFORESTAT1CN.SECRET ............. Memorandum by the Minister of Reqenstruction,.0 .T u 5f5^^jI have read the decision of the War Cabinet of August 9th as recorded &quot;in the Minutes and I regret to say that 1 am unable to understand- preelsely what it Implies or how effect is to: be giizen to it.    As I was responsible in conjunction with the President of the. Board of Agriculture:, the Secretary for Scotland and the late Chief. Secretary for Ireland for submitting an agreed Scheme to the War Cabinet, I may, perhaps;/ be allowed to mention the following points whioh&apos;appear to require determination in order to clear up ihe position.1.    The recommendations of Lord Curzon and Mr-/Barnes left it open to the War Cabinet to set up a new Central Authority for afforestation or to constitute a special branch of the Development Commission for this purpose.   It is necessary to know upon which of these courses the War Cabinet have deelded.2,     Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes further recommended that loeal bodies should be established in England, Scotland, Ireland/ and Wales for carrying out the policy of the Central Authority., or, as an alternative, that the throe existing Boards of Agriculture should co-operate with the Central &apos; Authority in the execution of a forestry programme..   In this , case also It Is necessary to know upon which of these courses the War Cabinet have decided.   &apos;3.     If the reply to the foregoing questions is. that the War Cabinet have agreed in both cases to the second alternative. is it to be understood (as may be inferred from, a passage in the Minutes) that whereas in England and Ireland the Boards of Agriculture are to be responsible for administration in
Scotland some other arrangement Is to &quot;be ,made? j4.     On the ether, hand If the War Oabinet intend to set up a new Central Authority, is it their intention to leave it to the discretion of this-body (as recommended by Lord Ourzon and- Mr. Barnes) to 1 employ the existing Boards of Agriculture to carry out its policy .:.v. . frr to create new bodies for , the purpose.:1 ?5.    If this be the intention I woul/i respectfully suggest that some further indication should be given of the procedure whieh it is proposed to adopt in order to admit of action being taken with as little delay as possible, and what Ministers or Departments are to be responsible for its being taken *6,   To sum up - is it the intention of the War Cabinet to provide by statute for the setting up of an administrative forestry&quot;authority for England, Scotland and Ireland 17.   As Minister of Reconstruction; I am free to speak -unreservedly as to the heavy burdens which the problems of reconstruction are casting upon the Departments of Agriculture. It is obvious that the uncertainty as to their position both now and in future as regards afforestation must add to their difficulties and tend to tie their hands in a most important department of their work.   If their position and work in connection with forestry are to depend on the decision of a new Central Authority, it is, I think, due to the Departments concerned that they should be so informed?; and that their responsibilities- during the interval that must take place should &apos;be defined.0.     Take the question of seed, large quantities of which have been obtained in the expectation of a programme of afforestation being shortly formulated. - Are the Boards to obtain the nursery accommodation required for
planting ?   To plant out seedlings unless areas for planting have been scoured end plans worked out may he pure waste.and I think the Departments are entitled to know what is expected of them pending the setting up of a Central Boardo-.........-------- c. addfson.
