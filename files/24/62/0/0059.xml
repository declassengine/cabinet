Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.30th August, 1918.My dear General,Thank you for your letter of August 27th in regard to the transport of Coal to Italy.This question was discussed at a meeting of the Allied Maritime Transport Council which was held yesterday in London.It was decided that, owing to the stringency of the tonnage position, it was impossible to increase the shipments of coal by sea from JSnglahd in addition to what was already being shipped.With regard to the Wagon situation, I understand that Sir Sam Pay informed the mooting that wagons were now being sent to franco at the rate of 1,000 per week.   The general opinion of tho Council was that every effort should be made to increase the shipment of wagons to Franco,   In addition, according to a recent Report of action taken by tho Allied Maritime Transport Council, 60,000 tons of railway wagons, etc., j will have been shipped from America to France by the,end of August.Yours sincerely,(Signed).
