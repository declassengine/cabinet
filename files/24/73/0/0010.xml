 rrhiiHis Bnt;/   /i  G iveni merit.)-------   ssss^&apos;..&apos;    I  circulate the attached memorandum with regard  to  the proposals  of the Committee of Enquiry into Breaches  of  the Laws  of War.   My colleague, the Minister of Justice  concurs in the suggestions contained in the memorandum.(Sd,j  R.L.  SORDID.6th January, 1919.
SECRET.                      MEMORANDUM.             BREACHES OF THE LAVgOP WAR.       Referring to the Report ef the Committee of Enquiry lntftBreashea ef the Laws of War made to the Rt. Hon. Attorney Generaland dated 19th December 1918, the following suggestions are offered:-         Jurisdiction etc.,  That steps looking to the productionof evidence should be delayed&apos;.until the Treaty of Pef.ce would seem likely to defeat the object of&apos;the constitution of the court,Unless punishment is imposed promptly -its value would appear to bevery much reduced.   Possibly the court could be constituted forthwithupon the assembly of the Inter-Allied Conference, and steps taken toproceed forthwith in such cases  as can be at once dealt with.     IV and VII.  Constitution and procedure of the Tribunal.It would appear &quot;advisable to&quot; make prWisf6n&quot;Tbr  Juges d1 instruction1who could commence their duties  with the least possible delay.     JJ &apos;  Charges.  In order not unduly to prolong the labours ofthe court TTmight.be considered whether it would not be wiser to confine its activities within comparatively narrow limits and toa comparatively small number of  cases.   Actions possibly due tothe excitement of actual conflict with the enemy and those for whichthere is perhaps,a real justification might be excluded.   Toinelude the first class,might give ground for the charges against our own troops, end to include the latter would involve the courtin very numerous and interminable enquiries.   In this view seven of the Heads of Charges1 proposed by the Committee might be ellmin-ated, and it might either formally or at least practically belimited to the remaining seven combined as follows :-    (I) (5)  Systematic mistreatment of civil population             (terrorism, deportation and forced labour)   (4) (6)   Illegal executions  of hostages and others.   (9) (10)  Illegal submarine warfare (Including destruction             of hospital ships).   (12)      Systematic Illtreatment of prisoners.(Sd.)   O.M.  BIGGAR.              Lt.Col.Judge Advocate General (Canada).London,31st December, 1918.
