foj ft L*f-THE  SECRET SERVICE.10th January 1919./Ml OpjfrxMemorandum for the War Cabinet by the First  ^-ST^T^^SLord of the Admiralty.          I thinly that tho question of Secret Service demandsiittaediate and very oareful consideration by the Cabinet.   Speakingvery roughly, the present system is that the duties are divided between several different Offices.   The Admiralty and the War Officeefficiently control their own Secret Service, and take what steps are necessary in the interests of their respective Services, but thisis not so in regard to the civilian side of Secret Service.   TheHead of it is a most efficient officer, and his political Chief isthe Home Secretary, but for reasons which I donH pretend to under-stand, there does not seen to be anybody whose duty it is to call the attention of the Cabinet to serious reports when they are made,or - and this is most important of all - to see that the,necessary steps are taken.   And indeed so far as I am able to ascertain,there is not anybody &quot;whose iirrnediate duty it is to take those steps*Now I will only give two instances.   Many weeks before the trouble with the soldiers in London, Folkestone, and elsewhere, the civilianHead of the Seoret Service had called attention to the danger of trouble of the kind, had referred to it in plain and emphatic terms,and&apos; in cry/judgment, if it had been the duty of somebody to hold allthe strings and to call the attention of the Cabinet to the need forprompt action, the greater part, if not the whole of the troublewhioh arose might have been avoided.    The information which Ihave received from time to time through the reports and in inter-views I have had with Secret Service officers, leads me to theconclusion that what we call Bolshevism is due to a variety of causessome of them so apparently trivial as hardly to attract attention-I will give one of them.         A Secret Servioe officer told me qaite reoently that thenumber of motor cars used by young officers has enormously increased-,that they are to be seen outside cafes, restaurants, and other places of entertainment, where they are often kept waiting for avery long time, and are used to take their temporary owners fromone place of amusement to another, often in circumstances which give the drivers abundant opportunity for criticism and condemn a-tion.   These drivers return to their various garages and talk totheir friends very openly of what they have seen and heard, and I am assured that the remark is frequently made - &quot;Why should webe kept in the Army to do this kind of work&quot;?    Now thisparticular Secret Service officer went on to say that in hisopinion the popular theory that Bolshevism springs from the civilside, and gradually &quot;invades the idlitary, is not correct, that it more often than not originates on the military side, and hedeclared emphatically that cases like the one I have quoted of the motor cars, have more to  do with dissatisfaction and consequentmutinous aotion on the part of soldiers than have the greaterquestions of pay and allowances or even actual demobilisationdissatisfaction.   I don&apos;t of course venture to express an opinon as to the reliability of these views.   I am not competent to do so.I have been studying the Seoret Service records now for more than ayear, and I am satisfied that a drastic change is required.   i know that the Director of Secret Service on the civilian sideentirely agrees with me, and I have.reason to believe that thelate D.N.I. Agreed with me.                                                    I have
    Q    I have of course not conferred with the present D.N.I.because it would not be desirable for me to do so at this stage,having only recently come to the Admiralty, and the views I amexpressing must be taken as those formed before I camehere, andwhen I was in a position to Judge as an outsiderof the effect and working of the present system as a whole.         To sum up, I would leave existing Departments with theirown Secret Service machinery, and of course their own control and power of action, but I would put the civilian system under a manlike the present Director of Secret Service, responsible to a minister, preferably one without portfolio and therefore notexposed to the charge of interfering with other Departments, whowould be charged with the duty of receiving these reports as soonas they are made, and taking such action or directing such actionto be taken as seems to be necessary.         I am no alarmist, and no pessimist, but I firmly believethat the elements of unrest, and what we call Bolshevism are more general, more deep-seated, than many of us believe, and that ifwe want &apos; o avoid the same kind of trouble which has arisen Inother countries wo must not be content merely to demobilise, toprovide employment for the discharged men etc. , but we must bevigilant, .and above all, we must have an efficient, well-paidSecret Service on the civil side under and responsible to a minister who can bring the facts to the notice of the Cabinet asthey arise, and can act.         I have purposely made this Memorandum vague andindefinite because my object is not so much to offer preciserecommendations as to provide a basis for discussion in theCabinet.
