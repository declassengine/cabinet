Colonel W.Dally Jones.1 OOgggjjT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAUHIC MAJEST YT S GOVERNMEI^SECRET.WAR&apos; 0 A. B I g g T,    EI.1PL0YI/.SNT OF S&amp;IY ALIENS III BRITISH INDUSTRY.\ rM       memorandum by Sir Stephenson Kent,     The question of the further employment of prisoners ofwar, interned enemy aliens and  enemy aliens who have not been interned, requires a ruling.   Dealing first with the prisonersof war, the facts are that a certain number of German prisonersare still employed in industry and demands for further prisonerscome in from time to time.   The policy I propose is that nofurther German prisoners should be placed out on such work andthat ia respect of prisoners still remaining at work the divisional Councils1 of the Local Advisory Committees, should beasked for recommendations as to whether they should, be retained.     The bull;: of employed prisoners, however, are at present engaged&quot;either upon agriculture or timber work.  It is understoodthat the doard of Agriculture do not propose to ask for furtherallocations of prisoner labour but they desire, for some time atany rate, to keep the prisoner labour which they already have.     As regards timber work, the Timber Controller expects at anearly date to lose some 11,000 imported workmen, and there isvery little or no prospect of suitable labour being immediately available in sufficient numbers for purposes of replacement.The timber industry will therefore certainly at best wish toretain the prisoners already allocated to it.     It appears clearly desirable in the national interests toretain German prisoners both on agricultural and timber work,and it might even be necessary to add to their numbers untilthe necessary British labour is available.     On  the other hand, it must be anticipated that theemployment of prisoner labour at a time when unemployment is general may lead to a considerable amount of hostile criticismboth in the House and in the Press.     &quot;With regard to the interned alien, so far as he is an industrial worker, I would suggest that the  same principlesgovern his employment as that oi the German  prisoner.   In sofar as he is either an employer or the proprietor of a one-man business, the matte:, seems rather one  of generalpolicy  than one affecting my Department.  It is, however,submitted for ruling.(Signed)    STEPHENSON KENT,white hall  Gardens,  S.V/,   4th  January,  1919,
