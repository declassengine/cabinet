fThiB Document is the Property of His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government!MSSS&apos;   I &quot;7                JAR CABIHiST.G.T.6649.  &quot;            &quot;Government Purchase of 1919 Flax Crop.&quot;  iiemorandum by tho President of the Board gf Agriculture and Fisheries.          I wish td support Mr. Shortt*s proposal (as contained inG.T.6570) whioh I presume would be extended to the British crop.          At the requeat of the Flax Control Board the Beard ofAgriculture grow some 12,500 acres of flax in Great Britain last year,and have made arrangements for the erection of factories for deseedingthis crop and converting it into fibre.   These arrangements involveheavy commitments at war prices.   We have also at the request of theBoard of Trade and other Departments arranged for a crop in 1919, andhave made offers to growers at .1:16 per ton of flax straw, a prisegoverned by the probable high prices of other crops in 1919 and %tlabour,          Our experience of manufacturing costs is not enough as yet to allow us to express an opinion on the question of the average priceof scutched flax, to which  16 per ton of flax straw is equivalent;but it is certain that any considerable fall in the price cf fibflewould involve, the Government directly in clause on the British crop grown and manufactured by the Government itself - as it would be producedunder war conditions and sold  at peace prices.   Any loss which theGovernment might incur on buying the 1919 crop at the price suggestedby kr, Shortt would therefore  be offset prt tantft by avoiding loss onthe British crop.          Further, I imagine that no tine can speak with any certainty of the probable course of the1  world-price for fibre during the  nextyear or  two.    If the world prioe remains above s&amp;40 per ton, purchaseat the figure suggested by Mr. Shortt would mean no less, but a gain.                                              B.  B.
