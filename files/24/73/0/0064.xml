Obis.  ^^H-t    ,9            I-emorandum on V/ircleas Censorship.           227                 ,&quot;&apos;          In accordance with the decision of the WarCabinet recorded &quot;act paragraph 4;of-the Minutes ofthe meeting on Friday January 10th,  1919, a conference was held on January 15th at the Var Office, at which theForeign Office, the Home Office, the Admiralty, the PostMaster General and the Press Bureau &quot;were represented.          Censorship of incoming wireless pre ;s natterdoes not require re-estabVishment becaune it exists as heretofore.          Censor-ship of outgoing? wireless also exists,with the exception of wireless sent out by GovernmentDepartments, e.g., wireless messages from the ministryof Information.   The messages referring to mesopotamia and to Russia which were brought to the notice of tho WarCabinet on the 10th January had already betm ^iven officiallyto the press and were merely forwarded by the ministry ofInformation,   In order to avoid the recurrence of thotransmission of  such messages overseas it is merelynecessary to inform all Government Departments that all such wireless messages must be submitted to the ^ressBureau, and to inf rm the ^ress Bureau that all messagesreferring t  (a) overseas theatres cf war, and (b) thedemobilization question sh:.uld be referred to the War Officebefore transmission..   This it is proposed to do.          At ths same-time it is necessary to point out  that neither this nor any other form of wireless censorship will prevent any  information which appears  in the British  ressfrom  reaching Russia or Mesopotamia by wireless the onlydifference will bo that instead of information reaching^u-isia in the  course of a  few hours, it will reach there inthe course  of a  few days,  indeed as  .,oon as the BritishPreoa  appear.t  in neutral countries  from which tho new--, canbe wirelessed  or cablsd.General Btuff,  tfur Office.January nth,  1919-.
