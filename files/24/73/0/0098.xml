 Circulated on behalf of the Secretary of State for India, SECRET.libb^jfrjl                                        British Delegation, Paris, ..............,                                                   22nd January 19.19./ALL I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a draft bill to amend the Government  of:&apos;iirdia Act, which Las been  prepared, at tho Prime Ministers direction.  The  bill  is designed, to carry out  the Montagu-Chelmsforcl  Scheme of  Indian  Reform.   It  is accompanied by draftsmen&apos;s notes on clauses.     T would call my colleague&apos;^ attention to the  form of bill.  In  1915 the Govern- ment of  India Acts were  consolidated with  infinite  labour  by a  joint committee  of both Houses.   Such  amendments as Parliament  may now make  in  the. Indian constitution it is suggested should be automatically included in the Consolidated  Act. This device seems to me an admirable one which I hope it  will be found possible  to adopt,  in order to avoid a new complication  of  Statutes, and, it seems to me, affords an admirable example which could be applied in other matters for the simplification of our Statute Book.     Let  me hasten to add that this bill  was  not drafted in  order to suggest  to the Cabinet that it should  &quot;swallow whole,&quot; and without  amendment, the proposals of the Montagu-chelmsford Report, which were published for criticism,   It was drafted as a basis for discussion, as  a more convenient  method  of  deliberation than  in the Report itself.  I have had sitting ever since  last summer an informal  committee  at the India Office, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Charles Roberts, which has drafted the bill,  written and sent to me valuable notes on various aspects of the problem, and is now engaged on preparing for the Cabinet criticisms  which have been received and observations (hereupon.  I would ask  now that these notes, the bill and the criticisms upon the scheme, should  be  referred to  a  Cabinet  Committee with instructions  to commend to the Cabinet a bill to be laid before Parliament as a Government measure. The preparation of this measure must take some time, and  much preliminary work has to be  done before the Committee  will be ready  to receive  the  reports of the Committees on the Franchise, Division of Functions, and the India Office,  which are now sitting.  But I do not propose to ask assent to the introduction of a bill before these Committees have reported to us.      I would remind the Cabinet that  we are pledged, after the second  reading of the bill, to refer to it a Select Committee of both Houses,  so that I do not anticipate a  large draft on the time of the whole of either House.

Confidential.          Government  of India  Bill.                  NOTES  ON CLAUSES.                        General Note.    This  Bill  is intended  to  give-  effect  without substantial modification to the recommendations of the Montagu-ChelmsfordBeport.  Attention is drawn in these notes to the cases whereany departure  in detail has  been made from those recommenda-tions, or where those recommendations have been amplified.    The Bill is drawn in  a form for which there is not  any exactprecedent.   The difficulty in the way of framing  a  Bill to carryout the proposals of the Eeport is the existence of the Governmentof India Act, 1915-16, a  careful and recent measure  of  consolida-tion containing a &quot; printing  clause &quot; which contemplates that all future amending legislation will take the form of definite omissionsfrom, additions to, and substitutions in, the main Act.    It would be possible to  draft a Bill carrying  out the present proposals in  this technical form, as  was done in  the  com-paratively unimportant Bill  of  1916,  but such a Bill  would beon  the face  of  it  incomprehensible,  and would  be  a very unsatisfactory medium for presenting an  important measure - of reform.  On the other hand it  is desirable,  if  possible, that thelaw relating to the Government of India should still be containedin a single statute, and, the  method has accordingly  been adoptedof embodying  the proposals of the  report in the clauses  of aBill, to which  clauses attention will be  principally directed  inParliament, and  adding  a  schedule  making  such &quot;technical&quot;amendments of the  Act of  1915 as  appear to be  consequentialon  the body of the  Bill.     If the  Bill passes in this  form,  the  Act which will govern the constitution in India will still be the Act of 1915 as amended,and the present Bill will lapse  into obscurity.     The possibility has  been  suggested of repealing  the Act of1915 altogether and substituting a new Act drawn on the same lines as the Acts which govern the constitution  of the  self-governing dominions.  It is  thought  that  the  time  has not come when  such a  course  is possible,  and that  the objections  areinsuperable.     6-3                     A
    There  is in the first  place the  parliamentary objection.   ABill in this form would  expose  to  criticism  in Parliament thewhole machinery of the Government of India from top to bottom,including many points which, though controversial, are not put  in issue  by the proposed reforms.    In  the second place  it would  be misleading to  representthe new proposals, far reaching  as they are,  as amounting  tothe substitution of a new structure for  the  old structure.  Thecontrol  of  the Secretary of  State and  of the  Governor-general in Council,  though  qualified  in  some  directions,  remains  inmany important respects  (for  the present)  unimpaired.  So farat all events as the Government  of  India is concerned there  isno real  approach  to  the  Dominions system  of  a constitutionalGovernor with.  Ministers  responsible  to an elected  legislature.As  Sir   C.  Ilbert lias pointed  out,  the new  proposals  makeimportant breaches, and will enable  further  breaches to be madein the future,  in  the defences  of  the  bureacratic  system, butthey  do not amount to,  and  cannot  properly in  a legislativedocument be represented as amounting to,  an immediate grantof responsible government.    The Bill is of course merely an  outline, and many of themost  important  proposals will  be  carried  out  by means  of regulations  made  under  the Bill.  It may  be possible to deal more  precisely  in  the Bill  itself with some of these proposalswhen the Committees on &quot; Franchises &quot; and on &quot; Eunctions &quot; havemade their reports, but whatever  the reports of those committeesmay be it will certainly  be impossible  to  avoid  leaving  many important objects to be attained by  means of regulations.   Whatis contemplated  is   of   course   a  gradual  extension of theprinciple of  reform, and   it would  be impossible to effect thissatisfactorily if it were necessary to  come   back  to  Parliamentwhenever some  further extension was  contemplated or wheneverany experiment had proved unsuccessful or premature.   It has beena common practice in legislating  as to the government of Indiato leave important matters to be  dealt with  by regulations, andthis was notably the  case  in the  Act of  1909,  where  practicallythe whole  of the constitution and method of selection of  membersof the new councils were left to regulations.                           Preamble.    The preamble is intended  to  be  a  brief  statement of thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as announced by the Secre-
tary of State for India on August 20th, 1917,  and of the broadintentions  underlying the Report.    A more  elaborate  form  of  preamble has  been  suggestedafter consultation with Lord Haldane, as an alternative expositionof the constitutional  changes aimed at, which runs as  follows:     &quot; Whereas it  is necessary with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India  as  an integral  part of the BritishEmpire  gradually to  develop   self-governing   institutions   in  thatcountry:    &quot; And  whereas with  this aim  in  view it  is  expedient  to make provision to such extent  as hereinafter  appears  for the establishmentof a system of autonomy in the provinces of India,  the  governmentsthereof deriving their authority directly from the Imperial Parliament:    &quot;And  whereas it  is nevertheless  necessary, whilst providing forsuch modification of  the powers of control now vested in the Governor-General of  India as  must  result  from  the foregoing proposals,  to reserve  to  the Governor-General  such  powers  as  are  required forthe representation of His Majesty to be  exercised  under  the directionof His Majesty and of  Parliament:    &quot; Be &quot;it therefore enacted, &amp;c.&quot;     In conjunction with this alternative  preamble, a clause  inthe following form was also  suggested:      &quot; (1)  With  a  view to  establishing,  subject  to  the  con-ditions hereinafter appearing, such  a  system of autonomy  inthe provinces of India  as aforesaid, the consent of the Governor-General to Acts passed  by a  governors  legislative council,  andthe previous sanction of the  Governor-General to the repeal oralteration, by a  governor^ legislative council,  of Acts passed byother authorities in British India shall no longer be  necessary.     &quot;  (2)  If  the governor  of  a  province assents to  any  Actpassed  by his  legislative  council he shall forthwith  send anauthentic  copy to the  [Governor-General  and the] Secretary  ofState,  and it shall be lawful  for  His Majesty  to signify throughthe Secretary of State  in  Council his disallowance of any  suchAct.     &quot; (3)  Where the disallowance of  any such Act has been  sosignified, the  governor shall forthwith  notify the disallowance,and thereupon the Act from  the date of  the notification  shall become void accordingly.&quot;
     As this preamble and clause  represent a  substantial modi- fication of the proposals contained in  the Eeport, they have been excluded  from the Bill in its present  stage in  pursuance of the policy stated at  the beginning of these notes.     It will  be for consideration        (1) whether  the proposal  in the clause  is  to  be adopted              that Bills passed hy the provincial legislatures  shall              go  straight to the King for assent, or whether they              shall continue  to go, as  now, to  the  Governor-              General;  and       (2)  whether,  if  the clause is not included,  the proposed              preamble  could be  fairly  said to lead  up to  the              proposals contained  in the Bill.     A very  drastic power is conferred by  clause 19  of the bill of modifying  the  powers  of  control exercised by the  Governor-General in Council, and this power could  be extended so as toenable the proposal in  Lord Haldane&apos;s clause to be carried intoeffect by  rule.  It is  understood,  however, that the  supporters of the clause attach considerable importance to its being includedin express terms in a prominent  place in  the Bill.  No definite decision as  to  this  point  is  possible  pending receipt of  the report  of the Functions Committee.                           Clause  1.     This clause will enable regulations to be made  giving effectto the recommendations in the  Eeport  (as expanded  by  therecommendations of the Functions  Committee) as to      (1) the  subjects which  are  to be  left  to the  control  of           provincial governments; and     (2) the subjects  which are to  be  handed  over for adminis-           tration by ministers; and     (3) the revision of the financial relations between the Govern-           ment  of India  and the provinces.     The  terms   of  reference to  the  Functions Committee areprinted as Appendix A. to these notes.     The report (in paragraph 212) contemplates either-       (a) a statutory demarcation  of powers such as is found in             some  federal constitutions; or
       (b) leaving  it to be settled  as a matter of  constitutional              practice that the central Government will not inter-              fere  with  provincial matters  unless the interests              for which it is responsible are directly affected.     The  Reforms  committee, after much consideration and after consultation with  Lord  Haldane, have  come  to  the conclusion that  the  latter method is the more satisfactory.     The  objection  to  leaving  important  measures  to  be  dealt with by  regulation arises with special  acuteness  in connection with this  clause, and may  give  rise  to  considerable criticism in Parliament.   At the same time it is  thought that whatever may be the  recommendations  of  the Functions Committee it  will not be possible to set out  a  list of subjects in  the Bill.  The idea, of course, is  that  certain subjects  will be handed over imme- diately, but  the degree  of  autonomy will vary in the different provinces, and in each province from time to  time, and the only practical  way  to effect this  is by administrative regulations.     The regulations will, by virtue of clause 25, he made by the Governor-General in Council with the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council, and  that clause  provides for  the regulations being laid  before  both  Houses  of  Parliament.  The authority of Parliament over  the subject matter of the regulations  will be to this  extent safeguarded.     Provision  will  be  made under paragraph  (b) of this clause for  carrying  out the  recommendation  in the  Report  that  the competence of the Government of  India to  legislate on  subjects for which they are responsible  shall not  be open to challenge in the courts.     In  connection with  the  proposed revision of  financial  rela- tions a  point which may  have  to be considered is whether any modification  is required   of  s.  79 (3) (a) of the  principal Act, under which local  legislatures  are  prohibited from passing laws which affect  (amongst other things) customs and other duties for the time being in  force   and imposed  by the  authority  of  the Governor-General in Council for  the  purpose of the Government of India.    In  connection  with   the  administrative devolution  it  may also have  to  be considered whether any modifications are required of  the  other  paragraphs of  s. 79 (3), and  in particular  para-graph (e), which relates  to laws  affecting religion or religiousrights and usages of any  class  of  British subjects in India,
                           Clause 2.    This  clause and  the following  clause  make  the  necessary-provision  as to the new constitution  of  the  local governmentin the  eight provinces,  and  provide, as recommended  by the report , for  the division  of the  government  of  those provincesinto two  separate  branches, namely, the Governor in  Council,and  the Governor  and Ministers.    The  administration of  the  five provinces which  will forthe first time be placed under  a  governor  is  assimilated in all respects to that of the three presidencies, but  in order to give effectto the  recommendation of  the  Eeport in  paragraph  218,  that&quot;the  common designation  of  Governor would  not  imply  any&quot; equality of emoluments or status,&quot; the use of the word &quot; presi-dency&quot; has  been  retained  in referring to Bombay, Madras,  andBengal,  and it is  provided in a subsequent  place  in the  Bill(see Schedule ad fin) that the salaries of the new governors  willbe  the same as that  of  the  existing lieutenant-governors  and chief  commissioners in the  same provinces.  It is presumed  that provision  will  also he made in  the usual  way,  i.e., by EoyalWarrant,  that  the precedence of  the various heads of the eightprovinces will remain  unaltered.   It will he observed, however,that one effect of the clause is that whereas the existing lieutenant-governors  are appointed   by  the  Governor-General  with  theapproval of His Majesty, and chief commissioners  hy the Gover-nor-General, the new  governors will he appointed by His Majestyby royal warrant.    A  point  as  to which  controversy has  arisen  is whether  itis  desirable to define&apos; with, exactitude, and, if  so, in what terms,the relations  between the  Governor  and  his Ministers.   Theprincipal  Act (in   sections  49  and  50)  defines  in some detail the relations  between the  Governor  and  the  members of his executive  Council.  These  sections  will continue  in  force,  andthe  opinion  has   been  strongly  expressed  by   persons  with experience of government in India  that it is necessary, wherever possible, to be able to justify  any  course  of action  taken hyspecific provisions  hi  the  governing  statute.    On   the  otherhand,  it has been  pointed  out  with much force that  in dealingwith  a form of government, which will ex  hypothesi he  in  astate  of progressive growth, it is undesirable to he too precise.
      Expression  has  been  given  to  the  latter  view in  the following  extract from  a note by Sir Courtenay Ilbert:      &quot; The attempt to embody a  constitution in  a statute is always dangerous, but for India the stage has not yet been  reached  at which such  an  attempt  could be  made.  India  is  contemplated  by  the framers of  the  Montagu-Chelmsford Report as being in a state of transition, and destined  to go through a  process of development.  But a  process cannot  be  expressed  in  statutory language. What is  most  necessary  at  the present  stage  is  the  clearing away of  legal obstacles  in  the way of development, and this a statute can and must do.  But when such a statute attempts  to do more than  this, it  should  use very  general language  lest it hamper and  impede the progress which, whatever statutes may say,  will follow its  natural course.  *    *    *    *    *  The  difficulty  of expressing with precision the  delicate relations between  a governor and  his ministers, and the dangers of any attempt  to do so lead me  to the  conclusion that the balance of arguments is against making any such  attempt in the  Bill. Much may be  done to  help a  governor in  his difficult task by  instructions, formal or  informal,  private or published,  but  his success or failure  must depend mainly on his  own  tact and  judgment.  An  attempt  to  strengthen his position by statute, would, I feel confident, do more harm than good.&quot;     Whichever  of  the above views is  adopted it is necessary in this  clause  to adopt  some phrase to  describe  that part of  the local government which  consists of the governor  and ministers. The  usual  phrase  in statutes establishing  responsible government is &quot; the Governor acting with  the  advice of  his Ministers,&quot; but the  Reforms Committee incline  to  the view that it  is desirable to emphasise by some  divergence of phrase  the fact  that it  is not  proposed  immediately  to  establish  a  full  system of re- sponsible   government.   Whatever  phrase   is   used,   the   fact that  the ministers  are members  of the  legislature  will, in  the natural  course   of  events, lead  in time  to  responsible  govern- ment, in the sense that nothing can prevent ministers, however their  functions  are  described, from  discussing  policy with  one another and  arriving at independent decisions,  and  refusing to continue in  office  if those  decisions  are not  accepted by the governor.  As,  however, no  such  state of things is  anticipated for the present,  it has been thought  advisable to use the phrase in  the Bill, namely,  &quot; the  Governor  acting  after  consultation with his  Ministers&quot; : the  phrase &quot;the  Governor acting with  the assistance  of his  Ministers&quot; has   also  been  suggested, though even this expression  might  be thought  to  point too directly to a system of full responsibility.     The  Bill,  however,  contains  at  present  a further  proposal in  clause  3  (3), providing in terms that the governor  has  anunrestricted  right of overriding  the  views of  his ministers,  and
the real  question  is  whether  this  provision should he  retained in the Bill.  The  right of  a governor to  override the views ofhis ministers unquestionably exists in theory, even  in the  mostcomplete system of  responsible  government, but  the  extent towhich  the  right is or can in practice be exercised depends uponusage, and upon the stage of political development which has beenreached.  The Reforms Committee are inclined (though not unani-mously) to doubt whether the inclusion of  this provision would beeffectual for the purpose  of enabling the views of ministers to beset aside,  and it  is   thought that a time may  come when the disadvantage of having in  a statute a provision  which is onlytheoretically  operative, and which might be injudiciously used byan indiscreet governor, will be found to outweigh  the advantageof providing  the  governor, when the new  system  starts,  withchapter and verse  for asserting his point of view.    The difficulty of expressing accurately the  character of the reformed  local  government  is  accentuated when  one has toconsider  the  form  in which orders  and proceedings of the localgovernment  are to  be  expressed.   The  technical  expressionhitherto  employed  for an  order of a local  government, when that government consists of  a governor and an executive council,is an &quot;order of the   Governor in Council.&quot;  This expression  isno  longer  appropriate in  the  case of  an order  relating  to  atransferred subject;  and  its  continued  use  with  reference toan order relating to  a reserved  subject and  without explanationwould imply that  such an order is different in character from anorder relating to a transferred subject, whereas it is the intentionof the scheme  embodied  in the  Report  that every  order passedby the governor, whether on his own responsibility,  or in. agree-ment with  his council, or in agreement with his  ministers, shouldbe alike an order  of  the local government.    It is  proposed  in the  Bill  to  get over this  difficulty by providing  that all such  orders  as aforesaid are to be  officiallydescribed as  &quot;orders  of  the government  of the  province.&quot;   Thisis effected  by an amendment  (in  the Schedule) of  s. 49  of theprincipal Act.    No attempt has  been made to define in the Bill the relations which are  to exist between  the  two parts  of  the  Government the  Executive Council on  the  one  hand,  and  the minister  or ministers on the other.   The reason for  this  omission is  thatthis matter is essentially  one for settlement by practice,  and thatas the Report  contemplates  united  action so far  as possible by
 both  parts, the  difficulties which would arise  out  of  any  such attempted definition would he  even greater than those arising in the case of the relations between the governor and the ministers.                              Clause 8.     Subsection  (1). The   expressions   &quot;official&quot;  and  &quot;non- official&quot; are defined  by clause 27.     The recommendation of the Report is definitely to the effect that elected members only  should be qualified for appointment as  ministers.&apos;*&apos;  It  is, however,  expressly  contemplated  in  the, instructions to  the Franchise  Committee (which are  set  out as Appendix B.  to these Notes),  that nomination may he  resorted to for  the purpose of the representation of special and minority interests,  and the Reforms Committee anticipate that  much pro- test may  arise if representatives  of those interests are definitely excluded from the right to he appointed as ministers.     Possibly therefore in  this subsection  &quot; non-official&quot;  should be substituted  for &quot;elected.&quot;     Subsection (2). This subsection gives effect  to the  proposal that the  tenure of office of a minister is to he  conditional  on his  retention of his seat.   It has, however,  been provided  that a minister may continue in  office  for three months after vacating his seat, in  order to avoid  the  inconvenience which might other- wise be caused by  the  automatic  vacation of  all ministerial appointments at the time  of a general election.     Subsection (3). The  question as  to whether  a provision  to this effect should  be inserted  in  the  Bill  has  already been discussed in the  note  on clause 2.   It may he pointed out  that the  words,  &quot;hut  in  any  such,  case^  &amp;c,&quot;  are  adopted  from the  forms of  instructions  issued  in  various cases to  colonial governors.     Subsection  (4). In this subsection  effect  is  given  to  the proposals  in  paragraph  220 of  the  report  that the governor &quot; should appoint if he chooses one or two additional members &quot;  of his government,  acting as  members without  portfolio for    * See especially the following passage  in paragraph 222 of  the Report: &quot; By&quot; the device, however, of appointing the ministers from  the elected members  of &quot; the legislative council and making  their  tenure of office conditional  on the&quot; retention of their seats we have established at once some measure of responsi-&quot; bility, in the form of responsibility to their constituents, and hare thus put an&quot; end to the condition of affairs  in which those entrusted  with the administration&quot; are wholly irresponsible to the constituents who eleot the legislative council.&quot;    6                           IS
(   io  )&quot; the purpose  of  consultation and  advice.&quot;   What the  exactstatus  of those persons is to be  is not  quite  clear,  but  theEeforms Committee incline to  the view that it  would be more accurate to describe  them as  &quot; attached  to&quot; the  governmentthan as members of the  government, especially  in view  of  the dual  character which it is  proposed   to  give  to   the localgovernment.    No express provision is  made  for carrying out the proposal in  paragraph  224  of  the Report  as  to  the  appointment of under-secretaries.   This can  be done without further  statutorypower.                          Clause  4.    This clause gives effect to the recommendations of the  report with respect to the  constitution of a governors executive council(see paragraph 218).   The subject is dealt with at present so faras governors are  concerned by section 47, and so far as lieutenantgovernors are concerned by section 55 of the principal Act.    Section 47 provides that an  executive council shall consist ofsuch number not exceeding four as may be directed, that at least two of these four must be persons with twelve years&apos; service underthe Crown in India, and that  if the Commander-in-Chief of theForces in  India  is resident in Calcutta,  Madras, or Bombay, he shall, during his residence there, be a member of the executivecouncil.    The Report proposes that a governors executive council shallconsist of two members, and that in  practice  one of them  shouldbe  a person of official experience.    The Reforms Committee have not considered it  necessary toreduce  the present maximum  of four members,  and to provideexpressly that the council shall in future consist of two members,as it will be open to the Government to carry out these  proposalswithout an alteration of the law, and  it is  thought that it might atsome future date prove convenient if some some slight margin of expansion  were available.  If, however, the number of  membersof  the executive council is  either by law or by practice to bereduced  to two,  it seems necessarily to  follow  that the present statutory qualifications (including  the above-mentioned  provision as  to the  Commander-in-Chief) should cease to  have effect,  andthis clause provides accordingly.    Provision  is made in the Schedule  for  the necessary con-sequential  amendments of section  47.
                           Clause 5.    This  clause  deals  with  the composition  of local legisla-tures   under  the proposed  scheme.   The  clause must dependfor its form  to some extent on  the  recommendations of  the franchise Committee,  and in  particular, the precise  number tobe fixed as  the  maximum number of members in the  case  ofvarious councils  must be  left for  decision  till that  Committeehas reported.    Subsection (2) provides by direct enactment that  a majority on a governors council is to consist of  elected  members, but theremaining recommendations  of the  report as to the  composition of local councils will be left to rules.    It will be noticed that  the  Report  does  not contemplate that  the Act will  in any event  make  provision in detail asto the  composition of the councils, but proposes that the  corn-position  of  the  councils should  be  determined by the Secretaryof  State  in Council,  on  the recommendation of  the  Govern-ment  of  India,  in the  form  of regulations  to be  laid beforeParliament, and expresses  the opinion that  this is  certainly abetter method  than  to formulate  such  matters in  the statuteitself.   (See paragraph 225.)    This proposal is  carried out in the spirit  by subsection  (2)of this clause, but the  terms  of clause 25 which will govern  rulesunder   this  subsection  make  a slight  change  in  machinery,inasmuch as - the regulations  will  he  framed  by the Governor-General  in  Council, with the  sanction  of  the Secretary of  state in Council.    Subsection (2). The  Eeport recommends (in paragraph 225)that a &quot;substantial majority&quot; of the members of every  council shall  be elected, and it will probably be thought right to make this proposal statutory.  Until, however, the Franchise  Committeehas  reported, it  cannot be  settled what precisely is to be theproportion of elected members in the various councils.    The Eeport recommends that &quot; the system of indirect electionshould be swept away&quot; (see paragraph 226).  This, again, should probably  be made  statutory,  as  is  done by this subsection,, butdecision on this question of policy  must await the  recommenda-tions  of  the Franchise Committee.     Subsection   (3). This  carries   out the  recommendation inparagraph 254 of the Eeport.       6                      B 2
                           Clause 6.     This clause deals with  the  procedure  and  powers  of  the newly constituted local  legislatures.     Subsection (1). This subsection is  not  based on any definiterecommendation in  the  Eeport, hut it seemed  to  the EeformsCommittee  that the  position as  defined  by section 80  of  theprincipal Act was hardly consistent with the character which  itis intended to give  to the new legislative  bodies.  The position at  present is  that  the  Councils are debarred  by  law fromhandling anything but legislative  business and rules of procedure,and can only acquire  the right of dealing with  other matters hyrules made  hy  the  executive  government.   In other  words,unless a  power is  definitely  conferred, either hy the Act or byrules, the  presumption  is that the council  has not that  power.Under  the new proposals  the presumption will be that  everycouncil  has  full power  to  discharge  all the  functions  whichproperly  belong to  a  legislative  assembly.   The   subsection,however (in accordance with  the  latter  part  of  paragraph 236 ofthe Eeport),  provides for a  discretionary  power  of  limitationso  far  as questions  and the  discussion  of matters  of  public importance are  concerned.    It  will  be observed that  subsection  (2) of  section 80  willremain  intact, whilst  subsections (1)  and (3),  although repealedand replaced by the proposals of  this  clause so  far as governors&apos;councils are concerned, will remain in force  as  applicable to  the council&apos;s of lieutenant-governors - and  chief  commissioners..   Ifthe recommendations  of  the  Eeport  are carried out,  the onlyprovince to which, the provisions of  section 80  in  its unalteredform  will apply will be the province of Burma.    In  order to give coherence to the provisions of the  principalAct in  its amended  form,  the  schedule to  the Bill provides(a) for the retention of subsections (1) and (3) of section 80 as  a section  applying only  to councils  other than governors&apos; councils,(b) for   the  insertion  of  a  new section (similar in  effect tothis  clause)  dealing  with  governors&apos;  councils,  and (c) for  thereproduction  of  subsection (2) of  section 80  as a  new  sectionapplicable both to governors&apos; councils and to other councils.     Subsection  (2). Paragraph  (a) of this  subsection  enableseffect to be  given  to paragraphs  255 and 256  of  the Eeport,but the latter part  of the paragraph, beginning with the  words&quot;and in  any case&quot; is an amplification of  the  recommendations
contained in those paragraphs which the Reforms  Committee, ona  close  examination  of the  Report,  feels  sure   is  a  correctinterpretation of the intention of the  framers.  The object ofthe addition is to meet circumstances which might arise in whichthe  Council,  by way  of protest  against the  exercise  of  the governors powers of insisting on an allotment for reserved subjects,might decline to vote any allotment  for  transferred subjects andso  produce a deadlock.   In  such circumstances  the governor should clearly have  such  power as the addition to  the paragraphprovides.     Paragraphs (b)  and (c)  give  effect  to  the proposals of para-graphs  252  and 254  as to the  passing of  laws  by means ofGrand Committees,  but go beyond those proposals.  The Reportproposes that the Governor  should be empowered     (i) to &quot;certify&quot; a Government  Bill on  a reserved  subject           as being essential,  and so to secure  that  it shall be           passed by being subjected to the  nominated majority           in a Grand Committee (paragraph 252);     (ii)  to  certify   a  non-official  member&apos;s  Bill or  amendment           dealing  with a transferred subject as trenching  upon           the reserved field,  and having so certified it              (a) to decline  to allow it  to  be discussed,  or              (b) to suggest  to the Council an amended  Bill, or              (c) (if the  Council  so desire) to refer the original           Bill to a Grand Committee  (paragraph  254).     Point (i) of these  proposals is carried out without  modifi-cation in paragraph (b) of this subsection.   But in paragraph (c)the  proposals of the Report have been  modified so as to enablethe  Governor to refuse  assent to  the  introduction of any  Bill,whatever its subject matter, and,  further,  to refer to a GrandCommittee  any Bill, whatever its subject matter, on his  own initiative and not subject to the  request of the Council, and atany stage  of its progress  and  not only at  the initial stage.After  careful  consideration,  the  Reforms  Committee  are ofopinion that without these modifications of the proposals in theReport the  safeguards for the due discharge of the  Governor^responsibilities which  the Grand Committee procedure is intendedto provide will be  inadequate, and that what may be described as the  negative form  of certification  and the power to with-hold  assent  to introduction  proposed  in  paragraph 254 of theReport must  be free from the limitations  proposed in the  sameparagraph.
(  H  ) :   The phrase &quot; safety, tranquillity  or  interests  of the province,&amp;c.&quot;  in  this  subsection  has been adopted from section  50 (2)of the Act, in preference to the phrase tentatively suggested asthe ground for certification  in  paragraph  252  of  the Report;the phrase  has, however, been  extended by  a reference  to the safety, &amp;c, of a neighbouring province.    Subsection (3) is intended to enable effect  to  be given tothe proposal in paragraph 236 of the Report that the new pro-vincial legislature should have power to  modify their own  rules of procedure with  the sanction  of the Governor in  accordancewith  the procedure laid down in section  83 (2) of the principalAct.   This  subsection is, however, so worded as to leave it clearthat rules made under  this clause, so far as they are  really partof the provincial constitution and not matters of formal procedure,will remain subject  to  the consent  of  the  Secretary  of State inCouncil  and to being laid before Parliament  in accordance withclause 25 of the Bill.    This clause, has been  drafted in alternative forms, and thesecond alternative  represents an  endeavour to avoid  the appear-ance  of  dealing with the vital matters  covered by the clause bydepartmental  rules.  The second alternative sets out  in the formof direct enactment  the leading  principles  under which the pro-cedure of the  councils is to  be  carried on, and leaves the detains to  be  worked  out  by rules.  Prom the parliamentary point ofview  it  is  perhaps  open  to  question  whether  these principles,when  plainly and boldly enunciated, will not excite  as much ormore  opposition in  the  House  as  the  first alternative  underwhich these matters are dealt with  by rules.                           Clause 7.     This clause  gives effect without  modification to the proposalat the end of paragraph 254 of the Report.  If, however, the new clause  quoted above, which has been suggested by Lord Haldane,is adopted, subsection- (2) of  this clause will need reconsideration.                            Clause 8.     This clause is  not based on any definite recommendation  ofthe Report, but  the provisions of section  74 (2) of the principalAct,  as to the  vacation  of seats  in  the provincial legislative councils, are not very  clear,  and the proposals for the reconstitu-tion  of these  councils are, in the view of the Reforms Committee,such as to make it  desirable that  the subject  should be placedon a  sound footing.
    As  respects nominated members, the existing law appears tobe  that  an official  nominated  member vacates his  seat  if  heaccepts  an office under  the  Crown other than that which he heldwhen he  was nominated, and  a non-official vacates his seat  onany acceptance of  office.  There seems  to  be no point in  main-taining  this provision.  The law being  that a certain  proportionof the nominated members must be non-officials, it is not neces-sary to  provide for the vacation of a seat on the acceptance ofan  office so long as the prescribed balance between official and non-official members is maintained.   Subsection (1) therefore pro-vides  that where the acceptance of an office under the Crown  bya nominated member increases  the number of official  nominated members above  the  prescribed  limit, the  seatj of  that member shall  become vacant.    The case  of elected members presents  more difficulties,  andit may be convenient  in this connection to recall the law on thissubject  in the United  Kingdom  as laid  down by sections  24and 25  of  6 Anne,  c.  41; the correct interpretation of thesesections  is  a matter  of controversy,  but  the following may perhaps be taken as giving their  general effect:     (1)  Any person  who  accepts  an  office  under the  Crown           created  since  1705, is  absolutely  disqualified from           sitting in the House of  Commons,  but in  the case           of  a ministerial appointment  this disqualification  is           invariably  removed  by  statute:    (2)  Any person  who accepts  an   office  under the  Crown           created before 1705, or any  office &quot;from&quot;  the Crown           created after that date  to which disqualification does           not  attach, vacates  his  seat,  but may be re-elected.    Presumably there should be power to reproduce in  India thegeneral   principle  that  a  person who holds   office  under  theCrown  is  disqualified  from   being  an  elected member,  this being founded  on  the  salutary principle that the  Crown ought not to be able to swamp the legislative  body with office holders.In view, however, of the doubtful  character of  the law at home,and the difficulty which might arise in applying it precisely tothe provinces  of India,  it  has  been thought best to leave thematter to be dealt with by rules.    The clause does not at present reproduce  the provision of english law under which it is necessary for a member of  theHouse of Commons to seek re-election if he accepts a ministerial
office.  It will be recalled that there is a considerable body ofopinion at  home  which tends towards the  abolition  of  this pro-vision, and it has been to a considerable  extent suspended  duringthe war.  It  remains, however,  of value as a means of  testingthe hold possessed by the  Government upon the  country.                       i                          Clause 9.    This clause is not based on an express recommendation of the report .  There is power under section 53 (2) of the principal Actto create new lieutenant-governorships,  and under section 59 tocreate new  chief commissionerships, and it seems  to the EeformsCommittee that it is  a logical outcome  of the present  proposals that there should be power without further recourse to Parliamentto extend the number of provinces to which the new principles ofgovernment will  apply.    The Eeport, whilst excluding Burma from the  proposals affecting the eight provinces, says:     &quot; When our  proposals are published there will  be an oppor-         tunity  for the Government and people of Burma to         say how far  they  regard  them as applicable to  their         case.  We therefore set  aside  the problem of Burma&apos;s         political evolution  for  separate and  future  consider-         ation.&quot;    Presumably, if  the time comes when Burma is to be  made aGovernors  province, there should be power to do this without anew Bill.    The Eeforms Committee  also suggest in this clause a provisionenabling part of a  province to be  detached  and  placed underthe head of the  parent province or a lieutenant-governor on his behalf.  Some  such  procedure  seems  to be  contemplated  bythe proposals of the Eeport as  to the  treatment  of backwardtracts (see  paragraph. 199) and  as to  the redistribution of  areas(see paragraph 246).    The  Committee  recognise  that if  resort is  had to  such a process, the  &quot; lieutenant-governor&quot;  to  whose immediate care asub-province  is  committed  would  hold  an  office  different in character from  existing lieutenant-governors, but as all existinglieutenant-governorships with  the exception  Of   Burma  will be abolished if the  proposals of the  Eeport are  carried into effect,they  think  that confusion will not result from the  perpetuationof the term with a  new significance.
(  u  )     It  should be noticed that these  same proposals involve the repeal of  section seventy-seven of the principal  Act as  being no  longer  required in view of the provisions  of this clause.                       Clauses  10 to  12.     These  clauses  carry  out  the proposals of the Report as tothe  constitution of the new Indian Legislature.     The Franchise Committee will in time prepare a scheme of electoral procedure,  but whatever that Committee proposes it isthought that their recommendations will have to be carried outby  rules and not by statutory provisions.   This is, of  course, thecase under the law  affecting  the  existing legislature.     As respects the  Council  of  State, it  is  presumed  that therecommendations of  the  Report  as  to the  precise numbers ofnon-elected, non-official,  and elected members are to be  madestatutory  and  not  subject  to  modification by  rule.  This  has accordingly been done in subsection (2) of clause 11.     A  question  arises  as  to  the position  of  the  Governor-General  in  relation  to  the  two   chambers  of the  IndianLegislature.   The   Report   appears  to  contemplate  that  theGovernor-General  is  to  be  a  member of  the Council of  State,as it says  (in   paragraph  277) that  the Council  of  State  &quot;will&quot; be composed of  fifty  members,  exclusive  of  the Governor-&quot; General, who will  be  President.&quot;  As,  however, the  Reportcontinues  by saying  that the  &quot;Governor-General should  have&quot; power to appoint  a Vice-President  who  would  normally take&quot; his place,&quot;  the  intention  may possibly  have  been that  theGovernor-General was only to be present and preside on excep-tional  occasions, and was not to be  regarded as a member ofthe Council in the  ordinary  sense.   If the Governor-General isnot to be a member of the Council of State  in  the strict  sense,some provision will  have to  be  made as to whether or not heis  to have the power of voting.  It  has  been  assumed that where the  Governor-General  is  present and presiding  he will beable not only  to  vote on any  proposed  motion but also in theevent of a tie to give a second or  casting vote, as under thepresent law.     The Report makes no definite  provision as to the  positionof the Governor-General  in  the  legislative  assembly, but from .the proposal in paragraph 275 that the  Governor-General should nominate a member  of  the  assembly  to  be its  president,  the reforms Committee  have  deduced that he will not be a member.At the  same  time they suggest that  it might  be convenient if     6                        C
 power were conferred on  him analogous to  that  possessed  by the  President of the  United States of  attending and addressing any  meeting  of   the  assembly.    The  clause  accordingly  so provides.                                                  f                          &apos; Clause 13.     The  provision in this clause,  that the  statutory term for the  duration  of  the two  chambers may be extended in special circumstances  by  the Governor-General, is  not based  on  the Report,  but  the  Reforms  Committee  suggest it  under  the impression  that  critical  situations  might  arise  in  which  it would be  practically  necessary to  postpone  the holding of  a general election if one fell due.                           Clause 14.     The same considerations  apply to  this  clause  as apply  to clause 8 in relation  to the  provincial  councils.  Subsection (2) gives effect to  the Report (paragraph 277) in providing  that official  members   should  be  eligible for  nomination  in  both chambers  but that a  non-official  can only be a member  of one chamber.                           Clause 15.     Section 63  of the  principal  Act,  which  provides  for  the constitution of the existing  Indian Legislative Council,  will  be replaced by clauses 10  to 15 of  this Bill, and it  is therefore necessary  to  re-enact,  as is  done  by  this section,  certain  of those provisions,  and  to make them applicable  to  the proposed new legislature.     The only  provision  of  this section  which is not re-enacted is  that of subsection (4),  which it  seems clear to the Committee should now disappear  for much  the  same reasons as apply  to the  repeal  of  section  37  (2) see note  on  clause 17,  sub- section (2).     As the number of  members to  be  nominated and  elected in the Council  of  State  is  to  be  specified in  the Bill (see clause 11 (2) ) the legislative  assembly only  is mentioned  in paragraph (a) of subsection  (1).                          Clause 16.     Subsection (1). The  same considerations apply to this sub-section as apply to subsection (1) of clause 6, which deals with local governments on the same lines as  this subsection deals withthe Government of India.
,     Subsection (2).-Paragraphs (a) and (b) enable effect to begiven  to the  recommendations of  the Report  with  respect  tothe  procedure  in the  Indian  Legislature  and  differences  ofopinion  between  the two  Chambers.   (See Eeport, paras.  279,280  and 286.  :     Subsection  (3)  is  inserted  with the  same  object as  sub-section  (3)  of clause  6.   The variation  in  form  from  that subsection is due to  the fact that the Act  does not. as respects the  Government  of  India, confer any  express  power,  such as isconferred by section 83, on provincial governments of originatingrules of  procedure.     As  in  the  case  of  clause  6, an  alternative form for  thisclause is submitted,  under which the  guiding  principles to  be observed  in the  case of  the  differences of  opinion  are directlyenacted, the details to be carried out by rules.                           Clause 17..     This clause  gives effect  to the proposal in  paragraph  271of the Eeport  to &quot;abolish  such statutory restrictions as  now&quot; exist  in  respect  of   the  appointment   of  members  of  the&quot; Governor-General&apos;s  council  so as to give a greater elasticity&quot; in respect of the size of the Government and the distribution&quot; of work.&quot; This appears to  involve  getting rid of the limita-tions imposed  by subsections (2) and (3)  of  section  36 of theprincipal Act.   Following  a  further  suggestion  in the above-quoted paragraph of  the Eeport power is given by the clause  tomake  rules as to the  qualifications to be  required  in respectof members of the executive  council.     Subsection (2). The proposal contained in this  subsection isnot based on any recommendation, of  the  Eeport, but in deter-mining the  composition of the reformed  executive  council  ithas to he considered  whether  the provision of the  existing  lawis to be  maintained that where  the  executive council  sits  in a province  having  a governor  the governor is  to be   an  extra-ordinary  member  of the council.    Under present conditions this provision is  largely  otiose,  asin practice the Governor-GeneraPs executive council never nowsits in a province having a governor.  Under the new  proposals,however, the question becomes  more acute, as the Punjab wouldbecome a governors province, and if the Act is left unchangedthe governor of the Punjab would be ex-officio a member of theGovernor-GeneraPs executive  council when it sits  at Simla.    6                         C 2
     The Reforms Committee take the view that, inasmuch, as itis merely hy accident that in such circumstances the  executivecouncil would he,  sitting  in  the Punjab,  and  inasmuch  as itsdiscussions will relate in general to matters in which the Punjabis not  exclusively  interested,  and frequently  to  matters withwhich, that province has no concern,  it is undesirable to main-tain  the present  state of  the law, and  that section  37  (2)should  be repealed.     Assuming that this is done, it has further been  suggestedthat  it would be possible  to  abolish altogether the  distinctiondrawn  in  sections .35  to  37  of  the  principal  Act  between&quot; ordinary &quot; and &quot; extraordinary &quot; members of the council.  Therewill  only be an extraordinary member of the council if theSecretary of  State in Council  exercises the power conferred on him by  section  37 (1) of  appointing the Commander-in-Chief asan extraordinary  member.   Now that  the  restriction on numbersis to be  removed there will not be any difficulty in  future arisingfrom that  cause in  the  way of appointing the Commander-in-Chief as a member.  Under  the present  practice, although theCommander-in-Chief is strictly appointed as an  extraordinarymember, he is for  practical  purposes  the ordinary member incharge  of the  Army department, and  there  seems little  pointin maintaining the provision  in the Act  which enables him tobe called an extraordinary member.     The Reforms Committee think therefore that the distinctionbetween ordinary and extraordinary members may advantageouslybe abolished.  The  schedule  accordingly provides for the repeal of  sections  35   and  37   of  the  Act,  and   for  the   necessaryconsequential amendments in sections 36,  90,  and 92.                          Clause 18.     This clause,  following the  recommendations of the Report,enables the salaries of the whole of  the India Office Establishmentto be paid out of Imperial funds if  Parliament  chooses to vote themoney, and provides that  the salary  of the  Secretary of  state is  to be so paid.  The clause may require some modification asthe  result of the  deliberations  of  the  Committee appointed toreport on  the India  Office.   The  terms  of  reference to  thisCommittee are set out as  Appendix C. to these notes.     It  is thought  that the  clause in its  present  form  would apply  not  only  to  the India  Office  Establishment,  strictly  socalled, but also to the members of  the  Council  of India, and tothe auditor of the  India Office accounts, with respect  to whom
it is separately provided by sections 3  (8) and 27 (9) of the Actthat their salaries are to be paid out of the revenues of India.                           Clause 19.     This clause has already been referred  to in the note on the preamble, but whether or not Lord Ilaldane&apos;s clause is  adopted, itis of the first  importance that  there  should  be a general power,as responsible government develops, to  relax the rigid safeguards,which appear at many  points  in the  principal Act, for control by  the  Governor-General and the government  at home.     Unless some such  power  is  conferred, provisions such  assection  2 (2) (which  enables  the Secretary of  State  to super-intend,   direct,  and control all operations  and  concerns which relate  to  the  government or  revenues of  India),  section 33(which  requires the Governor-General to pay obedience to allorders which he may  receive from the Secretary of State), and section  45 (which  requires local governments to  pay attentionto  all  orders  of the Governor-General in  Council,  and  statesthat  every  local  government  is  under  the  superintendence,direction, and  control  of  the  Governor-General  in all  matters relating to  the government of  that  province)  could always beappealed to  by  reactionary forces for the purpose  of defeatingthe tendencies which it is  proposed to encourage.                         Clauses 20-22.     These clauses are not  based on specific  recommendations inthe  Report.   The  Report  does, however,  refer  on  frequentoccasions to  the position  of  the public services, under  the  new proposals,  and   the  general  intention of  the Report  appearsclearly  from  such passages as those contained in paragraphs 323and 325.     The  Reforms  Committee have  therefore  thought  it  their duty  to give careful  consideration to the  legislative measureswhich  are  needed  for   regulating and  protecting the  public services  in India.  The  Committee  take the view that it is ofgreat importance, in view of the reforms which are proposed inthe constitution  of the  central and local  governments  in india that the position of the  public  services should be placed on a secure  footing  and should not depend  as  it  does now  uponinnumerable  regulations  made  under  powers which are not inall  cases clear  beyond dispute.     Sir James  Meston  has given special  attention  to  this sub-ject and  has  submitted  a memorandum, copies of which havebeen  separately  circulated.  Part IV.  of  the Bill is  the direct
 outcome of  Sir  James  Meston&apos;s  suggestions, and it does not seem necessary to discuss  the matter further  in these notes.      Sir James Meston has submitted a further memorandum on &quot; Treasury control&quot; which  has also been circulated.  The greater part of the  suggestions in  that  memorandum do not  require statutory provision, but can be dealt with under clause 1 of this Bill.  The  proposals in clause  22, however, are based on sugges- tions  in the  latter memorandum.   It is perhaps  not  strictly necessary  even  in  this  case  to  insert  any express  statutory provision,  but the  Reforms Committee are of opinion that the principles   involved are  of  such importance and would so  tend to promote public confidence, that it is desirable to find a  place for  them in the statute.     It should be noted  that the rules  framed under this part of the  Bill will  not  be  governed  by. clause   25, and  will  not therefore be required to  be laid before Parliament.   This follows the  analogy of rules  framed under section  95 of  the Principal Act.     In connection with these clauses the  question has been raised&apos; whether this  enactment will  not give  rise  to  a  demand for inclusion in the Bill of provisions to give effect to  the proposals of the Royal Commission on the Public  Services in India (Report, Vol. i.,  p.  163) relating  to  the  revision  of   section 98  and of Schedule III. of  the principal Act.   The Reforms  Committee have not felt justified  in including  any such  provision for two reasons,  firstly that this matter lies  outside  the  scope  of the Reforms Report, and secondly that they are  not acquainted with the  views   of  the  Government of  India on  the  proposals  inquestion, which they  understand  have  not  yet  reached   the Secretary of State.  &apos;                           Clause 23.     This clause  gives effect to  the  proposals  of  the  report for the  appointment  of a statutory  commission.   It   is  of  course unusual  to  legislate for an  event  which is to  take  place many years after  an Act is passed, but it  is apprehended  that it is an essential ingredient  of  the  proposals now made that  this corn- mission  should be  appointed  when  the  time comes,  and  the surest guarantee of  this  is  to provide for it forthwith.     It hardly  seems necessary  at this  point to look beyond the first  appointment of a   commission  and  to  provide, as con tern-. plated by the Report, for periodical councils being  appointed at certain intervals of  years.
                           \Olause 24.     This  clause  is  not  based on  any recommendation  of  the Report, but attention has been given  for  some time  past  to  the question of  the possible relaxation of the  stringent restrictions contained  in s. 124 (4) of the Act, on dealings and transactions by way of  trade or  business on the part  of certain specified officials, and the urgency of  the  matter  is  accentuated  by  the proposal  to increase  the  number  of  non-official members   of executive councils.  The Act as it  stands would involve, if  strictly interpreted, the consequence that  the  great landholder or a man of  large commercial interests,  from which  classes appointments of  non-officials would necessarily be made, would  be  required to surrender  his  interest in  his  estates,  possessions,  and  trade  for the brief period of his  time of office.  This  would clearly be an impossible obligation  to impose or to observe as  a condition  of offering or accepting  the  appointment, and a decision to legislate in  this sense on the first opportunity had been previously recorded by the Secretary of State in  Council.  The Reforms Committee accordingly suggest that advantage be taken of  the present oppor- tunity to provide for the relaxation of the  statute  in  order  to meet a  situation not  contemplated  when  these restrictions were originally  imposed, more than a  hundred  years ago.     Section  124  (4) has. been. amended by the Schedule so  as to  bring ministers  within  the scope  of  its  provisions.  This, it is thought, can  be treated  as a consequential amendment of the Act,  following as a  matter  of course  on  the creation  of the office of minister.          (,                           Clause 25.     This clause  does  not appear  to need any comment.                           Clause 26.     The subject-matter of this clause lias  already been alluded to in the general note above.  The proposals in the Schedule are, practically  Avithout exception,  strictly consequential on the pro- visions  in  the  Bill, and it  is  hoped that  they will  be accepted as such by the  House of Commons, especially since,  as has already been announced, the Bill is to  be  referred  o a Select Committee. ,   As pointed  out in the  note to clause  24,  a reference  to ministers has  been inserted in section 124  (4), and  a  similarreference has also been inserted in section 110 which provides  forthe  exemption of members of  a governors executive council
from certain forms  of  process.   It is thought that this alsomay be regarded  as  following as a  matter of  course  from  thecreation of the office of minister.                           Clause  27.     The first  part of  this clause has  been  referred to  in  the note on clause  3.  The proviso is  intended  to  meet  a difficulty which  has  been  felt  under  the  existing  law  with regard  tocertain   appointments,   notably  that of  Government  Pleader,which,  while carrying  no position  which can reasonably be held to constitute a  disqualification  for  election as a member of a legislative  council,  have  none the  less  raised doubts  as  towhether their holders  can technically be held  to be  unofficialpersons.                           Clause  28.     Subsection (2) of  this clause is  based  on  the precedent  inthe India Councils Act, 1909; it may obviously be necessary thatdifferent provisions of  the Bill should come  into  operation at different times in  different places.     Subsections (3) and  (4) are necessary       (1) because  in various  Acts  in force  in India there  are             references to Acts repealed and re-enacted by  the             Act of 1915,  and  the absence  of  any such provision             in that Act has  led to  considerable inconvenience;             and      (2) to meet the case  of  references in letters patent and             other documents  to  the  &quot; Governor-General   in             legislative council,&quot; and the  use of other  expres-             sions which  will  become  obsolete  as   a  result  of             the proposals  now  made.-                           SCHEDULE.     The only provisions  in the  Schedule  which  are  not strictlyconsequential on some provision in the  Bill are  the subsectionswhich it is proposed to substitute  for sections 64 (4), 75 (4), and78 (3).   These  provisions in the principal Act are very obscurelyworded, and in view of  the new  character which it is proposedto give to  the  various  legislative   bodies it is  thought thatprovisions  of a  more  precise  character should  be  substituted.It may, however,  be thought  advisable  that  a  provision  shouldbe inserted in  the body  of the  Bill justifying  this alteration  ofthe law.

Memoranda  by Sir  James Meston on (i)  the Public Services in     India,  and (ii) Treasury  Control  and Audit  in  connection    with Indian Constitutional Reforms.                      I.-PUBLIC SERVICES IN INDIA.                                (1) Introductory.     I. There are two outstanding pronouncements in the Report regarding the public services.   On the one  hand, it  is laid  down (paragraph  59) that  there is to be  noduplication  of the services:-&quot; To require Ministers to inaugurate new services for&quot; their own  departments would  be to saddle  them with difficulties that would- doom&quot; the experiment to failure.&quot;  On the other band, it  is declared (paragraph 325) that&quot; any public servant,  whatever  the Government under which he  is employed, shallbe properly supported and protected in the legitimate exercise of his functions &quot; ;and  the Government of India and the  Governor-in-Council are to have unimpairedpower to &quot; secure these essential requirements.&quot;   That is to say, the machinery of thepublic service, as it  exists to-day, is to  be placed at the disposal  of Ministers, and given adequate protection in its new situation.     2.&quot;This will not be practicable without certain measures of  regulation whichhave  not hitherto been codified, and which it did not become necessary to codify solong as the public services remained entirely under official control.   The  duty  ofobedience by the subordinate officer and of protection  by  the superior officer wasunwritten law ;  and there was  a  homogeneity  of interests and traditions  between those who laid down  public policy and those who executed it, which had the effect of leaving to a mutual understanding  several matters that in  other countries are moreformally defined.  The position will be  altered now,  with the public services coming,in an increasing  measure, under proper  control.   It will be only fair both to Ministers-and to public servants  that they should be supported by a  clear regulation of theirformal relations to each other.   And it is eminently desirable that they should find this regulation established from the outset of the new conditions.   If this view is accepted,the further consideration at once arises,  that there ought not to be one Jaw for public servants working under Ministers, and another for those who remain under  the officialpart  of the Government.  So  far as may be, the public employe should find himselfunder a similar  regime in whatever branch of the administration he may  serve.   Soalso  the claims of Ministers  upon the  public  service  and their  duties towards  it,should be closely comparable  with those of the  official members of the Government.The Avhole machinery ought to be arranged so that the transfer of a department fromone part of the Government to  the other should cause the least possible dislocation,or change iu the  conditions of their service, among the permanent  officials employedin the department.    3. It is suggested,  therefore, that no time should be lost in reducing to statutoryform  the main rights and duties of the  public services in India, in so far as they arenot already prescribed by law  or rule.   It is  advisable that  the formal  description ofprocedure should be tested and,  where necessary, corrected before Ministers take overcharge of  departments.   It  is also well that, public  servants should quickly  getaccustomed  to giving or seeking formal authority for much that they have hithertotaken for granted.  The following set of propositions are accordingly submitted as a rough basis for the necessary law and rules.  A few explanatory notes conclude thememorandum; and if  the general principles are accepted, draft  clauses  for a  Bill,with, subsidiary regulations and  instructions, will follow.                             (2)  General Principles.    1. In each  province,  all public servants  working in the &quot; field of  provincialadministration&quot;  should be classified in three  divisions, of which the first will  be known as the Imperial,  and the second as the Provincial, Division.    10 SS 41 100  1/1.9                     A
     2. Every new post created in future within the &quot;field of provincial adininistra- tion&quot; should he  added to the division to the  work of which its  duties  are  most comparable, and its emoluments should be determined accordingly.     3. Recruitment for all branches  of  the Imperial Division should ordinarily be conducted under  the  orders of the Secretary of State or the Government  of India, and for the Provincial Division under the orders of the Governor-in-Council; and no change in  this respect should lie made except on the recommendation of  a  Statutory Commission.     4. All existing rules for the conduct oLGovernment servants should remain in full force and of general application.     5. In each province,  the rules and codes governing the conditions and  incidents of public service  should  be reviewed and simplified, in conformity with fundamental rules  to be laid down by the Secretary of State which  may not be infringed without his approval.     b\ In matters of posting, promotion and discipline, subject always to Principles 7 and 8 below, members of the Imperial and Provincial Divisions who are  whole-time officers in (a) a  &quot;reserved&quot; and (6) a &quot; transferred &quot; department will be under the control of (a) the Governor-in-Council and (6) the Minister concerned, respectively.     7. Members of the Imperial and Provincial Divisions should have the following rights of appeal      (a) to the Public Service Commission regarding the  interpretation of  any law or           statutory regulation affecting the public service ;     (b) to the Government of  India against any  disciplinary  order affecting their           emoluments or pensions;     (c) to the  Secretary  of State  on any matter within such  limits and subject to           such conditions as he may from time prescribe.     8. An office]- of the Imperial Division may not be dismissed except by order of the Secretary of State,  and an officer of  the Provincial Division  may not be dismissed without the concurrence of the Government of India.     9. Members of the third Division who are whole-time officers in (a) a &quot;reserved &quot; and (b) a &quot; transferred &quot; department will be under the general and  final, control of (a) the Governor-in-Council  and  \b)  the Minister  concerned,  respectively.    In &quot; transferred &quot;  departments Ministers will be invited  to  make  regulations for  the recruitment, remuneration and conditions  of service of future incumbents of the third Division.     10. Members  of any  division of the public service who are employed  for part of their time in a &quot; reserved  &quot; and for part of their time in a &quot; transferred &quot; department should be treated as if  they were whole-time officers in  the  &quot; reserved &quot; department in which they serve; and  if a Minister is  dissatisfied with their work or conduct, he should communicate his complaints and proposals to the Governor-in-Council.     11. Every  Secretary to Government and every permanent head of a department should have a right of  direct access to the Governor in such, manner as the Governor may direct.     .12. It should  be publicly defined as among the  duties of a Governor that he is to work for harmony and  mutual confidence between both parts of his Government and . the public  service; that he  is responsible  for  conserving the security  and  the corporate  effectiveness of public servants, and for maintaining  conditions  favourable to satisfactory recruitment.     13. Legislative authority should be obtained as soon  as possible either by clauses in the  Bill now  under  preparation or by an Act of the Indian legislature, or in both. these  ways, defining,  so far as this has not already been done by  Parliament,  theposition, duties, rights, and liabilities  of  public servants wherever  employed,  and giving powers to-make  all essential rules at present embodied  in the various executivecodes.    14. The same enactment should create a body  of Public  Service  commissioners in India, and define their status and duties.
OOdilatory Notes.     1. The position which these general principles are intended to establish may now be conveniently described in a less formal manner.  The preliminary step of dividing the whole of the public  service tinder  each Local Government  into  three  classes (Principles I and 2) will merely carry out the existing theory in India in a more logical and complete form than it now  assumes.  Some such classification  has  been found  necessary  in the  Dominions ;   and it will  enable greater simplicity to  be introduced into the various codes and service regulations,  This last matter is a reform which, ou its own needs, is overdue; and  Ministers certainly could not  be  asked  to take over the extravagant complications  of the existing  codes and manuals.  It is suggested, therefore, that a complete revision should be undertaken. (Principle 5) of  all rules  and orders relating to the mechanism of the  public services, recruitment, pay, promotion, leave,  pension, discipline, and other conditions of employment.  At first the provinces will probably  work  on the  Civil Service Regulations, Civil Account Code, and the other all-India manuals now in force ;  but as they get time to consolidate and simplify,  and work out their  own codes, they may reasonably  lie given some latitude for variety between  province and province.  Uniformity in essentials  should be secured by the  declaration by the  Secretary of State of fundamental  rules for the public services  generally, such  as  he has already promulgated for the leave  of employes  of  Indian railway  companies.   From  these  no  exception  should   be possible  without  his&apos;  approval; and the  provincial  codes should be  based upon them  and should follow them  in  spirit.   This measure  will  be an  important part of  the intended  delegation of executive authority from  the Secretary  of State and the Government of India to provinces.     2. The stratification of the Indian Services into three divisions should present  no great  difficulty.   The  chief  criterion   will be  the appointing authority.  Broadly speaking,  the Imperial  Division  would  include services  for which the Secretary of State recruits the whole or a  considerable  part of the members the services,  in fact,   in which it is desired  to retain a  strong element  of  Europeans or Indians-educated  in Europe.  The Provincial Division would embrace posts with duties of a responsible character,  and  not of  a   merely clerical type,  for  which the Local Government ordinarily recruits.  Posts for which the Government of India at present recruit could  be  treated as Imperial&quot; or Provincial, according to the  nature of their duties.  All  subordinate and  clerical posts would come into the third  Division.   It will probably be found that  the  classification  will entail considerable  changes  in existing nomenclature.   The present  line of demarcation, for example,  between Imperial  and Provincial  officers in  services such  as  the Public Works Department, has lost much of its original justification, and. will probably be modified  as a result of  Lord  Islington^ Commission ;  it operates  with  considerable  unfairness  in  its present form.  Again,  a number of grades  do not now receive  provincial  status, although  their  officers   are  recruited  on uniform  qualifications  for  the  whole province,  and  may  be  liable for service in any  part  of  the  province.   From this point  of view, such classes  as the  Naib Tahsildar, the sub-Assistant Surgeon, and the like, may be  conveniently placed ad hoe  in the Provincial Division.  Similarly, all miscellaneous  posts, not being  of  a  purely  subordinate character,  which are not at present in either  the  Imperial  or  Provincial category, would be treated  as belonging to  one or the  other  if  fhew are of  similar status,  or recruited  for in a similar way, to those branches  respectively.     3. The third Division would take  in.  all appointments  of  lower than Provincial status.  They would usually  be the posts which  are  filled  departinentally, or  by district officials, without reference to  a central authority.     4. It is suggested that this classification should at present be undertaken only, to use the phrase of the  Report (paragraph 238), in the   field  of provincial admiiii- stration &quot;  which is to  be clearly marked off  from that of  the central  Government. The division inlo Imperial and Provincial classes might not be easy in  services like the Railways, Post Office or Customs; and  it is not necessary for present purposes, though power may suitably be taken  to make it when the necessity  arises.     5. These preliminaries being disposed of. the basic idea of the whole scheme is that the structure of the public service, its duties and the  general conditions of  its employment should remain as  far as possible  untouched by political change.  When
 a Minister is placed in  charge of a &quot; transferred &quot; department he will take it-over as a going concern  with  its staff  intact.  The &quot; Indianisalion &quot; of the  services is an entirely separate  matter.  The authority which recruits for  each branch will see to this,  in accordance with tho general policy prescribed by the Secretary of State.  The actual recruits, whether European or Indian and in whatsoever proportion,  will come into  a service  regulated on uniform lines and as  little  concerned with political controversy  as  possible.  The existing standards of  conduct should, be maintained, for all public servants however  employed (Principle 4).   They will be required, to show the same diligence  and fidelity to Ministers as to  the official part of the Local Government.  The general conditions of their service  will continue to be ordered by the  service  regulations (or  by  any special contract of  recruitment), no  difference being made wherever  they are  employed.   If they are serving in a &quot; transferred &quot; department, the Minister in  charge of it will pay them  and contribute  on  a defined scale to the cost of their  pension and leave  allowances.  And they will be amenable to the  Ministers orders  and discipline  (Principle 6),  just  as  they  will  be  in a &quot;reserved &quot;  department to the orders and discipline of  the Govemor-in-Council.  On the other hand, while Ministers will be supported in requiring their  staff to carry out&apos;their policy, their employes  will be  protected, as now, against arbitrary  or  unjust treatment.   To this  end they will be given reasonable access to the authority by which they  were recruited (Principle 7), and they may not  be dismissed, without at least the order of  that authority (Principle 8) a rule universally accepted  at present. But, in fairness to Ministers, the.power of intervention between them and the  public servants under  their control  should be kept down to the minimum, and the right of appeal from Ministers  should be as little in evidence  as  possible.   In this view the opportunities for appeal should be restricted to a few definable points on which public servants have at present a full right of petition.     6.  It  will frequently occur  that a public servant will  have duties in both a &quot; reserved &quot;  and  a &quot; transferred &quot;  department;  the district officer will be the most prominent instance of this type from the outset of the scheme up to the time when full- responsible government is reached.   It will make for simplicity and avoid a most improper  conflict of jurisdiction if such officers  are  kept under the control of the official part of the Government, for purposes of  posting, promotion  and discipline. It may have to be arranged that Ministers will contribute to their emoluments in a ratio to be fixed by the  Governor (ultimately by rule),  and similarly  to their pensions- on retirement. .  On  the side  of  their  -work  which concerns  the &quot; transferred &quot; departments, they will  have  to  take and carry out the directions of Ministers  in the same manner as if.they were whole-time officers in those departments;  and Ministers should inform the official half of the Government of any failure in  that respect of which they have  to complain (Principle  10).  In actual practice  it may be hoped that the wise instruction of officers  who owe a  dual allegiance and their encourage- in ent to work loyally for Ministers, will be one of the foremost duties of the Governor (vide  infra), and one in which  he will be fully  supported  by  his  executive councillors.     7.  Officers of the third Division working wholly in  a  &quot;transferred&quot; department may be placed at  once  under  the final control  of the  Minister in  charge, who will stand to them in the same position as the Local Government does now (Principle 9). Their existing rules and privileges will have to be maintained for present incumbents who  go over to Ministerial   control with  their  departments; and. in particular their pensions and provident funds must be secured.  But  for  the future, Ministers may quite probably desire a simpler code of regulations for this class of officers  and more- elasticity than now obtains.     8. When all these  arrangements have been made, it remains to be recognised that they partake of the provisional and transitory character of the constitutional position during the period, in which they will be operative.  The time will come certainly, when full  responsible government  is attained, and possibly earlier-when Ministers will wish to organise their services  in their own way, to recruit  in accordance with their own policy,  and to fix their own terms as to pay and conditions of service.  In a word, independent popular control over the public services of the country will  be the goal.  At  present, however, it would be unjust to every interest concerned the people, the officials, the Ministers themselves-to  saddle  Ministers with  such a task.   They will depend, for a long  time to come, on the  help which can be  provided only by the traditions  and training  and assured status of the existing public  services.  Moreover,.
the broad lines on which the services are to order themselves must be prescribed and.kept under  control by experienced minds  if  the  first steps towards  responsible government are to be fairly judged both in their general working and  in  their  effecton the welfare of the  people.  On all grounds, therefore, it is desirable  to giveMinisters  ample time before they try  to  establish  a  public  service  of  their owncontrivance.  In what departments they should, if they so desire, make a beginning,and  on what conditions,  might suitably  be  investigated by  the  first  statutory commission  sent out by Parliament  (Principle&apos; 3).  It may  be presumed  that theCommission would not be prepared to recommend the withdrawal of an Imperial orProvincial service from  any branch  of the  administration until Ministers haveembodied in formal legislation a complete and satisfactory scheme for the enrolment,training, regulation, conduct and  emoluments of the service by which they propose toreplace the old agency.  Again,  speaking broadly, and merely as a  record  of ourpresent ideals for the public service, such legislation would be expected      (a) To secure selection, over  the widest possible field, on merits and qualifications,           a.nd to reduce the risks of nepotism ;     (b) To ensure efficient training for the higher and more responsible duties ;     (c) To guarantee discipline and integrity on the part of the employes ;  and     (d) To provide adequate pay, security of tenure, and  satisfactory conditions of           work in regard to such matters as pensions, promotion, and  leave.     9. It cannot, of course, be expected that ^service under the new conditions will be equally congenial  to all officers now  in the  service, whether  they  be  Europeans orIndians ;  and it has been considered whether officers in a department which is to betransferred should be given a formal option  of going with their department or leaving it.   In the latter alternative, unless they could  be placed in a reserved  department,they would presumably have to be retired on a proportionate pension.   That such an extreme measure  may be necessary in certain cases is practically certain.   There are capable and honest officers to whom the colour difficulty would  be frankly insuperable ;and it would be  obviously unjust  to  dismiss  such men for a temperamental defectwhich has not hitherto militated against their retention  in the service.  But men  ofthis type are well, known, and the Governors duty would be to move them, so far aspossible, out of transferred departments and to  put in men  with  whom Ministers arelikely  to get on well.  It seems inadvisable  to give  any formal option  of  serving, orrefusing  to  serve under Ministers.   Volunteers would be comparatively few, and the regime would start with a feeling of discomfort  on the  part of Ministers towards menwho were suspected of serving them unwillingly.  It is better to abide by the regularrule that a public  servant is required to fulfil any duty that  is imposed upon  him, and,when all other expedients are exhausted, to get  rid quietly of the few men who wouldnotoriously  be out of place in the new system.  The existing  rules  for compensationpensions might suitably  be applied.     10. There is no advantage  in.  disguising  the delicacy  of. the  new   situation.Ministers  will be  taking over departments staffed by public servants,  European and indian alike, who  have no experience of popular government, and who will tend to beimpatient of the methods and mistakes of amateurs, and possibly resentful of abruptchanges in policy.   Ministers, on the other hand,  may be apprehensive of obstructivenesson the part of their permanent officials, and  intolerant of the slowness and rigidity of official methods.   The mutual distrust  of officialdom  and the  nationalist enthusiastseannotbeexpectedtodieclownaton.ee.  The task of  making  the. new arrangementsa success  will thus be far from easy ; and it is  a task which must largely fall  on theGovernor.  His influence with. Ministers, if wisely applied,  should go far  to secure their treating their permanent officials fairly and frankly.  The power of his personalitywith the services  will encourage them to persevere  in circumstances which they mayoften find disconsolate and difficult.  Rules may ensure to the  public service a formalimmunity from formal grievances ; but no rules can guarantee it against pin-pricksand petty annoyances and indignities, and the heavy punishment of uncongenial work.It is  the  personal advice  and guidance  and pressure of the Governor which mustmitigate these dangers on.the one hand, and&apos;maintain the loyalty and friendliness ofthe permanent officials to their new masters  oh the other hand.     11. It is of genuine importance that this duty of lubricating the whole machineshould  be definitely  and  formally laid upon  the  Governor, and  that his role asprotector  of the public services should be known  and  recognised,  both by  Ministers     ss4i                               a
Gand  by public servants.  It is suggested, therefore, that the matter should be  incor-porated in the regular instructions to Governors, and that a declaration to the same effect should be made in the course of presenting the Reforms scheme to  Parliament(Principle 12).  The manner in which the Governor will be kept in  touch  with theinterests involved is simple enough.   Ministers will come direct to him  with  any difficulties  they may  have with public servants, and  any  complaints  of imperfectsupport or  worse.  The services will  have the permanent heads of  departments torepresent their difficulties,  and those  officers ought to have a  right to ask for  an interview with the Governor whenever they  consider necessary.  The secretaries toGovernment also should bring to the Governors notice any discontent or bad feeling-their access to him being the same as  at preseut, whether their  departments are inthe charge of an executive Councillor or a  Minister  (Principle  11).  The  GovernorAvill thus have every opportunity of watching the situation.  Me Avill  usually be ableto remove trouble by a few Avords of advice or persuasion.  If the difficulty  is acuteor widespread, he may have to  investigate it with the help of the  joint advice of his council and Ministers.  But there should be no formal  appeals except  to the extentalready suggested, and  it  is submitted  that the Governor-in-Council should not bebrought in as an  agency of arbitration in the grievances of public servants.  Such acourse, it is feared, Avould generate difficulties between  Ministers and the ExecutiveCouncil.  The former would resent the exercise  of any  quasi-appellate authority overthem by the latter; a door would be opened to lobbying ;  and exaggerated suspicionsof intrigue would be aroused.     12. These considerations point to the conclusion that in two respects  the Reportcannot be literally translated into practice.   In paragraphs 240 and 325  the protectionof the interests of the public services is made the duty of the Governor  in ExecutiveCouncil.  This, it is  feared, would defeat  the  object  Avhich the Report  intends tosecure,  for  the work of the public services cannot  be formally made  a  reservedsubject, and any less drastic a measure of general protection would inevitably lead tofriction between the two parts of the  Government.  Again, in the  same  paragraphsand in paragraphs 15b&apos; and 259, expressions  are used which will be read as promisingdetailed support and protection to  a public servant in  the discharge of his duties.This, however, seems necessarily to involve  intervention  so frequent as to  embitterMinisters against both their own officials and the protecting authority.  All  that can safely be guaranteed is  a generous right of  appeal in clearly defined circumstances,and the steady influence of a vigilant Governor in the direction of harmonious Avorkingand good feeling.     13. It  has now to be  considered what should be the statutory . basis for thearrangements indicated above.   In few respects  is the  public service of  India moredependent  on tradition,  and prestige than in  its legal status.  The &quot; Covenanted CivilService&quot;  is amply  safeguarded,  in  its  constitution,  appointments,  pensions,  andannuities upon retirement for  ill-health (Government of India Act,  1915, and IndiaAnnuity Funds Act,  1874).  Certain high officials, judges, and  ecclesiastical officers are also the subjects of  special  enactments.  But for the various regulations  covering-other branches of the public  service, or for  their pay, pension, or  other privileges,there seems to be little or no statutory.authority.   There is nothing, for example,corresponding to the Superannuation Acts of the United Kingdom;  and  most  of theprovisions  relating to all the essential conditions of employment are liable to arbitrarychange by  the executive Government.  Hitherto this has caused little inconvenience ;but it is one of the points at whioh practice  should be stiffened and defined before the transition  from  official to popular control  begins.   It is suggested, therefore,  that legislation should be undertaken (Principle 13); a few  fundamental  matters being-inserted in the coming Act of Parliament, and further  details  being  settled either by Regulations under the Act or separately  enacted in the Indian legislature.  Thereare abundant precedents in the Dominions for such an enactment, and its preparationcan easily be fitted in with the revision of Service regulations proposed above.     14.&apos; Finally, a more satisfactory agency  than  now exists will  be  required fordealing  with the recruitment  of  public servants in India, and for regulating thegeneral conditions of public service.  The  present  distribution of  patronage  is notmerely criticised by the best Indian opinion ; it  is extremely laborious in its  efforts to eliminate types^ouritism and to ensure that public offices are not swamped by particularsections of the community.   It  would- almost certainly  break down under a less
centralised and detached  type  of  administration than ours; and, even if  only  as  apreparation for  future  contingencies, a more impersonal method of selection and regulation should be adopted for  all branches of the public service without delay.This can onlv be secured  by setting up a  Public Service Commission (Principle .14)at the headquarters of the Government of  India, with statutory powers and  duties.These duties would include, it  is suggested, the following :-To select, in accordancewith the general policy of each  Local Government, the entrants to provincial, services ;to regulate the qualifications for subordinate services ; to bring the public  service asa career into touch with tho general  educational system  of the country; to conductdepartmental and language tests (probably absorbing the present Board of- Examiners);to be the executive agency for regulating the general conditions of public service under the provisions of  the new Act or of any existing law or contract;  and to bethe appellate authority on the interpretation  of all service rules made under the  law.Whether  the  Commission should be under the  Government of India, or directly responsible to the Secretary of State, is  a matter for consideration.   But it  would presumably be a central: body for all India, with  such provincial agencies as it  might find necessary.    21th August 1918.                  II. TREASURY  CONTROL  AND  AUDIT.    1. An essential preliminary to the development of  responsible  government  inIndia will be to overhaul, strengthen, and invest with the necessary legal status and powers, tho position of  the  Treasury and the Audit.  It  needs no emphasising thatefficiency in the collection of  the  public  revenue, and propriety and economy in its expenditure, are among the most important functions of a Government.  In India thishas been realised to the full; but the successful exercise of. these  functions has  been largely based on the autocratic power of the Government,  and on its confidence in itsown integrity.   Subject to the ultimate control of the Secretary of State and to  aninfinity of mechanical rules, the tendency has been to trust responsible public servants to be  diligent in collecting the revenue, to rely on them to  use it for the best interestsof the public,  and not to fetter them unduly in its expenditure.  Even under a morepopular system of administration  this confidence  must be largely maintained.  Butthe responsibility  for public finance will gradually shift; its administration will  be subjected  to  much keener and more  public scrutiny;   and the consequences of criticism will be more definite.   Clearer regulation will thus be necessary, and  certain changes in method.  This would be  advisable if only for closer assimilation  to theEnglish model; for  the present methods of financial control in  India differ  from, andin some  ways are less effective than, is  customary under normal conditions  in theUnited Kingdom.   But, as  will be  seen  below,  there  are more cogent reasons foradvance than mere imitation ;  and this memorandum endeavours to suggest the moreobvious lines of reform.  It is confined entirely to discussing the control of expenditure.The assessment and collection of the revenue must for the present continue on existinglines ; the maintenance and development of  the efficiency of the responsible depart-ments being a matter of  general  administrative skill rather than of  intervention bythe Treasury or the Audit.    2. In law the  ultimate authority for all expenditure from Indian  revenues is theSecretary of State in  Council.  In  practice  he  has devolved  by general or  specialorders a large measure of  his authority on the Government of India.  They in turnhave handed on much of their  derivative authority  to Local Governments, who againhave made minor delegations to a variety of responsible officials subordinate to them.All these  delegations are  embodied in codes ; and the duty  of the  various FinanceDepartments.in India is to see that all projected  expenditure of public money is  inaccordance  with those codes, as well as to look generally after the interests  of the taxpayer.   In  practice, however, the letter of  the codes would cover much expenditure which would not serve those interests ; and if a Finance Department  does its duty, itmay frequently find  itself  in conflict with the authority which has the legal power to spend.  In such conflicts,  the strength of the Finance Department varies greatly withthe disposition of the executive Government, and it has no external support.  In the
  central Government, its position is not unsatisfactory, for  the Finance Member  is not  embarrassed by the charge of other portfolios, and can urge his  case in Council with  force and some prospect of support from those of his colleagues who are not committed  to the projected expenditure.  In the provinces the position of the Department is less  assured, and depends largely on personal influence and the  backing it receives from  the head of the province.   With some branches of the administration, e,g., irrigation,  the financial control and the observance of strict  economy are almost entirely at the  discretion of the executive and supervising officers.   Other branches allow the Finance  Department to be more inquisitorial into their affairs, but its power is far from always  being so definite as it ought to be.      3. In no respect is the divergence between existing conditions  and the methods  of democratic finance more noticeable than  in  the treatment  of the Budget.   (The  term  Budget will  be  used throughout  this Memorandum in the Indian  sense.  It  means the estimates for the coming financial year, which, after being presented to and  discussed in  the Legislative Council,  become automatically  the authority for the  supply of funds to the spending departments.)   The divergence referred to is  seen  in three features of the Budget procedure, both of the Government of India and of the  provincial Governments : &apos;      (a) The  Budget is not passed by the legislature ; they are confined to  the right            of criticism, which there is no obligation on the Government to accept.      (b) Projects of expenditure are frequently entered in the Budget before they have            been matured or  subjected to  any  close examination  in  the  Finance         *   Department.      (c) Transfers of funds from one Budget grant  to  another   are entirely at the            discretion of the Executive Government,  i.c, without any reference to the            legislature  the Government  can  divert money budgeted for one purpose           to another and wholly unconnected purpose.     The third of these is a natural corollary of  the first;  and  both will have to be altered when the legislature becomes responsible for expenditure.  The second requires modification in the interests of sound finance, whatever be the form of government. The three taken together are symptomatic of financial laxity, which, however innocuous it may be  in  practice  at present, would be intolerable  under  a more  democratic Government.     4.  Turning to the Audit Department in India, we find it notoriously  overgrown with  burdensome formalities.   It makes a fetish of  the codes, and tends  to neglect their spirit  in  its observance of  their  letter.   Until recently it was  exceedingly rare for the Audit Department  to question the wisdom of  any charge on  public funds, or whether it  accorded with  the &apos;policy of the  Government, or whether it was on the most  economical scale  compatible with securing the desired result.  As  a  rule, all that the auditor asked was proof that (a) the money was spent on its declared purpose, and (6) there was proper  formal authorisation under  the  codes for its expenditure. Assured on  these points, the auditor had no desire to criticise the authority.  Since the elevation, a few years ago, of  the Auditor-General&apos;s  position,  some improvement has been effected ; but  there still  remains an immense volume of  formal and useless routine in the offices  of  the  various  Accountants-General, coupled with a  want of courage and initiative in challenging questionable expenditure.     5.  There is no suggestion that these defects have resulted  in  widespread misuse- of the taxpayers&apos; money in India.   On the contrary, the standard of financial integrity has  been high.  But as  responsible  government develops, and  the searchlight of public opinion is turned upon the public expenditure,  the honourable traditions of the past will have lo be anchored on more definite regulation lor the work of the  Finance- and Audit Departments.  Sound and upright finance, with  due publicity of working, is essential  to  the success of popular administration; and Ministers will find them- selves very dependent on a powerful  agency of financial control.   They will require a virile independent audit, conducted  on the recognised principles of financial ethics- quite as much as on codes.  Without such support, Ministers  will find  the  faithfulfulfilment  of their  duties to  the taxpayer overwhelmingly difficult.   No  time,therefore, should be lost in providing this support by law and  rule.   The same laws and rules should be accepted, so  far as may be, for the branches of administrationretained under official control, so that  both parts of a provincial Government  may be-working on parallel lines and subject to the same limitations.  It is impossible to lay
too groat stress on having similar machinery and procedure  in dealing with reservedand  with transferred  departments,  either from  the  point  of  view of  comparativeresults, or to facilitate  iuterchangeability when decreed  by future Statutory Oom-missions.     6. Before the curtain rises on the new regime, it  is very desirable to prepare the stage by  a reformation of the codes to which allusion  has  already been made.  Theyattempt to lay down canons of public expenditure  for the whole of India,  and theyare consequently  laden with masses  of exceptions  and  reservations  for individualareas.  In spite of periodical pruning they are crowded with detail.  Isolated efforts of the financial conscience have got crystallised into rules,  to be subsequently modified by provisoes and  elucidated by footnotes, until it is often almost impossible to see thewood for the  trees.  The  scrupulous  regimen of  the codes takes the  place of the pressure  of public opinion;  but it results in elaboration which tends to smother the true spirit of financial vigilance,   To  correct this  it  is suggested  that  the FinanceDepartments  of  the central Government and  of  each province should set to work,each to prepare its own regulations for the proper ordering of the public  expenditure under its control.  Before this task can be undertaken, the degree of autonomy to  be conceded  by  the Secretary of  State  to  the Government of India and  to  local governments should be defined, as contemplated in the Report.  As a  basis  for theconsideration of  this question, it is submitted that the Secretary of State  need not infuture retain in his own hands more than the power of      (a) prescribing the fundamental conditions of expenditure on public  purposes,           including the public services ; and    - (6)  requiring his own previous sanction to                (i)  appointments exceeding a certain  limit of pay,              (ii)  public works exceeding a certain limit of cost, and              (iii)  the  personal expenditure from  public  funds  of  the  viceroy,           Governors and Members &quot;of Executive Councils.Within these or any other limits which are approved, the  new financial codes can bedrawn  up,  and  all  standing orders  reviewed,  simplified,  condensed,  or,  wheresuperfluous, abandoned.  Elasticity  will  thus become  possible,  and variations  (in.reason) between  province  and province,  or department and department, will do no harm.  The work is not only desirable  in itself, but  essential before any measure of popular control is introduced; for financial  autonomy will  have to mean somethingdifferent from the  autocratic rule of  the Accounts  Department,  to  which ministers could not be expected to submit, and from which they would not derive the help thatit should be possible to accord to them.     7. On the assumption that the  broad lines of financial orthodoxy are laid  outwith common sense, and in an intelligible manner, it is possible to sketch the future position of the Departments of Finance and Audit.   The Finance Department of  thecentral Government may  first  be considered.  It  seems  to  require  little, if  any,change  in  its handling of Imperial finances ;  both because  the Imperial Budgetwill not be passed  by the legislature (paragraph 284  of the  Report), and because theposition of the department is already very strong if it  exercises  its powers wisely.Vis-d-vis the local Governments, however, and their finance departments its  position will  be  materially altered.  It will no longer interfere-with  the provincial Budget estimates.  It Avill have no power, on  behalf of  the Government of India, to  sanction or to refuse sanction to projects of expenditure from provincial funds ; for the Govern- ment of India&apos;s authority in regard to these  projects will presumably be restricted to advising the Secretary of State on such of them as ho requires to be submitted for his approval.   In matters of taxation, borrowing, and fiscal legislation by a local Govern- ment, there will be a measure of controlling  authority as described iu the Report (paragraphs 210-211).  Otherwise  the function of the Finance  Department will bo confined to watching  the  financial  policy and  proceedings of the provinces, and  to giving such advice as local Governments may ask for.  In regard to reserved subjects, if interference should seem necessary, it will advise and  be  the  mouthpiece of the Government of  India in the exercise by that body of  its general administrative power of intervention as the authority ultimately responsible to  the Secretary of State for the wise governance of the country.  In regard  to transferred subjects, there will be no interference.  The Governor may at times require help and advice ; and in exceptional cases he  may  have to be urged to intervene effectively  in  the  proceedings  of his       SS -41                                C
Ministers;  but no  direct instructions or advice to them or in relation to the depart-ments in their charge will issue from the central Finance Department.  This at  leastis how it is  understood that the control over provincial  matters will be exercised infuture  by the  Government of India ;  and it  is  impossible to  say more  until themeasure of that control and its method of operation are determined.     8. The position of the Finance Department in a province next requires considera-tion.  At the outset one very important detail  calls for decision.   There are to  be infuture  two  parts of a  provincial. Government; the Governor-in-Council is to retaincertain  of the  sources  of  revenue  and certain of the chief spending departments ;Ministers are virtually to be responsible for collecting certain other classes of revenue and for controlling certain other spending departments.  Is each of these authoritiesto have a separate financial staff to help it ?   Are there to be  two agencies of financial control, one for the reserve! subjects under the Governor-in-Council, the  other for the transferred subjects under Ministers ?   To this the answer must surely be &quot;No.&quot;  Infavour of a dual Treasury there  is no argument of  method ;  slight differences in procedure there may be, but the standards of propriety in the expenditure  of public funds and the ideal of  financial probity must be the same in  every department of theadministration.  There is no argument of  convenience, for it will be a clear advantage to have the whole  financial control under one  roof.   The only possible  argument  isthat, by making the custody of the public exchequer  a  reserved  subject, we shouldinfringe the independence of Ministers in dealing with it on behalf of their transferreddepartments.  This, however,  would betray some  misunderstanding of the Treasury&apos;s functions.  It is not a body which  either dictates or vetoes&apos; policy.   It  watches andadvises  on the financial provisions which are necessary to give effect to policy; and  itsees  that money is not  spent except in  accordance with  policy.   It  would have  these duties to fulfil whether it were under the Governor-in-Council or  under a  Minister.     9. If this argument secures assent and there is one undivided Finance department in each, province,  its duties  and status should  gradually be assimilated,  so far aspracticable, to  those of the English and Dominion, models.   Much of its power will grow up by tradition and practice, as has been the case in the past; but the broadoutlines of  its functions arc capable of being put into regulations.   It would be theconstituted critic  of the  financial  proceedings  of  all  departments, collecting andspending, and the guardian of Budget propriety.  The Memorandum does  not touchon its association  with  the revenue depaitments, regarding which all that need be saidis that  the Treasury should exercise  steady  pressure in  the direction of efficientassessment and collection  of every hind of State receipt;  in relation to expenditureof public money  its role  should  be that of  custodian  of  the  exchequer;  and.theexchequer should not be committed or drawn upon without its knowledge and eitherits consent or that of the local Government after hearing  its views.  It would  have special statutory authority  in regard to the creation and pay of public appointments.     It would support and instruct the audit; and it would  enforce  the requirementsof the auditor and the  Government  of India in&quot; the maintenance of the public accounts.Its status would  be that  of  a reserved department under  the control of a memberof the  Governors  executive  Council.   It would  probably be one of the last of the reserved departments  to  be given  up ;  for its importance is hardly inferior to theimportance of Jaw  and order, and its functions  are analogous  to those of the judiciary.The various functions  suggested above will require much development in. detail bycompetent authority in India; no more than a  recognisable outline is possible in thefollowing brief description.     10.  In  regard to expenditure, the first function  of the  Finance Department willbe to certify projects of expenditure for inclusion in the Budget.  . The invariable rule should  be  that the legislature is  not asked  to sanction Budget provision for anycharge until that charge has been examined by the Finance Department  and certifiedfor inclusion in the estimates.  This, it cannot be too  clearly  emphasised does not mean that the Finance Department can veto policy.  It  can  criticise and ask- forfurther consideration.   It can object  that the  proposed  expenditure is  greater than is necessary for  the execution of a  particular  policy.   It  may  challenge financialheresies and  demand further definition  and  justification of the methods in whichmoney is to be laid out.  But  in the  last resort administrative  considerations  mustprevail.   If there is  a dispute regarding expenditure on  a reserved subject, theFinance Member  may urge that it is wrong or wasteful or  that  it will entail  freshtaxation.   But he  may be overruled  by the  Governor-in-Council.  If the  dispute
370relates to  expenditure  on  a  transferred  subject,  the Finance  Department maysimilarly  expostulate.   But the Minister, in. charge of the particular  subject canoverrule it and its objections, taking the full responsibility for doing so.   In Englandhe would, in theory, have to get the Cabinet behind him in such a case;  in an Indianprovince  he  would  need  only the  concurrence of  the  Governor.  As  practicecrystallises and grows familiar, Ministers will find friendly  and valuable help fromthe Finance Department in developing their schemes of expenditure upon sound and economical lines.     II. A subdivision, though an important one, of this duty is the influence whichthe Finance Department must exorcise in the creation and  pay of  new offices IN thepublic service as well as the increase of existing emoluments. There are few greaterdangers to the growth of a healthy  democracy than the unchallenged swelling of thenumbers of public functionaries.  There are also few occasions on which an executivebased on a popular assembly will be more vulnerable than when  it  is pressed to add to the lists  of appointments  paid from  the public  exchequer.   In  this matter,therefore,  Ministers   will  particularly require the  support of a  strong finance department,   it cannot be expected that the powerful  position which the  EnglishTreasury has built up in controlling public appointments can  easily be achieved  bythe Finance Departments in India.   But this is a  direction  in which their  influenceshould bo deliberately strengthened in every legitimate  manner,  and it  is submitted that the law should specifically require that no public office should  be created,  or  itsemoluments  determined,  without  prior consultation with  the Finance Department.More it  would be  difficult to  ask  for  at present;   This  much would  at leastpermit, the Finance  Department to bring before the  Government  as  a whole anyproposal  AVHICH  it considers contrary to  public interest  or  otherwise improper.It may,  indeed,  bo  hoped that the.  publicity  which  the  procedure  will secureshould be in  itself a considerable deterrent against the  undesirable  expansion ofofficialdom.     12. The next function of an efficient Finance Department carries it  further from existing  practice in  India than some  of the other duties  which  this Memorandumdiscusses.  It is to see  that, when once a  project of expenditure is passed  in theBudget, the money provided for it is spent  in accordance with the intentions  of theauthority the legislature  or branch thereof-which sanctioned  the Budget.   Theultimate responsibility for this check rests of course on the audit; but it is  for theTreasury  to  intervene  before the  mischief is  clone.  For this  purpose it ought in theory to have the right  of controlling  exchequer  issues; that is  to  say,  the rule should be that money required for a project entered  in the Budget will be  issued from the  exchequer only upon  indents  drawn  by  the  responsible  head of thedepartment concerned,  and endorsed by the Finance  Department.  Before agreeing to any exchequer issue,  the Finance Department  would ask to  be satisfied that  themoney is to be employed in accordance with the  sanctioned scheme of expenditure,and that there is Budget provision for it.  No  sanction to an exchequer issue inexcess of the Budget provision would  be given otherwise than on  a  special order ofthe  head of  the  department concerned,  subject  to  subsequent  confirmation by theauthority  which passed  the  Budget; and  it  would  be the  duty  of  the  finance department.to bring the excess to the  notice of that authority.  This is the  theoryof exchequer issues;  and though it would admittedly present difficulties in practice in India, it should  be  brought into  operation gradually.   It AVILL work more easilyin  departments where  large projects  have to be  financed  than in  those where  theexpenditure is mainly on establishments scattered all  over  a province; and, indeed,where the expenditure is  drawn against  the regular fixed scales  of  pay, &amp;c.,  the periodical indent may be found  a  needless formality.  But  wherever there  is  a clear margin  for variation from  the  Budget  provision  at  the  discretion of  theexecutive  authorities, indents on the Treasury at frequent intervals should become the  rule.     13.  An  important  consequence of. this  system  is that  the  Finance Departmentgets timely intimation  of  any  substantial  excess  over Budget provision and of anyproposal  to transfer  savings under one project to permit of such  excess expenditure under another.   With this  information IT must be.provided in any case, whether thesystem of exchequer issues is introduced or not, and it ought to have power,  IFnecessary, to hold up  any serious departure from the Budget intentions until thechange is approved  by  the authority which passed the  Budget.  The practice in the     SS 41            *                   D
United  Kingdom furnishes a model in this respect.   Here the estimated needs of the-spending departments are supplied by the House of Commons in a series of &quot; Votes &quot;each  of which  includes  several  sub-heads of  outlay.   Speaking  generally,  thedepartment concerned  may  re-distribute  the  total sum  of the  Treasury;  but itmay  not exceed the total  in  any vote  without  the approval  of  the House  ofCommons given in the form of a supplementary vote,  and it is for the  Treasury to-see that the matter is brought to the notice of  the  House for that purpose.   In caseof grave urgency requiring excess  expenditure before parliamentary approval can beobtained, the  Treasury may  make an advance  from a  special reserve known as theCivil Contingencies Fund.  It is eminently desirable to  build up a  similar system inthe Indian province.   The same strictness, it  is true,  may not be practicable.   Inthe  last United Kingdom  estimates   there were roughly 150  votes,  apart fromthose for the  Army and the Navy, and also apart from the various  new ministriescreated during the  war.   It would, in the beginning at least, be inconvenient to have so many heads in each of which any excess over the Budget provision would require a resolution, or some  other form of authorisation by the legislature.  At  the outset,it will probably  suffice to lay down that      (a)  the executive department concerned may not transfer budgeted funds between           minor heads of the same major head  without prior  consultation with           the Finance Department ;  and     (b) it may not transfer  funds  between major  heads,  or exceed  the budgeted           provision under any major head, without the concurrence of  the Finance           Department, or the approval of the authority  which passed the  Budget.  \  Experience may show  that, eg,, in the case  of  large public works, some restric-tion should be  placed upon  the power of a department  to  re-appropriate funds  asbetween the items  of a minor head, but the above rule  would secure an adequatesafeguard for the present, namely, that within about  30 definite compartments  ofexpenditure (that being roughly the number of  major heads in a provincial  Budget),the  Finance Department would be in  a  position to  insist upon a reference .to  thelegislature before any  material change is made  in . the budgetary  arrangementssanctioned by  that body.     1-1.  The audit and its functions may be briefly disposed of.  The first desideratumis to give effect  to the suggestion,  broached some years ago and  dropped,  that  theAuditor-General- be given a statutory position, irremovable  by any authority in India,and at the same  time ineligible  for any other public office  in India,  The arguments for this  need  no repetition.  It is the  preliminary essential to ensuring that, in a province, the  audit of all  public accounts shall  be in  the hands  of  an  agency (thelocal Accountant-General acting as the Auditor-General^  deputy) independent bothof the Governor in Council  and of Ministers.   The work of this agency will be toexamine expenditure  with reference to  the  financial regulations of the province, butalso  in the light of the broad  principles of legitimate public finance.  It will not onlysee that there is code authority for all outlay, but it will investigate the necessityfor it.   Was this item in furtherance of the scheme for which the  Budget provided ?Could the same  result have  been  obtained otherwise with greater economy ?   Wasthe rate and scale of expenditure justified in the circumstances ?  If purchases weremade, were they effected with due publicity of tender, &amp;c. ?   The audit will ask everyquestion that might be expected from an intelligent taxpayer anxious to get  the  bestvalue for his  money.   Now  in this task  the audit will, require to be in the closest touch.with the Finance  Department.  That department  will have to advise it regard-ing the scope  and intentions of a  scheme of expenditure, having  been  itself  madefamiliar with  these  from its discussion with the executive  authority concerned at thepreliminary or  estimate stage.  It will be consulted  by the  auditor .about manydetailed applications of financial principles  and the interpretation of  financial rules.It will keep him informed about prices, local  rates of labour, and a hundred otherfacts which are relevant to  his audit, but of which he has no other source of knowledge.The role of the Finance Department of the Government of India  in  relation to  theaudit of the departments under its  direct control will be similar. &quot;&quot;s  15.  The action to be taken upon audit reports will also need careful prescription..Every report  dealing with provincial expenditure will be laid in ordinary coursebefore the Governor  for  communication to the head  of  the  spending  department concerned, Member of Council, or Minister.  But a copy will simultaneously go to theFinance Department for submission to the authority by which the Budget  was passed-
In the case of reserved subjects, the disposal of the report will rest with the Governor-in-Council, who will have power to condone surcharges or disallowances.  But it willbe in the discretion of the Auditor-General to bring to the notice of the Secretary ofState any matter in which he considers that the action  of the local  Government is seriously  contrary  to public interests.   In the case of  transferred subjects,  the-legislature will presumably  delegate the  duty  of  dealing with these reports to aPublic Accounts  Committee.   Once an audit  report conies  before  this body,  theFinance  Department  will then become the champion of the audit.  It must be fully recognised that  the   legislature  has final  power  to condone  any  surcharge  ordisallowance  raised in audit, or any excess over Budget provision  or expenditureon  unbudgeted purposes which may have been challenged by the Finance  Depart-ment.  But it  is for  that Department to insist on the irregularity  being broughtinto the light  of clay, and  to  urge the Public  Accounts  Committee  to give it full consideration and to  deal adequately with the guilty official.   It will  have full rightof  access to  the  Public Accounts Committee,  and should be represented  at  everysitting held in connection with the audit report and the statement of re-appropriations.     16.  The above sketch takes no account of much  in  the existing  constitution ofthe Indian finance departments which is capable of being readily adapted to the new conditions.  It merely discusses in the abstract the preparation necessary for those conditions, and outlines the arrangements which will best give the beginnings of popular government that assistance  in the way of strong financial control which willbe  required to prevent confusion and abuse.  The outline, as has already been said,leaves a great  deal to be filled in by expert knowledge in India ; but that  a startshould be made with  the details at the earliest possible moment, seems incontestable.The main arguments  of the Memorandum may now be  summarised thus :      (1)  The Secretary of State should be  moved to declare the financial powers which           he wishes to retain (cf., paragraph 292 of the Report).     (2)  The financial codes in the Imperial departments and in each  province should           then be revised,  consolidated,  and simplified.     (3)  The Finance  Department in each province should be a  reserved department,           undivided, with  powers of  Treasury control  over  all  the revenue  and           expenditure of the province.     (4)  The Finance  Department should  certify all schemes  of  new expenditure for           inclusion  in the Budget.      (5)  It should be  given statutory power of advising on the staffing and emoluments           of public  offices.      (G)  A beginning should  be made in requiring the authority  of the Finance           Department to the issue  of money from the exchequer.      (7)  The Finance Department should  be  informed of all proposed transfers of           savings (otherwise than within a minor head)  to any other jmrpose; and           it  should  have  discretion to refer to the Public Accounts Committee at           any time&apos; all transfers between or  excesses over major  head provisions            which have been passed by the legislature.      (8) The Auditor-General should have his position and powers defined by Statute            and statutory regulations.      (9) The Audit Department should remain under the Government  of India and be            vitalised.     (10) The audit reports dealing with reserved subjects should be dealt with by the            Governor-in-Council, subject to any  orders of the Secretary of State.     (11) The audit reports dealing with transferred subjects should  be referred to the            Public Accounts Committee, before whom the Finance Department should            be represented.7th September 1918.
