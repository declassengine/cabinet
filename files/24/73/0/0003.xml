I I ills DocHnpennt.)1112Ropert io, 29.030th December,  1918,FORTNIGHTLY RBPOJIT ON Rif/QLUTIONAItY  ORGANISATIONS     IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MORALE ABROAD.(circulated by tho  Homo  Secretary).     Tho shadow of the  General  Election has  boon weighing heavily on the spiritsof the revolutionaries,  and sinoe  the  Albert Hall Meeting, revolutionary meetingshavo been few.    My correspondent  in Leeds says that the defeatist-rovolution-arios in the West Riding have had  a distinct set-back during tho period of can-vassing,   In the public houses and working  rnen&apos;8 clubs there was satisfaction intho belief that the Coalition Government would  secure a new lease of life.   Onehears remarks such as,  &quot;Well, Lloyd ^eorgo has  got a mandate, and he wanted it now to squash Bolshevism in this country, and ho&apos;ll do it tool&quot;   He also reportsthat Labour men admit rather ruefully  that their personal votes have probably been cancelled by the contrary  vote of their wives.     The sweeping defeat of pacifist and revolutionary candidates, such as W.C.Anderson, Miss Mary MaoArthur,  Mr. Jowett, Mr.  Snowden, Mr. Ramsay Macdonald andothers at the reocnt Election will probably  result in a recrudescence of under-ground revolutionary agitation  for &quot;direct action&quot;, on the plea that the HouseofjConmonB has oeased to represent  the  nation as a whole.     On tho other hand,  in Liverpool and other  parts of Lancashire there is agood deal of discontent, particularly  among  tne women, at the delay indemobilisation.   Most of them  were counting on having their menfolk home for christmas, and they will not listen to the obvious difficulty of demobilising ahuge army all at once before tho War is finished.   At private meetings of theIndependent Labour Party in Lancashire, great hopes are entertained that the cm-ployers will do something which will throw working nen entirely into their hands.They talk Revolution freely, but no-^ne has  yet suggested a plan by whichRevolution is to be brought about.  At a Meeting on the  16th, a young man namedHughes desoribod himself as a Shop Steward and  a Bolshevik, and said that hehad been trying to cduoate his  workmates,  but that they were not suffiently advanced to understand his teaching,   His creed seamed to be purely Syndicalist,   In Manchester, P.H. Kealey,  tho Shop Steward, is trying to form a Workmen!a-Council on the Russian lines, and  thinks that by the Now  Year such a council will be in operation.   He has  been lately in company with  John Moonoy, of thoAmerican Industrial Workers of  the World.     I/ancashire is very muoh exercised about tho question of the weekly hours.Where fifty-three hours a week  are worked, many are in favour of accepting thoemployers&apos; offer of forty-seven hours, but tho Shop Stewards are agitating for aforty hours&apos; week, in the hope  of  getting  forty-four.   At Barrow they are.asking for thirty-five hours,  with tho same  object, and at Liverpool the offer offortv-sovoh hours will bo rejected,  in the hope of getting furty-four.
                                                                                \                                                                       i                                                                       )     The extremists in Ocventry are agitating for non-interference in Russian orGerman internal affairs,   Thoy hope that Bolshevism may succeed in Germany asit has in Russia, because this will bring it a step nearer to England.   Theywbuld like to see unemployment on a large scale in the hope pf fanning the sparkof Bolshevism in England.   One who is intimate with many of them says that aline will soon have to be drawn, but it would be folly to ohallenge them until a decent minimum wage has been fixed.    Give employment and a decent wage *,fhesays, &quot;and there will be no Bolshevism.11     It is^remarkable faot that the extremists of all nations appear to have adopted President Wilson as their protagonist.   He is to find himself, it wouldseen, the champion of British Bolsheviks, of Catalan Separatists, of FrenchMajcritarian Socialists, of Irish Sinn Feiners, of Indian Anarchists, in short,of everyone who has a real or imaginary grievance.     A good many wild rumours are being circulated.   At Birmingham, discharged soldiers have been told that some of their comrades arebeing refused reinstate-ment in their pre-War occupation on the ground that they enlisted without thesanction of their employers.   An unfounded report was oiroulated that theExecutive Committee of the Shcp Stewards, un-ler ^cManus and Watson, were planning to seize the public buildings and large works in Manchester, with a view to bringing about a Revolution.   It has also been stated on third or fourth handevidence that Stavenhagen, of the Electrioal Trades Union, received  500 fromTrotsky a week or two ago.   This is not at all likely.     There is a good deal of unrest in Birmingham on the subjeot of the employ-ment of aliens.   Agricultural labourers are uneasy at the continued employ-ment of German prisoners, and a large body of opinion is against the retentionof Chinese, of whom a thousand are said to be employed in Birmingham.   There isalso some indignation at the demand of landlords for key money before they willlet houses, and this is being used as propaganda.   Twqj British women who have come over as distressed British subjects frcm Russia are reported as beingengaged in Bolshevik propaganda, and one of them is said tc hcve admitted havingreceived money from the Bolsheviks for this purpose.   The matter is being investigated,                                                                                 fra::&apos;     The Majcritaire Socialists are becoming bolder.   ^n the occasion of president Wilson&apos;s reception they organised a procession with red flags - thefirst for some years - and they intend to organize another on the occasion of the presidents return from England.   Monsieur Clemenoeau has certainly been losing .popularity, both with the Troops and the working classes, chiefly owing to the ha.1organisation in the areas lately occupied by the Enemy, where the people are nowworse off for food than they wore when the Germans were in occupation.   MonsieurCleraenoea^s critics say that he can broak a Government, but not make one, andthat he has a most inoompetent Cabinet.   The local Government in the occupiedareas in France certainly compares very unfavourably with that of Belgium,   Onthe whole, whowever, no aotive trouble in France is likely to appear in theImmediate future, and, as far as one can judge at present, Bolshevism is not
likely to make much headway.   Humours are filtering through in ^arls  that  theFrench occupation of Alsace-Lorraine is not regarded by the inhabitants  withunmixed feelings of joy.   An eye-witness of the entry of the Frenoh troops into Metz informs me that a large number of people abstained from the  publicwelcome until they saw that they were likely to bo in the minority,  and  thenthey made the usual -cutward demonstrations,   One reason whioh is given  fortheir uneasiness is that they are, generally speaking, extremely religious,and are afraid of what may happen to their Faith under a Republican and anti-Olerioal regime.     The demobilisation by olassos seems generally to be approved of,  and onthe whole the morale of the French troops, in spite of desertions and  a natural eagerness to bo demobilised is said to be good.     The repatriated French prisoners arriving in Dunkirk appear to be in fairhealth.   They express sympathy for the British, whose sufferings at thehands of the Germans they describe as being greater than their own.     Along the Northern Coast, there is a feeling, not yet amounting to  a movement, whioh may be described as &quot;France for the French,&quot;   The foremostwish is to see tho Belgians back in their own country, especially those  whohave oreated businesses for themselves,   They would be glad also to be  rid of the British, but sinoe they have had to do only with the British soldier,who spends money and mends tho roads, their feeling is far more friendly t*him than to the Belgian civilian.   ,,fJelge&quot; is, in fact, almost a term ofepprebrium.     There has been a deolino in the morale ef the Troops  of all countries,but notably in the British and Amerioan.   The recent disturbance at Havrewas quite nen-politioal. in fact it was little more than a drunken spreearising out of seme unnecessary disoomfort to whioh a number of men of theRoyal Field Artillery were pat.   But there is considerable restlessnessamong most *f the Units whe are not, like the Army Service Corps and theLabour Battalions, employed on hard work, and the men have to be handled withgreat tact.   The Chief 3ouroe of unrest is an imperfect understanding of theconditions of demobilisation,   xf a special effort could  be made to removethis ignorance, it is believed that matters might settle down.     It is thought that a  journal, similar to the  &apos;Stars and Stripes&apos;, pub-lished by the American Army, might be  started at an early  date.   -Articlesexplanatory cf the demobilisation scheme might be issued as appendices te theG,R,0&apos;s for nothing appears to please  the men more than to read Routine OrdersThe American Military Authorities make  use of the ,&apos;Wew  York Herald1 forpublishing offioial information, and pv.iS3ibly something of this kind might also toe done for  our Troops.   The points  that shculd be emphasised are:*    (l) The necessity of maintaining an Army in the Field.    (2) The reasons for taution and delay  in demobilisation,    (3) The estimated periods in which  the  different classes may expect to  be       released.
    (4) The reasons why leave has still to be restricted to a minimum of ten       months.    (5) The reasons why censorship in its modified form has still to be       maintained,     Such information should be issued in language vrhioh oan be understood by  everyone,     The desire for early release is universal,   ^he Americans consider thatwith the Armistice their contract came to an end, and the demobilisation ofthe French Army and the extension of leave for French soldiers has hud its effect.   The men are probably prepared for any delay which for military reasons is inevitable, but owe they knew the military situation to be safe,if  they think that demobilisation is going too slew, it is probable that many will be found to attempt to take it.   They were very much annoyed withthe Authorities for granting twelve days -Christmas leave to men serving inEngland.     Among the American Troops, there is acute nostalgia, and men an? saidto  be deserting in hundreds, not only into Spain and theibaok areas inFranco, but actually into Germany, and these deserters are not of Gormanblood.     Among the newspaper correspondents that have ocme over for tho ^eaoeCongress is the negro, Dubois, who succeeded Booker Washington at theTuskegee College.   This man is Editor of the &quot;Crisis&quot;, a paper devoted tosuggestions of armed risings of Blaoks against Whites,   Immediately onhis arrival in Paris he obtained leave to visit the Black Division at theFront.   This Division is being very rapidly demobilised, and Dubois&apos;prcoeedings are being carefully watched.   He is a man of great intelleotualoapacity, as is shown by his bocka,                                                                             THE PROGE                                                                             OF BOLSHEI                                                                               GERMANY,     The present position appears to be that the Spartacus Group has succeeded in seiz:the exeotitive power in Berlin.   It was already predominant in Hamburg, Kiel and BremeHow far Bolshevik principles will radiate from Berlin no one can foretell, but it isdifficult to believe that there will not be a reaction in Souti Germany and the RhineProvinces, or that the German people as a whole, with their love of organisation andgood order, will tamely submit to a Bolshevik regime on the Russian plan,  , At the premoment, the prospect of having a stable Central Government to deal with in the Peacenegotiations is not good.       There is undoubted evidenoe to show that a systematic attempt to corrupt the mcof  the Allied Troops in occupation is being made.   The German Legations in CopenhagenThe Hague, and Berne have been left untouohed, both in personnel ani in policy.   they appear to think that their best chance cf saving something from the wreck is to provokBolshevik disturbances in the Allied oountries, and to this end they are printing and employing returned prisoners as agents to go among the Trocps and incite them todepose their officers,   Agent3 have also been taken on for service in England and Fr
 l&apos;aey are ospecially aotive  among  the American Troops  of  occupation, and it is perhaps significant that a considerable number  of Americans are  reported to have deserted into Germany,   Jhese may perhaps be merely men tfho are  determined to eaoape from military discipline at all  hazards and  who have taken the line of least resistance %m &apos; the hopes of seouring a passage home to America.       Besides the German souroe of propaganda, there  is  another stream flowing from Russia.    These agents are  for the most part returned prisoners of war, well supplied with money and passes and leaflets on Bolshevik principles.   The chief Bolshevik organ for propaganda in the BVelt Revolution&quot;, published weekly in several languages under the auspices of the International Federation;   the Editor of the edition in English  is Philips Price, formerly correspondent  of the  &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;.       The munition works are still busy for eight hours  a day, the hands working four hours and loafing four hours,  For the last four hours  they are paid 75$ of their ordinary wage.   The  general impression in  Berlin  is that the return of the troops will at first strengthen the foroes of order,  but that if they remain in Berlin they will become infected  with Bolshevism; at  present  they show no tendencies in that  direction,4ARK,       The attempt of the syndicalists to bring.about  a general strike on november 13th having failed, the Social Democratic Party has issued a  programme of reforms, and has, through  its organ ^he Social Democrat&apos;.  Called upon  the working classes to remain orderly.   There is no immediate  danger of a Bolshevik disturbance in that oountry,TZERLAND.r       Revolutionary deserters in Zurich have already, organised a Spartacus  Group and are in communication with Haase and liobknooht.  The German Gonsul haB been instructed to give passes to those who are willing to go to Berlin to serve under Haase,       The Government enquiry into the recent disturbances has resulted in the  deter- mination to expel eighteen Bolsheviks and fifteen Italian anarohists,       A number of Swi3B Socialists are reported to believe that there  is already disorder in England.   Generally speaking, they are not in favour of violence, believing that propaganda among the peasants and workmen will be more effective.HOE,       Bolshevism does not appear to be making muoh progress in Franoe  in spite of the fact that Mo3imann, chief of the Berne Polioe a germanophile, is believed to be issuing false Swiss papers to agents working for the Central Powers,   An Italian deserter named Adolfo Sismondo stated that-while in Paris a fowlfoeks ago he attended the Bolshevik meeting at the Hotel Suisae, 5, Rue de la Huohette, convened  for deciding on the propitious moment for starting revolution in Franoe and Italy.   The meeting was attended by sixteen revolutionaries inoluding Charbrieresr the  proprietor^pf the Hotel Suisso, and Morgari, the Italian Socialist Deputy, who visited Englandm few months ago.   There was a difference of opinion as to whether the move should be mado on the signature of the Armistice or after the signature of Peace, and the meeting showed that thoro was distrust between the revolutionaries thomsolvos.
