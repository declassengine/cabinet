        &apos;i;&quot;;i\!OR&apos;&apos;N])UM BY G^RiiL STAFF,   AR  OFFICE ON THE        PROFO^D WCHMG1? OF GIFR/WR &quot;OB  C\JTA OR c0 E        0TP&apos;&quot;R  WOPTH AFFIC.-,N PORT,      i      Tha  exchange of Gibraltar has been  3Upvested because  it has  become militarily indefensible owing to&quot;the development of modern  weapons.      In 1901  Lord Roberts stated  that he came to the  conclusion &quot;that it  would   be practically impossible to defend Gibraltar from a  Land  attack unless we  v,3re prepared at the  first sound of war being imminent to land 30,000 or  40,000  men and seize the  commanding heights on the &quot;e;;t and  North&apos;1.      The  same opinion -was olearly expressed in the Minutes of the 77th Meeting  of the Committee of  Imperial  Defence in  1905 of which  the  following is an extract      &quot;Against a land attack by Spain  and France in combination      no  infantry force  ?rhich could be maintained in  the fortress^      woulcT suTfibe.   Such on attack could be op/osed only &quot;by&quot;&quot;      an&quot;expedlTTonflry force large enough  to  occupy and hold the      surrounding Spanish territory&quot;*      Since these views vere expressed, the adverse conditions*have been  accentuated by the rapid development of artillery,  and by the  development of aircraft.      Against  attack from the air, the defence is a difficult matter  both on account of the proximity  of possible hostile air bases and  also of the concentrated targets afforded,  owing to the limited space available  on the Rock.   &quot;This latter limitation also renders  it unsuitable1 as a base  for aircraft, which may well prove an  important factor in the  control of the Straits in the future.      It may be argued that vulnerability to attack from the air would not  be  felt unless Spain were hostile.    This however may not  be  the same in the future &quot;&quot;hen air attacks can be carried out from distant  bases.      Before considering  alternatives  for Gibraltar, it will be as well to formulate the requirements which they should  fulfil.      Gibraltar has been  retained  and  ir  still required not for military  purposes at  all, but as  a naval base from which to control the Straits,  and also as  a Coaling Station for both Naval and  commercial traffic.    Any harbour, therefore, which it is proposed  should tat-e  the place of Gibraltar,  must be  suitable for these purposes;   the  only military qualifications requisite are that it shall be defensible,  and  that without requiring an excessive  garrison.      From  the Admiralty  point of  view it is apparently Immaterial whether the Naval Forces  controlling  the -traits are  based on the European or African  Coasts,  provided  the requisite facilities exist (vide Admiralty letter&quot;to foreign  Office dated  October 31st, Appendix A).      The  port of Ceuta has been usually  suggested as  the best alternative for Gibraltar,  but R in con-del-&apos;&apos;-edik is another possible site, at least for the Naval Dockyard.      &apos;&quot;hether  either  or both of these  ^eve  chosen the  conditions as regards  land defence,  would be  much i,ho  same since  the proximity (15  miles)  of these  places to each other would render the  occupation of one  of  them by a hostile  ,,ower a danger to the other;  hence any  scheme  of deforce against ser ous attach  should include both.      These  ports would be liable  to bombardment and attack from
 land  in  a  war  either  w1th  France  or Spain,  or of course with both  combined.    Tf Spain  were  hostile  Ceuta  could be bombarded from  the north  side of  the Straits, and. the sa--e ma;; apoly in a  few years  to  Rincon-dei-&apos;-ledilc,  but no thin&apos;-  like so effectively as  Gibraltar would be in similar  c.ir-cu&apos;istanoes*    Equally Gibraltar  if in enemy hands  could be broupht  under our fire from  the African Coast, the  advantage eventually resting with  that  side  which  has tbe superiority in the  air, and on the sea      As regards attack  from  the vfrican side,  the Spanish Colonial Army,  in t&apos;&quot;0 /resent state of  Spanish 1 orocco, cannot be regarded  as  a  &quot;Teat  dnnror*    Lat-ir  on,  however,  with improved railway communications in   orocco, a  French or Franco- Spanish Army with its base in North vfrlca  and independent.  at least for  a  t?me, of  sea communications,,  might constitute a considerable threat-,    But as lohp.  na we  hold  command of the sea no hostile  o/erat&quot;5 ons  in N. Africa  can  possibly  threaten us as much as similar ones on Spanish territory  against Gibraltar.      Though, therefore  t^e problem  fill always be far simpler than  in the  case  of the defence of  Gibraltar,  where  the enemy would have secure lines of coinmunicati on  beyond  the  reach tff our sea power,  the scheme  of defence for  Oeuta area  must be framed to  meet  such p contingency eventually,     The^ requirements of such defence are :- (a)   The  occupation  of any  ground  which  ,.ives observation      over  Ceuta and Rinqpn-del-Wedik.    The line  fulfilling      these conditions i  shown  in ;.reen on  the attached map.     The ma.in defence must obviously not  be inside this line0 (b)   The  denial  to an  enemy of positions from which the     harbours can be  shelled by heavy artillery.   Without     extending  the defence to an&apos;  impracticable extent,  it is      impossible to comply  rith  this  requirement  even as regards     lonp ranme artillery  already existing, and  still more so     with regard  to future developments *    This  of course applies     with  greater force to Rinc.on-del-iV.edik then  to  Ceuta.     Bombardment  at extreme  ranyes  is however  useless without     -ood  observation unless a-a inst a  larpe  objectiveq    This     danger  can  therefore  be best nullified,  or  at any rate,     reduced, by  ood air-defence and suitable dispersion of     vulnerable tarpets. (c)   The  acquirinp of  sufficient pround  in front of the  main     line  of defence  to provide for  advanced positions  and     future developments.     The minimum to  fulfil these conditions    - is probably  piven by  a  line  from the Tanpier boundary     passing S. of Tetuan, approximately  as shown in blue     on map.     The best main defence lino would probably be  s  marked  in-red, while  tbe  immediate defence  of  Ceuta would be assured  toa certain  extent b^ a line throurh  A?es Fill as shown  in brown.

10.        A garrison sufficient to hold the Brovn line would no      doubt protect Ceuta itself against any attack by Spain uncbr      present conditions.   ^or this it is considered that 4      Battalions of Infantry with the necessary technical troops      would suffice.           Plans would, however, have to b.j. vork d out for holding      the Red. line in certain eventualities and lat r, t,ossibly,      preparations actually made.   In any case the territory within      the Blue line should he acquired in the first instance.   This      would constitute a valuabl  training /founcl, though &quot;In the firsl      place t^e tribes inhabit in- it vould have to be brou ht under      control.11.        There are  no doubt other advantages, political rather than      military in acquirin;  a footing on the African coast, amongst      which may be ventioned the possibility of controlliix  the      African end of  any future cross-Straits Tunnel.  .IP.        Conclusions.      (1)   So Ion;&apos; as Spsin remains neutral Gibraltar is more           easily defensible than a port on the African Coast, beinf           exposed only to attack by sea and air.      (2)   If Spain is hostile the harbour of Gibraltar is indefensi-           ble by any troops which can be maintained there arai^at           attack from the land.      (3)   A base in the vicinity of Ceuta provided it has an           adequate hinterland will always be far  more defeasible           than Gibraltar, so Ion;/ as we have command of the sea.      (4)   As regards the air a base in Africa would have ;reat           advantages over Gibraltar in all circumstances.13.        It mi^ht happen no doubt that c more thorou^i enquiry by      the Admiralty into the possibilities of Ceuta and Rincon-del-      ;&apos;&apos;3dik would lead to a  change of opinion as to their nev^r bein^      likely to become suitable to fulfil their minimum requirements.      In that case the overwhelming military advantages enumerated      above would doubtless  render an exchange desirable.

It  Owing to the confined limits of the fortress  of          Gibraltar,  it is especially vulnerable to attack by          aircraft and although it is not considered that the          defences of the fortress would  be destroyed by this          method of attack, its communications could be          severed.      2.  Further, the small accommodation available for an          aerodrome precludes any possibility of concentrating          any large force of aircraft at  Gibraltar; and the          nature of the ground is responsible for gusty and          treacherous currents of air which makes flying          difficult.      3.  On the other hand.,  there is land for aerodrome          accommodation at Oeuta, the nature of the our-          rounding country gives sufficient room for aerJAfli          manoeuvre,  and the port of Ceuta afforCs facilities          for defence from aerial raids.                                 I am                                     Sir,                                 Your obedient Servant,                                  (Sgd.)   W.A. ROBINSON. Secretary,War Office.

COTIOTTIAL.Sir,        With rgforonoo to your lot tor 152828/W.G, of the16th ultimo, my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty havehsd under consideration tho naval aspects of a suggestedexchange of Gibraltar for Couta, and desire that the following observations may be laid before the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.  1.    Prom tho point of viow of exorcising a controlover tho atr&amp;lts, which is the naval strategicalaspect of exchanging Gibraltar for Ceuta, it isimmaterial whether the naval forces exorcising that control are based on the European or African coast,Hovi&amp;oj- the harbour is ocjJ* ^^or ^bo pur-poio.&quot;  Similarly &quot;from&quot;&quot; the point of viow of a coalingstation for naval or commercial traffic either in pescoor in war, there is nothing tc ohooso between the Northand South sides provided&apos; the anchorages and coalingfacilities are equally good,  2.    Eo harbour which is ever likely to be built atCeuta or the vicinity can make such a good anchorageas Gibraltar Harbour and Bay, because the poninsala isthe only land on either side of tho Straits whichaffords any real snelter from the easterly winds orLevanters,  These winds blow on an average 16(5 days intho year with such force that they must be speciallyconsidered both as regards the actual construction andthe use of the harbour after completions   It is doubt-ful whether any scheme of harbour works on the african coast can provide a perfectly- satisfactory entrancefor large ships during a Levanter.  3.    Alternative plans for the construction of asuitable naval and mercantile harbour on tho Africanside of the btraits havo been examined,- and tho general conclusion is that it would be a difficult and costlyundertaking, but that no final opinion can bo offeredon the success of such plans without a very comprehensivestudy of the problem on the spot which would hovo toinclude borin:s.  4.    The main military argument, for tho exchange ofCeuta and Gibraltar, is understood to be that in theevent of a war with opain the latter could bo mado un-tenable by gunfire;  but by the time this war material-izos - if it ever does - the progress of land artillery and aircraft may have made this equally true of Couta,which is only 12 miles from the Spanish Coast,        It must also be rememberod that in years to cornoMorocco may be garrisoned by hostile military forcesund, in thet oaso, it would only bo possible to holdCouta by occupying the surrounding country with a strongarmy. -Thus the very reasons ior which it is proposedto abandon Gibraltar may in the future equally applyto Coutaa
  5.    From the naval point of view, therefore, theexchange of Gibraltar for Ceuta, so far as can bo seenat present, would be a loss strategically andcommercially.  The only naval justification for suchan exchange would be the completion of a harbour on the african coast affording as safe and extensive ananchorage ss Gibraltar,  and an undertaking from Spainnot to fortify Gibraltar,     I cm,         oir,Your obedient  Servant,   (Signed)  W-P JIIQH0L80N.The Under  Secretary of State,        FOREIGN OFFICE.
