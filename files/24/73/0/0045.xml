(THIS DO croon1  is  TEE PROPERTY UP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ).f,1 5 C RET.IJ. 6645.\f             WAR CABINET.PROPOSED TEIEGRArH COMUNIOATICN3 i&quot;BOARD,  (Memorandum by the postmaster-General),  1.  The Telegraph Communications Board advocated in lord milner&apos;s memorandum (G.T.6449),  doe a not differ in essentialsfrom the cables (Landing Rights)  Committee  which has existed for the past 18 years to advise  upon Cable  questions andlatterly upon V/irelesB policy also.  I  agree  that an Interde-departmental Board of this character with an  enlarged scope isnecessary and that its functions should be  advisory and notexecutive.  2.  The Cables (Landing Rights)  Committee has hithertoreported to the Board of Trade,   Some time  ago  Sir A. Stanleyinformed me that he wished to be relieved of  this Committee,the functions of which he considered were more  appropriate tothe post Office than to the Board of Trade, and I agreed totake it over.  3.  The Pest Office is responsible to parliament fortelegraph and telephone communication within  the UnitedKingdom, for cable communication with other oountries,  so faras it is ocntrolled by Government, and for  the  control  of wireless Telegraphy for all except naval and  military pur-peses.  It will probably fall to the post office to takeexecutive action on most of the  recommendations of the telegraph Communications Board and, in my  pinion,  it wouldbe sound in principle and convenient in practice that the beard should be attached to the  Post office and should  reportto the postmaster General.  The  reports would,  as at present,be circulated to all Departments concerned  for  information and any necessary action.  4,  An alternative suggestion  has since been  made by  theAdmiralty that the Board should  be subordinated to theGommittee of Imperial Defence, which, is apparently seleotedas a &quot;neutral department&quot;.  This suggestion seems toindicate divergence between commercial and strategio rea,uire-mente which has not occurred in the past and  is not likelyto eccur in the future,  moreover, if civil and military policy were in conflict, I should not have  considered theDefence Committee a neutral department for the  purpose  ofadjudicating between them.  5.  The end of the war will probably stimulate demands for the improvement and cheapening of our communications, andthe work of the Board is likely to bo concerned principallywith commercial and scientific development and.questions  of.foreign and imperial policy.  The list of subjects enumerated in paragraph 13 of the Admiralty memorandum seems to support this view.  No one would underrate the importance of Navaland Military interests in problems of communications, whichwould be adequately safeguarded by the representatives  on
 the Board of the Admiralty,  War Office and Air Ministry,   But I suggest it would he mistaken policy to attach a Committee deal in* principally with commercial questions to the  Defence Committee which is mainly concerned with Naval and Military policy.   6.  I am opposed to the distinction indicated hy the pro- posal to designate some membera of the Board &quot;permanent&quot;,  viz * those nominated hy the War office,  Admiralty,  Air Ministry and Post Office,  and others &quot;advisory&quot; or &quot;non-permanent&quot;  viz. those nominated hy the Colonial Office.,  Foreign Office.  India Office, Treasury and Board cf Trade,   All the Departments.represented should have an equal voice and the same status- Some cf the questions referred to the Board may not concern them all &quot;but this applies no less to  those whose nominees  are &quot;permanent&quot; than to those whose nominees arc &quot;advisory&quot;  cr&quot;non permanent&quot;.       Having regard to the wide interests involved,  I  should not regard a Board,  the permanent personnel of which  comprises three representatives of the fighting services and one repre- sentative of a  civil Department,  as sufficiently represeiita- tive,  and if there wore any  conflict  between civil and. military views,  which, as I have already said,need not  he anticipated, the composition of the Board would be open to  criticism,   7,   Whether the Dominions  set up similar Boards seems a matter for the  several Governments themselves  to decide. It  is desirable  that ,there should he  some representative of the Dominion Governments in  London who would he authorised, to represent them  for this purpose.   Possibly they would  he willing to nominate  the High Commissioner,  or  some officer acting on his behalf,  to attend the meetings of the Board when summoned.  In any case this  question  siigh&apos;t he  deferred until the Board is  constituted.;   8.   If  the modifications suggested  above are  accepted, the - necessary machinery  is ready to hand  and there  is  no reason why the Board should not he  set up  immediately.                                   (Sgd.)  . ALBERT Ha ILLIIGWORTH.10th January, 1919.
