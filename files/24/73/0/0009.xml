JM&amp;^JVIENT  IS THE Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]CV^FIDENTIAL.[December 31, 1918.]Political Intelligence Department,          Foreign Office.                      Germany/026.THE  GERMAN COLONIES AND GERMAN  SOCIALISM.    SINCE the memorandum on  &quot;The German Colonies and  Popular Feeling  inGermany &quot; was circulated,  the number  of the weekly organ of the Social-Democratparty, &quot; Die Neue Zeit,&quot; for November 22 has reached the department.  It contains anarticle entitled &quot; Kolonialpolitik und Arbeiterschaft &quot; (&apos;&apos; Colonial Policy and Labour&quot;),by A. Runde, vvhicli corroborates  the statements and inferences  of that memorandum.    it appears worth while to  translate the article as a  supplementary paper,  inview of the fact that it was composed after the armistice  terms  of the Allies had beenaccepted,  and appeared on  November 22  in one of the principal  Socialist - organs.One may infer (1.)  that the  replacement  of the old regime  by  a Socialist government does not mean that the demand for a colonial empire will be dropped.  One  may alsogather (2) the  hind  of  arguments  by which the  demand will be  pressed unless,  ofcourse, the events  which have taken place since November 22, or  which take place before the German negotiators meet the representatives of the Allies at the Conferencetable have made any such demand obviously hopeless.                     COLONIAL POLICY AND LABOUR.    The new Government of  Germany has been obliged  to accept the hard armistice conditions of the Entente.  Soon peace negotiations will follow, in which the demandsput forward by the Allied Powers are  not likely to be a whit less hard.  One of themost difficult tasks which will confront our negotiators at the Conference table will beto obtain  from  England and  France the  return of the German African  colonies.True, Wilsons peace  programme does not contain  any demand  to  the  effect that german colonial  dominions  are  to  pass  into  English hands.  Nevertheless,  it is certain that the  British  Government  will resist to  the utmost  any suggestions thatit should  give  up German East Africa and  South-West  Africa.   The propaganda campaign  against  alleged  German  atrocities  in the  colonies  has  been  got up byEngland for no other purpose than that of giving her pretensions to German colonial territory a kind of moral justification.    The attitude of the German working class to the colonial  question had changedmore and more,  even  in the  last  years preceding  the  world-war.    Under theinfluence of war  experiences  and of  the  English efforts to unite Great  Britain withits colonies in one economic  league, and to make it harder for German industries,even when the war is over, to procure raw  materials from overseas, this change has proceeded further.  That  the Social-Democrat  party formerly took up  to the colonialquestion an attitude essentially different from its present one is quite understandablein view of the differences  in the political  and  industrial  situation then and to-day.Besides, the  Social-Democrat party was  by no  means alone in its  opposition to a colonial policy.   We  need only point out  the general  &quot; colonial weariness&quot; in theseventies of the  last century.  Bismarck, as well as Caprivi, were always cold withregard to  the colonial question.   When it was suggested to  Bismarck in 1871, on theoccasion of  the  peace negotiations, that he should annex the  French colonies, hedeclined to  do so.   Again in 1875 he declined to  annex  Samoa.   At that time hewrote to Roon :          &quot; The expenditure involved in the  foundation, the upkeep, and especially the     defence of colonies is  very often in excess of the good  which the mother-country     derives from  them, as the colonial  experience of  England  and France  shows,     quite apart  from the consideration that it  is scarcely a justifiable  procedure to     subject the whole nation to heavy burdens in  taxation for the benefit of a few     branches of trade  and industry.  England has been  led  by her experiences in     this  line to  abandon her colonial policy, and France also  seems  to attach little     value to the foundation of  new colonies.  For the North German Federation,     whose system of military defence rests  upon the universal duty of military service,     there is an especial difficulty in the fact that it cannot reasonably be represented       [367-55]                                                        B
     as implied in this duty that those who serve by obligation should be employed  for     long periods  as  garrisons  in tropical  countries.  Besides  that, I  altogether     subscribe to the view that our  navy is not yet sufficiently developed to be able     to undertake the task oi effectively protecting far-away States.&quot;     It was only tentatively, towards the end  of the seventies, that Bismarck went asfar as the conclusion of a treaty for trade and amily with Tonga and Samoa.  Capriviwas no  less cautious in  his colonial  policy.   Both  feared  provoking the rivalry ofEngland.  Yet in England itself in the seventies opinion was very much divided as tothe value of colonies.  Gladstone had represented tho abandonment of a colonial policy as imminent.   Gold win Smith declared  that a British  colonial empire was a positivedanger   for  England.  This  certaintly  did   not   deter   British  statesmen  fromappropriating new colonies all over the world, nor cause them to  remit  their efforts toinvalidate the claims of other Powers to colonial territory, or to get in before them.     It was not made exactly easy for the German people in those days to acquire anyardour for colonial policy.  This applies to a  wide extent even to  bourgeois circles.The red  tape and bureaucratic methods, which  had been planted in the colonies fromthe  very  outset, were  anything but calculated  to have an  encouraging effect.   Theabominations committed  by people like Leist, Wehlau, and Arenberg are still fresh inmen&apos;s  minds.  They even shocked  those circles  upon whose sympathy so muchdepended the  capitalist  circles.   The  fact that these circles  hung  back,  throughdeficient confidence, from furnishing the capital required  for the economic advance ofthe colonies was significant, and could not  fail to influence the rest of the public.     Again, the internal conditions of Germany were not of a kind to direct men&apos;s eyesto distant countries.   The task  of settling men on the land at  home seemed  of  more immediate concern.   No wonder  that the working  classes grudged all  the moneysunk in  the colonies.   The risk  of  conflicts  with  other Powers entailed in  theacquisition of colonies was  another thing  which confirmed them in  their  negative attitude.     At the International Socialist Conference in Stuttgart (1907) the whole  complex of considerations which, according to  the view then prevalent  amongst Socialists, made against a colonial policy were summed up in the following resolution :          &quot; The Congress is of  the  opinion that capitalistic colonial policy by its very     nature is bound to  lead to the  enslavement,  subjection to forced 1 labour, and     extermination of  the native  population of  colonial  territories.  The civilising    . mission, which  capitalist  society  adduces,  serves  only as  a cover  for  lusts     directed  to conquest and exploitation.    It is not  till  a  Socialist  society is     established that all peoples will be given the possibility of developing  themselves     to  complete civilisation.  Capitalistic colonial  policy, far from increasing  the     total strength of the community, destroys the natural wealth of the countries into     which it introduces  its  methods, by reducing the  natives to slavery and misery,     as well as  by devastating  wars.  In this way it retards or prevents by its own     action Tie development of  trade and of the market for the products of  industry.     The Congiess condemns the barbarous methods of capitalistic colonisation, and, in     the  interests  of the development of productive powers, demands a  policy which     guarantees peaceful cultural development, and makes the riches of the soil  available     for the whole of mankind, to serve the purposes of their higher development.   It     confirms  anew  the resolution of the Paris Congress (1900) and of the Amsterdam     Congress (1904) on  the colonial question, and once more  repudiates  the present     methods of colonisation, which, capitalist in their essence, have no other object but     to  conquer alien countries and  subjugate  alien peoples in order to exploit them     unmercifully for the benefit  of a  vanishing minority, whilst at the same time it    - increases the burdens of the proletariat at home.          &quot; As the enemy of all exploitation of human beings by each other, as  the     defender of all the  oppressed without distinction of race, the Congress condemns     this policy  of robbery and conquest, which is nothing but a shameless application     of the right of the stronger, and treads under foot the rights of conquered peoples.          &quot; Colonial  policy increases the risk  of warlike  complications  between  the     colonising States, and aggravates their burdens, military and naval.          &quot; From the financial point of  view, expenditure  for colonial ends, both that     which imperialism entails and  that which is applied to  the economic development     of the colonies, ought  to be  borne by those who alone draw profit  from  the     pillaging of alien countries, and whose riches are derived from that source.
         &quot; In  conclusion, the  Congress declares that  Socialist  representatives  are    bound by duty to combat implacably in all Parliaments the methods of merciless    exploitation and enslavement which prevail in all existing colonies.         &quot; For this purpose they must support reforms in order to improve the lot of    the natives;  they must oppose every violation of the fights  of the  natives, their    exploitation and enslavement; and they must work  by all means at their disposal    for their education to independence.&quot;    In form discussion followed the lines indicated by these points, but it soon became evident that it was not always  possible  to  take  them  strictly in practice.  In  themeantime colonial  activity had,  as a matter  of fact,  struck  out other paths.   Thecapital invested, which had  grown  meanwhile to over 500,000,000 marks, had to be safeguarded if it was not to be thrown away.  The methods of colonisation becamenot only more humane, but more  remunerative, and the influence of Social  Democracyin this process could not be  overlooked.  Civilising tasks came, hesitatingly at first,more  and  more  into the foreground,  and furnished counterweights to  the barelycapitalist interests.    Colonial conditions  at the outbreak of war had thus,  after that first period of&quot; infantile  diseases,&quot; become relatively healthy.   Whilst the  judicial system  was based on native law customary law, of  course which, however defective it might be,still represented an important beginning, the administration was ordered on the rationalprinciples  proper to civil administration, and strove as  far as possible, though  not always as successfully as might  have been wished, to emancipate itself from the evils ofbureaucracy.  The financial administration aimed at keeping clear of exploiting andinhumane  measures and  setting the colonies financially on  their  feet.  This  hadalready been  achieved  in the  case of  Togoland and Samoa.  Economic  policy was based on the principle of the open  door, free trade, &quot; international competition onan equal footing and freedom for industry and settlement&quot;; economic  impediments, inthe shape  of  concessions and  monopolies, were no longer  permitted.   The german colonies did not  even admit those  preferential arrangements to which all the other colonial  Powers,  except Holland, adhered,  apart  from  certain  small  export duties which fiscal requirements rendered necessary.    In the humanitarian direction German colonial policy in diametrical  contrast tothe English colonial policy, which is wholly shaped  by the consideration of gain hadbeen active, though up to that time, it must be  admitted, with but mediocre success.Germany had taken the  lead in  the  movement for preventing the import of spirits,arms, and ammunition.   The resistance  of other colonial Powers  unhappily preventedthis movement from attaining full success.    The German Empire helped  towards the  carrying out of this economic policy by subsidies to shipping lines, and thereby  promoted the quickening, not only of Germancolonial  trade, but also of foreign  trade  generally.   In  1895, for  instance,  theWoermann line had only five steamers, with a total of 12,745 gross tonnage for trafficwith  Africa.  By  1914  their shipping had  reached a total of twenty-nine steamers(145,000 gross  tonnage), ten  coasting steamers,  nine steam  tugs,  eight  barques,152 lighters and smaller craft.  The Deutsch-Ostafrika line began in  19o0 with sevenlake steamers  (13,600  gross tonnage).   In  1914  it had twenty-three steamers  with110,000 gross tonnage working.   Similarly, traffic, in the interior was increased by theconstruction of roads and railways and the erection of  stations for internal navigation.Thus the length of railroad laid down at the end of 1913 had reached 4,179 kilometres,as against 1,350 kilometres in 1906.   If the war had not compelled these efforts  to be suspended, the completion of  railways already in  construction or sanctioned wouldhave  brought  the figures up  to 5,113 kilometres  mainlines and 178*7 kilometresbranch lines.  It must be emphasised that all this construction was carried out underthe supervision of white engineers, without any corvee or forced labour being imposedupon the natives,  the  regulations  for  native labour  issued for the several  colonialdistricts being  faithfully observed.  The postal and telegraph services  were alsoexemplary, in part even  better organised  than in  the Russian Empire.   Whilst  theten-pfennig postage had been maintained for letters directed to places in the colony orto  the  mother-country,  it  had  been  possible  to  establish 187   post-offices  and2,027 telephone stations.  The  length of wires was abont 14,600 kilometres.     The principles to be kept in  view in all this work  of developing communicationswere stated in 1913 by the Colonial Secretary  [Soil&apos;] as follows:          &quot; A  good financial return  is  something very  nice, but it is  no sort  of  a   , criterion whether the railway fulfils its purpose.   To determine that,  the amount       [367-55]                                                     B 2
      of traffic is the thing which counts.  Traffic is the most trustworthy index of the      development of economic  life.  Brisk  traffic means  economic prosperity, and to      promote economic development  is what  the railway is there for.  Whatever is      sacrificed in indirect [? direct] financial returns, is abundantly made up for by the      general economic development.   When the  railways have come to maturity in      respect of traffic, then indeed, but  not till then, they ought  to be, and must be,      self-supporting, and cover expenditure in interest,  sinking  funds, and  running      expenses.  It  is to this that we should adjust the tariff.   We must fix it, not      according to the present amount of business, but the future.&quot;      The improvement of the sanitary service was also among the tasks which  German colonial  administration set before itself.   In the  first  beginnings this  had  been neglected, with the consequence that a high native and infant mortality set in.   Here wholly new paths had  to be entered upon after scientific enquiry.  Tropical  diseases were inyestigated with great thoroughness.  If this was required for the protection of the white population  in the first instance, the efforts to improve  general hygienic conditions rapidly redounded to the good of the natives.  Desolating  diseases-malaria (to which natives are just as subject as  Europeans, the children especially), smallpox, dysentery, typhus, leprosy, plague, yellow  fever,  syphilis, &amp;c. which  had hitherto, owing  to the  lack of  all  medical assistance, carried off thousands of natives,  were systematically  fought,  and  the  natives  thus benefited by an assistance  which  they could get only from  a higher civilisation.  Hospitals arose with trained staffs; for the most part medical help and nursing were given gratis ;  a  travelling clinical service was established ; provision  was made for instruction in hygiene,  &amp;c.  The measures taken agninstthe sleeping sickness alone-that scourge of the African native-were  a great work of culture, indissolubly connected with the name of German medical science, all the more that neither the French nor the  Belgians had  taken  any steps to combat the  malady.   Even  leper asylums were  erected and thousands of lepers  isolated, in order to obviate the risk of  general contagion.     But there  were  other branches of German science which had done great things at the time when the war  began.   Apart from the activity of  pure research in the matter (f ethnology,  natural science and geography, general  scientific exploration, not only  of  the  German colonies,  but of practically  the  whole of  Africa, had gone on, especially with regard  to economic potentialities.  Geological research, for instance, which comprised the examination of soils  and  the  discovery of available strata  of useful minerals and  other  raw  materials, had  already had  good  results,  with large promise for the future.   Meteorological observations had been established.   Zoologists and botanists  were  zealously at work, both in the interests of pure science and in order that the opening out of colonial regions might proceed  on scientific data.   These last  activities  especially had  contributed  not a little  to  practical cultivation.  If formerly the native, according to his primitive  grade of culture, had  mainly depended upon his mere industry in gathering what he needed from bush and forest, if at the beginning of the colonial era barter in self-grown products, collected in a wasteful and improvident way and delivered  at the  factories, was  still the predominant form of trade, the practical institutions of plantations under European direction soon followed. This seemed at first opposed to the freedom of the natives.  Yet  the European  also is under  compulsion to do regular work if he is to  live.   Courses of  instruction,experimental stations, an agricultural service, &amp;c, were established in order to educate the natives that was the object in view to  methodical agricultural production.   Theresults were very promising.  In 1913 the areas already planted were as follows : Colony.	Total Area Planted in Hectares.	Cocoa.	Rubber.	Cocoa Palms.	Sisal.	Coffee.	Cottou.

In 1914  there existed  four
institutes of a scientific and practical character, nine experimental stations for  specialbranches (seven for cotton, two for tobacco cultivation), two for corn-growing.  Therewere also stations for stock-rearing.  Thanks to these measures, the export of vegetableand  animal  products  rose  between  1890 and  1912  something  like 778  per cent.,between 1900 and  1912 about 400 per cent. ;  in figures, from  7,800,000 marks in189(5 to 13,200,000 marks in 1900, and 60,700,000 in 1912-only a small fraction, it istrue, compared with the total German trade in raw materials and food-stuffs, yet a promising advance which justified good hopes for the future.    Finally, one may mention  the educational work, which  was likewise activelycarried on  and continuously extended.  The difficulties, one must clearly realise, are by no means small climate, shyness of the natives,  distances between the  severalsettlements, lack of roads, &amp;c, all these  constitute  great impediments.  -Nevertheless,the sums expended  give a good idea of the policy consistently followed.    The sums expended on schools were:-	1910.	1911.	1912.	1913.	1914.East Africa Cameroons Togoland South- West Africa Samoa New Guinea Total	192,888 158,854 85,879 269.855 49,612 46,601	202,898 151,210 62.471 381,486 54,945 63,928	237,777 138,220 66,5S9 493.428 58,6:57 83,765	259,780 238,120 71,959 543,428 59,137 95,065	401,180 326,&apos; 00 86,900 616,sl0 72,385 155,000	803,689	916,938	1,078,386	1,267,489	1,658,375    In  the days before the war it was a favourite catch-phrase that the  workers asa class  have only  a direct  interest in such things,  since  capitalist interests  and working-class interests are not identical.  In many respects, perhaps  in most respects,that is true ;  but it is no less certain that the  two classes have some  not unimportantinterests in common.   In fine, in everything a kind of compromise  has to be come to,if all effort is not to remain negative.    We have such  community of interests where the question at issue is to see  thatscope for  work  all  round  exists.  Upon  this rests the national economic system,national well-being,  supply of  the means of nourishment, and, in the last resort, thegeneral  level of  culture.  In  our  case, what  we have  to determine is whether thebalance of  national economy  would be disturbed, if those particular  industries whichdepend  exclusively or mainly upon tropical raw materials were eliminated or prevented from working to their full capacity.  Such  dependence upon colonial products exists in the case of many of our .most important branches of industry.   Now, supposing toecould have  security that the market for colonial raw materials would in future be  opento all countries on equal terms, that the mother-country would  be given no preferentialadvantage  over  other countries, we  might  perhaps  waive our demand to have  firmpossession  of the German colonies.  But where are such conditions offered ?  And inthis connection it is by  no means always simply a question of a customs tariff giving a preference to  the mother-country.  The industries of foreign countries can always beput at a disadvantage, as  against those of the mother-country, by the introduction ofparticular harbour and  warehouse privileges, special facilities for export and transport,direct or indirect support  of  private rings  and associations for  the production orpurchase of  raw materials.  It is  therefore certainly untrue to say that Germany&apos;industrial population has no interest in Germany&apos;s possession of colonies.  Just becausethey have an interest in home industries remaining able  to compete and expand, it is their interest to see that it is not made more  difficult  for these industries to procurecolonial raw materials than it is for other countries.     The absolutely negative attitude  which  the Social-Democrat  party  at  one timetook up towards the colonial question is thus no longer justified.  This is  not to  denythat there was a good deal in the. earlier German  colonial policy to  which exceptioncan be taken.  Even if that policy was being increasingly brought on to humane lines,yet even in the years immediately preceding the war it still called in some respects forsevere  criticism.  In  the new democratic  Germany  it will  be  the task of SocialDemocracy to shape colonial policy more and  more in  such a way as to make it trulyserve the cause of civilisation.o
