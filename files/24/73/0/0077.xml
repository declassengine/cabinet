Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,$m$^             :---------------          Since I submitted a -Memorandum on this subject  on the 31st     December for the consideration of the War Cabinet,  developments of      the situation have taken place which I think it my duty to report.          As stated in that Memorandum the Unions  concerned are asking     for further concessions of a very extravagant character and they are     pressing for immediate consideration of their demands.   It has  been     determined that a sew Department, the Ministry of lays  and Communica.     tions, is to be set up and to this Department the control  of  the     Railways is to be transferred.  In these  circumstances  it  does  not     appear to me desirable that the programmes presented by tho Unions     should be dealt with until the new Ministry is constituted and  this     view was expressed by the Prime idnister  to Mr. J.B.  Thomas and the     tocutive of the National Union of Bailwaynien on  the  10th  January.     I myself, on the 15th January, saw Mr.  Bromley and a  Sub-Committee     of the Associatdd Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and     I explained the position to them in the same  way  as  the Prime     Minister had explained, it to Mr. Thomas and his colloagues. I have     since received from Mr,  Bromley a letter  as follows:-                                                  16th January,  1919.    &quot;Dear Sir Albert Stanley,     &quot;     Our sub-committee after our meeting with you.  yesterday     &quot;reported to my full i&amp;e   &apos; &apos;     &quot;consideration has  been     &quot;this morning who have especially after your ui^iuaa^&quot;should meet and go straight  on with the negotiations            my ikecutive  to meet some Authority which has power&quot;not only to make arrangements for but  to at  once  commence&quot;the negotiations which have so long been delayed.&quot;     My i&amp;ecutive are very anxious that  this question shall&quot;be pressed to an early issue,  failing which the wholo question&quot;will have to be submitted to our members so that  they may deoide&quot;what action the Society will take immediately.&quot;     I am sending this to you by hand in the hope that you &quot;may return a reply to m where my iixecutive are  sitting at  the&quot;Imperial Hotel, Russell Square, at the earliest possible moment.
           Executive urgently request that you let them have  .; your, reply to-morrow (Friday) as they will be leaving on Saturday   &quot;morning&apos; to lay the position before our members.                           Yours faithfully,                                J. BROMLEY.                                       GENSzfcL SiSCHBTARY.   and I wttach a copy of the reply which I have sent to him;-                                              17th January,  1919.   Dear Mr. Bromley,         I have received your letter of the 16th instant. At the  meeting which I had with yourself and the  members  of your Sub-   Committee on the 15th,  I stated that it was the intention of  the   Government to establish a Ministry of.Ways and Communications.   I  further explained that the Government proposed to  oroceed with.   its formation as early as possible end that the control of the  Railways would pass from the Board of Trade to the new Ministry.   I  also stated that, in view of this change, ij; was desirable   to postpone discussing the conditions of&apos;service and so on of the-   Railway employees until they can be dealt  with by  the new Ministry.   I  gather from your letter that your Executive Committee are anxious   to have the matters dealt with as speedily as possible.   This I am   assured is the intention, but it is first  of all necessary that the  Department which is to deal with the demands should  be established,  which cannot be done until parliament meets in February.          I hope      this explanation your Executive Committee will  realise the reason for the short delay and await the setting up   of the new Ministry, when their damarids will be dealt with.                                      Yours faithfully,                                             i.H. STANLEY.          Further, a  statement that, appears in the current number of   the Railway Review&quot;, the organ of the National Union of Railwaymen,   indicates that that Union also will press  for immediate considera-   tion of their demands.    As I stated in my previous  Memorandum,   representatives ;of the Railway Coa^nies can hardly  be expected to   lend their assistance in taking part in the negotiations  with the  Unions unless they are given a definite assurance  as to the  future   position of the Railway Companies and it is impossible-in my   opinion to conduct negotiations without the assistance of the  Railway Companies1 representatives.     (         Pfflim,,.                                              A. n. DiAiiLix.Board of Trade,        18th January, 1919.
