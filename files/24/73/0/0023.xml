&amp;          yColonel Jones.94OoiifIxlenlial.Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office, S.W.I.    GERMANY/028.MEMORANDUMonTHE  ALLEGED  SEPARATISTMOVEMENT  INRHENISH  PRUSSIA  AND  WESTPHALIA,     Reportsfaave been current regarding a Separation movementin Rhenish Prussia and Westphalia.    The movement has been described as prompted by three motives: (1) the desire on thepart of the great industrialists to escape the burden oftaxation which will result from the German War bill and theproposed enormous indemnities; (2)  the attitude of the Catholicshierarchy and clergy&quot; who resent the measures adopted in Berlinagainst the Church and the ecclesiastical control of schools;(3) the liberal and to some extent  the socialist and popularCatholic antipathy to the Berlin spirit and,preference inLiberal and Socialist and popular Catholic circles for a SouthGerman Connection with Hesse, Baden or Bavaria.     The attitude of the great industrialists appears to havebeen, in part at any rate, misrepresented.   Thus Herr AugustThySBen, the great iron king and his son Fritz, Herr HugoStinnes and his son and three or four others were arrestedearly in December on the charge of  having participated in aconference- at Dortmund where, it was alleged, they hadnegotiated with the Entente with a  view to an allied occupationof the districts near the Rhine.   It was presently announcedthat these industrial magnates had been  set at liberty and thata waiter, named Boersch, who was secretary of the localCommittee of Public Safety, had been arrested and had admitted that he fabricated the charges against them.   Thyssen and
.  -4 ^                 ,         - 2 -Stinnes have notf instituted proceedings against the membersof the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council of Miihlheim and againstthe Berlin President of Police for arbitrary and illegaldeprivation of liberty.     The attitude of the great Rhenish ana Westphulianindustrialists throughout the &quot;War&quot; may be briefly characterisedas follows.   In the critical days of 1914, they were doubtfulas to the wisdom of bringing the orisls to a warlike issue (seeDr. Muehlon&apos;s Diary).   Their press organ, the Sheiniache-Westfall ache Z^&amp;tung, wrote strongly in that sense.   Afterwar broke out they devoted themselves heart and soul to thesupply of war material, from which they reaped enormous profits,and became the most  insistent advocates of a fight to a victor-ious finish and of large colonial and also European annexations,particularly,the annexation of Belgium and of Briey and Longwy.Their sons  and other relatives were represented oh Ludendorff&apos;staff  and are known  to have been, with fatal results, his  chiefpolitical mentors.   After  the German collapse and the pro-visional success of  the Revolution the attitude of  the exeat industrialists has probably been best expressed by the right wing of the National Liberal  Party, which professes its&apos;willing- ness to accept the Republic as beine: at present the only possible form of Government,  but would like to seoure a position of influence  in the leadership of the newly  formed Democratic Party or Radical  and Liberal Coalition,   The Democratic Party does not, appear  to be willing to receive them  on these terms, as their  opinions are notoriously as  reactionary  in the  sphere of  octal policy  as those of  the Junkers, while the new  Democrats, although not professing Socialism, are advocates of  large Measures of nationalisation and  would  support  the  domestic Policy of  moderate Socialists like Ebert  and Scheidemann.   The MrttemberHesse and Baden  Democrats, formerly members&quot;of the of the Reichstag Radical  (Progressive) Party,  have  always  been
  of this colour,  and tho fjcr^UhiSl IsilW. ^ rm  exponent of then  views.   &quot;Members of the National Liberal Right on  the  other hand arc  assuredly adversaries &quot;of any scheme for mult Hating the Gentian Erupt &apos;  or for diminishing the  pre^dtcance of] Prussia,       2.   The attitude  of the Roman Catholic population of Rhenish  Prussia and Vfoetphalia  who  form the baokfbone of the Centre Party  (now re^iaptised &quot;Free Peoples Party&quot;)  is a more serious matter.       On December 4 tare  mass  meetings wore held at  Cologne when the  Reichstag Deputies Trimbom  and Marx wese the chief speakers and a  resolution was passed to the effect that &quot;in view  of the deep-  reaching political convulsions in German Empire&quot;&apos;and &quot;the complete  impossibility of creating an orderly Government in Berlin&quot;,  the  meetings demanded &quot;that the  recognised representatives of the popular  will of all parties on  the Rhine and in T/estphalia and the - other  lands on the Rhine should as soon as possible proclaim an independent  Rhenish-YJestphalian Republic part of tho Gorman  tapire.      - $he hierarchy and  the  influential parochial clergy hatoe been  alarmed by the measures which were announced by Adolf  Hoffmann,  one of  the twin Socialist Prussian Ministers of Public Yforship and  Education,, for the separation of Church and State  and  the abolition  of ecclesiastical inspection of the schools.   Cardinal von Harbmann,  Archbishop of Cologne at once sent --in a protest against these  pro ported measures and hap, since received assurances from the other  t&quot;dn Minister-, Haenisch,  that nothing rfill bo done re^ardin^ the  Constitutional rights and the vented interests of  the  Church, until  all parties have obtained a  full hearing,   Practically tho ouostion  of Church and otate has been reserved until the establishment of a  constitutional and parliamentary regime,.     On the oth$r hand, cleric  inspection of schools has been abolished by ministerial decree, asI  have all religious teaching  and religious exercises in the schools.
I97     Th&apos;-)-Cardinal-Arciil)aohop of Cologne is not popular in hisdiocese.  By birth and inclination lie&apos; belongs, unlike his pre-predecessor, Cardinal Fischer, to the reactionary wing of theGerman Catholics.  He has recently been at loggerheads with theRhenish Catholic Trade Unions, as he inhibited their president and also a priest who had been elected to the Reichstag forSt Gear against the official Centre candidate.  At the bottom of these differences was Cardinal von Hartmann!s hostility to the Prussian Franchise Bill, which was vigorouslysupported by Democratic Catholics of the industrial districts,The upshot was that the Cardinal had to give way in fact ifnot in form, and that the right of the Unions to urge their political Views was maintained.     In the question of the political independence, or rather the autonomy of Rhenish Prussia together with Westphalia,Catholic popular opinion may be more ready to fall in with the alleged views of the hierarchy on grounds which will be discuss-ed under the next heading.          3&apos;,   There has always survived in the Rhineland a  sstrong antipathy to Prussian methods of government and socialconceptions, although  the work of prussianization4 was verypersistently and to a  great extent successfully pursued andwas promoted by militarist, industrial, financial and academicinfluences.   Pan-Germanism, the Navy LeaguB  and the colonialmovement had no doubt  been very active, and the Cologne Gazette,once decribed by Bismarck  as  &quot;worth  an Army Corps on the Rhine&quot;,cultivated  a peculiarly aggressive type of Chauvinism.,  On theother hand  the Catholic Trade Unions formed the kernel of apolitically Liberal movement, whioh  alone was able  in the greatindustrial  centres to  defeat  Social  Democracy,   The NationalLiberals retained a small  part of the  parliamentary represent-ation,  but  there is reason to  believe  that their deputiesin the Reichstag and tbe Prussian Chamber were  considerably more reactionary than  the  mass of their constituents,.

     In the minds of the Catholic population-there have remained traditions of the easy-going, old-world life in the days of petty German States, ecclesiastical and secular.The Socialist Vorwaerts reports:               Now that the former easterns of authority have               collapsed and the great reorganisation of the               State is beginning, the thoughts of the Rhine-               landers revert to vanished epochs when &apos;life               was pleasant enough under the crozier&apos; and               spiritual or secular Princes from the Dutch               frontier up to Mainz and Treves wielded a               sway which was quite tolerable for the un-               asplring citizen.  Old memories in a romantic               setting revive and are associated with modern               wishes and anxieties.  Separatism in the Rhine-               land has quite recently progressed in a way               that could never have been suspected.Among all classes Catholic, Liberal and Socialist the fear efa Bolshevist dictatorship in Berlin and of a possible reactionwhich might follow it has turned the eyes of the populationtoward separatist solutions.  Among the more  Liberal elements,Catholic and secularist, the aspirations towards independence of Berlin, and safety have not taken the direction of separa-tion from Germany and alliance with her Adversaries, as theVorwaerts  would like to make out,  It is rather-a RhenishRepublic within the German Federation cr an w&apos;lf^W&amp;i% theRh.einland with Rhenish tiesse, Baden and the Bavarian Palatin-ate that is favoured.   The second of these alternatives is onthe lines cf Eisner&apos;s solution.  He would like to see the for-mer territorial division of States obliterated and larger Statesformed to the number  of eight or a dozen, capable in Central
and South Germany or providing a counterweight to Prussiain the North.&apos;     4,   There are some indications of a movement of opinion among the Prussians east of the Elbe, In favour of breaRlingup Prussia into a number of States, corresponding more or lesswith those out of which the-modern Prussian Monarchy was grad-ually formed.  These former champions of the old regime nowsee that the restoration of tho Prussian monarchy is hopeless,and they admit that, within the monarchy, the Prussian state must, ivi its territorial, political, social and economicalactivities, be a disturbing element in the future GermanFederated Republic.   Prussia, since 1871 has been latently oropenly at war with the spirit of the Empire owing to tbe differ-ence in their parliamentary basis and the character and out-look off their officials.   As for the Imperial chancellor and Secretaries of States,  &quot;the same men in leading , positionswere expected to conduct a democratic policy in the Empireand a conservative Prussian poiioy side by side.   The problem was insoluble&quot;.     The quotation is from an article whioh a leading Prussianofficial, Hep? von Batoeki, lately Prussian Pood Controller, nowChief Government President  of Kfihigsberg, has contributed to toe Deutsche Allgemeine ZGituna,   the organ of the GermanGovernment, or, perhaps, since the Revolution, of the government officials who nave survived the old r%lme.     Batocki goes onto point out that not merely have the monarchic political and                               inghlstfcpical reasons for maintain  the old Prussia in its oldterritorial extent with a central administration in Berlindisappeared since the revolution, but that there are new reasons   Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.

why Prussia should not bo perpetuated in its present form.Prussia comprehanded throe -  ., fifths of..the German.Empire.   Itis nsw going to have a parliament elected,  like that of the wholeGerman Republie,  by universal, direct and equal suffrage,    Its in-atitubions will now be completely assimilated to those of theGerman Republic.           &quot;The existence side by side of an Imperial and a        Pru sian Central  authority for the Interior, finr Justive        and for the other Departments, (Deutsche Allgemeine        Zeitung,  Deo.  10. Morning Edition),  would result in u        meaningless and superflous accumulation of instances&quot;.   Herr von Batooki further points out that  the division of Prussiainto a number of separate states would strengthen in the newGermany &amp;ne of the advantages winch the old  possessed in thevariety of its State life and State interests,           &quot;That Kflnigsberg and Kiel have in any regard closer        racial&apos;-intellectual or econcmio relations to Cologne,  to        Cassel, or to  Breslau than to Weimar, Dresden or Darm-        sta&amp;t,  cr to Sohwerin, Hamburg and Lttbeck, bo one will        assert.   But  if the greater non-Prussian centres are        going to continue to claim a gfeat measure of independent        life, the same claim may henceforth  be advanced fof those        German regions which were welded together in the uniform        Prussian State wolely by the sway of the Hohenzollern and        not by the nature of things&apos;,Herr von Batocki therefore considers legitimate the aspirationsthe Hhineland to acquire the seme degree c.f  independence as theother members of Federated German Republic,  Bavaria,. Baden,. Saxonyand the rest.   He thinks that the smaller states, - the ThuringianStates for example - Blight, well be combined  into- larger units,. sothat instead of .25 there might, &quot;be in future  from 10 to 15 Statescorresponding to the characteristics, social, economical and politic&apos;oal of the different regions of Germany..   The extent of this ama.l-rgamatien would determine the nature of.the partition of Prussia.. .If, as has been suggested, W^rttemberg., Baden and Hesse were tf^eunited into one State, it would net be necessary, to, divide Prussia&apos; :
 .  *                                                              102 fnt* nu*v* than three i,r four new States.    II $he uiiMle^Bised South German States were to remain as the*y are.a larger number  of new States could be car-red out of Prussia and her provinces could beIgrouped  for that purpose by twos or threes.    On behalf of the Government it is ^oin ted out that the question of a territorial and political reconstruction of the German States is a metier for the Gorman Constituent Assembly and that attempts, like the movement initiated in Cologne,  to anticipate itjjj decisions cannjt be too strongly  deprecated.     Attention i-.s further called                           0 bv the Frankfurter zeitung  to the dangers that may arise from the Elections fir Constituent Assemblies now  proceeding in various German States and the meeting of these Assemblies before the adec- tion and Convocation of the General German Constituent Assembly. The multiplication of parliamentary instances before the German Federated Republic has  been established might conceivably&apos; lead te consequences comparable to those which resulted from the simultaneous^ session  of parliaments  in Frankfurt and Berlin in 1848,   In this connection it is so far satisfactory that the elections  for tha Prussian National Assembly a e fixed for  January 26,  i,e.,  seven days later than those for the German Constituent Assembly.   It is probable that one of the first tasks of the  German Assembly will  be to define the limits of its own competence and that of the State Assemblies.    It remains to be seen whether it will be more suooess- ful in this  task than was the German Reichstag during the 47 years of the late  Empire.. 8   See Deutsche Allgemeine gejbtung  Deo.  12,  1918,  Morning Edition,       Artiole,  Die Reichsregierung und die Rbeinbllndelei. 0*    Frankfurter Zeitung.
