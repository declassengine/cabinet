Russia/018.V  \i/;   THE  SITUATION  -IN  THE  UKRAINE.     Since the armistice and the consequent withdrawal of the german troops from the Ukraine, the pelitical situation there has undergonea series of rapid changes.  It is still most unstable and it may bebut a matter of days before the Bolsheviks are masters of Kiev.   As in1917 national separatism is simply paving the way to Bolshevism.     On November 14 Skoropadski made a complete volte face.   Heopenly abandoned the programme tf Ukrainian independence, which,to satisfy the Germans, he had hitherto pretended to support, andcalled to power those Russian politicians who advocated a federalunion with Russia.   The Ukrainian separatists were dismissed anda Russian named Gerbel was appointed Prime Minister.  Russianofficers, of whom there were a large number in Kiev, formed volunteerdetachments and attempted to control the situation.    They calledupon Denikinrs army for reinforcements to meet the danger of aBolshevist  invasion.     Skorepadski&apos;s new regime, however, had no real force behind it and lasted  less than a ntjnth.   His downfall was not due to  his      iadvocacy  of federation with Russia, but to his association with theGermans and his failure to  introduce any wise prcgrarrme of land reform.fehile he  was appealing  to Denikin for help, a Ukrainian national council under  the separatists  Petlyura and Vinnichenko was formed  atByelaya Tserkov, South-West of  Kiev, which proclaimed  itself the directorate of the Ukrainian Republic.     Petlyura1 s followingnumbered  at first a few thousands, but was  soon  swollen by localBolsheviks  and discontented peasants who  obtained arms from theGerman  troops  as they withdrew.   On December 23  this  motley armyentered Kiev.   A programme of  complete  independence was  proclaimed,many Russian  officers  in  Kiev  were massacred, all Russian papers
 irGre  promptly suppressed and nearly all the pr inting-presses were requisitioned hy the new Government.   At the same time an announcement fas made  that until the agrarian question was finally settled the email peasant farms and communal holdings of land were to remain in the possession of their present owners.  All other land was to be distributed among those peasants who had none at all or who had not enough for their own needs.     The  new Government or Directory consists of five men, Petlyura, Yihhichenko, Schwarz, Andrievski and Makarenko, but, according to reports from Odessa, there are strong differences of opinion between Petlyura  and Vinnichenko on what is really the most vital question of all,  viz. attitude towards the Bolsheviks.   Though Petlyura has many Bolshevik fqJLlowers amongst his troops, he is nominally opposed to them, whereas.Vinnichenko favours an agreement.  Meanwhile the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine are becoming more and more active.   A message from Kiev dated Deoember 24 that appeared in the German press stated that strong Bolshevik movements were making themselves felt in Kiev and elsewhere, and that well-known Russian B?lsheyiks, who had been  forced to leave by the Germans, have again returned, among then being Eugenia Borsh, the Rosa Luxemburg of the Ukraine.   Soviets have  been permitted in Kiev, and it is said that Qb% are Bolshevik in spite *f  the fact that Petlyura&apos;s Government prevented certain workmen&apos;s unions from electing delegates.     While Bolshevik propaganda continues in Kiev, Bolshevik troops are advancing from the North East.   Having occupied&apos;Kharkov, where they  have reinstated the Soviets and levied an enormous tax on theBourgeoisie, they are now advancing westwards.   With a weak Government in Kiev,  that barely knows its own mind, It is difficult to believe that it will nc*w be long before the Bolsheviks are masters ?f the Ukraine. It is Interesting to notice In this connection that the Ukrainian
National Government, of Eastern Galicia under Holubovioh has resigned,as a protest against the decision adopted by the East GaljclanParliament to unite immediately with the Ukraine.   This may bedue to the very uncertain conditions prevailing in the Ukraine.     Petlyura:s position is an impossible &quot;me.  He is attemptingor threatening to wage war on three fronts.  Near Odessa he isfacing troops of the Russian volunteer army, backed by french troops and French men cf war.   According to the Bolshevik wirelesshe has sent a note to the Rumanian Government calling attentionto the concentration in various places of Rumanian troops whs have crossed the Ukrainian frontier, and he has  issued a warning thatthere may be a collision between the Ukrainian and Rumanian troops.At the same time he has sent an ultimatum to the Soviet Governmentdemanding the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from the territory of the Ukrainian Republic, ts which the Soviet Government, withits usual effrontery, has replied that there were no russian troops on Ukrainian territory and that the  troops opposing Petlyurawere native Ukrainians.  This, of course, is as much a half-truth in the case of the Ukraine as in the case tff Esthonia, Latvia  and lithuania where the Soviet Government always speaks of theinvading armies as the Esth&amp;nian, Lettish and Lithuanian RedArmies.     The general  situation shows that no hopes can be placedon the Separatist movement under Petlyura,  that any assistance givento this movement would end in failure as it did at the end of  1917.The real danger In the Ukraine is Bolshevism,  and Bolshevism  inthe Ukraine can only be fought by assisting the Russian VolunteerArmy which, in entering.the Ukraine, must make  it clear  that it takes its .stand on a democratic  xand programme, which, whileadmitting the principle cf private  property, will divide  the  bigestates among the peasants on an equitable  basis.   Such  a pro- &apos;gramme would be accepted by General Denikin&apos;s  Government  If itwere made a condition of real assistanod from  the Allies.
