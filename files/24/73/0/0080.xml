            Paragraph III of &apos;the Board of Trade memorandum(G.T.6635), and paragraph 6 of  the Postmaster General1smemorandum (G.T.6645) appear to be based upon a misconception.It was never intended that there should be any difference inthe standing of the permanent  and non-permanent members.   2.-      The proposed distinction in name is due  to  thefact that it will be necessary for the permanent  members to be in practically constant  session, meeting at leasto$ce a week, whereas the subjects to be discussed will  notbe likely to require the attendance of the non-permanent members more than, say, onee a month.   It will be observed,however, that the non-permanent members can attend everymeeting if they so desire.            It would, perhaps, be better if the permanent and non-permanent were respectively designated &quot;regular&quot;  and &quot;occasional&quot;*   3.-      The great point to be obtained by the proposedorganisation is thatHhe members appointed shal1  have first-hand knowledge of the subjects under considerate  n.   It  isin no sense a question of subordinating the trade or financial interests to those of the fighting services, but  of  arrangingthat the proposed Board shall constantly have available thebest technical knowledge of all aspects of the subjects underreview *   4.-      It is noted that the President of the Board ofTrade does not consider it to be of great consequence underwhat Department the new advisory body is to be;   while  thePostmaster-General is strongly opposed to its control by  theC . I oD *                &apos;   5.-      The original Admiralty proposal for the  new body to be under the.Board of Trade and the subsequent alternative proposal regarding the C.I.D.  were admittedly an  attempt  tofind neutral ground on which the interests of no  one executivedepartment would preponderate and upon which commercial interests would, at the same time, be adequately represented.            The admiralty attach the greatest importance  to  theproposed Board being under a neutral head, and are strongly supported in this policy by both the War ffiffice and Air Ministry.   6.-      As regards paragraphs 4 and 5 of th .  Postmaster-General&apos; s memorandum,  it may be anticipated that the C.I.D. willbe in a position to take a wider view of the needs of the whole empire than any one department of the Home Government could possibly do, and that in view of the experience of the  war  theC.I.D. will in future devote itself very largely  to thecommercial needs of the Empire.            The point raised in paragraph 7 appears to  favour theAdmiralty proposal, since Dominion representatives could more readily be asked to sit at a 3oo.rd assembled under the  aegis of the C.I.D. than at one under the head of a single departmentof the        - PROPOSED TELEGRAPH COMMUNICATIONS BOARD.            f&quot;&apos;J,UiO   :...................................-......          //        Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet
of the Homo Government.   7.-      The Admiralty desire again to  emphasise  the urgency of the appointment of the Board*   8c-      The case has now assumed the following aspectwith regard to wireless  telegraphy:-     (a)       The Convention of London on the subject  of            international W/T regulations  is seven years            old, and a new conference is two years overdue *     (b)       The regulations of the Convention of  London            have been rendered hopelessly out-of-date by            technical improvements made during the&apos;war, and  war            experience has shown that practically the whole  of            those regulations require drastic revision.     (c)      ( The whole question of high.-power point-to-point            W/T is entirely without international agreements            or regulations whatsoever.     (d)*      There is no constructive policy in W/T for  the            Empire, nor even for the United Kingdom, and. no            means of co-ordinating the requirements  of  the            self-governing dominions and colonies before  any            international body.   8c-      Due to the exertions of the officers of  the fightingservices, a temporary arrangement exists between the British,French, Americans and Italians, through the medium of an inter-Allied Signal and Wireless Commissions   There is everyhope that this arrangement can be continued, as the  Commissionincludes all the  countries (except Germany) seriously involvedin Vil/T, and its actions can practically regulate the V/Taffairs of the world,  at least until the next international conference (now two years overdue)..   9&quot;-      It is impossible for any regulations framed bythis overdue international conference to take effect until about two years from datoj  and  such conference,  if facedwith accomplished facts and a  smooth and efficient organisation,will most probably endorse the  arrangements made by theIntcr-Allied Commission referred to above.   10o-     It is therefore absolutley  essential that aBritish Empire policy should be  decided upon without delay,in order that  the British delegates to. the  above-mentionedCommission may be Instructed.   11*-     The necessity for  speed is  paramount.   Thetechnicalities  of wireless cannot be  overlooked or ignored,or relegated to a secondary position.   At  present theydominate the situation.   It  is  very  difficult, if not impossible, for mother  first-class  long-range W/T  stationto be established in this country without  interfering withan established French/  Italian or American line of Transatlanticcommunication.   12o-    These conditions  are capable  of modification inour  favour.    The ft/T officers of the  three services areactively.......
actively employed on the matter, but it is not strictly.their business,  and they are not in possession of all aspects of the case,  no.* of the desires of the colonies,and their efforts can only be regarded as an attemptto uphold the interests of the Empire until such time asproperly-constitutod Communications board, as proposedin the previous Admiralty Memorandum (G*T*6538J has beensot up and. can take over the work.(Signed) *      W,  H.
