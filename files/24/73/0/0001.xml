                 (This Docurn^t^rsHh^Kfoperty&apos;JPY..           B.ita......, R^,ty8 Covernig    gDLiP0c5:AlJ)jPJ fflOIUl PaO^OKIJanuary 4th  1919.Memorandum for the war Cabinet             by        air Brio Geddos.     I submit this matter for decision by the War Cabinet,and for th-G reasons which appear in the following state-ment I regard it as one which calls for very early settle-ment.     I am informed that.the national Factories for disposalcan be classified as followsj-     Glass km . (about 16 to 20).   factories which it may                prove necessary to retain permanently.     WagiSjB^  (about 85).&apos;  Factories which are suitable for                use as industrial concerns.,     Class     (about 25).  Factories which are not suitable               for industrial purposes but wliioh will probably               be retuired during the transition period as               magazines for breaking down ammunition.     Class D.  (about 115).  Factories which will revert to       &quot; &apos;      their original owners and to their pre-war uses.     In G.T. 5651 Dr, Addison laid down the position as it wasthen, and he urged that early consideration should be givenby the War Cabinet to the question of policy involved in thedisposal and use of National Factories with a view to settling the. principles upon&apos;: which departments should proceed.   he drew attention to the difficulty in deciding exactly wherethe line should be drawn between factories which oould fairly be called National Factories and those controlled and managed byf ,irm,s who have received financial or other assistance fromthe Government for the extension of their works or some other form of- assistance, such as the loan of plant or machinery.    &apos;Thi3,Memorandum (G.^ 5,551)  was considered by the EconomicDefence and Development Committee who made the following re-commendations to the War Cabinet;-.
&quot;* fj     Olaas^A^  ro remain in public ownership.     Class B*  The Ministry ox  hunitions with  the concurrence               of the Linistry  of heconstruction and  the  treasury               to dispose of such factories as are redundant               or as will clearly become redundant.     01as8 0.  To be left for use for  storage  purposes  and the               views of local Authorities to be obtained  with               regard to the ultimate  disposal of these               factor ies.     In the minute in which these recommendations were  formu-lated the following statement appears;-     &quot;It was understood that in Considering whether factories     &quot;are likely to be redundant or not regard should be had     &quot;not only to any possible requirements in respect of     &quot;munitions ^reduction ox for other war purposes but to     &quot;the possibility of the factory being required or being     &quot;suitable for work undertaken by the Government ox     &quot;local Authorities for various purposes&quot;.     [Phase recommendations were duly considered by the JarCabinet and approved by them (,&apos;ar Cabinet 48-3, minute 12).     In accordance with this approval the Ministry of Munitionslias passed to the Ministry of Reconstruction the names of 30factories in Class B.   The Liniatei of heconstruction hasex; expressed agreement to the sale of all these exoept two, namely the factories at Hackney karshes and at Birtley.     Hie sale is in the hands of air Howard Prank but he feelsz difficulty in going ahead as he understands that the primeLinlster has mentioned informally at a Cabinet meeting thatthe sale of national Factories was a ouestion*which would haveto come before the Cabinet as a whole.   13ir Howard &quot;jprank isparticularly anxious to make an immediate start for thef ol 1 ov i n /;; reasons;-   (1)  Applications for factories - notably Lirtley - are now          being received.  ( li)  IThe present is a good time to sell,. ( iii.) . H&apos;he sooner factories are disposed of the sooner will          they prove a moans of absorbing labour.     Action on the matter is thus at a standstill and an early decision is required on the following general principles;-
    1.  What number of National Factories are to be retained        Armament nucleus?      The ultimate answer to this question depends largely upon theTerms of Peace.   In the interval the Minister of Munitions is best able to express an opinion as to the number of faotorieowhioh should be reserved pending the conclusion of peace negotia-tions.   It is however clear that inability now to give this information places the armament producing firms in a position ofgreat difficulty, because they cannot deoide upon their futureline of business.   This stste of indecision cannot but have aprejudicial effect upon industry.   The position can be consider-ably ameliorated if such steps as can be taken are taken immediate-ly.   2.  Do the Government contemplate embarking on state       Industrial production in national Factories?     In G.T.6479  Sir Stephenson Kent points out how opposite arothe views of labour and of manufacturers.   The former desire thatthe State shall retain and operate national factories, and thelatter consider that so doing would check private enterprise andchoke the efforts of the manufacturing community.   Sir StephensonKent &quot;believes that factories can be utilised temporarily for undertaking arrears of railway stock repairs and so on, andin G.T.6047, that they may be utilised by Local Authorities fortraining and other purposes.      It should be noted that as an emergency measure the Ministryof Munitions ha?e placed orders for the manufacture of dairy plant and equipment at Woolwich and one or two orders of a similar naturewill apparently be given, but ho definite policy has yet been laiddown on this point.&apos;   3*   What method is to be followed in disposing of the balance        of.r edundant fact ories?
                      -4r    In G.T.5351 Dr. Addison expressed the wish that LocalAuthorities and other bo&amp;iee should have an opportunity of considering, before any sale is effected; whetnor redundantfactories can with advantage &quot;be used for public purposes, &quot;but sir Howard  rank is of opinion - and from a commercial point ofview it appears to me that he is right - that eaoh factory shouldbe advertised for sale as and when it comes up for disposal andthat simultaneously the public bodies should &quot;be given an opportunityof considering whether that particular factory oould with advantage be used for their purposes.    The different methods of disposing of redundant factories which I have considered are   (a)  The operation of the factories &quot;by the State as a           commerocial proposition.   (b)   ispo^al to the Local Authorities for the same           purpose.  * (o)  Sale or lease to Trade Unions.   (d)  Sale or lease to Co-operative Societies for the production            of the goods they sell.   (e)  Sale or loaco to private manufacturers.     As a result of my deliberations I submit the following recommendations which I  shall be glad if the War Cabinet wouldconfirm:-                                V   1.      That the Government  should not utilise national factories      for the purpose of embarking upon  a policy of State manufac-      turo and sale of Trade articles in competition with the Trading        Community
    2.     That the Government should not dispose of national       factories to Local Authorities to enable them to undertake       manufacture and sale upon a municipal basis.         Note;  All the.evidence I have examined in connection                with the above two recommendations leads me to                the conclusion &quot;that such a policy would be                injurious to industry and to the trade of the                country.    3,     That the Ministry of Munitions, in conjunction with the       Treasury, should be instructed to dispose at the earliest       possible moment consistent with a satisfactory price of       those national factories which are not required for armament       production in the interval between now and tho conclusion ef       peace, or for early use for manufacture of ospecial Government       stores of which the Government preponderatingly tho principal       use*;  which can advantageously be undertaken with Treasury       sanction in each caso-  4.      That where the intending purchaser is a Local Authorityit  should be a condition of sale that national factories should only be used for recognised municipal purposes such as those whichthey are already engaged.  5.      That the Ministry of Munitions should be authorised togive preferential treatment as regards terms of payment toCo-operative Societies and Trade Unions or to lease factories tosuch bodies, instead of selling them, and that, other things being equal, Looal Authorities wishing to purchase for Xc-cognised munici-pal activities should be given preference over private profitmaking concerns.
