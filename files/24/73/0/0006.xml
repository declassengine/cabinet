THE MINUTES of the 41st Meeting were approved.iSS HO-    2.   TEE CHAIRMAN, drawing attention to the Minutes of the 41st)E OF PAY  Meeting, Minuto 1, stated that the announcement which the) CONDI-   Comaitteo agreed to recommend to the War Cabinet for publication)NS OF S3R-had actually appeared in the press in a different form toX        that agreod upon by the Committee.   The Committee took note of          the fact that the public announcement had been altered to read as          follows             &quot;The Government, having learned that the fear is entertained             in some quarters that separation allowances may be discontinued,             wish it to be icnown that these allowances will be coatiauejl             as long as present conditions prevail, and until the whole             question of the futuro pay and allowances of the lighting            &apos;: foroes has been settled&quot;.                         &apos;&apos;iTUlTISS   3.   SIR CHARLES HARRIS, referring to Minute 5  of the 41stTEMPORARY Meeting-, pointed out that the general rules for assessing theHSGULAR   gratuities of Officers laid down therein applied to all Ctffioers,jJCERS IN  regular or temporary., and not only to temporary Offloera in the1 NAVY,    Uavy, as would apoeaf from &quot;the side note to the Minute.  m                      &quot;       &quot;&quot;&apos;&apos;   &apos;t FORCE.        TH2 COMMITTEE decided:-   ,that in assessing the gratuities for all Officers,temporary or regular, in the Uavy,:Array of Air For,oo,the -following, general, ratios; should apply:-
date.CONDITIONSpNDER WHICHGRATUITY ISFORFEITED.   fc) Tho period in respeot of which gratuity was paid       should be determined by tho statutory date for &quot;tho       ond of the war&quot;;  subject (00 in tho case of men)       to a maximum period of 5 years.4.   SIR CHARLES HARRIS called attention to Minute 4 of the41st Meeting, in which trero given certain conditions underwhich Officers were disqualified for gratuities.   He pointedout that in tho case of Officers who voluntarily relinquishedtheir commissions during the war gratuities were granted bythe War Office only if they had completed two years&apos;  service.He asked the Committee&apos;s authority to continue this practice,which was a variation of the rulo under which Officers voluntary-arily relinquishing their commissions forfeited all right toa gratuity.THE COMMITTEE decided:-     that the decision arrived at in Minute 4 of the 41st     Meeting should be amended to read as follows:   &quot;The     Committee agreed that all regular Officers who     served in the present war should receive  the  full     gratuity according to scale, save in the case  of suohj     Officers who have been cashiered, or request to     send in thoir papers, or have beon invalided out     through illness duo to their own misconduct,  or who     havo voluntarily resigned their commissions before     they have completed two years&apos;  service as commission-;     od Officers&quot;.11FATUITIES  F0R5.    THE CHAIRMAN,  with reference.to  the  Minutes  of  the 41s&quot;i.:EGULAR OFFI-Meeting,  Minute  3,  said that  this  question  had  been  raised RS  PROMOTED  again in a letter  he  had received  from Mr.Forster.   As theROM  TEE RANKS * matter had beox: left,  an Officer&apos;s  gratuity was  assessed only             on  the basis of  time  served as  an  Officer,  and  he obtained             nothing for his  service in the  ranks..   He  understood  that             there were great difficulties in the  way  of making a change             in  this procedure.                  SIR CHARLES HARRIS said  that  there wore serious administra             tive difficulties,  but  he could not  say that they were in-             super able.                  MR.F0RSTER  said  that he  had thought  over the matter since             the last Meeting,  and he considered that  they could  not hold             to  the viows decided  upon then.    He  had  ix.t a  largo number             of  business mon  recently,  and they were all perfectly  clear             that service in  the ranks should count towards  the gratuity.             He  proposed that an Officer who  had  served  in the ranks for             any period should  obtain the  soldiers&apos;  gratuity for  that             period as woll as  the gratuity  to  which he  was  entitled as             an  Officer.SIR CEARIES HARRIS said that there was also the(a) The rate of gratuity should be fixed according to    the rank held by tho Officer on tho 11th November,    1918.(b) Account should be taken of tho promotion of Officers    after tho 11th November,  1910, but no regard should    bo paid in tho assessment of gTatuity to reduction    of rank after that
case of the temporary Officer,  who would claim to  be  treated in the same way.   Further, there was the tempprary Officer,who had taken a regular commission.   He might put forward aolaim to be paid his gratuity under Article 497 of the  EoyalWarrant for the period during which he had boon a  temporaryOfficer as well as the gratuity to which he was entitledas a regular Officer.   It was in any event a most unfortunatfeature of the now proposal that the admittedly excessiveArticle 497 gratuities would be further added to.     DR. M/iOi\&apos;ALiAEA said that with reference to Sir CharlesHarris&apos; first point, ho agreed with Mr.Forster that it  wasimpossible to rule out service in the ranks in assessing agratuity.   With regard to the point respecting temporary officers who took permanent commissions, ho pointed cub thatthe gratuities to temporary officers were given to enablethem to    set up in business or resume their normal pro-fossion.   If a temporary Officer decided to change hisprofession and remain in the Army, the War office  were entitled to say that by doing this he forfeited his rightto the temporary Officers&apos; gratuity.     THE COMMITTEE generally agreed that this was  so.     JdFuBAREES asked whether service in the ranks  shouldbo taken into account in assessing gratuities - for  temporary officers.   The minimum gratuity a temporary officer would receive, was very large compared with the maximum that evena Warrant Officer would obtain, and he did not think itwas right to make tho gap oven bigger by adding a  gratuityfor his service in the ranks.     DR.MAOih-KARA pointed out that although the difference in tho gratuities&quot; of men and temporary Officers was somarked, the difference in tho responsibility was evenmoro marked.     THE COMMITTEE decided:-     (a)  that an Officer who had been promoted from the          ranks to a regular commission should receive  pay-          merit according to the scale laid down in 0..T.6286          for his period of service whilst in tho  ranks,          in addition to tho gratuity to which he  had          bocome entitled for his service as a commissioned          regular Officer.     (b)  An Officer who had been promoted from the ranks          to a temporary commission should receive payment          according to the scale laid down in G.T.6286  for          his period of service whilst in the ranks,  in          addition to tho gratuity to which he had become          entitled for his services as a temporary Officer          under Article 497&quot;of the Royal Warrant for Pay.     (c)  In the event of a temporary Officer receiving          a regular commission, such Officer would not  be          entitled to any gratuity under Article 497 of the          Royal Warrant for Pay, but should count  all his          commissioned service towards gratuity as a regular          Officer, in addition to any gratuity for service          in the ranks under (a).
i    \27jflTUITIES   6.    TEE  CHAIRMHi, with reference to Minute 5 of thofp TEMPORARY41st  Meeting, raised the  question of the gratuity toOFFICERS  111  be  paid to Officers of the Royal KavtfL Division,   HeTHE ROYAX   pointed out  that  these Officers, having served withHAVY.        the Army, had not served  afloat a sufficient time to            earn  any  Prize  Money, and  it  did not appear that the            gratuity  based  en the same scalo as temporary Officers            in  the Navy Who had oarncd Prize Money should apply            to  them.                 DBtMACMAMASA stated  that the Royal Naval Division            wore  a land  force, and had served continuously with tho            Army, and he certainly considorcd that thoir gratuity            should be assessed under Article 497 of tho Royal Pay            Warrant.   Ho would like  first, however * to refer the            question  to  the Board of     Admiralty.                 SIR  CHARLES  HARRIS said  that tho difficulty arose            between Officers  of the Royal ,Javal Division and other            Officers  under  tho Admiralty.   Ho thought that tho War            Offico would not  object to the officers of tho Royal            naval Division  being treated  in the same way as            Officers  of  the Army, so  long as the Admiralty definitely            undertook that  tho matter  should remain there                 THE  COMMITTEE docidod:-                     that, subject to the concurrence of the Board                     of     Admiralty, the gratuity based on a 100                     days&apos; pay for the first year!s service and 50  days&apos;                     for subsequent  years of service to be paid to  temper                     temporary Officers  of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines                     should  not apply to temporary Officers of the  Royal                     Haval Division,  vh o should receive payment on  the                     scale laid down in  Article 497 of the Royal Warrant                     for Pay.sU?PLEMBi?TARY7.    TEE  CHAIRM stated  that tho question had arisen^ARATIOII   as  to whether,  for  the purpose of the  supplementary!&apos;J;0WANCE  TO separation  allowance of 6/6d  payable to childless wives,HLDLESS   \  an  unmarried wife should  be considered as a wife orUVES.        as  a dependent.   It was  a question of definition which            tho Committee was called  upon to  decide.                 SIR  A.G.BOSCABSU  said that  an unmarried wife was            treated in  exactly.the same way  as a married wife in            the case  of tho ordinary  separation  allowance.   Tech-            nieally,  however, she  was a  dependent, and under tho            rules of  the Special Grants Committee Reg. 7  (l)cl.,            dependents  could  obtain.the supplementary allowance  of            a Bvm not exceeding 6/6d  only at  tho discretion of           , Local T)ommitfees&apos;.&quot;&apos;&apos; Enquiries wore &quot;being reoeivecTfrom            local.Committees*all over the country  as to whether  an            unmarried wife  should  be  considered as a wife  or as  a            dependent.    Ho  would  like to know how tho Committee            wished  to define  tho position of unmarried wives.                 THE  CHAIRMAN said, that since  they were treated  as            wives for the  purpose  of  separation allowance  and also            maternity benefit,  he  thought they  should be treated            as  wives  for the  purpose  of the  supplementary  allowance.                 SIR  CRARLBS  HARRIS pointed  out  that  the claim  of  the un-            married wife had  originally rested mainly  on  the  existence of            children.
PAY OF TBSNAVY, ARMYMID AIRFORCE.     SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that thoy wanted to knowfirst of all how big an Army would be required.   Ifsufficiont men for India and the Colonies were not forth-ooming on the terms offered, other terms would have tobe arranged;  but tho rates of pay of regular soldierswho wero bound to corve would in any case have to beoonsiaored.     DR.MACUAJLARA said that he hoped that the considera-tion of conclusions come to by the Board of admiralty would not be held up until tho arrival of recommendationsfrom 1ho War Office and the Air Ministry.     THE COMMITTEE adjourned further discussion on     the Memorandum pending the roceipt of a further Momo-     randum from the Board of Admiralty and tho Report     of &quot;file Admiralty Committee which was consider -     ing this question..     THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE ADMIRALTY, the Financial     Secretary to the War Office, and the Under Secretary     of State &apos;to tho Air Ministry, undertook to keep each     other constantly informed as to any proposals regarding     the pay of tho navy, i;.rmy or Air Force  respectively     which might be put forward by tho Committees appointed     ad hoc in the threo Departments.PROPOSED    9.   MR.FORSTER, with  reference to Papor Ho. 116, vh ichrHGREASE IN contained proposals for the  increase in the scale  of  !  SCALE OF ordinary pensions  for  Haval  Officers1 widows, said thatpiiTIIJARY    he would like this question  deferred until it had  been  3IONS    considered by tho  War  Office.  &apos; A&apos; Memorandum was being ; naval    prepared on tho  comparative  increases, in the case of widowsJUICERS&apos;   of military officers..   It v/6uld be ready in a few  days.IIDOWS.                THE COMMITTEE adjourned discussion of this subject           until  the next Meeting.  ..     MR.FORSTER stated that he would like to have some-time to think she matter over, as ho had only receiveda copy of the Agenda late last night, and had toon unableto consult with anyone on tho subject.     THE COMMITTEE adjourned further discussion on this     question until the next meeting.8.   MR.FORSTER, with reference to the Admiralty Memo-randum on tho subject of revised rates of pay to thoNavy? (G.T-.6584), said that ho understood that the Ad-miralty,  the War Office and tho Air Ministry were goingto consider the rates of pay in the respective services.In reply to tho Chairman, who asked if the y/ar office had begun to considor tho question, Mr.Forstor said thatthoy hc&apos;.d promised bounties and continuation of separation allowances to men vfao iv ould remain in the Service&apos;forcertain periods.     THE  CHAIR MAI! road certain passages from the admiralty memorandum to tie effect that a revision of naval ratesof pay was of vital importance   lie presumed that the-army Council hold the same violas regards the Arm?rates of pay.
PAY- 10.  TH2 CHAIRMAN raised tho question of whether payment DijJ- to men who wore demobilised could bo paid in a lumpON.  sum invtoad of in three instalments.          SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that at present a man     obtained :S2 at his dispersal station!  after that he     obtained pay and ration allowance (about 25/&apos;- a wook)     for four weeks;  while hiB v/ifo obtained separation     allowance for six weeks.   At tho end of the four weeks     he obtained his gratuity in tho form of Post Office     Deposit, and tho balanco of his account.   He thought     a great deal of trouble would be caused if men were without     money whilst still in the Army, as they were    during this.     period.          MAJOR RAIRD said that in th o case of the Royal     Air Force it would bo difficult to get tho accounts     settled up quickly, as a groat many men had transferred     to them from other arms of the service.   Had the War      ,     Office  jay objection to their men being given a lump     sum in paymont on account, tho final account to be     settled later?          MR.FORSTER thought that this might cause trouble,     and that it would be better to have a uniform system     of payment.          THE COMMITTEE agreed          that it was preferable that, if possible, the system          of pay now in force should be adhered to, and that          all payments made to men on demobilisation by tho three          services should bo made on a uniform system.S TO 11.   DR.E\Ci!lAMARA said that tho Committee had decided     and the War Cabinet had agreed that the monthly in-     croments to the gratuities  of Warrant Officers,     Potty Officers, rj.0.0*3 and men of the Navy, &amp;rmy and     the Air Forco,who received  service pension and pay     concurrently  should be on the  basis of half tho in-     crements received by those  who were not  in receipt     of servico pension and pay.   He thought that this     attitude could not be nvaifcfcainod, since  the principle     was generally accepted that a manrs pension was earned.     Tho Ministry  of Pensions  took  the view  that a man in     receipt of a  pension should not suffer  in the matter of     his wages from a particular employer on  account of  that     pension.          THE COMMITTEE requested Dr.Macnamara to bring  the          question forward  at  the next Meeting.THE SECRETARY was instructed to call a further meeting of the- Committee on Wednesday, the 8th inst.
