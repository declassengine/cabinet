SECRET,                   MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.jr^^pfieport  for  Week  ending Wednesday, January 8,  1919.PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.  Inter-Allied Food Control.1 mmhhhmi          The  Associated Governments  have decided to establish  a  Supreme  Council,      consisting of  two representatives of France, Italy, the  United States, and Great      Britain,  to deal  with the questions of food,  finance,  and  shipping  resources in      relation to the revictualling  and supply of Liberated and Enemy Territory, and to      co-ordinate such supplies with supplies for Allied and Neutral countries.          At the request  of the War Cabinet, Lord Reading  and Sir John Beale will, for      the time being, represent His Majesty&apos;s Government on this Council.          Certain emergency measures have  already been taken to provide  relief where      needs are acute.  In this way assistance is being rendered to Serbia and Rumania.          The Inter-Allied Commission (upon which Sir William Beveridge is the British      Representative) inquiring into the food needs of German-Austria, has met represen-      tatives  of Vienna and of  the German-Austrian territories at Berne.   In view of the      serious  food situation in  these territories, interim arrangements are being made for      the supply of  a certain quantity of foodstuffs, and some  supplies have already  been      sent to Vienna.          The  Food Gouncil. Mr. Clynes  presided over meetings  of the Council  on      Thursday, January 2nd, and Tuesday, January 7th.          The Council have decided that no  fresh ration books  shall be issued  for the      period May to November.  As regards meat  and  sugar  it was agreed that after the      present books  expire at  the beginning of  May retailers  should be rationed, and      the customers tied to particular retailers ; if  necessary the spare leaf in the  present      book could be used.  It was  agreed that butter and margarine should  be taken off      the coupon as soon as possible but that retailers would continue to be rationed and      the customer entitled to a  certain maintenance.  The ration is to  be  increased from      January 12th from  five  ounces to six ounces, in the proportion of five ounces of      margarine and one ounce of butter.   A similar increase will also be made in the      kosher margarine ration.          Sir A. Anderson reported that the United States Government proposed to  free all      exportable food  products  dealt with  by the Meat  and Fats Executive,  with the      exception  of dairy produce.   The  view of  the  Council  was that, as regards  hog      products, private importation from  the United States should be permitted as soon      as importers were willing to take over  the stocks  of the Ministry of Food  at  cost      price.          The Council assented to the export of  surplus  stocks of pickled horseflesh to      Belgium.          A proposal for lowering the retail price  of condensed milk  by lfi. per tin  was      approved.  It was agreed that the  Imports  Board should be authorised to import      32,000 cases of condensed  milk from  New Zealand during the present cereal year.          The Council approved a  proposal put forward by Lord Bledisloe (a) for making      at the  earliest possible date an allowance  of sugar to  philanthropic  buffets,  &amp;c,      established for the benefit  of members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, and (b) for increasing      the allowance to all  catering establishments, and at the same  date removing the      prohibition on the use of  sugar for  sweetening beverages.  A memorandum by Lord      Bledisloe on the resumption of the export trade in confectionery was also considered.      It was agreed that a yearly export of  confectionery, &amp;c, up to about 25 per cent, of      the 1913 exports should be allowed.A ,       The Food Controller has  decided that an announcement should be made  at once      that it is not intended to alter the existing prices of  milk  up to the end of April.  It      was agreed that a decision on  the  question of summer prices could not be given at      present, but  that the Board  of  Agriculture  should be consulted before a decision      was arrived at.                                         ;&apos;         A (33)7191-1  Pk9  145 1/19 B k S                                           A
     The question of fixing the price of salt was discussed.  It was reported thatmanufacturers were making profits in excess of the scale  suggested  by the CostingsDepartment,  but only 7 per cent, of the total output was  for domestic use.  It wasagreed that it was not worth while talcing action to control prices at the present  stage in view of the fact that ordinary commercial conditions would probably tend to  lower prices.     The Food Controller has decided that a further  memorandum should be sent tothe Cabinet pressing for a decision on the suggested increase in the  output of  beer,and submitting the scales of  prices.  It was agreed that the  Prices Order need notapply to Ireland.     A letter from the Ministry  of Munitions was considered, recommending thatRegulation 30d of the Defence of the Realm Regulations  should be suspended, thuspermitting the use of grain by distilleries for the  production  of  spirit.  The Councilagreed that Regulation 30n should be suspended and that the resumption of distillingshould be. permitted generally.     The Imports Board.-The question of the importation of bacon  and hams fromthe United States and Canada has been further considered by the Board.     It was reported that for the two weeks ending December  28th  shipments hadaveraged 16,000 tons per week.  In view of  the extreme difficulty of  handling  morethan  12,000 tons per week here,  the Board  agreed that  the Ministry  of shipping should  be  requested to  cable to their shipping  agents at New York,  stating thatshipments must on no account exceed 12,000 tons  from the United  States and canadian  any one week, and that the excess shipments of  8,000 tons during the period endingDecember 28th must be adjusted by  reduced shipments spread  over  the  next  three or four weeks.   A cable in similar terms  has. been sent to the Allied Provisions ExportCommission.     A  letter from  the  Danish  Bacon  Company  was considered, suggesting thatarrangements should be made for the. supply of maize from, the Argentine to Denmark,in order that the  export trade in Danish bacon may be restarted.  The Board agreedthat they had no,objection to the supply of maize  from the Argentine to Denmark.    . The following contracts have been arranged for forward purchases :        (a). Butler. This season&apos;s  exportable  surplus   from  South  Africa and the             Argentine till March 1919.  In addition, Treasury  sanction has been            &apos; asked for the purchase of the exportable surplus from the Argentine for        &apos;..  ;  the. period from April 1919 till June .1920.  The exportable  surplus  of            /butter for  the  seasons  1919 to August 1920 from Australia and New          .,  Zealand has also been contracted for.: -     (k) Cheese. Contracts have been arranged for the purchase of  the  exportable             surplus of cheese  from Australia and New Zealand till  May 1920, and             from Canada till December 1919.      (c) Tea.--(!)() per cent, of  the Indian crop and 50 per cent, of the Ceylon crop           .  are  being  purchased,  the total amount being  156,000 tons,   value             approximately 14,500,00OL  The contract finishes on  May  1st,   1919.             It is probable that shipment will be  completed by the  end of  March, the           .  amount still remaining to be shipped being 42.000 tons,      (a) Cotton Seed. Contracts have  been  arranged for the  Egyptian  exportable r;  ,..    \ surplus of August 1919, quantity 25,000 tons, value 2,250,000?,   ,  The Consumers  Council. The Council met on January 8th.  After consideringvarious questions connected with the National Kitchens Movement and the de-rationing of jam and margarine the Council passed to the Report of the Legalisation of Improve-ments Sub-Committee.  Referring to the  question  of the State retaining the sole  rightto import essential foodstuffs the report says :            The  Sub-Committee do not profess to  have examined this subject  in all      its bearings.  Upon certain aspects of the subject they have, however, come to      definite conclusions.  First, a monopoly of State purchase of imported foodstuffs      1 would, in their opinion, be a powerful weapon not only against  a  foreign trust      but also against a shipping ring.   Second,  in times  of fluctuating  prices,  State      purchase would secure the importation, of articles when a private  trader would      be loth to undertake the risks involved.   Third, when the article  is scarce or      there. is. even a small excess of demand over supply or  there is hot, for any      reason, effective competition between  dealers,  prices are  apt to  rise to  an
      inordinately high level a level out  of  all proportion to the amount of the      deficiency.  Our experience is that where there is  any shortage,  control of      prices without control  of distribution  is of little, if  of  any, use, and that the      best way to achieve effective distribution  is for the State to  have the right to      exercise control  by reason  of  its  ownership  of  the articles controlled.  Upon      this head the Sub-Committee have passed the following resolution :              That the Government  should continue to purchase and import essential        foodstuffs from  overseas and should  take all necessary steps through the        control of imported foodstuffs to maintain supplies and control prices.    With reference to  the question of the removal of internal control the  Sub-Com-mittee passed the following resolutions :     (a)  That coupon restrictions and other restrictions limiting consumption should          not be retained after it becomes reasonably  certain, having regard to the          state of supplies, that such restrictions can be abolished  without fear of          having to re-impose them.    (b)  That registration of customers should continue  for the present under arrange-          ments whereby, at short intervals, the public  have the  unrestricted right          to change  their  registration  either generally  or  as to any  particular        .  rationed article.    (c)  That registration  of  customers  should not be abandoned until supplies are          fully sufficient.    (d)  It is desirable  that the retail prices of all essential foodstuffs  should  be  fixed          so long as there is any risk of scarcity and while present  conditions exist,          and that prices should also be fixed  for such foodstuffs as  are from time to          time being  imported by the State.    The Report was adopted by the Council.                           SUPPLIES AND DISTRIBUTION.    Dried Fruits. The  s.s. &quot; Chiverstone &quot; has sailed from Greece with 1,500 tonsof currants on board.   The Ministry of Shipping are arranging to lift a further 15,000tons.   The first steamer  carrying 5,498 tons of dates has sailed, and boats are beingloaded with further quantities.    Two hundred and fifty tons of dried fruit of  various-descriptions have arrived from  Australia.  The whole of the Ministry&apos;s purchase of Californian fruits, amountingto 20,000 tons, has been despatched  from the contractors, and should be available for distribution at the end of February.    Meat. With a steady diminution in the supply of live stock,  which is likely tobecome even more marked in the course of the next month or two, a greater measureof dependence has to be placed upon the supplies of imported meat, and the principalquestion  occupying  attention at  the moment  is the fair distribution of the limitedsupplies of home-killed meat.   With this in view, the trade in many areas is  beingfurnished with nothing but home-killed meat for a given period, this being followedby another given period  in which only imported meat is supplied.  In this, way theretailers  are precluded  from  showing any  preference  to  their customers, and thepossibility of one retailer having home-killed  meat and  his neighbour nothing  hutimported meat is avoided.  In view  of the fact that the public are shortly to have anopportunity of  transferring their registrations, if they desire to do  so, it  becomes amatter  of importance that no retailer should occupy, a preferential, position in respectof his supplies.   The only drawback to the adoption of these methods throughout thecountry lies in  the fact that the shortage of labour in  the stores and on the railwaysmight  make it impossible  to  deal with  the quantities of meat required under thissystem. ,,:     Some few complaints  are being received  regarding   the  quality of  the meatimported from North America.  While it is not suggested that these complaints areunfounded,  it can be  stated with assurance that the  quality of the meat is superior to that  which gave rise to such serious trouble last summer.  There is no doubt that-certain sections are becoming increasingly impatient of control and  regard  control as unnecessary since the signing of  the Armistice.  Efforts  have already been made  todispel  this very shortsighted view.               -                     . - ^
     The losses incurred on the grading of: cattle  still give rise to occasional  trouble.This has  been particularly marked at Derby where the butchers closed their shops and refused  to take their allocation.  Investigation showed that there was very littleground for complaint on the basis of the aggregate result, and the trouble  has nowbeen settled.  In other towns, in places such as North Wales  and Cornwall,  butchershave absolutely declined to handle frozen meat, but here also it is confidently  expectedthat the trouble will disappear when it is realised that there is no possibility of gettingsupplies of any other description.     A  temporary strike  at Birkenhead  stopped supplies of Irish cattle through that quarter, but a satisfactory settlement  has now been reached, and trade  has  been resumed  through its normal channels.     Potatoes. The position with regard to potatoes varies very much in the  different areas.   In Scotland it is reported that a serious  difficulty is being  experienced atpresent in the disposal of surplus supplies, and  that unless a more ready sale isfound  by transmission to England, there will be  a considerable reduction in acreagenext season.   It is  estimated  that the surplus amounts to 20,000 tons, after  allowing350,000 tons to meet seed requirements.   Disease in the crop is general, throughout thecountry, and is causing anxiety in some  areas, more particularly in the North-eastern and South Midland Divisions, and in Lincolnshire.   In the Northern Division, on theother hand, the crop is said to  be  keeping well on the whole.  In the South-WesternDivision the  crop is reported to be abundant, but not keeping well.     Some idea of the difficulties caused by the prevalence of  disease may be formed from the following  report from the North-Eastern Division :            &quot; In the week commencing 13th December 47 waggons, of 5 tons each,      &quot;were refused from the North Riding, and in tho  same period 17 waggons were      refused from the East Riding, on account of disease and canker; this makes a      total of 320 tons of  indented potatoes refused within one week  from two      surplus  zones.&quot;     Tea. A public sale of  Government tea, for  export  only, was held yesterday.11,301 packages were catalogued, out of which number 10,000  were  sold in  the saleroom at prices very much in  advance of the minimum limits fixed by the Ministry.The residue was taken out of the sale at prices slightly below the limits fixed, and itis expected that this will be sold  shortly at the prices fixed.  A further sale will beheld on January 20th, when a similar amount of tea will be put up for  auction.               Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.     The Milk (Local Distribution) Order, 1918, dated&quot; 19th December 1918, authorisesFood Committees to control the local distribution  and consumption of milk, and  togrant priority to consumers.  The Order came into force on 1st January.                             Enforcement of Orders.     The total number of prosecutions recorded in the fortnight ending December 28th1918, is 922, of which 845 resulted in convictions.     Sentence of  imprisonment  without  option was inflicted  in  two cases,  both  ofwhich were under the Rationing Order.   At Ley ton a woman was sentenced  to threemonths&apos; imprisonment for having made a false statement when filling -up  an Appli-cation Form for a Ration Book.  At South Birkenhead a woman was sentenced to one month&apos;s imprisonment for securing, and making use of, nine Ration Books, her familyconsisting of only four persons.     A local meat shortage  was  caused  at Bromley by the negligence of a  butcher,who omitted to send in the  required fortnightly  returns  for three  fortnights  in succession, and also to forward coupons on the specified dates.  The result was thatmeat required, amounting to  2,341 lbs., was unable to be taken  into  account in thereturn made by the Food Committee to the Ministry,  and the  local  supply was thuscurtailed.   Defendant was fined 10L and 21. 2s. costs.

Meat. The  English markets for live stock were  closed for the greater part ofthe week ended 28th  December  and the supplies  of live stock in Great Britainrepresented  only 3,500 tons, which were  supplemented by 400  tons of home-grownmeat from, cold stores.   In addition, 3,600 tons of imported  refrigerated meat were released, making a total supply of 7,500 tons.   This  small supply has to be taken inconjunction with the high figures for the preceding two weeks.  The average weeklysupply for the four weeks ended 28th December is thus, estimated at 21,600 tons forGreat Britain, of which 18,700 tons were available against the ration.   With a doubleration for Christmas week the average ration allowance was 19,000- tons for the four weeks.  It therefore appears that the public did not take up the whole of  the  largerration to which they were entitled.    Fish. The  supplies of fish during the week ended 28th December were  small.The quantity received at Billingsgate and other large inland markets, which had been steadily maintained  at 3,600 tons per  week in the first three weeks of December, fell to 1,600 tons in the fourth week.   The net supplies at Billingsgate were 33 per cent.less than those for the corresponding week last year.   The shortage appears to be dueto an extended Christmas holiday in the fishing industry.    Table  B  (1).-The  quantities of  foodstuffs  passing  into  consumption in theUnited  Kingdom in the four weeks ended December 28th show a general  reduction.This is due to the  extremely low quantities issued  in Christmas week.   The extraration   of  sugar is  reflected  partly in  the higher  issues  for the  periods  ended14th and 21st December, the remainder of the requirements  having  been met fromaccumulated stocks in the hands of retailers.    Provisions. The returns from multiple shops  and co-operative societies for - thefour weeks ended 21st December show a rise in the retail sales of eggs (26 per cent.),    A  7191-1                                                               B             PART  II.-SUMMARY  OF THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    Imports.    Imports for the week ended 4th January (251,800  tons) were well above theaverage.   This was partly due to the inclusion of some of the imports which actuallyarrived in the Christinas week and partly to exceptionally large imports of wheat andHour (186,600 tons as  equivalent grain) which were greater than those recorded inany week since  July 1917. Sugar imports (1.9,200  tons)  improved  but were not sufficient  to meet the ration  requirements.   There  were  good imports  of  bacon(21,300 tons), and  meat (13,400 tons), and again large imports  of cocoa (3,800 tons).Imports of cereals, other than wheat, were low and no rice arrived.  There were againgood imports of oranges (11,200 tons) and apples (3,700 tons), and a greatly improvedimport of bananas (1,900 tons).    The  total imports for the first 18 weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19are compared in the following table : 
lard (21  per cent.),  bacon (10 per cent.),  and butter  (8  per cent.), arid a fall in the sales of cheese (17 per cent.), compared with the preceding four weeks.  The increasein the sale of eggs is no  doubt due mainly to the fixing of  a maximum price.  the decrease in the sale of cheese has been accompanied by an increase in the stocks fromsix days&apos; to eight days&apos; supply, and is probably due to the holding back of sales inview of the reduced release of Government cheese announced for January.    The percentage changes compared with the preceding four weeks, and with thecorresponding weeks a year ago are as follows : -	Sales in Four Weeks ended 21st Dec.

Stocks.    The changes in stocks during the Christmas week have been unimportant exceptthat the stocks of cheese have declined  by 2,000 tons and now stand  at 22,400 tons or about nine weeks&apos; supply.  Stocks of meat declined 1,000 tons, but stocks of canned meat rose 900 tons; poultry and game  declined 270 tons...........    A substantial proportion of the bacon imports from America is being stored bythe Ministry the figures are as follows : --	Total quantity stored.
