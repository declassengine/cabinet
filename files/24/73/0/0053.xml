By War Cabinet Minute of 4 September 1918 (469A) it was directed that the decision as to resuming work on the &quot;An3cn,&quot;Howe&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; should be deferred until the end of 1918.   Thequestion is therefore now raised for the decision of the War Cabinet.         It will be remembered that these are three battle cruisersbuilding; in private yards, and that work upon them has been sus-pended since the 9th March 1917, chiefly owing to the shortage ofman-power and the needs of merchant shipbuilding&apos;.         Whilst labour was scarce and Government work absorbed allthat was available, the Contractors raised no objection to thisstoppage of work.   Now, however, they point out that the vessels are occupying- most important berths, whioh would be of the gratest value for building; large merchant ships and if the berths are toremain out of action, compensation will be due.   A decision as tothese ships is therefore desirable as soon as possible.         At present prices, the three ships when completed will havecost between five and six million pounds each, of whioh less thanone million pounds each has as yet been expended.         The following are the chief naval considerations involved:-              (a)  As pointed out last September when the                   Admiralty urged that the ships should be                   proceeded with,, the Fleet is relatively                   weak in battle cruisers owing to losses                   of this type of ship during the war.              (b)  If under the Peace Terras the German                   Battle cruisers should be either returned                   to Germany or disposed of in any way                   prejudicial to our naval interests, the                   need for the additional battle cruisers                   would become acute.              (c)  The United States naval programme provides                   for the building of six battle cruisers.                   If this progr&amp;vTme be proceeded with our                   shortage in vessels of this class must &quot;be                   remedied.              (d)  It is to be hoped that we are entering upon                   a situation in which we shall have no                   definite prospective enemy against whom to                   dispose ouh ships in peace time.  This is                   exactly the situation which enhances the                   value of the battle cruiser, a type of                   vessel whioh has the capacity to accept or                 -  refuse action with battle ships.              (e)  Apart from the &quot;Hood&quot;, these are the only                   large ships building which embody the results                   of war experience.   If they are not proceeded                   with, there will be a gap of several years in                   construction of capital ships, which will un-                   doubtedly hamper the regular progress of design.
There appear to be three possible courses    1,   To proceed with the ships, whioh could he completed in about 2V2 - 3 years.   It must be recognised that to do so, if at the same time we destroy the G-eman battle cruisers, wouldoccasion criticism, although the Admiralty consider that thepolicy could be justified.    2.   To cancel their construction, taking down and removing the material already built in.   If this course be adopted, largeliners will no doubt be laid down upon the slips, and as the numberof berths in the country in whioh battle cruisers can be built isvery limited, there would be considerable difficulty in subsequentlylaying down now ships of this class at short notice if the develop-iaent of the Internationa] situation should necessitate it.   Thiswas the case when it was originally decided to lay these ships down.    5;   To defer a decision until after the Peace Conference.In this case heavy compensation for Keeping the slips idle will nodoubt be demanded by, and duo to the Contractors,The matter is submitted for the decision of the War Cabinet.(Sgd.)
