     ADMIRALTY ^MORaljDUM FOR tLJl G^BIXS.              The Admiralty cull attention to the memorandum submitted by them to the War Cabinet on the  D.Bb November.  1918, asking for legislation authorising the retention of men in the Navy beyond the end of the war and their recall if necessary on remobllisation.fl             The War Cabinet in their minute 503 of 18th November sanctioned the preparation of a bill  on these lines but. time did not admit of the bill being passec\ through Parliament during the last session.              In the meantime demobilisation is proceeding, and large numbers of men will be discharged whose  period of engagement in the Royal Navy or the various  Reserves have  expired, Suoh men cannot, as in the oase of men released from Service in the Army, be automatically&apos; transferred to a Reserve under the Military Service Act; and the position therefore is that until the Bill referred to is passed the Admiralty have  no statutory power;? to compel them to rejoin the Naval Service *              The Board accordingly consider it desirable to call attention to this matter, as should any grave  emergency calling for the remobilisation of the Fleet arise  in the interval before the projected Bill is passed, it would be  necessary for immediate authority to be given to the Admiralty to  proceed with the recall of the men demobilised - in anticipation of legislation.              $very man released is given a Protection and Identity Certificate which contains clear instructions  as to what he is to do in the event of mobilisation being Ordered and the actual process of summoning the released men to return therefore, present.. no diffioulty.                         (Intlld) R. R. W5MYSS.
