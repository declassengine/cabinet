THE LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending 22nd January, 1919.                                    SUMMARY.Part I: General Remarks.    The Miners&apos; Demands at the Southport Conference are discussed.Part II: Press Comments.    (1) The Labour and Socialist Press. The opinion of the Labour Press on the PeaceConference; on Foreign Affairs,  with  special reference to the German Revolution;  on home  Affairs, with special reference  to the New Ministry and the  47-hour  week; is described.    (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation and Resettlement. The views of the Daily Presson the Discharge of Munition Workers; and on the Demobilisation of the Army, withspecial reference to the new scheme ; are described.Part III:  District Reports.    The 47-hour agreement is still the chief cause of disaffection.Part IV: Disputes.    (a) Involving a Stoppage of  Work. The strikes of engineers  at Clement  Talbot&apos;s,North Kensington, and of boilermakers at Hull, are the most serious.    (6) Not Involving a Stoppage  of Work. A strike is threatened among the  engineersof London.         PART I.-THE MINERS&apos;  DEMAND AND THE SOUTHPORT CONFERENCE.   . The  demands  which  were formulated at the  Special Conference of the Miners&apos;Federation of Great Britain, held at Southport in the latter portion of last week, embodythe latest developments in the policy of this body, and are of such a character as to demandserious attention.  Reference  in this connection  may be made to a memorandum put before the Cabinet by this Department in September, 1918, on the question of the possible reactions of a serious  coal shortage this winter on  the Labour situation.  The  mainargument of that memorandum assumed the continuance of war conditions, and as suchis now, of course, out of date ; but  an Appendix which contained a history of the activitiesof the mining organisations during the war, and such&apos; other portions as  dealt with theattitude and feeling among the miners themselves, are still relevant, inasmuch as  theyindicate the background with reference to which the latest developments must be judged.    The first act of the Special Conference just terminated was to elect a new president and secretary, and the election by large majorities of such progressive leaders as Mr. Smillieand Mr. Frank Hodge  respectively, is in itself significant.   A resolution  was moved byMr. Adamson on behalf of the Executive Committee which demanded the full dischargeof all demobilised mine workers, and, so  soon as they are able to work, their reinstatementin the mine which they left to join the colours : that such as are not able now to do a fullday&apos;s work should be  paid at the full rate  they would have received had they not enlisted ;that those unable to return to the mines should receive training for some other occupation,and an amount equivalent to what they would have earned in the  mines during  their(C 1635)  120  1/19  H&amp;SA
 period of training ;  that displaced men should receive from State funds an out-of-work allowance equal to what they would have earned in the mines;  and that the allowances or wages referred to above should not interfere with any pensions to which discharged soldiers or sailors might be entitled.   The most important clauses, however, are the last three.   The first of  these outlines policy as regards control., and is to the effect that &quot; all matters coming within the above proposals shall be first dealt with by the joint pit com- mittees of mine owners and mine workers, and if necessary submitted to the district joint committees.&quot;  This is rounded off and the question of shorter working hours dealt with in the second : &quot; In order to make easier the realisation of these demands wre press the Government to amend the Mines (Eight Hours) Act, so that six hours shall be substituted for eight hours in the Act; also,  for this purpose, and in the interests of the miners in particular and the community  in general, we urge  the Government to proceed at once to the nationalisation of all mines and minerals.&quot;  The third indicates methods of obtaining these ends, and. is to the effect that &quot; the Executive Committee should interview the  Prime Minister, or some other  Government representative,  on these proposals, and,  failing a satisfactory answer,  a further conference be convened to determine the policy to be adopted to realise  these  demands.&quot;  This last  clause should be read  in  connection with the remarks of  the President (Mr. Smillie), who is reported to have said that &quot; he was with Mr. Herbert  Smith (Vice-president)  in  giving direct intimation   .   .  .   that miners were going to have a 6-hour day.   If they were told the Government could not see their way to legislation within six  months, or twelve months, or 20 years, because they were not agreed, they should be told that the miners would call a conference and fix a date. .   .  .  He  had always  believed  in industrial action.   Shorter  hours  might  mean rearrangement of rates for piece work to  enable the men to earn as much as they earned for longer hours of work  .   .  .   .&quot;     Finally another resolution recommended by the Executive Committee was put before the conference, calling for &quot;a 30  per cent, advance on present earnings other than war&apos; wages, and war wages to be continued.&quot;     It is reported  that  district meetings  were held  to decide on  the voting  on this recommendation.  In certain quarters it appears to have been considered that 30 per cent. was too moderate a  demand,  and that Lancashire in particular wanted it increased to 50&apos; per cent.  The recommendation, however, was carried by 512,000 votes to 238,000.  It is reported that Lancashire, South Wales  and the Forest of Dean stood out for the higher amount.  As the membership of the three districts referred to above amounts quite to the figure for dissentients, it would appear that practically all dissent was.on the ground that the demand proposed by the Executive Committee was too moderate, and Mr. Straker, Chairman of the Business Committee,  in fact stated that this was so.   A further resolution was passed to the effect that the Miners&apos; Federation Committee should be asked to &quot; take the necessary steps to call the Triple Alliance together immediately to formulate a policy to  frustrate the efforts now being made to hand  back to private ownership the control of mines, railways and shipping     It has been suggested in  the Press that the effect of the demand for a 30 per cent- increase alone would be to add, other things being equal, from 35 to 45 millions to the wages  bill of the mines, or 3.s. to 5s. to the price per ton of coal, and these estimates are believed to be roughly correct.   The effect of the reduction of hours worked by 25 per cent., cannot be estimated, as it is impossible to predict with any certainty what  effect such a reduction would have  on the  amount per man of coal got.    It will be realised, then, that if these demands are pressed they will open up questions of the  gravest importance; and there seem  to  be the strongest grounds for supposing that they will be pressed. The Miners&apos; Federation  has for a  considerable time been consolidating its position with a view to such eventualities, and now is very strong, apart even from the unique position afforded by the pivotal character  of the industry.   Thus, during the war membership has been increased, and, more important than this, organisation has been tightened with a view to national as opposed to local negotiations with employers.The mine owners  before the war had successfully resisted the attempts of the miners to institute national collective bargaining and national settlements ;  but during the war this principle was conceded by the Coal Controller, and the Federation has now decided to allowno local wage settlements without its consent.   Other circumstances also place the miners in a peculiarly strong position, even among the great pivotal industries.  Thus, the natureof the  work performed tends  to separate them from other workers and to throw  themvery much together  themselves.   The results of this have been seen on occasion in theircomparatively small susceptibility to public opinion.  Again, it is a fact that at the presenttime they can look back on a practically unbroken series of successes won during the warover employers and  the Government  by strikes or threat of strikes.  Finally it may be
                             PART II. PKESS COMMENTS.                            (1) Labour and Socialist Press.                              (A) Peace  Conference, &amp;c.     On the whole there is less reference to the Peace Conference this week.   &quot; Forward &quot; and  the  &quot; Herald &quot;  maintain their  faith in President Wilson.  Mr. Lansbury, in the   Herald,&quot; reiterates his appeals to British Labour to stand by the President, the choice before the world being a peaceful, orderly revolution such  as the President desires, or a long period of revolutionary violence.   &quot; Forward &quot;  seems to be confident that the policy of a League of  Nations is in safe hands, also, among our British representatives at the Peace Conference.  Mr. Balfour&apos;s and Viscount Grey&apos;s adhesion is on record, and on Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s general attitude the  paper  thinks  there is no doubt.  &quot;The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot;  takes the opposite view and contains a severe criticism by Miss Sylvia Pankhurst of. General Smuts&apos; proposals for a League of Nations. The Lausanne Conference.     The majority of papers mentioning the Conference are doubtful whether it will meet at all.  According to the &quot; Herald,&quot; the gravest matter is that some of the British delegates decline to attend, apparently on the ground  that they do not want to meet the Germans or Bolsheviks.  This, it is considered, is to  sacrifice policy to prejudice, and thereby to imperil the Internationale.  &quot;Justice&quot; and the  &quot;  Call&quot; think that the Conference is likely  to  be  abandoned.   &quot;If it  ever meets,&quot; says the &quot;Call,&quot;  its &quot;deliberations are assured of the derision its promoters deserve.&quot;                                 (B)  Foreign Affairs. The German  Revolution.    This  subject occupies most of the attention of  the papers this week.   &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;  and the  &quot; Herald &quot; do not approve  of  the Spartacus Group,  but they agree that it is the Allies&apos;  blockade policy which fosters the continuance of such a party.  In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; the Allies are reminded that they have often said during the war they  had no  quarrel Avith democratic Germany, but with  her autocratic  leaders.Mr. Ramsay  Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; thinks that the Allied Governments are not at.all anxious to put an end to the  suffering and strife in Germany.  In the  first place, &quot; the German Government at the Peace Conference might be a little awkward &quot; ; and secondly, the presence of machine guns on the Berlin streets keeps reaction and terror predominantIiere and so keeps the Coalition from falling away. Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; pointsput how the  revolutionaries in Germany have bowed to the facts and have realised  theneed for adjusting themselves to a hopeless outlook.  He agrees that it is the universaldespair of any justice or friendliness  from the victors which explains  the tactics of  theSpartacus Group.  He thinks, however, that most Germans  mean the new Germany &quot; tobe a genuine democratic ideal of a people which has done with aristocracy and militarism.&quot;    The &quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; support the Spartacus Group.  They    (C 1635)                                                                   A 2noted that, unlike most groups of producers, the result of their action as producers has acomparatively.small directly adverse effect upon them as consumers, since in general theyare able to obtain coal on specially favourable terms.    But, of course, the main strength of the position of the miners lies in the almost uniqueimportance of the industry.  In other industries,  when the resources of conciliation havebeen exhausted, it may be possible for the Government  to face  a strike.   In the greatpivotal industries, and especially in the coalmining industry in circumstances such as thepresent, this is extremely difficult.   In the decade before the war,  the trade union leadersfully realised this, and the strike weapon was accordingly used,  not  merely as in otherindustries as a means of coercing employers, but as a means of compelling State intervention in the general public  interest with  a view to securing legislative  sanction for their chiefclaims.    There is, then, every reason to suppose that the miners mean to make the most of thesituation which presents itself  at the  moment, and such a  determination&apos; undoubtedlypresents an extremely difficult problem for the Government to deal with.
are the Party which are struggling for the establishment of Socialism now and not in thedim future.  The &quot; Call &quot; adds that the &quot; Majority &quot; socialists have made the same mistakeas Kerensky made.  They do not realise that revolutions do  not stand still at  politicalupheavals ; economic changes must follow quickly.  It  behoves us to take to heart thelesson of Russia and Germany if we are to avoid their sufferings, for &quot; sooner or laterour turn will come.&quot;Russia.     That the policy of the British Government in regard to Russia appears to have been modified lately is noted with satisfaction.  The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; however, says  that theofficial suggestions of withdrawal &quot; at the earliest possible moment &quot; give no ground forany lessening of agitation to secure the right of Russian people to settle their own affairs.It is no secret that the  British Government  was  originally forced into intervention by the pressure of the  French Government,  which was acting  in the interests of French  bond-holders.   Their  intervention has resulted in consolidating the revolutionary parties inRussia.   This conclusion is also reached by other papers. Both the Mensheviks and theCo-operators, who were either bitter  opponents  of, or at any rate stood aloof from, theBolsheviks,  have  joined  them,  and  the Russian Government may now accurately  be described as representative of practically all the  anti-monarchical and revolutionary forcesin Russia.                                  (G) Home Affairs.The New Ministry.     The new Ministry  is  universally  condemned and many criticisms  are passed on themembers.   The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; &quot; Forward,&quot; and tlie  &quot; Call &quot; agree  in denouncing.Sir F. E. Smith&apos;s appointment as a public scandal, and the &quot; Call &quot; sees &quot; King &quot;  Carson&apos;sinfluence behind it.  &quot; Justice &quot; thinks that the new Ministry is a farce carefully contrivedby Mr. Lloyd George to throw ridicule on his rivals or enemies, and to strengthen his ownpersonal position.Labour Members of the Ministry.     In the opinion of &quot; Forward &quot; the Labour  appointments are insults to the  workingclasses,  and  cynically imply that Labour is there as a convenience and not*as an honouror a power.   Both this paper and the &quot; Call &quot; agree that the  Labour ministers are likelyto be shown the door by their  paymasters whenever  it is felt convenient.  They giveMr. Lloyd George his due in this that he knows their  value  and makes no secret of his&apos; thoughts.Discontent among Soldiers.     It is regarded as plain that newspapers have been told to cut out or  disparage anyfurther  accounts of the soldiers&apos; strikes,  and to give the impression  that everything is settled and the  men satisfied.  According  to the &quot; Herald &quot;  this is quite untrue.  The men sent up certain demands to the Premier of which  no notice has been  taken.  these include  demobilisation  according to  length of service and maintenance for men withoutjobs  to  be  furnished at the standard rates for the jobs  which they  followed  before enlistment. The Shorter Working  Week.     This subject is treated most fully in the &quot; Herald &quot; and &quot; Forward.&quot;  Both  papers attempt to discover  the root  aims  underlying the movement.   In  &quot; Forward &quot; it is thought that the  demand for shorter hours covers  two ends: one,  the  abolition of  all unemployment so that when there is no fringe of unemployed, Labour will be able to make its own terms;  secondly, an increase in wages,  so that Labour may share in the results  of the increased production which  Capitalism demands and to which Labour is not averse-under certain conditions.  This second end ultimately aims at the elimination of profit.   The &quot; Herald  &quot;  thinks that the movement is due primarily to a feeling on the part of the men that they and their officials have been deceived by the employers;  secondly, that in  many centres there is a strong suspicion that the ballot was &quot; wangled &quot; and also the certain knowledge that half the men did not know what they were voting for.  It considers that  there can  be no peace until the original demand for  a  44-hour week is, conceded and the method of working it determined by the people principally affected.
                  (2) Daily Press  on Demobilisation and Resettlement.                         (A)  Discharge of Munition Workers. Number  of Discharges.     On  15th  January the &quot; Glasgow  Herald &quot;  reported that unemployment was still increasing in  Glasgow; on 1st January, 1,027,500  persons received  the unemployment donation.  At Coventry  the &quot; Coventry Herald &quot; (10th January) estimated that there were about 3,000 women and  1,500 men out of Work.   In  Sheffield,  on the other hand (&quot; Sheffield Telegraph,&quot; 17th January), unemployment is not so extensive as it was expected to be,  but the trade prospects are stated to be very unsatisfactory  as the engineering firms are not launching out into new developments.  &quot; It is for the Government to encourage a bolder policy.&quot; Unemployment Donation.     The  &quot; Times &quot;  (17th January) reports that about 1,000 claims  for unemployment donation are refused each week in  London.  Of the  cases sent to the  Courts of Refereesin London, about 75 per cent, are disallowed.  In the &quot; Railway Review &quot; (17th January)it is stated that in the textile industry the Labour Exchanges are proving a failure.  trade unionists hold that  the State  unemployment donation should he administered throughthe Unions.                 -     +1                           (B) Demobilisation  of the Army. Criticism of New Government Scheme.     The fact that the scheme of demobilisation has been changed arouses more criticism than the changes themselves.  The &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot; (16th  January)  says  &quot; We regard with some dismay the suggestion that the demobilisation scheme should be altered once more, just when it is beginning to work satisfactorily.&quot;  The &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; (17th January) hopes that the new scheme will prosper,  but adds &quot; how much better it would be to think first and choose one plan instead  of taking all the possible plans one after another.&quot;  Whatever the shortcomings of the latest scheme, the paper suggests that it should be stuck to, since less harm will he done by a third-rate scheme which lasts three months, than  by  second-rate schemes  which are  scrapped once a fortnight.  The &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot;  thinks that  the arrangement for release by  industrial groups was a good one, and confusion will follow if it is disregarded. Rate of Demobilisation.     The papers which formerly complained&apos; of delay in demobilisation are now becoming alarmed lest it may become too rapid.   The &quot;Daily Despatch &quot; (16th January) bases its anxiety on. the military fact that peace is not yet signed, and that the armistice terms have been dallied with by the Germans.  The &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; (16th January) thinks the  proposed rate of demobilisation will have very  evil  effects  on  the Army-of  what nature,  it  does not  say.  Major  General Sir F. \Maurice in  the &quot;Daily News&quot;  (17th January) complains  of the conflicting official  statements  as  to the  proposed rate of demobilisation; &quot; these conflicting announcements seem to show that the civil departments concerned are not in as close touch with the War Office  as they should be.&quot; Employment Outlook.     Several trades are referred to in the papers as needing increased labour. The&apos;&apos; Sheffield Independent &quot; (16th  January) reports that farm  labour is very scarce in  the West Riding. According to the &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; (15th January) the- Welsh steel and tinplate trades are crippled for lack  of men ; 14,000 men could easily be absorbed.   The &quot; Daily News &quot; (18th January) says that several thousand skilled workmen will very soon be required at Thanet, when the port passes from military to  civil  control.   With the prospect of full-time work in the Lancashire cotton trade, says the  &quot; Liverpool Post&quot; (14th January)it is becoming urgent that more textile workers should be demobilised.  Complaints arebeing made in North Lancashire that vacancies are being filled by munition workersinstead of by soldiers.  With regard to  coalminers, according to the &quot; South Wales News &quot;(14th January) the Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners&apos; Association has directedall colliery owners to engage only discharged soldiers and sailors  (as far as possible menwho were previously in their employment), unless they are otherwise instructed by theJoint District Demobilisation Committee.     (C 1635)                                                               A3
Dispersal Stations.    The &quot; Newcastle Chronicle &quot; (14th January) praises the efficiency of dispersal stations,and mentions the large amount of work done by one in London and one at Manchester&apos;.    The &quot; Birmingham Post &quot; (17th January) on the other hand, considers that dispersalcentres are really unnecessary and slow down the rate of demobilisation.  Their functionscould easily be performed by regimental  depots.                 PART III. GENERAL TOPICS AND DISTRICT REPORTS.                                    (A) General. General:  Current Demands.     At the moment, possibly the most far-reaching  and serious feature of the Labour situation  is the probable effect on industry of the miners&apos; demands, put forward at their conference at Southport during the week.  This matter is dealt with in Part I.     There are also signs of a growing impatience among railwaymen at the absence of any definite pronouncement by the Government on the future of British railways.  The matter is regarded as becoming  specially urgent with the approaching adoption of the 48-hour week, to come into force on 1st February, the details in connection with which have not yet  been arranged.     At a meeting of policemen at the Albert Hall on 19th January, it was resolved to insist upon full official recognition of their union, and also to demand an immediate increase of pay to all ranks of the police and prison officers in the United Kingdom.     A conference of the Unions catering for dock and waterside labour, was held in London on 17th January,  as a result of which the National Transport Workers&apos;  Federation were instructed to  make an application  to the employers  at  the various ports and  harbours of the country for a 44-hour week for day workers and a 41-hour week for night workers.     Postal workers of all grades are demanding, among other things, the establishment of a 42-hour week in the Post Office. Change Over.     It appears from special enquiries that have been  made that many circumstances are responsible, either combined  or separately, for any delay that exists in  the change over from war- to peace-time industry.  The most pronounced hindrance is said to be the shortage of skilled  labour ; this is largely ascribed to the delay in demobilising  pivotal and slip men.  Added  to the shortage of skilled men, some industries are also faced with a shortage of raw  material;  while  in  cases where  a certain  amount is available, employers  are unwilling  to buy at the present high prices.  Lastly,  it is noticeable that a considerable number of firms are refusing to  take any  steps in the matter of reverting to  peace-time work, even where the  hindrances already  mentioned  could be overcome, on the ground of the instability of conditions at present and the uncertainty of the outlook in the futureMr. Clynes and Mr.  Thomas  on the Labour Situation.    Recent speeches by  Mr.  Thomas and Mr. Clynes may be worth noting.  Mr. J. H. Thomas, speaking at Clerkenwell on 17th January, expressed grave apprehension as regards&apos;the industrial and economic position of the country at this moment.   Mr. Clynes,  speakingat Oldham on 18th January, expressed the  same opinion, and considered that this dis-content on the part  of Labour would be increased by the action of the Prime minister in sending as Labour representative to the Peace Conference a man who was not connectedwith the Parliamentary Labour  Party nor officially associated with  the Party  itself,  as this would be  regarded as a breach of a pledge.International Conferences.    A joint  meeting of Delegates * of the  American Federation  of Labour  and theParliamentary Committee of  the Trade Union Congress has been held in London duringthe last two days, as a result of  which it is reported that the Parliamentary Committee,while regarding  themselves  as  pledged  to send  representatives  to the InternationalSocialist Conference (which is now stated to be going to be held in the neighbourhood ofBerne sometime this month), have agreed to attend at a later date an International TradeUnion (as opposed to Socialist) Congress on the lines suggested by the American Federation.
North Western.    A certain amount of discontent is reported among the dockers at Liverpool, owing tothe non-demobilisation of the Dockers&apos; Battalion.  These men are paid the dockers&apos; fullstandard rate plus army pay, and this causes jealousy.   They have also been used whencivilian dockers were on strike.  This is the sort of thing which was possible under war conditions, but the advent of peace is bound to make the feeling against it much stronger.    In the engineering trade in Lancashire,  the alteration from 53 to 47. hours appears tobe working quite smoothly.  The most urgent problem is now the revision of the piece-                                (B) District Reports.London and South East.    A meeting of the National Administrative Council of the Shop Stewards and Workers&apos;Committee was held in  London on 17th  January.  The question of  summoning anational Conference of Shop  Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees to deal with a shorter working week was discussed;  it was recommended that such a Conference should boldlydemand a  30-hour week at once, as the Scotch miners  had done.  Eventually  it wasagreed that if a strike occurred anywhere in connection  with  the demand for a shorterweek, the National Administrative Council should be called together at once with  a viewto arranging a national strike.  At that moment news arrived that the Clyde workers had decided to strike on 27th January, and accompanying this announcement was a request that the National Administrative Council should take immediate national action.   It wasdecided to meet again on 20th January.  At this  further meeting,  the conclusion wasreached that the complaint on which the London Committee had brought the men out,did not justify a national strike; it was thought that the London strike  would &quot; fizzleout.&quot;  With  regard to the position in Glasgow, MacManus,  who had just  returned from there, reported that it was very doubtful how many would strike on 27th January,  and he advised National Administrative Council to wait and see what strength they could command in the  north  before taking any steps.    It is reported that the Ministry of Munitions has definitely rejected the Shop Stewards&apos;scheme for taking over the national aircraft  factory at  Waddon.  The factory will beretained only as  a salvage depot for obsolete aeroplanes, since the type of machine hithertomade there is no longer required.    A secret conference is reported to have been held in London on 18th January, convenedby the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee.   It  appears to be the aim of the members tobring about a^general strike in the near future.    A conference of Trade Unionists and Co-operators is to be  held this month to discussthe establishment of  &quot; Peopled Trusts &quot; ;  they will also consider the problem of jointcontrol of industry by consumers and producers together.    Trouble is reported at the F.I.A.T. works, Wembley, where the firm wish to dischargeskilled as well as unskilled workers.West Midlands.   .    Discussion is still proceeding in the black bolt and nut industry, and also in  thebrass trade, concerning  an increase of piece-work prices arising out of  the reduction in working hours.    In Coventry there is still a movement in favour of a 40-hour  week.  It is reported,however, that the Trade Unions are not  agreed on the action  to be taken and therefore.it is not proposed to press for the further reduction at present.  The skilled men at Coventryare reported to be making a detailed census,of all dilutees still  employed in the shops inthe neighbourhood.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    At Sheffield there is said to be considerable anxiety among firms in the cutlery trade,owing  to the continuance of  &quot; inflated  prices.&quot;  In, addition  although large orders  arebeing placed both with  the cutlery and  the electro-plate trades, the firms  are slow to execute them, the alleged  reason being the delay in securing the pivotal men for whomapplications have been made.  The labour unrest  which  seems  to be particularly inevidence at Coventry also accounts for the  hesitation of firms to embark on a peace-timeprogramme.    It is reported that the Nottingham City Council have decided to protest against the closing down  of  the ordnance factory which formerly employed 12,000 workpeople. Thesuggestion is made that  it might be used  as a telephone factory or a railway constructioncentre.           -

At that moment news arrived that the Clyde workers had decided to strike on 27th January, and accompanying  this announcement was a request that the National Administrative Council should take immediate national action.   It wasdecided to meet again on  20th  January.  At this  further meeting,  the conclusion wasreached that the complaint on which  the London Committee had brought the men out,did not justify a national strike ;  it was thought that the London strike  would  &quot; fizzleout.&quot;  With regard to the position in Glasgow, MacManus,  who had just  returned from.there, reported that it was very doubtful how many would strike on 27th January, and he advised National Administrative Council to wait and see what strength they could command in the north before taking any steps.    It is reported that the Ministry of  Munitions has definitely rejected the Shop Stewards&apos;scheme for taking over the national  aircraft factory at Waddon.  The factory  will beretained only as a salvage depot for obsolete aeroplanes, since the type of machine hithertomade there is no longer required.    A secret conference is reported to have been  held in London on. 18th January, convenedby the &quot; Hands off Russia &quot; Committee.   It appears  to be the aim of the members tobring about a^general strike in the near future.    A conference of Trade Unionists and Co-operators is to be held this month to discussthe establishment of &quot; People&apos;s  Trusts &quot; ;  they will also  consider the problem  of jointcontrol of industry by consumers and producers together.    Trouble is reported at the F.I.A.T. works, Wembley, where the firm wish to dischargeskilled as well as unskilled workers.West Midlands.  *    Discussion is still proceeding in  the black bolt and nut industry, and also in thebrass trade,  concerning an  increase of piece-work prices arising out of the reduction in working hours.     In Coventry there is still a movement  in favour of a  40-hour week.  It is reported,however, that the Trade Unions are not agreed on the action to  be taken and therefore.it is not proposed to press for the further reduction at present.  The skilled men at Coventryare reported to  be making a detailed  census of  all dilutees still employed in the shops inthe neighbourhood.Yorkshire and  East  Midlands.    At Sheffield there is said to be considerable  anxiety among firms in  the cutlery trade,owing to the continuance  of &quot; inflated prices.&quot;  In, addition although large orders arebeing  placed both with the cutlery and the electro-plate  trades, the  firms are  slow to execute them, the alleged reason being  the delay in securing the  pivotal men for whomapplications  have  been made.  The  labour  unrest which seems to  be particularly inevidence at Coventry also accounts for  the hesitation of firms to embark on a peace-timeprogramme.     It is reported that the Nottingham City Council have decided to protest against the closing down of the ordnance factory which formerly employed 12,000 workpeople.  Thesuggestion is made that it might be used as a telephone factory or a railway constructioncentre.           -North Western.    A certain amount of discontent is reported among the dockers at Liverpool, owing tothe non-demobilisation of the Dockers&apos; Battalion.  These men are paid the dockers&apos; fullstandard rate plus army pay, and this causes jealousy.   They have also been used whencivilian dockers were on strike.  This is the sort of thing which was possible under war conditions, but the advent of peace is bound to make the feeling against it much stronger.    In the engineering trade in Lancashire,  the alteration from 53 to 47. hours appears tobe working quite smoothly.   The most urgent problem is now the revision of the piece-
 worker&apos;s wages in relation to the reduced hours.  In Barrow, also, the new hours seem to be working well, although there is some agitation  in  Manchester, Liverpool and Barrow for a still further reduction.     Regarding the change-over from war to peace work in Manchester it is reported that orders for new ships are not plentiful, and this causes some slackness in the shipyards and in the engineering industry..  A  large number of new undertakings are contemplated, but they are stated to be hung up partly because  of the difficulty in getting building done, and partly  owing to the Treasury restrictions on capital subscriptions.  In the Furnishing Trades as the firms making aeroplanes complete their contracts they are $turning  their men over to the normal pre-war work. Northern.     The trouble among the boilermakers, &amp;c, on the North-East Coast threatens to extend, the cause being the reduction in the earnings of piece and lieu workers.  A conference of Shipyard Trade Unions was held at Newcastle on  15th January.  There is reported  to have been  a distinct feeling at  the meeting that the employers had not respected the condition attached to  the  agreement  as to  shorter hours, which provided that wages should not be reduced.   A resolution was passed advising a resumption of work, provided employers agree to maintain the rate of wages of piece and lieu workers.  The meeting also pressed, for the introduction of the two-break system.  At  a meeting of the Shop Stewards at South Shields on the same day, a resolution was likewise passed pressing for the two-break  system ; in the event of a refusal, the shop stewards&apos;  representatives were advised to demand a 44-hour week, and no reduction in wages. South Wales.     Some difficulty is evident in this area in connection with the change-over from war to peace industry in the tin plate and iron and steel trades.   Brisk business is anticipated, but the  shortage of coal and the delay in demobilisation  are stated to be  hampering employers.  In the coal industry the reabsorbtion of released men is said to  be rendered difficult owing to lack of transport and the need for providing working places in the pits.Scotland.    The question of a  shorter working week has become more prominent on the Clyde lately.  At  a meeting held at Glasgow attended by  the local executives of all the unionsaffiliated to the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation,  a resolution was passed in favour of a 40-hour week.   No action was to be taken to enforce this decision, however,until the opinion of the C.W.C. was made known at a meeting held on 18th January.   Atthis latter meeting, it  was agreed that a 47-hour week was too long, but no alternativedemand  could  be agreed upon.   Eventually the whole matter  was referred to a specialcommittee.   Since that date that  a  more serious  situation appears possibly to  have arisen ; a fresh meeting of the executive has apparently decreed a  strike for 27th january to compel the introduction of a 40-hour week with no reduction of pay.

At the        British Lighting and Ignition Company&apos;s works, which were stated ,to have been involved in        the strike, work will be resumed on 23rd January.    * Since this was written, this strike after becoming more or less general, is reported to have been settled, the demand having been conceded.
            The Hull shipwrights and. boilermakers are still on strike and refuse to go back until the        employers guarantee to prevent any reduction in piece and lieu workers&apos; wages.  The engineers        at Middlesboro, who were on strike against the one-break system have now resumed work.            No settlement has been reported of the dispute in the puddling industry at the Netherton        and Brierly Hill districts.(b)  Not Involving a Stoppage of Work    The Coal  Controller has no  cases  to report;.Reported from other sources.            The most serious strike is threatened among  the  electrical engineers in London and the        provinces, in connection with the interpretation of the 47-hour agreement.            At Belfast  the men employed in the engine shops and shipyards have begun to hand in        notices in support of their demand for a 44-hour week..
