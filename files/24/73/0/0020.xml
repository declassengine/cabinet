                    No. 5 GROUP, DOVER PATROL.                              (Overseas Unit.)    The weather during the period under  review  (October  1st Novembti11 th)  has been generally unfavourable for flying.    The following units ceased to operate with No.  5 Group from  Octobei21st:-Nos. 38, 204, 210, 214 and 218 Squadrons.    An advanced landing ground and depot for petrol, bombs and small armammunition was established at Ghistelles Aerodrome on October 21st.    Forward Wireless  Stations were established at Ghistelles, UytkerkeVarssenaere Aerodromes on October 17th, 20th and 28th respectively.    Advanced  Headquarters  61st  Wing  were established  at  VarssenaeiiAerodrome on October 27th.  ,  Aerodromes lately occupied  by  the  enemy have, generally speakingbeen found  to be in good  condition.   In  nearly all cases the hangers havebeen destroyed, but the living accommodation has mostly remained intact,    No. 471 Flight has been operating with the 61st Wing since October 28tl    Hostilities ceased at 11 o&apos;clock on November 11th in accordance withterms of the Armistice granted to  the  enemy.  Anti-submarine patrols andescort patrols were maintained owing to the possibilities of hostile submarinestill working, and for reporting drifting mines.                           RECONNAISSANCE.     At the beginning of October a marked decrease in activity was noticeabl at Bruges, there  being  only three damaged destroyers in the harbour, aboil the usual number of T.B.&apos;s, and no submarines as far as could be ascertained On October 6th the presence of a new outer boom  at Ostende was definite] established, and there appeared to be no shipping in  the harbour.     No torpedo craft or submarines were seen at  Zeebrugge,   The &quot; Brussels which used to be at the shore end of the Mole, was seen  to be alongside clos to the outer end.     From October 5th there  had  been  little or no enemy  shipping on tin Flanders  coast, it being confined to C.M.B.&apos;s, barges and a  few small cargi steamers.     Photographic plates  exposed  over  the  Ghent-Termonde-Lokeren arci show that the enemy were making every  endeavour  completely to  destroy-the various aerodromes that were now too close  to the front line to be of an] value.     St. Denis Westrem and Mariakerkc had both been ploughed over tin whole surface with transverse furrows about 30 feet apart, and high explosiw charges had been detonated at frequent  intervals, causing a  number of larg craters well spread over the landing grounds.  In the same way all the railway) lines  were systematically destroyed, or prepared for destruction, as  soon necessary.     A new aerodrome  was found at  Tennonde  with a considerable numbs of hostile scout machines visible.                          BOMBING  RAIDS.    Objects of military importance have been attacked with  success wfeconditions were suitable, and considerable damage effected to machines apersonnel.
                        ENEMY  AIRCRAFT.   Engagements with enemy aircraft have resulted in 32 enemy machinesking destroyed, and 15 driven down.  Total, 47.   On October 4th 17 Camels of 213 Squadron, whilst on high offensive patrolattacked 15 Fokker biplanes E. of Roulers, which were reinforced by five otherFokker biplanes.   During the fight that ensued Captain C. P. Brown destroyed three, oneiu flames, and two others confirmed as crashed.  Another was shot down inflames by  Lieut.  A.  H. Turner, and three others were crashed by CaptainJ. E.  Greene  and Lieuts. Chick and Hancocks.   Meanwhile Lieuts.  Uptonand Holden had become detached  from the  formation and were attacked byeight  Fokker biplanes.  Lieut. Upton was shot down in flames.  Lieut. Holdcnspun  down to  800 feet, when he stalled and  shot down  a  machine which wasdiving after him,  which crashed N.W. of Roulers,  and another enemy aircraftovershot its dive when he stalled, and dived  straight into the ground.  In all we destroyed nine machines.   One of our machines did not return.   No. 210 Squadron attacked nine Fokker biplanes  and two triplanes onOctober 8th in the vicinity of Roulers,  which  were  reinforced by a furtherseven Fokker  biplanes  and  one monoplane. A  fierce fight ensued,  duringwhich Captain Swale shot down a Fokker biplane in flames,  and three others were  destroyed by Lieuts. Gyles, Pineau and 2nd  Lieut. Berry.  We lost twomachines.   A high offensive patrol of No. 213 Squadron were attacked on October 14thby 14 Fokker biplanes and two Fokker triplanes.  The Camels were hampered by carrying Cooper bombs.  One enemy aircraft  was shot down by Lieut. Sims,which crashed  at Leke.   The wing of another was shot away by Lieut. Hodson,which crashed at Beerst, and  a third was  destroyed  by Lieut.  Mackenzie.Three others were shot down  out of control.   We  lost three machines.   On the same date a patrol of 213 Squadron  attacked two Fokker triplancsand 15 Fokker biplanes  over Ardoye.  One was  shot down, and spun into thebouses at Thourout, by Captain Greene and Lieut. Macleish, U.S.N.R.F.

Redcar, September 29th-D.H. 6 Aeroplane No. 7657 (Pilot, Lieut. H. C, k)k) whilst on patrol sighted the periscope of a submarine in position 54c28&apos; N. &quot;&apos; 80&apos; W.    Course was altered to the position,  upon which one 100-lb. bomb  was dropped on the spot where the periscope disappeared.  No result was observed.    Portland,  September 30th.-Short Seaplane No.  1259 whilst on  patrol, at 1400 sighted the periscope of a submarine  about five miles distant on the starboard bow, in 31  G.   The submarine was steering N.E. at  a high speed, leaving a prominent wake.  The periscope disappeared, and two bombs were dropped, which exploded 300 yards ahead, and on either side of the oil patch left by the submarine on submerging.    The Seaplane communicated with a Hydrophone  Division which  was cruising in the vicinity.    Nothing further was observed, and no  sound of a  submarine was heard by Hydrophone trawlers.    Dunkirk, October 5th. (217 Squadron 61st Wing) Aeroplane D.H. 4 D.8333 whilst  on patrol, at 1105,  sighted  a submarine half  blown  in position 510 29&apos; N. 20 37&apos; W.  The submarine dived on the approach of the aeroplane, but two 230-lb. bombs were dropped on the position,  one of  which  exploded 30 feet from the hull.  The other failed to explode.&apos;   After the sea had closed over the conning tower no trace of the submarine could be seen owing to the roughness of the sea.   Killingholme, October 14th.-Large America Seaplane K.  21 (Pilot, Lieut.R. H.  McCann) whilst  on patrol, at 0903 sighted a periscope in position20 miles due  north of Flamboro&apos;.  Two 230-lb. bombs were  dropped, which fell 50 yards to starboard of the periscope.   Bubbles rose to the surface, but no further results of the attack were observed.  The area was circled for some time, after which the seaplane was forced to land owing to engine trouble, and taxied into Scarborough.

The  submarine,  which  was  attacked  by  Black burn  K an garciAeroplane No. 9983 (Pilot, Lieut. Waring; Observer, Lieut. Smith) onAugJL28th, from Seaton Carew, is now known by the Admiralty to have been sunk,    A  submarine has been identified as having been present  on the followiifive occasions, and the attacks have been classified by the Naval Intelligence                           HOME  WATERS.    Anglesey, April 24th-Airship  SS.Z.  34 (Pilot, Flight Sub.-Lieut.  JuiFarina) in position about 30 miles east of Kingstown, sighted an object haviithe appearance of a periscope about 3 feet out of water, travelling at aboisix knots, leaving a slight  &quot; V &quot; shaped ripple behind it.   One 1004b. borawas dropped from 400 feet, hitting some object below the surface about 6 febehind the supposed periscope.  The bomb failed to explode,  but all membeof the  crew heard a distinct metallic clang, as the bomb disappeared uiidthe surface.   A 2304b.  bomb was then dropped, apparently securing a direhit on some object close under the  surface, and causing.a large explosion, whitlifted the Airship from 1,200 to 2,000 feet.  Owing to the height  and the fclosing in the Airship lost the  position  and no further observations could 1made.    Killingholme,  June 13th.-Large America Seaplane,  No. 4343  (PilotLieut.  Cleeve  and Ensign  Allen) whilst on patrol sighted the wash of a sulmarine  off Spurn steering N.N.E.   Two  bombs were dropped.   Destroyswere called up, and depth charges were dropped.  Bubbles continued to risbut nothing further was observed.    Killingholme, July  9th. Large  America Seaplane No.  4336  bombedsuspicious wake in 24  S.

NunObserver, A.  C. Hosken) whilst on routine patrol, observed a submerged somarine proceeding across  the bows of  a  French battleship  escorted  by t&apos;destroyers.    One 2304b. bomb was dropped which exploded about 30 feet behind tsubmarine.    At this moment a torpedo track from the submarine was seen travel in the  direction of the ship.  After the explosion of the bomb, bubbles, jjand a certain amount of what appeared to  be wreckage appeared on the surfai    The position was searched by  the destroyers, but nothing furtherseen of the submarine.
&apos;CC:nshieinelite   Malta, May 19th.-Large America Seaplane No. N. 4312 (Pilots,  Captain J. Vincent and Captain Ball) whilst on patrol, at 1735 an enemy submarine  s sighted 50 miles south of base steering North East.   One 230-lb. bomb  was dropped which exploded 10 yards to starboard the wash made by the submarine on submerging.    A second 230-lb. bomb s dropped at 1738, which exploded in  the wash  made by  the submarine.  rose to the surface, and the position  was searched for 20 minutes, but thing  further was  observed.                 FRENCH  NAVAL  AIR SERVICE.   Daring the month of September, the French Naval Air Service (excluding itc Balloons)  have  carried out 3,161 Anti-submarine patrols,  covering a stance of 395,710  miles.   Of this distance 338,520 miles have been flown by aplanes and Aeroplanes,&apos; and 57,190 miles by  Airships.   Submarines have been  attacked  on nine occasions.   The following arc details of the  attacks :-   Aviero, September 5th. A  patrol was sent out to investigate the cause explosions heard  at sea.   A, submarine emerged three miles from Aveiro and opened fire on a vessel achorcd off the coast a few miles south of Aveiro.  After having fired about U rounds, the  submarine dived, apparently, having seen the aircraft.  Four wnbs were dropped on the submerged submarine which caused large patches oil to rise to the surface.   The patrol returned to Base at 1835 to fetch more Ojhbs and started out again at 1848 to search the position previously attacked. calm yellowish patch was observed in the position which appeared as though ie submarine were stationary on the bottom.  Nothing further was observed, id the machines returned  to Base.  Bizerte, September 10th. A section of Seaplanes whilst on patrol observeddisturbance terminated by a white patch of air bubbles.  Four bombs weretopped on the suspected position,  all of which exploded well, but caused no(parent result.  .  Base was informed by W/T and a convoy warned by the machines, whichterwards returned to  Base.   Aveiro, September 13th.  -Whilst on patrol, at 1228, a patrol of machines Jscrved what appeared to be the conning tower of a submarine 25 miles S.W. &apos; Aveiro.  On  approaching  the  position  the  conning tower  disappeared, &quot;it a periscope followed by.a &quot; V &quot; shaped wash was still visible.  Two bombs fere dropped,  after which an oily Upheaval appeared.  One machine returned  Base owing to engine trouble, and the other searched the position bombed, &apos;ut observed  nothing further.   Lion-sur-Mer, September 13th.-Aeroplane  L.1  whilst  returning  from Porting a convoy, at 1830 sighted a submarine on the surface heading North. foe  Aeroplane altered course, and the submarine dived.  The atmospheric editions made attack difficult,  but two bombs were dropped, which exploded y, and  100 metres ahead of the disturbance  left by the  submarine on sub- nerging. The area was searched for some time until the Aeroplane was forced  return to Base owing to bad weather and failing light.
