MONTHLY REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.

December, 1918.

I circulate for the information of the War Cabinet the following brief account of tho work of the Board of Trade during the month of December, 1918, which deals only with a few of the more important questions likely to interest my colleagues and does not profess to be an account of the ordinary departmental work of the Board, or to include all the important questions considered by the Department.

9th January, 1919. A. H. Stanley.

COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY.

All the remaining types of Egyptian cotton which had been specially reserved for military purposes have now been released for exportation to the Allies for ordinary civil purposes. In order to assist the French in purchasing their requirements of the higher grades of cotton for use in districts formerly occupied by the enemy, the Cotton Central Commission have been instructed to see that for the present as much of these grades is allocated for export to France as to this country.

The policy of removing as many as possible of the existing prohibitions of exportation and replacing them by prohibitions applicable only to exportation to the countries bordering on Germany, which are subject to blockade restrictions, has been continued. Apart from restrictions on the exportation of raw materials, foodsttuffs, dyes and certain chemicals, the remaining absolute prohibitions are now not numerous and are being steadily reduced.

For the purpose of the Export prohibitions Spain, Greece,and Morocco have been removed from the list of countries which are regarded as subject to blockade restrictions.

The exportation of a limited number of articles has now with the approval of the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee been made free of restrictions to all destinations except Switzerland.

Belgium has been placed in the same category as France from the point of view of export restrictions and trade with that country (except in those articles whose exportation or importation is prohibited to or from all countries) no longer requires a special licenoe.

So far as the restrictions on importation are concerned comparatively few articles whose importation was previously prohibited except under licence have been excepted from this requirement during the last month, the most important being coffee and tobacco.
     The question of action to be  taken in regard  tocontracts entered into before  the  war  or mtUe  early days of the war,  and uncompleted owing to circumstancesarising out of tho war, has &quot;been under consideration,and a memorandum has been prepared dealing with  domesticoontracts, contracts relating  to Allied Temtonesoccupied by the enemy and those relating to other  Alliedterritory.   The question will bo  considered at  a  mooting,of the Board of Trade advisory Council on January  8th.     A circular telegram has been sont toliis Majesty&apos;representatives as to the relaxation of certain  restric-tions and instructing them to advertise widoly the factthat orders can now ho placed  in this country with everychance of such orders boing executed speedily.     During the month the Demobilisation Section of theDepartment of Overseas Trade has continued to receiveana examine applications for the immediate demobilisation of pivotal men who aro rcquirod to proceed overseas,  andhas forwarded recommendations  on such applications to theMinistry  of Labour for transmission to the ftar Office.     Arrangements have been made with tho Passport Officeand the Ministry of Shipping for the grant of priority intho issue of passports and the allocation of steamerberths to men &quot;proceeding to ports abroad, who jjavo boondemobilised on the recommendation of the]X$artment     Baring the month two applications under TemporaryYlar Legislation have been heard for the  rant of licencesin respect of copyrights owned by subjects of enemy states.   One of&quot; those related to an important work onpsychiatry&quot; by Dr. Kraepclin.   This book deals with                                                     ;ing                                 present time,    a licenoOto publish a translation of the work vail be granted indue course.     Sir John Snell has now been appointed to act asadviser to the Board of Trade on all matters arising outof tho Report of the ilelectric Power Supply Committee,,Progress has been made with the drafting of the Bill basedon the recommendations of that Committee, and this is nmin an advanced state *   The various departments concerned are being&apos; approached with a view to securing that noloans shall bo approved for electricity purposes unless these can be shown not to conflict with the principles the now proposals for tho supply of electricity on anational scale.of     The scheme for the amalgamation of these two compelieghas now been approved by sufficient majorities of therespective shareholders and effootive co-operation has been commenced.   Per the present a Holding Company has beenformed which is acquiring the shares of the two compaaiesconcerned *
   The nominations to the Trade and Licensing Committeewhich is to be set up under the scheme outlined in theWhite Paper recantiv laid before Parliament  have nowbeen received and the Committee will he appointedimmediately.   The Loan and Grant Allocation Committeewill he purely departmental in constitution  and thisCommitted will he formed concurrently with the  Tradeand Licensing Committee.   Lord Colwyn has acceptedthe chairmanship of the Trade and Licensing  Committee.                    aim mm   The tonnage situation as regards the Soandin-avian countries remains easy.   As regards the  north atlantic route, the position shows hut little improvement.Tonnage has been released hut the freights asked are ona scale which prevents the shipment of Wood  pulpin competition with Scandinavia.   The Paper Controller tis in negotiation with the Ministry of Shipping with a viewto arranging for the release of ships adapted for carrying -wood pulp and for the provision of other tonnage atsuitable rates.   As a start two ships have  been released and the Controller expects to arrange with&apos; their ownersfor reasonable rates of freight.   Against an  estimated maximum requirement of 2,600 tons*some 2^000 tons only were manufactured to the Controllersorder, and this quantity has been sufficient to supply alldemands upon the &quot;basis arranged.   The re are a few remnantsfordispo&amp;aX. but the difference between the  controller^ ^prices and those ruling; in the market is suoh as tojustify the assurance thai there will be no  less orliability in the matter.     5he amounts paid tin to the&quot;Controller1a accountduring December amounted to  617,980*10.9 compared with-. . 127,000 for November,arrangement with regard to imports of moist mechanicalpulp, it is calculated that the licenced importspermitted by the new regulations will amount to some600,000 tons compared with 530.000 tons, the actual dead  :weight estimated to have been imported during the oalendaryear 1918,   Of this not less than 1&amp;0,000 tons are estimateto have been destined for1 Government use, while for 1919 &apos;thiamount is estimated at 50,000 tons only.   Thus the increasein the quantity of paper available for commercial purposeswill be at a greater rate than is represented by theincrease in the.amount of iiports.    According to the bestintormation available, the  stocks of paper-making materials       country at the present time are higher than theynave been at any time since 1915.
     Ordors restricting tho publication of nowperiodicals and nowspapcrs have boon withdrawn.Tjmm SUPPM1B,     Tho control of timbor has boon greatly relaxedsince tho last Reoort,   Permits aro no longer necessaryfor the purchase of any kind of timbor in tho UnitedKingdom, nor are they required for dealing in Hardwood,Rattan and Malacca Canes abroad, except for importationinto the United Kingdom.   Maximum prices are retained,and tho Pitwood Order 1918,  is unalterod.   fho PackingOaso and Lapping Boards Order,  restricting tho use of ;imported timDor for thoso articles has boon revoked,together with tho  Order which made the export of timboifrom Ireland subject to permit.       The  restrictions  imposed upon  the use of motor spirit* by tho Motor Spirit. Restriction&quot;Orders,  which were sus- ponded for  the Christmas  holidays have now been entirely revoked..       Tho  licensing  system will remain in force until Sections  15 and  io  of  the Finance Act, 1916 have been repealed,   The  Potrol Control Department have, however, &quot;announced that they are; prepared to issue licences to new applicants,  am to increase the quantities of potrol allocated to existing  licence holdors, and they will endeavour as far as possible to meet all reasonable requirements.     Since the signing of &quot;tho Armistice the work of the department of Horse Supplies and Transport has been con-si aerably reduced,   It has been found&quot;possible to with-draw all the Orders necessitated by the Control with theexception only of &quot;Tho Horses Rationir^ Order&quot;, governing the feeding of cereals, and &quot;The Hay and Straw Order&quot; re-gala ting tho use of these commodities.      So far as  cereals aro concerned,  the  supplies  are getting bettor  ovory day,    Tho  arrivals of  foreign oats and  maize  are increasing,  and as the Jziglish crop of  oats last year  was exceptionally good and comparatively  few have up to now  foiuid their way to  the market  except for soed purposes no  further trouble in this respect need bo anticipated.      The situation  in regard to  hay is not so favourable, Last year?s  crop has  not&quot; turned  out so well  as was at onp time oxpoctod, and although  tho  demands upon  it for tM&quot;Army horses  in Franco  are &quot;becoming less it would not bo*:safe  to increase, the  present very low ration  for civil horses, and, in fact,  it is  foared that on the basis of that \ration  there will not be sufficient hay to sco us throughuntil this year&apos;s crop is available unless the quantity issupplemented by some  imports.   The Army Authorities arobeing asked  to import some hay from Canada direct to franco,as they did  in tho first two years of tho War, so that thewhole of tho hay in this Country may bo left for civilneeds.
