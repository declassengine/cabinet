In view of the importance which the movement for shorter working hours has recentlyassumad,  it may be useful to summarise the main developments which have occurredrecently, and which centre practically entirely round the 47-hour week agreement in theengineering and shipbuilding trades.    The implications  of, and considerations involvedin such a  movement, it will be remembered, were dealt with from a general point of viewtwo weeks ago.    At the outbreak of war, negotiations in connection with a reduction in hours of labour,which had been in progress for some time between the  Federation of Engineering and shipbuilding Trade Unions and the Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Association,were suspended pending a more favourable opportunity.   Towards the end of 1918, theopportunity seemed to have arrived, and negotiations between the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation and the men&apos;s&apos; representatives were resumed, resulting in the Employers&apos;Federation agreeing to the principle of  a shorter working week, but without committing themselves to any definite number of hours.   On 17th October the *Engineering Employers&apos;Federation came to a similar agreement, and it was arranged that the conference of theExecutive of the Unions concerned should jointly meet  the Employers&apos; Federations onthe afternoon of the 1st November.    * This  organisation has now joined the National Employers&apos; Federation, to form the &quot; Engineering and national Employers&apos; Federation.&quot;   (G 1628) 120  1/19  H&amp;SSUMMARY.PAET I. GENERAL REMARKS.
    Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation atwhich the A.S.E.* was also represented,  held on the morning of  the 1st November thefollowing recommendations were agreed to :     &quot; That the 44-hour  week should consist of one  break with a 12  o&apos;clock stop on        Saturdays.&quot;    &quot; That the negotiating committee should report back  to  a similar meeting as that        assembled to report any resolution or proposal that may tentatively  be agreed        upon ; and that  the 44 hours should only be accepted.&quot;    &quot; Also that the hours question should be negotiated separately from any other matter        requiring consideration.&quot;    The joint meeting held on the afternoon of the same day resulted in an agreement that the &quot; Joint Committee should act together at once and deal  with the matter.&quot;    On the 19th November the following memorandum was issued to the Employers&apos; andWorkpeople&apos;s organisations:     &quot; Having  regard to  the sudden  cessation  of  hostilities  the  representatives of the        Employers are prepared to recommend, and the Federations and the representa-        tives of the Trade Unions agree to recommend their constituents, that the working        week should be reduced to 47 hours on the one break system, to come into effect        on the 1st January, 1919,  subject to the following  conditions :-      &quot; 1. Other working conditions shall be meantime maintained.      &quot; 2. Present weekly time rates shall apply to the reduced working week.      &quot;3. The Unions will take all possible steps to ensure that in the critical state          through which the country has to pass, the greatest possible output will be          secured and maintained.      &quot; 4. The economic conditions and systems and  base of remuneration necessary in          the interests of industry shall be the subject of early consideration and the          parties agree to deal with these conditions from a broad national standpoint.      &quot; 5. Provisions for avoiding disputes shall be immediately entered into with all the          Trade Unions.&quot;    The memorandum was signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the two Employers&apos;Federations  represented  and by the Chairman of  the A.S.E. and the Secretary of theFederation.    On the following day the men  signified their approval of the agreement by passing the following resolution,  namely: &quot; That the  offer  of a 47-hour week and the conditionsconstitute a reasonable attempt  to re-adjust the working  conditions of the shipbuilding and Engineering  Trades  and recommend their acceptance to all the members of all theUnions  concerned.&quot;.    At the same time it  was decided to submit the matter to a ballot of the constituentUnions  and to pool the results.  The voting resulted in. a majority of roughly two to one in favour of the proposal.  Out of 41 unions whose votes were recorded only seven returnedmajorities against the proposal.  Among these the most important were  the Boilermakersand the Shipwrights, and in each of these cases the number against was not far short of double the number who  voted in favour of the proposal.   It is not without significancethat boilermakers in general work on piece rates,  and although the shipwrights did not do so before the war, this custom has altered, and at the present, time in some of the shipyard districts the majority do.   It is clear that men  on piece rates are much moredrastically affected by the alteration in hours than are those on time rates.  The suggestion was made that shorter hours would not adversely affect output, and the time worker canstill regard this as a more or less academic matter, but the piece  worker is made to feelany reduction in output on his part immediately.  The other important body which voted against  the proposal was the National Amalgamated  Union  of Labour, whose memberscomprise the  bulk of the unskilled shipyard workers on  the North-East Coast.  Here,however, the majority against was nothing like so large 17,000 as against 15,Q00.  1    The total skilled workers including  members of the A.S.E. who voted in favour ofthe 47-hour agreement was 164,000 as against 88,000 voting against it.  If members pf theA.S.E. be omitted the figures were 128,000 as against 61,000.  This seems to show  thatthe members of the A.S.E. were just about as much divided on the question as were themembers  of the o*ther unions involved.   The number  of unskilled workers who voted infavour  of the proposal  was 172,000 as  against 71,000, which shows a  slightly greaterpreponderance than is the case with the  skilled men.   Of  the unskilled  men only 30 percent, voted against the proposal, whereas of the skilled 35 per cent. Voted against it.    * The A.S/E. recently left the Engineering  and Shipbuilding Trades Federation.  .Negotiations havetaken place regarding its return, but so far they have come to  nothing.
     A further  meeting  was  held,  on 24th  December and another memorandum was issued signed by the same officials as those mentioned above.  This memorandum was mainly intended to provide for the changes of organisation which must necessarily follow a reduction of  working hours.  In it, arrangements are sanctioned whereby the time at which the day shift shall terminate shall be agreed upon between the firms and their men. Permission is also given to work an extra half hour on one evening of the week in order to make up the 47 hours.  The contrast to which attention has already been drawn between the position of  the time worker and that of the piece worker is brought out explicitly in two of the provisions contained in this document:    .     (a) Time rate per hour to be increased for day shift men according to the amount of           reduction in  hours.     (b) No change shall be made in piece work prices  or rates.     It was hardly to be expected that this contrast would not  lead to difficulties in some areas, and a review of the disputes that have taken place since the 1st January, the date when it was to become operative, shows that one of the main difficulties, at any rate in the shipbuilding trade, centres around the position of the piece workers.  It has already been pointed out that the original claim of the unions was for a 44-hour week on the one break system, and refusal to accept anything less constitutes a second cause of dispute. Another difficulty which has arisen is  that relating to the arrangement of hours.  Under the new arrangement the men have to get their breakfast before going to work, and this gives rise to  two complaints, first, that, - especially where any travelling has to be done, this renders  the interval  till the next  meal unreasonably  long; and  secondly, that it disturbs the family,at an unnecessarily early hour.  Finally there is the inevitable question raised by  all  such developments, that of demarcation.   A number of disputes have been caused by claims to come under the terms of the arrangement, to which employers objected. As is natural, such disputes have shown a tendency to occur on premises where certain of the men came by undisputed right under its terms.   In general, current disputes would seem to turn on one  or other of these considerations.   The most notable example of a demarcation dispute  was the strike on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company&apos;s works at Formby.  On the Clyde, strong objection has been taken to the one break arrangement, and the masters in these  cases have conceded extra time for breakfast.   The same remarks would seem to  apply to the disputes at Falkirk, where work has been resumed pending negotiations.  At Bradford 2,000 men struck work owing to the withdrawal of quarter hour&apos;s grace in the morning consequent upon the  introduction of a 47-hour week, and at Hartlepool four shipyards  are idle through  employers&apos;  insistence  upon  stricter  time keeping.   The workers on the Wear and in the Belfast yards are resolute in their demands for the 44-hour  week  originally asked for, whereas the Tyne  shipyard workers are divided between a 44-hour Aveek and an alternative in the shape of a daily half hour for breakfast to be included in the 47-hour week.  At Hull, Beverley and Hessle the piece workers struck because of a weekly reduction of 12s.  in their wages consequent upon adopting the new arrangements, and. other workers struck in sympathy.    At the week-end, the position was as follows : On Saturday a conference of represen- tatiyes of  boilermakers,  shipwrights and blacksmiths at Newcastle adopted a resolution advising the resumption of work provided that  the employers  agree that piece and lieu* workers suffer no reduction in wages.   The resolution also pressed for two breaks a day on the 47-hour week, and for opening local negotiations for a 44-hour week.  This resolution had been adopted by strikers at Jarrow, and was being placed before other mass  meetings. Work Avill not be resumed, however, until employers and  men&apos;s delegates meet.  Elsewhere on the Tyne there had been no resumption of work, but the situation Avas regarded as being a little easier.  Shipyard workers generally on the Tees were still on strike.  Under  an award of the Court of Arbitration regarding electricity undertakings in the London district, the 47-hour Aveek is to be worked in the case of  day workers, and a 48-hour week in the case  of shift Avorkers,  subject to certain conditions, to Come into force on 1st February. Electricians at the Chelsea Power Station have been conceded the 47-hour week.   Shiftmen are to have a 48-hour week.   In each  case adjustments in wages have been made.  The dispute at  the  Formby  Power Station, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway,  has been pratically settled, shiftmen being given a 47-hour instead of 55-hour Aveek.   Overtimepay still remains to be settled.    Thus the situation, Avhile still sufficiently acute, may be  regarded  as somewhat easierand more hopeful than it was.  Later  developments are reported in Parts III and IV ofthe Report.                  * Time workers whose earnings are augmented on a price basis.

                            PART II.-PRESS  COMMENTS.                            (1) Labour  and Socialist Press.                               [A).-Peace Conference.     The Labour papers generally are very despondent as  to the outcome of the PeaceConference.  The fear is expressed that the main object of  the Allied plenipotentiaries isto put down Bolshevism in  all  lands.  Bolshevism, according to the &quot; Workers&apos;  Dread-nought &quot; has now become the name for Socialism of the immediate sort.   In  the opinionof the &quot; Call,&quot; the&apos; Peace Conference aims  at the prolongation of the  precarious life ofCapitalism ; the conquerors  are out to redistribute power so as more effectually to resist the social revolution.President  Wilson.     In the &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot;it is feared that M. Clemenceau looks upon the President asapoliticalDon Quixote.  The &quot; Call &quot; cannot understand the confidence&apos;that the Presidentinspires in some quarters. He failed in consenting to the intervention in  Russia in defiance of the principles he had  enunciated.   He fails in participating in the secret diplomacy hedenounced. &quot; Forward,&quot; on the other hand, definitely stands by the President,  and GeorgeLansbury in the  &quot; Herald &quot; suggests that, as the Labour Party are pledged to PresidentWilson&apos;s policy, they should  go to the Prime Minister and compel him to answer whether he intends to support the same principles or not.  If the Prime Minister does not givea satisfactory answer, it is the plain duty of all those who claim to lead Labour  to proclaimtheir determination  to organise a general strike in all countries on behalf of the peacepolicy which alone will save  the world.        .Balance of Power.     Strong fears are expressed that the League  of Nations is rapidly passing into a HolyAlliance.   The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; points out that the determination of the Allied Govern-ments to maintain the balance of power policy is  a violation of all the public pledges Alliedstatesmen  have made to justify  the continuation of  the  war.  Mr.  Brailsford  in- the&quot; Herald &quot; adopts the pessimistic view that  the  League of Nations itself may  conceal, asthe real active nucleus of the new world organisation, such  an alliance as M. Clemenceaudesires.International Labour Conference at  Lausanne.     Those papers Avhich mention the Conference have little hope of its usefulness.  The&quot; Call&quot; thinks that the Conference should be handling wider problems than those of Labourlegislation, as Mr. Henderson proposes,  especially at  a  time when the world is  beingredivided  in the &quot; thieves&apos;  kitchen &quot; at Versailles.  &quot; Justice &quot; thinks that it will beunsuccessful because its delegations, being restricted, the Conference will be subjected to criticism from  socialist sections in almost all countries because of its unrepresentativecharacter.                               (B.) Foreign Affairs.Russia.    The &quot;Call,&quot; the  &quot;Herald,&quot; the&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader &quot;continue the agitation against our intervention in Russia.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; is sure that the reason for our invasion is a financial one.  The &quot; Herald &quot; puts down the delay in demobilisation to  the  Governments fear of the Red Flag in Russia.   &quot;  The Allies aretrembling  for more than  their Russian dividends ;  they are trembling for the  security ofthe dividend-hunting system,  all the world over.&quot;    Mr. Hyndman in &quot; Justice,&quot; while accepting  as true the view that Lenin and Trotskyare paid agents of Germany,  condemns the Allied invasion, since it is not in the interestsof the true revolutionaries the noble-minded idealists but in the interests of the readiness-tionaries and at the instigation of Russian financiers.                                (C). Home Affairs.The Great Mutiny.    The &quot; Herald &quot; describes the demonstrations of soldiers at Folkestone and elsewhereas &quot;the great mutiny,&quot;  which ended  with supreme victory for the mutineers.   The&quot; Labour Leader &quot; draws  the conclusion that militarism, just in the hour of its greatest
inflation, is developing the seeds of its own destruction.  W. F. Watson in the &quot;Workers&apos;Dreadnought,&quot; seems to think that the soldiers are forming councils,, and he hopes thatthese will link up with the Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committee movement.Ireland.    Several papers refer to Ireland as  being kept in forcible subjection by the british army while the constitutional verdict is overwhelmingly in favour of separation from theBritish Government.  The &quot; Herald &quot; adds  that  this  is happening while  &quot; the sons of britain have given their lives  to ensure the freedom of Czechs, Serbs, and Belgians.&quot;Nationalisation.    According to the &quot; Herald &quot; the  nationalisation of the railways is imminent.  Thereare two dangers to be avoided : first, the danger of paying too much ;  secondly, the dangerof reducing the status and freedom of the railway workers.  It must be seen to  that themeasure promised by Mr. Winston Churchill shall include clauses which will secure to theworkers concerned the control of their own working lives.              (2) The Daily Press on Demobilisation  and Resettlement.                        (A). Discharge of  Munition Workers.Numbers  Unemployed.    The  &quot; Daily Express &quot; (8th January) estimates that the  rate of unemployment hasincreased to 82  per  10,000 of the population.  The &quot;Liverpool Post&quot; (7th  January)states that  only  a few hundred women have found employment while 6,000 are  drawingthe donation at  Liverpool.  According to the  &quot; Manchester  Guardian &quot; (8th  January)the unemployment figures for the Manchester area are 10,000 women  and 7,000 men.The  closing of the aircraft works at Aintree and Hollinwood  (Gorse Mill) are partly re-sponsible for these figures; while the cotton trade, which should ultimately absorb mostof the local labour, is reported to be temporarily suffering from shortage of material.Employment Prospects.    According to the &quot; Sheffield Telegraph &quot; (8th  January) there is a London  tea-shopfirm which is prepared to take back 4,000 girls who left to do munition work.                         (B). Demobilisation of the Army.Demonstrations.     Several of the papers comment on the recent demonstrations of soldiers at Folkestoneand elsewhere.   The &quot; Manchester Guardian&quot; (8th  January) regards it  as disastrousthat such proceedings should  become normal.  The &quot; Birmingham  Post&quot; (7th January)condemns the levity with Which agitation on the subject  of demobilisation delays hasbeen fomented by &quot; some sensational journals.&quot;  The  &quot; Leicester Post&quot; (9th January)blames the &quot;Stunt Press&quot; and the  &quot;Times&quot; (8th January) refuses  to publish  letterswhich tend to fan an agitation &quot; which is already mischievous and may beconie dangerous.&quot;Various other reasons for  the unrest have been advanced.  The &quot;Dundee Advertiser&quot;(8th January) attributes most of the trouble to the General Election.  The &quot; YorkshirePost&quot; (9th January) considers that the impatience of the soldiers is due among other things-to  the fear that all good jobs will be secured  by ex-munition workers and thesoldiers first demobilised,  and that the employment exchanges are &quot; thrust in  between a man and his job, in cases where there is no difficulty in employee or employer gettingtogether.&quot;  The  &quot; Pall Mall Gazette  &quot; (8th  January) suggests regular consultation withcompetent representatives of the &quot; citizen soldiers &quot; as a solution of the problem. Machinery  of Demobilisation.     Simpler machinery for obtaining urgently-needed men is demanded by  employers at Liverpool and Sheffield (&quot; Liverpool Post &quot; and &quot; Sheffield Independent,&quot; 7th January).                           PART III.-DISTRICT REPORTS.London and South-Eastern.    There is little to report from this district.  It is stated that 1,900 workpeople wereto be dismissed from the National Aircraft Factory, Waddon, on 11th January.    The London bakers are demanding the total abolition of night-work.
 West Midlands.    In Coventry it is reported that the engineers are discussing a plan involving a further reduction of hours which consists in ceasing work after 44 hours ; and if this fails to meetthe unemployment problem, they propose only to work 40 hours. Yorkshire and East Midlands.    A serious situation is reported to have  arisen among the Yorkshire miners, owingmainly to the fact that many returned soldiers have been refused work at the collierieswhere they were employed before enlisting.North-Western.    In the Manchester district  there is considerable  discontent in connection with  the47-hour week, especially among piece workers.    Several isolated  strikes have occurred in this district during the week.  It is reportedthat the Aintree National Factory employees are dissatisfied because they did not receivethe two days&apos; pay during the Christmas holidays, which they allege was  paid at other national Factories.Northern.    It is reported that the Jarrow and Mid-Tyne engineers have decided to  remain atwork under the  new conditions  for three months, and then to demand a 44-hour week.The reasons put  forward by the late strikers in favour  of a 44-hour week include the fear that rapid demobilisation will cause great unemployment.  There  is also a  feeling  amongthe men  that if  they do not take the opportunity of  securing reduced hours  now, theymay not have another chance.  -South Wales.    Several strikes have occurred among the miners during the week.    Hopes are expressed that all men who, prior to the war, had no connection with the mines, will be discharged immediately in order to make room for demobilised bona fideminers.Scotland.    The  47-hour week continues to be the cause of unrest; for the time being, however.the majority  of the men have returned to work.                               PART IV. DISPUTES.  ,    The industrial situation generally has become  somewhat more disturbed during theweek;  the 47-hour week continues to be the chief cause of unrest.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The Coal Controller reports eighteen fresh stoppages for the week ending 14th January,in two cases work has already been resumed.  A number of collieries  are idle in SouthYorkshire in connection with the demand made by the surface workers that the windingof coal should cease for 20 minutes each day at 10  a.m. for a&apos;meal time.  Collieries havebeen rendered idle in Durham owing to the strike of cokemen and by-product workers,and in Lanarkshire owing to  a  strike resulting from the eviction of an under-manager.In both cases, however,  it is  unofficially reported that work has  already been resumed.In connection with the dispute regarding the substitution of shovels for forks in Leicester-shire, the  miners&apos; representatives have been induced to recommend a resumption of work under the terms of the agreement arrived at between the Derbyshire employers and minerson 21st October, 1918.    The War Office Contracts Department has nothing to report.Reported from Other Sources.           It was reported on the 13th that the Jarrow and Mid-Tyrie engineers have decided to return       to work under the new  conditions  (see in  this  connection, also Part III).  The joiners at       Hebburn and Jarrow have  also decided to  resume work.  The Hull boilermakers and  ship-       wrights decided at a mass meeting on Sunday, 12th January, to continue the strike pending       the decision of the Conference at Newcastle on  15th January.   They are calling out  their       apprentices, and other sections of workers will be affected.
           All the employees  at the Chislet Colliery (Kent)  struck on 8th January, the principal       grievance being that the employers keep one week&apos;s wages in hand instead of three days&apos; as       hitherto.           A strike occurred at the Kirkless Coke Ovens,  Ince, on 7th January.  The men were       granted the 49-hour week which they demanded originally, but they are now making a further       demand for a 48-hour week to include meal times.           The London barbers&apos; dispute is still unsettled.(b) Not Involving  a Stoppage of Work.    The Coal Controller has no cases to report.                             ,  .Reported from Other Sources.           Strikes are threatened in several factories in South Staffordshire because the workers       object to the shorter  working week  on the ground that, as at present operated, it makes       them work  to a late hour in the evening.           On 13th January the Welsh anthracite miners decided to suspend the notices to strike        to take effect on 14th January which had  been  given  throughout the  Welsh  anthracite       coal-field.    The Court of Arbitration heard 14 cases in London and 6 in Glasgow during the past week.  These included an application by the electrical workers employed in London forthe extension of the Award of the Committee on Production which granted an advanceof 5s. per week from December, 1918, to  workers in the engineering and foundry trades.
