The question of a shorter working week is being discussed in many of the districts,.but there is little evidence of imminent disturbance.Part 1V : Disputes.    (a)  Involving  a Stoppage of Work The most  serious strike  reported this week hastaken place at the Naval shipyard of Messrs. Armstrong Whitworth&apos;s, at Walker-on-Tyne,whereabout 500 riveters and 300 caulkers are  on strike,  and other grades of workers areexpected to follow in sympathy.    (b)  Not Involving a  Stoppage of Work. There are no important  cases reported thisweek.                           I.-GENERAL  REMARKS.Reduction of Working Hours.    Among the many industrial problems which, with the advent of peace conditions, are becoming acute and pressing, one of the most important and fundamental is the question ofworking hours.  This matter was referred to briefly in the last Report in connection withthe forthcoming ballot of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation on the offer of a 47-hour week by the employers.  The results of the ballot are now available.  Theoffer has been accepted by 285,558 votes to 147,086.  In view of the fact that the questionof hours is so  closely bound up with that of other working conditions, the other pointsreported to be covered by the agreement are of interest.  These include the maintenancefor the present of other working conditions unaltered, except that the new  week is to beon the one-break system ; the application of the present weekly time rates to the reducedworking week ; the early consideration of the economic conditions and systems and bases.of remuneration;   and the immediate arrangement of provisions for avoiding disputes.    This particular case, however,, though undoubtedly of importance,  is only the latestdevelopment in a movement which is spreading rapidly.  Even in this case a considerableminority voted in favour of insisting on a 44-hour week.  Similarly the concession of a48-hour week  to the railwaymen  has not stopped the movement for a 44-hour week.The unions in  the woollen industry have just put in a claim  for  a 45-hour week; the   (C 1605) 120  1/19 H&amp;S             \
 National Transport Workers&apos;  Federation has demanded a 44-hour  week  for  tramway workers;  the  South  Wales  miners  have asked the Miners&apos; Federation  of  Great Britain to press for a six-hour clay.  The Iron and Steel Trades  Confederation is negotiations- ating for an eight-hour day, and the J.I.C. for the silk  trade lias agreed on a 49-hour week instead of 55.  These are only a few instances of a very widespread and important movement.      Concurrently the demand is being put forward for a universal statutory eight-hour day, a demand which has been endorsed by the Adult Education  Committee  in their first Interim Report.  The  question arises  whether the concession of the latter demand by legislation would not relieve  the  strain in  industrial  relations  imposed by the former demands.   The arguments in  favour of a general  measure are strong.  It  would secure the  advantages of shorter hours  for ill-organised industries, in which the workpeople are unable to secure them for themselves.   It would tend to equalise conditions for the industrial  population as a whole,  and it would afford an impressive  opening to  a policy of industrial reconstruction.   Such a measure would need to be carefully drafted in order to ensure that its effect would really be an increase of leisure and not merely an increase of overtime pay, but provision would be necessary for allowing, under licence or in some other way, longer hours in those industries in which production could not otherwise be maintained.      It does not appear, however, that a general  measure would necessarily check the demands now being pressed in individual industries, as is shown by the demands of sections of the railwaymen and miners, who either  enjoy or are  promised the eight-hour day. The  motives  behind the demand for shorter  hours fall in the main under three heads:  (1) leisure ;  (2) the  re-absorption in normal employment  of soldiers and war-workers; (3) wages.  There  is a  general desire  for more free time  than existing working  hours leave, especially when the time taken in going to and from work, and changing to and from working clothes is taken into account.  The argument is also common that a shorter week would provide openings for returning workers, and is necessary to prevent unemployment and conflict between the two classes of workers.  There is no doubt also that some of the workers look  to a reduction of  nominal hours, with a corresponding increase in work rated as overtime, as a means of increasing wages.      No general measure, however, wTould secure the attainment  of these objects for all workers, since they are all objects  which require special measures adapted to the varying conditions of  different industries.      Thus  the value of leisure is relative to work.   Heavy and continuous physical  work, such, as work  at a puddling furnace, leaves a man in no condition to make an educational use of his leisure, unless the ratio of working hours to leisure is comparatively small.  The time spent in getting to and from work should also be taken into consideration.  Light routine work, which does not produce physical exhaustion, can be carried on for a longer period without destroying the value of the subsequent period of leisure. Ideally, therefore, hours should  be considered in  relation to the nature and conditions of work, and varied accordingly.     Similarly it is to be noted that the  possibility  of absorbing more labour by  reducing hours varies  from industry to industry.  In  certain  &quot; key &quot; or &quot; pivotal &quot; industries there is already a serious shortage of labour, and the re-absorption  of labour by  other industries dependent on them would be delayed and hampered by any  reduction of output from them.  Again, the capacity  of certain industries to  employ labour is  dependent entirely on the machines and other plant available ; a reduction  of hours, therefore, will afford no additional employment, unless it can be accompanied by an increase in plant- a matter requiring time or an increase in the number of shifts worked.  From the point of view of employment therefore every industry requires separate consideration.   Further,if shorter hours lead as is alleged to higher production, the absorption of additional labour is governed by the demand actual or stimulated by supply of the product.    So far as  the demand for shorter industrial hours is a veiled demand for higher wages as already pointed out, this  can only be a matter for collective  bargaining industry by industry.   Commercial conditions  and prospects, which vary from industry to industry,are essential factors in the settlement of wages.  In this connection attention should alsobe  paid to the  difference between industries in the possibilities  they offer of reducinghours without reducing output or  increasing  labour cost. Great  differences exist in thisrespect, which are important, since the scientific demonstration that shorter hours in any industry are as economical or mere economical than existing hours, will remove the chiefopposition  to reduction.  The enquiries of the Research  Board, appointed recently by theDepartment of Scientific and Industrial  Research, and  the Medical Research Committeeinto the relations of hours and other industrial conditions  to output may, therefore, beexpected possibly to point the  way to many immediately practicable reforms.
                                II.-PRESS  COMMENTS.                          1. THE LABOUR  AND SOCIALIST PRESS.                                       (A)  Military.   The Peace  Terms.        It is generally assumed that the  European Allies are at issue with President Wilson   in respect of peace  terms.  According to the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (2.1st December), President   Wilson&apos;s fourteen  points have been torn up for electioneering purposes and proposals of   an ignorant,  vindictive and impossible character have been substituted for them.  The   &quot; Call &quot;  (21st December) declares that the  Allies generally  are endeavouring to  escape   from President  Wilson&apos;s terms, and  as  a natural  result the American navy is  being   increased.  Mr. Brailsford in the &quot; Herald &quot; (21st December) alleges that we  have  &quot; lost   the peace &quot; and that a new militarism has arisen.  With our demand for a supreme navy   and other  nations&apos; consequent refusal to  abandon  conscription, a new struggle for  the   balance of  power will ensue, Germany uniting with Russia on one side and the Americans   rivalling our navy  on the other.   President Wilson.        The &quot;  Herald  &quot; (21st December) writes encouraging President Wilson to maintain his   position, although he  stands alone against the sinister  influences that are working to destroy   the chance of a clean and sane peace.   If the President stands firm, Labour will be solid   behind him.  Mr.  Ramsay Macdonalcl, on the other hand, writes in &quot; Forward &quot;  (28th   December) somewhat depreciatingly of President Wilson.   He  regrets that Labour,  not   being in a position mentally or numerically to trust itself, must hand over the task ofl   framing  the European settlement to  the  President, a man  who by his acts has shown   himself to be an autocrat rather than a democrat.  As yet, he is  still trusted by European   democrats, but his Weakness is at home where he no longer holds a commanding position,   owing to his autocratic method of entering and carrying on the war.   In the &quot; Workers&apos;   Dreadnought&quot; (21st December) there also appears an article by Miss Sylvia  Pankhurst,   entitled &quot; The Wilson Stunt,&quot; in which she criticises the action of the Socialists in their   adulation of  the President.                                   (B) Foreign Affairs.   Intervention in Russia.        All the papers continue  the campaign  against  intervention in Russia.   &quot; Justice &quot;   (21st December) by no means a pro-Bolshevik paper, asks for replies to three questions :   (1) Are Allied Forces in Russia in accordance with the express desire of any large section   of the people ? (2) If so, with whom are they acting ?  (3) If not, with what objects are they   operating there ?   In its issue of 28th December &quot; Justice &quot; criticises Lord Milner&apos;s reasons   for our intervention in  Russia and repeats  its questions of the previous week.        The &quot; Herald  &quot;  (28th December) publishes a severe criticism of the  Governments   explanations  of the Russian war.  The Government does not  say, because it dare not   say, the real reasons for our invasion of Russia.  It  is, therefore, reduced to shifting from       (C 1605)                                                                 A 2    The soundest method of procedure is undoubtedly for the Government to lend every encouragement to the responsible bodies in the various industries to take up the questionof hours and to deal with it themselves.   Both the Home Office and the Ministry oi Labourhave been proceeding along these lines, and it is probable that most of the Joint industrial councils, and many of the Trade Boards, who now have statutory power to fix a normalweek in relation to wages, will in the near future agree upon considerable reductions.  Onthe other hand, this may not altogether prevent the labour movement from pressing theGovernment to guarantee a maximum working week in all industries.  Where the machinery and organisation for collective bargaining does not exist there is no power to make a reduc-tion of hours universally eifective, though this difficulty it is hoped to remedy to a very largeextent by the establishment of Trade Boards in the unorganised trades in the near future.It is also to be remembered that a similar movement for the reduction of hours is takingplace  on the Continent, particularly in Germany, and there may be a strong demand atthe International  Labour Conference, which is to meet at Lausanne, for  an  international agreement as to a 48-hour working week as proposed by the American Delegation.  Thequestion of a statutory 48-hour week is, therefore, one which requires careful consideration.
one excuse to another.  These excuses include the following: That the Bolsheviks are paid secret agents of the  Kaiser because they handed over the Black Sea Fleet to theGermans, but  that  was because they were  forced to make a  humiliating peace ; theGermans handed over their fleet to the British for the same reason.   That it is our duty to put down the vile regime which has let loose anarchy, famine and murder in Russia ; but these are not the product of Bolshevism hut the legacy of the old regime and of a disastrouswar.  Nor will the armed invasion of Russia  serve to remove them.  If Russia is left toherself she will find herself.   No &quot;tyrannous minority,&quot; no &quot; handful of assassins&quot; can maintain  a regime of terror.  Either the Bolsheviks will prevail and an orderly Sovietsystem be established, or they will be thrown over by the Russian masses.Bolshevik Government.    The &quot; Call &quot; (21st December) quotes a letter from an Englishman just returned fromRussia, who describes the state of the country as orderly and regular.  He states that a remarkable effect has been produced among the Intelligentsia by the appointment of MaximGorky to a post under the Government.  The  &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; (28th December),in a special Russian number, gives a history of the Soviets (reprinted from the &quot; Liberator &quot;)reproduces a number of Soviet decrees,  and gives an account  of education under the soviets.   The capitalist cry that there is no government in Russia is a lie ; &quot; throughoutall the cities and towns of Russia  there exists to-day a highly complex political structurewhich is upheld by the vast majority  of the people and which is functioning as well as anynewborn popular government ever functioned.&quot;                                 (C) Home  Affairs.The General Election.    The papers generally clearly anticipate  an overwhelming Coalition  victory.   The&quot; Labour Leader &quot; (21st December), however, anticipates that Mr. Lloyd George will onlyobtain a  temporary victory.  Revulsion of feeling against the Coalition,  which  beganduring the last week of the election, will continue to grow in force until these &quot; unprincipledpolitical adventurers &quot; are driven from power.  The reason for the anticipated failure ofmany Labour candidates is alleged to have been due to the unscrupulous Press attack onsuch candidates, and especially on the I.L.P. leaders, during the last three days. &quot; Justice &quot;(21st  December) anticipating that only  a  quarter  of the  Coalition candidates will beLiberals, asks who is going to  support Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s program of social progress ?The Unionists will not do so and, therefore, since Mr. Lloyd George will be unable to  carryon, another election may be expected in 1920.           (2) THE DAILY PRESS ON DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.                       (A). Discharges of Munition Workers.    Somewhat fewer references to the discharge of munition workers appeared in the papers during the Christmas week.  The &quot; Evening News &quot;  (19th December) reports thatdischarges at Woolwich Arsenal have been suspended for three  weeks in order to give theworkers time to look for other employment.  According to the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; (20thDecember), the chief difficulty here appears io be &quot; the magnetic attraction of the  townto those who are not normally residents there.&quot;    It is  estimated in the &quot; Evening News&quot;  (20th December)  that over 4,000 munition workers have already been discharged in the Tottenham and Edmonton districts.   Withina month 2,000 women will be discharged from the Small  Arms Factory, Enfield.  It isstated in the &quot; Weekly Dispatch &quot; (22nd December) that 30,000 munition workers employed at Vickers&apos;,  Barrow, have been given holidays until 6th January, to enable the firm toprepare for peace industry.  The only appearance of unrest among discharged munition workers  is reported from  Birmingham by  the  &quot; Birmingham Post &quot; (19th December).Here  considerable unrest is alleged to have been caused by the  action of fifty firms indismissing skilled men while dilutees were retained.Openings for ex-Munition Workers.    According to the &quot; Liverpool Post &quot; (18th December) the toy-making industry  offersexcellent  openings for employment: &quot; the entire army of women ex-munition workerscould be absorbed into this industry in time,  and less training is necessary than for  shell-making.&quot;
    The  &quot; Standard &quot;  (24th December) reports  that  at  Crayford, Messrs. Vickers havealready begun manufacturing sewing machines.  The &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot; (18th Decem-ber) contains an article condemning the Government for allowing the employment of largenumbers  of people on munition work to continue, at a time when  the railways, and thebuilding and  other trades are being held up for want of labour.Training.    The need for training ex-munition girls in dress-making has been recognised in variouscentres.  For instance, the &quot; Yorkshire Post&quot; .(l9th December) states that the wholesaleclothiers in Leeds have a scheme ready for the training of ex-munition girls as machinists ;and it is reported in the &quot; Times &quot;(19th December) that the London Employers&apos; association is co-operating with the Ministry of Labour to provide training facilities for girls entering the thousands of openings provided by West End dressmaking firms.                          (B). Demobilisation of the  Army.Governmental Machinery and Delay.    The  &quot; Daily Express&quot; (30th  December) in a leading article, urges Sir Eric Geddes to speed up demobilisation, and prophesies that if this is not done there whTbe &quot; great dis-satisfaction.&quot;  On the  other hand, in some papers the delay is considered inevitable, andin others is even encouraged.   Major-General Sir F. Maurice writes to the &quot; Daily News &quot;(24th December) that &quot; with broken communications the process  of sorting out men fromthe armies by trades, collecting them, and sending them home is necessarily a slow business.&quot;The &quot; Observer &quot; (22nd December) suggests that the process of demobilisation should be slow until the  peace  terms are settled.   According to the &quot;World&quot;  (28th December)the cause of the delay in reinstating ex-soldiers and munition workers in peace-time employ-ment, &quot; is the absurdly arbitrary restrictions which are being placed by the Governmenton the supply and purchase of materials.&quot;    With regard to the demobilisation of &quot; slip men,&quot; the &quot; Daily Express &quot; (18th December)says that the promises  for their early release, have as yet, come to nothing, in spite of the simple method by which they can be discharged.Pivotal Men.    The  &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; (23rd December) suggests that one  of the principal obstruc-tions to the demobilisation of pivotal  men is the opposition of the Commanding officers to the withdrawal of  their men.  Meanwhile the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;  (24th December)reports that  &quot; miners  are being discharged in such numbers  that  difficulties are being experienced in South Wales in absorbing them into the industry.&quot;   In the &quot; Daily Tele-graph&quot; (24th December), the  secretary of the  Chemical Trade Industrial  Council, Mr.Lloyd  Roberts, points out that,  as the  chemical industry is not  considered a pivotalindustry, chemical process men will not obtain early release and  many dependent trades,will surfer in consequence.  Rather curiously, he cites steelwork S  IS EL H example,  andtherefore appeals for the treatment of limestone quarrymen on the same lines  as miners.Soldiers on the Land.    The &quot; Sheffield Daily Telegraph &quot; (21st December), announces that thousands of menare leaving the colours daily to return to the land.  The &quot; Evening News&quot; (19th December),on  the other hand, reports that in East Suffolk  the farmers are  petitioning the Ministryof Labour to release men as quickly as possible for the land.   The British County HomesteadAssociation is said to be giving considerable practical assistance in  settling ex-soldiers onthe land, &quot;Morning Post&quot; (19th December).   They aim  at providing  central trainingfarms and homesteads where men may be trained on &quot; a co-operative  or other basis,&quot;for different forms of agriculture.Disabled Men.    The difficulties in connection with the employment of disabled soldiers are widelyrealised,  and some suggestions are made as to how these  difficulties should be met.  The&quot;Daily Express&quot; (19th December) thinks that a &quot;large  and permanent machinery of hospitals and institutions will be needed by the Ministry of Pensions for the partly disabledmen who are now in the War Office hospitals,&quot;  and asks what steps are being taken inthis direction.  The &quot; Observer&quot; (22nd December)  reports that  the  London central advisory Committee has recommended that the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofPensions should confer  together with a view to establishing national workshops for disabledmen throughout the country.
    The &quot; Yorkshire Post&quot; (19th  December) says that the Leeds Education Committeehas decided to establish a technical training centre for discharged men ;  and the erection of training workshops will begin immediately.Training of Discharged  Men.    The &quot; Morning Post&quot; (21st December) reports that a scheme for training 75 dischargedmen in  clock and watch repairing,  will be put into operation by the British HorologicalInstitute.                            III. -DISTRICT  REPORTS. London and South Eastern.     Conditions remained fairly quiet during the Christmas week.     It is reported that there is a movement on foot among the workers in the West London area to force the Government to pay a higher rate of unemployment donation.  It is even suggested that a demand should be made that out-of-work pay should equal what is earned at work, on the ground that this would compel the Government to find employment for all. West Midlands.     It is reported from Coventry that strong dissatisfaction is being felt by the engineers at the wholesale dismissals taking place at the  Coventry Ordnance Works.  It is alleged that these works could easily be adapted to peace-time requirements if the firm would only make some effort to frame a reconstruction scheme.     No other reports of unrest have been received from this district. Yorkshire and East Midlands.     The dispute in the plain net  section of the  Nottingham Lace Trade has been settled, and the threatened strike averted.   The industrial situation in the  Leeds  district is said to be comparatively quiet.  The  engineers continue to be fully employed,  and there is a prospect of steady employment during the  coming year.     Efforts are being made to obtain a  48-hour week  for all  members of the Machine Woolcombers&apos; Trade Union, both for day and night workers. North Western.    Comparatively little unrest is reported from this district.  Trouble is reported among electricians at Liverpool owing to the arrest of one of their men as an army absentee. As he belonged to a protected trade, the man refused to perform military duties and was imprisoned. The E.T.U. threaten to strike unless he is released, and the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation has promised its support.    At  a meeting of the Mersey Engineering and  Shipbuilding  Federation  on  17th December, the future of the National Factory at Aintree was discussed, and it was decided to point out to the Ministry of Munitions that  a factory so well equipped should not be used as a warehouse, but should continue to be run as a national producing factory.  J. L. Smyth and W. M. Citrine  were elected to  attend the National Conference of Engineering and Shipbuilding Federations  and District Committees held at Manchester on 20th and 21st December.  They were recommended by  the  meeting to  support a demand for a 35-hour working week.    A new form  of revolutionary propaganda appears to have been started at Barrow, the &quot; Workers&apos; Freedom Groups &quot; have circulated a pamphlet giving the basis on which these groups are to be formed.   Revolution is  advocated as being, the only method by which poverty and the capitalist class can be abolished.  The alleged object in this case is not &quot; to obtain  suitable control,&quot; but to abolish control.    This emancipation  is to come through the workers&apos; organisations.   &quot; The workers by their own efforts must recon- struct industry to  supply their own needs, and  politicians and officials will have no part in it.&quot; Northern.    A strike is in progress at the naval shipyard of Messrs. Armstrong  Whitworth, Newcastle.    With  the exception of this strike and some unrest among a certain  section of theNorthumberland miners, this district appears to be quiet.
\                                  IV.-DISPUTES.    The industrial situation generally appears to be somewhat unsettled.   Unrest is beingengendered by various causes and on various grounds.   The demand for a shorter Avorkingweek appears to be the most universal, though many actual disputes have not so far arisenon this score.    (Reports from the Ministry of Munitions  and the  Admiralty Labour Department  havebeen discontinued.)(a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The War  Office Contracts Department has nothing to report.    Tlie Coal Controller reports eight fresh stoppages for the week ending 31st December ;in six cases work has already been resumed.Reported from Other  Sources.           The most serious strike reported this week has taken place at the naval shipyard of Messrs.       Armstrong Whitworth, Walker-on-Tyne.  About 500 riveters and 300 caulkers ceased  work       on 24th December, because the firm refused to pay the same rate of wages on naval work as       on merchant work, where the pneumatic tool is used.  The Committee on Production had advises       employers to pay the same rate for both kinds of work, but suggested that the matter should be       settled  locally.  With  the exception  of Messis.  Armstrong&apos;?, all the firms on the Tyne  have       followed the advice of the Committee on Production.  It is feared that if the matter is not       adjusted speedily, the  whole of the boilermakers on the Tyne may strike in sympathy ;   and       the drillers, shipwrights and blacksmiths  may also cease work.  According to a later report,       the platers and platers&apos; helpers are already out in sympathy.           The strike reported last week  at Messrs. A. V. Roe&apos;s, Manchester, is still in progress.  It       appears that the firm offered to take the discharged shop stewards back at the district  rate,       which is 5*. less than the  wage&apos; they are accustomed to pay.  The strikers say that the firm       discharged the men knowing that a strike would follow, in the hope that when it was settled       they could get the men back at this lower rate.  The men are refusing to return on these terms.    The members of the A.S.E. have accepted the employers&apos; offer of a 47-hour week bya large majority.  This event has come as a great surprise to the Tyneside workers,  who,as was previously reported,  were overwhelmingly in favour of  a 44-hour week.South Wales.    Work has been resumed at all the collieries where strikes have recently been in progress,and the general situation in this district appears to be tranquil.Scotland.    The question of a shorter  working week is  receiving considerable attention  amongvarious groups of workers.    The Lanarkshire andFifeshire Miners are putting forward a  demand for a six-hour dayof five days a week.  It is reported that they approached the Clyde Workers&apos; Committeeand urged its members to support their demand.   This body, however,  decided by  a large majority that it could not at present join in  any agitation for  shorter hours.    The majority of the employees at Messrs. John  Brown, Clyde Bank, have decide i infavour of a  47-hour week.    With regard to the recent ballot of the A.S.E. on a 47-hour week, it is reported that,although the Clyde  and other large engineering  centres voted  against the proposal, the glasgow workers have made up their minds to fall in with the decision of the majority.Not so  the  engineers employed at Yarrow&apos;s, Whiteinch,  who  have passed  a resolutionstrongly protesting against the precipitate ballot vote and asking all Clyde workers to vote in favour of a 44-hour week as a basis for further negotiation.    It is reported that a certain amount of discontent exists on the Clyde owing to the alleged rush of young Irishmen to the Greenock and Port Glasgow shipyards, where theyare filling the places of men awaiting demobilisation.  The reason for this anxiety, however,is  said to be unfounded, as the small number of  Irish who are  arriving are employed on purely unskilled work, and they are likely to be turned off at any time in favour of returningsoldiers.
            About 200 men employed at Messrs. Laws and Company, Barking, struck on 30th December,        owing to the non-payment of war bonus during the Christmas holidays.  This firm is under        Government control.  On the same date, 150 woodworkers employed by Messrs. John Gorlick,        aeroplane manufacturers, Chelsea, ceased work because a non-union foreman had been put in        charge of one of the branches.
