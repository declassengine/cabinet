G. H. Roberts, M.P., lias succeeded the Right Hon. J. R. clynes,M.P., as Food Controller.    In a statement issued to tho Press  on  the subject of this  country&apos;s part in therevictualment of Europe, the new Food  Controller pointed out that the continuance ofcontrol  here was governed by  the needs  of  Europe as a whole.  Victory  had its obligations and we were not going to shirk them.  Great tracts of the Continent were on the  verge of  starvation and  the problem could  only be grappled  with by inter-allied action.  The Supreme Inter-Allied Council of Supply and Relief had been setup to meet the situation and he was going at once to Paris to confer with the british representatives.    The  third meeting  of the Supreme Council of Supply and Relief was held onMonday, the 13th inst., at the Ministry of Commerce, Paris.  A statement was beforethe Council summarising the present  position of relief work in  regard to Belgium,Northern France, South  Eastern Europe, and  Northern Europe.   Resolutions were passed as to the  appointment of committees representative  of the four associated governments to supervise arrangements in certain districts.    Generally speaking,  the  position  in regard  to Allied and liberated territories isthat there is a sufficient world supply  of food available to meet their needs.  Pendingthe presentation of the detailed report  by the representatives of the four Treasuries,it was agreed in principle that all four  countries should  participate in the financial arrangements.    Consideration  was  given to the  position of the  neutrals in  the matter of food supplies and of Bulgaria, and an agreement was  also  reached on certain  questions ofthe Coimcil&apos;s organisation.    The Food Council. Meetings of the Council were held on Thursday, January 9th,and Tuesday, January 14th.    It was decided that  proposals by the Wheat Commission to alter prices should bereferred to the Food Council before announcement, and that the Food Council shouldbe consulted before any food  supply was removed from the schedule.    The  Council considered a memorandum by the Imports Board, setting forth theeffect here of the abolition (by the United States) of restrictions on export in the caseof various articles of food, in particular frozen  and canned meat  and hog products.With regard to frozen meat  the Council took the view that  control of refrigeratedtonnage would ensure sufficient control over supplies ; with regard to canned meat itwas agreed that relaxation of control would  be  desirable and that steps should betaken  to dispose of stocks held ; with  regard to bacon and hams it was agreed that prices should be maintained for the present.    The  Council have decided that the restrictions on the purchase of cooking fats bycaterers should  be withdrawn as from  February 2nd,  but  that in the  case of lardcaterers should, like  individual customers, be required to  purchase  from supplierswith whom they are registered.    The  Council acceded to a request of the United States Naval  Authorities to takeover stores of foodstuffs in this country not now required by them.    It was agreed  that,  in view of  the serious shortage of butter  anticipated later inthe year,  the Treasury should be pressed to sanction the purchase of .11,000 tons fromthe Argentine.    A memorandum on  the de-scheduling  of rye, Rangoon beans and  other  cerealswas submitted  by the Wheat Commission.  It was agreed that the Food council should recommend the Food Controller to de-schedule and de-control rye and Rangoonbeans.  A preliminary discussion,  took  place as regards rice, and it was agreed thatINTER-ALLIED FOOD CONTROL.A (83)7191-2  Pk9  145 1/19 B&amp;SA
before any decision could be arrived  at  it was necessary to ascertain the policy of theGovernment with respect to maintaining the prices of home cereals.     The Imports Board. The Board have agreed that, subject to a report from theCondensed Milk Section of the Ministry, there will be no  need  to  place  any buyingorder for any commodity for February in the United  States.     With regard to the purchases of butter in the United States the Board report thatthe position  is as follows : The United States Food Administration have requisitioned,on behalf of the British Government, 8,000 tons of butter.   Of this quantity, contracts have been placed for 7,000 tons, and of these 7,000 tons 4,500 tons have been shipped.There are, therefore, 2,500 tons of butter on which contracts have been placed, whichhas not been shipped,  and 1,000 tons for which contracts remain  to  be  placed.   Ifthis quantity of butter is not obtained from the United States, the 1  oz. ration willnot be affected  and it would not necessarily defer the 2 oz.  ration; it would, however,mean a reversion to the 1 oz. ration at an earlier date than is  at present  anticipated.This represents the position in respect of the present season.   It  is  hoped 5,000 tonsof next  season&apos;s output (June-October)  could be  obtained but this  only representsabout 5 per  cent, of the expected  supplies during 1919.     Owing to the  large stocks of lard in this country, a cable has been sent  limiting the shipments from the United States to 2,500 tons a week.     Negotiations are proceeding for the purchase of 16,000 tons  of tallow  and premierjus from Australia.  Further steps are being taken to get imporfrestrictions on tallowand stearine removed.     With regard to the export of American bacon from this country the  Board havecabled to the Allied Provisions  Export Commission  to  the effect, that no bacon hadbeen yet exported  but that negotiations are proceeding for the export  of  12,000 tons to Holland, 2,500 tons to Norway, and  1,500  tons to  Serbia, a  total of  16,000 tons.That the question  of replacement  and the whole general position is  being discussed by Sir John  Beale  with Mr. Hoover in Paris, and that meanwhile  no orders are  to beplaced until the receipt of further instructions.     The present bacon situation is, briefly, as follows :       (i)  The Bacon Board have already stocks of  American and Canadian bacon on             hand to last for 15,  and possibly 17, weeks;      (ii) The  Army  authorities have notified the Bacon  Board that the Army will             require no more supplies at present;      (iii) If the  proposed export negotiations are  not  arranged,  the Bacon Board             will  only be able to handle 10,000, instead of 12,000 tons a week ;      (iv) A letter has been received from  the Swedish  Government Trade Office             asking : if approval may  be given to  an  importation into Sweden  of             10,000 tons of hog products from the United  Kingdom.     A cable has been sent by the Board to  the  Allied Provisions Export  Commissionto the effect  that the Treasury have cancelled all credits granted prior to November 1stby the United  States&apos; authorities, if such credits have not yet been acted upon.     It  was  agreed to  cable to  Norway requesting  the  Norwegian authorities  toauthorise  the  representative they are sending  to England,  regarding the purchaseof Argentine meat, horseflesh, and hog products, to deal with the negotiations for thesale of potatoes.     It has  been agreed that half of the  crop  of  Tasraanian apples, amounting  to17,000 tons,  should be brought along in refrigerated  space  on private account.     The Central Agricultural Advisory Council. The thirteenth meeting  was  held onthe 7th January ;  the following resolution was carried by the Council:           That  the  Presidents of the  Departments  of  Agriculture be  urged  to       appoint  a Commission.of  Inquiry in co-operation with the Board of Trade and       Ministry of Food  into the activities of the American Meat Trust,  with special       reference to the injury likely to be inflicted by such activities  upon both the       United  Kingdom  and the British  Empire pastoral  interests, and that this       Commission should consider also what  developments or trade organisations are       best fitted to safeguard and promote home production.     Further resolutions asked :        (1) That the control of feeding stuffs  should be removed at the earliest possible             moment.       (2) That a  definite intimation should be given either guaranteeing a reasonable             price for the 1919  crop&apos;of  potatoes or stating that no special  effort  to             produce is required.
       (3) That the Ministry should take immediate action to secure the release of the             men now urgently needed for the cultivation of the 1919 harvest.       (4) That the position with  regard to the distribution of basic slag and potash             should be investigated, a fair proportion of high-grade material being             allotted to the British farmer.    The Agricultural Costings Committee has been set  up jointly by the Board ofAgriculture  and  Fisheries for  England and Wales, the Board  of Agriculture forScotland, the Department  of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for  Ireland, andthe Ministry of Food.  It  is desired that  the Committee should stand in an. advisory capacity in  reference to the arrangements  made by the Government  Departmentsconcerned, or carried on under their supervision, for acquiring and utilising informationas to the costs of  farming and the financial results therefrom, and that it should seton  foot schemes  for  extending  and elaborating- the scant  information  at  present available.   For this purpose it is  intended that the  Committee should utilise to thefullest extent the Institute  for Research in Agricultnral Economics  at Oxford, which already possesses a considerable amount of detailed information.    The Consumers  Council. The Council met  on  Tuesday,  January  14th.   Thequestion of de-rationing jam was further considered.  A report  was received of theconference between representatives of  the Ministry, the Consumers&apos; Council  and theTrade.  The position is  that  the Consumers&apos;   Council  will  not  advise  the  FoodController to  take jam and  marmalade  oil the  coupon till  they can be  absolutelyassured that  the very small supplies of jam (estimated,  at two weeks&apos; ration) will beequitably  distributed.                              LABOUR CONFERENCE,    The eighth London Labour Conference was  held at Grosvenor House on  the 11thinst.,  at which 200 delegates were present from the London  Trades Councils, LabourParties and Co-operative Societies.    A resolution was carried unanimously, urging the Government to extend the scopeof these conferences to embrace the work of other Government Departments, so thatall conditions and requirements  of the workers&apos; lives  should receive consideration.Apart from several  technical  questions raised,  the conference adopted a resolutionasking  the  Government to take  over  the nation&apos;s food resources, all land, and all means of transport.                           SUPPLIES  AND DISTRIBUTION.     Bacon, Hams, and  l^ard. Arrangements have  been reached between  Englishwholesalers and  Irish wholesalers  by means of  which  the  accumulated  stocks of american short clear backs and. American cut bellies in  the hands of English whole-wholesalers will be sold to Ireland for  consumption in that country.   It is anticipated thatthis will  relieve  the trade of a large  part of  these cuts and that the dissatisfactionwhich was  felt at the difficulty of finding a market  for them in this country will cease.     The demand for lard  for the  past  two weeks through importers does not amountto the 2 oz. ration originally enforced.    &apos; Dried Fruits. Two  steamers  are reported  to have  completed loading dates atBasra.  One will sail direct to London and the other will call at Bombay.     Feeding-stuffs. Instructions have now been issued with regard to the distributionof cattle cake and meals during the remainder of the winter  season.  Certificates arebeing issued to farmers who apply, enabling them to obtain minimum supplies of cakeor meals for cows in  milk, breeding bulls, young calves and  ewes in lamb.   Suppliesnot required to meet  the certificates may  be sold  without restriction, but a preferencemust be given to farmers  wishing to-supplement the minimum allowances for cows inmilk.   Concentrated cattle feeding-stuffs other  than oil cakes and meals are being released from direct  control, but arrangements will be  made to  assist owners of theabove classes of stock and of pigs who  are unable to purchase millers&apos; offals.   &apos;     The  new arrangements do not entail a great  deal of  administrative work, and live  Stock Commissioners are  reducing their clerical, staffs,  and giving up  accomo-dation that is no longer necessary.     It is anticipated that before  the end of February the staffs  engaged on the controlof feeding-stuffs distribution will  be reduced to a  minimum.
     Meat. The arrangements referred  to in last week&apos;s Report, under which whole areas were to be supplied for given  periods with nothing but  imported  meat, have now been put into operation, and have  met  with  an appreciable measure  of success ; the prejudice against the use of  frozen  meat has disappeared, except in those remoter country districts which are unfamiliar with its value.     The stores remain full  of imported meat in  spite of the larger quantities which have  been put into  consumption.   There is a  strong  likelihood  that, with  the reduction in the continental military demands in the near future, it will be necessary to make a further increase in  the  ration in this country  in order to  absorb the supplies that will become available.     Milk. The supply of milk appears now to  be on the up  grade,  and should continue to  increase unless the winter .proves exceptionally hard  between  now  and the early spring.   The weekly  reports  from Divisional Commissioners for the week ending  11th January fully bear  out  this  conclusion.  The   situation  in  Greater London gives special cause for satisfaction.  As mentioned in the Report for the week ending November  27th, a Committee of the Wholesale Trade  has been set up under the Chairmanship of the  Home Counties Commissioner, to  which is entrusted the distribution of  all  milk reaching wholesalers who  supply Greater London.  Week by week the Committee have brought retailers&apos;  supplies up or down  to  a  proportion of 85 per cent,  of  their supplies in the  week ending 12th October.  This has been done partly by cutting  down the supplies  of retailers  above  that  level and partly  by diverting liquid  milk  from the manufacturers  of  milk  products in  particular, Messrs  Nestle.   Owing to  the  increase of  production it has been decided to raise the supplies  to wholesalers this week to 90 per cent, of their  supplies for the week ending October 12th, and, provided this can be done without diverting still more milk from manufacturers, to raise them in the following week to 95 per cent.  It is thought best to proceed  in this gradual  manner, as consumers have now grown accustomed to drink  only the  85  per cent, supply,  and it is important  that when the flush begins they should be ready to increase their consumption.  It cannot, therefore, be said that there is any serious shortage in Greater London, though it must be remembered that normally in January consumption in Greater London would be 10 per cent, above the consumption in the middle of October, and not 5 per cent, below.     The new pattern 10-gallon churn has been tested for spillage, in  the  presence of members of the Central Milk Advisory Committee.   The test Avas a severe  one; the specimens were hand-made, as the  tools are not yet ready to make  the  churn by machinery,  which  alone would  insure  precision.   The members  of the  Committee expressed themselves satisfied with  the  pattern of the churn, and a large number of orders have already been received from  the trade.                ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE or THE REALM REGULATIONS.     An  Order  amending the Apple  Prices Order  1918, dated  1.5th January 1919, permits apples  to be sold  by weight, where under the old Order  they could be  sold only by package.   The retail price is not altered.     An Order,  dated lbth January 1919, revolves  the Fruit Sales  Order,  1918.   The&quot;result  is to abolish the maximum  prices  for  summer  fruits,  and to  allow the importation into the country of fruit pulp.                             ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions&quot;  for the week ending 4th of January is 931, of which 838 resulted in convictions.     The prosecutions were reported under 69 Orders, the  greatest number being under the Rationing Order 1918, the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order 1917, and the Grain Order.     The large number of cases recorded against retailers who have exceeded controlled prices, points to the fact that profiteering is  still very prevalent.   The following is a glaring example :      A firm of wholesale grocers at Hanworth were recently charged under the Bacon, Ham and Lard, and Canned Meat (Prices) Orders.  The defendants, who had over- charged on  four occasions  for hams, and on two occassions for  canned  meat, were ordered to pay fines amounting to 1201.  and 10L 10s. costs.
PART II, SUMMARY  OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    The net imports of the principal foods and  feeding  stuffs in the week ended11th January (178,700 tons)  were slightly less than the average of the year 1918 and considerably  less  than  the  imports  in  the week ended 4th  January which wereabnormal (Table A).    There were again good  imports of wheat and flour (101,600 tons as equivalentgrain)  and improved imports of  oats (12,100 tons) and maize (7,100 tons);  meat(12,600 tons) and  bacon (15,000 tons) imports were also good.   On  the other handlard imports (600 tons) were  again low, and very small quantities of  butter (60 tons),cheese (50 tons), rice (500 tons), tea (800 tons), and coffee (80 tons) were entered.    The total imports for the lirst 19 weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19are compared in the following table ;--Total Imports for first 19 weeks of Cereal Year.*	1918.

Bread and Flour. The bakers&apos; returns for the four weeks ended January  4th show  a.further fall of 1*9 per cent, in the quantity of  flour used for  bread  and sold retail.  This cannot be taken, however, as indicating a further fall  in the level of consumption, for the decrease is  less than half the drop in the preceding two years associated with the seasonable  change of fare, and  leaves  the  level  of consumption still above that of a year ago.  If the exceptionally low figures  for Christmas week be omitted, deliveries&apos; of flour from  mills show a tendency to  increase, but further quantities will be required to replace  stocks held by bakers who had allowed them to become depleted in anticipation of further improvements  in the quality of the flour. The cancellation of army contracts is entirely responsible for the decrease of 22  per cent, in the total output of biscuit manufacturers, the decrease on this particular class amounting to 66 per cent., compared with the four  weeks  ended December 7th, and to 83 per cent, on the four weeks ended November 9th.     Meat. With  the opening of the  new year, supplies of home-fed butchers&apos; meat in Great Britain have fallen off  sharply, the estimated  supply for the week ended 4th January being 11,600 tons.  Issues of imported meat were  9,800 tons, making a total supply of 21,400 tons.  After deductions, however, for meats not coming within the ration, and for waste, estimated consumption- on the ration was slightly below the higher ration quantity  of 18,100 tons.  Home  supplies  were only  54 per cent,  of the total,  the lowest proportion which has been recorded since June.  It is likely to fall still lower in the next few months.     Milk. The index  number  for milk traffic  by railway, which is  higher  for December 1918 than for December  1917 (Table C, 4), reflects the increase in traffic caused by the diversion of milk from  districts where there was  a relatively plentiful supply, and from factories, to districts where there was acute shortage,  The quantity so diverted to London in December was 163,000 gallons.     Fish. The supplies of  fish at Billingsgate and-the other  chief  inland markets during the  week ended 4th January were  2,400 tons.   This was  a  considerable&quot;improvement on  the supplies (1,600 tons) received during  the  Christmas week, but was only  one-third of the average supplies during the first three weeks of December. The nett amount received at Billingsgate market was almost exactly the  same as the    A  7191-2                                                              B

The returns of retail prices collected by the Department of Labour Statistics as on1st January show an increase of 1  per cent, in the price of milk, which now averages8fd. a  quart, and an increase  of 5 per cent,  in potatoes, now l\d. per 7 lbs.  Theweighted average shows an  increase in prices of  &apos;4 per cent, since December, and129*6 per cent, since July 1914.    The general course of prices since the  outbreak  of war has been a three years&apos;period of rising  prices averaging 3 per cent,  per month until July 1917, by which date the increase  had amounted  to  104 per cent., a  years pause,  during  which theincrease averaged \ per cent, per month, and  again a period of rising prices from july 1918 (110 per cent, increase.) to November (133 per cent, increase) the  figures  forDecember and January being 129*0 per cent, and 129&apos;6 per cent, respectively.amount received  in  the week  ending 5th January 1918, and was respectively 7 percent, and 18 per cent, higher than the supply in the corresponding week of 1917and of 1916.                                    STOCKS.    The stocks of  the principal foods  and feeding-stuffs at the  end of the year1918 are given in  Table D and compared with  the  stocks a year ago.  It will beseen that a very substantial increase is shown in nearly all the  commodities enume-rated.   Wheat is higher by  858,000  tons, or 40 per cent, barley and maize are less,but oats, barley and maize together are higher by ^8 7,000 tons, or  10 per cent.   Sugar-stocks  are higher by 128,000 tons, or 60 per cent.  Stocks  of meat and provisions arealso higher ; meat by 49,000 tons, or 57  per cent., bacon by 37,100  tons, or  400 percent., lard  by  29,800 tons, or 828 per  cent.  Coffee and  cocoa  stocks in  bond havefallen 44 per cent., but tea stocks have been  trebled and now amount to 64,600 tonsthe highest level reached since February 1916.    The marked improvement in the food position at the end of  1918 may be shown by comparing the depletion or accumulation  of stocks of various foodstuffs during thefirst four months of the cereal years.  In 1917 the stocks of wheat fell, between the1st September and the 31st December, 35 &quot;7 per cent.; in other words, the stocks ofwheat which had, at the beginning of the cereal year amounted  to  about  28 weeks&apos;consumption, were (owing mainly to  the  falling  off in  imports) so seriously depletedthat  on the 31st December they  amounted to  only 18 weeks&apos; consumption.   In thecorresponding period of 1918 the depletion amounted to only 5  per cent.    The position of other foods also gave rise to anxiety a year  ago, notably bacon,lard, and butter, while  stocks  of tea  were very  low.   The changed position may beseen from the figures in the following table which gives the stocks at the end  of  1918and the percentage change since the 1st September  as compared with the change inthe corresponding four months of the two preceding years ; figures are added to show the change in the volume of imports.   It will be  seen that the low level of stocks of barley and maize, referred to above, is associated with a cumulative decline in imports in the autumn of 1917 and 19.18.
