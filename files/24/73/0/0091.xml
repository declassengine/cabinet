     repatriation of Germans  from China?  consequently no steps have?iXU     been taken to allocate any ships for the purpose.14)   TROOPS FROM ,BASRA.               The number of white troops which the War Office now     desire to have brought from Basra to the United Kingdom is     60,000, and the lumber of low category British troops remains     at 20,000.   In addition, the ttar Office wish approximately     200,000 native troops brought from Basra to India during the same     period, viz., January to April.   Arrangements are in hand for     the conveyance of the white troops,  and consideration is being     given to the possibility of moving the native troops at the     same time.10)   MOVE OF TROOPS TO BATOUM.               This is now almost completed, and arrangements are     being made to carry demobilised people from the  eastern theatres     up to the numbers required by the War Office.(16)   DEMOBILISATION.               35,824 demobilisers have been brought  over from France      in the three weeks ending 4th January, and arrangements have -      been made for increased numbers to be brought  over from the      15th Instant.(17)   REPATRIATION OF COLONIAL TROOPS VIA U.K.               A  serious difficulty has arisen owing to the require-      ment of  the  Colonial  Governments  that  their  troops in France      shall be repatriated  via this country,  instead of direct  from      France as agreed at the  Imperial  Conference  in 1917.    If      this is to be  carried out,  it will  necessitate putting  liners      on the Cross Channel  Service,  as  the  demands cannot  be  met      by the ordinary Cross Channel  vessels.

Rapid progress has been made in the direction of    distributing the Liner Tonnage to its normal routes, with a    consequent reduction of the liner tonnage loading from North    America,   This will in due course increase the amount of space    available for imports from the more distant countries.

4)  TONNAGE FOR GOAL..               The shortage of coal referrrd to in paragraph 6     of the letter of the 12th December, continued all through     December and for the first week in January.   During that     period therefore tonnage continued to be sent away from this     country in ballast and the supplies  to our Allies, particu-     larly to Italy, were very short.    Similarly the export of     coal to South America continued to be practically non     existent, and were it not that it was possible to arrange     for coal to be sent from the United States of America in     British ships sent across the Atlantic, there can be no     doubt that a crisis would have arisen with regard to the South     American supply.               Unless something unforeseen occurs however it seems     probable that the position will improve from now onwards.     To meet the arrears on the Italian programme which is     regarded as taking priority  over all other export programmes.,     the Goal Controller has given orders that .750,000 tons  of     coal  is to be released for Italy this month.   It is fully     anticipated that tonnage can be arranged to lift this quantity     and this will result  in the  600,000 tons programme being     covered and part of the arrears which have accumulated  since     the Armistice being made up,25)   OQffialSSIONED SHIPS.
