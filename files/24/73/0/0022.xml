LONDON, 7th January, 1919.Dear Sir Robert,        In relation to the reports of the Civil AerialTransport Committee; the draft of the proposed international convention with regard to Aerial Navigation; and the draftof a Bill for tho regulation of Aerial Navigation referredto in these reports, I desire to submit the following observations bearing upon the position of the Dominionsgenerally; and of Canada in particular, as it may beaffected by the Convention of the proposed legislation.                        I        The Convention by its terms does not apply as of right, except to the mother countries of the contracting states.  The second paragraph of Article 48 provides themethod whereby it may bo put into force in colonies,possessions or protectorates of any such State.   I would suggest that in so far as the self-governing Dominions areconcerned, their becoming bound by it should be made dependenton their adherence to itc  For this manner of dealing withan analogous case, a precedent, is found in the Treaty of 1911with Japan,  (Article XXVI). In view of the present nationalstatus of the Dominions, this seems a more fitting way ofdealing with the matter.  It puts the Dominions as towardsthe States, with whom the Convention may be entered into.in their true position as nations within the Commonwealth,                       II        Section 23 of the draft Bill makes applicable to all aircraft,  including such as may be owned by Canadiansresident or domiciled in Canada, whenever they happen tobe elsewhere than in or over the territory of the Dominion;all the provisions of the proposed Act, except so far as these provisions are expressly limited to the British.Islands and the territorial waters adjacent thereto *  Itfurther subjects to the provisions relating to the registrartion of aircraft, and. those contained in collision reguia-tions, aircraft papers regulations and signals of distressregulations, all aircraft even while in or over the territory of the Dominion, thus withdrawing, as regards these particu-lar matters, from any control by Dominion legislation,aircraft,  whether Canadian or Foreign even while withinCanadian Territory,        Sub-section 2 of this section makes clear that in theregards just mentioned, it is intended, by the Bill to limit the power of the Parliament of the Dominion, or the legisla-tures of any of its provinces, to make provision in relationto itself or its territory.        Tne enactment of such limitation is doubtless legallywithin the power of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.The exercise of that power is, however, I submit, uncon-stitutional0The
     The proposed legislation, as appears by what is abovestated, not only governs all air craft the PROPERTY ofCanadians whenever they &quot;pass beyond the limits of Canada,but furthermore as regards the particular matters of registration, oollisions, aircraft papers, and signals of distress, gov forms and subjects to regulations to bo madeunder its StT^isions&apos; all aircraft, Canadian and foreign,while actually within Canadian territory.     That, under the Provisions of the Canadian ConstitutionalAots, all these matters are  Proper subjects of legislation,either by the Parliament of the Dominion,  or the legislaturesof the provinces, does not appear to be open to question.Indeed as has boen pointec out, sub-section 2 of Section23 of the Bill practically concedes the the United XingdomParliament in dealing with them, limits the powers conferred upon the&quot; legislative bodies of the Dominion.   This actionconstitutes an invasion of Canada1s rights as conferred upon har by the Act of 1867 and 110 different amendmentsthereto.  As such it is o.e m to the gravest objection, whichit seems but proper should bo brought to the notice of theImperial Cabinet.     So far as, with regard to the particular matters in question it may be doomed desirable that there shouldbe uniformity of law tfttoiin the Commonwealth,, thatuniformity can, without difficulty, be brought about byconcurrent action of the legislatures of the different parts.     The -principle t lat it is the constitutional right ofthe self-governing Dominions to legislate exclusively withregard to subjects ooming within the purview, of the powerscoaf:rred upon thorn is too well established,, and too fully&apos;recognised, for it to be necessary to insist ueon it.     It will doubtless bo sufficient to ensure its beingrespected in the present instance, that attention shouldbe called to the fact that the enactment by the Parliamentof the United Kingdom of the  provisions above referred to,would be a violation of that principle.Yours sincerely7,  (Sgd). CHAS J. &quot;LOffiJEIY.
