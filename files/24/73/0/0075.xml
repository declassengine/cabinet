6 ftMEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLERtn the 6th of last month Mr. niynes submitted amemorandum to the Cabinet on the subject of Beer itsoutput,  gravity,  and price.  As I understand that thismemorandum has not yet been before the Cabinet I desireto press for their early consideration of this matter with a view to a decision being taken.      The throe recommendations made were:-  -(a)  an increase in the present statutory barrelage of 25$:(b)  an increase of 2 degrees on the average gravity at     which Brewers may brew their total permitted output:(c) .(a comprehensive revision of retail prices as shown&apos;     ir^K) Schedule attached to the original memorandum      At the suggestion of Mr. Bonar Lav; this Schedule hasbeen the subject of further discussion and revision by theMinistry of Food, Board of Customs &amp; Excise and the Central    agreed upon in general by these Departments  is  now presented    to be substituted for the one introduced into the    Memorandum of December 6th,  19IP.          This scale of prices is conditional upon  the acceptance    by the Cabinet of tho recommendations regarding increased    output and increased average gravity.3.         As pointed cut in the  original memorandum the above    recommendations do not conflict in any respect  with the    &quot;nine points&quot; programme recently put forward by the    Temperance Council with which the Prime Minister has    expressed general agreement.          I am desirous of drawing your attention to my anxiety    over the very pronounced state of unrest and agitation in    the country, and to point out that I cannot  be responsible    for the trouble that must arise if the matter is further &apos;    delayed,          The revised scale of prices does not apply to Ireland.
