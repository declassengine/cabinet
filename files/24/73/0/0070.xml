During the week there have beon 3 more outbreaks,  2 ofthem in Cornwall, and the other in Devon.   The number of reportsreoeived of suspected cases was 3 only.          During the statistical week ending 11th ihst. thero have been14 outbreaks of swine-fever, 3 of anthrax, 17 of sheep-scab,  198  ofparasitic mange and 4 of foot-and-mouth disease.   The re-introductionof the latter disease is unfortunate, but not altogether unexpected.                          Veterinary Department.     Anti-swine-fever serum.   2,000 c.c. were issued for distribution to 3:eep up the stocks at the various centres.     Anti-abortion vaccine.   23,400 c.c. (465 doses) were manufactured,put up in a suitable form,- and despatched for use on infected farms.     Rabies.   During the week in question specimens in connectionwith 1 suspected outbreak were received for examination.          The other routine work of the laboratory in respect ofswine-fever, etc., went oh as usual.                          Fisheries Division.   -  Disposal of Waste Explosives.   The War Office are anxious to get rid of large quantities of waste explosives, mainly Amatol, and have proposed to dump them in the sea.   General Fortescue, who is adviser on the Shipment of Explosives at the War Office, called at 43,Parliament Street to inquire whether such dumping was likely to doinjury to fishery interests.   This aspect of the matter is underconsideration, but in the meantime the question is to be referredofficially to the Board by the War Office, as there is the possibility that a part at least of the waste explosives might be utilised formanurial purposes for agriculture.   When General Fortescue calledhe was under the impression that the Amatol which was to be dumpedcontained the usual percentage of something between 60  and Q0% of ammonia nitrate, but ho has subsequently telephoned to say that hefinds that the product is waste amatol, and contains only some 2% toZ%*   Full particulars will shortly be sent to the Board.     The Future of the Herring Trade.  &apos; An informal conference hasbeen held at 43, Parliament Street between representatives of scottish and English herring interests, Mr. David Jones of theScottish Fishery Board and the Assistant Secretary, to discuss thsquestion of the export of herrings.   The points to which importance is chiefly attached by herring experts is that the present             \resolutions on export should as far as possible be removed.   Thefclimstiy of Food are understood nor; to be prepared to agree tounrestricted export to approved destinations, which,in effect means    Jdestinations other than Scandinavia, Holland, Germany: and, for thepresent at any rate, Russia.   This will relieve the situation aeregards the immediate future, v/hich was becoming rather critical.The price of a.!l gear is high, fishermen and ownerB were hesitatingto equip their vessels for the winter herring fishery unless theycould have some assurance that they would have liberty to exportsurplus fish which had been pickled.          Another point of importance as regards the herring tradeis the development of trade with Russia-.   As to this a conference has been held with Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, Director of theDepartment for the Restriction of Enemy Supplies, who is chargedwith
   with matters affecting Pvussian trade.    Ht  it  eympathetic, but       243   naturally pointe out that  everything dependi upon  tho  development  ef   the situation in Russia.    All pessisilities in thii direotion  are   being Kept carefully In view.    At Russia And  Oormany  in  pre-war days   consumed between thorn approximately 65$ of  tho total oaten Cf herrings   In the United Kingdom, the questien of thQ  horring export trade ie one : requiring groat care.  It is  anticipated that euffioient markets willI I be found for the winter h*rring catch  at hone  and  in Belgium, Franced &apos;   Italy, the Mediterranean and the United States of  Amcrioa.   ^          VesaeH frs, ,fi,eh IrpJtetwssfl.**Uh, trawlers, the   first contingent ft a fleet of 16 vessele whioh. under an Agreement   made by the Department for the Restriction  of  Enemy Supplies, are  being   permitted to fish from Fleetwoed, are  now on their way, and others will   arrive in batches in the course of the next three  weeks.   It is   probable that the arrival  of these vessels  will eause  some irritation   among British fishery interests.   In  particular,  men  who are awaiting   demobilisation will objeot to  foreigners being allowed to exploit  the   fishing grounds from British ports while they  are  not  free to fish.   The situation is an unfortunate one, hut it could  not  he  avoided.   When the Agreement was made the war wae still  in progress, and  while,   on the one hand, it was thought necessary to do something for the   Dutch fishermen who have suffered heavily by our restriction of their   operations, it was also under  the then existing conditions very   desirable to Increase the  quantity of  fresh fish landed at British   ports*   The situation is  now, of course, completely changed, but  thej   Dutch, who are still in difficulties on their  elde, claim the fulfil-   ment of the Agreement, which could not he refused.  It is thought   that a frank explanation of the situation will relieve any irritationI   that may he felt among British fishermen,  the situation is well   understood now in Fleetwood.        PMfoxmen&apos;s/e^ra^on ana; fteoru^tm          &apos; 1,216 names  of   men recommended for pivotal release from the Army  or Air  Force  have   been submitted to date to  the Kinistry of Labour.   The inland   distribution cases are slow in coming  in as completed  recommendations,   although some 700 applications have  been received.   The  Ministry  of   Food has, at the request cf the Section, issued a  circular telegram   te Divisional Officers asking them to  accelerate any recommendation   they wish to make, so that allocations not  required can he utilised   for the ooast.             The return of trawlers has led to a  change;  in the  situation   in regard to the manning  of fishing vessels, actual shortage being   experienced in some ports.   The Ministry of Labour state that  fisher*   men returned te barracks  owing to the  paying off of a vessel  can   obtain release on making  out a good case to their  Commanding  Officer   that fishing wort awaits them.        Permit Section.   The fishing areas in the Thames Estuary  have   now been increased considerably.   This extension, taken in conjunction   with the permission to fish at night,  granted  last mcnth, rspresents a   great improvement in the  position of fishermen in   this area.        Education Branch.    The work of the week was mainly concerned   with correspondence regarding the estimates of the expenditure  for   1919-20 of the Various educational and research institutions with   which the Board are connected.   Correspondence relating to the   demobilisation of educational officers has alec been     sjctive.             In the rural education section the Branch has been occupiedI  with payments of grants in respect of the current  f ns^o*al year.        Eublications lrancftf   The number of applications tor ordinary   issues of The leaflets wae 614,  in response to which 3,198 copies were   despatched,.   In add it lea M,tOO copies  of the leaflets wert despatched   to  applicants fcr  supplies  in bulk, for  distribution.  &apos;             Applications were reoeived for 322  copies cf the Three Bound   Volumes  of Leaflets,  and 395  copies of  the pamphlet &quot;How tt Manage an                                                            Allotment&quot;

The usual enquiries hearing directly and indirectly enagricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the branch.     Officers&apos;  Training Branch,  -  A Circular Letter has been preparedfor issue to Locaf AuthoFities setting out fully the procedure to beadopted for dealing with applications by officers for &quot;farm training&quot;,and the method of paying allowances etc/   A few counties havoforwarded names cf farmers who are willing to train &quot;officer pupils&quot;and the remaining counties are preparing lists of such farmers.          Some 70 letters and 30 callers are being received dailyconcerning the Scheme,   Enquiries have been received from officers at such distances as Italy and Egypt.     fflax: Production Branch.   The output of seed during week ending9th J&quot;anuary was 2j 515 cwts. as against last wee3:, a total of 1,640cwts.   The total&apos;output of dressed seed to the same date 12,202 cwts.The steady improvement in the output which is noticeable is chiefly due Ito improved organisation.   -Owing to delays in the erection ofmachinery, 3 of the largest factories have not yet commenced operations.                             frand Division.     Land Settlement through County Councils.   The Board have issued a further Circular Letter to County Councils and Councils of county boroughs containing particulars of the financial arrangements made forthe settlement on the land of ex-Service men.   The Circular conveysthe decision of the G-cvernment that while the County Councils are themost suitable bedies to be entrusted with the local administration ofthe matter, the financial responsibility for the loss which must inevitably occur in creating small holdings under present conditions should be borne by the Exchequer and no charge should be placed on local rates.   It is confidently expected that this decision will result in the acquisition of land by County Councils being greatlyaccelerated.        .  In addition to the land of which particulars were given inlaBt week&apos;s report, the  Somerset County Council have purchased atauction some 55 acreB, part of the Ven Estate,. Milborne Port, for thesum of  2,064.     Small Holding Colonies.      Patrington.   The usual seasonal- farming operations have con*tinued as far as possible, but the land is  still very wet and it  isdifficult to keep the ploughs going-,      Hclbeach,  &apos; iho main work on the Colony haB been ploughing  anddrilling wheat, and riddling and carting  potatoes.   Considerabledifficulty is still being experienced  in getting  potatoes dispatchedfrom the  Station quickly, but it has been arranged  with an official of the Potato Control Department at Boston.to visit the Director  ofthe Colony, when  it is hoped  that  satisfactory arrangements will bemade.     Heath Hill Colony.      Threshing and  ploughing-have been thechief  operations of the  week.   &quot;No freBh  settlers have arrived,
Blfoam Estate.     Threshing:,  Owing  largely to  the.wt  gloomy  weather  threshing has not  been  in  progress for  the  past three weeks.    So  far,  101  qrs. of wheat,  316 qrs.  of  oats,  and  36 qrs.  of barley have  been sold,  the  bull: of tho  wheat making the maximum price.    The oats have averaged 64/- per  qr. and  barley  7S/- per qr.          Wheat  yields are not very  large,  the heaviest  crop  being  5 qrs     acre.    Oats are yielding a good  average so  far,  in  one instance 10     per  acre.    The barley is only moderate both in yield and  quality.     Transplanting  of  Boot Seodlin&amp;s.  As  it is desirable to make  the     use  of  the-&quot;prisoner  labour and  to reduce the pressure of work  inperqrs.mostthe spring, transplanting operations have20 acres out cf the 100 have been sot outThe seedlings are very strong, have got anot in the least affected by frost.   the will be about 50/- per acre.

The Provincial Live Stock Committees have been asked ttallocate the live stock grant between the counties in their Provinces,and the Agricultural Institutions are being notified of the decision ofthe Treasury in regard to the Live Stock Officers.lb                            Commercial Control Branch.          The work of the Branch during the week has consisted of nquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport and extended commercial control after the war, railway facilities f*rcattle V the Midland Railway and Great Western Railway and en matters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Aots and theFertilisers and Feeding StuffB Act.Local
          Looal Transport enquiries have  been made in districts tfHereford and Montgomery,   A number sf reports have ieon reoeivedfrom the Officers of the Roa.d Transport Board as to districts, in  :addition to those already reported to this Beard, requiringadditional transport facilities,  , They will now make a detailedenquiry into the circumstances of certain&apos;-selected districts and theresults will be reported to the Board, -  -&apos;  &apos;                        Statistical Division,     Statistical Branch,    The Treasury have agreed to the collectionof the Agricultural Returns being transferred from the Customs and excise to this Bftard.   The main: work done during the week haB beenthe re-arrangement of the Crsp Reporters districts (involving anincrease of some 50 per cent, in their number) necessitated by thenew work whioh is to bo imposed upon them*   This is proceedingrapidly.          The quantity if sea fish landed in England and Wales during december was just over 300,000 cwts., ss against 233,000 owts. in theprevious December.   The total quantity, landed during the entire year -1918 was 4,680,000 owts. - some 630,000 cwts. more than in 1917;  but little more than a quarter of the maximum reached in 1913,   Theincrease in 1918 was all in the last thres months and largely due tothe greater catch of herrings.     agricultural gages Board.   The twenty-fifth meeting of the board was held on the 9th January.          Sir Henry Rew presented a report from the &quot;Administration&quot;Committee dealing with  (a) abtion taken in regard t,p complaints pf  *non-payment of. the minimum rates, and  (b) the rates of payment to bemade to prisoners of war employee, in agriculture.   The Boardauthorised the institution of legal proceedings against an employer inHampshire for non-payment of the minimum rates and .to.ok steps to expedite the institution of proceedings in other. Suitable oases.They also expressed their intention of prosecuting, in any case in which an employer dismisses or threatens ts dismiss a worker as a result ofaction taken to secure payment of the minimum rates or the.paymentof arrears of wages* 1          The Beard found themselves unable to agree with a proposal of the Army Council that prisoners of war employed, in agriculture .should be paid at less than the minimum rates fixed by the-, wages board on account of the extra,expenditure incurred by the farmer inconnection with emplsyment of sueh workers.   They decided to informthe Army Council that in thoir opinion no foreign prisoner of war should be employed in.this country in agriculture at a less wagepayment than the minimum wage, for the  district fixed by the wages board, and that the expense for conveying or guarding these menahouldbe paid.by the authorities responsible for them.         ... Cases having been reported in which yearly hiring contractshad been made, providing for payment of workers at less than theminimum rates fixed by. the Board, it was decided to issue a notice tothe Press and to inform the District V/ages Committees that yearlyhiring contracts tr any other agreement, for the payment of wages at less than the minimum rates fixed by the Board were void, and thatthe making of such contracts and tho payment of vrages in accordancetherewith would render the employer liable to prosecution.          Considerable discussion took place in regard to the motion,of which notice had been given by kr. Smith on behalf of thoRepresentatives
Representatives of Workers, that the rates f$f wages fixed &quot;by the BraiJdshould be increased by  1 per week.   It was oventually decided,against the vote of the Workers&apos; Representatives, that furtherconsideration r,f the matter bo adjourned to the first meeting in Marchin order that an opportunity might be given for the Board to receiveand discuss the Report from the Committee $a &quot;Farming Coots and cost of Li-iring&quot;&apos;,   Recommendations which had been received from thoSomerset, and the Dorset District Wages Committees for increase in theminimum rates fixed wore also deferred until the general question asto an increase should have boon decided.          The Board decided to give formal Notice of Proposal toprovide for payment of overtime rates to all classes of workers inrespect if all employment in excess of 6-J- hours on one day in each week.          During the week, 124  oases of complaint of non-payment ofthe minimum rates were received, the largest number from any oneoounty b9ing 20 in the case of Hampshire, 38 cases were sent to the inspectors for visit;  enquiries by correspondence were made in 196cases;  and 43 oases were completed.   Reports were received fromInspectors in 17 oases     Tithe, Copyhold, Commons and  Survey Branch.   The return cf themembers of the compulsory tithe redemption staff frm active service has enabled the Branch,to proceed  with some of the compulsoryredemption cases which had been suspended at the outbreak of war.Judging from the many enquiries reoeived on the subject, there is every reason to think that Compulsory redemption work will increase considerably in the near future.          It having been suggested in certain quarters that theeffect of the redemption of tithe  rentcharge is to increase thoincrement value *f the land and so rendur the landowner liable teincreased taxation under the Finance (1909-10) Act, the j3$ard have beerin communication with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue on thesubject.   The Commissioners point out that under Section 26(3) of thoAct the &quot;total value&quot; of land is arrived at by deducting from the&quot;gross value&quot; the amount by which  the &quot;gross value&quot; would be diminished if tho land wore sold subject to any fixed ohargos, and bythe definition given in the Act &quot;fixed charges&quot; include titherentcharge-   Tithe rentchargo was therefore a deduction for thopurpose of arriving at the &quot;original site value&quot; under the Act whiohis derived from the &quot;total value&quot;  of any land.   The &quot;site value&quot; ofland on any occasion for the collection of Increment Value Duty is tobe&quot;computed under section 2(2) of  the Act, which in conjunction with section 25(4)(d) allows of the deduction of any part of the !;total value&quot; on the occasion which is proved to the Commissioners&apos;of InlandRevenue to be directly attributable te the expenditure pf money on theredemption of any fixod charge  (whioh as before stated includes TitheRentcharge).    In those circumstances,  there seems no ground for thesuggestion above referred to.          The examination of private bills foS the ensuing Session has proceeded.   Among them is the Manchester Corporation Bill, 1018,which provides, inter alia, for the taking of common land mainly inWestmorland,  not exceeding 13,400 acres, for the purposes of thewater supply of the city.             Joint Committee of ftoard of Agriculture and Fisheries                          -  and Ministry of Food,          The principal work of the Committee during the week has boonin organising for a fresh propaganda in connection with tho prevontionof the spread of Parasitic i^ange among Horses.    A considerablenumber
number of letters havo been received during the past few weeks fromwidely separated parts of the oountry which clearly show that thospread of the disease is not confined to one particular district.Requests for the Joint Committeds leaflets sn the disease havo,during the week, been received from Central America and Japan.          No. 24 of the publication &quot;Weekly Notes&quot; has boon issuedduring the weeke                         Ordnance, Survey.          Maps were despatched as followsi-        War Office  ......  618         Overseas .....  9100        Air Ministry    ..,12189         Other Services   218        Admiralty.......,   44                       Establishment Branch.          A considerable number &amp;f the Board1s staff who havo been on active service aro now being demobilised and will soon be resumingtheir Civil duty in the Department.   In many cases it will benecessary to assign these men to new sections and fresh work, and thismatter is being dealt with by a Sub-Committee appointed to considerthe allocation of staff returning frem active servioe.          The Board continue to experience the greatest inconveniencein the matter of Office accommodation.          Notwithstanding the distribution of the Board&apos;s staff insome fifteen different sets of Offices the process continues andfurther accommodation is urgently required for the staff  necessa^ 1 t^deal with the new scheme of land Reclamation.   The Office ef      Wsrksare unable to provide accommodation in the vicinity of Whitehall,and the Board will be compelled to accept rooms at SOKF considerable distance fromrHoadquarters.   It is extremely difficult for the workto be oarried on under such conditions.    Very important work isbeing greatly hindered awing to this chronic trouble of office accommodation and it is to be earnestly hoped that it may be found possible at a very early date to give the Board possession of armament Building which was lent to the idinistry of Munitions at theoutbreak of war.                              Land Reolamation.          An organisation to deal with this work is now being set up and has already reviewed some proposals.   The Land Reclamation Societywhich has done valuable work in considering and reporting upon many areas  suitable for reclamation has handed over its rooerds to theBoard  7ho aro thus enabled to take advantage of the preparatory stepsand enquiries taken by that Body.          The schedules ef suggestions submitted by War agricultural committees are also being considered.in previou                                                Secretary.15th January, 1919.
