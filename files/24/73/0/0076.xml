                                                      (/ This  Document is  the Property of His Britannio Majesty1a Government.                             War Cabinet.                   &quot;Demobilisation of Agriculturists&quot;.Memorandum hy  the  President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.      1,   It was originally anticipated that the decision to include Igriculture among the few industrial groups open for demobilisation would seult in large numbers of agriculturists being released in time to assist ith the work of spring cultivation,  The recently reported change in the eraobiliBation scheme must delay the release of the main body of these men ad a serious situation from the point of view of food and milk production fill arise unless special steps are immediately taken to meet it.  The usition is briefly as follows :-      2.   It is estimated that over 300,000 agriculturists were recruited or the Army during a period in which the area under orops in this country ss been increased by two million acres.  In order to help farmers to toomplish this result the Board provided 70,000 soldiers and 30,000 nieoners of *.&apos;ar.  Of the soldiers approximately 25,000 v/ere not in agricul- h before the war.  All soldiers on the land are now being demobilised by lie Military Authorities as quickly as possible and the men not in agricul- ure before the war are returning to their former occupations.  Included long these men are practically the whole of the men working the Board&apos;s ractors, 4,000 in number.  The services of the prisoners of war will also jlost before long and in any case the withdrawal of these men from farm irk at the earliest possible date is advisable in order to avoid diffi- iltifls arising with labour.  Agriculture must therefore lose almost mediately the 25,000, and possibly 30,000 prisoners who cannot be retained  the latest after the signature of peace,      3.   The inclement weather of the last four months has also seriously Jlayed agricultural operations.  Reports show that farm work is about six soles later than usual in most parts of the country.  Unless large areas are  bear no crops at all for next harvest, an enormous amount of work will are to be compressed within the few spring weeks commencing about the  ginning of Uarch,      4.   As an offset against the large and certain loss of labour above- [sntioned, Agriculture has in prospect only the  &quot;pivotal&quot; men.  The Board fte now been invited to increase their allotment of 15,000 such men. fditional names, are being collected, but it is unlikely that more than 5S000 - 30 000 names can be listed in the short  tine allowed.  Moreover Jong the &quot;pivotal&quot; men are included surveyors, land-agents, organisers,iied experts, etc., who will not fill the places  of any  of  the 55,000 men *st to actual cultivation of the soil, x     5.   It is obvious that a grave emergency  will arise in the  spring Pth disastrous effects on food production in this country, unless  steps p taken to release quickly a substantial number of men  for the  agricultural Industry.  I consider that the minimum number of  men  required  to meet  the urgency is 50,000 in addition to  30,000  &quot;pivotal&quot; men, i.e.  80,000 men  in p.  All Bhould be released before the end of  February  and the  Board will Ijiertake to supply the names of the men  required by  the middle  of  February.K.E, PKOTiiEHO.20th January,  1919.
