Inquiry has  been made into  oases  of alleged poisoning amongst  horses  of  the Pood Production Department, and It was found t*t. be bracken poisoning  from  bracken  inducted  in the chaff.          There is  some  reason to believe that in  the  West  Suffolk district this material is  being used to a certain  &quot;extent  for  horses., If this  is so,  we may expect furthor accidents.                           Fisheries  Division.     Oyster  Fisheries at Poole Harbour.  At an interview with  tho Chairman and&apos; Clerk  of the  Southern  Sea Fisheries Committee  the  various difficulties connected with the Oyster Fisheries at Poole Harbour were diseussed.   The fishery is. much  polluted and  tho  Order provides  that, when a place of deposit  for cleansing  has boon approved withdn  the fishery, oysters from this fishery inay not  be  sold until  thoy have teen relatid  for purification in  the  approved waters.    For  various reasons  it has  not  yutboon found possible  to  approve  such  areas, and the question is now under  consideration whether itJ is  possible  under the Order to allow  the oysters to be taken  for deposit in seme  clean waters outside  the  fishery.     Herring Expert Trade.   Tho  Assistant  Secrotary  received a Imputation from the British Herring  Export  Association who  desired  tipIfiiscuss  tho  futuro  of the  herring export  trade.    They wero anxious to secure the maintenance  cf their  continental trade  in herring,  which they estimated  as not less than  1/30th of the  total landings  of fish in this  country.    They  wished to continue  their normal supplies  to  the ^erman market,  but  to excludo German buyers from British ports  because,   they  alleged, tho operations  of  the latter  had  the  effect  of depressing the  market to their own  advantage,,  and  thoy suggested                                                            the
the establishment of a Buroau or Fishery Office at the, German Porte of landing through which all tho herring accounts should pass, so that a check could be kept on all proceedings. They were also desirous of facilities for the direct supply of herring to the Russian market. The Assistant Secretary promised that their representations should be considered.

Harbour Construction. The Demobilisation Authorities have approached the Development Commissioners with a view to loarning what plans they have for new harbour construction and similar works which might in case of necessity be used as means of providing relief labour for unemployed demobilised men. As a result of a conference with Mr. ?arner of the Development Commission, it is proposed to send a small Departmental Committee to visit a number of harbours on the North-East Coast, on behalf of some of whioh applications for grants for development have been made, and to consider the situation that coast as a whole, and tp report immediately.

Scheme for assisting Fishermen. The Division have had under consideration the possibility of assisting fishermen who, when released from Military Service, find their boats or gear to have been injured or  deteriorated in value, and further, whether any means could bofound to provide boats or gear in deserving cases. It is understood that the Military Service (Civil) Liabilities Department, have also had the matter under consideration and are prepared to consider applications from fishermen for compensation in respect of deterioration of boats or gear while the man was on Active Service, and the Board are communicating with that Department with a view to securing joint action in any suoh cases.

New Bills to be introduced in Parliament. Preliminary consideration has been given to a considerable number  of Bills to be introduced in the coming Session, conferring powers, inter alia, for the abstraction of water from  rivers.

Export of wet, dried fish, and pickled and smoked herrings. The War Trade Department have notified us that  they are prepared to consider applications for the expert to approved destinations of all wet and dried salted fish, and of pickled and smoked herrings.

Army and Air Force Demobilisation. The number of pivotal names submitted for demobilisation from the Army and Air Force to date has reached 1,552. The allocation of pivotal men is to be increased by the ministry of Labour as regards Army men. The names have to be sent in by the 27th  inst., and immediate instructions were issued  to the Board&apos;s Local Inspectors, and Port fishery Committees.

Naval Demobilisation. The Admiralty has intimated that they find it necessary to restrict the number of men  demobilised, and it is understood that the Board  will be requested in future to grade  their names into (1)  the most urgently needed, who should receive permission to leave their ships within 48 hours of demobilisation papers reaching the vessel, unless an exceedingly urgent case for their retention can be made and (2) men not so urgently reeded who would be treated under the "contract" system; the employers and men being advised.

Motor Power in Fishing Boats. Ever since they commenced operations in 1917 the Motor Loan Committee have been anxious for an opportunity of putting an engine into a North East Coast beaching coble. Arrangements were put in train for such an installation in 1917 but the scheme could not be carried through owing to the owner of  the vessel falling ill. Now, however, arrangements have been finally concluded for an engine to be installed in a new vessel to be built for three Flamborough men.

The 
The connversion of the cable to motor power does not in itself present any difficulty; it is the fact that  the vessels have to be beached on most awkward beaches which makes the problem one needing a considerable amount of cars. The Committee are however confident that the first installation will be a success, and that a large number of others will follow rapidly.

Intelligence Division.

Education Branch. The principal activities of the Branch during the week have been concerned with correspondence relating to enquiries regarding educational facilities. It is becoming evident that the existing educational institutions will have some difficulty in coping with the demand that has arisen for instruction  in agricultural subjects.

Much correspondence is also taking place regarding the Board&apos;s Poultry Schemes which are now in process of  inauguration for a new Season. The recent announcement of the new terms upon which grants in aid ff rural educational schemes will be made has begun to arouse groat interest and it is becoming evident that considerable extensions of educational activities on the  part of Local Education Authorities is likely to    ensue in the near future.

Dairy Branch. Arrangements are being made, subject to Treasury sanction, to establish and conduct a Lactose Factory for the purpose of demonstrating the commercial possibilities in the manufacture of lactose and other by-products from  whey.

The necessity for the demonstration  has arisen inconsequence the great waste which has been occasioned during  the past few years in connection with cheese factories, where, owing largely to the decrease in the number of pigs, it has not been possible to put whey to any profitable use.

Arrangements have not been made with the Cheshire Education Authority for an Intensive milk Production demonstration to be carried out on their farm at Henhull.

With respect to the Cheesemaking Instruction given during 1918 season under the Board&apos;s Scheme for the Encouragement of Cheesemaking, the returns so far obtained show that 100 Instructresse were employed, that 77  Travelling Cheese Sohools were in operation and that 18 Co-operative Cheese Schools were hold. Instruction was given at 715 Centres; advice in Cheesemaking was given at 2,142 farms and the total number of persons  instructed in cheesemaking was 1O,040

Publications Branch. The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets as 512, in response to which 3,344 copies were despatched.

In addition 11,500 copies of the Leaflets were despatohed to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.

Applications were received for 388 copies of the Three Bound Volumes of Leaflets and 269 copies of the  pamphlet "How to Manage an Allotment" were sent out.

The January issue of the Board&apos;s Journal was received from the Printers and distributed.

The usual enquiries boaring directly and indirectly on agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by the Branch.

Officers&apos;
Officers&apos; Training Branch. A Meeting of the Officers  Agricultural Training Committee has been called for the  22nd inst, to make a preliminary selection of Candidates who have already applied free Scholarships and to advise on the procedure to be adopted in the award of Scholarships. Over 50 candidates have so far applied.   Very numerous enquiries - both written and verbal - continue to be received concerning the Training Scheme  -  the bulk being as regards "residential farm training".

It is understood semi-officially from the Ministry of Labour that of the Officers who enquire about training  on demobilisation, no fewer than 30% ask for agricultural training.

The machinery for dealing with applications for "residential farm training is practically complete. Very few lists of farmers willing to receive "Officer pupils" have so far  been received from County Councils, but a number of Councils report that lists are being prepared.

Flax Production Branch. The output of Seed during the week ending 16th January 1919 was 2,650 ?,as compared with 2,515 ? last week. The total output of dressed seed to date is 14,852 ?. The output has been hampered by continual breakdowns of machinery.

Land Division.

? Holding Colonies.

Holbeach. The horse work on the Colony during the week consisted of ploughing and drilling wheat when weather permitted. The principal work of the settlers has been riddling potatoes, but the dispatch of the potatoes from the Colony is still unsatisfactory, and the Director is dealing with the matter.

Heath Hill. A continuation of the wet weather is hindering. The tractors and horses have been ploughing when the weather was suitable. The threshing has proceeded. 58 Steers have been purchased at an average cost of £21. 10. 0. 132 quarters of barley and 5 tons of potatoes have been sold.

Land Settlement through County Councils.

During the week the following purchases by County Councils of land under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908, mainly for the purpose of providing small holdings for ex-Service men, were submitted to the Board and are still under consideration:-



 County Council.     Parish       Acreage       Purchase

                    (Merry Farm)  

The Yorkshire (West Riding) County Council purchased 13\\1//2 acres to Ingleton for the sum of £680.

? Estate.

The last fortnight has been very wet but work has not been handicapped to any great extent. With the exception of one day all the horses and men have worked full time.

Threshing has been in progress for the past fortnight and so far 3 stacks of oats and one stack of barley have been threshed, all being from the old arable land at Averham. Considering the land was some of the worst we have, the following yields are fairly satisfactory -

Oats   
        Oats.  199 qrs* from 38 acres:  5 qrs. 1 &quot;bus,  por acre.        Barley,  50 qrs, from 18 acres:  3 qrB. per aoro.

The total number of Reporters under the new scheme will be just about 350, as compared with 220 previously.  the list of Reporters has also been examined and thoso oonsiderodcapablo of undertaking the new work have boon elected.   The fourInspectors of the Statistical Division are now engaged in findingsuitable men for the now districts.

Joint Coamittoo of Board of Agriculture and Fisheries                      &apos; and Ministry of Pood.          Considerable anxiety is expressed in numerouscommunications from potato grovers as to the delivery of their crop,and the instances of wastage given demonstrate tho difficulty in assessing in its proper proportion the question of &quot;abnormalwastage&quot;,          Similar anxiety is rovoalcd as regards tho Cereal prices for the 191? fearvost and the Joint Committee continue to reoeiverequests from correspondents for an assurance that such prices will be obtained.          Tho no-./ Ministry of Food leaflet, L.G.

College Street for the accommodation of the offioe   -staff who will deal with the business arising under the Scheme for theReclamation of Land.   Arrangements have also been made for the separate housing of a section of the Pood Production Department.          It cannot be too strongly emphasised that no effectiveorganisation of thu- Boardoperations, a3 a whole, can besecured whilst the process continues of distributing the Board&apos;8administrative staff in a number of small, offices at some distance from Headquarters.   It involves much delays and waste of energy;  an absence of adequate supervision, - loss ofco-ordinated effort in regard to services common to theDepartment as a whole, entails additional expenditure in many directions and is altogether wasteful and disorganising.It is to be hoped that a serious effort will be made to dealwith this urgent problem at an early date in the manner suggested in previous reports.          The normal work of the Board proceeds on linos asIndicated in previous reports.Secretary.22nd January, 1919.
