Gimient is the Property of His Britairaig Majestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.                        POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT^                                                   FOREIGN OFFICE, [January 17, 1919.]UTA^V     ,0                                               SWEDEN  /Oil.Ml1  Oi &quot;-*               MEMORANDUM                      on constitutional REFORM IN SWEDEN.    ON the 17th December last a Bill  was passed by the Riksdag in  the  first chamber after a long debate but without a division, in the Second by 167&quot; votes to 12 which marks for Sweden a great step forward on the democratic path.    One has firstly to note that the proposals incorporated in the Bill are. the product of the labours of a special Franchise Committee consisting of members of all parties, andthat, consequently, no opposition to them was, or is, to be expected, except from  a fewintraDsigeants  of the  &quot; Eight &quot; and a section of the Extreme Socialist party.   Secondly,that as measures involving changes in the constitution may only be introduced  in an ordinary session  of the Riksdag, such measures as an extension of the franchise for theSecond Chamber alluded to in the Bill and the introduction of political female suffragehad to be left over until the spring, as the  autumn Riksdag was sitting in extraordinarysession.    The first  of these measures will lower  the voting age from 24 to 23 years of age and abolish the penalty of loss of vote in  the  case of  non-payment of taxes.   the duration of the Second Chamber will be extended from three to four years.    The second measure, not alluded to in the Bill, is one which  was thrown out in theUpper House last March, but which now the Conservatives, constrained by circumstances,,have promised not to oppose.    Turning now to those clauses in the Bill which deal with the communal vote, these canbe put into force at once.   Actually and in fact, the changes introduced very materiallyaffect the composition of the First Chamber.  Technically, however, as they concern the communal and not the political franchise, they can be introduced  in an extraordinarysession.   This  fact the Liberal-Socialist Government took advantage of, though faced atfirst with stout opposition from  the  Conservatives,  who for  a  time, insisted thatconstitutional changes of the kind should be dependent on the result of new elections.    In order to appreciate  the change  in the composition of the First Chamber whichwill be brought about, it is essential to have  some knowledge of the somewhat complexfranchise basis of the elections to the First Chamber before the passing of  the Bill.  Its-members were  elected by the County Councils as well as by the five towns of Stockholm,Gdteborg, Malmo, Norrkoping, and Gavle, which  are  not represented on the  CountyCouncils.  The composition of the First Chamber was consequently determined by theelectors to the  County and Municipal Councils, and it is  the  communal and county-franchise which has been drastically altered.  Under  the old system this franchise was.exercised on a scale of forty degrees, nicely calculated on a rate-paying basis.  Electorsin arrears with  their rates lost  their votes, and  bodies corporate, e.g., companies andcommunities, enjoyed the suffrage.  Women  had the vote under  the same conditions as-the men, the voting age being 21, subject, of course, to the rate-paying qualifications..To be eligible as a county councillor a man had to have attained his 25th year.    The following changes have now been made : General and equal communal franchiseis to  be exercised after completion of the 23rd year.   (Note that the communal andpolitical franchise age has now been brought to the same level.)  The right to vote  is notto be afteeted by the non-payment of rates, except in the case of those who are  in arrearsfor more than two out of  the three immediately preceding  years, and a wifes right to vote is not to  he affected by the fact of her husband having forfeited his right.   Withregard to the County Council  elections, the right to vote will be acquired by  theseentitled to vote in the communes but after the completion of the 27th year, and the san eage  constitutes  eligibility for  membership of  a County Council.   Constitutionalprovisions are  to be made with  regard to *the towns not represented on the  CountyCouncils for special electors, in accordance with the principles governing the election of      [752]-53
municipal councillors, but in the  meantime  voting will  be as  heretofore.    Bodiescorporate will lose their suffrage.     The period of duration of the First Chamber, now six years,  will become eight.     No one in Sweden pretends that they regard the changes introduced as in them-selves wholly satisfactory.  The fact is that, seriously disturbed at the signs of seriouslabour unrest of a revolutionary tendency of November of last year, the Liberal-SocialistGovernment hastened to take steps to break down Conservative  opposition  to first chamber reforms, opposition  to which had been up to then, during 1918, persistent and successful.  The Government put forward proposals and, the Conservatives vowing thatthey would  not yield another inch, counter-proposals.  The former were referred to thespecial Franchise Committee, and the eventual outcome was the  Bill  just passed, which represents a general retreat of the Conservatives  as regards  all  essentials.   It is,however, to some extent a compromise christened  the Swartz-Branting compromise,owing  to the  prominent  part  taken by  those two  prominent  statesmen,  the oneConservative and the other  Socialist, in  bringing about an  understanding.  Like  allcompromises, it satisfies no one completely not even the Government, who had proposed the retention of a rate-paying qualification,  in the  communes (equal but not  generalfranchise), but  the total abolition of disqualification in the event  of any arrears in ratesbeing due, and who certainly never contemplated that the age limit  for voters in theCounty Council elections would be  raised to  27  years one  of  the sops  given to the conservatives and one which has in some degree sweetened the pill to them.  Yet thereis a sigh of relief all over Sweden  that  the battle  roynl between the forces of con-servatism and democracy has not had  to be fought out to the  bitter end.  The  stateof unrest throughout Europe  and the downfall of Germany has brought  home to everySwede except the Bolshevik elements represented in the  Second  Chamber  by : the12 votos against the Bill the menace of Labour unrest, not to say Bolshevism, and theknowledge that this menace could only be averted by drastic steps in the direction of democratic reform.   The Conservatives, realising that a fight would mean their politicalruin,  virtually capitulated, and the  Liberal-Socialist Government, content to  get&apos; thesubstance of their desire, left  to their opponents the shadoAv of certain reservations whichwill certainly be swept away as soon as the new Riksdag (practically certain now of a democratic majority in both Chambers) chooses to take action.  The march of events inthose weeks  of the end of November and beginning of December was very rapid.   On the10th  November came the  news of the German  revolution.   The same day a working-men^ deputation  approached  the Prime Minister, and, laying stress on the demand for constitutional reforms, expressed the hope that the Government would take the  matter in hand.  On the 14th November the Governments first communique  on the subject was issued.  On the 23rd November the proposals of the Government  were placed before the Biksdag ;  on the 26th they were referred to the special Franchise Committee(the members of which were chosen on the 27th) which set to work on the 3rd December.On the 10th the Committee issued its proposals, and the Bill embodying them was passedby the Riksclag on the  17th December.   This was most expeditious work, &quot; but,&quot; as&quot; Social-Demokraten &quot; has put it, &quot; we live in revolutionary times.&quot;           -  .     Perhaps the best and truest explanation of the course of events in  Sweden duringthose weeks  is contained in the following extract from a  speech by M. Bran ting, in thecourse of a debate in the Second  Chamber on the 17th December, the day of the passingof the Bill :  &quot; During the extraordinary session there has been something new a more powerful surge  of the democratic wave, which already in the spring  of 1917 fired theimaginations of peoples showing that former conditions no longer obtain.  We live  atthis   moment   in  another world.   Instead  of consolidating  the  old  Powers theworld-war has claimed as victims those who  were responsible for it.   It is that whichhas brought us face to  face with  another  situation.   Looking now at  the Germanconsolidation, with the uprooting of all settled and cherished institutions, one  under-stands that in no country can the old order remain as before. &apos; If we had lagged behind,the Swedish nation  would  have experienced a feeling  of national humiliation.   Andthat is the reason why it was the right and duty of the  Swedish Government to  permit the Swedish  nation to take a  definite step in the direction of democratisation.&quot;
