Sir,             I beg to submit the following report  on  the  work  of the   Pood Production Department for the week ended 7th  January,  1919:-                   The Weather and Condition of Crops,             The weather has continued wet during  the past&quot;week and   field work has been at a standstill on all but  some  light land.             Autumn sown wheat generally looks  well,  but  in the south-   west of England, it has been, checked by the  heavy  rains.             Prom several districts reports have been received of the   bad condition of corn in the stacks whieh could not  be thatched   owing to the lack of skilled thatchers.          . .                 &quot; LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.            Work of Agricultural Executive Committees,   Surrey.  In April 1918 the dbmmittee were authorised to take   possession of 68 acres of land near Walton Downs which had been   used by the Epsom Grand Stand Association as a  gallop.  The land  was   let by the Committee and was successfully cultivated for food crops.   The Board have now authorised the Committee, at their request, to   take possession of a further 40 acres adjoining the  same land and   until recently used by the War Department in connection with an   adjacent Gas School.   This will be let to the  tenant of the adjoin-   ing land who will-cultivate it also with food crops.           ,  .,   Prosecutions. -  In Cornwall a farmer at Pelynt, part of whose farm   the Committee had been authorised to take possession of owing to  its   neglected, condition, has been fined  25 and   15. 15. 0. costs for   interfering with- the cultivation of that portion of  the farm after
possession had &quot;been taken by the Committee,    In Essex  a  farmer JCanvey Island has been fined  15 and  15.  15.  0, costs  for  fallujcomply with a cultivation order issued by  the  Committee,  and for similar offence a farmer at Southminster has been  fined  15 and &amp;costs.&apos;  In Wiltshire a farmer, at Somerford Keynes has  been fined!and  5. 5. 0. costs for failing to carry out the. orders of  theCommittee,   ...Determination of Tenancies.  During the week 5 Orders have  been irjby the Board determining tenancies on account&quot;  of bad farming in rfof 210 acres.                      1-  -    &quot; &quot;&apos;                HORTICULTURAL, DIVISION.provision of Land for Allotments.  The estimated number of  allot!provided under the Cultivation of Lands Orders up  to April  30th l]was 376/600&quot;        containing 31,000 acres.    Since that  date  4081ment Authorities have agreed to  acquire a  further  58,620  allotmentcontaining 4,507.          During the fortnight ending 4th  January,in addition tolland mentioned above 15 looal authorities have  Agreed  to acquire!allotments a total of 301 acres, equivalent to 2,C61^allotments,including 73 acres.at Bardney  (Llndsey).          At wilburtcn  (Isle of Ely) all the householders,  100 inlnumber, are cultivating gardens  attached to their  houses.  In  addi]QD% are cultivating allotments of about i  acre each.          Some 95% of the 415 householders at  Wo odour y  (Devon) hailkitchen gardens, and 2b% are cultivating an allotment of  23 poles.Fruit Section.   Good progress has been made  in Somerset with regarjto fruit pruning in orchards,&apos;  where the work  is  being carried  out under the supervision &apos;of the Horticultural Instructor for the  cowby soldiers who h*ve been trained in pruning.  Altogether 28 &quot;acreshave been finished and  24 acres  are now being worked  on.  ,applications !have been received, tov  the  pruning of a further  30 acres, &apos; The&quot;&apos;cosis about  1 per  acre.-&apos;
t ^rketlng.,Section.   The Manager  of  the  National Filling Factory at iayes has reported  that he  has  12 tons of  carrots,  2 tons of parsnips\ ind 10,000 cabbages for disposal  which were  all grown on the advice.0 if this Department, and the  Manager  has  been placed in touch with  suitable  buyers.  Small Live btock Section.   Reports show  that there  is very little   &quot;&quot;&quot;^ &apos;&apos;&quot; m *...................*.....&quot;f*3w*.....  difficulty now in obtaining  millers&apos;  offals  for rabbits,  and the  quality of the food is approaching pre-v.*ar standard.   Oases of Rabbit  Influenza are being investigated;  so far  as is known there is  no cure,  End preventive methods are  practically negligible.          At the Poultry Advisory Committee  meeting held on the 30th ult,J the Committee recommended the Ministry of  Food  to abandon the poultry  rationing scheme and to inform the public  in the Press of their decision.                        TECHNICAL DIVISION.  &apos; ,-.  Uti 11sation ^of... Straw.   The  work  on  the  fermentation of straw has been  pursued recently with special reference &quot;to the  produotion of material  resembling farmyard manure.   One of  the main results of the  investigations has been the  discovery that fermenting straw possesses a  pronounced and definite property  of fixing ammoniacal nitrogen  and  safeguarding it from loss.   In its  turn,  the nitrogen thus held  exercises a&apos;marked effect on the  further decomposition of the straw and  results&apos;in the formation of  material  that  is chemically and physically  similar- to farmyard manure.   The results  already obtained are  capable  of a number of practical applications.   It  appears possible, for -  Sample, to produce more farmyard manure with less  loss of nitrogen by  the use of dilute liquid urine, than  by  strong  urine,.    It has  also,  teen found practicable to produce a  standardised synthetic farmyardI manure by the use of straw,  together with  a  definite but  low .amount ofj^traneous nitrogen in the form of ammonia liquor,  ammonium carbonate,  ionium sulphate, or animal nitrogenous compounds.    The value of other forms of nitrogen is also being determined,  in  order to allow of the 1Jse of any low priced nitrogen products that  may come on  the market
from time to time.   The application  of  the  results  to work  on apractical 3cale  la now under consideration.Composltloh of Potatoes.    It has been deoided  to  continue the eismade last season into the food value  of  the  potato crop,  andarrangements have been made for  the analysis at various  institutiof a large number of samples of  potatoes drawn  from  different parthe country,Seed Testing Station. ,  During the year  1918 the number  of sampletested has been  14,569.   The total number of samples  received duthe first five months of the second seed testing season,  viz:-August 1st 1918  - December 31st  1918  amounts to 8,185.    Cerealscontributed largely to this total, 3,397 samples of  wheat and 784samples of oats having.been tested.   Peas and  vegetable  seeds arbeing received in far greater quantity than  last season.   161 sefirms have opened deposit accounts with  the  Station.   A  short statement is being prepared for  the February issue of  the Board!sJournal indicating the probable  quality  of the  seeds  that will beavailable for the current season.                          LABOUR DIVISION.Demobilisation.   The names of over 12,000 agriculturists have be forwarded to the Department of Demobilisation to date  for early release from the Colours as &quot;pivotal&quot; men in agriculture.   Only vfew of these men have so far been released,  and urgent  enquiries abeing received from the County Agricultural  Executive  Committees omatter.   It is most Important that all  these men  should  be  returnto their civil occupations during the next two  weeks,  and shouldbfollowed as quickly as possible  by the general  body  of  agrionlturinow with the Forces.m, 4 *&quot;
          The Department have arranged with the Ministry of labour that the Labour Sub-Committees of the Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees shall act as the Sub-Committees of the Local AdvisoryCommittees of the Employment Exchanges in matters relatingto the demobilisation of agriculturists and placing of civilianlabour in agriculture.   In order to secure complete co-operationbetween the Labour Sub-Committee and the Employment Department.the Ministry of Labour will appoint, where they consider itnecessary, an Officer of the Employment Exchange to act with theCounty Labour Officer as Joint Secretary of the Sub-Committee inconnection with the placing of civilian labour in agriculture,    TheLabour Sub-Committee will continue to act solely under thegeneral direction of the Agricultural Executive Committee.Soldier Labour.   /n irmy Council Instruction has now been issuedproviding that all agriculturists serving at home of whatevermedical category may be attached to Agricultural Companies, pendingthe issue of any general orders relating to demobilisation.  Atthe same time all men at present on agricultural furlough are toremain out Indefinitely until demobilised.   This course shouldmaterially assist farmers until general demobilisation has beencompleted.          The number of soldiers already made available for agriculture under these arrangements is 10,553, an inorease of1,215 over last week.                       Women1s Branch.          There are some 750 members of the Women&apos;s Land Armyunemployed, of whom between 70 and 80 are milkers, some with considerable experience.          Some time ago the fomen&apos;s Land Army of America invited&apos;representatives of the English Land Army to visit that country.Unfortunately, the stress of work here made It Impossible toaccept the invitation.   In regretting this, the General Secre^arty
of the Women&apos;a Lend Army of America //rites expressing  theircongratulations upon the achievements of the Land Army in  Britain food production, which they feel sure have materially helpedin bringing the war to its victorious conclusion.                    CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme.   The following statement sho^s the position wlregard to the machinery and implements owned by the department the week ended 4th January. 1919:-TractorsPloughs&apos;&quot;No consigned to counties during week.(7 withdrawn)Total No,   withcounties.   4,191   5,323                                   (8 withdrawn)          During the week ended 20th December, 6,3^7 acres were ploughed, 24 acres were cross-ploughed and 165 acres cultivated          A pattern of brake for Pordson tractors has been insand passed.   Brakes will be issued only to those counties withhilly land to deal with.          A demonstration of tractors and implements Is abouttcarried out in the North Riding of Yorkshire at which members oDistrict Committees of the Northern counties will be invHed topresent fHorse Soheme.   In accordance with the authority given by theDepartment for the sale of horses  surplus to their requirementshorses were sold during the past week.  Twenty-seven horses at newport, Mon., realised an average price of  61.Steam Tackle,   The,; acreage dealt with during the past week isfollows:- ploughed 1,002 acres,&apos; cultivated 721 acres. Total 1,acres.
                         SUPPLIES DIVISION.Basic Slag.  The demand for basic slag at the present time is verygreat, and the makers have far m^re orders in hand than they are able to execute at once.   As a result, a number of complaints arebeing received of delay in delivery, but makers are-delivering their output as fast as it is produced, and there  are practically nostocks in hand.  The general position is satisfactory, as the totaldeliveries have been about 16 per cent more  than they were in thesame period last year.  The production at some of the works duringthe past six weeks has suffered owing to the Christmas holidays and the stoppage of work during armistice week.Army Manure.   Deliveries from the Eelmoor Dump near Aldershotduring 1918 amounted to 14,500 tons in all,  of which 9,150 tons were delivered to Surrey and 5,350 tons to Hampshire.Seed Potatoes.  With a view to preventing the export of &quot;seed&quot;seriously affected with disease, and to safeguard the futureinterests of the export trade in seed potatoes, the Board aremaking arrangements to inspect all the consignments licensed forexport.Cereal Seeds.  Pending the official decision as to the removal ofcontrol on the export of Irish oats to England, no purchase of irish Black Tartarian seed oats has been made.  If the control on export from Ireland is removed, there will be no reason f^r theBoard tc undertake distribution this season.          The sanction of the Treasury has been obtained for thepurchase of 20,000 tons of seed oats for the French Government.Testing of Seeds Order.  It has been decided, as a result of representations made by the Seed Trade, to issue a General Licenceunder the Testing of Seeds Order fixing official standards ofgermination for the root seeds, etc. included in Part III of theFirst Schedule to the Order.  Germination standards have now been fixed for all seeds affected by the Order with the exception ofgrasses and clovers.
Canadian Wonder Beans *  The whole of the 535 bags of CanadlaWonder Beans placed at the disposal of the Department by theWheat Commission have been sold for seed purposes at asatisfactory price.                        I am.                             Sir,                                 Your obedient Servant.                                        Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P..
