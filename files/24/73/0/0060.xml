(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAflMIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).g S C R gG.T. 6660.        W A H   0 A B I 3Sf E T,      IRISH &apos; iERISOUSHStMemorandum &quot;by ivlr. Barnes.I am somewhat concerned about the above.   There are anumber of Sinn Eein Members of Parliament,  I supposenow in prison.    We are going&apos; to the Peace Conference,;%nd may bo prejudiced thereby,  moreover, anythingmight happen which would give a stimulus to Sinn; FeinisnuOne of them might die whilst in custody and there wouldbe an immediate hullaballoo abort it.  They  hsve beennow in prison for a long time.  Obviously they cannotbe imprisoned, indefinitely, and it seems to me thequestion of their liberation, although involving danger,might be the lesser of two evils now open to us,  Ifthey broke the law they could of course he put on trialafter liberation.   It is worth considering, of course,as to whether or not we should exact som*- sor&quot;t of guarantee,, but I merely put this brief memo: forward to record my concern in the matter.                           (Initialled)   G.N*Ba2 Whitehall Gardens, S,W6       16th January, 1919.
