(This Document is the Property of Hie Britannic Majesty18 government).SECRET/WAR  CABINET.TOMPLOYMg AJJD STATE FINANCIAL A381 STANCE               3*0 IIDUSm,           MiilMOHANDtM BY  THE MINISTER Off  LABOUR.         In view  of the  increasing amount  of unemployment,., the absence  of,any indication that  an early revival  of industry is to &apos; be expected, and the  prospect of  large numbers of discharged cerviee  men being  thrown  on  the omployment  markot in the course of the next twe  months, I wish  to draw the  War Cabinet&apos;s attention to the different position in whioh industry is plaoed owing to the incidence of high costs  and our present system of taxation.          I recognise  that thero is a large  body  of opinion which deprecates any step which might involve Government support of industry for an  indefinite period.    I believe,  however, that industrial and commercial opinion in this country would be practically unanimous in  favour of procedure on  the following lines, whioh was put  forward in Memoranda by Sir Stephsnson Kent on the &quot;14th December  and  the 4th  January, addressed to the War Cabinet  and Sir  Eric  Geddes  respeotivelyi-Wlb   i, Th&amp;t Seotion 40  (3) of the finance (No.2.) Aot, 1915,       be extended  so  as to applj  to special depreciation occurring       after tho  war in  the same way as It applies to special       depreciation during tho war.       2. That the  principle  of  the Section  so extended is fco apply       to Income  Tax in  the same way as to Sxcess Profits Duty.       3. Thax  the  taxpayer  should have the  right to carry forward       into subsequent accounting periods any allowance for special       depreciation which  cannot be met out  of the profits of       the current  period.       4,  That  the rate of JSxoess Profits Duty be reduced to       50$*       It is,  In my opinion,  necessary that the Government  should  recognise,  in the  first  place, that the trading  community  must make provision out of profits for the inevitable fall in  values  wiiioh will follow the present period cf high prices,  and                                                          /in
in the second, that no one-will embark on new ventures which,owing&apos; to tho operation of the Excess Profits Duty, hold out no prospect of substantial rjain.:i  I feel confident, however, thatif an authoritative pronouncement wore made on tho lines of theorecommendations a.long stop would have been taken.towardsrestoring confidence and reviving industry. .  In  view of thoresponsibility of my Department in the ,resettlement of labour,,I make no apology for bringing this subject to -.the attentionof the War gabinet.                                      -                     -fSgd)  R. 3.
