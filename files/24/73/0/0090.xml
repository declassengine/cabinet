SECRET SERVICE.UQ ft.T. 6690.MEHQRANDUM FOR THE  WAR CABINET BY TK        .  *    HOME SECRETARY.      I quite ugree with the .First Lord of. the Admiralty that the, question of the  Secret Service is of very great importance.                  ,  - /.,.&apos;.      So far as the Home Office., is concerned, the position is as follows.   There is  no actual Director of Seoret Service, but Mr. Basil Thomson,, who is Assistant  Commissioner at Scotland Yard,* is also head of the Criminal Investigation Depart-  ment.   The Criminal Investigation Department deals with crime generally, and in-  cludes one branch (the &quot;Special Branch&quot;) which has always dealt and still deals.  with matters relating to Fenianlsm, anarchism and political criminals generally.  Like the rest of the Metropolitan Police Force, its proper jurisdiction is the  Metropolitan Police District,  but incidentally its enquiries have extended to the  rest  of the country and, to some extent,  to foreign countries..  It remains^$however, part of the Metropolitan Polico  organisation and the cost is paid from  ordinary police funds.      Mr. Basil Thomson has also, on behalf  of the Ministry of Munitions, established  a special  branch for collecting  information as to Labour unrest and threatened  strikes and  disturbances.   The  expenses  of this branoh are paid from the secret  service  funds  of the Ministry of Munitions, and the information obtained is  distributed  in a daily bulletin  to all  the  Government Departments concerned.       The Home Office has also another agency, distinct altogether from  Scotland  Yard but  in  close  touch with  Mr&apos;, Thomson  personally, for  obtaining information  in&apos;  Irish matters  -  particularly  in  regard  to criminal conspiracies originating  in  America.    This  agency  is  kept entirely distinct from the Police, but the inform--  ation obtained is  communicated weekly to  the Metropolitan and  to the Irish Police  and any specially  urgent  information is communicated at  once.   This agency  is  paid  for from secret service  funds and  is under the direct control  of the Home Office,       I hardly understand what the  effect  of the proposals of the First  Lord  would  be.   It is not,  as I  understand it, suggested that the War Office and  Admiralty  Secret Services should be put under  the Director  of Sooret Service.   The main  point  I gather, is to have a Minister  without Portfolio, who would be charged with the  duty of receiving secret service reports  and taking  such action as  seems to  be   necessary,   I doubt whether such&apos; a  Minister oould do  anything without  interfering  with the responsibility of other Departments.   Take,  for instance,  the matter   mentioned in the second paragraph  of the  First Lord&apos;a- memorandum.    The proposed  Minister could hardly give directions  with regard to  the use  of military motor-cars   without interfering with the War Office.    Equally so with the daily reports made   with regard to Labour unrest!  they concern tho work  of 8 or  10  different Depart-   ments and they are communicated to oaoh of these  Departments.    No Minister other   than the heads of the Departments  concerned could know what should be  5one on them(   or could aooept responsibility with regard to the action.       Unfortunately, Mr. Basil Thomson is in Paris, and without his help I&quot; am hardly   yet sufficiently conversant with the details of the working of the present&apos;system
either to make suggestions myself cr t*) orltiaiKo those of others.    I am far fromsaying that full use is made of the present Secret Service.-   There is no doubtthat serious attempts aro being made to disseminate Bolshevist doctrines in thiscountry.   They are exceedingly dangerous,  requiring moflt oareful watching and strong anti-Bolshevist propaganda.     1 have not been long enough at the Home Offioe tt- be in a position either tooriticize or suggest.    1 am not sure that tho arrangements for the exchange of  -information rapidly are all that they might be, and my Irish experience taught meof how vital importance it is that informai&amp;nn colleotod by the Secret service should be given to the Departments or authorities concerned without delay.                                               E.S.23rd January,  1919.
