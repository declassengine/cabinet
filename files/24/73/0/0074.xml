    I must ask the urgent attention of the War Cabinet to the attached Keport thathas been presented to me by a Committee that I appointed under the chairmanship ofLieut.-General  Sir G.  M.  W.  Macdonogh, the Adjutant-General, to consider  theimmediate provision of the British Armies of Occupation required in the several theatres of war, and of the home and overseas garrisons.    The recommendations of the Committee in the final form in which they are now presented, have secured the general agreement of a full and representative conferenceheld by me at the War Office this morning, which included Sir Eric Geddes, Sir robert home, Sir Douglas Haig, Sir William Robertson, and Sir Henry Wilson.    This is unquestionably  the most pressing of the  problems with which the Govern-ment is faced, and immediate decisions are vital.    I also append a letter which I have received from Sir Auckland Geddes.                                                 WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.  17ih January, 1919.\ \ \
SECRET.Report of a  Committee on  Demobilization, Armies of Occupation                    and Home and Overseas Garrisons.         The Committee appointed  by the Secretary of State to consider the provision of Armies of     Occupation  and Home and  Overseas  garrisons submits the following recommendations  and    remarks:          1. All  men  enlisted since the 1st January, 1916, should be  held to serve subject to the    following exemptions:          (i.)  Compassionate (personal) cases and men with three or more wound stripes.         (ii.)  Those over 41 years  of age, according to date given in  their attestations  on attaining              that age.        (iii.)  Demobilizes and pivotal men,  other than those whose retention in the Army is essential              for demobilization  purposes.   The Ministry of Labour will forward names of those in              the retained classes by 1st February, and  agree  that the  total  number  of  pivotals,              whose release shall be demanded, shall not exceed 250,000 for the whole Army.  This              number will include those whose names have already been sent in,  and will  apply to              all categories of age and  enlistment and  not  merely  to  the men retained under the              Committee&apos;s proposals.        (iv.)  [Subjects of Allied countries and British subjects resident in the Dominions or in foreign              countries in the interest of the export trade.         The Committee considered the advisability of releasing Group 43 (students and teachers),    but  decided that as  it would be inadvisable to release students without releasing apprentices, and    as the latter were not included in any one industrial group, but would have to be sorted out fromf%  all, and besides that, as the release of students and  apprentices would destroy the graduated and    Young Soldiers&apos; Battalions which it is proposed should form the backbone of the Infantry of the    Army of Occupation in France, they, could not recommend their release.         2. The  Committee  estimate that by adopting the date suggested in paragraph 1, 1,727,000    men will  be made available before any  exemptions are made.  They further estimate that    approximately the following numbers will be required  for the Armies of Occupation, overseas and    home garrisons, viz.:                  Home.......,     ......    250,000                 France      ..     ..     ..     ..     ..     ..    650,000 (exclusive of Chinese).                 Other theatres and garrisons     .,     ..    - ..    250,000                             Total.......     ..     ..   1,150,000     These numbers are exclusive of those of the post bellum Army which must  necessarily be in process of formation during the  time the Armies of Occupation are retained, and will graduallyreplace some of the above.     There may consequently be a margin of about 600,000 men, against which the exemptions,possibly 300,000 men, will be debited.     3. The Committee are of opinion that the  figures before them are so approximate that itwould not be safe to work to  a  narrower margin to commence with, but they anticipate that,once the sorting out process has begun, it may  be possible to dispense with further  categories.Should this be the case, they would propose releasing in turn the higher age categories, i.e., first the men of 40, then those of 39, and so  on.  They are, however, met with the difficulty that ahigh percentage of the  administrative and transportation services consist of men of these higherage  categories, and that, though it may be found possible to replace these men  by civilians  to aconsiderable extent in Great Britain, it will not be practicable to do so in the Armies of Occupationor in Ireland, or in the overseas garrisons.     4. The Committee desire  to point out that  the retention of the categories mentioned inparagraph 1 will require legislative sanction beyond the statutory date fixed for the terminationof the war, and suggest that legislation should  be  asked from year to  year for prolonging theliability to service both of these men.and of Class Z Reserves,   They further consider  thatrecruiting under  the Military  Service Act  should be reopened so as to enable reliefs to becarried out.     5. The Committee  consider that their proposals for the retention of men  should form thebasis for the retention of officers  so far as  circumstances  will  permit.  These  proposals shouldsupply an ample number of  the junior ranks, 2nd Lieutenants  and Lieutenants, but practicallynone of the senior regimental or higher ranks.  Should volunteers of these ranks be insufficient,which is unlikely, the necessary numbers must  be held compulsorily.  They feel, however, thatreasonable financial terms should be offered.     6. The Committee consider  that  a  sufficiency of junior non-commissioned  officers will beprovided automatically by their proposals, and that a sufficiency of the  higher  warrant  and[A 210.3](B19/63)  100  1/ 9  II&amp;S  6766-two
non-commissioned ranks is  likely to be  obtained by volunteering&apos; if reasonable financial induce-ments are granted.  Powers should, however, be taken to retain temporarily  such warrant and non-commissioned officers as may be wanted.     7. The Committee  recommended that all men held under  their proposals should receivereasonable financial compensation.     8. The Committee propose that the 46 Graduated Battalions and 23 Young Soldier Battalionsnow in the United Kingdom should be sent to France as  soon as General Headquarters are readyto receive them.  They further  recommend that authority should be given to send boys under19 years of age to Armies of Occupation or garrisons in Europe.     9. The Committee consider that volunteers should  be accepted from those men who  aredemobilizable under  this scheme, and  that any  such  volunteers  should be  set  off againstrequirements, and consequently will produce a reduction in the upper limit of age for retention.     10. The Committee make the following minor recommendations:      (a.)  From  a fixed date, say the  1st  February, no  leave except on  urgent compassionate           grounds, should  be  given  to ary men  overseas other  tban  those excluded from           demobilization.     (b.)  Leave on as generous a scale as possible should be granted to those who are held.     (c.) The demobilization of  any man guilty of acts of insubordination should be postponed.     (f/.)  The demobilization of men  who are to be released should be according to priority of           industrial groups.     11. The Committee  consider that the scheme when approved by the War Cabinet  should become operative forthwith, so as to prevent the further demobilization of the retained classes.They would suggest that a full statement of the reasons for the adoption of this scheme shouldbe made publicly immediately before orders for  its execution are issued.  The representative ofthe Ministry of Labour thought, however, that the date  of bringing the proposals into operation should be postponed to 1st February.     12. The  Committee are of  opinion that all men forming part of the Armies of Occupation,Home and Overseas garrisons, should be  liable to general  service, except that boys under 20 years-of age should not be employed outside Europe.                                                        G. M.  W. MACDONOGH,                                                                       Adjutant-General.]lth January, 1911).
APPENDIX.                                                             15th January, 1919.MY DEAR CHURCHILL,    I have been studying the existing machinery for demobilizing the armies and have formed the  opinion  that it  is based on  wrong  principles, and that if it is allowed tocontinue to operate it will produce results deplorable alike in civil life  and in the forces.    I strongly urge that a sufficient number of  men  to form the transitional army orarmies of occupation, with their necessary services, be selected on some perfectly simpleprinciple, and that the  rest be demobilized as rapidly as possible.    Many alternative bases of selection of the transitional army will readily  suggestthemselves to you;  for example, all ,men  now  under 33 who joined the colours after1st January, 1916  (roughly the date of clear knowledge as to  the terms of the firstMilitary  Service Act), might be retained and all others be demobilized.  Those retainedshould, I think, either receive a bonus or increased pay.    The basis of selection decided on must, of course, be one which will allow sufficient numbers  of men to be  retained  for strict  military needs.  At present, 1 believe, the worst suspicions of  the  Army as to the vagaries  associated  with the word  &quot;pivotal&quot;have real foundation.  We have all heard of the fried fish salesman released as pivotaland of other doubtful cases.  I, myself, believe  that nhe country is far more in need ofthe return to it of a  fair sample of its manhood  than of any selective return.   It seemsto me impossible  to begin to get back  to normal  conditions  until  the  populationcomposition begins to  return  to  the normal.  In  other words, I am sure that this&quot; pivotal&quot;  theory  of demobilization is  fundamentally  unsound.  But  even  if it weresound in  theory, which I am  sure it is not, the staff required to work it does not existand cannot, so far as I  can see, be created.                                                        Yours sincerely,                                                               A.  C.  GEDDES.The Rt. Hon. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, M.P.
