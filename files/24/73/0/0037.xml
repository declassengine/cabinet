                   JThis :             i?  thfi Property of Col.W.Dally.  Jones                  JHia   -                           roment.)                  1 QQCirculated by the  Secretary of State for India.                                        10 JSECRET.-111.........&apos;(,13*/                                 HOUSING.     I desire to associate myself with the views expressed by Mr. Chamberlain on the rural Problem (G.T. G55G) as regards the acquisition of land.   The  State must havethe right, and  we shall, I think,  not make  much progress  without  it, to secure landfor national purposes,  whatever those purposes  may  he.   I  think also that it isimpossible to conceive of a scheme which does  not  limit the prices charged hy some such  arrangement as  Mr.  Chamberlain suggests.   The  prosperity of  agriculturerecently has led to a great inflation in the price of land, and it will  be impossible tosatisfy national purposes on any economic basis at these prices.     I am also  in agreement with him that  it is necessary to charge for cottages  aneconomic rent  on normal cost.  The difficulty is to make wages such  that an economicrent can be  charged.   It does  not seem  to me  that  we shall ever  settle  to  the satisfaction of  all parties what the wages  in agricultural districts should he unlesssomebody,  perhaps the  War  Agricultural  Executive  Committees, is  allowed  to conduct experiments  in  order to see, with careful  accountancy and book-keeping,what rate of wages the profits of  the industry in each locality can stand.     I agree further with Mr. Long  that one valuable way of increasing the provisionof working-class houses in country districts would be to ensure that  County Councils,District Councils, Railways and Post Office  Authorities find houses for their ownemployees.     I should like to add  that the provision of cottages is so  urgent that I can only hope that no further prolonged enquiries will be necessary before a start is made.  Itis not only a deficiency in numbers which has to be cured, it is that in many villages(I can only speak  of  those of  which I have experience) the  existing cottage  accom-modation  is simply  disgraceful.   The newspapers  have been  so preoccupied withother matters  that we have escaped much public reference to. the appalling ruralmortality from influenza.  One of the causes, making due allowances for the shortageof doctors and nurses, is, I do not hesitate to say, the lack of  resisting power amongthe  rural  population due to the insanitary  conditions in which they are compelled todwell, and the impossibility of escaping contagion  owing to the same cause.   Duringthe  recent winter coal has been very scarce, not only because of the restrictionsnecessitated by  the war, but because country  dealers, often through lack of businesscapacity, have been unable to  provide  their customers with the ration to  which theywere entitled.  Consequently hot  water  has been  an impossibility;  overcrowdedbedrooms in which influenza patients have  remained in bed because it was impossibleto  keep warm anywhere  else, have led to shocking results.  It is in Ike country districts a matter not only of  increasing  accommodation but  of  replacing accom-modation, and we are too late already.     In conclusion, I found during the recent election in many villages that there is  ademand for cottages (with some land attached, a quarter to half an acre)  which can be purchased  on  an instalment basis spread over  a term of  years.  I would suggest  thatit might be possible to provide for cottages on  this  plan as an item in the government bill.                                                                      E. S. M.     9th January 1919.10  SS.32  45  1/19
