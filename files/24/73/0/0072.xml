The street combats which were waged in Berlin on January $ttoand 7th and which appear to be still pr$ocea\&amp;ag on  the 12threpresent a fresh stage in the struggle between the followers of :Lichkneobt * the Spartacus group    and the reconstituted MajoritySocialist (government or Council of People1s Commissaries headed byBbert and fchei&amp;emanrw   The struggle resolves itself into a ocn*conflict between German Bolshevism encouraged by large subsidies from moscow (and also by the presence of the Russian Bolshevik, Radek,)and the vast majority of the  ettnan people who are behind thepresent Government*     $he Liebkneebt party consists mainly of working men and -deserters, who have gradually been armed and provided withmaobine-guns from the faotoaies at Spandau with the ^emplicityor rather the active assistance of Bicbbora, fclinaritv SocialistPresident of the Polite, a sympathiser with the Spartacus Group,The great building of the Police Presidency in the Alexander Plata, a street1s length to the east of the Spree ana the Reyal Castle, has ftr weeks past been converted into a Spartacus arsenal fromwhich arms were distributed to Liebknecbfs mtb whenever dis-turbanoes broke out.     The episodes of violence on December 23rd and of fighting on December 24th, .oritbe other hand, were no primarily or dir&amp;otly
                     ^the work of the sPa3rt&amp;ous group.   They arose from an attempt on&quot;She part of the GoTernment&quot;&apos;to^jjajd.produce  the sailors from.;^lh^^^harvenand Kiel who had taken part in tbe^riglisl Kerolution of KOT3ir.be r9th to evacuate their quarters in the Boyal Gastle,   The Ero&amp;siwiMinister of finance, Sdmoiij who had conducted an investigation:into the conduct of these sailors reported that there had been much Ifeting in the Castle and that valuables to the amount of several million marks had been abstracted,   Negotiationsopened with the sailors, who in sailorlike-d&amp;shion professed theQLrdesire to be on goed terms with everybody including the Governmentand their readiness to-evacuate the- Castle .^n^paymerit K^f^rrearsof pay which they claimed to the amount of about  4,000*   Theycalled themselves the P^people^-a MarinaJDiviaioa and wanted to beofficially recognised and embodied as a section of the newPopular Militia which was being mm titrated for-the protection,.of  the Government*   Mistakes appear to have been -committedon  both sides and on the side *f the sailors there have alsobeen breaches of faith, due to the divided^authority  of theirelected leaders.    On the  23rd a section  of them.established.themselves as a ^uard at the building called under the oldrig&amp;se the Imperial Chancellors Palace,  next, door $o theForeign Office in the Vilhelmstrasse.  Their first act was toplaoe the whole Government under arrest and to  cut off itstelephonic communications.  Troopsloyal -teethe -Government.were summoned from  Potsdam and for a time it  seemed  as ifthere would be street fighting in front of the  Chancellor&apos;spalace.  Ebert preserved his presence of  mind.  He came  out into the street, moutfted a motor^lorry, addressed  the sailors and induced them not only  to raise the blockade but  also  to promise to evaluate the Oastle at the other, end of Unter  denlinden.  It is not  oleer whether he at the- -aanwr-time- undertook
                       n.                                  hj rj eJ                      &quot;yr1                                 7&apos;.- . ^that- tho allege cl^rrears of pay should--be^forbh coming ormerely promised an investigation.      The Bailors thought that they were to get the arrears,hut they or some of their leaders were not minded to evacuatet;he Castle, until they had the cash in band,  They thereforehit upon the compromise of handing the Keys of the Castle ina casket to Ebert as an evidence of their  ood intentions,While this was being  done another body of them proceeded to the Hea&amp;iuarters of the Commandant of Berlin, a buildingsituated in Unter den Linden at the Castle end of that thorough fare and separated from the Castle by a narrow canal which  :S$forms a loop of the Spree.   It was the Commandant of Berlin,a Sooialist soldier nam&amp;&amp; Wels, who had the military pay-boxunder his control and from whom the sailors hoped to receivethe alleged arrears.  !.els refused to pay out the money untilthe Castle should have been evacuated.  It was in vain thatthe sailors assured him that the Keys had been placed inEbert*s hands, %Q1B said that he must stick to his orders.The dispute ended in the capture of Wels by the sailors whoconveyed him with his immediate subordinate (now his successor)a Lieutenant Fisher, to the Royal Stables in the Square(Schlossplatz) opposite the Ccstle, where they kept him in custody all night.       Ebert, Scheidemann and Lhk;dsberg, the three MajoritySocialist members of the Government, spent the night in theImperial Chancellors Palace and kept up negotiations by telephone with the sailors in the Royal Castle&apos;and the RoyalStables.   About 1 a.m. one of the sailors1 leaders, appareht-ly more friendly than the rest, telephoned to Ebert that becould no longer be responsible for Weils1 personal safety.Ebert, with the consent of his Majority &quot;Socialist colleagues.
 thereupon telephone! to Potsdam that it would he neoeSia&amp;ry to- send troo-o into Berlin for the purpose of liberating Wels and securing the evacuation of the Castle.  Tbe troops, mainly Ullansy armed with amobine-guns and some pieces of field artillery, arrived in the course of the ni ht under the Command of a General Lequis.  The General on the morning of the 24th summoned the sailors to yield, -Iving them 10 minutes to evacuate the Castle.  His summons was not complied with and hostilities were opened, the sailors who had no artillery, replying to the attack by machine-gun fire from tbe windows of the Castle and the stables.  The artillery was finally brought u - and the Castle and the Stables were shelled with considerable damage to both.  Under cover of tbe artillery fire the troops rushed the Castle inside which some further fighting took v?.ace.   Finally an armistice of an hour was arranged and the sailors came down into the Square and&apos; began to-negotiate With General LeqUis for the evacuation of the Castle.  They disclaimed all hostility to the Government which they would prefer to defend as members of the Militia Guard, and they again undertook to evacuate the Castle.     According to a statement subsequently made to the Press by General Lequis it was at this sta^e that the Spartacus party intervened with results which he regards as deplorable, Under the influence of the Spartaous Group iiichhorn thePresident of Police began to arm numbers of workmen at thePolice Presidency and instructed them to proceed to the Castle Square and join the sailors.   This was done, and, moreover, the workmen took women and children with them.  As Ge-general  Le ,.this states his troops could not resume hostilities when they would have had to fire upon women and children.  There seems to have been some kind of fraternisation with the
procrpe who, apart froq( this, had been showing a tendency tomelt away.  The measures of armed coercion were at an end,and the sailors quietly continued their occupation cf theRoyal Castle, which they did not finally evacuate tillDecember 31,          1     The anomaly of the  situation was further accentuated bythe fact that the sailors, true to their conception of their role as authors and defenders    the Revolution, have once&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;                                                 $more declared themselves to be supporters of the Ebert Government,   They7have deposed some of their elected leaders whohad presumably been in touch with tbe Spartacus group and during the late conflicts which began on January 6th theyhave bean, passively at any rate, on the Government side,&quot;/hat they really want is doubtless employment in berlin and pay.     T!his particular situation is reprodusedciin variouscentres throughout Germany, in Hamburg for instance, wheredemobilised soldiers and sailors prefer the position and pay of members of the popular Guard with its opportunities ofblackmailing and looting to any honest work that may be offerthem.  In Brxu3&amp;iick the revolutionary Government has beenoverthrown by people &amp;f this sort and in Bremen the extremesection of the working classes hafi been systematically armed.while a leyal regiment returning from the front was trappedby the show of a public welcome and summarily disarmed.
