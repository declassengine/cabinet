Germans        ...........  %\ 500? 000       &quot;3           Magyars,  Ruthenee,             and others   .........    500,000       tT (of these                                               over 400,000 are                                               Ruthenes&apos;f.         Although Dr.,Benes  claims that  the  new frontier is    based on  ethnological considerations,,  it is evidentJ:rom  the    above figures that a large- alien population is affected^         The  treatment which it is proposed  to  accord    to  the  different, races-varies  with their numbers;  e.go  -    the compact  block of Germans in  North-Western Bohemia is  to    be  given  a form of autonomy, provided that  allegiance  is    sworn to  the  new Ozecho-Slovak State.    Dr,  Benes  in his    pamphlet  on  the  Germans  in Czechoslovakia  states  that  their    numbers have  been greatly  exaggerated by past faking of the    census  returns,, but  he admits  the  presence  of 1\ 700,000    Germans in Bohemia;  these  he  describes as colonists whose    real interests would best  be  served by their  becoming    subjects  of  the  Czech Republic.         The  Ruthenes will not  bo  included in the new  State    without their own consent;  how the general  feeling  of this    population is to  bo  consulted  is  not  explained.         The  Magyars  are,  in theory,  to be allowed to manage    their own affairs, but,  in  view  of the fact that they are    widoly  scattered,  this will be difficult  to put into  practice.         That  certain small  minorities will  suffer seems    undoubted,  .  Men  belonging  to  the  old Czech nobility will    be  obliged to  soli their estates  at a valuation to  be fixed    by  tho Gzecho-Slovak Government;  they will bo  deprived  of    all citizenship and,  if  they fix  their residence in the now    State., they will  be  treated as strangerso   Dr, Bones advances    tho  almost incredible proposition  that there  are no   Jews    within the limits  of  the proposed  Ozocho-Slovak frontier,    possibly  this  statement  is  anticipatory of what will be the    fate  of the Jews  when the now Government has  had time to&apos;    exercise  its powers*
 3-  Religion*^        According to Dr, Benes, the religions question does not    play an important part in the settlement of the new frontier.    He claims that the Czechs were forcibly converted to Catholicism    some centuries back,  and that they now display indifference    in regard to religious questions,   The Germans and tho Ruthenes    will enjoy absolute religious freedom, 4 c  Boonomi o^Considerations a         The proposed frontier sacrifices Ethnological to Eoonomio    considerations in several cases,  cc,g0 - Worth-Western Bohemia    is a rich industrial area,  without which the new State would    be shorn of half its potential wealth; but the population    is undoubtedly largely German,   Again, the area shown as    &quot;at present occupied by Polos but claimed, by Czechs&quot;1,  and tho    region round ODBSBUSG,  contain coal mines and are inhabited    by a mixed population of  Czechs,  Germans,  Poles and  Magyars;    lastly,  the area inhabitod by Ruthenos is wanted by the new    Czechoslovak State on economic  grounds owing to the fact that    it would give a conterminous frontier with the new Greater    Roumania,  and thereby provide access to the Roumanian Rail-    ways,  the  Danube,  and the Black  Sea, 5*   Military Cons idsration         The&quot;&apos;North-&apos;-ostem frontier  of Bohemia is a good illustra-    tion of  the combination of military and economic considerations    in fixing  a frontier.   The  frontier line,  as traced,  follows    the crests of the Bohemian mountains,  which form a strong    natural  obstacle from a military  point of viow0   Consequently,    tho inclusion of 3-  million Germans in the new Czechp-Slovak    State  will get the support  of the military advisers of the    Czecho-Slovak Government  as  well  as that  of the  economic    experts3         In  regard to that part&apos; of the  proposed Czecho-Slovak    Republic which is inhabited by Ruthenes,  dr  Benes advances    the following argument    Ethnologieaily  this area should    form part  of Galicia  but,  since,  in Dr. Benes1 opinion,  the    whole  of Galicia will,  sooner or  later, be  absorbed by a future    Russian  State whose wealth and military resources will be in    proportion to its population,  Dr. Benes considers it would    be dangerous for such a State to  have an  outpost South of the    Carpathians,    The Magyar claim to  this area Dr* Benes dis-    misses on  ethnological and historical grounds and concludes    that the  only remaining alternative is for it to become part    of the Czecho-Slovak  Republic, ^ Neighbouring states.         The  attached tracing shows  in Blue Black the extent of    the territorial claims of the xolish National Council,  which    include  practically the whole of  Galicia,  Grodno and Volhynia,,    Dr0 Benes  describes this  suggestion as impossible of realisation,    for the  reason that  galicia,  Grodno and Volhynia must  eventually    he absorbed by Russia,  and that,  consequently, any Poland    conceited on such lines would be  an unstable State and a danger    to its neighbours,,   Dr*  Benes will not oppose Polish claims    in person, as he wishes to maintain friendly relations with&apos;-    the Poles., but ho will undoubtedly exercise all his powers    of intrigue/                                                             to                                 - 2  -
to prevent the realisation of the full aspirations ofthe Polish National Council.  The reasons for Poland&apos;8claims will he dealt with in, a separate paper.  It is sufficient at this stage to summarise them by saying thatthe claim to Gaiicia is &quot;based on the desire (-shared &quot;by the czecho-Slovaks) to have a co-terminous-frontier with Gr*&amp;aterRoumania.       In regard to the new Yugo-Slav State, Dr. Benesanticipates no special difficulties.   He will, apparently,Support the Yugc-Slavs in claiming that portion of theBANAT which lies immediately North of BELGRADE, and isshown on the tracing by a line in brown.       In regard to Hungary, Dr. Benes states thatfriendly relations could be established with the newHungarian Government if Hungary were shut off from GermanAustria by a belt of territory inhabited by Czecho-Slovaksand Yugo-Slavs;  he therefore suggests the somewhatartificial arrangement shown on the tracing, under which,between  AGRAM and PRESSBURG, there would be a belt of territory whose original Czecho-Slovak and Yugo-SlavStates, while, presumably, any undesirable elements ofthe former population would be expelled.       In regard to R-umania.   %ile, for obvious reasons, Dr. Benes wishes to be on good terms withRouinania, he considers that the frontier claimed by thatcountry in Hungary is excessive, and should follow theline Bhown in purple on the tracing.   He will undoubtedlygive his support to Roumanian claims in Bukovina, but with a view to satisfying Hungary and the Yugo-Slavs,will oppose the inclusion of the left bank of the THEISSin Roumanian territory.       Dr. Benes is prepared for a hostile attitudeen the part of Germany and Austria.   It is for thisreason that he considers a  strong natural militaryfrontier indispensable.   It is perhaps unfortunate  thatthis military frontier should so closely ooincidewith an economic frontier,  dictated by  selfish  interestsin defiance of all ethnological  considerations.Military Organisation of the new Czecho-Slovak State       The military forces at the disposal of the newCzecho-Slovak Government consist of        aj  The National Guard.....-------   50,000        bj  Army in Russia............100,000        c)  Czecho-Slovak Division               in Italy..................-   20,000       (d)  Czecho-Slovak Division               in Prance-------------------    7,000       (a) has no ammunition, guns or uniforms.  Allthese will have to be supplied by the Allies.       (b), (c) and (d) will have to be repatriated bythe Allies.       It is evident, therefore, that if the AlliesBupport Dr. Benes&apos; claims &quot;in toto&quot;, a very considerableamount of transport will have to be provided, and themaintenance and equipment of the Czecho-Slovak Army willhave to be taken over for an indefinite period.       Although no imme&amp;iate prospect of warfare on alarge scale in new Czecho-Slovakia exists, it would seeminevitable
      inevitable  that  hostilities  will  &quot;break  out  between  the      Czecho-Slovaks and the  Hungarians for the possession  of      that portion of  Czeoho-Slovakia marked  on the map as  &quot;not      occupied by Czechs&quot;.    Recent  reports show  the,&quot;  the      occupation  of such places ap REICHENBERG, TRENTSCHIN, etc,      is not being effected without  opposition.    This opposition      will become more serious  when  the Hungarians have      re-establishod some form  of  military organisation.8.    General.             Dr,  Benes is aiming at  the establishment  of      a State without  access  to the  sea;    he recognises  all      the difficulties from an  economic and industrial point      of view, and by  far the moot interesting featuie of his      programme is that part  of it which refers to the      internationalisatioh of railways  and waterways.  Dr.  Benes      considers that peace can  only  be  established in  Central      Europe by the application of entirely new principles  to      the question of  communications.    He wishes to internation-      alise the railway from  PRSSSBURG  to TRIESTE, also the      railways leading through  Roumania to the Danube  and Black      Sea, while  he insists that the Danube from  LINZ  or  Passau      should be an internationalised waterway, as it has  been      in the past from  Orsova  down  to  its mouths.  He  olaims      that by internationalising these  railways and the Danube,      it will be  possible to  constitute a group of &quot;Danubian      States&quot;, each having a  population of between 12  and l6      millions, independent of  each other politically  but      mutually interdependent from an economic and industrial      point of view.9*    Conclusions.             where so many varied and conflicting claims are      being pressed, it is impossible, at this stage,  to fore-      cast what will BD tno frontiers of this new Btate.  There      are, however, indications that Borne attempt at a    *-  &quot;rapprochement&quot; is being made between the Poles and Czecho-      Slovaks.   If the spirit of conciliation could be still      further extended, i.e. if Poles, Czecho-Slovaks,      Hungarians, Yugo-Slava an$ Roumanians could be brought      together at the approaching Peace Conference, and be induced      by the Great PowerB to discuss frontier questions amicably      with one another, it is certain that an agreement, so      reached by them, would &quot;fee far more fruitful of good results      than one imposed by the Great Powers, who can only know at      second-hand all the ethnological, eoonomic and military      complications of the situation.             Whether the Hungarians and Germans will he placed      in a separate category as &quot;vanquished peoples&quot; is not yet      quite claBf.   Dr. Bonos is optimistic about reaching an      understanding with the Hungarians if his plan of shutting      thorn off from Gorman influence is accepted, while, if      the report is correct that a Commercial Convention haa      &quot;been concluded between the Czech Republic and the Bavarians,      many of the economic difficulties in connection with the      delimitation of this part of th* frontier disappear.
