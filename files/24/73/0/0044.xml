tocAment is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.Printed for the War Cabinet.  January  1919.SECRET.    I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a  report of  an Inter-Departmental Committeewhich met at the Foreign Office to consider proposals for dealing with the question ofRussian prisoners of war in enemy countries.   \ The War Office state their case  for a comprehensive scheme, while the Treasuryenumerate the objections.    The decisions arrived at by the Committee are  as follows, the Treasury dissentingfrom No. 3 :     1. That having regard to the fact that one of  the main objects for dealing withthe Russian prisoners of  war was to  prevent, as  far as possible, avoidable accretionsto the Bolshevik military forces, and  to give  the stable  elements&apos;among the  russian prisoners of war in G-ermany an opportunity of avoiding incorporation in and resistingthe Bolshevik forces in Russia, no useful purpose would  be served by the adoption ofany scheme by the Allied Governments which did not provide reasonable safeguards for the achievement of this object.    2. That consequently the scheme which had been submitted by M. Frick, Swissdelegate of the International  Red Cross, should not  be adopted as the basis  for a comprehensive scheme, and that the request  of the French Government  to  advance to M.  Frick a sum  equivalent to the 500,000 fr. which had been  advanced by theFrench  Government  to provide  temporary relief pending  the elaboration of a more comprehensive scheme  should not be  complied with.    3. That the alternative proposals which had been put  forward  by the War Officeseemed  to provide the required safeguards.    4. Before however putting forward these proposals as a basis for discussion withthe Allied Governments, due consideration should be given (a) to their  relation  to thewhole question of the  Allied  Governments&apos; attitude towards  Bolshevik government;(6) to the question of the great expense which they would necessarily involve,  quite apart from the difficulty of food supply and  shipping ;  and (c) to the possibility thatthose elements in Russia to which the Allied Governments are at present lending their support may succumb to the Bolshevik forces.    It will be seen that the  result is to  raise the  question of our  attitude  towardsBolshevik Russia; and, so far  as I can gather, the general  opinion is that there wouldbe no justification for embarking on a scheme of such obvious magnitude as dealingwith the enormous numbers  of Russian  prisoners  in  Germany involves, unless  it isconsidered that some political advantage can be secured by doing so.    I should be glad if the Cabinet  would  give the matter their early consideration,as the French Government are pressing us for a decision.    If an independent  scheme is not to  be adopted, there remains the  question of relief.   The  conditions of the Russian  prisoners  of  war in  Germany are  reportedto us on all hands  as appalling, and J  imagine  the Allied Governments will wishto extend to them the same privileges as  they may decide to extend to other sufferingcommunities.  In that event, the best course seems to me to be to refer the  question to the authorities  who are dealing with the subject  of relief for Central  Europe, andespecially the revictualling of the enemy countries, leaving it to them to secure suchsafeguards as they may consider possible.

RUSSIAN  PRISONERS  OF  WAR.    AN Inter-Departmental  Conference was  held at  the Foreign  Office  on  the31st December to consider the question of dealing with the Russian prisoners of war inGermany.  The following were present:     Brigadier-General Bartholomew, C.M.G.,  D.S.O.,  Deputy  Director  of  Military         Intelligence, War Office.    Major Skaife, War Office.    Mr. Dudley Ward, Treasury.    Mr. Faulkner, Ministry of Shipping.    Mr. Secretan, Ministry of Shipping.    Mr. F. C. Greene, Ministry of Food.    Miss Nettleford, Ministry of Food.    Mr. 0&apos;Reilly, Prisoners of War Department.    Mr. Gregory, Foreign Office.    Mr. Selby, Foreign Office.    Mr. Gregory pointed out that the Committee had  before them the proposal ofM.  Frick, Swiss delegate of the International Red  Cross, for dealing with the problem.The French  Government had  already advanced  to  M. Frick the sum  of 500,000 fr. forthe purpose  of providing temporary relief, and had  asked His Majesty&apos;s Government tocontribute a similar sum and to  submit proposals for a  comprehensive  scheme.  TheCommittee had been called  together for the purpose of recommending the course whichshould be pursued by  His Majesty&apos;s Government in the circumstances.    Brigadier-General Bartholomew said that the draft proposals which he had broughtwith him were suggested  for discussion by the Committee.  In drawing  up this paper*it had been assumed  that  in  dealing with Russian prisoners of  war one of the mainobjects was  to provide safeguards against the invasion of Europe  and  Siberia by theBolshevik armies, and  that any scheme eventually adopted should aim at achieving thefollowing results:     1. To prevent  those elements among the prisoners in Germany which make fororder  from coming into the power of the forces of the Soviet Government which are theforces of disorder, and  from  being killed or imprisoned or unwillingly forced to take partin the spreading of the Bolshevik rule.    - 2. The  influencing of  those elements among  the Russian prisoners of war whichmight be looked upon as neutral, with the object of producing from them law-abidingcitizens of a future regenerated Russia.    3. The  introduction of the law-abiding elements  into those parts of Russia where their  influence would  be  most felt, taking into consideration the districts from whichthe particular prisoners originated and their own desires on the subject.    Genera! Bartholomew said that after careful examination of M. Frick&apos;s scheme theWar  Office  did  not consider it would be likely to achieve the objects which the WarOffice  had  enumerated.  -Many  of  the  centres from which  M.  Frick proposed  to operate had already been overrun by the Bolshevik  forces, and  although M. Frickcontemplated  the setting up  of  a cordon to prevent Russian prisoners of war  frompenetrating into Bolshevik  Russia, it did not  seem to the War Office that it would  belikely to achieve  the results  which  he assumed  His Majesty&apos;s Government  hadin view.    He was therefore of  opinion that  M. Frick&apos;s  scheme should  not be accepted as  final, and  that  even, were His Majesty&apos;s Government to consent to respond to the invitation of the French Government  to allocate to him a sum equivalent  to  the500,000 fr. allocated by the French Government,  they should  make  such an  advancesubject to the conditions  the War Office had put forward as  a  basis for a definitescheme.  The scheme which was suggested by the  War Office was as follows :-    1.  That there  should  be  a small Allied Executive  composed of representatives ofthe different  Powers  providing  the  money or food, which  should meet originally at      ,,                             * Annexed.
  Paris, and should then transfer its headquarters to Berlin or some other suitable centre  in the enemy&apos;s territory.      2. That the Russian prisoners of war should as far as possible be withdrawn  from  the working commandos, and especially from all commandos where they are engaged on  heavy or dangerous work, and placed in concentration camps the latter being grouped  or control,   (It would probably be  convenient to  take the original  German army  corps  districts  for this purpose, as  this would facilitate co-operation with  the German  authorities.)      That  in each  district  and in each  concentration camp there  should  be Allied  representatives responsible for the welfare of the  prisoners in their district,  but that the  administration of the camps  and districts  should be  in  the hands of the German  authorities,  who  should be made  responsible for  measures of security  and for the  maintenance of discipline, the duty of the Allied representative being (a) to ensure that  the treatment of the Russian prisoners of war is in consonance with the ideas prevailing  in,  for example, Great Britain, on this subject; (b)  to  ensure  that food  and other  supplies sent to the districts  and  camps from  Allied and other sources are made the  best use of for the  benefit of the  prisoners;  and (c) to initiate forms of mental  and  moral treatment which  will tend to encourage in the minds of the prisoners a desire and  respect for law, order, and established government.      3. That when this preliminary condition of affairs has been brought about, arrange-  ments should  be  made  for removing from such camps such elements  as may show  themselves definitely to be on  the  side of disorder and to be influencing their  fellow-  prisoners in this direction.  On the  contrary, that those elements who show themselves  favourably disposed towards the above principles  should be drafted to definite localities  with a view to speedy transfer, as  shipping or  railway facilities may permit, to  such  parts  of the  former Russian  Empire  which are out  of the dominion of the Soviet  Government.  It might perhaps be convenient for these elements to be concentrated in  localities within the -military occupation of the  Allied Powers,  but this  point is not  essential provided the localities chosen are removed from any possibility of coming into  the power of the Bolsheviks.      General Bartholomew emphasised the fact that the War Office fully realised  that  the work of carrying out the*poljcy they had outlined was one of great magnitude, and  would probably involve the expenditure of considerable sums of  money.  The support  of this country, as well  as of the peoples of  the other Allied countries  which might&apos;  participate in the scheme, would, therefore, be necessary in  advance.      The War Office representatives  said that one of the guiding ideas in drafting the&apos;  proposals had heen to throw a large  part of the  burden of working it on the shoulders  of  the German authorities who  should be  glad of  assistance  in  dealing with  this  immense work.      Mr. Dudley Ward said that he  agreed generally with the observations of General  Bartholomew  as  regards  M.  Frick&apos;s  scheme.   The  scheme seemed  to  him to be  altogether toe-vague; and  although M. Frick had mentioned the sum of 25 fr. per  head as likely to be sufficient for the purpose of affording relief, no indications had been  given as to the period which M. Frick  intended  to cover, and it was unlikely in any  case  that the scheme would offer any  safeguards for achieving  the results which the  War Office stated were  the principal justification for  embarking on  a scheme of such  magnitude.  Mr. Dudley Ward thought that any decision in regard to the question of  Russian prisoners of war in  Germany must necessarily be dependent on the attitude to  be  adopted  by the  Allied Governments  towards Bolshevik Russia.  If the Allied  Governments took upon themselves to  deal with the question of Russian prisoners of  war on the lines suggested by the  War Office, they would inevitably take upon them-  selves the  functions which properly belonged to the  Russian Government, and  they ,  must be prepared to face the inevitable consequences.      A further objection was that the  War Office proposal  gave  little  promise of the  successful  combating of Bolshevism.   There was no guarantee that prisoners,  after  having been  fed and clothed by us, would not become Bolshevik at once on their  return  to Russia.   Indeed, experience  suggests that this would be extremely probable.  At  the most we should, by  maintaining  these&apos; prisoners in  concentration camps, be to  this  extent reducing possible reinforcements to the Bolshevik armies, although in his opinion  these prisoners, if  enlisted in large numbers, would weaken  rather than strengthen the  Bolshevik forces, as they would certainly be very  disinclined to take the offensive again  after four years&apos; experience  of war and imprisonment.      As regards expense, the cost of maintaining in idleness  or shipping back to Russia
upwards of one  million men  would be  obviously  enormous, and he  was unable torecommend that such a  proposal, particularly in view of  the uncertainty of any satis-factory results, should be submitted by His Majestys Government to the  Allied Govern-ments.  He agreed that the problem  was almost insoluble.  The only suggestion hecould make was that the German Government should be allowed to retain such prisonersas were willing to stay to be used  on productive work in Germany under  satisfactoryconditions of pay and maintenance.     Mr. Faulkner (Ministry of Shipping) observed that if the War Office contemplated the transport of certain  numbers of Russians by sea to the part of Russia to which theymight wish to go, he thought lie should point out on  behalf of the Ministry of Shippingthat, if the numbers involved were likely  to  be in any way considerable, there was no prospect of shipping facilities being available for at least twelve months.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must therefore contemplate  the probability of having to  maintain suchprisoners as might be brought into concentration camps in Germany or  elsewhere for avery considerable time.     Miss Nettlefold said that, as far  as the Ministry of Food were concerned, theywould be very reluctant to assume any additional responsibility as  regards  largenumbers of Russian prisoners of war.     The War Office representatives pointed out.that if it  were intended to supply food for the population  of  Germany, there would appear to be no difficulty in insisting thatthe  Russian prisoners of war;  as  being persons who had fought  in the Allied cause,should benefit first, and in enforcing this by intimating that failure to co-operate would adversely affect the supply of food to the German population.     Mr. Gregory said that  it was quite obvious that from  the  discussion which hadtaken place the question of Russian prisoners of war in Germany was too much  involved with that of the general policy of the Allies as regards Bolshevik Russia to enable adecision to be  come to independently of the large question of policy. At the same time,he would like  to point out that  as regards Mr. Dudley Ward&apos;s criticism, that the adop-tion of  the War Office scheme would mean that the Allies would  unjustifiably assume the functions of the Soviet Government; that the so-called Russian prisoners of war inGermany comprised great numbers of the subjects of the new Eastern States, who were unable to help themselves, and  would gladly welcome our action, while  the number ofthe adherents of the Soviet Government were unknown.     The Committee agreed :      1.  That having regard to the  fact that one of the main objects for dealing with theRussian prisoners of war was  to prevent, so far as possible, avoidable accretions to theBolshevik military forces, and  to give the stable elements among the Russian prisonersof  war in  Germany an opportunity of avoiding incorporation in and resisting theBolshevik forces in Russia, no useful purpose would  be served by the adoption of any scheme by the Allied  Governments which did not provide reasonable safeguards for the achievement of this object.     2.  That consequently, the scheme  which had been submitted by M. Frick, Swissdelegate of the International  Red  Cross, should not be adopted as the basis  for a comprehensive scheme, and that the request of the  French Government to advance toM.  Frick a sum  equivalent to the 500,000 fr. which  had  been  advanced  by theFrench Government to provide temporary relief pending the elaboration  of a more com-prehensive scheme should not be complied with.     3.  That  the  alternative proposals which had  been put forward by  the War Officeseemed to provide the required safeguards.*     4.  Before, however, putting forward  these proposals as a basis for  discussion withthe Allied Governments, due consideration  should be given (a) to their relation to thewhole question of the  Allied Governments&apos; attitude towards Bolshevik government;(b) to the question of  the  great  expense which they would  necessarily involve, quite apart from the difficulty of food supply and shipping;  and (c) to the  possibility thatthose elements in Russia to which the Allied Governments are at present lending their support may succumb to the Bolshevik forces.     December 31, 1918.* Mr. Dudley Ward, on behalf of the Treasury, did not agree to this recommendation. W.H.S., 4.1.19.
  CONSIDERATION OF THE QUESTION OF THE RUSSIAN PRISONERS OF WAR IN GERMANY,            AND  M. FRICK&apos;S PROPOSALS FOR  DEALING WITH THIS QUESTION.  ,      In this paper it is presumed that the policy to be followed in dealing with Russian  prisoners of war in Germany should aim at achieving the following results :       1.  To prevent those elements among these  prisoners which  make for  order from  coming into the power  of the forces of the Soviet Government, which are the forces of  disorder, and from being killed or imprisoned, or unwillingly forced to take  part in the  spreading of Bolshevik rule.      2.  The influencing of those elements  amongst the  Russian  prisoners of war who  may be looked  upon as neutral, with  the object of producing from them  law-abiding  citizens of a future regenerated Russia.      3.  The introduction of the law-abiding elements into those  parts of Russia where their influence would be most  felt, taking into consideration the districts from which the particular prisoners originate and their own desires on the subject.      In  addition,  before considering  M. Frick&apos;s  proposal  in  detail  or  offering an alternative plan, it must be premised that  the work of carrying out the policy outlined above is one of great magnitude, and involves the expenditure of a considerable amount of money.   It is, therefore, most important that any scheme which may be adopted should  be  one which will have the  support of this country, as also of the peoples of the other Allied countries which may participate  in the scheme.      It is necessary to  point out that  mere  relief by means of money grants  or by provision of food will be of little avail unless  it is combined with  a much fuller scheme aiming at the moral influencing of the Russian prisoners of war under consideration, and with provisos which Mall ensure that, so far as the German authorities are  concerned, the scheme proposed by the Allied  Governments is really carried out,     So far as can be judged from a consideration of M. Frick&apos;s plan, he seems to have in view the relief of the Russian prisoners of war from the point of view of adequate feeding and medical attendance.  He certainly, however, contemplates the transporting of such prisoners of war  who belong to parts of Russia other than those at present under the  Soviet dominion  to their real homes, but  his scheme, which  was propounded some considerable time ago, has lost a great deal of its value from the rapid change of the situation in  the  Western portions  of the  former Russian Empire.  There are certain factors of the actual situation whioh press for  attention, viz.:      1.  The Soviet  forces are rapidly advancing&apos; westward, and have already overrun a large part of Esthonia, as well as certain parts of Latvia  and Lithuania, and Poland is distinctly threatened by them.     2.  A large part of the Ukraine is now in the hands  of the  Directorate of Petlura and  Vinnichenko.  This Directorate, although at  present  not  allied  to the Soviet Government, appears to be extremely suspicious of any designs on  the part of the Allies toward control of the Ukraine, and would  probably  put obstacles in the way of any withdrawal of foodstuffs from  the  Ukraine or of the establishment of Allied control stations in  their country.     3. Even supposing  the present Government of the  Ukraine  were benevolently disposed towards the scheme of M. Frick, from the information in possession of the War Office it would seem certain that the railways of the  Ukraine are far too congested to enable supplies to be moved with any regularity.     M. Frick&apos;s scheme seems to contemplate the establishment of a belt of concentration stations from the Baltic to Odessa.  Were this carried out, it would mean drawing theRussian  prisoners from west to  east. i.e., in ^the direction from  which  the  Bolshevikdanger is approaching.   This would probably lead to  the  Russian prisoners first  of allbeing fed and cared for at these concentration  stations, and then, lured by the prospectof reaching their homes  from which  they have been  so  long  absent, passing into  theBolshevik lines and  thus coming within the power of the Soviet Government.     It must be remembered in this  connection, that in Soviet  Russia the only personswho receive food are those who are assisting the Bolshevik cause, and principally thosewho join their labour battalions or the Soviet army, so that should these prisoners cross nto a country under the dominion of the Soviet Government, they would be  forced to     &apos; [827]                                                              C
become de facto Bolsheviks, whatever their private sentiments might be.   The penalty for refusal appears to be imprisonment or death.     Another  point  that  arises in considering M.  Frick&apos;s scheme  is that M. Frickpersonally possesses  no power to compel the German authorities to carry out any ideasthat he  may  have  for the betterment of the conditions of life  of the Russians inGermany.  Experience has shown that although a  German Government may promise to carry  out engagements in this respect, its performances are lamentably  behind  itspromises, and  the Allied  prisoners of  war representatives, from  inability to supervisesuch a large extent of country, would find themselves unable to give effective aid.     It is not quite certain what  M. Frick is actually doing with the 500,000 fr. whichthe French Government is stated  to have already advanced him, but if  His majesty&apos;s government contemplate  making a similar advance, it would appear advisable that theyshould lay down, as  exactly as possible, the conditions which they  desire to be broughtabout, and should make certain provisos  calculated to ensure the execution  of theirdesires.   The  scheme which is suggested is as follows:      I. That there should be a small  Allied executive composed of representatives ofthe different Powers providing the money or food, which should meet in  the first placein Paris, and should then  transfer its  headquarters to Berlin  or  some other suitablecentre in the enemy&apos;s territory.     2. That the Russian  prisoners of war should as far as possible be  withdrawn fromthe working commandos,  and especially from all commandos where  they are engaged onheavy or dangerous work, and placed in concentration camps the  latter  being groupedfor control.   (It would probably be convenient to take the  original  German army  corpsdistricts  for this  purpose, as  this  would  facilitate  co-operation  with the  german authorities.)     That in  each district and in each  concentration  camp  there should be  allied representatives responsible for the welfare  of  the prisoners in  their district, but thatthe administration  of the camps and districts  should  be  in  the hands of the german authorities,  who should  be made responsible for  measures of security and  for themaintenance of discipline, the duty of the Allied representatives being (a) to ensure thatthe treatment of the Russian prisoners of war is in consonance with the ideas prevailing in, for  example, Great  Britain  on  this subject;  (b) to  ensure that  food  and  other supplies  sent  to  the districts and camps  from Allied and  other  sources  are made thebest use of for  the benefit of  the prisoners; and (c) to initiate forms of mental and moral treatment which will tend to encourage  in the  minds of the  prisoners a desireand respect for law, order, and established government.     3.  That  when   this  preliminary  condition &quot;of affairs has  been  brought  about,&apos;arrangements should be  made for removing from  such camps such elements  as may show themselves definitely to  be  on the side  of disorder and to  be influencing their fellow-prisoners in this  direction.  On the contrary, that those  elements  who  show themselves  favourably disposed towards  the above  principles  should  be  drafted todefinite  localities with a view to speedy  transfer, as shipping  facilities may  permit,to such parts  of the former Russian Empire which are out  of the dominion of the SovietGovernment,  provided they  elect for this.   It might perhaps be convenient for theseelements to  be  concentrated in localities within the  military  occupation   of theAllied Powers, but this point is not  essential provided the localities chosen are removed from any possibility of coming into the power of the Bolsheviks.     This scheme contemplates  the  provision  of  food  and  medical  comforts to theRussian prisoners of war, who, as being persons who  have fought for the Allies, havean  undeniable  first  claim on any  food which may be  sent  to Germany, and theagreement of the German Government to the proposals of the Allied Governments couldbe made a preliminary condition to the introduction  of food supplies into the country. No stronger inducement  to  Germany to concur could be desired.  For the executionof the scheme the active  assistance of the United States is essential in view of the large numbers to be fed.     It is recognised that M.  Frick  is already at work, and there is no reason so  far as can be foreseen to dispense with his services; but if  the full scheme is to be carried out and the. Germans are to be made to  carry out their part  of the work, it seems essential to associate controlling military and civil, elements with him.  The personages selected to head the Allied  representation should be of sufficient weight  to.  be able to carry the scheme  through against opposition and difficulties.     Finally,  if public support is to be obtained  for the scheme, and if the Russian prisoners&apos; sympathy with our  efforts  to improve their conditions is  to be gained, it is-
important that all attempts to recruit for various military schemes should be studiouslyavoided and one  simple idea carried through feed, clothe, and give a sound mind tothe Russian prisoners treated.     It cannot be too strongly emphasised that every day&apos;s delay in dealing with thisquestion on big lines is increasing the difficulties, as the prisoners are getting more andmore out of control, and is increasing the danger owing to  the fact that already largenumbers of Russians have made their way in a destitute condition into Soviet Russia.
