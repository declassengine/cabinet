            , ,       I         His Britannic ^TIT^^                                _l^ii^oty s Government i:!CRJT.                                6th January, 1919Co-ordinc;.tiorL of demobilisation - ProcedureI     m:nvximu wr w I*?ar cabihss         BY 3IR ERIC G3]DLS. &apos;       I. find that considerable misapprehension exists in the 14 various Linistrios concerned in Demobilisation,both as to the meaning and purport of ray appointment as representing the War Cabinet on the question of demobili-sation, and also as to the procedure to be adopted.       The V/ar Cabinet Minute 513 of Thursday December19th, 1918, appointing me was as follows:-             &quot;The War Cabinet decided -              (l). To place Sir Sric Geddes,, as representing                      and with the authority of the  War Cabinot,                      in charge of the co-ordination of                      demobilisation and the rehabilitation of                      industry, with full power to take                      decisions on their behalf, and to summon                      meetings of the Heads of all Departments                      concerned in this question.              (2). To dissolve the existing Committee on                      Demobilisation, &quot;              In order that the ppsition may be more cloarlydefined I would sugf/est that the War Cabinet should ap-prore the following instructions to the Departments concerned:-                      &quot;Sir Eric Goddes,as Minister in charge              of the Co-ordination of Demobilisation and. the              Rehabilitation of Industry, will in no way              usurp the executive functions of the Ministers              at present responsible,                       In the event of any Minis try-wishing to              obtain Cabinet authority on any subject directly              concerned with Demobilisation, the Minister  re-              sponsible will submit a Memorandum&apos;to&apos; the War
Cabinet in the ordinary way, and in oaso of dif--fersnce of opinion between Ministers which theyfail to reconcile after conference, each minister will subir.it a memorandum, jointly if possible.        This memorandum will either be dealtwith by the War Cabinet in the usual way, or bySir Brie Gedd.es, as may be decided-.        The Jar Cabinet Secretariat will summonmeetings of the Ministers concerned in suchmemoranda either for full Meetings of the WarCabinet or for Sir Eric G-o dd.es !s meetings.        In the event of Sir &apos;3rio Geddes desiringreturns or information, or wishing to initiateproposals, the War Cabinet Secretariat willcommunicate with the Departments concerned.        In questions of emergency where the. aboveprocedure is too slow, tho Minister concerned -willap-ply to the War Cabinet and the question will bedealt with on the abovo principles but in a lessformal way.&apos;        In order to facilitate and expedite the transaction of business,. Sir Erid Geddes has appointed as his assistants              -Sir Robert Home.,-              Sir Rhys Williams.- -              Mr-, Mer z and Lt.&apos;- 0o I. McLe llan *              Major-General Sir Phillip Hash,with Mr* R.3i\ - Dunne 11 as Secretary and it* ColonelJ,G-. Boharroll as Statistician./&quot; These officers are authorised&apos; to keep in touch with&apos;and consultOfficers in tho various Departments in an  Informalway, but will give no directions of any s.orts&quot;                        (Sgd) Sric Ged&amp;ofl.
