BOMBARDMENTS OF BRITISH COAST TOWNS AND PLACES BY THE NAVAL FORCES OF GERMANY.

During the war the coasts of Great Britain were bombarded by the Naval Forces of Germany on 15 occasions, of which the earliest was the 3rd November, 1914, and the latest the 15th May, 1918. In reckoning the number of these bombardments, the naval action of Yarmouth on 3rd November, 1914 has been included, as, although no shell fell above high water mark, it seems probable that a number of the rounds fired were deliberately aimed at the town.

The towns and places against which the bombardments were directed were Seaham;  Hartlepool and West Hartlepool; Whitby; Scarborough; Lowestoft; Yarmouth; Southwold; Magate; Broadstairs; Ramsgate; Dover; the Harrington Works at Lowes;  Walney Island; and St. Kilda, Yarmouth was attacked three times; and Scarborough, Ramsgate and district, and Dover and district each twice.

On three occasions, namely 3rd November, 1914  (Yarmouth); 16th December 1914 (ths Hartlepools, Scarborough and Whittyj; and 24th/25th April, 1916 (Lowestoft and Yarmouth), the hostile operations were carried out by the squadroms of the High Sea Fleet consisting of battle cruisers acoompanied by destroyers, and on the occasion of the attack on Lowestoft and Yarmouth accompanied by Z?ns also. The attacks on Walney Island (29th January  1915); on the Harrington Works (16th August 1915]; on Seaham;  the second attach on Scarborough (4th September 1917);  and the attack on St. Kilda  (15th May 1918) were made by submarines. On all the other occasions (viz:  25th January, 25th February, 17th/l8th March, 20th/21st April, and 26th/27th April 1917, and 14th January and 15th/l6th February 1918), destroyers only were employed.

The total casualties caused by these bombardments were;- Naval and Military, 15 killed and 20  injured;  Civilian, 158 killed and 611 injured. The value of the damage done to civilian property was about £100,000.

In April 1918, histories of all those bombardments, with the exception of the second attack on Dover on  15th/16th February 1918, and the attack on St. Kilda on 15th May of that year, were prepared  by the intelligence Section, General Headquarters, Home Forces. Similar histories of the second attack on Dover and  the attack on St. Kilda were subsequently prepared. These histories contain, with respect to each of the 15  naval raids above mentioned:- (i) Information, where available, as to the composition  of the  attacking naval force;
BOMBARDMENTS OF BRITISH COAST TOWNS AND PLACES BY THE NAVAL FORCES OF GERMANY.

During the war the coasts of Great Britain were bombarded by the Naval Forces of Germany on 15 occasions, of which the earliest was the 3rd November, 1914, and the latest the 15th May, 1918. In reckoning the number of these bombardments, the naval action off Yarmouth on 3rd November, 1914 has been included, as, although no shell fell above high water mark, it seems probable that a number, of the rounds fire were deliberately aimed at the town.

The towns and places against which the bombardments were directed were Seaham; Hartlsppol and West Hartlepool; Whitby; Scarborough; Lowestoft; Yarmouth; Southwold; Margate; Broadstairs; Ramsgate; Dover; the Harrington Works at Lowes; Walney Island; and St. Kilda, Yarmouth was attacked three times; and Scarborough, Ramsgate and  district each twice.

On three occasions, namely 3rd Novembtr, 1914 (Yarmouth); 16th December 1914 (the Hartlepools, Sqarbarough and Whitby); and 24th/25th April, 1916 (Lowestoft and Yarmouth), the hostile-operations were carried out by squadrons of the High Sea Fleet consisting of battle cruisers and cruisers accompanied by destroyers, and on the occasion of the attack on Lowestoft and Yarmouth attack on Lowestoft and Yarmouth accompanied by Z?ns also. The attacks on Walney Island (29th January 1915); on the Harrington Works (16th August 1915); on Seaham; the second attack on Scarborough (4th September 1917);  and the attack on St, Kilda (15th May 1918) were made by submarines. On all the other occasions (viz: 25th January, 25th February, 17th/18thMarch, 20th/21st April, and 26th/27th April 1917, and 14th January and 15th/l6th February 1918), destroyers only were employed.

The total casualties caused by these bombardments were:- Naval and Military, 15 killed and 20 injured; Civilian, 158 killed and 611 injured. The value of the damage done to civilian property was about £100,000.

In April 1918, histories of all these bombardments, with the exception of the second attack on Dover on 15th/l6th February 1918, and the attack on St. Kilda on 15th May of that yeap, were prepared by the Intelligence Section, General Headquarters, Home Forces. Similar histories of the second attack on Dover and the attack on St. Kilda were subsequently prepared. These histories contain, with respect to each of the 15 naval raids above mentioned:- (i) Information, where available, as to the composition of the attacking naval force;
(ii)  A description of the place or places attackedspecifying (among otnor things) the nature of its defences(if&quot;any),  and what (if any) military works,  or military or naval establishments,  or depots of arms or warmateriel,  or workshops qr plant that could bo utilised for the needs of the Fleet or Army, were theresituate; &apos;  (iii)  A narrative of the bombardment;(iv)  Esoert observations as to the objects at whichtho enemy&apos;1:s fire was probably direoted, whethersuccessfully or not;  and (v)  A statement of the casulties caused and the material damage done, withdetails as to the character and location of thebuildings  struck.  The histories are illustrated by mapson -which are indicated the position and movements ofthe attacking forces, the extent of the area affectedby the bombardment^ and the positions of the placesstruck by  shells,     All these histories  and maps were  rroducedto the Bub-Committee at the Horse Guards on 6th inst.,by Lieut,-Colf de vVatteville, end the Sub-Committeewent through them with him, and had the benefit ofhis supplementary observations and explanations.     V/ith  this information before them the Sub-Commit beehave carefully considered all the circumstances ofeach bombardment, including: ;the character of theplace bombarded;   the extent to which the enemy1sfire was probably directed to the destructionof military defences or military or naval worksor establishments etc.;  whether (having regard to thefact that  in no case was  the bombardment preceded  byany summons or notice) there would be plausibleground for an allegation that immediate action wasnecessary  and that no delaycould be allowed consistently with the safety of the attaching force&quot;;  and theexistence  of evidence by which responsibility forordering the bombardment or carrying it out could bebrought home to particular officers, or by whichparticular ships could be shown to have participated .in it.     The bub-Committee do not doubt that one of the objects of the majority of the raids was toterrorise  the inhabitants.of the Best Coast and KentCoast towns, and to create the impression that theBritish had not control of the Worth Sea;  and itis true that.their military effect was insignificant.But the full histories of these raids show that there was more military justification for certain of them thanone would  infer from the statements contained in theBritish Official communiques issued with respect tothenwH  For instance,  it is said that after, the attack on theHartlepools and Scarborough the enemy only escaped boingcut off and surrounded on their way home by the mainBritish Fleet owing to thick and squally weather,
The Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that it is ?rable that the bombardment of Scarborough, Whitby and West Hartlepool on the 16th December 1914 should be made the subject of ?harge before the Tribunal.

There is prima facie evidence to show that the Squadron  which carried out the bombardment of 16 December 1914 was composed the 1st and 2nd Scouting Groups of the High Sea Fleet, consisting the following vessels:-

?TLE CRUISERS

"DERFFLINGER", "SEYDLITZ", "MOLTLE", "VON DER TANN".

?ISSR

"BLUCHER".

?T CRUISERS -

"ROSTOCK", "GRAUDENZ", "STRALSUND", "STRASSBURG", "K0LBERG".

?gether with several flotillas of torpedo boat destroyers.

The evidence indicates that the "DERFFLINGER" and "K0LBERG" ? not actually take part in tho bombardment, and that the remaining ?ssels, on proaching the British Coast, formed 2 Divisions, one of ?ch bombarded Scarborough and whitby and the other the two Hartlepools. ? precise composition of those 2 Divisions has not been satisfactority certained, and there is some conflict of evidence on the point.

In the opinion of the Sub-Committee it would, therefore, be ?tter that a general charge covering these three separate bombardments would be formulated.

Scarborough possessed no fixed defences. It contained a ?ast Guard Station and some disused barracks, and, in the suburb of ?sgrave, a Wireless Telegraph Station, but nothing else that could ? described as a military work or a work of military or naval utility.

The  bombardment was carried out probably by battle cruisers together with light cruisers. They opened fire at a range of about ?000 yards from the pier on the Coast Guard Station and barracks and recked both buildings; and though they failed to damage the Wireless Telegraph Station, it would seem that at one time their fire was directed at it; but in the main the bombardment was a wanton and reckessly indiscriminate shelling of the town from end to end. Seventenn civilians were killed and 120 injured, and the value of the material damage done to civilian buildings was about £30.000.

The bombardment of Scarborough lasted from 8.0 a.m. to 8.30 a.m. ? about half an hour later the ships by which it had been carried ?t appeared off Whitby. Whitby, like Scarborough, had no fixed ?fences. The attacking force opened fire at a range of about 2 miles. ? Port War  Signal Station/

It is almost incredible that the bombarding vessels would have approached so close inshore if they had believed that Scarborough was fortified as stated in their communiques.

                                                                                                              I
and  Coast Guard Station ware damaged.   The Abbey was struckby 2 or 3 shells.   But the most serious damage was in thedistrict immediately at the back of East Cliff.   The casual-ties were few, fortunately, but the material damage to civil-ian  property amounted in value to about  10,000.       Simultaneously with the bombardment of Scarborough, andas part of the same operations, Jiartlepool and West Hartlepoolwere shelled  by the cruiser &quot;BL&apos;0CHER&quot; and other vessels.Hartlepool was a defended port;  the land batteries there anda small naval flotilla consisting of 2 scouts and 4 destroyersgave a good account of themselves;  and, BO far a3 the bombard-ment was directed against Hartlepool, the Sub-Committee do not recommend that any proceedings in respect of it should be instituted.  But the bombardment of West Hartlepool brands on* different footing.  TTesfc H-rtlSjU&apos; 1 liH&amp;Cnt fixtd defences,anft&apos;&quot;the bombardment of the town ceerac to have bekn quitein isoriminate,      - Fifty-six civilians were killed or subsequently died ofinjuries and 222 were more or less seriously injured;  and  Oohouses and a number of churches and schools were damaged.       The Sub-Committee understand that a feature of almost every naval engagement during the war has been the acouraterange-taking and good fire discipline of the Germane so longas they were not being hit,   It cannot be assumed, therefore,that the promiscuous distribution of fire by which these bom-bar dments of 1 6th December 1914 were characterised was unavoidable-able or even unintentional,.       With regard to the other coast bombardments, the Sub-Committee have come to the.conclusion that owing either to thecharacter of the place bombarded or to the unsatisfactory natureof the evidence it is not desirable that proceedings should be instituted in respect of any of them.       The Sub-Committee have considered whether in the proceed-ings they have recommended, Convention No; IX of the HagueConventions, 1907, (&quot;Concerning Bombardments by Naval ForceB intime of War&quot;) would be held to have been binding on the accused.They are of the opinion that it would not.   The Conventioncontains the usual provision that it is not to apply &quot;exceptbetween Contracting Powers&quot;, and then only if. all the belli-gerents are parties to the Convention.   Even at the date ofthe  earliest raid all the then belligerents were not partiesto the Convention.   The Convention was not ratified by Bulgaria,Greece, Italy, Serbia or Turkey.   -       Serbia was one of the belligerents before the 3rdNovember 1914, and a state of war was declared between GreatBritain and Turkey on the ^th November 1914.       But the Sub-Committee regard Convention IX of 1907 asbeing in the main, declaratory of the law a and usages of warthen already recognised;  and the conclusions to which theyhave come have net been affected by the fact that the Conventionmay  not be applicable.       Appended to this report is a list in whioh are named anddesignated the officers against whom, in the opinion of theCommittee, proceedings might properly be taken in respect ofthe  bombardment of Scarborough, Whitby and West Hartlepool.
     The, &quot;Chief of the Admiral staff  would have Vs*n  in^ludadin the list, hut Admiral van pohl who held  that&apos;position inDecember 1914 is dead.  The Oommander-in-Chief  of  the HighSea Fleet is included because the bombardment fnrmed part ofa big. operation; in which the greater part  of the  High  SeaFleet participated,  and the admiral  Commanding  the bombardingSquadron would,  have acted under the immediate  orders of the &apos;Commander-in-Chief.  The Chief Gunnery Officer  of  each  ship is included because he would be responsible for direoting and distributing the fire of the guns.  The officer who  was in&quot;command of the &quot;BLUCEill&apos;&apos; in December 1914 is dead, as is alsothe Chief Gunnery officer of the &quot;STR.^LSOTDn; and  the Sub-Committee have not included in the list    the  Commanders ofthe &quot;DIRFKLINGER&quot; and &quot;XOLBURG&quot; as those ships  appear not tohave taL.  .. part in the bombardment but to have  been  engagedin minelayin^.     It is very desirable that any written orders  in regardto the bombardment that were issued by the  Admiral Staff, bythe commander-in-Ohief of the High Sea Fleet,  or by  the admiral commanding the bombarding Squadron-,  and any official reportsthat were made regarding the bombardment should be obtained.     The sub-Corn.ittee recommend     That the Government take at the earliest possible  m.omentthe necessary steps     (i)  to secure the arrest or preventive detention  and          surrender of the persons named or designated  in          the&apos;Appendix / hereto.     (ii) to obtain production and delivery of  all written          orders issued by the Admiral Staff,  the  Commander-          in-ohief of the High Sea Fleet, and the  Admiral        -  Commanding the bombarding squadron,  and  all          German official reports, relating to  the bombard-          ment of the East Coast of England on  16  December          1914.Signed on behalf of the  Sub-Comrdtteei             (Sgd.)
