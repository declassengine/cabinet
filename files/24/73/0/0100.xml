                                POLITICAL BICiSLLIO/Jadll i/a^ivi&apos;!.,. 1; evidential.                            -         OAVIUW, January 2&amp;Ed,1919.        --x       v (gwh                         Germany/031 -           .&apos; fl  THE  fflGhT OffOR OKDLR UN BLJl&amp;Dk I,   6&quot;/&apos;  &apos;   ;,/-&apos;//__,---------------------------                        Later stage.      The elections  for the National Constituent Assembly took place throughout Germany on Sunday, January 19, and, if ^rjnan--repoTts are  to be believed, were conducted under eon-nli^ons -JQ - comparative order.   In Berlin at any rate no disturbances appear to have interfered with the polling. Participation to the extent of 80 and in some cases over 90 per cent of  -the electorate is reported.      The newspaper  offices which the Spartacus bands had occupied weie recaptured by the Government troops on the 11th and. I2the  Isolated encounters continued on three Or four subsequent days, and the disturbed condition of the.city was shown by the circumstances of the violent deaths of Karl Lieb- knecht  and Rosa Luxemburg on the night of the 15th.   Eosa Luxemburg, a Polish Jewess and communist agitator between 50&apos;and 60  years of age, was certainly murdered by the mob, Liebknecht appears  to have been shot when attempting to escape from the guard of soldiers which was conveying him to prison.      The events -which led up to the provisional triumph of the Majority Socialist  Government e:U)ioited the difficulties with which they had to contend.  Alter, the suppression or the subsidence of the Sailors&apos; insurrection at the Berlin Castle, there was a split in the Government, the three Minority Socialist members,  Haase, Dittman and Barth, having insisted upon calling their  Majority colleagues Libert, Scheidemann and Landsberg to account before the Central Council of German Jorkmen and Soldiers, which provisionally represents the
sovereign people. The elaborate verdict given by this Central Council, although it condemned the methods adopted by General Lequis in command of the Government troops, nevertheless approved of the action of the Majority members of the Government in directing the military authorities to take steps for the liberation of Wels, the socialist Governor of Berlin, whose life was supposed to be in danger while he was in the custody of the sailors. This finding and the indecisive replies of the Central Council of Workmen and Soldiers on a variety of general questions of policy was regarded as unsatisfactory by the three Minority Ministers and they resigned on December 30th.

Three Majority Socialists, Noske, till then Governor of Kiel, Wissel, a metal-worker and Trade Union Secretary and Leebe, a Silesian Editor, were appointed to succeed them. Loebe refused to act and the Government has since consisted of only five members.

3. Far more formidable was the armed opposition in the streets which was initiated by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. It turned out that this movement had been long in preparation and that it was supported by Russian Bolshevist money or organised by Russian agents, particularly by Radek, director of the Bolshevist Government&apos;s foreign propaganda, who was present in person.

The rank and file of the Spartacist forces was furnished by deserters from the Army, some of the sailors now haunting Berlin, a number of working-men, recruited, sometimes by threats, from the great factories, and a considerable collection of hooligans, both male and female. Liebknecht was everywhere active. He drove about Berlin in a motor-car armed with machine guns and ? meetings at street corners or in front of the Chancellor&apos;s Palace, the recent seat of Government. More obscure Spartacist and Bolshevist agents are to be seen in the heart of the city, in the Leipziger Strasse for example, addressing     
small knots of people.

The Government especially Scheidemann and Ebert, were denounced as "assassins" for having suppressed by arms the disturbances of December 24th. They were accused of setting up a dictatorship - the very thin ? and the Spartacus group, the spokesman of a ? minority, were themselves aiming at.

4. The most important practical factor in the movement was probably the Communist Police President Eichhorn, who in pre-war days had directed the Press Bureau of the Socialist Party in Berlin and subsequently served the Spartacist movement in the same capacity. Eichhorn was installed after the Revolution as Prefect of Police in the ? building on the Alexander Platz, not by the Government but by the so-called Executive of the Berlin Workmen and Soldiers&apos; council. This is a small committee which has throughout been acting in a purely arbitary fashion without consulting those who originally gave it its mandate. When summoned by the Government to relinquish his post, Eichhorn entrenched himself behind the self-constituted authority of this Committee and refused to ?. He made the Prefecture of Police a perfect arsenal of the Spartacist-Bolshevist forces. The place was full of machine-guns rifles and hand-grenades as well as provisions of all kinds captured by the Spartacus bands from railway stations, and the food depots, and from wagons in the streets or shops in the neighbourhood of the Alexanderplatz.

5. The operations began with the capture of the Majority Socialist Vorwaerts newspapers office on January 3rd or 4th. Other newspaper offices were subsequently occupied, including those of the democratic Berliner Tageblatt, the industrialist Lokal Anze? and the reactionary Kruzzeitung. The localities are fairly distant from each other, the ? offices, for example,   
                                                            475   1                          *:r&apos;.-&apos;                                     Ilye jng^s ^ar-from^ is from St, Paul&apos;s.. Altogether- the operations of the Suartacus- Bolsbevists were scattered over a wide area, a fact which shows that the Governments defences must at the outset have &quot;been badly 6rganized.  The more serious fighting was in the central districts of Berlin, for the  offices of the SerlinfiX-SJagfiblaJii and the Vorwaerts, for the premises of Wolff&quot;B Bureau, for the Silesian Railway station and for the Prefecture of Police,  But there were also almost daily  encounters at the Brandenburger Gate and at the Reichstag buildings, and even as far out into the suburbs as Ealensce in the Grunewald, a point comparable in point of remoteness with the position  of Kew Gardens as regards the western traffic centres of.London,  The Spartacistsiaust have been able to move freely between these distant points.  Indeed it is known that they were in a position to bring up arms and ammunition from the factor- ies at Spandau, which for a time were in the possession of their local bands.     When the various strongholds of the Spartacists had been stormed, Liebkneoht, Rosa Luxemburg, Eichhorn, Radek, and the rest *f the leaders dispersed and went into hiding,  Liebknecht and Frau Luxemburg were arrested at the house of a friend with the sequel - - which is known.  Of Bichhorn and Ra&amp;ek there is as yet no trace, (Sichhorn, it may  be noted, is one of those since elected for Berlin to the National Assembly).  In some of the newspaper offices which had been held for a week, a good many male and female Sparta- cists -  hundreds in some  cases - were taken prisoners,-&apos;   It  is assert ed by the Majority Journals that  thy Spartacists when they  sallied into  the  streets frequently placed wemon and children in  their  lines and  exposed  them to the fire cf^the GoTbrr^nent  troops.    Everywhere great euantities of munitions  as well as cf provisions had  been collected  in  the Spartacist strongholds0  The printing-prases  were
                                    4 76doubtless used for producing these Spartacus. leaflets of&apos; wUiob.an anormous number were distributed in the streets.     It is not easy to form a coherent picture of the state of berlin during these days of mortal crisis.  On the whole thekQU g 2ig population seems to have maintained its characteristicdetachment and its somewhat cynical attitude of indifference.The Berlin correspondent of the frankfurter Zeitung^ writes;             &quot;The population of Berlin has always borne a peculiar          character *  It never had the faculty qf winning friend-          ship in the Empire, and the present manifestations          Will not increase sympathy for the Capital.  The Berliner        ,  is indeed cold, one might even say indifferent.   Per          three days past lively conflicts have been proceeding          In the main streets cf the city.  Hand-grenades  are          exploding and the continuous roll of machine-guns is          audible now here, now there.  Tbe dead are being borne          av/ay, and we who at one of the central points of the          conflict discharge our journalistic duties behold only          too often the Red Cross people at their work. All this          affects the Berliner very little.  He soon became          accustomed to the street fighting.  He is now a fatalist          and thinks he bears a charmed life.  In one street          the struggle is raging, in the next wandering pedlars          are  oing a splendid Business:,  Sailors and field-grey          soldiers have set up- a miniature Monte- Carl?, careless          ox the roll of machine-gunfire and the sharper crack          oi rifles.  Empty wooden boxes are turned into a gambling-          table and the &quot;revolution-profiteers1 are more than          gensrous with their stakes/ At the opposite street-          porner a Spartacist agitator with his Russian methods          toursues his task,&quot;        /        &apos;     On ^ome days the Banks were closed, but on most days theywere open.  The Imperial Bank with its  100,000,000 reserve ofgold i/as once reported to be in the hands of the Spartacists;it turned out that it was guarded by a detachment of sailors whoprocessed neutrality.  The Imperial Printing Office was actuallyhjeid by the Spartacists for a day.  They omitted to seise a large took of freshly-printed banknotes or the plates for printing  -them and contented themselves with pilfering about  5 of the petty belongings of the employees. Frankfurter Zeitung, Jan, 10, 2nd homing Edition. No 25,
     The Government wore accused &quot;by the hour&amp;QQis press,  includlj-jsome of the Radical journals, of half-heartedness and inderu-vionbecause they did not more promptly take measures for repressingthe excesBos.  The explanation wat first, thaij as Socialists andprofessed humanitarians, thoy shrunk from the responsibilityfor bloodshed, especially in a confliot with political opponents;secondly,&apos; that their own military preparations were not at firstsatisfactory.  They seem not to have known upon what forces oftho regular army they could depend.  They more than once changed the leadership of the troops, until they found in Colonel Reinhardta commander who could be trusted not to use his victory farpurposes tf reaction.  Thoy need not have been so excessivelycautious.  The troops were quite conscious of what was involved,and fought far ordered democratic government against Bolshevistanarchy,  Tbero is a strong prejudice even among Majority Social-ists against the old officer class, so often lauded by the lateEmperor as the surest bulwark of the old regime.  The officersgave praiseworthy proofs of their devotion to the new order bydonning the uniform of privates and fighting in tho ranks cf theGovernment forces*  Most of them have broken with the old regimefor good.  There is a consensus of testimony that the Hohenzollernsand tho other dynasties, exopot perhaps &quot;that of Baden, have forfeited the loyalty of the officer class by their flight in the hourof danger*     Finally there is tho attitude of the Minority Socialists toconsider.  They certainly have not improved their position- Theydo not appear to have descended into the streets with theSpartaoists, but they continued to the last to attack and&apos; hamperthe Government in its efforts to restore order.  Thoy made&apos; futileattempts at &quot;mediation&quot; which amounted to a proposal that a new
Government should be formed of two Majority men, two of the minority Socialists and two Spartacists - one of these to beLiebknechtJ   So far as politioal principles are concerned! thoifchief point was that the Government^ which rightly admits iteolfto be merely provisional poritiiiig the decisions Of the MotionalAssembly, should at once proceed to large measures of uw-tional^isation, socialisation and confiscation.  This attitude soncilia*ted neither side.  The Minority leaders, Haase, tlittman and Barthare attacked even more violently by the Spartacists than by thoorgans of the Government.  It remains to be seen whether theresult of the General Election will enable them to play any fur-ther part&apos;in the political development of,Germany,
