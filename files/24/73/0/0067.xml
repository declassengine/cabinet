In the West however there are oomplaints of excessive wet.   &quot;&apos; 1. District Agricultura^^Exep^UTeJ]oT^iUees(i.           Committees Ire receiving  from&apos;-larmeravtheir proposals for cropping  for the ensuingseason-, and are tabulating returns. 2. Grass Parks and Kjlkll.rpducJ,j,&amp;r. . -           The Board, as at present  advised, db not propose to take any action with regard to the  letting of grass parks next season for grazing purposes.   They will therefore not edopt the policy as in  jast year of taking possession of grass lands under Defence of the Bealm Regulations and allotting them to persons in want of grazing for stock displaced through increased oroppihg. The Board have %Supressed the view that milk production is-to be considered as important as the growing of cereals, and Committees are accordingly being advised to do nothing which would interfere with the production of milk, either  immediate or prospective.   In Dairying Districts this policy will of course interfere with the further ploughing up of frase land. 3. Allotments.           The Board have, issued a circular to Town Clerks and  a selected number of Parish Clerks requesting a return showing the areas under allotments in their respective districts.   Irom statistics received it has been ascertained that  approximately 44,824 areas  comprising 3484 acres  were  cultivated during 1918 aa allotments. 4.

The&quot; Committee submitted recommendations to the Board regarding the election and functions  of  these bodies.

On con-  rsideration of a report made by .one of their officials who visited  the farm and  confirmed the  report  submitted by the proprietors,  the Board were satisfied that  thib  was a case which called for action under  the Defence of  the Realm Regulations.
