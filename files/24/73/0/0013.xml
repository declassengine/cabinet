7th January,  1919.        POST WAR FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR TOIGTRY XVD POSTe^^B/A/xN,   MR STRENGTH OF THE ROYAL AIR F03C.13.                                     ......  \ 6&amp;(3  ^fa^^ty ^emo randum of the War Cabinet.            (War Cabinet Paper - G. T. 6478)           The Air Ministry paper covers the whole ground ofthe future development of Aviation,  but parts of  this  largesubject are necessarily dealt with therein only in principle.           Speaking generally,  the policy advocated appears in the opinion of the Admiralty to be sound, in the best interests of British Aviation and calculated to assist thisEmpire to jump into a similar position as regards commercialair routes to that occupied in the commercial sea routes.           The practical solution of the problem of flightand development to its present stage ncrk the commencementof a new era in the world&apos;s transport:  traffic is civilisa-tion and transport means control and our predominant Navalposition is due,  not only to the volume of our own trafficbut to the fact that we transport for the world.      If,therefore, the British Empire with its scattered possessionsand world-wide producing power, both latent and developed,  isto maintain its leading position, it is essential that weshould, occupy a similar position in Aerial transport to thatwhich we have occupied in Sea transport.      &amp;J   Apart from the many technical Aircraft problems involved in carrying out such a policy there is a vast amountof preparation required in the institution of devices  whichcorrespond -to charts, light-ship3, buoys, land marks,  sound-ings and navigation devices generally;  also harbours, fuellingdepots, special meteorology, etc.     The while work can,  itis thought best be undertaken by a specialised Ministrythoroughly permeated with a knowledge of navigation, machinery,and weather, but with air experience, and in sufficientlyclose touch with the industrial world.           For this purpose the Air Ministry will requireat least for the next few years, to maintain some form ofPioneer service to open., up the air routes which our coramer-cial (or Military)-strategy shew to be necessary - to a em e as-&quot;demonstrate their possibilities - and to discover and specifythe various detailed problems to be solved  in the interestsof regular Aerial traffic therein.           The above work appears  too great for privateenterprise to undertake on anything like a  sufficient scale,but is essential if British Empire Aviation is to developquickly.     When these services and the subsidiary services for establishing landing grounds, telephone systems, naviga-tional aids, refuelling depots, etc. have finished their workover any given route, then that route can be thrown open atonce to commercial firms for Aerial traffic work, An such a,way as to give preference to British Empire enterprise ,  &quot;butthe proper establishment of such facilities would appear tobe as necessary for  commercial aviation as  are roads and rail-ways for land transport or corresponding aids for sea transport           Nine months experience of Naval  Contingentssupplied from a separate Air Force leai the Admiralty to
PjSRSOTOL EMPLOYED IN MERCANTILE ABRIAL TRANSPORT.     3.    It is suggested that the relations of the AirMinistry with all Mercantile Aerial persohnel might be analagousto those of the Admiralty with Mercantile Sea personnel,which in effect is our Naval Reserve.     The Officershaving an official uniform, while those who actually belong to the royal Naval Reserve undergo periods of training whichare made worth their while.     Nevertheless there exists in peace time absolute freedom of contract, so far as theAdmiralty is concerned,  between the personnel of the MercantileMarine and the Shipowners.  .AERIAL WAR ORGANISATION.     4*&quot;    The Admiralty make no apology for dealing with theCivil&quot;as well as the General aspect of aviation because intheir opinion our National aviation&apos; position in years to comemay determine our success in war or possibly our power to makewar.           Naval warfare as such is organised and directed by the Admiralty,&apos; including operations of Air Force units which act in conjunction with Naval Forces and there shouldbe no change in tha  principle that the defence of the Empireagainst sea aggression is an Admiralty responsibility.   Butas aerial aggression develops into a distinctive form of warfare such, for example,, as bombing raids on industrial centres by forces operating from distant theatres, the strategy and operation of our Aerial defence would appear to be theresponsibility of the Air Ministry who nevertheless wouldrequire Military assistance such as Ground Artillery, Civilassistance such as Railway transport    or Naval assistancesuch as sea transport, placed at their disposal for the purpose, pnthe 3ame gwiM?ft&apos;l lines as the Air Force Units are now placed at the disposal of the Admiralty and War Off ice .for taking their necessary part in Naval and Military operations.     5.    The Admiralty consider that by placing upon theAir Ministry responsibility for defence of the Empire againstAerial attack,  while limiting the amount to be spent purelyon this service, we should cause the Air Ministry through itsvarious departments t;o mquAd the training of the personnel and develop the design and materiel in the direction suited tothis end.  In the course of years when the technique of air-craft and its equipment, particularly artillery, has developedfurther, we may require to maintain large standing fleets ofwar aircraft, apart from the Units required as auxiliaries to naval or Military forces, and our organisation should be not inconsistent with this possibility.     6.    It is desirable that the personnel of the AirForce should be strengthened by seconding young officers and support strongly the view that it would be in the Rationalinterest if the Air Ministry supplied complete Units to carryout the Arr work of such Departments as the Board of Trade,Post Office, Revenw^ather than that each Department shouldhave its own Air Force.     The departments would naturallyhave control of the Units so far as their departmental work is concerned.           Probably the organisation of- for example, AirMail.Service Units would quickly develop into somethinganalagous to that of large Merchant Ships; officers wearinguniform and belonging to the Air Reserve,  the skilled menwearing uniform and being engaged for a definite period andthe un-skilled men not wearing uniform and being engagedlocally and temporarily.
men  of  the Navy and Amy for definite periods;  these wouldnot  only permeate the whole Air Force with ITfval and Militarytradition and sentiment, but would take back with them totheir parent services an up to date appreciation of flyingpossibilities in every sphere of aerial activity,     76    For the reasons outlined in the previous paragraphs the  Admiralty are in sympathy with and concur generally inthe  scheme proposed by the Air Ministry- subject to certainprovisoes which it is considered essential to lay down inthe  Naval interest.     These are stated in the following paragraphs..     8.    It is probable that the standard of airmanshipattainable in a Flying Service confined solely to  the sphere of flying work which could be legitimately associated withNaval operations would be below the standard attainable in alarge Flying Service covering every sphere of Aerial activity.At t^ie  same&apos; time,  experience of the past nine months hasshown certain difficulties and inconvenience^ where Air force units have been serving on board His Majesty&apos;s \ifar Ships*   Itis considered essential, thereforef  that such Air force personnel shall form a definite portion of the complement of warships during their stay on board; that they shall be entirelyunder Naval discipline and shall take part in the general workof the  Ships other than their special duty,  &apos;  This rule neednot  apply to ships which are exclusively Aircraft  Carriers,  orto Air Force Units operating from shore base30           Since it will now be possible for considerable timeuo be spent in the training of Airlbrce  personnel there isno reason why such personnel should not be competent in engineering, navigating, care of auxiliary machinery and othermatters which the Air Force and the Navy will have in common;and  a system of lending or seconding personnel could readily be arranged,                 also     9.,   It must/be recognised that the young officers andmen  of  the Navy will naturally have a strong inclination to fly  and if it were accepted as a principle that Naval personnelshould.never, fly the class of candidate fr the Navy mightdeteriorate.           The Admiralty therefore suggest that the complementof the Navy should be maintained at from 5 to 20 per cent(according to rank) above what is required to man the ships and that this proportion shall be seconded in periods of about two years to the Royal Air Force; afterwards, returning, for at least one year, to carry out ordinary Naval work - whan thequestion of their being seconded for a further period could beraised again.     10.   No attempt hasr been made in this paper to deal indetail with the proposed Air Programme for the Navy;  this isnow under discussion with the Air Ministry.   It is; however,necessary to remark that, from.the brief mention of lighter  .than Air Services,, the Air Einistry would appear to attachless importance to this siS/tnah&apos; ao^the Admiralty ,     Itis considered therefore, that the acceptance of the completeprogramme should be subject to agreement - between the AirMinistry, and Admiralty. ,                                (Signed)  R, E. VMYSS.                                            7th January, 1919.
