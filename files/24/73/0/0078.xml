Colonel -Toner..This Document265abolition of censorship;   MmxMmM fta  MmAmi of tbq Board pi fa&amp;gu           On the 17th December I circulated to theMembers of tho War Cabinet Memorandum prepared in theBoard of Trade in which  the suggestion that the existingcensorship restrictions  should he continuod after theofficial conclusion of the Peace negotiations was strongly opposed.           Since tot dcto a month has passed and I nowfeel compelled to go  further and ui^e that the censorshipshould at once ho abolished, or at the least Tory greatlylimited in its sphere of operations.   Against thearguments for retention  advanced from the point of viewof tho blockade, there  iv- the severe aid continuedstagnation of trade to take into account, and recoveryis certainly retarded by the restraints imposed by the censorship,   If trade aoes not greatly improve soon themost serious effects  on  employment must supervene, andtherefore, in my opinion, the greatest weight should beattached io business  recrairoments,           3y the representations which have reached me fromSoveral quarters more particularly from some leadingChambers of Connerce, 1  am confirmed in my conviction tbetcaused&apos;*by the censorship restrictions.           It is not only  the inevitable delay (which maybe a serious matter in business even when it is notlengthy) that is complained of. but also the restriction on the use of cablo codes  and Telegraphic addresses whichincreases croonseaid loads to congestion on the cablesand further delay in the transmission of mossagos.The London Chamber of  Cor&amp;force, in pressing for a returnto pre-war conditions  at the earliest possible moment,in tie interests of the trade of the country, points outthat tho present services are  inadequate even for presentneeds and&apos;that the use of orivato codes increases theefficiency of existing lines.           At a time when  it is ur^ont that the traders ofthis country should be encouraged in every way it is of theutmost importance that the  question of al;owing a retnmto the unrestricted use of postal and tele (graphic facilities at the oarliost possible moment should receive the mostserious consideration  of tho War Cabinet.A.
