Colonel Jones%iol7   I  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS TO &quot;BLOOKADJ&quot; COUNTRIES.       Memorandum fey the President of the Board of Trade       I&apos;ho Provision in the Armistice that the Blockade shall be maintained, has been made the basis of a policy of maintaining rigorously nearly all the restrictions on the exportation of goods&apos; to the neutral countries border - ing on Germany, i.e. Sweden, Norway. Denmark, Holland and Switzerland which prevailed during the war.      At the time of the Armistice the exportation to these countries of practically &amp;U articlessas prohibited except under licence.  As regards the rest of the world, a large number of articles (on the so-called A.list) were prohibited to be exported to any destination and a certain number of others (on tbe B,list) to any destination outside the British  iimpirs.   The main object of these two latter descriptions of prohibition was the conservation of British or Allied resources.  All the principal raw  materials and foods were on the A.list,  but there were in  addition a very large number of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods on either the A.  or the B.  lists over the exportation of which the military and other requirements of this  country made it essential to maintain control during the war.   The cessation of military operations with the consequent falling off cf tho demand for materials  and good3 for military purposes and the  easing of the  shipping situation have  made it possible  to abandon a  vary&quot;large number of-the  prohibitions of exportation previously  enforced,  and further reductions in the prohibition list  are being carried out  as rapidly as possible.    Before long  it is contemplated  that thoso general prohibitions of export will apply only  to very few articles  outside  the foodstuffs and raw materials which  it may still  be necessary to  control  in  the  interosts of  the requirements of  this country and her Allies.    Put so  long as the pregent,blockade policy is^her^gd, to  the  exportJ2l all those  articles  wilP still remain prohibited to most neutral 3nropean  countries.    Tins prohibition  entails not only a strict  limitation of  the  quantities of all  goods allowed to go  to  tho countries,  out the compliance with elaborate  formalities which  place serious obstacles in theway even of the limited amount of trade with these countrieswhich  is permitted.    Thus  good3 sent  to Holland hava tobe  consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust,  and  theconsent of  this body to the  consignment has first  to beobtained and consents and guarantees have similarly to boobtained from  the appropriate bodies in the caso 01 con-signments  to Switzerland and Scandinavia,     A very limited list of articles which are  froed fromthese requirements has boon agreed to by  tho  BlockadeCommittee  (See Annex attached), and I understand  that itis possible that some further additions to this free listmay shortly be made.     But it is svident that- the linoson which the Committee are at present proceeding are socautious that/no
no great increase of freedom for  tho export tradaj/ithHolland and Scandinavia is at present to be looked forwithout a substantial change in policy which can onlybe taken by the Allied Governments acting in concert.There is no possible room for doubt what the interestsof the United Kingdom are in this matter.     It is a very serious matter that at a time whenevery possible encouragement ought to bo given to the revival and expansion of trade in order to maintainemployment and improve tho exchanges ovary sort ofdiscouragement is placed in the way of our manufacturers and traders desiring to carry on trade with a very important group of markets.  There is no prospectwhilst these conditions continue, of any effort beingmade not merely to regain our pro-war position, but,  asis certainly desirable, to secure trade formerly inGerman nands.     \7G are bound to assume that our Allies andAssociates such as $Vance and America who are represent-ed on the Allied Blockado Committee are loyally adhering to the common understanding in regard to tnese matters,but it is only ri(&amp;t to say that many letters havereached ma which indicate that there is at least a widespread opinion that neither Franoe nor America regard it as necessary to adopt an attitude so rigorous as ourselves.     I am of opinion that the time has come when the question should definitely be faced whethar existingBlockade requirements would not be sufficiently met ifadequate precautions are taken to prevent the directtr indirect exportation to enemy countries of foodsraw materials and munitions of war and whether all theJ&amp;chinary framed to prevent the possibility, of manufaot-nred goods reaching tier via neutral countries may notJn present circumstances be safely suspended^     In those circumstances I would propose that the    &apos;Allies should approach the problem from&quot; the other end;i.o, that they snould not seok to determine whatSpecified articles can with abaoluto safety be allowedto be exported to tho Jfiuropoan neutrals without guarantees!out rather what articles it is so essential to keep outof enemy hands that tho fthole complicated system ofmarantaes rationing and licensing masj, be maintained in regard to such articles.  I believe that if a sturdycommon sense is applied to the consideration of thisquestion, a very limited list of articles will emergeand should such be the caso there is no doubt whateverthat the greatest possible benefit will result to thotrade of mis country and a very substantial step willhave been takon to promote that fooling of absonco of  vrestraint and freedom from control which is tho verylife-blood of business.$or
     For the purpose of framing such a definite list ofrestricted articles, I suggest that in the first instancethere should be taken as a basis the British A. list of &apos;prohibited articles, which embraces practically all food-stuffs and most of the principal raw materials.   To this list a few additions will, no doubt have to be made (e,gfRaw Rubber and Cartridges), but I believe they will befound to be very limited m number, asd except possiblyas regards actual Munitions,     My recommendations may therefore, be resumed underthe following heads:-     (l) Having regard to the necessity of revivingtrade with neutral European, countries fee the restrictions which now hedge it round should be removed in regard to as many descriptions of merchandise as possible.     (2)&quot;To achieve this end a list of the articles inrospect of which restrictions must be retained should besubstituted for the present limited list of articles inrespect of which they have been dropped,     (3) This list should be limited if possible toFoods. Raw Materials, and actual munitions of War, and asregards the two former classes should be based on theexisting list of articles, (A) prohibited to all destina-tions,     Further, I suggest that the decision in the abovequestions should apply to countries like Finland, Esthoniaeto., which border on enemy countries and are now. I understand, within the purview of the Inter-Allied BlockadeCommittee,     Exactly to what portions of pre-war Russia theseconditions should apply W5a matter on which guidancewould be needed.   In the other portions of Russia withwhich the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee are concernedtho conditions of trade oould presumably be fixed with-out any reference to Blockade considerations,     I regard this matter as of the most urgentimportance and shall be glad of an early decision.BOARD OF TRADE,     18th January, 1919,A.H.  STANLEY,  18.1.19,
ME.   I have had  the advantage of discussing my proposals with representatives of the various Departments affected.They are strongly  supported by the Treasury and the war trade Department,  but the Departments intimately concernedwith the administration of the blockade such as the Minis-try of  Blockade and the Restriction of Enemyrs SuppliesDepartment, feel grave doubts.   It was pointed out thata decision on the whole matter must be contingent on  inauthorative settlement of the question how far the primary object  of the blockade, (viz.. the prevention of suppliesreaching Germany of any and all goods which might be of use to  her if hostilities were to be resumed)  is to bemaintained in the altered circumstances arising out ofthe armistice.     It was also contended that the blockade would be thechief weapon of the Allies, so far as a weapon was needed in the  future, and that if it were lifted in any consider-able degree it would be difficult to reimpose;  but asregards the latter point, I should suggest that a blockadesuificiently stringent for any eventualities that might arise could be restored without much difficulty.  Farthera modified proposal was brought forward to the effectthat the system set up by the various agreements fullerwhich importing associations like the Netherlands OverseasTrust are bound to prevent supplies reaching the enemy)should be continued while the necessity for obtainingexport  licences except in the case of a limited number or articles should be removed;  in other words, that con-sigament would still be necessary to the ImportingAssociations but the necessity of obtaining licences forexport would disappear.
