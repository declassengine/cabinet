WAR   C1BI.HST,HNAUCIAL PROTISTOH FOB THK GREBE ARMY-------------ggl jgXI7---------       Memorandum by the Treasury,      Certain questions on supplies for the Greek Army during1919 were discussed at a Conference with French,  american and Greek representatives held under the Presidency ofLord Milner in November.   At this Conference the questionof financial assistance was postponed pending informationas to the probable date of demobilisation of the  Greek forces which would determine the amount of money Involved.      Since that time it appears that no military decision has been&apos;taken, and Monsieur Ijenizelos is naturally pressing for a decision as to how he stands financially, the existing agreement having expired on the. last day of 1918.   TheTreasury have made arrangements therefore for a conference with the French Treasury and with representatives of theAmerican Treasury in Paris as early as possible in January, -The task of the Treasury representative will however be almost impossible unless ho can receive instructions from the WarCabinet as to their intentions respecting the future of theGreek: Army and the extent to whioh British interests require a policy of liberality.      The principal points which arise are the following:-  1.  The french General wtaff have a project for embarkingtwo Divisions of the Greek&apos;^rmy to Odessa for use in Russia.The xlrid of financial arrangements whioh are required forthe support of the Greek Army out of its own oountry are quite different from those which are required when it is athome.  Instructions aro asked, therefore, whether the .employment of British credits for the support of two GreekDivisions in Russia is contemplated by the &apos;..;ar Cabinet orwhether it should be made plain in the Financial agreement that so far as British credits are involved, they will notbe available except for the support of the Greek Army inits own territory during- the period of demobilisation.2.The Greeks have expressed themselves as anxiousto demobilise their Army at the earliest possible dateunless the Allies express a particular wish to the con-trary,.   Should therefore the Treasury representative aim at an agreement wM3h provides for the demobilisation ofthe Greek Army as rapidly as possible and for financialassistance merely for. a transitional period, or is Itcontemplated tn.e-t British interests require a substantial part of the Greek Army to bo ke;vfc in being for a periodof a good many, months yet?   The financial  arrangementsappropriate to.a transitional period aro different fromthose necessary for a more prolonged period.  -
  3.  Tho American Treasury has notified disinclinationto to responsible for any share of loans to Greecesubsequent to January lBt, 1919,  The Fronch government believe that under pressure they may modify this attitude.If it is imended to ship tho :)reek Army to Russia it may be anticipated that the United States Government will adhoreto their present attitude.  If, however, the United states treasury could be,,assured that th3 expenditure now oon-templated is only for tho inevit&amp;ole period of demobilisa-tion and can be regarded as a necessary consequence of thewarlike operations now concluded, it is quito liho?.y thauthey will agree to parfcioipdte to the extent of uno -third.Thus, in this respect also the nature of the financialsotthment is largely dependent upon the military decision.      *s an indication of the a proximate amount ofmoney involved, it may be stated that the cost of assistanceto Greece during 1918 has amounted altogether to about 25.000,000, of which t5.000,000 has been found by tneUnited States and the balance of  30,000,000 has been orwill be divided equally between France and this country.During 1918 tho Oreok Army worked up gradually to an establishment of 10 Divisions.TREASURY, S..V/*6th January,  1919,
