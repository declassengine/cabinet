(1)./ raw Afa..22nd January, 1919.My Lord,           1 beg  to  submit the following report on the work  of  thePood Production  Department for the week ended 21st January,  1919;-                 The Weather and Condition of Crops.           The  weather during the past week continued mostunfavourable.    The last two days of the week were drier and coldebut the ground remained so wet that no work on the land waspossible.   Ploughing is now much behind, and threshing has  been delayed.                    LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.           Work  of  Agricultural Executive Committees.           The  Board have of late received representations from several of the Agricultural Executive Committees in the principalmustard growing  counties protesting against the continuance  ofthe restrictions  on the growth of mustard for seed.   In 1916  the acreage in England  and Wales devoted to this crop was 51,907,  -andthis amount was, in  1918 reduced to 9,999 acres.   Prior to  theArmistice  it was  decided to make an Order allowing an area  of20,000 acres for  the harvest of 1919, half of the area to begrown on land  ploughed out of grass for the purpose.   This  order was made on 30th  November.   In view, however, of the improved
situation with regard to the food supply at the present time,department have decided to revoke the Order of 30th November!have removed all restrictions on the use of land  for growing!tard.   There will be a considerable demand for mustard seed jexport after next harvest and the Board think that It  is  in tinational interest that farmers should be freed from therestrictions imposed by the Order.Herefordshire.  Reference was made in the report  for,16thOctober, 1918, to the case of a neglected farm at Bishops Pro;which the owner occupier had Inherited In a very  heavily  mortstate, and which he was without sufficient capital to  farmproperly.   The Committee were then obliged to take possessionthe farm very much against the wish of the owner, but  anarrangement has now been made allowing him to let the  farm tobrother on a 7 years&apos; lease, with the exception of two fieldsalready let to a satisfactory tenantc   The owner&apos;s brother hsufficient capital and experience to work the farm&apos;properly, jthe Committee feel that the interests of food production  are,therefore,safeguarded.Sussex, West.  In October, 1917, the Committee were authorisedto take possession of a badly cultivated farm at  Henfield and let it to an experienced farmer.   A great improvement in the cultivation of the farm has resulted and the Committee are nonrenewing the agreement with the same tenant at about 25%.  increin rent.Prosecutions.  In November 1918 the. Resteven Executive Committwere authorised to prosecute the Trustees of an estate at MortFen known as Bullock,&apos;s Land, for failure to comply with..a cultvation order served upon them by/the Committee.   The  case washeard on the 13th inst. with the result that a fine of  50 and 12. 12, 6. costs was  imposed upon each defendant.
Determination of-Tenancies.  During the week 4 Orders have beenmade by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farmingin respect of 678 acres..                     HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.      &quot;  &apos;Provision of Land for Allotments,  Since.April 30th last, 435 localauthorities have agreed to acquire, under the Cultivation of-LandsOrder, 5,029 acres (63,064 allotments).          During the week ending 17th January, in addition tothe land mentioned above, 17 local authorities have agreed toacquire a further 118 acres, equivalent to 1,381 allotments,including 20 tares at Smethwick.          An area of 90&apos;acres (1,263 allotments) is being ac-quired on lease at Adwick-le-Street (Yorkshire West Riding), underthe Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908.Fruit Section.  Demonstrations have been carried out in pruningapple and plum trees at 4 centres in Norfolk, at which ^altogether100 professional growers were&apos;present.Marketing Section.  In Oxfordshire, which has hitherto beenbackward in regard to the organisation of marketing,, a MarketingExecutive Committee is now being formed and there is a prospect ofa Marketing Society being started at an early date.  The head-&apos;quarters of the Committee will probably be at Banbury, whichwould be very suitable as a centre for marketing operations.          The Committee of the Dorset Marketing Society have beenvisited during the week, and suggestions have been made, for re-organlsation which should lead to an improvement in the workingof the Society.   It is hoped that at an early date the Societywill open auction sales at Poole and Heymouth.Small Live Stock Section.  The Poultry Advisory Committee have formed a Sub-Committee to draft schemes for Education and research in poultry keeping with special reference to schemes of land settle-ment.                           - 3

At the request cf the Department, the ArmyCouncil have issued an instruction to all Commands as to theprocedure t,o be adopted In the demobilisation of these men, so asto avoid causing more inconvenience to farmers than is inevitable in the circumstances.Demob1 Lisation, . The Board have now fceen invited to increase theirallotment of 15,000 pivotal men and additional names  are beingcollected as quickly as possible through the County AgriculturalExecutive Committeep.  All the names have, however, to fce sentto the Department of Demobilisation and Resettlement by the 27thinstant, and in the short time allowed it is unlikely that morethan a further 10,000 to 15,00Q names can be listed,&apos; &apos;         Few of the pivotal men have yet been demobilised, but even if 25,000 such men can be released at once they will no morethan take the places of the.soldiers of Agricultural Companiesnow being demobilised who are returning to their, pre-war occupa-tions, ,: In view of the recently reported ohange in the demobilisation scheme,.the whole.position of agricultural labourha3 been placed before the Cabinet, with a view to the numberof men released immediately for the agricultural industry beingsubstantially Increased.  -   -         The names of IS,053 pivotal men have been sent to theDepartment of&apos; Demobilisation and Resettlement to date.

Advertisements-were inserted.in agricultural andgardening papers, and, as a result, a number of rjuployers have written to the department asking for women,
           The weather Is still preventing many women from  obi employment, particularly those., who could be used on unskilled&apos;working  or&apos; in private gardens.   Arrangements have now been  mad for interchanging women in the English and&apos; Scottish Land Arm!           The&quot;greatest demand is for really skilled women, at requests have been received, for mole catchers and bee keeperj More demands than could&quot;be. satisfied have been received for i thatchersand training isy-therefore, being&apos;arranged in Surf and Bedfordshire.   In the former county,&apos; it is hoped to tral instructress, who will then give instruction wherever needed,                   &quot;  &apos; CULTIVATION DIVISION.        , ,;. Tractor Scheme.   The figures with regard to the provision of tractors, implements, etc-.,. for the- wee.-k ended 18th January i the same as the..previous week, no consignments or withdrawals-having been,made. .  -         Governors have now been distributed to all the For tractors.&apos;                         .  &quot;           During-the week ended 3rd January, .1,271 acres wer ploughed, .4 acres were cross-ploughed and 56 acres cultivate The small acreage covered is. due to the fact that 50$ of the tractors were Idle owing to the weather.  ..    ..

                       SUPPLIES, DIVISION.Basic Blag-   The output of basic slag in  the north-east of Englandand South Wales is being affected by labour difficulties.  Thequestion is receiving the attention of the Ministry of Munitions,,and it does not seem possible for this Department to take any useful action.Lime.   The experimental plant which has been erected at Stoneycombein Devonshire, is now working satisfactorily.   The railwaycompany have agreed to convey ground limestone in bulk from these works, and the necessity cf putting the product into bags., which itwas feared would seriously interfere with the output, has thus beenobviated.Binder Twine.   Scino complaints are still  being received from farmers as to the high prices which are being demanded by makersfor this material,   Makers, however, state that they have no lessthan 8,700 tons of hemp bought at  100 per ton, or twinemanufactured from this high priced hemp, and they are unwilling toreduce the pries to a figure which would involve a material loss.The position at the present moment is that dealers and farmers -generally are holding off buying in the hope of reduced prices.The release of shipping, which has been announced by the ShippingController as from the 1st March; will probably reduce freightsfrom America and allow of importation at prices somewhat below those at.present asked by makers,Germination of English Seed Peas,   Owing to the bad harvestconditions, the germination of English seed peas of the 1313 crop isfound to be below that of a normal season&apos;s crop.   The standardof germination, specified for peas in the Testing of Seeds order is 75 per cent, and a notice is being issued suggesting that, asmuch    of the English crop will not reach this standard, thickersowings of  &apos;seed should be made to avoid failure of crops,
Pivotal Men In the Seed Trade.   A considerable  number  of applications for  the early release of  seed  experts  and  pivotal ;In the Reed Trade have been  considered, and over 500  cases  have submitted to the Demobilisation Department.  Up  to  the  present only a small proportion of this number have been discharged.  /.$the busy season in the Seed  Trade has  now commenced,  seed firms are in urgent need of these  men.See(^ &quot;*ats f or Farmers.    Preliminary purchases have already beer,made In England and Wales of oats for  shipment to France, and ithoped that during the present week, some estimate may be receiveof the probable quantity  obtainable.   Inspectors have  already!located at the ports, and the Royal Commission on  $heat Suppliehave made suitable arrangements for receiving the oat-s, storingrebagging and shipping.Wart Disease.   The district of Lancashire  south of the Ribblebeen certified as an infected area, but the Board have  receivednumber of communications  from local bodies  and individual farme;urging them to permit the planting, under licence,  of susceptiVsecond-early and main-crop varieties of potatoes in non-infecte&apos;land within the area.   The  whole principle on which  the Wart D1of Potatoes Order of 1918 was framed would  be undermined by sue&apos;&apos;concession.   It  is inevitable that in an infected  area someInconvenience should be suffered by those who possess clean lar.there Is ample evidence to show that the extent  of  really cleanIn the area south of the  Pibble is very limited, and-land is ofjassumed to be clean, parts of which, on careful  examination, are found to be infected.   It must also be remembered,  that Lancash&apos;-is by no means above in suffering- from disabilities consequent!the introduction of the Order, for, during  the past season, gro&apos;in Glamorgan have been obliged to plant immune varieties, and,the whole, they hav? complied with the conditions in  a  very
satisfactory way.   It is probable  that there  is  more  clean  landin Glamorgan than in the area south of the  Ribble.   If the spread of wart disease is to be checked without seriously  reducing  theproduction of potatoes, growers must be prepared  for someinconvenience.   The main purpose of the Order is to safeguard the interests of potato culture throughout  England  and Wales.                              I am,                                   V:j Lord,                                       Your obedient Servant,Director-General,he Rt.  Hon.  the Lord Ernie,  President  of the Board of  Agriculture        and  Fisheries.
