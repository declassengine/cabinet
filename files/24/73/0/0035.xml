(l132(This Do-Pro party ofHis JrProposed Telegraph Communications Board.   y&amp;J   Lord i/milner in his memorandum of the 7th December (G,T, K^M&apos;49) and Admiral Fir r;os3lyn ^oivysp. in&quot;&quot;hie ipflmorandum of the  &quot;ilst December last (G,1,6538) recommended the formation of a   Communications board whioh, it is suggested,  should be under   the general charge of the Committee of Imperial X/ofence to   consider and to advise tho Government on all questions of the   Empire1s Telegraphio Communications (cable and wireless)  and it   is proposed that this Board should supersede  the Cables (Landing   Rights) Committee which was sot up in 1899 by tho Board of   Trade as tho Department dealing with landing licences in tho   United &apos;&quot;ingdom and which has hitherto been the advisory body   in ro gar d to sue h mat tors, (i nclud i ng wirelo ss)*  I a m not   aware of any complaints that this Committee,  which contains   representatives of tho same Departments,  as are proposed to   be represented on the new Board, has boon unoqual to its task,  .    but it does not seem to me of great consequence under what   Department tho new advisory body should be, and I acquiesced   a few months ago in a proposal of tho Postmaster General that   the Control of the Cables Committee should pass frcn^Wio   Board of Trade to his Department,        I see no strong objection to the setting up of a   Telegraphic Communications Board and there is a precedent for  .   the suggestion that it should bo under tho aegis of tho   Commit too of Imperial Defence in the appointment by H.II.Govern-   ment in 1914 of a sub-Committoo of that body (the personnel   being practically tho same as that of the Cables (Landing   Rights) Committee) to consider the wireless telegraph Communication-   indications of the Empire as a whole, mainly from the point of   view-of Imperial Defonce.        I am, however,  unable to concur in tho suggestion that   cartain members of the proposed Board,  representing the  lighting   Forces and the General Post Office, should be &quot;permanent member s\   and that others representing the vr?.rfl of Tra^e and certain   other Departments should be &quot;non permanent&quot;.   The matters to be   referred to the Board appear to me to be  of at least as great    importance from tho  financial and commercial points of view as   from that of the Fighting forces, and I soe no justification for   refusing to give all the members an equal.status.tlKLBY,BOARD 01? TRADE,January 10th 1919.
