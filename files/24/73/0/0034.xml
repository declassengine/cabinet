OIL FUEL RESERVE FOR NAVY IN HOME WATERS.

Note by Mr. Long.

I have perused the Admiralty Memorandum, G.T.6594, relative to the oil fuel reserve for Navy in Home waters and fully concur in the proposals contained therein. The lack of adequate stocks of oil caused great anxiety during the war and it was abundantly demonstrated that the policy of storing large stocks of oil in this country is a vital necessity.
