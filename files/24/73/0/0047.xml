THE CHAIRLAN colled tho attention of the Committee toOFFICERS,    tho fact that Paper G.T*6592, containing tho Committee&apos;a            recommendations as to gratuities to officers, had boon            submitted to the Cabinet the day before, and ho said that            tho Prime Hint at or had suggested that those rpco^menc-ations           .should first bo submitted to Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig            for his approval.  Tir* Forotor had proceeded to Franco in            order to consult Sir Douglas Haig on tho matter.               THE COT&apos;1 ITTEE decided                   That no further action in tho natter vas necessary,                   provided that Sir Douglas Haig agreed to the                   recom endations of the Committee,

THE CHAIRMAN,  with reference  to  the  42nd  looting,pATIOM       Uinuto 7,  raised  the question  as  to wether  the  sup-tO&quot;ANQI? TO     plcmontary allowance of  6/6d should bo  granted to un-UiLFlSS hlVESJ  married wives  who were not earning  wages.  They  had to              decide whether an unnarriod wife  should ho treated as              a wife or  as n dependent.                 lit&apos;.  &quot;MAT HEW,  the  Chairman of  the -  Special  Grants              Committee, sain that the unmarried  wives formed  a class              of  their.own,  namely, Class B,Dependents.  Parliament              had decided that  Class h^Dependents,  having  a proved              domestic basis,  should be  treated in the same way as              wives.  In reply  to  Sir  Charles  Karris,  who  suggested              eraot tho unmarried wife  was first admitted to separation              allowance  on the  ground  of thai r  being  children, Mr.              ttattoetr  said that he understood that  it  was  not  a              question of children, hut  of the  existence of a  home,              which gave the necessary qualification.  Generally,              local committees  had treated the  unmarried wife  in the              same way as the married  wife.  If she was not treated              as  a Class B Dependent,  Regulation  7  (l)d would  lapse,              and she would  have to be treated  as e. dependent.                 SIR CHARLES HAThTS repeated his  statement that in            &apos;  1914 the children had formed the  determining consider-              ation.                 SIR ARTHUR  BOSCAWEN said that  the  Minister of Pensions              and he himself thought that the unmarried wife should be              treated in this case, as in the  case  of  the  ordinary sep-              a ration allowance, just  like a married  wife.                 THE COMMITTEE  agreed  that:-                    Por  the  purpose of the supplementary separation                    allowance of 6/6 per week,  granted to  childless                    wives who were not earning  wages,  an umarried                    wife should be treated in  exactly the  same^way                    as a married wife,                 MAJOR BAIRD left  at this point.              4.  THE CHAIRMAN,  with reference  to  the  42nd  Meeting,              Minute 9,read  the Admiralty Memorandum  (Paper No * 116),              which contained proposals  for  the increase in the scale              of  ordinary pensions to  Naval  Officers7  widows,  fie said              that two further  &apos; omoranda had now  been circulated, one              by  the i!ar Office (No. 118)  and one  by the Ministry of              Pensions (No,119).  The  bar Office  Memorandum suggested              that if an increase  was  to be  given at  all,  it should be              given first on the pensions of officers  (or  their depend-              onts)  who  had  been disabled, or had lost their lives in              the war.   The  Ministry of  Pensions  appeared  to agree with              this view.                 SIR ARTHUR  BOSC AY/EN said that  he thought  they were              beginning  at the  wrong end.  They had not yet considered              the question of a par bonus on the  disablement pensions              of  officers: that should be done  first  of all.   &amp;xk ChAaLES HARRIS agr: ed with Sir A.u--,Bo:.;c:uonthat the question raised by the admiralty could on?as part of a larger questionThey worebe consider Co. aproposing to raj se the pensions of thf wieows VJ. UJ.- i.wi-awho had morel?/- done their ordinary service, whale ro-Uungwas being done to increase the service pensions of postmenand other classes who had themselves fully earned their pensions,
           MR.:P0B&apos;^T8 said that this raised the whole question      of service and disablement pensions of all classes of      Government workers, civil and military.           THIS COMMIT^ decided:...                (a)  That further discussion of this matter be                    adjourned.                (b)  That it was important that the whole question                    of increases in all Government pensions of                    whatever kind, Hnvnl, military and Civil                     should be examined on o comprehensive basis.           C&apos;JR ARTHUR B0&apos;-0A!&apos;&apos;PJ undertook that the ministry of                Pensions should briny forward proposals in the                matter of a war bonus on officers&apos; disablement                pensions 1           0IR ARTH R BOSCA&apos; &apos;W left at this point.IIMITM RATE  5.  THT5 CHAIRMAN referred to a letter from .r.Ap, leton,f PAY IN   Secretary to the General Federation of Trade Unions, toIE. ARMY.   Lord  liner, and Lord ;;milner&apos;s reply.   He understood          that the var&apos;Cabinet had agreed that there should be a          minimum rate of pay for the Army of l/6d a day, but from          these letters  it would appear that a man was credited          with his pay,  and Proficiency Pay Class P, and if these          did not amount to the minimum, he was granted allowances          which brought  his pay up to l/6d a day.   It appeared          from this as though the &quot;ar Office still adhered to a          basic&apos;rate of  l/- a day.   The matter had also arisen          in correspondence between Colonel &apos; ilson and i- r. Apple ton          and the latter appeared to think that the men were          receiving 3d a day less than they should have.              SIR CFARLT3S HARRIS said that it had been agreed by          the Committee  end by the &quot;ar Cabinet that Class 2 Pro-          efficiency Pay should be merged in the l/6d minimum.          The mranwho received Proficiency Pay Class 1 obtained a          minimum of l/9d a day.   The only case in which a man          received less  than l/6d as a basic rate was v;hen he was          in hospital through his own fault.              SIR CH-RLUS HARRIS undertook to look into the                question raised in Mr. Appleton&apos;s letter to                Colonel  Wilson and to frame a reply. JS OF     6.  TWt CHAIR^AH said that he had suggested to the Prime TO THE   Minister that  an announcement should be made in the f, NAVY   Press to the effect that the question of future rates of AIR      pay to the Army was under consideration.   An announce- CE.       mont had already been made by the Admiralty.              SIR CFARLPS H-RRIS said that he was strongly opposed          to this matter being pressed to a settlement now.   If          rates of pay were fixed now while all industrial values          are false, they could only be put at an absolute          maximum, and the cost of the individual soldier          would inevitably have weight - determining the number          of men that could bo maintained on the estimates.         - In three months&apos; time the v&apos;ar Office would be in a          better position to go into this question.   At present          they had received no intimation that the Cabinet desired          the Committee  to take the matter up.              .MB.  ROBERTS said that the Army end Navy could not          be kept up on  pre-war rates of pay..   The Services would          have to be made attractive if they wanted to get men.          He thought the matter was of immediate Importance, but          would prefer/
-A-prefer to see a Committee corripar^s4.r^re7Te^entai^iveB ofthe two Houses of Parliament and of Labour dealing wi-th,this matter.     m, BLAND said that the Air Ministry also had not received an intimation that the &quot;ar Cabinet desired theCommittee to deal with this question;  but under anarrangement made when the Air Force was first instituteed) a Committee had been set up which, was looking intothe question of the relative rates of pay in the AirService..     THF COIllITTftJS agreed:-           That the question of the future rates of pay           of the Navy, Army and Air Force required           Immediate examination     THF CHAIRMAN undertook to send a formal intimation           to the Army Council and the Air Council that           the &quot;ar Cabinet desired the Committee to           consider this question.EATUITIFS TO 7.   THT&apos; CHAIRMAN, with reference to the 42nd Meeting,HRANT OFFIGFRS Minute 11, saidTTY OFFICERS, ly increments to5,0 !s AND f.IFNthat itthe warTHE NAVY,ARM,DAIR FORCF.                         had been decided that the month-                                    of r&apos;v,TTQ.nt Officers,Petty Officers, N.C.0fs and men of the Navy, Army andAir Force who were in receipt of service pension and payconcurrently should be half the increments received by those who were not in receipt of service pension and pay.   Dr. Iviacnamara had suggested that as the principle was held that a manTs pensions was earned, this pointof view could not be adhered tot     W.I&apos;.!ACNAIiARA said that this question had been.settled for the Army and the Favy, but he wished tore-open it.   At the beginning of the war the admiralty had ,decided not to pay a man his pension&apos;while in re-ceipt of pay, but this had aroused so much resentmentthat on October the 1st,1918, the Admiralty had been compelled to grant these men the whole of their pensionfrom the date at which they became time-expired. GRATUITIESI SEAI.IFN AND     SIR CHARLFS HARRIS said that the Admiralty was In-consistent in that it did not treat its officers in thesame way as it was proposing to treat the mene   It was,however, a matter that concerned the Army even morethan the Navy, and he would be glad if a final decision was not taken until i&apos;.r, Forster could be present.     TH?:&apos; COMIIITTEE agreed:-          That this question should be adjourned until          the Financial Secretary to the &quot; ar Office was          able to attend and ^tve his views, -8,   DR. iIACNAJ&apos;ARA, with reference to Paper Ho,120, saidthat men bf the Royal Naval Reserve, like other men of  &apos;the Navy, Army and Air Force, would receive on demobili-sation the war gratuity under G/f.6286:  this being in lieu of the service gratuity of 30 days1 pay to whichthey had previously been entitled.   Ho understood, now that in addition to forfeiting the original gratuityof 30 days1 pay the amount of this gratuity was alsodeducted from the gratuity to which they were entitled under G.T.62S6.   He thought this had never been Intended.
TUITH.SDENTAL&apos;GE01JS,ONEL     It was pointed out, however, that these men stillroo&amp;ived their&apos;-original gratuity of 30 days1 pay on demobilisation;  and that was why the war gratuity towhich they were entitled under G.T.6286 was abated bytho amount of tho original gratuity.9.   I)R.&apos;*AGHAMARA raised tho question of war gratuities to dental surgeons-;   Theso officers received&apos;speclolrates of pay, and tho war gratuities could not be assessed on those rates.     SIB G*?\RI/SS HARRIS said that dental surgeons inthe Army served under s. octal contract, end theTreasury held that th.;y wore not entitled to receive a vs.tr gratuity,     THE CO^/JTT^F decided:-          That Sir Charles Harris, far. V:ulker, and for.          Bland should discuss this matter;  which          should be brought up before, the Committee          at a later date.           10.  THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that this was the  lost           Meeting that Colonel Wilson would attend as Secretary.IVICES AS   He thought that the thanks of tho Committee should beRTARY TO  recorded for the services which Colonel Wilson had CON- ITTEE.rendered,     All the members of the Committee associated themselves most warmly with the Chairman&apos;s proposal.     THTii COri.:ITT :e decided:-     That their  thanks to Colonel Wilson and     their appreciation of his services should be     -placed on record in the following terms:-     &quot;That our best thanks be tendered to Colonelv:ilson for his efficient services as Secretaryof the Co mittee:  and wo express regret that other duties necessitate his severance from our work&quot;.1 2 Whitehall Gardens,       .9th January 1919.
