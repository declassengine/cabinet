Attention to water-oourses and fvrrows has cleared the stronger land of water and very little requires draining,           With the exception of 10 aareo of wfcsrt the rest (224 aores) looks promising, but that sown after t,irf will need early rolling, Tho 90 acros of Winter Oats could not look better and early sowing shews to advantage.   54 acres of beans have been planted and leek remarkably well but being sown on rather foul stubbles will ne$d cleaning.                         horses are in use, many of the camp horses being turned&apos;out.   Ploughing steadily continues with a  aw1, but the ifiarting and distribution of slag, lime and fluo-dust together with considerable swede oarting keeps the remainder very *uaye           The swedes have all been pulled, topped and carted to  the yards, or clamped in the fields.   The men are now fairly evenly distributed between the stock,  manures, planting beet and laying and grubbing hedges, and in a month or two from now most of the fields will be in good order.

The Monthly Agricultural Report estimator , that aboutI three-fourths of the area intended for wheat has already  been sown.I The area  seems at present to bo  rather less than at the  same date  last year, but the season is rather more backward, so that noS  tendency  is apparent towards a reduction in the wheat area.   It is  expected  that rather more labour than usual will be required to  prepare the land for green crops next Bpring. &apos;cultural Wages Board.  The tenth  issue of the Wag ft B Board  Gazette  appeared  on the 3rd January.  -            During tha week ICQ oases  of complain of non-payment tf  the minimum rates were  received,  the largest numbers in  individual  counties  being 16 in the case of Hampshire, 15  in Oxfordshire, 1-1  in .S3sex  and 13 in Nottinghamshire.   35 oases were sent  to  Inspector?  for visit, enquiries by correspondence were made in 300  oases, 26  cases  were coinplete4, and reports were reoeived from Inspectors in  6 oases.            A meeting oX  tJw &quot;Farming  Costs  and  Cost of Living  Committee&quot; was held on  the 7th  inst.                 Tithe, Commons,  Copyhold  and  Survey Branch,            During the past week a considerable  number of  enquiries  have been received as to the prooedure under the Tithe Aot, 1918,  but tho number of applications for redemption ma do has not exoeedod  the normal. ,            Tho Board have requested the Local Oovornment  Board to  bring  to  the notice of  Local Authorities the provisions  of Section 1  of the Tithe Aot, 1878, which requires that whon land has been  taken  for places of worship, cemeteries, schools Under tho  Elementary Education Acts, town-halls, oourt-houses, ^   aols,  lunatic asylums, hospitals, or any other public buildings, or under  the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890;  or for sewage farms  under  tho Sanitary Acts, or for  tho  construction of any  sewers or  sewage works, or any gas or waterworks,  or for enlarging  or  improving premises used for any  of the above-mentioned purposes, the  titho  rent charge charged on tho  land shall be redeemed and that  the application shall be made by the persons proposing to carry out  any of the above-mentioned works before the land 1B applied to  any of the purposes aforesaid.   It is believed that 8 large proportion  af the land acquired by Looal Authorities  oomes under the provisions  of this Section, and that in many cases Local Authorities have  omitted to take tho necessary steps for  redemption.   Probably, in  some instances tha emission may  have been  due to tho fact that, prior  to the passing of the Tithe Act  of last  Session, tithe rontcharge  was not as a rule redeemable at  IQBS than  twenty-five years&apos;  purchase  sf its par valufl.            The revised scale of compensation for the Bnfranchisement  of Copyhold Lands is now operating.   Its  effect will be  substantially  to reduce the amount of compensation for enfranchisement.            Joint Committee of Board of.Agriculture and                        Ministry of good.            The oorrospondenoe during  the  past week reteals  considerable misgivings as to the early  demobilisation of certain  olaaeascf agriculturists in the  Army in  accordance with  promise.            Tho general baokward condition of farm work throughout the  country suggosts tho urgent need for returning  skilled men to the
land with the least possible delay.         The diffioulty in finding a market for Wheat and Potatoesat the fixed prices is also oausing considerable dlssatisfaotion,particularly in regard to potatoes, whioh,  aooording to reportBreoeivod by the Joint Committee are rapidly deteriorating in many areas.
