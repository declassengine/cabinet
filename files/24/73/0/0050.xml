G.H.Q,.Eastern Section.       -                   fth January,  1919                           NOTE       CONCERNING RUSSIAN PRISONERS INTERIM!) IN GERMANY *        Reply to communication received from General du Cane            under date 30th December, lOlB,        Information has been received from General Dupont,  (l)to tho effect that Russian officers repatriated from Germanyaredmmediately shot, or forcibly incorporated in the Red Army,Rank and file receive similar treatment.   As stated in theBritish Note, the direct repatriation of Russian P/f,s. via thewestern frontier therefore entails a two-fold danger.        l]  That of dooming anti-Bolshevik p/w.8./massacre.        2)  Supplying the Red Army with considerable reinforce-           ments.   These dangers must be avaided.            The Allies owe it to humanity to safeguard the           existence of the soldiers who have fought in their           cause,          -  It is moreover to their interest to protect these men           from the grip of Bolshevism.        This may be effected as follows :         l)   By improving the moral and material condition  of             Russian P/W, s.         2)   By repatriating them to territories free from  the             Soviet regime.         1)   Improvement of moral and, material condition^t^v/^e^        Immediate measures can and should be taken to ensurethe following:        Regular supplies of food,        Adequate care of the sick.        Suitable accommodation.        These P/W.B, should be given priority of the food supplies to be furnished to Germany bjr the Allies.        In the meantime, Germany should be compelled to providethe following:        Necessary food and clothing        Adequate treatment of the sick        Reorganisation.of P/W, Camps, with a view to improvementof sanitary conditions;        An Allied Control for the distribution of fead and organisation of hygienic conditions should be establishedwithout delay.(l)  Prench delegate in Berlin for the repatriation of FrenchP/W.s,
         2) Repatriation of prisoners.         This question should be approached with all reserve, taking into account the possibilities of transport,  and the preliminary evacuation of Serbian, Greek and Roumanian prisoners, which is already taking place.   The incernal condition of Russia, and the wishes of the prisoners should moreover be considered.        &apos; It ie therefore bbviotis that this operation cannot be immediately carried out, and that for the moment,  all aotion in this direction is of a preparatory nature.         Owing to the reasons wkove, repatriation via the Eastern frontier should be discontinued.         Preparations for repatriating prisoners to  the following districts may be commenced         PolantL on the one hand;         Southern Russia on the other, (l)         All Russian p/w.s. not oontaminated by Bolshevism, and capable 6f constituting reinforcements to the  party,faith- ful to our cause, should be directed on these districts.         The organisation of this double stream of  repatriation wiW: necessitate a preliminary division of the prisoners,  and their allocation to camps established along the routes.         Repatriation is, however,  dependent in the  first place on the constitution in Poland of local forces sufficiently strong to offer effective opposition to Bolshevism,  and in the second place, on the preliminary evacuation of  Serbian, Greek and Roumanian P/W,8. by the same route.                              *         Allied intervention in favour of Russian P/w\s.- consequently comprises;         Immediate measures:         Improvement of conditions of life:         Preparations for repatriation.         Future measurecr:         ExucutlUaa  of repatriation.         The essential condition for carrying out this programme with rapidity and success, is the organisation in  Berlin of a Directing Committee, which might be-composed of military representatives of the Allied Powers, delegated to  act in the interests of the P/W/b.   This Committee Bhould be completed by the necessary additional personnel (interpreters,    (l)  Siberia is too distant, and Northern, Russia (Arohangsl -Murmansk) is inaccessible in winter.   The Baltic Pr6vinces are threatened by a speedy Invasion by the Red Army
medical personnel,  etc.)  and empowered to  direct  and co-ordinate the activities of the Red Cross Associations  and various Aid Societies,  and, in the name of the  Allies,  to notify the competent German Services of instructions relative to the organization of  camps and transport of  supplies, and  the grouping of P/Wt$,  for  repatriation.        Should the  &apos;above, proposal meet with the approval  ofthe Allied Governments, instructions to this effect will  be conveyed to the Armistice Committee at Spa.        The present Note has been communicated to the  TrenchGovernment.(Signed)   J.  FOCH.
