Chairman.                             The Finance Member.     Che  Adjutant-General,  the Adjutant-General  (France),  the  Assistant  FinancialSecretary, the Director of Personal Services;  Secretary, Mr. Paterson (F. 2).  the deputy  Chief of the Imperial General  Staff,  the Director-General of  movements and Railways, the Quartermaster,-General (France), and Mr. Campbell of the Ministryof Labour, were present during part of the deliberations of the Committee.     The Committee appointed to consider the extra emoluments of the Army of Occu- pation submit their report.     1. We considered two alternative methods :      (a.) A special bonus or bounty payable to the individual at short intervals.     (b.)  A percentage increase of all pay emoluments of the Army as laid down in  the           Eoyal Warrant.     2. The Military Members of the Committee advocated (6), and as we were unable to come to agreement, the matter was submitted for your decision.     3. After hearing the arguments you decided  that the emolument should take  the form of a bonus at rates uniform in  the different arms of  the service, with a moderate graduation for rank.     4. On this basis we recommend the  following weekly additions to the emoluments. of soldiers of all arms of the ranks specified below.   It is necessary for  administrative reasons that  the weekly amount should be easily divisible by 7.; but we recommend that the addition should not be announced as an increase to daily pay.                   Rank                   Weekly addition.       Private    ............   10s. 6d. (Is. Qd. a day).       Paid lance-corporal,  2nd  corporal, 1       d  (U 9d a day).         Corporal.                       j          v          J&apos;       Paid lance-serjeant, serjeant    ...   14$. (2s. a day).       C^rlt oCe^nse^ea&quot; ^j1^6d- ^ u a da^-                 &apos;       Warrant officer, Class 1.......   21s. (3s. a day).     While this bonus is intended  as  a solatium  for  those  whose  hopes of early demobilization have to be disappointed, it is  felt necessary to extend it to the Regular Army, otherwise grave discontent would arise.     5. Men on special rates  of pay, such as the motor  driver at 6s. a day, should not receive these  additions, but should be given the option of coming on to the &quot; ordinary&quot; rates and conditions where more favourable.     6. After discussion, we have arrived at the  conclusion that the numbers (including the Pk,egular Army) who will be  eligible for this additional emolument may be taken as averaging some 1,200,000, supposing the occupation of Germany to continue throughout the  year.  On.this basis, the cost of the proposal would be roughly 34 millions for 12 months.     7. The question of the mode and date  of bringing the payments into operation presents difficulty.   If each individual  told off for  retention  is to draw the  new emolument from the date on which he is so informed, and  if that  process begins very shortly, there will for a considerable time be in the ranks of the same units a very large     (B19/67) 50 1/19  H&amp;S  6773wo
 number  of  men  (nearly two millions  to start with) who will  not receive  the  bonus, though for the time being they are not demobilized.  It appears to us doubtful whether this may not give rise to further unrest on a considerable scaie.     [f, on the other hand,  the bonus were given to all men in the army after a certain date, the men told olf for definite  retention might complain that they  were being treated  no  better  than the rest.   The fact that the  two grievances are  logically inconsistent  will not  prevent  those interested  from pressing both  of them.   We recommend  that before a final decision is taken on this point, the opinion of officers  in actual touch with troops should be ascertained, provided that no delay is caused thereby.     8.  Our estimate in paragraph  6 assumes that payment will  be made only to those told off.   To make payment to all in  the  Army as from  1st  February would add some 8 millions to the estimate.     9. There are two special grievances in the Army at present, which require to be dealt with      (a.) The state of the French railways suggests that the present excessive hours  of           work of the drivers and other crews of trains will continue for a long time;           and  this invites most unfavourable comparisons with the 48-hour week just           arranged for railway men of all grades at home.     (b.)  Soldier mechanics  and other soldiers employed on salvage and  repairing work           have got it into their heads that they are being &quot; sweated,&quot; not for the sake           of victory in the field but for  the  commercial  exploitation  of markets for           the sale of surplus Army vehicles and stores.     With these questions we will deal in  a further report.     10.  Meanwhile, we consider it most important that the true state  of the soldiers&apos; emoluments should be  fully explained, not only to  the  men themselves,  but to the widest possible public through the medium of the Press.     11.  In the above figures we have included nothing for  the  effect upon the emolu- ments of the Air Force, but we assume that they will follow the same lines as the  Army.     12.  The numbers for the British Army in India are  included, but for lack  of the necessary time we have not been able to  communicate with  the  India Office, or to approach  the question whether any  corresponding increase  for  the Indian  troops retained in Armies of Occupation will be found necessary. ;    13.  For the officers retained for  the Army  of Occupation  we  recommend  the following scale, based upon  the same  principle as for lower ranks :                                  Weekly addition.           2nd Lieutenant            ...    ...   24s. 6d. (3s. 6d. a day).Lieutenant,  ...CaptainMajor  ...Lieutenant-Colonel28s. (4s. a day).31s. 6d (4s. 6d. a day).35s. (5s. a day).38s. 6d (5s. 6d. a day).     14. For Colonels and General Officers the question is  almost  entirely one affectingthe permanent officers of the regular Army.     In these circumstances we  desire to leave the question whether full Colonels andGeneral Officers should receive the new emolument, to your decision.   If it  is given weare agreed that it  should  be  at  a flat  rate of 42s.  a  week for  all ranks aboveLieutenant-Colonel.     15. The cost for officers is estimated at about 3f millions.     16. The proposals outlined above will have  important consequential  effects uponthe Navy.                                   Signed  on behalf of the Committee,                                                             H. W. FOESTEE.   20th January,  1919.
                         NOTE BY  SIR CHARLES HARRIS.     During the war, the regular officer has received the following pecuniary advantages in addition to his peaoe-time emoluments :      (a.) nations in accordance with regulation for all &quot;in the field,&quot; including home as           well as abroad.     (6.) In theatres of war, continuous issue of field, lodging, fuel and light allowances.           The general result of this has been that officers in theatres of war have been           able to live on their rations and field allowances without touching their pay,           while their lodging allowances have been  available for their families.     (c.) Allowance for  children at  the rate of 24d. a  year  for each  child up to           a maximum  of 96l, for ranks below Major, and half rates for Majors.     (d.) Eaising  of the pay of the 2nd Lieutenant,  including the  lad from Woolwich           and Sandhurst as well as the officer from the ranks, to a  minimum of           10s. Qd., with smaller improvements in the pay of Captains and Majors.     (e.) Grants from the Civil Liabilities Committee, in cases of hardship.     (/) Income tax chargeable on military income at the old rates.     It should also be noted that, until the statutory end of  the  war is reached, officerscontinue to reckon increments (at ll, 21 or Si a month, according to rank)  to their war  gratuity.     In  my opinion the arguments  for adding the proposed new  emolument to the waremoluments of the Kegular Army have little force when applied to the regular officer,in view  of the above;  and practically none when applied to the General officer.     About half the cost referred to in paragraph 15 arises on Regular officers.C. HAEEIS.
