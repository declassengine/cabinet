Durin,- the war an extensive system of ground wireless stations, coastal and&apos;inland, manned and equipped by the Royal  AirForce, has been built up, and this system should be of  great value for&apos;commercial flying In peace time,*     A system of high power transmitting ground stations for usein connection with Aerial Navigation has also been established.It Will be necessary to maintain this and to  select suitable sites for stations throughout the &quot;moire.!,, in order to meet the necessi-ti s of long distance commercial flights, the success of which-fnust largely depend upon direction-! wireless and reliablemeteorological reports promptly.transmitted.   These sites shouldbe carefully selected so as also to provide for the proposedImperial Ne*,rs Service and establish a chain of British  wireless stations throughout the world.     This rork falls, pro; erly within the province of theproposed Communications Board and pending&apos;the formation of this body it is suggested that the activit:f&apos;,e,s&apos;;-Of other committees in the srvme direction should be suspended.-     It is. considered that the  formation,/of the CommunicationsBoard is a matter of ajgfeggjg inm?UU$t).))))))))))))))
