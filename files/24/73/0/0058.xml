665 8   )W/TSTATIONS in HOI-LAND m JWA.(1)    It is understood that  discussions  took place beforethe War between the Marconi Company  and the  Dutch Govern-ment vdth a view to installing powerful W/T  Stations  in holland and Java for direct inter-oorariini cation,  and  thatthese discussions are now being resumed.(3)   The Dutch Press has definitely announced  that the contracts for the erection of these  stations have beengiven to the German Telefunken Company.   These stations are to be similar to those at Nauen,  and the interest in,and control of them will be entirely German.(3)   The Marconi Company have, through their Dutch agents,made great efforts to secure the contract, but  without success;  but there is a party in Holland which is stronglyanti-German and roost unwilling to see this important  lineof communication under German&quot;control.(4)   It is obviously undesirable that Germany  should beallowed to have the control over such a line of eoiwiunica-tion, and, if the control is to be in the hands of aprivate Company, it i&apos;s equally obviously desirable thatthat Company should be a British one.(5)   It is believed to be a fact that the GermanTelefunken Company is not in a position to fulfil the contract, and it is therefore urged that the BritishGovernment should take up this question with the dutch government as quickly as possible vdth a view to obtain-ing a contract for a British Company.(Sgd)   R.  12.
