PROGRESS OF FARM WORK.

The weather of the week was unfavourable for out-door farm work. The pulling and storing of turnips has been retarded by the sodden condition of the ground. Ploughing is being proceeded with in the lighter and drier districts. Wheat sown in October and November is doing well, and so too are catch crops, especially where sown in good time in the autumn.

Reports from a few counties indicate that potatoes are sprouting considerably in pits and from some districts complaints as to rotting of tubors in pits are also being made. In other counties however, no serious damage has yet been noticed.

The outlook as to fodder and feeding stuffs for battle is much more favourable than was the case last year,  the mildness of the season up to the present making for economy in the use of those ?onds.
