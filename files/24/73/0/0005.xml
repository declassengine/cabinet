(This Document Is thG r*roj36rty of   1 fi(2    SECRET.                                 5th January,  19191O  T            E307T3I0U OP ElABfiBQ FOB MEN MD WCSCT.WtTtt        Memorandum for tho far Cabinet by Sir Erie Gedde3.1.        This subject is discussed in two  papers  by Sir  Stephenson     Kent, the first on the training of men (3)oG*4l)  has  already     been circulated to the War Cabinet and the second  dated  23rd     December, 1918, on the subject of training for  Women is     attached. 2.       The question is important from many aspects,  and     particularly because (a)  many men previously  skilled have     lost their skill through  disablement:    (b) many people,     now unskilled,  may be necessary to fill and reinforce the     ranks of skilled men in order to obtain sufficient pro-     duotion;   (c)   apprentices whose training was  interrupted     by the War must have it provided for them now in an  intensi-     fied form, or under exceptional conditions-.   and  (d) in     the case of large numbers of women now unemployed  through     the cessation of the War  a special opportunity  exists for     training them in household duties and the care  of  children. 3.       The cases requiring  consideration fall  into the     following categories                         - 1 -
Men.-Women1.   Ex-Officers.B.   Discharged soldiers.3.   Invalid soldiors in hospitals.4.   Disabled soldiers.5.   Serving soldiers and sailors.6.   Discharged civil war workers.7.  Discharged Service women8.  Discharged v/omen civil      war workers.         In the case of categories 6, 7 and fl, the problem is (a)whether the State should provide such training: and if so (b)what Bopartmont should be responsible.     In the case of all theother categories the only question is:    Which Department of theState should undertake the training which everyone agrees mustbe provided?4*  EX-OFFICERS.-         The emergency of ex-Officers is in the hands of a branch of the Demobilisation Department of the Ministry ofLabour, called the Appointments Committee, specially set up todeal with- this matter.    The class of training involved is largelyprofessional or special in character.     Closo touch is being keptwith the Board of Education in framing schemes of training.It is thought that this Section should continue to be controlledas at present.5.  DISCHARGED SOLDIERS.-  including those whose period of apprentice-ship has been broken.fa)  Those who wish to engage in Agriculture are trained underthe arrangements of the Board of Agriculture.   It would be pru-dent to continue this system.(b)  In the case of those who desire to be employed in industrialwork, a case could be made for placing the responsibility oftraining upon any one of the three following Departments:-     1*   The Board of Education, because it involves an          extension of the technical training which they          already provide.     2.   The Ministry of Pensions, because they are providing          training for disabled  soldiers.
      3*    The Ministry.of labour, because they are already,             through the Deportment of Demobilisation and Re-             settlement, performing this duty in relation to             discharged soldiers.      In deciding this question it is important to keep inmind  that  the Trade Unions are vitally concerned in the system,and amount of training which should be recognised as adequate,and that the arrangements to be made must he constantlynegotiated with them.      This  seems to constitute an overwhelming reason why theresponsibility should be placed upon the Ministry of Labour,which is most closely in touoh with these organisations.  Itis thought,  however, that the Deportment of Demobilisationis already overburdened with work, and that a separate TrainingSection should be set up,in the Ministry of Labour to whichthe expert staff of the Demobilisation Department, which hasbeen  dealing with this question, should be transferred.DISABLED SpEPPaRS.-        *      These at present are receiving training under the auspices of the Ministry of Pensions, who have the statutory duty ofmaking payment of certain pensions during the course of train-ing.   It is felt, however, that the necessity of having uni-formity of system and administration makes it essential thatone authority only should be charged with industrial training,and that such powers and functions as the Ministry of Pensionsat present exercise in regard to training should be transferredto the Ministry of labour, and performed by the Section already suggested.iTOJJJ) SCTu DISKS J&amp;JOaPITALS, -------------------,--------rrts-O&quot;----------      In this case/the training should be provided by theMinistry of Labour.   In reapeot, however, that such men arestill under the control of the War Office, it would be nscess-ary to allow the military authorities powers of inspection
 and approval - from  a medical and disciplinary and administrative point  of view. ggRTIHG SOLDIER3 AND  SAILORS. -     The circumstances  of  this case make it essential that the training should  be provided by the Navy and the Army.   On the other  hand, it is  equally  necessary that a uniform standard with civil training should be maintained if it is to be made acceptable to the  Trade Unions, and it is recommended that the Ministry of Labour should  determine the course and system of training which the Services are to follow, so that proper co-ordination may  be  effected such as would allow a man to continue his training after discharge. DISCHARGED MALE  CIVIL WAR  WORKERS.-     The provision of the  training in this case would naturally fall upon the Ministry  of  Labour;   but there is a question as to  whether any such provision should be made at the present time.    There would be little use training unskilled workers for jobs which the Unions  might never allow them to take up. The solution of  the difficulty depends entirely on the line of  action which  is taken on the proposed War Pledges Bill. The leading Trade  Unions concerned refuse to discuss what is to be  done  in relation to the Dilutees of industry until the War Pledges  Bill has been passed into law.   Accordingly, it is recommended that the  earliest possible action should be taken for this purpose in the new Parliament. DISCHARGED SERVICE WQ.M.-   DISCHARGED WOMEN CIVIL WAR WORKERS     These olasses are also dependent on the passage of theIfar  Pledges Bill,  and the  subsequent  discussions with TradeUnions, because until then it will be impossible to determine for what  Trades women should be trained.     There are, however, at the present time 164,000 dischargedwomon without  employment,  and the  number  is likely to increase.
5.1.19. It may be expedient - and clamour may make it necessary - that something should be done to prevent deplorable results arising fron such conditions.   Sir Stophenson Kent suggests,  as a email measure, that thi3 opportunity should be taken to afford training in household duties and the upbringing of children to those of them who axe engaged to be married and those  whomarried during the War.    There are certain hostels and national factories which could readily be adapted for  thispurpose.   He suggests that the women who aocept this  training should receive 85/- per  week,  and that the period spent on itshould not be counted in the 13 weeks in which they areentitled to unemployment donation.     he period of trainingwould be three months.     This proposal is strongly supported by the Women1sTrades Council.                        (Signed)  Eric Geddes.
SIR ERIC GHDBBS.UNEMPLOYMENT OF demobilised       WAR WORKERS,   PROPOSED SCHEME -OF TRAINING IK HOUSE&quot;      HOU) MANAGEMENT &amp; DOMESTIC SCIENCE.        I  dasire  to  oall  your attention  to  the grave unrest whioh oxists  at tho present moment among woman munition workers who are aware that discharges aretaking place in groat- numbers and that tjtore is  no prosont probability of finding work for more than &amp; small proportion of those who have been dismissed.  The position is that nearly 1$ million women are dirootly  roplaoing men in commerce and industry.  Owing to  the existing deadlock in respect of the war pledges they must all sooner or later  be dismissed, and room must be found  for them,  if it oan be found at all, within the boundaries of the  trades whioh wore earmarked as women1e trades boforo the war. As far  as can be  seen at present fow of those trades, on aooount as a rule  of the lack  of raw materials, can absorb even their 1914 complement of workers, let alone afford relief to tho additional ij million women and girls who have entered trade and. industry since that date.  In tho  caao  of cotton, a trade which might have boen oxpocted  to oxpand  and give employment to  largo numbers ccS these supernum&amp;ry workers, the raw material is believod to exist, but the position  is complicated  by tho roluotanoo  of buyers to buy at the top of a falling market.        Tho situation has boon carefully considered by tho Demobilisation and  Resettlement Department in conjunction with the Advisory  Committons of the chief Trades Unions omploying women.   I attach  a memorandum prepared, by the Department and the following policy  is  now put forward for sanction.   The Department thinks it desirable  that the  largo class of women who intend to marry soldiers and sailers whon  the troops return,  or to sottlo down for the first time with  their husbands, should if possible be  removed from industry for the prasont.  It therefore proposes to train these women in housewifery, infant welfaro and similar subjects,  knowledge of whichwill presumably be  of-use to thorn in their future  life,  utilising for this purpose accomodation now in the possession of the Ministry of Munitions,  (see attached Memo.  Paragraph 2),  Authority will bo needed to pay a maintenance grant to the  persons referred to in Paragraph 4and to pay those referred to in Paragraph 7.         Thoso proposals are net put forward as  a  complete oroven adequate solution of the problem of the unemployed woman workers,but it is thought that if carried  through with sufficient promptitudeand on a sufficiently large scalo  they will alleviato distress withouthampering the restart of normal industry,  and that they will  diminish the suspicion and unrost among the workers which now form the most dangerous  feature of tho situation.                                  STE1PHBU80JJ ONT,                              Controller General of Civil                              Demobilisation and Resettlement,                                      BJ54 IS * 18.
MEMORANDUM Oil ESE PROVISION 01 ^AlfflG. AjjP MAIIlffSMCE        In view 01 the  diifioulty oi finding employment for thelarge numbers of discharged women war workers, the Women1 s Branchof the  Demobilisation  and Resettlement -Department propose thata scheme of  training in household management, domestic science and infant welfare  should be offered to those women who havemarried soldiers s,nd who are awaiting their return to establish ahome, or who are enges&amp;&amp; ^0 marry soldiers on the demobilisation of the  Army.  It appears from information received from WelfareSupervisors  in National and Controlled Munition factories, andfrom others, that thero are a largo number of such war wives andof fiancees  who are not Intending to continue in industry on themen&apos;s return, and theso it would be well to encourage to abstain from compensation*t;ing in the  labour market for the next few months,These young  women have spent the past two or three years in Fao-tpries  and many of  them have resided in hostels, and thus theyhave not been able  to  avail themselves of even the usual oppor-tunities of  acquiring  practical knowledge of home craft and cook-ing.  To such it is believed that an opportunity for obtaining a general training  in  all suoh matters would be welcome and that&apos;a National purpose  would be served by courses in home management,health  and child welfare being provided for them in preparation for marriod  life.             It is.therefore recommended:-,             1*  That  a scheme of general training in householdmanagement,  domestic science and infant-welfare should be pro-vided for women of  marriageable ago, especially for the young warwives and women engaged to be married.   The scheme should applyprimarily to registered unemployed women who-(a) married since August  1914  and have not set up a home of their own with their husbands, (b) are willing to sign a statement that they are en-gaged to be  married and desire to marry as soon as circumstances permit.             8.  That  for sunh purpose use should be made of the government Vermont Hostels  and of some of the National Factories, forresidential  and non-residential schemes as may be most suited tothe locality.  Coventry and Srith are examples of Hostels suitablefor residential schemes, and Hayes, Aintrse (Liverpool) andBotherham being examples of National factories suitable for adapta-tion for non-rgsidential schemes.  An example of each scheme&apos;should be put iirbo  execution in two of these centres at once, tobe extended  to others  as soon as (l) a demand for such extensionhas been shewn to exist, (Z) the success of the original ventureseemed  to warrant it.  The Local Advisory Committee should be con-suited  in each Aroa.             3.  That  the training should rank as employment andnot enoroach upon any part of the 13 weeks of unemployment bone-fit.             4.   That  a subsistence allowance of 25/- a week shouldbe made to each woman who entered the training course for a.period of not less than 3 months.  Evory endeavour should be made/to
to secure that a woman completes her course of training when she has joined and she should give an undertaking to pursue it to the end, but she should not be refused out-of-work donation if she should leave the course. 

During training the names should not be kept on the live register of the Employment Exchange, but on a special list so that employment should not be offered a trainee unless she registers at the Exchange.

5. That a woman in residence under a scheme should be charged a flat rate of 18/6 per week for lodgings and  full board.

6. That the training should be of a practical nature suitable to the actual requirements of the trainees and  should include housowork, kitchen work, sewing (mending and making dresses upholstory, and simple house-furnishing etc.), washing, ironing, infant welfare and child management, personal hygiene, home nursing and  physical culture. These subjects to be sypplemented by simple lessons in expenditure, shopping etc. Matters of general interest and simple recreation should form part of the currioulum.

7. That teachers be engaged who, while holding certificates in domestic subjects, home nursing etc. are not at present engaged In teaching under the Board of Education or any local education authority. - Such persons are  already found in considerable numbers among the Welfare Supervisors, Canteen Superintendents and Assistants,  Hostel Matrons, etc. discharged or about to be discharged from munition Factories and Munition Areas. - These certificated teachers should be supplemented by the assistance of practical women competent to demonstrate under trained teachers.

The chief features of the above scheme have been favourably considered by the women&apos;s Trade Union Advisory Committee. Many of the Lady Superintendents of the National Factories have expressed their opinion that training courses of this description would be of roal benefit to the many discharged women who are anxious as to how they shall tide ever the next few months of unemployment, and to those who are looking forward to  settling down in the future to married life few which, however, they are conscious of being ill-equipped. The Waman&apos;s Branch believe that the scheme proposed would be appreciated as showing a real desire on the part of the Department to cope with an unprecedented situation and to benefit not only a deserving section of the munition workers but the returning soldiers and the Nation at large.
