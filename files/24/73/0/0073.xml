POST jqB, FUNCTIONS 0?Admiralty Memorandum f     The attitude of the Admiralty in connection with the future of tho air has been stated in the memorandum addressed to the iVar Cabinet on the 7th January - (G.T.6613)-.      Briefly it recognises that a form of transport in an entirely new oedium has been developed and that the possible effects on the Nations and civilisations of the earth arising therefrom may be far reaching.  Sea communication has rendered possible the development of the British Empire, irtille civilisation and the expansion of the British Empire have generally followed the lines of.sea oommunloatlon.   Air communication with its free access to regions inaccessible from the sea would have similar influences and the power predominant in air communication will hold the future    Under these circumstances the Admiralty viewed the proposals contained in the paper addressed by the Air Ministry to the War Cabinet on the 12th Deoember with sympathy although it contained some factors not easily reconciled to their views and requirements.      The system of a separate Air Ministry is. In many respects, incon- venient to the sea-going Navy, while its administration has be^n found [irksome to the ex-Royal Haval Air Service personnel.   Nevertheless the I Admiralty generally supported the proposed system, with certain reserva- tions because It appeared to promise the greatest possibilities of a rapid [occupation of the Air by British fimpire personnel and aircraft.      But if an amalgamation of the Air Ministry with any other public f departmentment is to be oarried out, there could not? from the Admiralty point of view^ be a less suitable one for this purpose e than the War j Office .  AS stated in the Admiralty Memorandum, quoted above, the Ministry phioh governs the Air Service should be thoroughly permeated with a know- lied ge of navigation, machinery and conditions of weather, and should have ir experience and be in olose touch with the industrial world  *   To these requirements the tfar Office constributes absolutely nothing  . Under such an amalgamation it is diffioult to conceive that commercial Aviation ifill, receive that direction^and assistanoe so neoessary if the Empire is [to become predominant in the air ,  A far better case in the Interest of I the Empire cou^d be made out for amalgamating the Air Force with the new I Ministry pf Transportation or with the Admiralty.      Froma purely Naval point of view the vital question at issue is what ) method is to be used for providing suoh flying work as is an essential I part of Naval operations *  If there is not to be a separate Air Ministry I or if a single Minister is to oontrol both the War Office and Air Ministry. j the Servioes whioh these two Departments have in common, viz: stores. : quartermaster services oontraots^ feoruiting, entry of officers, etc., I will, in the opinion of the Admiralty, inevitably receive Military, at the i expense of Naval, consideration, and ror this reason they view the proposal with considerable concern.      The Admiralty feel that under such conditions the present relations between the Navy and the Air Forde should be modified in the direction of Placing a greater responsibility for Naval flying upon the Admiralty than is at present the oase t and if the basis on which the -admiralty Memorandum to the War Cabinet (G.T.6478) was written is to be altered, the remarks expressed therein will require modification,                                 (Sgd)  v/.H.
