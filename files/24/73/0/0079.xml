Minute 2,  said that Sir Douglas Haig was satisfied with          the scale  of gratuities for of fibers recommended by the          Committee (G. T. 6,592) *    Ho had suggested, -however, that          these gratuities should not he subject to income tax.               SIR CHARLES HARRIS said that he had consulted the          legal authorities on this matter.   The position was that          any gratuity paid according to the terms of service or          under a special contract, suoh as those under Art ids 4S7          of the Pay Warrant, was assessable for income tax.   Other          gratuities, which were not provided for in the terms of s*erv*          Ice, were not assessable.   He read the terms of a notice          whioh ho proposed should bo published in the Presst &apos;               THE CHAIRMAN said that if this notice was published          they would bo immediately met with petitions to have pen-          sions freed from income tax.               THE COMMITTEE took note of the faot that fjir Douglas                    Haig agreod with the recommendations of the                    Committee as set out in G.T.S592.               As regards the question of whether these gratuities               were subject to Income tax, the Committee decided:-                    That any notice to this effect should be published                    merely in Army Orders and Fleet Orders, and that                    suoh notices before they were published should be                    submitted to the Board of Inland Revenue for                    their approval.
                            M g W[TIES TO     3.   SIR CHARLES HARHIS, with reference to tho 43rd Mooting,IT OFFICERS, Minuto 7, said that he understood Mr.2Forster&apos;s view wasOFFICERS,   that tho gratuitios to those men should remain aB already   AND ,     decided in 0.1.6286.f TEE NAVY,iND AIR           THE COMMITTEE -agreed:-                      That this question should again ho adjourned                      until tho Financial Secretary to the War Offioo                      was able to attond. RATE3 OF  4,   SIR CHARLES HARRIS, with reference to tho 43rd Meeting,&apos; THE NAVY, Minuto 6, explained that the Secretary of State for War1KB AIR     thought that it was: at present most undesirable to settle           permanently tho quest ion of tho future rates of pay in the           Army    This was the worst possible time to go into fufEre           permanent rates of pay, and it would be no injustice to the           regular soldier to postpone it for throo months or so.           In any case, a Cabinet decision would bo necessary as to           the extent to which the pay of the regular soldier should           now be dealt with.   Tho Seoretary of State, however, thought           it was of groat importance that the rates of pay for the           Army of Occupation should be settled as soon as possible.           He had therefore institt&amp;sft Oommltteos who were to look into           this matter at onco and to make recommendations.   Provision-           al proposals should be ready In a few days.                DR.MA01JAMARA said that as far as regarded the Navy,           this was a vory vital question.   Admiral $ orram, the           President of the Committee of Enquiry at Ports, would be           commencing his work very soon, and in all probability he           would nut in  immediately proposals for an ad interim           increase in the substantive pay of the lower deck&apos;,&apos;   hat  is           to say, in view of the time his work was going to take, he           might propose a temporary increase of perhaps 25 per cent.           of what would have to be&apos;agreed to finally.&apos;&apos; The Board of           Admiralty would,thon have to come to the Committee for au-           thority to make theso increases, aid a difficult position           would arise if the War Office were not ready with similar  .           proposals.                THE CHAIRMAN said that there was on all hand a great           deal of unrest about this matter.   The prime Minister and           the Chancellor of the  Exchequer had both agreed to a form           of words which had been oublished.   (42nd Meeting, Minute           2),   The Government were committed to seeing that tho pay           of tho flavy and Army was inoreased, and tho Committee had           authority jfrom the War Cabinet to make recommendations.           Would it not be possible to give a bonus or increase of,           say, 25 per cent, to those men who wore only staying in tho           arm; temporarily, sush as those who formed tho Army of           Occupation?                MlUBALDWIfl expressed general agreement with the views           of the War Offioo.                ADMIRAL TO THILL pointed out that the Admiralty wore  &apos;           rapidly demobilising their temporary men;  *  their position           was entirely different from that of tho Jtay in that they           would soon be on a permanent basis.                TEE COMMITTEE decided                      To adjourn further discussion on this matter until                      definite proposals were received from the Board                      of Admiralty and the Army Council.
?TUITIES TO ?TAL SURGEONS.

5. SIR CHARLES HARRIS, with reference to Paper or No.122, said that in the Army both doctors and dental  surgeons served on a contract basis, under which the former obtained a gratuity of Â£60 for each year or part of a year of service, while no provision was made for gratuities to the latter. It was a question of policy whether a man in whose contract there was no provision for a gratuity should receive a gratuity only slightly less than a man in whose contract such provision was made.

MR. BARST0W said that dental surgeons served on a definite contract an which no mention was made of a  gratuity. There appeared to be no reason why gratuities should be granted to them.

MR. WALKER said that no officers in the Navy served on a contract basis. As things stood at present, the      Admiralty were asked to make a difference between dental surgeons and other officers of the Navy, and to announce that every temporary officer except dental surgeons would have a gratuity.

DR. MACNAMARA said that the Admiralty wished to troat their dental surgeons in the same way as other    officers in the Navy, but that they were opposed by the Treasury and tho War Office.

THE COMMITTEE decided:-

That this matter should be out on the Agenda for the next Meeting.

?MUM RATE OF ? IN THE ARMY.

6. SIR CHARLES HARRIS, with reference to the 43rd Meeting, Minute 5, said that he had looked into the metter  raised in the correspondence between Mr. Appleton and Lord Milner and between Mr.Appleton and Colonel Wilson. He was of opinion that Colonel Wilson&apos;s reply to Mr. Appleton was both correct and adequate. The men received a minimum of l/6d per day, and as Mr. Appleton had not taken any further action, it was to be assumed that he was satisfied with colonel Wilson&apos;s explanation.

THE COMMITTEE took note:-

Of Sir Charles Harris&apos; statement.

?TUITIES TO ?ICERS OF ? AIR FORCES.

7. MR. BLAND, with reference to Paper No.123, said that most of the officers of the Air Force would soon be   demobilised, but that a number of those would afterwards come back to take permanent commissions. On demobilisation they would draw a gratuity under Article 497 of the Pay Warrant, and it appoared distinctly unfair that those few officers who would remain In the Air Force without a broak should draw only the much lower gratuity of the Regular Officer.

SIR CHARLES HARRIS suggested that it should be announced to all Air Force Officers who were being demobilised that those who wished to obtain permanent commissions should register their names before demobilisation. Such officers should then receive on demobilisation tho gratuity as fixed for permanent officers, and if, after a oertain period, they were not granted permanent commissions, they should be paid the balance of the gratuity due to them under Article 497 of the Royal Warrant.
I&apos;     THE OQMMXTT^ decided:-          To recommend to tho Air Council for their          consideration:     (a)  Th*&apos;-t an announcement should bo made to all          officers who wore being demobilised that per-          manent commissions would bo granted onHy &quot;to          those officers who registered their names before.          demobilisation.     (b)  Thi.it all officers who registered their names for          permanent commissions should receive on demob-          il-sat ion the gratuity to whioh they would be          entitled as permanent officers.     (c)  That if, within a certain period,  such offiocrs          had.not been granted permanent commissions, tha y          should receive tho balance  of the  gratuity due          to thorn under Articl3 497 of tho Royal Warrant,     If tho Air Council thought it to bo necessary, thisnatter should again be brought up before the Committee.
