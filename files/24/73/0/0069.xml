There  has been a.gooddeal of snow, but as a rule it melted quickly.   Except on thelightest lands all work has been at a standstill;    and in thevalleys there was much flooding.   Generally the winter wheat  dropcontinues to look well, but in several parts of the  country thereare indications that unless an early change in  the weather occursthe crop will suffer.                   LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. &quot;             Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.Prosecutions.   A farmer at South Cerney  in Gloucestershire hasbeen-fined  10 and  5. 5s. costs for failure to comply with acultivation notice served upon him by the  Committee.Determination of Tenancies.   During the  week 15 Orders have beenmade by the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming,the total acreage being 362 acres.                        Land Drainage.                   County Council Committees.-          Regulations have been, made entitled &quot;The Land Drainage(Constitution of Authority) Regulations,  1919,&quot; which enable the
Board to constitute committees for counties, or for areasincluding counties and county&apos;boroughs, to exercise the powersof the Board under.Part &apos;II of the Land Drainage Act, 1918cThe principal of these are the exercising of the powers of an existing drainage authority where these are insufficientlyexercised, and the carrying out of schemes for the improvement!small areas which are limited to a cost of  5,000 for construct!of works.   These regulations have been circulated to CountyCouncils with the suggestion that they should apply to the Boarsfor an Order constituting a drainage oommittee for the county,the same time, draft orders for this purpose have been sent out for their observations to the County Councils of those countieswhich there has been considerable activity with regard to drain;matters.          Ordinarily the Drainage Committee will consist of 8members appointed by the County Council (of whom 7 must beCounty Councillors) and 4 appointed by the Board.   In general!the nominees of the Board will be members of the County ExecutijCommittee who have taken an active interest in the subject.   i          County.Councils have also been asked to appoint acommittee under section 2 of  the Act to consult with the Boardupon proposed Orders constituting Drainage Boards and enlargingthe area of existing drainage authorities.   It is hoped thatthe constitution of such committees will obviate the delaycaused by the fact that the County Councils have to be consultsupon proceedings of this kind, ^nd that the  opinion  of the fullCouncil  can only be ooteined  at its quarterly meeting.   Such&apos;committee, though technically^ separate body, might well incluthe same County Council members as the Lrainage Committee above referred to.....,       .
            In Lancashire there appears to be a strong feeling that   the County Council should be the drainage authority, and should  take over the undertakings of the four existing authorities in the  county, each of which controls only a. small area.   Two of these  authorities are. of importance, in that the area under their  jurisdiction covers a -portion, but a portion only, of a drainage  system which should serve a considerable acreage of valuable land.  One of these systems (that of the River Douglas) was visited last  week by a representative of the Department, and several hundred  acres were under  deep floodj  - in one place a potato clamp was  observed close to the edge of the waters.    The other river  referred to is the Alt,.the valley of which runs in a north-westerly  direction from the confines of Liverpool,            With regard to the Great Ouse, petitions have now been  received for the  formation of a drainage authority to control the-&quot;whole of its valley, together with that of the Cam, from the  County Councils of Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire and  the Isle of Ely.    The Norfolk County Council have resolved to send  a similar petition, and the only County Council which has declined                                                                   N  to take part in this movement is that of West Suffolk.   It is  proposed when the Norfolk petition has been received, to institute  preliminary enquiries whioh will provide material for the solution  of this very complicated and  pressing problem.                         HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.                         ii   I. *.......-............................  I.,  Provision of Land Tor Allotments.   Since April 30th last 418 local  authorities, have  agreed to acquire under the Cultivation of Lands  Orders 4,808 acres (60,681 allotments).            During  the week, in addition to the land mentioned above,  27 local authorities have agreed to acquire for allotments a total  of 221 acres,  equivalent to 2,283 allotments, inoluding 87 acres  at Lincoln.
           At Topsham (Devon), 8Of of the householders are cultivafl gardens attached to their houses, and 54  are cultivating allotmej of 12 poles each.. Fruit Section.  - Inspections and demonstrations in fruit orchards have been carried out during the week in Cornwall, Huntingdonshire and Norfolk.           /s showing the need for instruction and assistance in connection with orchards, it is reported that a great deal of ham has been done in an orchard in the Birmingham district through brushing the trees with paraffin oil &quot;in order to clean them and( kill the blight&quot;,   Many of the trees were killed outright. Marketing Section,  The Department are having an enquiry made into the work of the Dorset County Society, with a view to opening up&apos; new collecting districts,           The Devon Society has reported that there is a considers&apos; quantity of surplus potatoes, and the matter has been taken up with the Ministry of Pood.   The Society has been placed in touch with the Pvmy Service Corps who have bought supplies for their immediate requirements.           The Ministry of Pood proposed to amend the British Onion Order, but the Market Garden Section of the Horticultural Advisory Committee protested that any amendajeat reducing the price would inflict hardship on those growers who had held onions, and the Ministry accordingly decided not to amend the Order for the presen                           TECHNICAL DIVISION Corn Growing in Late and Wet Districts,   A&apos; memorandum on this subject has been prepared, summarising the information received from correspondents in reply to an enquiry recently addressed to them by the Technical Committee.   The replies received show generally the desirability of (1) sowing an early-ripening variety suited to local conditions of soil and climate;  (2)
 obtaining seed from an early district;   (3)  applying phosphates. preferably superphosphate,&apos; at seed tine.    By the  adoption  of these principles the harvest In late  districts should be  advanced by as much as 10 days or a fortnight.   The  advice has been sent to the press, for the Information of graziers  and others who may recently have begun growing corn under  the  conditions referred  to, and a copy of the memorandum will be  circulated to Agricultural Organisers etc., for the purpose of advising farmers in their districts. Frit Fly Experiments.  Arrangements have  been made for continuing and extending the investigations made in  1918, the main obleots in view being (1) to discover the exact stage which the oat plant must reach before the flies appear, if  it is to avoid being injured;  (2) to learn if any special varieties of oata reach this stage more rapidly than others;  (3)  to investigate tillering power in relation to frit attack.   Two series  of  trials have been decided upon:-  (a) variety trials, with a  large number of  varieties, sown on small plots, and on the same  date;   (b) a  series  of large plot                                          i trials, with one variety, and four or five  sowings at different dates at each centre. Oats&quot;and Barley ;for Seed, Purposes. The Seed Testing Station have recently received a number of samples of oats and  barley  which  have been heated in the staok.   In some cases the germination of these samples has been only about 20$, and  in the  majority of oases not more than ,60 or 70$.&apos;   Farmers have been urged to  have such grain tested before using it for seed purposes.                          LABOUR DIVISION.  &apos;           The &quot;controlled&quot; labour on  agricultural  work in England.and Hales is now as follows;-Soldiers ........fcoweVs Land ArmyPrisoners of WarTotal 71,977 11,349 29.569112,895Four weeks ago the total number was 115,157.
          Among the soldiers above mentioned are  included  12,811men who have been attached to Agricultural Companies pendingdemobilisation, under arrangements made with the  Army authoritiesDemobilisation.  Regulations issued by the War Office state thatagriculture is now one of the industries &quot;open&quot; for demobili3atlobut no information is available as to the precise effect of this regulation.   The Department of Demobilisation and Resettlementhave been asked whether they are able to give some assurance thatthe bulk of agriculturists who have employment awaiting them willbe demobilised before the end of February in order to be availablfor the work of spring cultivation.   In view of  the backwardnessof farm work all over the country, this is absolutely essential if food production is to be maintained.-   The question of  the demobilisation of the Agricultural Companies is also bound up witthat of the release of agriculturists generally.   Many thousands of the soldiers In these companies will not be remaining on fanwork, and if they are demobilised before the return of agricultuifrom overseas serious dislocation and loss of crops for the autuharvest will result.          As regards the &quot;pivotal&quot; men, the names of 15,638agriculturists &apos;have been forwarded to date to the Department ofDemobilisation and Resettlement, but although the first lists wesent in early  in December apparently very few of  the men have yebeen released.                         Women&apos;s Branch.          A number of Land Army women are still unemployed,partly owing to winter weather.   Arrangements are being made tcrelease those who are least suitable for land work, and to employ the remainder in work kindred to agriculture until  theyare wanted in the spring.   Advertisements are being inserted in Farm and Garden papers to the effect that a certain number
of women are available for farming and unskilled garden work.It Is hoped by this means to absorb all labour of sufficientskill to be of use in the spring.          13,032 women are accounted for in the Land Army asfollows:-          On farm Work ..............................  11,349          Lent to Timber Cutting Section..........,.     393          In Training Centres  .*.....................     325          Waiting for references to be placed in                         Training Centres...........      15          Waiting for employment in Depots  .........     262          Waiting for employment in their own homes  .     688                                          Total .....   13,032          The last two items include those women who are onsick leave or convalescent.          Some 9,000 replies have been received tc the enquiry as.tc which members of the land Army desire ,to remain in farm work,and over 5,000 are in the affirmative.  It is satisfactory toknow that this number includes those who have been amongst thebest workers.          In this connection a meeting was held during the week of men and women who have had experience in land settlementquestions, to discuss preliminary schemes to give facilities tosuch women as desire to remain permanently in land work.Women&apos;s Institutes.  Twelve new Institutes were started last weekmaking a total of 789.          h very successful Institute has recently been formed into-uro.  The town is the centre of agricultural activity inCornwall and in connection with the Institute a club has ^eehopened for country worsen on.market days of which there arealready 250 members.          The Girl Guide movement is In many cases co-operating with Women1s Institutes * and a Junior group of members of oneof the &quot;Welsh Institutes have ail become Girl Guides.                             m Y m
                    CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor Scheme-  The following statement shows ,the position     fjwith regard to the provision of tractors, implements, etc.,owned by the Itepartment for the week ended 11th January, 1919j-                                        No. consigned  Total No.                                        during week.   with County               Tractors                       -          4,191               Ploughs                        5          5,322                                       (6 withdrawn)               Cultivators, 9/11 tine         -          1,472          During the week ended 27th December, 746 acres were ploughed and 75 acres cultivated;  the small quantity of work dontwas of course due to the Christmas holidays.          Agricultural Executive Cemmittees are being asked to tatall possible steps to ensure that tractors and implements shall btin good condition for the spring ploughing.          Tests of engine oils from various firms are about to  Ibe carried out in the North Riding of Yorkshire.liorse Scheme.  The implements supplied to counties during thepast month are as follows:-                                        No. consigned  Total No.                                        during month,  with Count]               Drills                         3         1,515               Potato Diggers                 2           270          During the week 458 Brood Mares, and a few geldingshave been sold, the average price being well maintained.          In Gloucestershire one mare fetched 175 guineas, and 9ethers averaged 115 guineas,  in Flint and Denbigh the averagewag 76 guineas, in Cambridge 60 guineas, and 16 geldings soldat Kettering averaged 75 guineas.  In Hampshire, where the horses]were nearly all purchased originally from the Army, and cost anaverage price of  45, the average realised was  30.          At least 90% of these animals were bought by farmers.
Steam Tackle.  The acreage dealt with during the past week is as follows:-  ploughed 3,654 acres, cultivated 1,197 acres,harrowed 144 acres, mole.drained 41 acres.*  Total 5,036 acres.Threshing Machinery,  Two additional threshing machines havebeen supplied to counties.                        SUPPLIES DIVISION.Nitrate of Soda.  The offer of nitrate of soda from government stocks has not resulted in any substantial demand from dealers.The trade generally is unwilling to buy in view of the possibilityof a fall in price defore the spring demand ha3 been satisfied,and farmers are indisposed to order in advance, as their requirements are largely dependent on the character of the season.There has been some complaint from holders of stocks of nitrateof soda bought at commercial prices, that the Government&apos;s offerwill cause them appreciable loss.  It is not proposed to keep theoffer open, and sales will be limited to those firm3 which havealready placed orders with the Department.Agricultural and Garden Seeds.  A census of stocks and prospectivesupplies of seed3 in England and Wales indicates that, with a fewrelatively unimportant exceptions, ample supplies of bothagricultural and garden seeds will be available for the comingseason.  Licences for the export of seed are now being granted for quantities estimated to be well within the margin of the exportable surplus.Seed Potatoes.  It is important that a definite announcement should now be made about the intentions of the Government in thematter of the control of prices of the 1919 potato crop.  Thereis no doubt that growers are unlikely to make definite purchases of &quot;seed&quot; until they know, either that control will be removed,or what form of control will be retained.
Cereal Seeds.  Preliminary arrangements have been made with theRoyal Commission on Wheat Supplies for the purchase and inspection of seed oats required for shipment to France.  every endeavour is being made to secure the quantity required.Wart Disease,  The evidence which has been accumulated by theBoard during the season, indicates very clearly the necessity fcareful inspection of the growing crops of immune varieties, inorder to secure &quot;seed&quot; true to name.  A very large number ofinstances of the distribution of consignments, sold as immune,which contained a large number of susceptible &quot;rogues&quot;, have be notified during the past few months.  It is hoped that in 1919,growers of immune varieties who propose to sell a portion of Mscrop for &quot;seed&quot;, will apply for the inspection of their crop bythe Board of Agrioulture of the country in which they  are grown,Impure &quot;seed&quot; i3 constantly demonstrated to be a fruitful cauaeof the spread of the disease.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.     President of the Board of Agriculture                      and Fisheries.
