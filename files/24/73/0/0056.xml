(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.- The strikes of the riveters and caulkers at Messrs.Armstrong &amp;  Whitworth&apos;s, Walker-on-^Ty116&apos; and the boilermakers  in  the Tyne, Wearand Tees  districts, have assumed large proportions.    (6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work. The woolcombers have decided to give notice to strike on the ] st February if they are not granted the 45-hour week.                  PART  I-THE  LAUSANNE  CONFERENCE.    In view of the proximity of the Peace Conference, and with it of the parallel Labour-Conference at Lausanne, it may be  useful  to  summarise such material as is availablethrowing any  light on the  lines along which the latter conference  may be expected todevelop.   In any case it will be an important factor in the situation, and may in certaincircumstances  have a considerable influence on the conduct of affairs at the Peace Table,.at any rate as regards labour.    There would appear to be two broad possibilities which constitute the two alternativepolicies that the  Lausanne Conference may pursue in their most fundamental aspects.On the  one hand, the Conference may  conceivably include  in its terms  of referenceeverything, in the main, that the Official  Conference deals with.  In this event there are obvious possibilities of a clash between the views  adopted at Lausanne and those putforward on behalf of  the Government in Paris.  It is not difficult to see  the  possible consequences of such an open clash.  From the enemy&apos;s point of view socialist and labourdelegates will presumably be sent to the two conferences, but at the moment the difficulty&apos;of getting representative enemy delegations seems to be as great in the case  of Lausanneas in that of Paris.  It appears far more likely that there will be several bitterly ,hostile&apos;.delegations from Germany and the Austrian territories.  It  is not improbable that the lausanne  Conference will resolve itself into  a fierce struggle between the moderate andextreme sections,  as was the case at the Inter-Allied Conference in  London, and that itwill be unable to formulate any  united view on political questions.    In considering the question of relations between  the  Lausanne Conference  and&apos;thePeace Conference, the  attitude  of  such  of  the Labour Press of this country  towards   (C1016)  120  1/19 H&amp;SH
President Wilson is worth noting.  There  is a strong tendency  in certain quarters to regard President Wilson as the real link between the Lausanne Conference and the PeaceConference.  The general  feeling  that he is the only  statesman prepared to advocatewith sincerity the international ideals of Labour&apos;, found expression in the  desire of theFrench and British organisations to give him a special welcome during his visit to Europe,and proposals  have been  put forward for an  early meeting of  a fully representative&quot; Internationale,&quot; which should  pass  resolutions proving to the world that organised labour  stands everywhere  in  favour of the President^ policy and is prepared to backhim with all its force against  possible reactionary elements at the Peace Conference.  Inother quarters strong opposition is, of course,  shown to Labour&apos;s having  to rely on a&quot; bourgeois politician.&quot;  But  all this goes to show that as regards Labour affairs, at anyrate, President Wilson&apos;s actions will be of peculiar importance.     On the whole, however, it is  more likely that the Lausanne Conference will confineitself to questions of international Labour legislation, leaving political considerationsgenerally out of account, and will throw its whole energy into developing the somewhatisolated activities of late years into something really comprehensive and important, havingthe official sanction of all  the nations  concerned behind it.   It becomes then of interestto recall such declarations as have been made which have a bearing on the points ofLabour legislation likely to be discussed,  and the views  that are likely  to be takenregarding them.     So   far  as  regards   Great  Britain,  Mr.  Henderson   has  outlined  the  generalpolicy of the conference in a recent  interview in  the statement that &quot; the chief task of the  delegates  will be  to  formulate a  charter  of  international Labour legislation which the Peace Congress will be invited to incorporate in the Treaty of Peace.&quot;  this involves in Mr. Henderson&apos;s view the securing of approximately equal conditions of labour in all the countries concerned, and is correlative to the formation of a League of Nations,the effectiveness of the one implying  that  of the other.  This maintains the somewhatgeneral and vague attitude towards the question noticeable in that part of the Inter-AlliedMemorandum which deals with the setting-up  of international guarantees  in regard towages,  hours of labour, &amp;c.  The detailed  proposals of the British organisations are sofar  only  to be found  in  the election speeches of  prominent members of the  LabourParty.  Among these may be noted  Mr. J. H,  Thomases statement that  the  peace treaty  should include a guarantee of  a universal eight-hours&apos; day and minimum wage.     In  other countries, however, more definite pr6grammes have been put forward, withreference to their inclusion in the Treaty of Peace.     As  regards France, the  reply of the  Confederation Generale to  M. Clemenceau&apos;suggestion,  at  the deputation which he received on 31st December, that they shouldformulate a detailed scheme of proposals which might be  brought before the Peace Con-ference  is now available.   M. Clemenceau is reported to  have  informed the  deputationthat the principle of the eight-hours&apos; day was  already approved,  and  to have agreed tothe summoning of the  Lausanne  Conference.   The  reply presented by M. Jouhaux as reported contains the following heads:      (1)  Official recognition of Trade Union (&quot; Syndical &quot;) organisation.     (2)  Intervention in all Labour relations.     (3)  Participation in management and control.    (4)  Transformation of  political into economic administration.     (5)  Expropriation of bureaucracy, and  substitution for it of a rational organisation           permitting the maximum of technical qualification in each economic domain.    This statement, at any rate as reported, is somewhat obscure, especially clause (5),while (4) though clear enough is extremely vague.  The first three clauses are those alonewhich can be placed beside the American proposals referred to below, as detailed suggestionsregarding international  Labour  legislation, and  these  together may  be  regarded asoutlining a very progressive attitude towards the status of trade unions.    It may also be worth recalling, as regards France, that concrete proposals for inter-national Labour legislation  have  been published  by  the  Labour  Commission.  these include  the reforms adopted by resolution at the Berne Conference of the  InternationalAssociation for Labour Legislation held in 1913, and may, therefore, be worth quoting:      (1)  The  prohibition of night work for  juveniles;  a ten-hours&apos;  day for women and           juveniles.     (2)  The  establishment of an International Conference of  Labour to be composed           of delegates  from each country, representing employers and employed.
    (3) This Conference  to consider the following reforms:     (a) No employment of children under ] 4.    (b) Limitation of the hours of work, and an eight-hours&apos;  day for miners and other          special branches of industry.    (c) Establishment of a weekly holiday of If days.    (d) Organisation of unemployment and other insurance.    (e). Equality in wages and conditions between native and foreign workers.    The Labour  Committee  of  the  French  Chamber has since adopted  the  report  ofM. Justin Godart which embodies these proposals.    The American Federation of Labour has maintained since the beginning of the war that Labour should have distinct representation at  the Peace Conference, and that anInternational Labour Conference should be convened at  the  same time as the general conference.  Among the principles which,  according to the Federation,  must underlythe Peace Treaty, it incorporated the following four clauses bearing on  internationalLabour legislation:     (1) No article or commodity shall be shipped or  delivered  in international commerce          in the  production  of which children under the  age of 16 have been employed          or permitted  to work.    (2) It shall be declared that the basic  workday  in industry and commerce shall not          exceed eight hours.    (3) Involuntary  servitude shall not exist except as  a  punishment for crime whereof          the party  shall have been duly convicted.    (4) Establishment of trial by jury.    These clauses, with  the  addition of three further ones, were adopted  at the Inter-Allied  Labour and Socialist Conference held  in London in September,  1918.  The threeclauses added provide that:     (5) In law and practice the  principle shall be recognised that the labour of a human         &apos; being is not  a commodity or article of commerce.    (6) The right of  free association, free  assemblage, free  speech, and free Press shall          not be abridged.    (7) The seamen of the merchant marine shall be  guaranteed the right of leaving their          vessels when the same are in harbour.    These seven  clauses supplemented  the  Inter-Allied  Memorandum,  which containsonly a very  general reference  to international Labour legislation, and were combined, with it in the resolution adopted at the conference mentioned above.    Statements of  opinion in  America  since the signing of  the  armistice point to  a determination on  the  part of  Labour that these demands shall not be lost sight of in thepeace  discussions.   The American delegates,  although they may  admit the necessity of discussing matters  other than purely trade union  ones,  will certainly  concentrate onthese  points, and on  the best means to prevent any lowering of the present standards of wages and of living by the formation of an effective international organisation.  At a recent conference  held at Laredo,Mr. Gompers especially emphasised the last point.  now that the war is over he is apparently prepared to meet delegates from enemy countries,but he retains his objection to any &quot; Socialist &quot; as distinct from  Labour or trade unionpersonalities and  proposals.   &quot; We believe in the restoration ol the international labour movement after peace has been completely restored  to the people, even in the countrieswe have conquered, so that they will have the opportunity of living under the peacefulgovernments we shall have helped to establish &quot; (Mr. Gompers, 15th November, 1918).    The Italian Confederation of Labour demands the self-determination of peoples, theimmediate withdrawal  of troops sent  against the Russian Republic, and  &quot; world&quot;insurance against unemployment, accident, sickness and old age.    Further proposals in the same sense have been put forward by other bodies.  TheCouncil General of the Seine,  representing the French Socialists, has adopted a resolution to support the insertion in the  Peace Treaty of clauses proclaiming the determination of the Powers to establish  by international  legislation  humane  conditions  of  labourcalculated to safeguard the education and health of  children, the holding of a periodicalLabour conference and the establishment  of an international Labour Bureau.   It alsodemands that delegates of the chief Labour organisations of the Allies should be admitted to the  Official Conference to discuss the regulations of Labour for embodiment in theTreaty.(C 1615)
     Similarly in Belgium, M. Wanters, a Socialist leader and member of the new BelgianCabinet, has warned the middle classes to pay attention to the demands of Labour, and stated that the Prime Minister was in favour of international legislation for the workers.     The kind of points, then, so far as international Labour legislation is concerned, whichwill form the subject of discussion at the Lausanne Conference, are fairly clear.     Special  attention may be drawn  to the clause in the  American programme  tothe effect that the &quot; right of free  association  ....  should not be  abridged.&quot;This is  intended  to guarantee  the  right  of combination in so far as it  exists, but does not guarantee the right to  increase  it in so far as it does not.  This demand,however, there is  little doubt,  will  be put  forward, and the  question of  the status of trade unions is, of all the points which might be covered by a conference dealing purelywith international  Labour  regulation,  the  one which holds  the greatest possibility  of raising  difficulties outside, because it contains more directly political implications thandoes any other within this area.  For this reason any action taken with regard to it will need to be watched with special care.   It may also be noted that the  one clear practicalproposal which emerges in  the French  programme relates to  this question of the status of trade unions, and on this topic expresses views which  are capable of an extreme inter-pretation.     If the Lausanne Conference confines its deliberations to the question of international regulation, it may be expected to cover the ground in a comparatively short time before,in fact, the Peace Conference will have touched  the matter in any detail.  In these cir-cumstances its conclusions  and the general  attitude and proposals to which  Labour ispledged will be available for the guidance of the plenipotentiaries.  If, however, the other policy is adopted by the Lausanne Conference, in addition to the problems already referredto raised by such an eventuality, may be  noted the fact that the conference may be expectedto last a length of time at any rate comparable with that required for the Peace Conference,during all of which time, deliberations at Lausanne not having been closed, there will beopportunity for such elements as desire it to use their influence to play  the one conferenceoff against the other.                          PART  II.-PRESS  COMMENTS.                       (1) THE LABOUR AND SOCIALIST PRESS.                                    (A) Military.The Peace Conference.     Now that the General Election is over, the  attention of the Labour papers is mainlyoccupied by the coming Peace Conference, and especially with, the part President Wilsonis to play in it.  Indignation is expressed  in several of the papers at the secrecy withwhich the peace discussions are  evidently  to be carried on:  the &quot;Herald&quot; is of theopinion that all the pretence  about open diplomacy is entirely  abandoned.  M.  Cle-menceau&apos;s &quot; frank adherence to the  old system of the balance of  power &quot; is alleged to strike at the root of the League of Nations ideal, and helps to create a pessimistic attitudeof mind in the papers on the question of the terms to be demanded from Germany.President Wilson.     The &quot;Herald,&quot;  the &quot; Call,&quot;  and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&apos;&apos; are of the opinionthat since he arrived in Europe, President Wilson has made no definite statements in his speeches with regard to his peace policy.   This  &quot; silence through many speeches &quot; is thesubject of a long article by Mr. Brailsford in the &quot; Herald.&quot;  He remarks that on theoccasion of his farewell  speech to a  hostile American Senate, the President  missed hischance of answering  his critics, and since he has been in Europe he has moved with smilesand compliments among the men who  are preparing a helofs future for the German nation,and neither by appeal nor by argument has he  said a word to abate their demands ofgreed.     The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; however, in spite of certain misgivings regarding his future policy,  contains  three  separate articles  urging Labour men and women to supportPresident Wilson.                                 (B) Foreign Affairs.Russia.     The various reasons given for our intervention in Russia whether  official or semi-official are again severely criticised in  several of  the  papers.   &quot; Forward &quot; criticises
the argument that our  intervention is necessary  because  the new Russian Governmenthas repudiated all financial obligations:  it says that soldiers who had been conscriptedfor one special enterprise are now to be sent to act as the financiers sheriff officer, andpoints out that, in any case, these financial obligations in Russia were undertaken by anentirely unrepresentative Government and suggests that therefore Russian people shouldnot be held responsible.  The &quot; Call&quot; is sure that the Allies&apos;  purpose is to overthrowthe Bolsheviks and to re-establish the Czarist regime ; and this, while evidence accumulatesto show  that  the  Soviet Government is acquiring the  support  of larger  and still largersections  of the Russian people.   Since the election trickery has robbed  British labour of power to voice  its views on the subject, a general strike is the only method by whichit may hope to save the Soviet Republic.                                (C)  Home Affairs.The General Election.    The Coalition majority was. anticipated  by all the papers.   The majority, however,do not believe that the next Parliament will be able to maintain itself in  power for morethan  a  year.   Referring to &quot; that  farcical  tragedy, misnamed the General Election,&quot;&quot; Forward &quot; is especially disappointed at the failure of the Independent Labour Partycandidates.  &quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand,  thinks that the Labour Party has increased its  influence by the defeat of the pacifist members.                          /The Alternative of  Direct Action.    The &quot; Call&quot; thinks the inevitable result of the capture of  Parliament by capitalistand trade interests will be the use by the workers of direct industrial action.  &quot;Forward &quot;strongly  condemns such a policy, and maintains that Labour will not sutler defeat if onlyit has the  sense to&apos; use last Saturday^ rebufl for the intensification of propaganda  in preparation for another political  struggle 12  months hence.   George&apos; Lansbury, in the&quot; Herald,&quot;  on the other hand, encourages the use of direct action, a policy  which iscondemned by Mr. Clynes in a letter  to the &quot; Herald,&quot; in which he says that the &quot; Herald,&quot;after clamouring persistently for a General Election, is not satisfied when it comes because it does not turn  out as was hoped.   Mr. Lansbury,  however, defends  himself againstthe reproaches of  Mr. Clynes by arguing that the date election was  no election since thebulk of the soldiers were excluded  from voting, and the party which got into power ismade up of mere  political swindlers,Conscientious Objectors.    &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot; Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought &quot; all make strong appealsfor the release of conscientious  objectors.  In the words  of &quot; Forward  &quot; the stupidityand wastefulness  of keeping capable citizens in prison, whose only fault is an inability to keep an open mind on the question of the Sixth Commandment, ought to be obviousto  the  meanest understanding.-  Even those  accepting service  under the Home  Officescheme are employed on tasks for  which they are wholly  unfitted.Selling the  Nation&apos;s  Workshops.    The &quot;  Herald&quot; learns that, despite distinct pledges that at least 1,500 of the workers at  Waddon Factory would be retained,  the whole 2,700 men and women have  been handed their notices to quit.  When a deputation from the National Factory at Aintreewaited on the Ministry of Munitions to put forward a  demand for the continuance of thefactory as  a national one, it was informed  that  the factory  was about to be used as asalvage depot and stores, and that  practically all  the work could be done by women, the skilled men being advised to seek work elsewhere.           (2) THE DAILY PRESS ON DEMOBILISATION AND RESETTLEMENT.                         (A)  Discharge of Munition Workers.Employment Outlook.    It is estimated by the fi Sheffield Telegraph &quot; (1st January) that 40 per cent, of theworkers have now been discharged from National Factories.  The &quot; Evening  News &quot;(2nd January)  reports that discharges have begun again at Woolwich,  where severalthousands  are being  dispensed with  each week;  the skilled men, however,  are  beingrapidly absorbed into industries throughout the country.    (C 1615)                                                               A  3
    The &quot; Sheffield  Telegraph&quot;  (1st  January)  reports that  hundreds of  dischargedmunition workers have found  employment in cutlery  and silver factories,  and manyhave gone back to domestic service.  A great boom in the steel trade is expected (&quot; DailyNews,&quot; 3rd January), and work  on material  required  for shipbuilding,  rails, &amp;c, willprovide employment for male workers for a considerable time to come.Domestic Service.    There  are, as usual, conflicting reports concerning the return of ex-munition  workers to  domestic  service.   Enquiries  made  by  the  &quot; Daily Telegraph&quot;  (4th  January)  atBradford, Coventry, Derby, Leeds, Newcastle, &amp;c, show that  the vast majority refuseto  go  into service.  They prefer  to live on the unemployment donation.   On the otherhand,  the &quot; Daily News &quot; (4th January) quotes a statement of the Ministry of labour that since Christmas there has been an increase in the rate of return to work, particularlyin domestic service.  The Y.W.C.A. has prepared a scheme for training, whereby a &quot; BlueTriangle Orderly Corps &quot;  of domestic servants is to be established. They are to live ina hostel and receive a short training free, and  employers, will pay for hourly service.Unemployment Donation.    &quot;  John Bull &quot; (4th January)  reports that complaint is made that very little choice of future work is offered  at the Exchanges to discharged war  workers.  The idea seemsto be prevalent that unless applicants accept &quot; any kind of situation that may be open &quot;the right to  unemployment benefit is  forfeited.  The &quot; Newcastle  Daily Chronicle &quot;(2nd January), however, says the  power to withdraw the benefit is &quot; hedged  about withrestrictions &quot; and is to be &quot; administered leniently.&quot;                           (B) Demobilisation oj the At my.Objections to Delay,    The &quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; (4th January), in a leading article, declares that the processof demobilisation &quot; brooks no delay, for strong feelings are being aroused and are findingexpression  in all quarters.&quot;   This sentiment also finds expression in several other papers.The &quot;  Evening News &quot; (3rd January) reports that several thousand troops at Folkestonemarched in protest against delays to the Town  Hall, but were eventually persuaded toreturn to their rest camps.  &quot; Jobs are ready and waiting,&quot; declares the &quot;Daily Express&quot;(3rd January), &quot; but the Red Tape Octopus still clings tenaciously to its victims.&quot;  other papers put down the delay to   military obstructions.&quot;  The &quot; Daily  Express &quot; (3rdJanuary), in  a leading article,  says that it is the duty of the War Cabinet to removeobstruction, and to give the  civilian powers fair play.   If it is leave from France whichis&apos;the  obstruction, the men at the front  should be asked whether they prefer leave or aquicker certainty of getting out of the  army.   The  &quot; Pall  Mall Gazette &quot; (1st January)returns to  the charge  that &quot; officially demobilised men are being held back  wilfully bytheir  commanding officers.&quot;  The &quot; Yorkshire Post &quot; (1st January) approves, and claimsas its own  the suggestion that men should be granted a period of leave on full pay while they find situations for themselves.The Need for Delay.    The &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot; (1st January) admits that demobilisation must be slow,but it expresses surprise that the  &quot; Coalition, knowing the facts, appealed to the country on the twin policies of.&apos; Quicker demobilisation &apos; and &apos; No more conscription.&apos; &quot;   Lieut-Colonel Repington, in the &quot; Morning Post &quot; (3rd January) continues  to warn the publicagainst too speedy demobilisation, especially as the Allies are  not demanding demobili-sation of the  greater  part of the German  Army.   While  the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; (3rdJanuary) points out  that &quot;complaints about slowness are often based on  the mistaken-assumption that  general demobilisation has already begun.&quot;    The majority of the soldiers, however, are anxious to return to civil life, and  the slowprocess of  demobilisation is deeply resented by them  (&quot; Evening News,&quot;  1st January).The &quot; Daily Express &quot; (2nd January) devotes two columns to the publication of lettersreceived from soldiers complaining about delays.  These include complaints that even when forms are  forthcoming, filling them lip brings no result, and that, in the meantime,their work in  France is of an entirely useless character.Miners.    The &quot;South Wales News&quot; (3rd January) says that the  problem of finding places for demobilised  men in the South  Wales coal fields threatens to be serious.  The&quot; subject
is being considered by the South Wales and Monmouthshire Miners&apos; Joint Demobilisation&quot;Committee, set up by the Conciliation  Board, on which both employers and workmenare represented.   Grievances arising out. of the  difficulty  of re-absorbing these men are reported by the &quot; Morning Post &quot;  (2nd January) to have led to  a strike at Llwynypia.                        PART III.-DISTRICT REPORTS.     The situation has become somewhat more disturbed.  The question of hours especially is becoming  the  focus of much discontent.  In addition to the  agitation for a shorter working day, the interpretation of the agreement as to a 47-hour week arrived  at in the engineering trades  is proving a fruitful source  of trouble, mainly centering round the question of starting and stopping times. London and South-Eastern.     The position has become more disturbed and several isolated strikes have taken place since the New Year.  The question of hours, especially with reference to the meal times, appears to be the principal cause of discontent. West Midlands.     The situation  generally appears to  be  tranquil.  The acceptance of the 47-hour week has succeeded in allaying much of the agitation for shorter hours in Coventry.  The absence of the  unemployment, foreshadowed by the rebel element, is another factor making for tranquility in this district.     In Birmingham, however, a somewhat serious dispute has arisen at the Austin Motor Works  in connection with the distribution of the 47 hours.   The men have passed a resolution refusing to accept the new  working week as laid down  by the firm, since  they allege that the new schedule was drawn up without previous consultation with them,-and does not include one feature which they regard as essential, namely,  a  free Saturday. Yorkshire and East  Midlands.     At Halifax, Leeds and Bradford the introduction of a 47-hour week has also raised the  question of  the distribution of hours.  The Leeds men appear  to  be in favour of starting at 7.30  a.m. and ending at 5 p.m.   They have decided to take a ballot on the question, however, and a further ballot is to be taken as to whether they are in favour of giving notice to  cease overtime work,  except in cases of breakdown, after  1st March. At Halifax, the engineers have decided to start work at&apos;8 a.m., and in future it is reported that they will not work  more than one hour overtime a day on  more than four days a week.     The question of starting-time led to a short strike at the Phoenix Engineering Works, near Bradford.   At these works, with&apos; the  introduction of the 47-hour week, the &quot;starting- time was fixed at 7.30 a.m.  On the first day many of the men were late, and were conse- quently locked out until they were able  to  give a  satisfactory explanation.  The  men struck as a protest against this early hour for starting;  and it has  now  been arranged that work shall begin at 8 a.m.  In Sheffield, an arrangement with regard to the distri- bution  of hours  was arrived at at a  conference between engineering employers  and. workpeople held on 28th December.  Work is to start at 8 a.m. from Monday to Friday, and  end at 5.30 p.m.  On Saturday the hours are to be from 7.30 till 12 noon.   It is generally alleged by the  men&apos;s representatives that the conference was rushed, and  thatthe trade unions were not given sufficient time in which to discuss the questions before- hand.   The agreement is provisional,  however, and only covers one month.    Some unrest is  reported among the Nottingham miners.   At one  colliery,  as a result of a short  strike, the &quot; butty &quot; system (Le., roughly, the system of  indirect payment)is to be abolished.  Discontent has again  become evident at the  Mill  Close Lead Mines,where the men allege that their old grievances have never yet been satisfactorily  settled.    At  a special meeting of the Council of the Notts Miners&apos; Association on 1st January,it was decided to request the Miners&apos; Federation Executive to press  for  an increase of6s. per day &quot; war wage,&quot;  and that failing its being secured, a ballot of the whole coal  fieldshould be taken.                                     *North-Western.    There are several signs of unrest in this district,  especially among  the corporationworkers. At Blackburn, for instance, the Corporation Tramway employees are dissatisfiedbecause they  were not granted a holiday on Christmas Day.
     It is stated that the next movement among the Lancashire cotton operatives will be- one for a shorter working week.  The officials of the Cardroom  Amalgamation are not greatly  in favour of  an agitation, but the  Weavers&apos; Amalgamation are anxious to force on the  demand.     It is reported that the Lancashire and Cheshire miners threaten to give trouble unless their demand for a 50 per cent,  advance in wages is agreed to. Northern.     The movement for a reduction in  working hours  has not been entirely  satisfied  by the granting of a  47-hour week, and a  good deal of dissatisfaction is evident.  The men allege that the recent ballot was not a true one.     On 31st  December  a meeting  of   180 delegates  and  shop  stewards,  representing workers of the engineering and shipbuilding trades, is reported to have passed  a resolution protesting against the action of the National Executives in recommending a 47-hour week without first  consulting  the men.  The meeting  expressed itself in favour of recom- mending a  44-hour week. The question of the interpretation of the agreement has also resulted in  considerable developments which are referred to  in the next section. South  Wales.     A good deal of discontent appears in this district and several  strikes are  in progress. The Executive Council of the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation  has decided  to urge the M.F.G.B. to  secure the reduction of the miners&apos; working day from eight to six hours, the reason  put forward being to  prevent unemployment and possible  conflict  between the miners and the returning soldiers.  It  is also reported that Mr. Vernon Hartshorn is endeavouring  to rouse  the South  Wales miners to lead  an  agitation against the Allied invasion of Russia. Scotland.    It is expected that  the  introduction  of the 47-hour week will cause considerabletrouble in this area, because the masters have fixed the  starting and stopping  times,  towhich the men do not agree, and no organised effort seems to have been made to obtainthe views of  the men on this subject.                               PART  IV.-DISPUTES.(a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.    Neither the Coal Controller nor the War Office Contracts Department have any strikesto report.       tReported from Oilier Sources.            The strike of the riveters and caulkers at Armstrong Whitworth&apos;s Naval Shipyard, Walker-       on-Tyne, continues, and it has since been (7th January) that many thousands of men, mostly       boilermakers, on the Tyne, Wear and Tees, struck as a protest against the interpretation of the       47 hours&apos; agreement.            In the Hull district 6,000 to 7,000 shipwrights and boilermakers ceased work on 3rd January       in connection with the 47-hour week.  They maintain that they will suffer a loss of 12s. a week       in wages owing to the reduced houis, since thay are mainly paid on hourly and piece rates;       they therefore claim a corresponding wage advance.  The platers and turners will shortly decide       whether they will strike in sympathy.            Two further strikes have occurred in connection with the 47-hour week.  One at Messrs..       Pearson &amp; Knowles, Warrington, where 1,000 men at the steel smelting works struck on     &apos;  3rd January, on the question of an adjustment of wages, alleged to be necessary owing to the       shorter working week.  The other occurred on 2nd January when practically all the employees       in the Darlaston black bolt and nut industry ceased work because, owing to the shorter number       of working hours, the piece workers claim that they are deprived of seven hours&apos; earning       power.           A strike occurred at the&apos; Lancashire and Yorkshire Company&apos;s electric power station at       Formby (Liverpool) on 2nd January.  The strikers claim that the 47-hour agreement  conceded       to railway  shopmen should be extended to them, as they allege  that they have hitherto been       treated as  shopmen.  The company&apos;s officials deny this, maintaining that  they are traffic       workers.  About 200 men are affected,  but as they have been unable to bring out  the loco-       motive and traffic workers, there is a likelihood of work being resumed shortly.           Several strikes are reported from the London area.  On 2nd January about 2,000 men at       Messrs. Clement Talbofs Motor Works, North Kensington, decided to strike over the question
        of lunch and tea hours ;  and about 150 employees at Ogston&apos;s Motor Works, Chiswick, struck        on 3rd January because the firm threatened to stop the tea hour.  700  employees  at the        Rotax Accessories and Motor Works, Acton, came out on 6th  January.  The strike of London        hairdressers&apos; assistants, which began on 23rd December, is still in progress.  A formal con-        ference of masters and men, however, has been arranged  to take place on Wednesday, 8th        January.  During the strike the masters and men opened rival saloons, the service in both cases        being voluntary.  At the men&apos;s saloon at the union headquarters no charge was made, but        a box was placed for contributions to the strike fund.            Several strikes are also reported in South Wales. These include a strike at the Gwaun-cae-        Gurwen Colliery (Glam.) on 4th January, when  1,400 miners  ceased work owing to a dispute&apos;        relating to the size of the trams.   3,000 miners at the Glamorgan Collieries, Llwynypia, refused        to work on 1st January because the management were unable  to re-employ all the demobilised        men who were ready to start work.   However,  the men resumed work the same evening on        being assured that everything would be done to cope with a difficult situation.            The strike at A. V.  Roe&apos;s, Manchester, which began on 14th December, was reported to        have been settled on 3rd January.  An agreement was arrived at that the men should return        to work on 6th January  and that they should  be  paid the district rate plus the additional        amount that has hitherto been paid over and above the district rate, on condition that this        sum is treated as an individual merit bonus.  In addition, demobilisation is to be carried out        immediately.    Not Involving Stoppage of  Work.     The  Coal Controller reports that on 1st  and  2nd January the Leicestershire minershanded in notices to terminate contracts in 14 days&apos; time in order to enforce their demandfor a change from  fork to shovel filling without any reduction in cutting price.     The  War Office Contracts  Department reports that it has been definitely.decided bythe woolcombers that, in the event of a 45-hour week being refused, notice shall be givento cease  work from 1st February.-Reported from Other Sources.            The miners in the Dulsis Valley, West Glamorganshire, numbering about 2,000, handed        in notices on 4th January to terminate contracts on the 14th instant as a protest against their        being paid on Saturdays instead of Fridays.            A strike among the Glasgow police is seriously threatened at an early date, because they        have not yet been put on the same scale of pay as the London Force.            The Bootle Municipal Employees threaten to strike on 8th January unless their grievances        are attended to.
