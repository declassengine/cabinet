The profits made on the Belgian schemes are for the account of the BelgianGovernment, and a considerable portion of the profits madeon the various neutral schemes are for the account of theFrench and Italian Governments.   The loss on the Roumanianscheme is for the account of the Romanian Government.  Thiswill reduce the total credit balance by about one-third,leaving something liko 18 millions to the credit of theBritish Government.        Taking the whole of the schemes together, the totalpremium received is close on 200 millions, and the profitbetween 13 and 14$.        The Government may be criticised for having made somuch -profit, especially on the two large items, Hulls ofBritish Steamers, 15,8 millions, Scheme No, i, and MrcraftInsurance, 10.6 millions., Scheme No, 23.         The short answer as regards Hull Insurance is that inthe Autumn of 1917 there was a very considerable deficit onthis scheme, and we had to proceed cautiously; also that theAdmiralty measures against the submarine were more successful,especially in the later months., than was anticipated.          In the case of :tho Aircraft Insurance, we did not know up to the very end what the losses would be, and It was quite possible that a successful raid might have wiped outthe whole of the credit balance,   V/e reduced the rates byone-half in February, 1917, and the key rate that was there-after charged,  viz:,  l/-v-- on ordinary dwelling houses and theircontents, cannot be considered extravagant,          Short explanatory notes on the various schemes are  -appended.
Scheme 1.

HULLS OF BRITISH STEAMERS.

In accordance with the Scheme formulated by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Insurance of British Shipping in Time of War (Cd.7560), arrangements were made at the outbreak of war for the insurance of British steamers against war risks through the Mutual War Risks Associations. The scheme provided  for the insurance of the vessels entered in the Associations at rates of premium fixed by the Government, 80% of the risk being reinsured by the Government. Eighty per cent. of the risk on vessels on voyages current at the outbreak of war was reinsured by the Government without premium.

The rates of premium have been as follows:-

                    Voyage.    91 days or Round Voyage.

Outbreak of War    1\\1//2%          2\\1//2%

1st September 1914    1%                2%

17th December 1914   3//4%           1\\1//2%

20th September 1916   1%                2%

23rd April 1917    2\\1//2%             5%

On 20th August 1917 a new scheme of differential rates according to the nature of the voyage came into operation. Under this scheme the Government took all the risk.

Total premium up to 30th November 1918  £78,330,000

Estimated Losses                        £62,500,000

                                        £15,830,000

Scheme 2.

BRITISH STEAMERS TRADING TO HOLLAND.

Early in the war, arrangements were made with the General Steam Navigation Company to maintain a regular service of steamers to Holland with a view to encouraging the importation of Dutch dairy and other produce into this country. The vessels could not be insured by one of the War Risks Associations in the ordinary way because the voyages to Dutch ports were prohibited voyages under the Insurance Scheme, and it was arranged that the Board of Trade should insure those vessels themselves at a reasonable rate. A similar arrangement was made in December, 1914, with the Croat Eastern Railway Company, and the arrangement was subsequently extended in May, 1915, to all British vessels engaged in the Trade with Holland.

Premium received up to date    £403,000

Losses                         £620,000

Debit Balance                  £217,000

SAILING SHIPS,     Tho Insurance Scheme formulated by tho Sub-Committoo ofthe Committoo of  Imperial Dofonoo applied only to stoamorsebut it was subsequently arranged that tho oversea sailing ship might bo reinsured by tho Government.  Arrangements woroaccordingly made  for tho roinsurance by tho Govornraont of a proportion of the, risk: on tho vessels ontorod iu tho SailingShips War Risks Association.  On voyages ourrent at tho out-break of war 60$ of -the risk was roinsurod by tho government without premium.

The promiums wore fixed by the Board of Trado, and 80 of tho risk was reinsured &quot;T*Y&apos;the Government.

In August 191V,  arrangements were made for tho rein-suranco by tho Government of tho small coasting and. other vessels entered in two Mutual War Risks Associations.  Thorates were time, rates, and varied according to the trade inwhich tho vessel was engaged.  Seventy por cent, of therisk was reinsured by tho ^ovornmont.Premiums , 0.............  133,000Losses..................   72,000
Scheme  6*HULIS OP flORWSGIAN SIPSAMSRS.     Up till October 1916 all Norwegian steamers  wore  in-sured by tho Lorwegian War Associations but the losses hadbeen so heavy that the Association deolined to  continue  andit was necessary for      Government to provide; insurance on Norwegian vessels.     From October 1916 to this date all Norwegian steametrsengaged In Allied trades have been insured by H.M.  Govern-ment.     The rates of insurance have varied in accordance  withthe activity of  the submarines.   In agreement with the  Frenchantf Italian Governments it was arranged that the  three coun-tries, England, Pranoe and Italy should share in  the Under-writing liabilities and that the insurance premium receivedshould be credited to and the losses debited to the countryin whose interest the steamer Insured was trading.     The premium received from October 1916 to the  lastaccount prepared was over   5,000,000.     The position as per account prepared to 30th November1918 is that there is   standing to the credit of E.M. Govera-ment tbe sum of gr. 91.489^000.     There  are a oertain number of steamers lost  for whtohpayment has not  for various reasons yet been made.  In  someoases the steamer is missing end it is not known  whetherthe 1O.JH is due  to war or Marine risk and in other oades. thesteamers have been lost through collision in convoy wherethe same doubt exists.     Makinc? what is considered ample provision for theseoutstanding oasos it is . thought that the result will be  a profit of about  2,000,,000.     In viev; of the arrangement mentioned above that ..5ngLan&amp;,Pranee and  Italy participate in the Underwriting  the resultas between  the different countries will be as follows:-SVanoe - profit ofItaly - profit of  ,500,000 1.000,000Inland ** loss of 3.500,0001,500,000 2.000.000
                                  Scheme  7,HULLS OF NORWEGIAN STEAMERS (M5W SCHEMES) *     On and after lgth August 1918 it was  arranged thatNorwegian steamer a should &quot;be insured in sterling at theWar Risks Offioe and the figures from that date  are keptseparate.     Premium received from       12th August to 30th November,1918     5,026,924. 19.  9.

There may be certain outstanding losses to be de-ducted from the balance.     As in the first Norwegian schema the premium iscredited and the losses debited to France, Italy and england.     It is considered that the result when the  account isfinally wound up and all outstanding losses paid will result ija a profit of about  3,500,000.     It is estimated that this profit will be  divided between the countries interested in the foIUcwing per--centages:-            France ...  50$  -   1,750,000            Italy  ...  30$  -   1,050,000            England,..  20$  -     700,000                                             Scheme  8.            EICE3S VALUES OF NORWEGIAN STEAMERS.     The original Norwegian Scheme limited the  value ofthe steamer which was to bo insured by E.M, Government.The Shipowners complained that this value was not hi^aanough and H.il. Government eventually agreed to insureexcess values and theresult is roughly as follows:-     Premium received to&apos;1&quot;&apos;1&quot;&apos;          30th November  1918 *,         2,188,142.  7. 4.

     It is not anticipated that there will be any out-standing liability of a serious nature and that in all probability there will be a profit of........ 1,400.000and of this the percantages to the different oountnesare as follows.;-France      45$  *   630,000Italy       30$  s   420,000.England     ZSfo  B   350,000.Scheme 9*HULLS AND CARGO OF OTHER NEUTRAL STEAMERS.     Early in December 1916 it was quite evident that unless insurance was provided for the Hulls of neutralsteamers (other than Norwegian steamers for whioh in-surance had already been provided) the steamers wouldnot engage in Allied trades.   The underwriters atLloyds and in the open market were quoting very high rates, which rates the Neutral Steam Ship Owners were unable to pay in consequence of the Limited rate of freight Scheme at that t^me in existence,   It was alsoevident that the facilities in the open market for in-suring oargo in the said steamers were not sufficient andShippers were in difficulties consequent on their beingunaole to insure the cargoes fully.     Immediate steps were required to provide thenecessary insurance and as it would have taken time tomake the necessary arrangements for the insurance to beeffected at the War Risks Office an arrangement was madewith the Comasroial Union Assurance Company that theywould accept liability on the Hull and Cargo (as mentioned oelow) on behalf of HJfu Government at rates to be fixed by the Board of Trade.     1. For Insurance of Hulls of all Neutral Steamers,     2, For Insurance of Cargo in those steamers        provided such cargo could not be insured in        the open market consequent on the high value        to be insured.     On 1st January 1918 it was agreed to release theCommercial Union Assurance Company ijrom the obligationreferred to and the vessels and cargoes were insured atthe War Risks Office.
     The figures below embrace the period during whichliability was  accepted on behalf of H.M.  Government  by  theCommercial Union and also the period that the Insurance wa3placed direct  with  the War lUsks Office.      Total premium reoeived  poupjily *****   8,500,000.      Total Claims  paid  including known        outstanding Liabilities...........   7,200,000.                   Balance in hand.........^300^000.   .  An arrangement was made with Prance and Italy similarto that mentioned in  the Norwegian Scheme (No.-6) that  the premium 3hould be credited  and losses debited to France,England and Italy,     The result is likely  to be as follows        England will  be  in  credit about          850,000        Prance    11    &quot;  11    11     11            650,000                   ;                          i^oo^ooo        Italy will be in debit about             200,000                                           &quot;&quot;&quot;iilsoolooo.                                              Scheme  10.,     TOtig OF mmm  mmm in wm mm ays,     A certain number  of British Free Steamers were engagedin the Goal Trade to France.  Prior to August 1917 thesesteamers were insured  in one or other of the far &quot;JJiskAssociations, which associations were reinsured by H.M.Government to the extent of QOjo of their liability.     In August 1917 a  new  arrangement was made with the WarBisk Associations and  it was agreed that the British freeSteamers engaged  in the French&apos;Coal Trade should be insuredv/ith the War Risks Office.     The premium  on the steamers in the Prenah Coal Tradewas to be credited to  France and losses debited to thatcountry,                                      .       *     Premium received  to 30th November, 1918     735;000.
