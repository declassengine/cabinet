Confidential.                  Political Intelligence Department                                          Foreign Office.January 16th, 1^19.                                            Germany/030.            , iCKE  ML ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IH GERMANY.     Concurrently with the preparations for the election of anational Constituent Assembly for all Germany, elections aretaking place for representative assemblies in the States whiohwere formerly federated in the German Empire and which stillprovisionally desire to remain thus federated.     Among the results which have already been announced inone form or another is that for the former Duchy of Brunswick,where the total number of votes recorded for each party hasbeen published.     The voting was as follows       Social Democratic Party........................ 44,110       Independent Socialists................... 42,750       National Electoral Union (Parties of the Right) 43,560       Democratic Party (Union of Non-Socialist Rad*-       icals and liberals)......,...................... 38,120     It is not stated upon what system the election;:, was con-ducted, but under Revolutionary auspices it is certain to havebeen universal suffrage, probably with proportional represent-ation.  In any case it has been announced that the victory of social Democracy may be regarded as &quot;assured&quot;.  The IndependentSocialists, it will be observed, have polled nearly as manyvotes as the Majority section.  This in accordance with theturbulent conditions now prevailing in Brunswick, where, accord-ing to the latest accounts, the provisional RevolutionaryGovernment has been overthrown by the loe:.l Workmen and Soldiersand only tine Minority (independent) Socialist member has been left in office.
      In Bavaria the results of the prelMnaryvelaoldxmfl^.,&apos;tna^n0ttimje^^                       been publish e d.      These are as follows:-        Bavarian People&apos;s Party,  fin the main, the          Catholic Centre, which  under the old          realms was the Government Party)............. 754,474Majority Socialists....................,.......- 696,433German Democratic Party, (Liberal-Eadical  Coalition).............................^^^LZ^IBZBavarian peasants  League (Progressive Land  Reformers)................................... 250,238Independent (Minority) Socialists.............,  87,593National Liberals (rather reactionary).........  &amp;6r153Non-commissioned officers1 Party (probably a  Soviet Hump).................................   9,236So-called Middle-class Party (composed of small  shopkeepers, independent handicraftsmen,^etc.  The German  &quot;Mittelstand&apos; has been largely&quot;Pan-  German, Militarist, and Anti-Semitic)........   3,180     A Berne telegram to the &quot;Times&quot; states that seats willprobably be allotted as follows:-         Bavarian Peoplefs Party (Catholic Centre   55         Majority Socialists.......................50         German Lemocratic Party (liberal&apos; Radical            Coalition)............................  28         Peasants League..........................  18         National Liberals........................   7         Independent Minority Socialists..........   4     These Bavarian results show that, as had been expected,the Bavarian^Catholics retain their numerical preponderant^It remains to be seen whether they will succeed in re-establish-ing their parliamentary supremacy, and, if they do, for whatpurpose they will employ it.  Confidential reports which havebeen received differ as to the forces at work in Iiunichfor reaction on the one hand and revolution on the other.The Crown Prince Rupprecbt is reported to have returned from holland, where he had taken refuge, and to be awaiting events,in the midst of r following of some 2,000 Bavarian officers.
^The ex-JCLng  udwig is living at one of bd,s--cas&quot;tlee on the Starnberger See.   It is stated,, however,  that the Gatholio Party in its prke^mdaxad^Lng.;-el^raents is quite averse from playing with reaction,  e;s tbe peasantry will have none of it. If a Government  composed, even in part, of Catholic Deputies were to favour reaction,  the forces which  made the Bavarian Revolution on November  8th,  1918,  would probably sweep it&apos; away by violence.   If a Government like the present Provisional one, composed partly of Socialists, partly of Boursei.3 Democrats  were set up,  the  question would  be whether the  more extreme elements  in the Workmen and Soldiers&apos;  Councils would not demand a fresh coup dJeta1:..    According to some reports the extreme Spartacus clioue in Munich does not number more than 50, while other accounts represent Bolshevist money  and Spartacus  emissaries as having achieved considerable  success among the  urban proletariat..  All  that can be said is  that  if the result of the  elections  should be  reflooted in the composi- tion of a  new Government  and if that Government can maintain itself against the subversive elements, Bavaria ought  to  be one of the most conservative or  moderating elements in the future political  life of  Germany,      The German Wireless  further announces the result  of  the elections  for the  Wurttemberg Assembly in  the form of  the number of  deputies returned  by the different parties.  These are: -           Social Democrats.......................  52           German  (non-Socialist) Democrats.......  38           Catholic Centre.........................  31           Co/la i t i 0\ r f  the R i gh t.................25           Independent Social Democrats.,.........   4      It is added  that the Majority Democrats received 452,450 votes, the Independent Socialists  only 40,622. The Democrats  (Radicals)  polled  328,555,
     The prospect in wurttemberg is that a Majority Soci&amp;Xis !;Government will &quot;be constituted with perhaps some infusion ofbourgeois Democrats.   Sinct the outbreak of the Revolutionthe Independent Socialists and the party of disorder havehot Bhowh themselves strong enough to attempt even sporadicdisturbances.  Wurttemberg will continue to supply importantsupport to -moderate aocialisio--or&quot;advanced Radicalism in theEBpira. *v     So far as the State elections have gone they seemto confirm the view that the elections for the German national assembly will result in a&apos;strong Majority Socialist party, a fairly fct:rorig..non*&amp;^                  party, and a CathollaCentre ^arty of about the sane strength as that which sat inthe old keiohstag, - say. 100 members *  The NaUon^NAS4*esabl^Will consist of 432 members, ef whom 150 to 200 may well be  .Majority Socialists;  80 to 100 non-Sooial l)e *ocr8ts, and 80to 100 Catholic Centre.   The reactionary parties will do wel,if they return anything between 20 to 40 representatives;  theIndependent Socialists will hardly number a fcore and the SparVaeus Group will be practically nowhere*     &quot;The elections for the Constituent Assembly of Prussiaare fixed for January 26th;  they will probably result inthe return of a large Socialist Lajcrity in which thefectreme elements, though, perhaps, not dangerously strong,will be numerically more powerful than in the German Nationalia*emblyv  In the present chaotic constitutional situation The German papers and public speakers continue to refer the &quot;Empire&quot;^(Reich)and to the &quot;Imperial Government&quot;, mean-tug thereby the territorial extent of the late German. Empireand not any institutions and tendencies, which can be repjf&amp;edas &quot;Imperial&quot;  in the reactionary men&amp;ing of that word.
