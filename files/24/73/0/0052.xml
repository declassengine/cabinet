The total number demobilisedfrom the Forces  represents 6e$$ of the total strength onthe 11th November,  1918.   The maximum number demobilisedfrom the Army on any one day during the period covered bythis review was  14,589;  but during the next few days this figure should be materially improved upon.         The  analysis  of the numbers demobilised is considerably behind the actual work of demobilisation,
so that It is net possible to give figures up to thesame date analysed, on the one hand as regards Com-mands or Expeditionary Forces, or on the other, asregards Industrial groupings.  As at present analysedthe fugures show that 41,70CV Officers and Other Rankshave been demobilised from tho Army in Frahceo  It isknown, however, that since the date of $he Armistice84,900 have arrived in this Country for purposes  ofdemobilisation, the majority of whom will have been already demobilised.  In addition 11,000 have beendemobilised whilst on leave, and there are others hav-ing extended leave&apos;which may lead to the same result.           T he question of the release of Pivotal menand. Demobilisers Is one which is receiving special attention.   The following table shoua the ^progress which has been made in obtaining the release of thesemen from the Army and the Wavy5-ARMY.Pivotal meiioDemobiliaers:NAVY,Pivotal men.Demobilisers      Names      Releaseput forward by   Orders  Labour Dept.

representing something like 100,000 cards, and these will doubtless contain a proportion of Pivotal menand Pemobilisers.         The following table shows the progress indealing with Civil Employment forms for Officers andMen in H.ivi.

Unemployment is still on the increase; but   the rate of increase is somewhat less than during the   preceding weeks.  The total number of Out-of-Vork   Donation Policies issued up to the 3rd January amounts   to 604,136]  but of these, only 380,000 remained locked   on that date. - The rate of increase in the, number of   policies remaining lodged has fallen from a steady   70,000 per week, which obtained in the early weeks of   December, to an average of 55,000 per week during each   of the last two weeks.  Of the 380,000 Policies re-   malning lodged on the 3r0 January, 238,000 are issued   to women and girls..Officers    I en, 26,956   1,132,277 26,868  .   942,974 19,737       6,486 15,677       6,486

Although the total amount of unemployment continuesto increase and must do so for some time, there are re-assuring signs of industrial development.        Thepercentage of Out-of-Work Donation Policies remainingloaded to total Policies issued had steadily fallen sincethe 13th December in the case of both men and women, thusindicating a rise in the rato of absorption of labour.The figures are as follows j-      Percentage of Policies Lodged to Policies Issued.
Subject to the consideration of one or two minor ques-tions , the Treasury has approved the principle thatthe whole of the abnormal cost of providing the houses in excess of that covered by Id, rate, shall be borneby the Exchequer,   This question, however, is not yetagreed so far as Scotland and Ireland are concerned.There is prospect of a minimum of 150,000 houses beingproceeded with at.the earliest possible moment;  but these by no means exhaust the building capacity of theLocal Authorities,          The restrictions on building have not yet.been removed, as the Ministry of Munitions and theBoard of Trade are not yet in agreement as to whetherIt is possible to control the maximum prices withoutthe permit system.   The question will be discussed at a meeting of Ministers to be held this week.                            (Signed)  Eric Geddes,
