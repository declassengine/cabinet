I am commanded by tho Army Council to inform you that their attention has been drawn to a memorandum prepared by the Board of Trade on tho subject of themaintenance of the censorship^which was circulated to themembers of tho ?&apos;ar Cabinet on the 17th December, 1918,          In this memorandum the sentence occurs:  &quot;thocensorship involves the holding; up of telegrams for clayseven for an entirely unforeseeable number of days&quot;.  this statement, if meant to be of general application, appearsto disclose a complete misapprehension of the methodsunder which the cable censorship is vorhed, and is probablybased on the fact that for some time past telegraphic correspondence to many destinations has been subject tovery serious operative delays (amounting to as much as 10days in the case of the near and far T,1ast) on account ofinterruptions to cables and other causes over which the censorship has no control.   These delays have by thepublic been wrongly attributed to the censorship.          As a matter of fact and practice the  delaysactually involved by censorship amount to under half an hour in the case of plain language telegrams, and one to two hours in the case of telegrams in authorised codewhich have to be decoded.          It is true that delays  (usually fi::ed at 18hours) have been imposed as a matter of military policy on telegrams destined for countries in Purope in touch.with enemy territory, but  this is not a necessary oressential feature of censorship in itself, and underemsting conditions would have been removed by now,but for objections raised by the French Government,          The only other cases where messages aredelayed through censorship are those in which governmentdepartments mahe requests that telegrams relating tocertain specified commodities should not in the publicinterest be transmitted or delivered until the  department concerned has had an opportunity  of expressing  an opiniowSuch reference involves a delay dependent not on the censorship but on the rapidity with which that  opinion is c ommunic ated *                       I have the honour to be,                                Sir,                       Your  obedient Servant,(Sgd.)B*,D.
