I (htt1-T&apos;id Document Is the Property ofBritannic Majesty^ -Government.)MEMORANDUM FOR WAR CABINET.HOUSING&quot;.     I desire to associate myself with the views expressed by Mr. Chamber la in in his suggestions onthe Memorandum on Housing by the President of theLocal Government Board, and to make one or two additionalsuggestions myself.     While I agree with Mr.Chamberlain that theScheme proposed by the President may be successful  inthe large urban areas, at the same time,  if I rightlyunderstand his proposals, I am alarmed at the magnitude of the new Department which he proposes to set up.   Ithink this will be very much criticised in the country where an extension of bureaucracy is not  at all desired,and, for my part, I believe that the Town Councils  intho Cities aril larger towns arc fully competent to  do thework efficiently if they have the necessary financialatyuistance;   while in the rural area,., the County councils are obviously the- proper authority..     With Mr.Chamberlain I hold most strongly that not only aw  a. matter of justice but in order that thework may be  well and promptly done, it i      ontialthat any assistance given to utility societies shouldalso be given to the private o?/ner, and I hold also   Nwith Mr. Chamberlain that the proposals I  made in-theCabinet seme months ago were at that, timeadopted
si68adopted by the Cabinet,  they were certainly cordiallyapproved by the Prime Minister.   It is not unreason-able to hope that one result of the abolition of ordinary party politics  will be to get rid of the oldand, as I think, foolish prejudice against the agri-cultural owner.   I  believe that if an impartial in-quiry were made throughout the country generally itwould be found that  the  best and lowest rented cottagesare to be found on the estates of  the agriculturalowners, and if what  is really  required is the provisionof cottages of a suitable character and in the bestpositions., ?,h.;n it is undoubtedly  necessary to securethe hearty co-operation of the owners,   This can onlybe done if  they are treated with common fairness.          There are, however,  other questions connectedwith the building of houses which  require the immediateattention of the Government  if the problem is to be solved satisfactorily in country districts.   first and foremost of these is the  question of water supply.It is very hard upon the agricultural owner if he isto be called upon at his own  cost  to  provide watersupply for cottages in ports  of  the  country where wateris very difficult to get and has frequently to be                                           brou&amp;ht
brought very long distances.  In some areas,  largely owing to the action of the owners themselves,  water supplies have been.provided by the locality.   this and a proper system of drainage ought to be universal,and the coat should not be borne solely by the locality.,as it is in the interests of the public health of thenation that this work should be properly done;  and where the cost is excessive and beyond the power ofthe locality to meet, some assistance ought to be given.          Further, it is urgently necessary that beforethe Government seek to compel the erection of working-class houses steps should be taken to make it obligatoryon County Councils, District Councils, Railway -and post Office authorities to find houses for their ownemployees.   At present, there is hardly a village of ,more than 150 or 300 people where it will not be foundthat from two to even six or seven cottages provided bythe local landowners are occupied by men employed bythese Authorities.   This is clearly wrong, and nothing would more  immediately assist in the provision ofcottages in the country districts than an alteration inthis.vary unsatisfactory and unjust condition of things.       I know the  risk of delay which attaches&apos;tc any form of inquiry, but I confess I am not a little afraid that unless practical experience ici more largely availed                                                    of
of than at: cm likely to be tho case these housingbchemos will in all probability fail and not  onlybring discredit upon the. Government but bitterdisappointmont in tho country whore tho need  for houoeio fully appreciated and where there exists a generalimprecision that a real practical scheme is to be initiated which will deal satisfactorily with thL.grave evil.COLONIAL OFFICE,f .H.L.     7 i 1 * 19 e
