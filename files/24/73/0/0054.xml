3sVT193FORTNIGHTLY REPORT ON  REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONSPU.            IH  THE UNITED  KINGDOM AND  MORALE ABROAJ.tiOi*)             ----&apos;                (Circulated  hy the Home  Secretary,)      The heavy  defeat  of the Extremists at the General Election is having the effect that was anticipated.   On the plea that the House of Commons cannot he trusted to  give a  fair hearing to the grievances of the working- classes, they are all  for &quot;direct action&quot; and thoy are snatching at  the opportunity offered by the unrest in the Array to further corrupt its morale in tho hope of  bringing revolution  nearer*   Thus, &quot;The Herald&quot; has  come out with a front page  in huge  capitals &quot;THE GREAT MUTINY (full story&apos;1), and two columns from  its special correspondent at Folkestone, written in the style with  which  &quot;The Herald&quot; has made us familiar6      1&apos;heir second trump card is the Allied intervention in Russia, and this is being rather  skilfully worked.   A leaflet &quot;Hands Off Russia&quot; is being circulated by the London Workers1 Committee, and a Committee has been formed called the &quot;Hands Vff Russia Committee&quot; at 7, Featherstone Buildings, Holborn,  by Arthur  kacManus and Ramsay, Watson, Sylvia  Pankhurst and other Extremists,  The  Hon, President is N. Lenin, and the lion. Vice Presidents, Liebknecht, Trotsky and Clara  Zetkin, but there is a naive note to the effect that owing  tft the  bad postal arrangements their formal consent has not been obtained.      MacManus,  speaking at  Sheffield  on  the  29th  c  December said that if the Government tried to shift  any  soldiers to Russia  fron Aberdeen they would copy Havelock 7/ilson&apos;s tactics  and call  out the Marine Engineers.      A  meeting is to be held on January  18th at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, and a  seoond meeting  at the Albert Hall in  February by the British  Socialist Party, who have embossed upon their letter of application  to the Direotors .   a  red flag,    It  will be  remembered that Fairchildj the Secretary,  was closely in touoh with Litvincff  and is believed  to  have received money from him.    At those  meetings  there will be a  large gathering  of ^Russian Jews from the  East End, and  all the well known Extremists are  likely to be  presents  A Resolution will probably be passed  threatening a  general strike unless the Allied Forces are recalled,       James Winstone,  the defeated Candidate for Merthyr,  addressing a  meeting on the 29th December had a Resolution passed calling for  industrial aotion, unless intervention in Russia, and the occupation of  Germany oeased forthwith.       Extremists  such  as Peet, and Kealey say that they are disgusted with  the- workers  and if they cannot get them to do the right thing politically.  they must take industrial action,       Tho Extremists  dislike the 47 hour week because it was granted by the  employers without a  strike, and it therefore makes it difficult for them  to paint the employers in the black oclours&apos;which are their stook in trade.
        Tho queues that have already begun in Birmingham outside  the  butcher1   shops and at the out-of-wcrk Pay Offioes are  soed  ground for the   Extremists.   In Birmingham the people are grumbling  at the continuance   of the 50$ rise in railway fares,                                                                       *        Supporters of John McLean aro beginning  to realise that he  is   mentally unsound.   He is advertised to speak in South Wales this  month,        Mr, Lansbury has been invited to Paris by Colonel House,    The   reason is not knownj  it may bo in connection with hit&apos; d^clrration^  in   favour of the League of Hations.        The Industrial Workers of the V/crld aro  issuing  a Shilling  Loan Woie   of which I have a oopy.   The money is to be  devoted  to the &quot;Class War&quot;   and is supposed to be repaid at the end of three months.  A member  claims   to have sold notes it the value of  9 in one  day.        A Sooialist War iuap is being distributed in the  workshops in   Manchester.   The portions of the globe which it is believed that  the   Allies intend to annex are coloured in black.        On the other hand, Mr-, Victor Fisher has been doing good  work in   speaking against Bolshevism and revolutionary syndicalism, and the spirit   that oarried the reoent elections i3 by no means evaporated,,   At  Loed3   a widely advertised meeting, called to support the Russian Revolution,   attracted only twenty hearers,UNREST IN THE ARMY.        It would he foolish to make .light of the serious effect of  the   recent demonstrations by doldiers, particularly in Prance, where the   people oannot understand temporising with what they regard as  mutiny.   The trouble may bo largely asoribed to the action  of  a few newspapers.   My correspondents abroad have been pointing out for some time  the  bad  -   effect on the troops of the Paris odition of  &apos;&apos;The  Daily Mail&quot;, with  its   Labour column and its articles on Demobilisation.   Unfortunately, it  has   been practically the only paper accessible to the  troops day by  day? and   though, undoubtedly, the heart of the Army is sound,  the recent   demonstrations and the Police strike show how a determined minority  of   Extremists can stampede the quiet men into insubordination.        The wildest rumours are being circulated.  In Sheffield  they are   saying that at a recent meeting of naval ratings at the Crystal  Palace   eight officers were shot and all the men were discharged, and  that the   trouble began by some men&apos;being shot for refusing  to  go to Russia.        Soldiers&apos;on leave talking in railway carriages aro doing  harm by  de-   claring that there is no discipline left in the Army, as for  instance, at   Brussels a battery refused to clean the guns  and went unpunished.    They   aro even boasting of getting home with property &quot;looted&quot; from the   officers.        Another rumour is to the effect that at  Havre tho A.S.C  refused  to
   shoot at men of tho R.G.A.,  that the  offioers  opened fire, the men replied,   and many casualties ensued.        A rumour is also being circulated  that a  National  strike is arranged   to take place in February,  but this has been ascertained to be untrue.   There is, however,  to be a  Shop Stewards&apos;  Conference at an early date.                         MORALE IN FRANCE.        There has been, unfortunately, a deoline  in  the morale of all the   Allied troops during the past fortnight, les3  perhaps among the French   than either the British or  the Amerioans.        The insubordination which began  at Folkestone  on January 4th has   been reported in the press.    There was no violence.    It is now evident   that the demonstrators have forfeited the  sympathy  of the Public and   this will have a strong moral effect.        No doubt the faot that oertain French classes  have already been   demobilised is having its effect upon tho  British troops.        The granting of Christmas leave  to the troops  in England caused   serious dissatisfaction in France;  the feeling being that they should   have been sent out to relieve the men who  had  done  the  fighting.        Increasing interest seems to be  shown in  the educational scheme.        The allowance fixed by the French  Government for the mutiles is   giving great dissatisfaction.   In Paris disabled men are t* be seen  on   the boulevards as hawkers,  and this is  producing  a  very bad effeot.   Although no disturbance is  anticipated  where the  men are under military   law, trouble may be expected when they  are demobilised.  There seems to   be no adequate transport for French soldiors on leave from the Front.        The French civil morale continues  to  be satisfactory, in spite of   the breakdown in the distribution of  food  in the  regions lately evacuated   by the enemy,BELGIUM.        There is indignation against the Government  for what is oonsidered   their laxity in dealing with traitors at Courtrai.   There have been   demonstrations against notorious Flamingants,  and if definite action  Is   not taken s*on it is prcbable that the  houses  of  the most notorious   suspects will be looted and destroyed.   There is a feeling that the  rich   traitor is allowed to go free whilst  the poor  suffers,   Thore is besides   great disappointment at tho continuance of high prices, but this is   directed more against the farmer than against  the Government.
                              BOLSHEVISM ABROAD.RUSSIA-        Owing to the laok of internal communication it  is  very difficult  to   obtain news from tho interior.        An informant recently returned from Petrograd,  states  that the   bourgeoisie parties havo made complete arrangements  for the Municipal   Government of  etregrad in the event of the town being  occupied by   Allied Forces.    Arrangements have been made  for tho electric  and   water power stations to bo kept going, and the Mayer and Councillors   are ready to take office.        The population daily expects the landing  of Allied trocps  and, in   the opinion of the informant, it is essential  that the  Allies  should   immediately declare their policy, fa.&quot; the alternative raising  and   damping of the hopes of the population is gradually  driving them to   despair.   It is thought that British prestige, which still ranks  high   amongst the Russian eduoated olass, will suffer irreparablo damage by   what they ofcnsider to be a vacillating polioy.   Even the announcemant   that no armed intervention will take place this year can now ds little   harm, in that it must now be generally recognised that  the  season  is too   late for fighting in the neighbourhood of Petrograd,   It is thought   oortain that if ever  -Allied troops approach Petrograd  largo nur-ibera of   the Rod Army will desert, owing to a considerable proportion of tho   Army having joined merely to obtain food,   According to a  high   Russian Military Officer, who is connected with the  commissariat   department, the Red Army is well armed as regards rifles, and  generally   well equipped.   There is little likelihood of a shortage of rifles   owing to a considerable stock of English barrels being  available,   A   large stock of small shells also exists, and up till reoently  a pro-   gramme for the construction of artillery was under debate;  the  guns   manufactured in the works near *petrograd have  been a complete  failure,   owing to defects in the  mochanisn.        Food oonditions in Petrograd are deplorable? and things have  grcwu   infinitely worse during the last two months,   Urratioxied food can, h&apos;.w-   ever, still bo obtained in sooret restaurants at fabulous price;  The   finanoial situation is even more serious;  there is  a  great shortage of   vurre^cy.   The informant Btatos that it was no uncommon sight to  see   soldiers recognising officers as crossing sweepers,  and having oolleoted   a orowd, stabbing them to doath in the main thoroughfares.        Tho German Scadiers&apos; Council at Moscow has sent a  congratulatory   telegram to John McLean of Glasgow, .        It io reported by M, Skovenius, lately Danish Minister in Moscow,   that Indians who have been living in Germany have been  invited  to  Mospcw   to receive money and instructicna for Bolshevik propaganda  in  India.   Chinese labourers and Japanese are to be used  in the same way  for  their
5.195    respective countries.   The Indian Government has been warned.         The reports of &quot;The Times&quot;&apos; special correspondent in Sweden about    the growing strength of the Bolshevik regime should be accepted with    caution.   People were talking in the came strain about the  French    Revolution and the hopelessness of recovery 120 years ago,GERMANY.         Despite the confusion of1 the last few days of civil war in Berlin    it seems likely that the forces of order will prevail.   On  November    20th The Soldiers1 Council of the Fourth Army issued a Llanifeoto de-    nounoing Bolshevism in unmeasured language? and the Government  seems    still able to count upon the support cf loyal troops.SWITZERLAND.         Efforts are being made to induce the Municipality of Lausanne to    refuse permission for the National Socialist Congress to be  held there,         The Swiss are recalling their Minister from Petrograd,  although    they estimate that the temporary sacrifice of Swiss interests  in Russia    may amount to a milliard of franos.   The Government thinks  that all    Bolshevik elements have now been expelled iron Lausanne, and they are    only waiting the result of the enquiry into the oauses of the  recent    strike, in order to deal with the Bolshevik elements at Berne  and Zuricho         The Swiss General Staff are anxious to have the cooperation of the    British General Staff in combating Bolshevism in Switzerland.         It is reported that some millions of francs have recently been    deposited in the name of the wife of the Russian Consul at Geneva in- the .    Ban^uc Internationale de Petrograd.ITALY.         The Italians are now suffering from a spasm of self-glory:   they    have &apos;won the war&apos; not because of, but in spite of Allied help.    They    demand the Adriatio Coast; and if they hate any people mere  than the    French it is the Jugo-Slavs, beside whom the Germans and Austrianc were    quite tolerable.         The propaganda movement emanating from Switzerland is still active,    but it may be doubted whether the reports of large transfers  of  money  from    Germany for revolutionary purposes in Italy are correct.  Signor 1,&apos;itti    made an exhaustive investigation in the various banks, and could not    ascertain that any transfers of money on a large scale were  being made    from Switzerland to Italy; at the came time he  admitted that  the Secret    Police work was being very badly done.   He said that the Government had    now decided to appoint Signor Vicenzo Quranta,  a Prefeot of  Bologna, to    organise the Surete Publique,    He did not apprehend much internal trouble    in Italy.         It seems that the Italian Government has now taken serious  alarm,    and has instructed its Diplomatic agents to pay particular attention to    .  I    Bolshevik activities.    Unfortftnutely they know very little  about the
SPAIN.     Though the King does not seem to be personally unpopular, and the disturbances!in Spain are Separatist rather than Revolutionary, the outlook is certainly dis-quieting,   The upper classes are thoroughly frightened; there is a continualsuccession of meaningless strikes in which the quiet men are driven like sheepbefore a handful of agitators.   The King is believed to be weary of Office, andthe conditions both in Spain and in Portugal are such that a shrewd banker, whohas lately returned after surveying the prospects of opening a new banking businesslin the Iberian Peninsular, states his firm belief that in ten years intervention by the stable Powers of Europe will be necessary to retrieve the country fromanarchy.   The Seville Conservatives believe that the agitators come from Barcelona!and are French Republicans, but it is far more likely that they are syndicalist,and that such money as is required comes from Socialists in the Argentine.     A Revolutionary leaflet, inoiting the soldiers to mutiny and to treat women and girls as oommon property has been distributed by thousands amongst the Spanish!troops.   The Authorities were able to confiscate some two thousand of them, whioh Iwere already in the hands of the men; some were surrendered voluntarily, others were only obtained by disciplinary action,,   In the Leon region soldiers were found in possession of other Bolshevik sheets, and one of them apparently had money!for which he&apos;eould not aocount.   Two sergeants and ten soldiers were put underarrest. &quot;13th January, 1919, tB*H.T&apos;T8ub,]eot, and do not appear to have got further than the belief that Scandinaviansailors are being employed by the Bolsheviks as agents.     The Vatican also is alarmed, and io making overtures to the Quirinal inorder that they may join hands in resisting the forces of disorder.   An ex-ohange of official archives has already taken place between the Governments, onthe initiative of the Vatican,     The s6t-back to the Bolsheviks in Switzerland has reacted upon northern italy where the situation is certainly more stable than it was two months ago.
