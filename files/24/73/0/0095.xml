efefe .X7,, 689 6HINISTEY OF SHIPPINGOAS TING TRADE &amp; RAID AY COIAPI-TITIOH     The Shipping Controller desires to draw the attention ofthe V,ar Cabinet to the attached Memorandum by Sir Norman Hill,the Chairman.of the Port and Transit Committee/     The Situation created by the present disparity between the coasting freights and the railway rates is a very serious one.Railway rates on goods traffic remain, with few exceptions., at present -war level, and the traffic is being carried on at an enormousloss.   Consequently, as the Port and Transit Committee pointout, it will be quite impossible for coasting tonnage to operate in competition with the railways unless a substantial increase is made in railway rates.     The matter is most urgent and the Shipping Controller asksthat it may receive tae early consideration of the &quot;^ar Cabinet.23rd January, 1919
PORT AND TRANSIT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEETHE COASTING TRADE OF THE UNI TED KINGDOM.     MEMORANDUM BY SIR JjCgjaN, HILL.     On the 27th April 1918 power was given to th$ Board ofTrade under the Dofenco cf the Realm Regulation 7 B (1)  Kts Isauo an Order &quot;for enabling Hidlway Companies to refuseto accept goods for oarri&amp;ga hy rail where other moans  oftransport exist, subject to such conditions as may fee prescribed by the Order&quot;,  This Order has been drafted, but not issued.     The Port Authorities In the great ports&apos;which deal withnoarly 90$ of the total Imports of tho united Kingdom,  arcunanimous that the facilities for distribution by the CoastingServices as they now exist, must be improved before they willbe able to deal with anything approaching the volume cf importsthat passed through those ports under peace conditions.     These ports must have the advantage of both land and seadistribution to enable them to give the ocean going ships the quickest possible turnaround.        t     Under peace conditions the Railways and Coasting Serviceswero in competition.     The running expenses in both Services have increased .enormously, in wages, coal, stores and upkeep,     Until the Armistice, the Coasting Services were furtherhandicapped by War Risk Insurance cn both the ships and their cargoes *     In the case of the Railways the increase in the operatingcost falls -aim?3t entirely on the Stato^ as peace rates have been practically maintained at the cost of  the Tax Payers,     In the case of the Coasting Services this increase inthe  operating  cost has to be: covcrod by the freights, andthese have been substantially advanced,     -It follows that the Ccasting Services  are no longerabfe-jto cempet-e, ^eommercisSiv, for the traffic,  and that thefo&amp;pjfteiera use  their utmost ende&amp;vburs to g&amp;t  all their cargoes8eni forward by rail to their ultimate destination.     During the war these  factors resulted  in.- (1)     Detention of the  ocean going  steamships  in the ports        and consequent loss of carrying power. (2)     Congestion  on  the  Quays (3)     Congestion  on  the  Railways
     The work of the Home Trade Transport Control Committee,and of the Local Committees It has established. In theprincipal ports, has met with considerable success,  in getting traffic transferred back to the Coasting Servicesand on to Canals.  The last figures available are as under:- .     Traffic diverted from rail to water transit         July      1918, ............   76,959 tons         August      &quot;............   92,557  &quot;         September   &quot;   ............   65,378  &quot;         October     &quot;   ............  113,081  &quot;But the work of the Committee has been handicapped by  reasonof the absence of any authority to enforce its instructions.     So long as the War lasted the Importers were ready  to respond to appeals to relieve the railways of traffic  that could be carried coastwise, and moreover the Importers werenot fully alive to the fact that the Board of Trade  had  notexercised its powers, and that therefore the Railways  werenot in a position to refuse the traffic.   .  Now that the stimulus of winning the war has ceased tobe operative, the Importers are challenging the right  ofthe Committee to divert traffic to the Coasting Services atfreights considerably in excess of the Railway Rates.   .  Additional tonnage Is becoming available for the coasting Services but there is no chance of even the tonnagenow available being offered at freights fixed in competition with the Railway Rates - that is so l ng as the railway rates remain on practically a peace basis.  Other employment,as for example the French coal trade, is open to the Coastingvessels at remunerative rates.     The necessity for maintaining and increasing coastwisedistribution from the big ports is urgent.  Under peace conditions we were bringing in imports at the rate of  about58,000,000 tons weight per annum, of which about 12,000,000tons came from Central Europe on the smaller types of vessel which could make use of the smaller ports, and  about46,000,000 tons came in on ocean voyages In the largertypes of vessel which could only be handled in the big ports.     Last year (1918) we brought in about 35,000,000 tonsweight of Imports, of which about 33,000,000 tons will have come on ocean voyages in the larger types of vessel  intothe big ports.     The exporting power of Central Europe must remain very limited, and therefore any substantial increase in our imports must be.brought in on ocean voyages into the bigports.     As has been stated the Port Authorities in the  bigports are unanimous that facilities for distribution by  the coasting Services must be improved before they will  be ableto pass through their ports the volume of traffic they dealtwith under peace conditions.
s.323     At the moment the Railways (having been freed froma great deal of Munition traffic and having not yet to dealwith the traffic incident to General Demobilization)  arefreer.  Probably they could handle at the moment,  the Importsat the rate at which they are now arriving, but neither the big ports nor the Railways serving those ports will,  withoutthe help of the Coasting Services, be able to handle  theIncreased volume of traffic we must have to get the Nationback to Industry and Commerce.  .     Unless the Coastal Services are in a position to compete with the Railways there is grave risk that these services, so essential for purposes of distribution around the coasts of the united Kingdom, will no longer be able  to perform their part.     It is essential that a ruling may be given on thismatter at an early date before ohe Coastal Services,  atpresent available, are dissipated.     The courses open would appear to be:- a.  To Issue the Order notwithstanding the Armistice,     and thereby to force cargo on to the Coasting     Services to the relief of the Railways, or b.  To raise the Railway Ratos generally, or in any     event between points that can be served by both  the     Railways and the Coasting Services, so that such     rates may at least cover the actual C03t of Rail     carriage, or o.  Keep the imports within the distributing capacity     of tho Railways, and recognise that distribution     coastwise must be abandoned.id January 1919.
