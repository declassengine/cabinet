Colonel JonesCONFIDENTIAL.5KECENT EEPORTSREGARDING THESITUATION IN GERMANY.(B18/498) 200 1/19 H&amp;S 6676wo
CONFIDENTIAL.0. 18/8370K.Conversation on the 4th  December, 1918, with an American                    recently arrived from  Berlin.                            GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.    Q. How long have you been in  Berlin ? A.  Since 1902, but I have always been identified with American interests.    Q. At  the  time our Embassy left, when we entered the  war, what  did  youdo ? A.  Well, I went almost immediately into the American Chamber  of Commerce.My predecessor died the clay after Ambassador Gerard left.    Q. Since  that time you have been looking  after American interests ? A. since that time I have been looking after American interests.    Q. Mr.  X, will you tell us what in your opinion was the cause of the present state in Germany the present military collapse in Germany ? A. I think that the presentcollapse of Germany was due to the following reasons : Germany had all her successes atthe beginning  of the war, at a time when the people could stand some reverses becausethey had  food.  They had  believed in their army, as they are accustomed to be victorious,and they  believed that these victories were bringing results.  They expected this to comepromptly in  the form of a request for an armistice on the part of one or the other of theirenemies coming first  from France.  Then  came a  period of what you might callwatchful  waiting they still maintained their belief in the  army and the Government.The Government at  that time  instituted very wide  propaganda,  urging the people tohave faith&apos; that final victory would he theirs.    Q. When did the German people first  know that America  was earnestly in thewar ? A. I think about late in 1917.    Q. And they then began  to  get reports of  what they were doing ? A. Yes,&quot;thefigures at that time were published in the English papers regarding the  number  oftroops.   The figures and  statements were never published in the  German papers, thecensor would not allow it.    Q. Did anybody find out about  those  things ? A. Yes,  the  English paperswere bought and sold in  Germany, but the censor would not pass it  They did tell a story  of  the &quot;Vaterland&quot; arriving  in France,  unloading 11,000 troops, taking on14,000 tons of coal and getting out in 48 hours.  This made a big impression on theGerman people.                            MILITARY OBSERVATIONS.    Q. As  far as you have been able to observe and learn  from such sources  thatyou have in Berlin, what is the  present state of military affairs in Germany ? A. Thepresent military  situation in Germany is  about as  follows: Discipline has practicallydisappeared; the only sign of it now in existence is in the voluntary willingness of thesoldiers not  demobilized to obey the  appeal of von Hindenburg, asking them to followhis orders regarding demobilization in order that the homeland may not  be too quicklyflooded with  soldiers,  thus crippling the food situation,  which  would  be  in certain sections  disastrous.  There  appears  to be a certain discipline in that respect.  VonHindenburg is still popular.   The soldiers who are coming home  are wearing&apos; militaryuniform,  because  they have no other clothing.  They have torn off their clothing allsigns of their  units, and some of them have taken the  buttons off their uniform becausethey have &quot; Gott mit uns&quot; and  the Crown on them.  The soldiers  in the home territory and those demobilized are following the orders of the  Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Council.     Q.  Actual demobilization then is going on at present? A. Yes, still  going on.The soldiers  have  not been all  given proper transportation and  I  passed to-daythousands of soldiers marching on through the country.  I understand they are  com-pelled to make about 16 km. a day.     Q.  Are those soldiers you  saw marching  to-day in units ? A.  Yes, apparently in very good formation, with heavy artillery, and carrying their arms and their  packs.    (0070)                                                                A 2
     Q. Whore was that ? A. It was on the further side of Cassel, on the further side of General Headquarters ;  somewhere on the other side of Cassel Hindenburg has formed three cordons to keep any  rushing back to prevent it three lines, all with the aim of preventing the soldiers, at any cost,  flooding into the towns and cities, because it will mean starvation for hundreds if they do.     Q. These troops that  have retreated  from Belgium  and France and the troops that were in Germany, have any great number of them been actually demobilized, and the men gone back to their homes ? A. Yes, the Berlin Guard Corps is arriving now in these  days in sections; the city is - flying the flags and  the railroad stations are decorated with evergreen and  flags, but it  is a  pitiful  sight.   Papers have urged the people to display flags and show feeling for  the return of the troops, but  the  troops are not returning as victors, and there is considerable depression ; it gave me the impression as being more of a funeral, because it is so contrary to what the people expected of the grand march of the victors the Berlin Guard.     Q. These men  who  are coming  back, I will ask  you if they  are  still in  their units or  if they are out  of their units? A. They are still in their units until  they arrive in Berlin.     Q. Do they  disperse  and go  to  their homes ? A.  They  disperse and go to their homes;  they first have to report to an office in  Berlin, where they receive either a  new military uniform  or a civilian  uniform that  they have been collecting  in the last few months,  and  they receive as discharge money 50  marks.  To relieve the situation, the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Council  has  issued an order that firms  who formerly employed these men are obliged to take them back, &quot;whether they need them or not, and put them on the pay roll.  This relieves the labour  situation somewhat, but it  is entirely inadequate.     Q. Have you  any idea as to  how many troops have been  demobilized since the signing of  the Armistice ? A. I do not believe  the  Germans themselves can  give  a correct figure because many of them  have taken no regard of Hinclenburg&apos;s appeal and they simply stormed the trains.   I have seen trains coming into Berlin with soldiers on the top of them long passenger trains.  Hundreds of soldiers have been killed by going through tunnels on their homeward trips.  Other soldiers have  taken possession of box cars, and they have told their officers that they had nothing more  to say to them ;  they have taken possession of these box cars and  filled them  with  stolen  goods, and  these cars were protected against  other soldiers by force and kept in their possession until they arrived in Berlin.  Upon arrival these  goods were sold; one instance that I  refer to  especially a tub of butter was  sold  at a mark a pound, when the price in Berlin for butter to-day is between 28 marks and 32 marks a pound.    Q. Have you seen anything that  would make you  believe that von  Hinderburgis endeavouring to hold an army together to occupy a  line back  of the neutral  zone ?  A. I have seen nothing  and I have heard nothing, but in  view of the silence of the present Government it would seem reasonable to suppose that Hindenburg  would atleast  try to  do this, because  Hindenburg  lias  pledged his support to the  present Government.    Q. You  do not  know  anything  then  about plans for holding an army  in theservice ? A.  Nothing is known by me, no, sir.   I do  not believe it could be done.    Q. They  do  not take enough  interest in  their  country  to  volunteer  even, dothey ? A. No, not to fight against a foreign foe.    Q. All  indications  are  then  that  the present  army  that is  retreating will bedissipated as  rapidly as possible for the individual to get back home ? A.  Yes, sir.    Q. Are  they  bringing  back  any  equipment with them those men  that  you have seen coming back ? A. Yes, all the soldiers that I have seen  coming back into Berlin have their field equipment.    Q. Do they  have  any rifles ? A. They have  rifles the Spartacus Group hastried  to  get possession of these rifles by  sending delegations of soldiers in uniform demanding the turning over of the weapons, that is how  they get their weapons.    Q. They  meet the returning  troops at  the  train ? A. They meet the  returning troops at the train, and also before they reach Berlin.   The papers before I left contained several warnings to the  troops that they should follow only  instructions and  orders which were posted up in public places and on the public billboards.    Q. Are  the soldiers now  regularly occupying the  various  garrison buildings in Germany ? A. All of the garrisons in  Berlin are occupied.   The soldiers are in uniform and the occupation is due to the fact that there and only there  can they have any  hope of getting food.  The field kitchens are still in operation.
      Q. Are tliey doing any regular drilling of any kind ? A.  No, sir.      Q, What became of their  arms? A.  Their arms have been turned over to a  special office  designated  for that purpose, in some cases this office is at  the railroad  station.      Q. Plave you seen any artillery coming back into Berlin ? A.  Not a bit.      Q. Machine guns ? No, sir.      Q. Coming  out  from Berlin through Germany, ha^e  you seen any  artillery ?-  A. Yes, to-day, [ saw marching in tho proper order and  apparently in  full formation  what must have been two or three batteries of artillery.      Q, Where ? On the further side of Cassel, going towards Berlin.      Q. Did you  notice  any movement that would indicate their taking up  a line  beyond the Rhine at some place ? A. No, I watched that very carefully coming down,  I watched very carefully for that, and I saw no indication of preparation of any military  movement, everything was  moving towards  Berlin.  I did see trains side-tracked with  iield wagons  on.  I do not think they were all  full, but they were trains headed for  Berlin coining from the front as the locomotives were all under steam.      Q. To  what  extent  has the Soldiers&apos; and  Workmens Council authority  in  the  German Army now? A. The authority of the Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Council is very  general.  It even goes Lack to the very front as it now exists.   Commanding generals&apos;  have issued orders forbidding the wearing  of the sign of the revolution, the Red Cloth.  Whenever that has become known the Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Council has issued au  ultimatum  to the Government to have this general removed, and in each case  it has  been done almost immediately.  The commanding generals are  powerless to prevent  the formation of  the Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Council in the ranks.  That movement  is general.      Q. Where   do  the  officers, generals&apos; and   subordinate  officers  derive  their  authority, upon what  is their authority based ? A.  Well,  the only generals who have  authority are those generals in command of troops not yet  demobilized,  namely, under  Hindenbiirg&apos;s command.      Q. They depend  on the Soldiers&apos;  and  workmen&apos;s Council  for  their authority,  do they? A. Yes,  their authority  is supreme.   Hindenburg recognizes the authority  of the Soldiers&apos; and  Workmens Council, and he confers with them daily at General  Headquarters.      Q. Where is Hindenburg now ? A. He-is at Cassel.      Q. Do you know or  have  you heard of any force at all outside of those that  are  under this Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Council any military forces I A. Yes,  there  has-  been tried it has been tried to organize the so-called  &quot; Red Guard,&quot;   At  present this  move is very strongly fought against by the Soldiers&apos; and  workmen&apos;s Council.      Q. The Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Council are not Bolshevists ? A.  No.      Q. You do not think they will be ? A. No.      Q. Are they so set against it  that they are not liable  to be turned ? A. They  are not liable to be turned, they will fight to have the National  Assembly take  place.  The  Soldiers&apos;  and  Workmens  Council to-day  represents  all classes of  the German  people.  Only in certain localities is the Soldiers&apos; and Workmens  Council  radical, that  is  in one or two suburbs of Berlin where  the population  of those districts is  almost  exclusively radical,  and in  those districts that I refer  to they  have  set up a local  government which is extremely  radical.   For instance,  the Soldiers&apos;  and Workmen&apos;s  Council of Neukolln,  a suburb of  Berlin, has  proclaimed  all salaries under  5,000  marks a year exempt from taxation.      Q. The Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Council, generally, is the  constituted authority  in Berlin ? A. Yes, sir.      Q. It is moderate in  its politics ? A.  Quite correct.   They are so  strong and  their strength is  recognised by the Imperial Chancellor because the papers contain daily  results of the happenings of the Workmens and Soldiers&apos;  Council concerning certain  propositions that have been communicated  to  the Chancellor ordering him to do certain  things, but up to now these results have been moderate,  but  fully in keeping with the  socialistic democratic idea which  is the moderate and better element  of the socialistic  and democratic parties.      Q. Have you any information as to how many soldiers there  are  at  present  not  demobilized ? A. I cannot give any statement as to that because I do not know, I have  no means of knowing.   It is the policy of  this of the present Government it is their  aim to demobilize the whole army.   It is the  intention of the Soldiers&apos; and Workmens  Council to demobilize every man.
      Q.  Is there any talk whatever of opposing  the  line of the Allies? A.  No, that is  in my  opinion  impossible,  in  fact  it  is openly  stated that  Germany is at  the mercy of the Entente, and  it is  also openly stated that Germany will have  to accept whatever terms of peace are dictated, without resistance.   Men  have told me this with tears in their eyes, older men of the good citizenship  class, who  have lived through  the glory of 1871, not  military men bankers have  told me this :  &quot; We are at the mercy of the Entente,&apos; and  whatever they  dictate Germany must accept and will accept. Germany is broken, absolutely broken.&quot;      Q, In spirit ? A,  In spirit.      Q.  How about in money? A.  Germany&apos;s financial condition is in  such a  state that her best financiers to-day see no way out of the situation.  At the present moment, as long as they  have paper and printing presses, there will  be no shortage  of money.      Q, Is there any evidence at  all that there  will be any  effort  made to  reinstate the Kaiser? A. At the present moment I would say that this is absolutely  impossible. According to the opinion of the German people, his greatest offence toward them was in leaving the country.  They have told me quite openly that millions have  died for him, and even after  he gave up his crown they expected him to say, &quot;I am still a German with the army,&apos;&quot;&apos; and would remain with them and support  the present Government in so  far as he would throw no obstacle in  the way.  He  and his ideas have no place in  the Germany of  to-day.     Q. What  is the status  of  the  old  Standing Army  officers? A.  The  present status of the officers actually  in Germany is a very  serious  one.   Their future as officers in the Imperial Army is gone.  Older officers it will not strike so badly, but  the younger officers  who have gone to  the Academy the  Military  School, who have been trained in  military things only, and have  ignored every other subject, find themselves to-day facing a situation which is going to be almost national in its size. Two days ago the officers of Berlin called  a meeting in one  of the large assembly halls to consider this situation.   They chose  as  their speakers commercial  men who could give  them suggestions as to how they could change their careers.   Schools  have been proposed to train younger officers in typewriting and things of that  nature, mechanics and the like. This movement has been already put into  motion.   The older officers of to-dajr are  not seen in their uniforms in Berlin.   The attitude of the soldier in the streets towards a high officer in uniform is highly unfortunate.   The officer AVIIO dares to wear his uniform around will not go very far  before some sailor or  soldier will tap him on  the  shoulder and tell him to take it off.   Officers  sitting in street  cars in uniform have been told to get up and let the soldiers sit down.   The officers have never made any resistance since the revolution.   In  the days of the revolution some  have made resistance by pulling their swords.  Some officers, who remained true to  the  King,  fortified themselves in hotels and shot at the people in the streets whether they shot to kill, I doubt.  In  the cellars of the War Library a body of them fortified themselves and fought against  the soldiers.  They were finally taken prisoners; some of  them escaped.  The  biggest fight occurred at the Mostok, where the  boy scouts and  younger  officers who had pledged themselves to remain true to the  King held forth.   They defended the  Mostok from Saturday night until Sunday morning when it was finally cleaned out.     Q. Are there a great  number of officers  still true to the Kaiser ? A. Probably, but not openly.     Q. Is  there  any  chance  of  their  organizing ? A.  I  believe that  a   certain number of the higher officers, especially those who were close  to the Emperor, do have some hope of collecting an army of soldiers true  to the King, younger officers andjunkers, and  of  some day making an effort to put the  Emperor back, but I have only heard  this  mentioned casually,  and, if it exists at all, it must consist of a very small body, and, in my estimation, they have no hope  of success.   I  believe if the Emperor should try to come back to-day there would be a  general uprising all over the  country.     Q. In  your  opinion  the   revolution  of  the   masses is  complete? A. &quot;It  is complete.  If such  a thing is  possible, to  establish  a  line of resistance against the Entente, it would have no success for this reason : Germany&apos;s economic condition would not support it.     Q. With respect to  the loyalty to the  Kaiser, what division would  you make of the officers ? A.  With respect to the loyalty of the officers  to the Kaiser, I should make two classih&apos;cations; the older officers, necessarily meaning the higher officers  in rank and who are too old to begin a career in any other  line, naturally believe and hope in a revolution which would re-establish the Emperor  and thereby turn them back into their status as officers ;  the younger  officers include all classes.  They realize fully that the Emperor has gone for ever in Germany and the  sooner  they  get  started on a new
 career in some commercial line  the  better,   Therefore, they are supporting, as is manifest, the Soldiers&apos; and  Workmens Council.   Is that clear?     Q. Yes.  Do the German people feel  that their army has  been  beaten  or  that it is an unbeaten army ? A. No, the German people claim  to-day that they have  not been beaten on the battlefield.  The people have told me themselves that the army had not  been beaten in their  eyes.   They ascribed the  downfall  at  the  front to be  the inability of the country to support the army.     Q. With  regard to the general supply  condition, exclusive of the  matter of food, was the supply of munitions so reduced that it would have prevented the German Army from  continuing to function? A.  I. believe the German Army would be fighting to-day if Germany had had food food, food, food.     Q. Was there any shortage  of ammunition 1--A. I would say that if the  food situation had been maintained, Germany would  have  never I  say never capitulated, she could have fought for an indefinite period,     Q. In other words, you mean that there was no shortage of munitions? A.  No sir, some of  the factories had stopped working, they had taken off their night crew.     Q. Do  you  know  whether  or not there  was  an  universal belief among  the German  authorities, including the General Staff, that it was impossible for us  to produce over here the military forces  that  we  did were they surprised or  were  they not ?  A.  The people were surprised ;  I do not  believe  the  General Staff ever doubted for a moment  but the United States could put across in large numbers all the  troops  she could mobilize at home.   They reckoned on some dissension  between England,  France and  America to stop that.  The people believed-what  they were  told,  namely, that America could raise an army they said  America could collect together eleven  million men, but that it would be a mob, and that even  if she raised an army and  trained it, she could not ship it across because the U-boats would sink every ship that left America  would not let  a single boat land.     Q. How much of the truth did the  German population as a  mass receive as to battles on the Western Front&apos;! A. I believe the reports given out by the General Staff were true as far as they went.   We had copies of the English and  American reports on the same totals and they figured almost  correctly.  The discrepancy was  in what was omitted.   They did not tell all the truth but  what they did tell was the truth.     Q. You had some experience in tabulation, did you  not ?-A. 1 certainly did during the first two years of the war.     Q. With reference  to  our battles,  especially in the  Argonne, did you get the impression that the Germans regarded it as a successful drive on our part and.  that it was very dangerous for them ? A. They made light of it, but the Headquarters knew the truth but they did not tell the people. In fact,  the truth is  being unearthed so fast in Germany now in these very days that it is hard  to know how much truth was withheld. Certainly the German people were not told half the truth not half the truth,  and  investigation now being made by  the new  Government  shows criminal neglect of the old regime in many instances in  not informing the people  of the true condition.     Q. Do  you  know approximately  the correct number  of the. German  casualties in this war ? A. Yes, the number of dead, I remember plainly, the number of dead was  1,580,000.     Q. That is  official ? A.  That is official; the casualties I cannot recall.     Q.  Do you know  how  many  men Germany has  put under  arms,  from the first to the last? A. Yes ; in answer to this  question, I want to quote General Kuhn, who before leaving Germany  reported  that Germany had all told under military  control between  13 millions and 14i millions, that means men under military orders.     Q. Was there  ever  any  discussion or  anything that came to  your  attention indicating that there was a  shortage of man-power ? A.  No.   Germany  did  have a shortage  of a certain class of men namely, first-line men.     Q. You mean by  that  shock troops ? A. Yes,  sir,   men  who  could compete with the young,  strong men of the United States,  England and France.   About the time America came into the  war, Germany&apos;s leading troops had been wiped off.  Inferior men were taking the places  at the front  and  they were men who  could  not compete with the  well-fed young athletic men of America.   German soldiers who have been on leave have told  me  that.   Many of them have said they regretted very  much  tellingme as a foreigner that we have to praise the American soldier, he said we cannot stand up against them, they are younger  men than  we are ?     Q. What  distinction was  made by the  Germans  in  the  treatment of  allied prisoners ? A.  There have been so many reports about maltreating the  prisoners in
Germany  that it  is very difficult to get a concise statement.   I do believe that therewere cases of illtreatment.   The investigations of the neutral powers  have shown that,These may be limited to certain camps where the camp officers  have  been of a verydisagreeable  type  of men.    I  believe there has been a  discrimination  made  in thetreatment of prisoners    I believe they have been very strict with the French becausethe French have had very many coloured troops.   The  first experience of the Germanswith coloured troops came from France, and the Germans called them black Frenchmen,and at  that  time  the  country was very much wrought up about bringing in african troops to fight on European soil.   These prisoners were kept under very close  watch,and they were not  given  the liberties  that the Canadians or the English were, and certainly not the liberties that we had.       J    Q.  You  think they  treated the American prisoners the best? A.  I should say the American prisoners have been treated the best for two reasons: the Americanscame  into the war late,  and at that  time the camps  were in much better condition,better organized and managed ;  and the fighting spirit of the German people had been greatly  broken, and they did not have the animosity against the foe that they had whenthey entered the war.  They were more accustomed to having the enemy in the countryin the form of prisoners.    Q.  What is your  estimate  of the German  soldier as a fighting  man as compared to other soldiers that  you  know ? A.  That is a very  good question.   When the war broke out I  had a very high opinion of the individual  German  soldier, because I had never seen him put to the test.  I believe to-day the German soldier is inferior to theFrench, the English, the Canadian, the Australian and  the  American.   For this very.reason the German people eat too much.  They have eaten too much for the lasthundreds of years.   That is one reason.   He has not the initiative  of-any one of thesesoldiers  whom I have mentioned.  His training: has tended  to make him a machine, andhis training has also  robbed him  of his self respect.  The almost brutal handling of theyoung recruit by the non-commissioned officer  from his first day  on  makes a  man a machine.    Q.  Do you  consider the Prussians  as particularly different from the others? A. Yes, sir, the German army certainly shows its difference in soldiers  in  so far  as thedifferent nationalities are concerned.  They all have their characteristics.    Q.  How much truth is there in  the stories  of the  assault by German  soldierson French and Belgian  women, in regard to their carrying off French and  Belgian girlsinto Germany for more or less immoral purposes ? A.  It would be very difficult for meto verify  those statements.   I  have heard of these tilings, but they have not beenspoken  about in the papers.   The German  Government   has always repulsed such reports  as being untrue, but with 15 million  men under arms it is undoubtedly true.It seems that such things have happened.  As a  race, their idea of  a moral standard isbelow ours.   There have been many organizations and institutions started in recent years to improve the morals of the  people all kinds of organizations. The morals of the country&apos;have suffered terribly during the war.   We find that the men at the front in thousandsand thousands of cases have behaved shamefully.  We find that the women, while themen were at the front, in thousands and thousands of cases have behaved shamefully.    Q.  Been  untrue ? A.  Yes, sir,  shamefully, not  only shamefully, but  openlyshamefully.   There will be thousands and thousands of  divorce cases after the war, dueto the fact  of the improper conduct of the wife during the husband&apos;s absence at thefront.   The  husband has been  informed by friends and he has returned and murderedhis wife.  That has happened time and time again.  As a  whole the  German womenhave it is awfully hard to  put  that thing into words they have gone into all kinds ofwork,    They have  worked on the railroad, they have been running the  street cars, theyhave ripped up rails in  the  streets  and. laid down  new rails, always supervised by asuperior, but there has  been no work too hard or too low for the women to do.  she has also gone  into  the  higher branches of work; she  has gone into the  banks and managed in some cases  the factories in the absence of her husband and she has  showngood business ability, but the morals of the women have suffered  terribly I mean theeffect  of the war upon the women, especially upon the wives of those who have been  atthe front, is disgraceful.                               ECONOMIC SITUATION.    Q.  Where has Germany procured all the material she used  to manufacture hermunitions of war, &amp;c, with special reference  to  metal  ?-A. Of course,  there  alwayswas a shortage of certain kinds of metals, especially  copper.   Even early in the war,German  U-boats had the  instructions in taking ships to  bring home all  the  copper
 they could.   As you know, Belgium was  stripped of very  much of her metals,  and Gemany proper was stripped of her metal reserves door knobs, rings, brass hinges  of doors, brass screws.  This system was conducted by the cities, which established metal collection stations that sent out printed forms for people to report the amount of metal in their possession, whether  it was knick-knacks, screws, &amp;c, for  the  last  2^- years. But  I  doift  mean  that Germany  needed  these  metals  immediately it  meant the proper  authorities had figured out that at  a certain date,  possibly  a year or two  hence,  she would  need  so many tons  of brass; that is  quite  typical  of all German  preparation, especially in the Quartermasters Department.  As regards their material necessary in the manufacture of  munitions,  German chemists have  played  a great r61e ; namely, in  finding substitutes for almost anything they need.     Q.  What is the  present  food situation in Germany? A.  On the day  I  left Berlin (3rd December)  the German evening papers announced that I had been called to the Headquarters  at  Spa in response to  a telegram from  the Commanding General. A telephone rang at my house from the Chief of the Imperial Grain Office,  asking me to come down for an interview.   I spent two hours with the Chief who  dictated to his stenographer a complete statement of the  present food situation, with special reference to the grain  situation, which means Gcrmany&apos;s daily bread.  (This statement will be forwarded as soon as  it  arrives  from Berlin.)  Supplementary to  this statement it should be stated that the principal  food article of the German  people to-day is bread.     Q.  How about potatoes ? A. Yes, and potatoes.  The  German workman receives in the morning, one thick slice of bread, brown, dry,  unpalatable bread, without butter or marmalade, and black coffee, which  is  ground  corn, without  sugar  or milk.   For dinner, he receives potatoes, and one or two vegetables which vary daily.   For evening, he finishes his bread  ration, which he has very carefully proportioned for the day,  and any little bit that  his wife can warm up  for him, the rest of the dinner or if  he has been  fortunate  enough in getting a rabbit or some stray piece of meat the origin of which nobody knows.   The bread  card is the workman&apos;s  cheque on the baker.  So long as lie can cash that cheque  and secure his bread,  the present situation will continue in Germany without  disastrous results to  the temporary government.  The Chief of the Grain Office told me that the supply of grain on hand now was never so low  at any time during the war as at present.  The present amount of grain now at the disposal of the Grain Office for  distribution to the  950  mills working continually for  the Grain Office is approximately 35,000 tons at present.     Q. Just what is   this Grain  Office ?  Is it a  private  institution  or  public ?  A. The Head Grain Office of the Empire is a government institution,.and was established early in the war for the purpose of buying  and  distributing grain to the mills operating under the jurisdiction  of the  Grain  Office.  The sub-divisions of the Grain Office are established all over the  country,  at the head of which is a district manager who buys and controls  all grain within his district.  To increase the  grain production, the Grain Office offered a premium of 20 marks per ton three years ago, which resulted in an immediatejump  in the -results.   The next year a premium of  50  marks was offered, but without the success  of the preceding  year.  The  last  year  100 marks premium per ton was. offered with still less result,    Q.  What is the nature of this premium ? A.  The nature of  this  premium is in cash paid to  the farmer who produces the grain, i.e., the premium is in excess of  the price  normally paid.   It  is not possible at the present time to state what will happen at the  end of two months, as Poland lias refused to deliver any grain to Germany, and next year the prospects are even worse, for the reason that the necessary fertilizer willnot be available.    Q.  As far as you  found out  from the authorities  in Berlin, what  is the presentsupply of food on  hand in the  different articles ? A.  When I tried to find out, in aconference with State  Secretary Fame,  of the Imperial  Food Office, he told me thatto-day there  are  20,000,000  people in  Germany who  are  in immediate danger ofstarvation.  These people are centred principally  in the  largest cities. It is  estimatedthat the  well-to-do classes have  hoarded  supplies.   The present amouut of butterreceived per head per week is 20  grammes (if oz.),  the amount of meat per head perweek I lb.,  including bone; bread 2,300  grammes (5 lbs.) per head per week  (morethan in  France).  This ration will be reduced in the next 2 or 3 weeks.    Q.  What about potatoes? A. The potato ration is 7 lbs. per week per head, 1 lb.a day.   The following articles  can be procured only on  the  card system  : sugar, milk,butter, marmalade, eggs, coffee substitute, bread, petroleum and margarine.  The citiesissue cards without any designation which provides for the distribution  of any article which the city may  happen to secure.   The public knows of this by the newspapers and    (6676)                                                                    B
public announcements.  Each city makes an effort to buy  supplies for its inhabitants.Of the above affected articles, eggs, milk and sugar are distributed very rarely.     Q. Where they don&apos;t always get  their ration allowance provided by their tickets,do they get substitutes for  these articles? A.  They have a certain ration allowance,and if they don&apos;t have one kind they get a substitute for it.  It often  happens  thatsugar  will be announced  to be distributed.   The people  flock with  their cards andprobably only the first 16 in line will get the sugar, the rest will have to go home.     Q. What  effect  has  the  food  situation  had  on  mortality  in  Germany,  moreespecially  among new-born  children ? A.  Yery  great.    The number  of deaths perweek was so high  a  month ago  that  statistics were not  published.  The number  ofdeaths per week due to the grippe, which ravaged the country for a long  period, was  inBerlin over 1,000 per week, due principally to  the under-nourishment  of the ill their inability to fight the disease and recuperate.  People who were taken to hospitals and private clinics fared better, because the authorities have  favoured  these institutions  inthe  matter  of food  supplies.   The   medical profession at present  in Germany  isoverworked.   Many of the doctors themselves have  been physically unable to perform the worlc.   The mortality of the children is especially great.     Q. What kind of food supplies are mostly necessary  from  America at the  presenttime? A. State Secretary Wurm told me that  Germany&apos;s immediate requirements  in food supplies consist  of fat and grain.  His estimate  of Germany&apos;s monthly  foodrequirements would cost Germany to-day at the present rate  of exchange  six billionmarks per month.   This included sufficient food  to prevent Germany from a threateningstarvation.     Q. What  are  the prospects  for next  year&apos;s crops? A.  The  prospects  are veryunfavourable, due to the following reasons: first, the land has been tilled  and managed by the labour of prisoners who have taken very little interest in their work.  Secondly,the  amount  of fertilizer  was  not  sufficient for last years  crop, and for next yearspractically1 none  is available.  It  is therefore clear that before Germany can secure a normal crop, 5  or 7 years will pass.     Q. To  what  extent  can  America  control  disorders  in  Germany  through  food supply from America ? A. By dictating the terms to Germany by which Germany can secure these supplies, and  the state of  the German mind to-day is  in such  a  condition that it will  follow very  closely  Americas  dictation, because they believe to-day  that america is  acting  in good faith.   As mentioned above, the cities have considered its population as a family and have provided for them accordingly ; in  the  same  mannerhave large firms considered their employees, namely, by buying supplies wherever theycould find them, whether they cost more than the maximum price or less, buying them at any cost, and distributing them to the workmen at a price within their reach, paying the difference themselves.   This has tended to keep the working classes  in subjection.The firms are now no longer able to secure food at any price anywhere.     Q. Now, supposing the present blockade of  Germany to continue indefinitely,  how many weeks do you think will elapse before absolute famine would exist?&apos; A-.  If Germanyreceives  no  help  from the  outside world, from which she is now entirely cut off,starvation will set in,  first in the large centres,  spreading  to  the  provincial  districts,within the next 3 or 4 months.     Q. How soon can the great industrial establishments  of Germany resume operationsif they receive raw materials? A. The factories whose machinery was not adjusted  tothe manufacture  of munitions  can begin operations  immediately upon receipt  of  rawmaterial, principally the cotton mills in the great cotton district of which  ;-:  is thecentre, and the machine factories which before the war did a great exportation business in machines of all kinds.     Q. Considering the present and future financial  obligations of Germany, what doyou  think of the outlook ? A.  Inasmuch as the national wealth of Germany is estimatedat 360 billion marks, of which  more  than half has been  consumed by war debts, andthe impending indemnities imposed by the Peace Conference, Germany&apos;s financial situationis almost hopeless, and  her financiers  to-day cannot prophesy as to what  the outcomewill  be.  The Germans expect to pay a good-sized indemnity.   The  Germans will notbe surprised, and  even expect, that a  comparatively heavy indemnity will be  imposedupon them by the Allies, and that their sources of income, mines, &amp;c, wili be  attached in view of their inability to pay. ,     Q. What  are  the conditions  of Germany&apos;s  railroads 1-A.  The  condition  ofGerm any &apos;s railroads to-day is hopeless, in so far as they have a tremendous amount  of repair  work on hand and no material v ith which to do it,  and the present great  need of rolling stock.  That  is why the German Commission made an immediate  protestconcerning the number of locomotives and wagons or cars demanded by the Entente.
     Q. Is the condition of the permanent way good or bad? A. Bad.   The women of the country have been relied upon entirely during the past two years to keep it up.     Q. Do you  know if the lorries  returning from the  front are being seized by the civil population and being used for  farm purposes ? A. They are not worth it.  There is not a car that comes back from the front that would be useful to anybody.     Q. Have they got a reserve supply of coal? A,  Germany&apos;s  rolling stock  at present is in such demand for the  transportation  of food supplies and bringing back soldiers from the front,  that the  delivery of thousands of locomotives and  wagons demanded by the Entente threatens a catastrophe concerning rolling stock.  I do not think  the protest is entirely justified.   1  believe &quot;that the commission  that made the protest did that under pressure  of  the people at  home who found  the conditions unreasonable, and they had  to satisfy them  to  make some complaint and they hit on that as the most  feasible case., Some  of the conditions  imposed upon Germany were imposed by Germany  on  Russia  and  Rumania.  They are  getting some of their own medicine.     Q. What is the state of their present commercial supplies stocks in the stores, &amp;c. ? A.  Exhausted.     Q. Draught animals  the same ? A. Yes.  In fact, to day, Germany is stripped  to her back,  you may  say.     Q. When you  go  into Wertheirns (a large department store) what do  you  find ?  A. You  will find  Wertheim&apos;s warehouse filled up  with substitute  goods with the exception of certain dressmaking goods, which have been so cautiously rationed that a small supply still exists.  The Germans have been very inventive in finding  a substitute for nearly everything, and for many goods even four or five substitutes have been found, each substitute becoming inferior and more worthless in quality.     Q. Clothes for example ? A.  The present supply of civilian cloth is not so serious as one may expect,  due to the fact that people are wearing  out their supply on hand, and, too, measures have been adopted  by the Government months ago by  compelling the  richer  classes  to  deliver up  one or two suits,  which have  been distributed  on payment to the lower working classes.     Q. Do they use paper substitutes to any extent ? A. Yes.  Paper underclothes have been manufactured and worn, but they will not stand washing and the manufacture has practically ceased.   The shoe situation is the most serious, as leather has practically disappeared and  shoes  with wooden and canvas tops have been thrown on the market.     Q. What do leather shoes cost ? A. A pair of leather  shoes, if obtainable  at all, costs anywhere&apos;from 75 to 125 marks.   The substitute shoe of leather and canvas costs about  18 to 22 marks,  and can only be obtained  on  the card system.   In the summerpeople have  gone barefoot, even  in the streets, to their  work.  Stockings and socks are still obtainable,  but very poor in quality,  and cost, for men, 6 to 10 marks a pair, and for women 16 to 25.     Q. What is the status of the American  business firms left in  Berlin ? A.  As  an act of retaliation American firms were placed  under control by the Ministry  of Trade,for which the firms  were obliged to pay to their respective  controllers anywhere from 100 marks a month to  1,000 marks, depending on the amount of capital on hand.     Q. But they continue to do  business&apos;? A.  Yes, firms who have stocks on handhave been allowed to sell and also to buy stock in  their lines of business  in order  to enable them to carry on the business.                              POLITICAL SITUATION.     Q. Will you sketch  out briefly  the present political situation  in Germany ? A. The present German Government is a self-appointed one, and hopes  to maintain  its authority until confirmed by the National Assembly, which is arranged  to take place  atthe latest  16th February.   Efforts are, however,  being made to have this take place  atan earlier date.   The present government recognizes fully  that it is impossible  for theEntente to consider a conclusion of peace until the National Assembly has taken place. The men now in authority represent the better, moderate and sane element of the GermanSocialist Democratic Party.  Their leaders have been wise in maintaining the subordinateofficials at their posts, realizing thereby that the  rather perfect machinery will continueto maintain  order.   The  political situation is so  closely allied to the  food and labour questions&quot;  that it is difficult  at present to say how  long their power will last.  Thegreatest danger to the  present Government now is the extreme Left party, known as theSpartacus  Group, championed by Karl Liebknecht and  Bosa Luxemburg, both repre-senting the Radical Russian idea  of democracy.   It is a fact that the  latter party isgaining in strength  among the lower unthinking  classes.    (6076)                                       .                            0
     Q. What is that gain due to 1 A,  This gain in strength is due to the inability of the  returning soldier  to  find employment, properly to feed himself, to his hardship during the past 4 years,  and the deplorable economic situation of his family, which has  riven many men to desperation.  The cry of the Spartacus Group appeals to just such men.  It is also known that this group  is collecting weapons, and has even circulated handbills openly calling upon soldiers  not  to deliver their weapons and arms, and to secure the revolution  and the ideals  thereby gained by putting up a fight against the calling of a National Assembly.     Q. What do they have against a  National Assembly ? A,  Because their claim is that  all parties will  be  represented,  and  thereby  many would  lose what they have gained by the revolution.     Q. In other words, they are in the minority and do not believe in majority rule ?- A.  That is it.   Their great cry is the  dictatorship of the. proletariat, and the)&apos; demand the government in  which  all other  parties shall be excluded.   At the present time, this party is greatly in the minority, and although  they will make  a desperate effort, they will lose when  it  comes to the issue.     Q. It is your opinion, then, that they  will be able to carry  their elections  and  to form an Assembly ? A.  Yes.  When  the national election is announced, that  will  be the sign  for the  Spartacus Group to carry out their plan, whatever it is, and it  will  be a plan, too.   It  is my  personal opinion that they will prevent people from  entering in the electoral offices.     Q.  Do you  think they will make armed resistance ? A.  Yes ; there is a possibility of a civil war.   The  most  potent way to combat this is to supply food and thereby rob the party to  secure more followers.   It  has been  expressed  by  many open-minded Germans that it would be far better for the Entente  troops to  take  possession  of the country until order is established.     Q.  In case they form the Assembly, what form of government is it expected  they will adopt ? A. Undoubtedly a Republic, embracing all of the German States.     Q.  Will German-speaking Austria be included in that ? A. That is a point which is not at present clear.  The Soldiers&apos; and Workmens Councils  throughout the country generally support this idea, namely, a Republic.     Q.  What will be the line of activity of the German people  in  case they  restore their prosperity  ? A.  It is thoroughly believed, in view of the  characteristic  psycho- logical aspects of the German manner of thinking, that the old military spirit will againassert itself in the same proportion that Germany becomes prosperous.  This statement is made in spite  of all assertions made  by the German  people to-day to the contrary. The military spirit has been so deeply  rooted that they cannot  throw it  off overnight. They think they are doing it and are sincere at the present moment.
Report by Brigadier-General H. 0. Rees, D.S.O., on the Condition   of Affairs  in  Germany between the 12 th and 15th December.                              GENERAL IMPRESSIONS.     i.  Germany appears to be completely beaten and disorganized ; further hostilitieson  any appreciable scale are most improbable.   The German people are, in  my opinion,fully aware of this fact and accept it as a lesser evil than the continuance of the war.     2.  The nation as a whole  is on the verge of starvation.  The scarcity of food ismuch more  pronounced  in  tbe large towns  than in  the country districts,  but  thereduction of the food ration has been so gradually carried  out that  the masses  arehardly aware of the extent of the reduction.     Good food is still obtainable in big hotels at very high prices.     The use of substitutes for necessary articles of food has been brought  to  a  highpitch of perfection.     -3.  Owing to the lack of raw materials industry is nearly at a standstill, and  thethousands of men now disbanded will not be able to find work.     4.  The high standard of discipline obtaining under the old  regime still holds  thenation.   The workmen&apos;s  and  Soldiers&apos; Councils carry very little  weight,  and  arefeared by the average citizen as likely to  introduce Bolshevism owing to their incapacityas rulers.  For this reason many in Berlin would be glad to see the capital occupied  by allied troops, preferably American, after that English,  but not French.                                   NARRATIVE.     I was a prisoner of war at Bad-Colberg, Saxe-Meiningen, and, at the request of the senior British officer at the camp, I proceeded to Berlin on  the  12th December to endeavour to obtain some information regarding the evacuation of the camp, and  also to obtain food supplies from the Ked Cross, as we were running  very short.     At  this camp  the local people, our camp guard, &amp;c,  were fully convinced that Germany had lost the  war.   In spite of this, every village and town in Germany  had been decorated to welcome back the troops.   In no sense  was this intended to be other than an ordinary welcome.   It was not the welcome given to a victorious army.     On leaving Bad-Colberg we took a guard of one Feldwebel  with us to Berlin,   We took train at Coburg and went to Lichtenfels, where we secured seats in the first express which had been  run since  the Armistice from Munich to Berlin, reaching  Berlin the same night.     The  only food  available  in the restaurant at Lichtenfels  was a little  soup,  two potatoes and a small quantity of macaroni, which was obtainable at 12 noon.  Nothing whatever  could be bought at other towns.     During the journey we saw crowds of soldiers, but all disbanded, no formed bodies. I saw many men  in  a state of considerable exhaustion and dirt.   From Lichtenfels to Halle (Munich Berlin mainline)  we did not pass a single train of any.description.   On our arrival at Berlin the station was crammed, chiefly with soldiers,  but we were  not molested  in any  way while making our way through  the crowd.  The only point of interest that arose was that our Feldwebel, who was wearing a sword, was ordered by a representative of the Worknaens and Soldiers&apos; Council to take it off.     We  stayed in Berlin at the Esplanade Hotel.   The hotel was well kept up, a good band played every evening and sufficient food was obtainable, provided that food  cards were  produced, but at a very great cost.  The food obtainable was such as pate defoie gras, salmon and turkey.    There are three meat days a week ; on these days  a  small quantity of other meat is available.     We were given to understand, both, before leaving our camp and also at Lichtenfels,that street fighting was a daily occurrence  in Berlin,   I spoke  on this  subject to aMr.  Enderis, a press correspondent of the Associated  Press, who was staying at  the
 Adlon Hotel.  He told  me that any street fighting had been enormously exaggerated, and that there was not more than enough that could be put on to provide a  show at the Crystal  Palace.  During  our stay in Germany we saw no signs whatever of any rioting.  Guards under the orders of the  Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council lounged up and down  the streets with rifles over their arms.  They were very well turned out in new uniforms and  wore a red brassard.   These guards on the morning; of the 14th  were engaged in clearing the  (Inter den Linden prior to the march in of tire 3rd Guard Division.     I wished to  go  to  the Adlon Hotel,  and when Lieutenant Campbell explained to the nearest  two members of the Guard that a British General wished to pass  through, they allowed us  through the line although  they stopped everyone else.     The reception accorded to the  troops marching in was not such as would  be given to  a  victorious army.  There was no cheering, there was only a certain amount of hat and handkerchief waving,   I saw portions of some three battalions during the course of the morning.  I estimated the companies at from 90 to 100 strong, chiefly consisting of very  young  soldiers.   Tho  machine  gun limbers behind the companies were drawn by the most disreputable horses that I have ever seen.   In several cases the machine  guns were rusty probably caused by  exposure to  the weather on the train.  The troops, horses, guns, &amp;c, were garlanded  with flowers and leaves, but  the  general impression  left  on one&apos;s mind was that it was a very pitiful &quot;display. &apos;  To each of these companies were one or two officers without swords.     I was given to understand that the officers were turned  away from their commands on  arrival at their barracks, where the command was taken over by the Workraens and Soldiers&apos; Council delegates.  There were not many officers in uniform about the streets; most of them had probably got into mufti.  Those that Lieutenant Campbell talked to appeared to be resigned and  depressed, and  I also  heard that no less  than :i0,000 applications had been received by the Deutsche Bank  from officers wishing .to be employed in the bank at a salary of 130 marks a month.     I heard that the Palaces, both in Berlin  and Potsdam, had been looted, and  that the Kaiser&apos;s  suits had been sold  to the  mob at 30 marks a piece.  The horses and carriages were also sold in the same manner, one carriage and pair  I heard of being sold for  350 marks.   1  heard further that  the clothes, underwear,  boots, &amp;c, at the  depots, stored there for issue to the troops  on demobilization, had been  sold, the  result being that the soldiers returning from the front could not be issued with fresh  clothes.   An English race-horse trainer whom I  met said that good horses could be picked up easily for  150 marks, but that it was  almost impossible to keep them owing to  the  difficulty of obtaining forage.  He quoted some enormous prices for corn.     On the  loth  December, Lieutenant Campbell and  I  left for The Plague, having obtained passes from the workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council, through the courtesy of the Netherlands Minister.  The trains were very crowded, and our train was three-quarters of an hour late in starting.   On the train the chief topic of conversation was the doings of  the Soldatenrat, and  the supply of food from  America.   At Lohne, which is a considerable junction for The Hague Berlin and Cologne--Berlin  lines, we picked  up a man dressed as a civilian;  he turned out to  be a  Captain von  Schroeder, who had served for three years in  the German Plying Corps.   He appeared to have served  withthe German army somewhat by accident, as he was caught in Germany on  the outbreakof war.   Pie had lived 32  years in America and is  married  to an American.  Duringthe last year of the war he was employed in some capacity at the  German Legation atThe Hague.   His  business was Manager of the Hamburg-Amerika  Line.   He  wasexceedingly frank in his remarks regarding the war.  The gist of his remarks amountedto this:      &quot; Germany is  completely beaten ; she is on the point of starvation and her resources in raw material are practically exhausted ;  what are the Entente going to do ?   If they wish Germany to pay for the war,they, must provide her with food and with raw material so that her workmen can set about making money in order to accede  to the demands of the Entente.&quot;  To put it into his own words, he said :  &quot;If  you want to get milk  from the cow. it is no use killing the damned brute.&quot;  Pie was also of the opinion that any body of men in Germany who had the courage of their convictions could upset the present Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council, and he very  strongly recommended that the wisest- course of action to be taken by the. Entente would  be  to instruct Germany that  they would not deal with the Workmens  and Soldiers&apos; Council, but would only deal  with the Keicbstag.   He went on to say- that the masses in Germany had  no  knowledge of western democratic methods, that they had always been accustomed to being ruled and told exactly what they, were to  do, and that under these  conditions  they  were  easy
people to  handle.  Should, on the other hand, the supply  of  food be withheld fromGermany,  starvation  Would bring about anarchy, and the  condition  of affairs would soon be like that of Eussia.   STATEMENT  BY LIEUTENANT A.  CAMPBELL,  WHO  ACCOMPANIED GENERAL REES.    Between  the 12th  and 16th December  I talked with very many Germans of allclasses.   The  universal  attitude seems to be  a  state of thankfulness  that the war  is over.   They fully acknowledge that they are beaten, and now they are waiting  for our terms.  They seem  to he waiting  patiently enough, but it is obvious that they wish toknow how\r they stand.   They are very hungry ; that is, all except the super-rich, who can afford to spend  100 marks or more per diem oh food.  The  one question  in Berlinis :  &quot;  When are the American or English troops  coming, and will  they  give  us  food? &quot;They  want our troops as a protection against the Bolsheviks, and they fear that foodwill not be given to them until all danger of a Bolshevik movement is  past.  they know  that the Bolsheviks may get the upper hand any day owing  to the growinghunger, so it all comes round again to the point: &quot; When will the Allies come, and willthey give us food ?&quot;    There  is no  doubt about the  demobilization.  It is  taking  place  more  or  lessregularly, and from conversations I have had  with  soldiers, their only wishes are home, bread and work.    The officers  are depressed and seem more or less  resigned.  The only  topic of conversation,  apart from  food and the Allies,  is  the  tioldatenrat  and  its  deeds.Sometimes a jest  is made about the more than usually gauche deeds of the Soldatenrat,but there is a genuine fear of what may come.    The presence of British officers is accepted as  a natural  event, and we  wereinvariably received with the same courtesy as  one met with in Germany before the war.It is worthy of notice that  the soldiers treated us as officers and ignored their own.    The life of the  country seems to be going on more or less as in the  former years ofwar, only there is a marked decrease in  traffic  as compared with September, when 1 lasttravelled through Germany. Things are slowly and surely coming to a standstill.    At Coburg Station there were several dozens of locomotives collected.  On enquiryI was told they were for the Allies.  At various  points on the line  groups of locomotiveswere to be seen.  The  German will talk about the  locomotive question without  anybitterness as of the inevitable, and I do not think this attitude was assumed.  I heard in the train many conversations  in which  the Allies were constantly mentioned, andnever  once was any tinge of &quot;hate&quot; expressed.   The Kaiser, the  Imperial family and various members  of the Royal  Houses were spoken of, and always in an ordinary way never a word of disrespect, rather as one speaks of a thing of  the past.   There was never  a  word  mentioned of a possible restoration.  I heard the possibility mentioned ofH.R.H.  the  Duke of Cumberland being restored to the  throne of Hanover, but  thatwas only en passant.                                            report AS TO CONDITIONS IN  GERMANY  BY LIEUTENANT  G. II. BEYEUS,  3RD DUKE                          OF  WELLINGTON^  REGIMENT.            FROM THE  10TH NOVEMBER TO THE 10TH DECEMBER,  1918.     1. On the 10th November, the revolution reached Beeskow i.d. Mark, some 50 miles south-east of Berlin.   Its immediate  effect  was  the  formation of a Soldiers&apos;  Council(Soldatenrat) by the  garrison, the hoisting  of the red flag over the local &quot;barracks andthe ejection of unpopular officers, including the Commandant of the Officers&apos; Prisonersof War Camp there, in which I was then interned, the second officer being appointed inhis place.   On the next day, the Armistice  was signed, and from that time onwards weenjoyed virtual liberty,  leaving the  camp  whenever we  liked and returning when weliked.  In the course of  the next 25 days  I  saw a  lot of the  surrounding  country,extending my walks  as far as  Frankfurt a. Oder and  having many opportunities of conversation both with civilians and soldiers.   On the 5th December, Captain Robinson,V.C., R.F.C., and J, with the unofficial permission of the new Commandant, proceeded
by train to Berlin, dressed in civilian clothes, in order to visit the British Commissionersdealing with the repatriation of prisoners of war.   At Berlin we stopped  at the HotelAdlon, where we registered  as British  officers.   Although  we  bad  no papers,  noobjection whatever was  taken to our stopping there, and  the usual meat, potato andbread  cards  were issued to us as visitors at the hotel.  We remained there  until the10th  December, when we  proceeded by train to Warnemunde, where we rejoined therest of the  camp.     2. As  a result  of my  observations during that period I feel convinced that the.revolution  is  a real and genuine movement, and that there is no serious danger of anyattempt on the part of the German people to resume hostilities.    So far as i can judge the country is thoroughly exhausted ; the people regard the war as at an end and have accepted  defeat as final.  Their anxieties circle round the three  questions of food, order and peace.     3. Dealing with those  three questions in order, I do not think the German people in the country districts which I visited can be  said to be starving  or  on the  verge ofstarvation,  though, even  there, food is tar from plentiful; but the  position in Berlin  isvery different.  There I should say that food is urgently needed.   Luxuries are to be had at a  price and figure on the daily menu cards of the best hotels and  restaurants ;but, apart  from luxuries,  even the restaurants have little to  offer, and in any  case theprices are so high that for  ordinary  people they can scarcely be  taken into  account.&quot; When are you going to send.us food ? &quot; was the first question on everyones lips.   1believe the distress with  regard to food in Berlin to be genuine,  and the scarcity to bea further danger to the cause of law  and order there, which  is  also menaced  by other causes.     4. The food difficulty  in Berlin and the other  industrial districts is increased bylack of transport.  This is undoubtedly real. By the 11th November, the train service hadalready been  enormously reduced, but since then the most drastic reductions have beenmade. The service to Frankfurt a.  Main, for  example, has, I believe, been reduced toa single train daily.   The service round Beeskow has been  reduced by about 50 percent.   I  should say that  the train service is at present insufficient for the needs of thecountry,  and  that any further  diminution will  seriously  increase the difficulties of preserving  the country from lapsing  into a state of chaos.     5. As  regards the government and administration of the  country, order was  wellkept while  I. was there.  In the  Beeskow district there was  no outward sign of changeafter  the revolution,  except the red flag floating over the barracks and the removal ofofficers&apos; epaulettes.  Even in Berlin  things are outwardly more or less normal.   Theordinary  bureaucratic machine is working, most of the Ministers remaining&apos; at  the headof their respective departments, each under the supervision of two socialists,  one from each party, appointed by the Cabinet of Six People&apos;s Commissaries (Volhsbeauftragten),known generally  as  the Ebert-Haase Government.   But  the atmosphere  is  tense.Berlin is  in terror of Bolshevism.   The political situation is not easy to describe.   TheEbert-Haase  Government  is, I  believe, supported as a Provisional Government by thegreat majority of the people,&apos; and the only serious clanger of  a counter-revolution is as  a reaction against Bolshevism.   There is, I believe, no desire whatever (except among theJunkers  and the  big  Industrialists) to  restore the Hohenzollerns or  the old regime.The old regime is regarded as responsible for the outbreak and for the long continuanceof the war, though, while  condemning their own Government,  there are  few, I think,who do  not also consider the Russian Government as partly sharing the blame.   the kaiser is  not, so  far as  I  could judge, generally regarded as personally responsible forthe war;  but  the discovery of the immense stores of food in the Imperial stbre-rooufe hashad a most damaging effect, and I think that any movement in  favour of his restorationwould be  doomed to  absolute failure; still  less  is there any  feeling in favour of theCrown Prince.     The supreme danger if one may judge from feeling in Berlin is Bolshevism.The  German  Bolshevists are  known as  the  Sjpartacus Bund, and  form a  separateorganization, within the framework of the  Independent Socialist Party, of those whodisapprove of the compromise between the two Socialist parties, which  resulted in theEbert-Haase  Government.   On Sunday, the 8th December, both Socialist,parties held aseries of  public meetings all over Berlin.   I attended a meeting of the IndependentSocialist  Party in  front of the Bismarck monument.  In spite of slight rain there was  acrowd of  about  2,000.   The first  speaker was StrObel,  a member  of  the  PrussianLandtag, who, Avhile attacking the Majority Socialists on  purely party lines, defendedthe  compromise  with them  and repudiated  Bolshevism.   &quot;You cannot,&quot; he  said,&quot;introduce Russian methods into Germany ; you cannot socialize in half an hour or half
 a year.&apos;&apos;&apos;   The second speaker, however, was a local leader of the Spartacus Bund from Wurttemberg, named  Ruck, and  his  speech  made  it  clear that  the  policy  of the Spartacus Bund is the policy of Bolshevism pure et simple.  The burden of his speech may be summed up in the following extract, which f took down at the time :           &quot;We do  not, as is charged against us, desire the dictatorship  of a  minority.     We  want Democracy, but true Democracy, the Democracy of the working classes,     which  is far better represented in the organized Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils     than in any constituent assembly.&quot;     He then  proceeded  to demand the disarming of all counter-revolutionaries, the dismissal of  all officers, the immediate socialization of banks,  &amp;c.     The meeting was orderly, though there was a good deal of interruption.   So far as I could judge, about one-fifth to one-quarter of those present  were in favour of the Spartacus speaker.     7. In the  afternoon  Liebknecht  held  a series of  meetings,  and there  Avas  a monster  procession down Unter den  Linden  of his followers,  150,000 in number, according to Hie lied Flag, his own organ; about 50,000 according to  his opponents. This procession,  however, was  quite orderly, contenting itself  witn  loud &quot; HocliS&quot; for  Liebknecht  and  Mosa  Luxemburg,  and  hooting  Eberb,  Haase, Scheidemann, (V.c, and  we found no difficulty in  crossing through  it as  it  turned  into the  Wilhelm- strasse.  Neukolln, a suburb of Berlin with about 250,000 inhabitants, is the stronghold of Liebknecht, and when  I  left Berlin his followers had a secure hold on the municipal administration  there.  The danger does not, however,  seem  to lie so much  in the strength  of the Spartacus Bund as in  the weakness of  the  Government.  The source  of that  weakness  lies   largely in the fact that it is a compromise.   The three  Majority  Socialist  members Ebert,  Scheidemann  and  Landsberg have,  I think,  undoubtedly  from  the  beginning  been- anxious to  call  the  Constituent Assembly  together   as  soon   as possible   and Nto   establish  an  orderly  and constitutional Government.   Of the three independent  Socialist  members, Haase and Dittmann appear to have been sobered somewhat by the responsibility of their position and to be co-operating ; but Barth,  the third independent Socialist  member, seems to be putting every  possible obstacle  in  the  way.   Moreover,  the truce  between  the two Socialist parties only extends to the sphere of  Government and not  to the elections to the  Constituent Assembly ;  so that the two parties are bitterly attacking one another in public meetings and the Press, while their leaders are endeavouring to cope  with the manifold problems before them.  Under such circumstances, strong united, action  on the part of the Cabinet  of Six  has  been almost  out  of the  question.  It is, I think, this state of facts which renders Berlin  so nervous of an attempt on the part  of Liebknecht and his followers  at a coup cVetat similar to  that  of Lenin and Trotsky.  It appears more probable daily that, if the  elections to the Constituent Assembly are held fairly, the  Majority Socialists and advanced bourgeois parties  will form the immense  majority between them; the hostility of the Spartaeus Bund to  the whole ide;  is  correspond- ingly increasing and with  it the danger or an  attempt to prevent the holding  of the election.  This is, I think, the explanation of the amazing fact that m fry of the  steady and orderly elements are almost looking forward to the occupation of Berlin by British troops.   There is, in my opinion,  no doubt as to this.  It was  both  stated and hinted to me on many  occasions;  while one of the sentries on guard in the Hotel Adlon  declared openly to Lieutenant Breen, Intelligence Corps (assisting  in the  repatriation  work at the British Embassy), that &quot; they would be glad  to see  the English arrive.&quot;   If the Allied Governments find themselves compelled to occupy Berlin, 1  am convinced that, whatever public  protests,  might  be made, either British or American troops  (I doubt whether this would apply to French troops)  would be  welcomed in Berlin by most of the  orderly elements of the  population with  secret satisfaction, especially  if the occupation were  to  be made  avowedly on the broad  ground that it was necessary for the maintenance of order and not merely for non-compliance with some of the terms of the Armistice.  Meanwhile I think that men like Ebert and Scheidemann whatever may be thought  of their attitude to the war must be regarded as  the  main political bulwark against Bolshevism.   Their fall from power would, I think, lead to complete chaos or military  dictatorship.     8. The troops, particularly the  troops back from the front, are, I think, an elementmaking for safety and order.  Their general attitude is that they have been  fighting for over four and a half years in the field and do  not now want to have  fighting at  home.Their demand is for peace, quiet and order.   In general they may be regarded, I  think,as loyal supporters  of the Ebert-Hasse  Government  and  as strongly opposed to the
Spartacus group.  The troops on the Eastern Front, so far from having been corruptedby the  proximity of Bolshevism, are  among its  most  determined opponents,  andrecently declared that  they would  not allow Russian Bolshevist delegates  to pass through their lines to attend a conference in Berlin.   The  &quot; Massacre of the Chaussee-strasse &quot; on the  6th December, when a detachment of the 5th Guard Fusiliers, who hadreceived orders to  bar  the Chausseestrasse to  a Spartacus procession, turned  theirmachine guns on the procession on very  slight provocation,  killing 11 and wounding40, may  be  regarded, I  think, as  due ,to  the instinctive desire  of  the troops to administer a lesson to  Liehknecht and his  followers, and  to remind them  that in anycoup cVetat they will have to reckon with the Berlin  garrison.     9.  The Soldiers&apos; Councils of the  various  units  and garrisons  (as opposed to the council&apos;s formed by groups of deserters, of whom there are many thousands in Berlin,and among whom Liebknecht is  carrying on a vigorous campaign of propaganda) are, Ibelieve, on the whole working smoothly and contributing to  the maintenance of order and discipline.  The Soldiers&apos; Councils formed on  the Western Front are  alleged  bythe Independent Socialists to be mere puppets in the hands of the  Supreme Command.This is, of course,  vigorously denied by their  members,  but I  had no  opportunity forming  any  opinion on  the subject.  There  seems,  however, to be  no doubt  thatdiscipline has been well maintained amongst troops returning from the Western Front.     10.  With regard to  the Workmens  Councils in the factories, precisely the oppositeappears to be the case.   Their  demands  are not  only extortionate as  regards wages,hours,  &amp;c, but in many cases extend to the  absolute  exclusion of their employers&apos;  fromthe works.    They seem to be gradually bringing about a state  of chaos and anarchy inthe industrial world.     11.  The Executive Committee (Vollzugsausschuss) of the Workinen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos;Councils of Berlin is  probably  the most unpopular  body in Germany.  Its incapacity,its lack of any clear policy, the lack of method in its proceedings,  the  violence of  itsdebates, its  arrogant claim to be the sole source of authority in Germany, from whomthe Ebert-Haase Government only holds  delegated authority to  act as  the  Executive,have all contributed  to its unpopularity.  But, in its way, I gather that it has attempted to preserve  order.   Berlin  is placarded  everywhere with  its  proclamations, orderingsoldiers  to  remain quietly with  their units pending demobilization, to maintain order,&amp;c.  And I am inclined to suspect that it may have served  a useful purpose in providing a  less  dangerous outlet for the exuberance of some of the  extremists than they might otherwise have found, and in averting still greater anarchy than it  has itself created.     12.  As regards the question of peace, it is a remarkable fact that, so far as I could see, there is  little or  no bitterness against the  British or Americans (and less than Ishould have expected against the French) either in Berlin or the  Beeskow district.  Noris  there any realization of the bitterness felt against them.   They seem to believe  thatall the atrocities of the war must be put down to the old regime, and that having sweptthat aside, they cannot now be held morally responsible for  them ; though., on the otherhand, I think they now recognize clearly  enough that they  will  have to pay  for the sinsof the old regime and are facing  the fact with such resignation as they can  muster.But there is one claim  which is repudiated by every party with   equal indignation, andthat is the Polish claim to West Prussia, or part of it, and  Danzig.   The Polish claims,whether based on history or nationality, are equally denied.  Passion  is likely, I think,to run higher on this than on any other question and, if the Polish claims in this directionshould be granted by the  Peace Conference, I  think that the Allied governments should be prepared for the  possibility of at least armed local resistance.   Since  writingthis 1 have spoken to General Rees as to  the state of German feeling towards the Polishclaims, and I gather  that his impressions correspond  to mine. -
