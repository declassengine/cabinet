      such as Shipbuilders, Railway men,  etc., are not re-      quired to be sent to the Employment Exchanges; and      when these are deducted there is practically no lag in      the forwarding of the -forms for the men.   There is a      certain lag in the case of Officers;  but this is only      temporary..                The figures of the number of men arriving      in this Country from Overseas on leave,., and returning      are watched week by week..   Last week there was a      considerable reduction in the excess of the numbers      arriving as compared with those returning.   During the      week under review, namely the week ended 11th January/.      the excess of the numbers arriving over those re-      turning amounted to 28,671.   The total excess since      the date of the Armistice amounts to 99,288.   As      stated above, 30,000 Officers end men have-been de-      mobilised whilst on leave.UNEMPLOYMENT.                Unemployment continues to increase...  The      total number of Out-of-Work Donation Policies remain-      ihg lodged on the 10th January was 449,252, being an      increase of nearly 70,000 as compared with the pre-      vious week.   This is larger than the increase which      was experienced during the preceding two weeks, and      is practically the same as the weekly rate of incre-      ment during the earlier weeks of December.    Of these      policies 65% are held by women and girls.

This represents 10,17$ of the total  Insurance books current in this Industry.    There is also the  large figure  of,179,940 persons drawing Out-of-Work Donation Benefit previously employed in what  are described as t!LTninsurable Occupations&quot;.          The  signs of recovery in industry referred to in the last Appreciation  are still apparent.  Al- though the total unemployment continues to increase, the  rate  of absorption is also  increasing.   The per- cent age of Out-of-V;ork Donation Policies remaining lodged,to total Policies issued continues to fall especially in  the oase of men as the  following figures show:  jerqontgge of Policies Lodged to Policies issue a\                 Men,.
