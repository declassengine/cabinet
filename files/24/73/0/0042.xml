                     ^QMDi^ JOB m m mm-           The Australian Government has proposed  that His kajesty&apos;s Government should co-operate directly with it in proving the oilfields of Papua, which are  believed to be of considerable value.           It is stated that public  feeling in Australia is much opposed to allowing this  territory to be exploited by any of the large oil companies of whioh several have applied for permission to prospect and at a conference at the Colonial  Office on 12th December Sir  Joseph Cook on behalf of the Commonwealth Government again  emphasised the strength of this feeling.           Lord HarcourVs Committee  on Imperial Petroleum Policy while recognising the importance  of developing these fields had not been able to advise direct participation by his iLajestysa Government whioh they felt might lead to. differences of opinion on policy, working,  control and- finance.           It has always been felt that Government should not, except in very special ciroumstances,  engage in speculative undertakings such as the working of oilfields, but these objections are not considered  necessarily  to attach with the same force to a scheme for tue preliminary investigation of the potentialities of a field  of prime  Imperial importance in which  expenditure would be  limited to a comparatively moderate  amount and which would not i&apos;n  itself involve                                             competition
 competition with private  interests  in the  commercial working; ot  the  field and  the marketing 01  the products, The  value of the territory having been tested it could then be  decided whether it should be developed cowner - oially  or be worked by Government for Imperial purposes.        Owing to  the strong&apos; views held on the subject by the  Commonwealth Government I have considered it with representatives  of the Admiralty, bombs-rd of Truie and the Treasury, and it was agreed to recommend that his Majesty&apos;s Government should co-operate to the extent of  50,000, a  similar sum being provided by Australia, and should  select experts to prospect the field.  The whole question would be considered de novo if and when oil is found in commercial quantities.         I recommend these proposals for approval both as affording an opportunity of testing vital Empire resources and as calculated to produce an excellent effect in Australia.    I have no doubt that the somewhat unsatisfactory course of the investigations which have hitherto been carried out under the Commonwealth will notbe repeated with the expert assistance which can now bemade available.                                     W.H.L.                                        10. 1. 19.
