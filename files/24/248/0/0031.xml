VERY SECRET. Copy No.     37CP. 95 (34).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Cabinet asked that on my return I should give them a review of the position in Palestine.1. On my way out Sir Arthur Wauchope came to stay with me in Cairo, and I had the opportunity of discussing with him all the outstanding problems. We have been very fortunate in avoiding any recurrence of the disorders and riots of last October/November. The High Commissioner has handled the situation firmly and skilfully. The Cabinet will remember that the Arabs had planned a series of demonstrations in commemoration of the men killed in the riots, and that we feared that there might be serious disturbances. The High Commissioner laid down clearly what would and would not be permitted in the way of meetings and demonstrations, and these orders were obeyed. But, although the situation appears outwardly calm, it is fundamentally unaltered.2. Fortunately the High Commissioner has acquired considerable influence with the Mufti of Jerusalem, who is unquestionably the most influential Moslem in Palestine to-day. If he were to throw in his lot with the extremists, I should regard the position as much more serious. It is therefore, of the utmost importance that the High Commissioner should maintain his influence with and ascendancy over the Mufti. In this connection it is very desirable to get a settlement as soon as possible of the Moslem claims to Wakf funds. The High Commissioner has come to a provisional agreement with the Mufti as regards this, which I hope will have been approved and settled by the time this paper reaches my colleagues.3. The Cabinet will remember that at the High Commissioners request I authorised him to appoint a tribunal &quot; to enquire into and report on events immediately preceding disturbances which took place in Palestine between the 13th October and the 3rd November; the precise sequence and nature of events within that period and resultant casualties and damage to property.&quot; The tribunal consisted of Sir William Murison, ex-Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements, and the Attorney-General of Palestine. With one exception non-official Arabs refused to give evidence; but the tribunal made a full investigation and their report is very satisfactory. After reciting in detail the facts of the riots, the report states that the immediate cause was the resolution of the Arab Executive to hold demonstrations,&apos; and the secondary cause was a desire to retaliate against the police. As regards the police, the tribunal expresses the opinion that in no instance did any member of the Force depart from, exceed, or fail to observe the standing instructions, which were themselves reasonable. The conduct of individual officers in charge at Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa is highly praised.4.   As the Cabinet know, illicit immigration has been going on on a large scale, and last year the figures assumed alarming proportions.  Special measures have been taken to combat this.  I have explained the position and the measures in the House of Commons, and there is, I think, general agreement that it is [9854] ^ biMMIIIMIIflTII^.....m:m ...........n-.........---............------.....__,_____^---- :    215Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1934.
essential that illicit immigration should be stopped, and that whatever number of immigrants it is possible to admit shall be authorised immigrants introduced through the proper channels. There was, however, a good deal of anxiety expressed whether illicit immigrants who had settled in Palestine and had found occupation would be expelled. The policy which, in fact, the High Commissioner is pursuing is to take the 2nd November, 1933. when the new measures were introduced and when it was made very plain that they would be strictly enforced, as a point of departure. Immigrants entering prior to that date who are now in employment or financially independent will not be disturbed unless they are for other reasons undesirable. They will, in fact, be treated as if they had entered as authorised immigrants. The law will be strictly enforced against illicit immigrants entering after that date. I have discussed this position fully with the High Commissioner, and, while he is prepared to carry out this policy by administrative order, and has, in fact, been doing so, he considers that it is impossible to make a public declaration to this effect. He says that if he were to do so, neither Jews nor -Arabs would believe that the law would be enforced in future.5. I, and the Under-Secretaries during my absence, have had most useful and helpful talks with Mr. Laski and Mr. Lionel Cohen, Chairman and Legal Chairman of the Jewish Board of Deputies, on this subject. They have been told in confidence what is being done. They regard it as reasonable; indeed, they made the same proposal themselves; they have accepted Sir Arthur Wauchope&apos;s opinion as to the impossibility of a public announcement; and they have, I know, done their best to satisfy their Board, without giving them the information which they themselves had received. I gather that the fact that they appeared satisfied went some way towards satisfying the Board.6. Both the High Commissioner and I felt that the Immigration Depart-ment in Palestine required strengthening and speeding up. The officer who presided over it is retiring, and the Department is being reorganised under Mr. Mills, the Assistant Chief Secretary, who has done admirable work on the census, and as reorganised in combination with a Statistical Office, the Depart-ment will, I. hope, do its work rapidly and efficiently.7. But there is no use blinking the fact that to-day Arabs and Jews are diametrically opposed on the whole subject of immigration. The Arabs claim that nothing will satisfy them except a complete embargo on all further immi-gration; and Jewish extremists do not make matters easier by their claims to unlimited immigration, and by their avowed determination to&apos;make Palestine not merely a National Home, but a Jewish State. As I have warned my colleagues before, Arab hostility is to-day not merely hostility to the Jews, but hostility to the British Government as.the authors of immigration.I shall have something to say about the broad issue later on, but there are certain questions of detail on which I think our policy must be clearly defined, though nothing is further from my intention than to issue another White Paper.8. There are three questions which are constantly cropping up with regard to immigration, upon which I wish to be sure that the High Commissioner and I are in agreement with the Cabinet. The&apos;first is easy. The Government has always maintained, and it is, I think, generally accepted, that immigration must be governed by the absorptive capacity of the country. In assessing absorptive capacity, the High Commissioner must take a reasonably long view. Every Jew who enters Palestine enters it as his permanent home; and the High Commis-sioner must be reasonably satisfied that, in fixing limits of immigration, there is a reasonable prospect that Palestine can permanently absorb these men and their children. Moreover, he certainly cannot disregard the normal increase :of Arab population. In this connection, it is important to remember that the 1931 census showed that, out of an Arab population of over 750,000, there were about 150,000 male Moslems under the age of 15.9. The second question is more difficult, viz., how far the High Commis-sioner is entitled to take into account Arab unemployment. The Jewish Agency in effect makes the claim that it ought to be disregarded, for they contend that, if Jewish money can find a job for a Jew, the Jew should be admitted.   I think
this is clearly contrary to the Prime Ministers letter to Dr. Weizmann, of which I append a copy. Paragraph 17 expressly dealt with this claim, and reads as follows : &quot; In determining the extent to which Immigration at any time may be permitted, it is necessary also to have regard to the declared policy of the Jewish Agency to the effect that in &apos; all the works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the Agency it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that Jewish labour shall be employed.&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not in any way challenge the right of the Agency to formulate or approve and endorse such a policy. The principle of prefei-ential and, indeed, exclusive employment of Jewish labour by Jewish organisations is a principle which the Jewish Agency are entitled to affirm. But it must be pointed out that, if in consequence of this policy A rab labour is displaced, or existing unemployment becomes aggravated, that is a factor in the situa-tion to which the Mandatory is bound to have regard.&quot;10. The difficulty comes in assessing how far Arab unemployment is or is likely to be caused or aggravated by Jewish immigration. The Jews contend that the influx of Jewish capital and the increased wealth of the country must create more employment for the Arabs. To some extent this is true. For example, Jewish oranges shipped through the Arab port of Jaffa and imports coming to that port improve Arab employment. It is probably also true that, but for the increased wealth and production of the country, the great extension of the port of Haifa would not have been undertaken. On the other hand, so long as the Jewish Agency maintains the position that only Jews will be employed on Jewish lands or Jewish works, that must tend to reduce Arab employment. Where land is sold to Jews who work on it themselves or employ only Jews, the Arabs in that area lose their seasonal employment on the land. In fact, they leave it altogether. In the same way, Arab tenants who are displaced, although they are generously compensated, do in fact in many cases become unemployed. We have indeed recognised this and are meeting it by the resettlement of displaced Arabs and by the new Land Legislation. There are also cases of Jews admitted to fill a particular job, who, when that job is finished or if it does not materialise, take on some other work which an Arab might have done. Nor can it be disputed that if Jewish labour is not available, Arabs would frequently obtain either temporary or permanent employment. In all the circumstances, and having regard to the terms of the Prime Ministers letter, Arab unemployment is a factor to which the High Commissioner must have regard; and he alone can be the judge of how far this unemployment has been or is likely to be aggravated by Jewish immigration.11. The third question arises over employment on public works. On this subject, in paragraph 16, the Prime Minister wrote : &quot; With regard to public and municipal works falling to be financed out of public funds, the claim of Jewish labour to a due share of the employment available, taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, shall be taken into consideration.&quot;If there are both Jews and Arabs unemployed, and available and suitable for the job, clearly the Jews are entitled to a fair proportion of the work. But if there are no Jews unemployed, or if the Jewish unemployed are provided for, then it is surely unreasonable to say that fresh Jewish immigrants must be admitted to do work which the Arab unemployed can do, thus leaving Arab unemployed to be kept on special relief or relief works. Indeed, if this were the policy, we should land ourselves in a really ridiculous position; for see what would happen : the Government has a programme of work; it could absorb Arab unemployed, but Jews must be imported to do part of this work; an additional programme is then provided in order to cater for the Arabs, but here again, more Jews must be brought in in order to preserve the balance. This seems to me a proposition which could not be defended in logic, or common sense.12. But all this only touches the fringe of the problem; and we must frankly realise that, however fairly and meticulously we administer our immigration system, we shall not resolve the enmity between Arab and Jew. Wherein lies the solution of this problem ?   The more I see of Palestine, the surer I become that[9854] b 2
the only real solution lies in the Jews abandoning the principle of the exclusive -employment of Jews, and showing in practice that Arabs benefit directly by Jewish land purchase and industrial development. I shall always remember a visit I paid to one of the Pica Colonies, founded many years ago by Baron Edmond de Rothschild. I had spent some days in visiting Jewish colonies and Arab towns and villages. I had never seen a Jew and an Arab together; and at the end of a long day I came to this colony above the Sea of Galilee. I was met by Jews and Arabs together. They came together into the village hall to bid me welcome. A Jew spoke first; he was followed by an old Arab, who said : &quot; We have been together here, Arabs and Jews, for forty years. We have worked together in good times and bad, and we must hold together. If the stones of the wall hold together, the wall stands; but if the stones come apart, the wall falls, -and much falls with it.&quot; In that colony there was peace, even in the riots of 1929.13. Such a change of policy will be anathema to the Jewish extremists. It will be difficult for Jewish leaders who see its wisdom and necessity. The theme of the prospectus on which they raise money is &quot; Jewish money for Jewish settlers,&quot; and when even the moderate Jewish leader is appealing to his constituents, I have no doubt that the picture of the Jewish National Home often expands into one of the Jewish State. But I think we ought to disseminate this idea as much as we can, and I am not without hope that it will be accepted. Sir Arthur Wauchope and I had a remarkable meeting with some of the most prominent Jews when he was home last summer. There were present Lord Reading, Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Sokolov (the official head of the Jewish Agency), Mr. Anthony Rothschild and Mr. Rutenberg. The meeting had been asked for by Dr. Weizmann, in order that I might try to smooth out difficulties between Zionists and non-Zionists. The meeting was, of course, confidential, and I could not publish or hold the people present to the opinions which they expressed, but we had the frankest possible talk. In the course of this talk the question of Jewish settlement in Trans-Jordan was raised. Everyone present accepted the proposition that no such development could take place until the High Commissioner was satisfied that it could take place with safety and goodwill. This led to their accepting the further proposition that they could not hope for such a situation unless Arabs on both sides of the Jordan were convinced that Jewish settlement was of direct benefit to them as well as to the Jews. They further agreed that probably the only way to achieve this would be to include Arabs now on the land in the development schemes which they contemplated in the Jordan Valley and at Huleh; and they were, indeed, in this frank discussion, inclined to agree that, if Jewish immigration were to continue on a substantial scale, they would in practice have to modify their policy. I am bound to say that Dr. Weizmann has since receded from this position, and in more recent speeches he reaffirmed the principle of exclusive Jewish employment.I think the wiser and more far-seeing Jews realise that if there were a serious outbreak in Palestine in which British lives were lost, strong feeling would be aroused in this country, and an almost irresistible demand might be made for an embargo on Jewish immigration.If the Arabs were cleverer propagandists, they could put their case against exclusive Jewish employment in a very telling way. They could say that the charge against Hitler is that he had refused Jews employment in Germany; is it reasonable that Jewish immigrants to Palestine, entering in increasing numbers, should refuse employment to the Arab population?14. I ought also to mention-the question of the Legislative Council. I wish, personally, that the proposal had never been made, but we cannot get away from the situation which has been created. The Cabinet is familiar with the long history of this business; the original proposals, and their rejection by the Arabs. We are unfortunately absolutely committed by undertakings given in Parliament and to the Permanent Mandates Commission to make another attempt. The Arabs are very insistent that we should carry out these undertakings, while at present the Jews are opposed to the setting up of a Legislative Council. Our declared policy is that the reform of local government must come first, and that we cannot establish a Legislative Council until the new local authorities are established and working. These local authorities are now in process of appoint-ment, and we shall soon have to produce our proposals for a Legislative Council.
I have made it plain that such a Council could have no executive authority, and that the power of the High Commissioner to ensure the passage of measures which he thinks essential should remain unimpaired, and that he would, of course, have the power of veto, which exists in all Colonies. Provided the High Commissioner has these powers, I do not myself attach much importance to an official majority. Indeed, I rather dislike the camouflage of a voting bloc of officials, some of whom are not concerned in any way with the matters in question, and who are taken away from their proper work. In this the High Commissioner shares my view.But it will naturally be asked &apos;&apos; How can you hope to satisfy Arabs by the establishment of so powerless a Council?&quot; I discussed this with several influential Arabs when I was in Palestine last year. I told them frankly how limited the powers of any Council must be. I presumed the first thing the Arabs would do if a Council were established would be to vote solidly for a resolution prohibiting the sale of land to Jews, and the entry of any more Jews into Palestine. They agreed. I then said : &quot;You realise that the Government must disregard any such resolution. Would you not then say that the Council was a mockery, and walk out?&quot; They said: &quot;No. We should no doubt register vehement protests; but we should go on to discuss and try to mould the legislation which came before us.&quot; I do not venture to predict whether a Council of the only kind we can contemplate will, in fact, be accepted, or, if it is accepted, how it will work; and I have no concrete proposals to put before my colleagues at the present time. But I am sure that as things stand we cannot escape our commit-ments, and we must in due course put forward our proposals. . .(Initialled) P. C.-L.Colonial Office, Downing Street, March 28, 1934.o
Printed for the use of the Colonial Office.Middle East. No. 39.Confidential.PalestineLetter from  the  Prime Minister Dr. Ch. Weizmann.13th February, 1931.
PalestineLetter from the Prime Minister to Dr. Ch. Weizmann.10, Downing Street,Whitehall, 13th February, 1931.Dear De. Weizmann,In order to remove certain misconceptions and rnisunderstand-ings which have arisen as to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with regard to Palestine, as set forth in the White Paper of October, 1930,* and which were the subject of a Debate in the House of Commons on the 17th November, and also to meet certain criticisms put forward by the Jewish Agency, I have pleasure in forwarding you the following statement of our position, which will fall to be read as the authoritative interpretation of the White Paper on the matters with which this letter deals.2. It has been said that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government involves a serious departure from the obligations of the Mandate as hitherto understood, that it misconceives the Mandatory obliga-tions, and that it foreshadows a policy which is inconsistent with the obligations of the Mandatory to the Jewish people.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government did not regard it as necessary to quote in extenso the declarations of policy which have been pre-viously made, but attention is drawn to the fact that, not only does the White Paper of 1930 refer to and endorse the White Paper of 1922, t which has been accepted by the Jewish Agency, but it recognises that the undertaking of the Mandate is an under-taking to the Jewish people and not only to the Jewish population of Palestine. The White Paper placed in the foreground of its statement my speech in the House of Commons on the 3rd April, 1930, in which I announced in words which could not have been made more plain, that it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to administer Palestine in accordance with the terms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the League of Nations. That position has been reaffirmed and again made plain by my speech in the House of Commons on the 17th November. In my speech on the 3rd April I used the following language : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to administer Palestine in accordance with the terms of the Mandate as approved by the Council of the League of Nations. This is an international obligation from which there can be no question of receding.* Cmd. 3692.t Cmd. 1700.
&quot; Under the terms of the Mandate His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are responsible for promoting &apos; the establishment in Pales-tine of a National Home for the Jewish people, it being clearly-understood that nothing shall be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communi-ties in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&apos;&quot; A double undertaking is involved, to the Jewish people on the one hand, and to the non-Jewish population of Palestine on the other; and it is the firm resolve of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give effect, in equal measure, to both parts of the Declaration, and to do equal justice to all sections of the population of Palestine. That is a duty from which they will not shrink, and to the discharge of which they will apply all the resources at their command.&quot;That declaration is in conformity not only with the articles, but also with the preamble of the Mandate, which is hereby explicitly reaffirmed.4. In carrying out the policy of the Mandate the Mandatory cannot ignore the existence of differing interests and viewpoints. These, indeed, are not in themselves irreconcilable, but they   can only be reconciled if there is a proper realisation that the full solution of the problem depends on an understanding between the Jews and the Arabs. Until that is reached, considerations of balance must inevitably enter into the definition of policy.5. A good deal of criticism has been directed to the White Paper upon the assertion that it contains injurious allegations against the Jewish people and Jewish Labour organization. Any such intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government is expressly disavowed. It is recognised that the Jewish Agency have all along given willing co-operation in carrying out the policy of the Man-date, and that the constructive work done by the Jewish people in Palestine has had beneficial effects on the development and well-being of the country as a whole. His Majesty&apos;s Government also recognise the value of the services of labour and trades union organization in Palestine, to which they desire to give every en-encouragement.6. A question has arisen as to the meaning to be attached to the words &apos;&apos; safeguarding the civil and religious rights of all inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion,&quot; occurring in article 2, and the words &quot; ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced,&quot; occurring in article 6 of the Mandate. The words &quot; safeguarding the civil and religious rights,&quot; occurring in article 2, cannot be read as meaning that the civil and religious rights of individual citizens are to be unalterable. In the case of Suleiman Hurra, to which reference has been made, the Privy Council, in construing these words of article 2, said :
&apos;&apos; It does not mean . . . that all the civil rights of every in-habitant of Palestine which existed at the date of the Mandate are to remain unaltered throughout its duration; for if this were to be a condition of the Mandatory jurisdiction, no effective legisla-tion would be possible.&quot; The words, accordingly, must be read in another sense, and the key to the true purpose and meaning of the sentence is to be found in the concluding words of the article : &quot;-&apos; irrespective of race and religion.&quot; These words indicate that, in respect of civil and religious rights, the Mandatory is not to discriminate between persons on the ground of religion or race, and this protective provision applies equally to Jews, Arabs, and all sections of the population.7. The words &quot; rights and position of other sections of the popu-lation,&quot; occurring in article 6, plainly refer to the non-Jewish community. These rights and position are not to be prejudiced, that is, are not to be impaired or made worse. The effect of the policy of immigration and settlement on the economic position of the non-Jewish community cannot be excluded from consideration. But the words are not to be read as implying that existing economic conditions in Palestine should be crystallised. On the contrary, the obligation to facilitate Jewish immigration and to encourage close settlement by Jews on the land, remains a positive obligation of the Mandate, and it can be fulfilled without prejudice to the rights and position of other sections of the population of Palestine.8. We may proceed to the contention that the Mandate has been reinterpreted in a manner highly prejudicial to Jewish interests in the vital matters of land settlement and immigration. It has been said that the policy of the White Paper would place an embargo upon immigration, and would suspend, if not, indeed, terminate, the close settlement of the Jews on the land, which is a primary purpose of the Mandate. In support of this contention particular stress has been laid upon the passage referring to State lands in the White Paper, which says that &quot; it would not be possible to make these areas available for Jewish settlement in view of then-actual occupation by Arab cultivators, and of the importance of making available additional land on which to place the Arab culti-cultivators who are now landless.&quot;9. The language of this passage needs to be read in the light of the policy as a whole. It is desirable to make it clear that the landless Arabs, to whom it was intended to refer in the passage quoted, were such Arabs as can be shown to have been displaced from the lands which they occupied in consequence of the lands passing into Jewish hands, and who have not obtained other hold-ings on which they can establish themselves or other equally satisfactory occupation. The number of such displaced Arabs must be a matter for careful enquiry. It is to landless Arabs within this category that His Majesty&apos;s Government feel themselves under
an obligation to facilitate their settlement upon the land. The recognition of this obligation in no way detracts from the larger purposes of development, which His Majesty&apos;s Government regards as the most effectual means of furthering the establishment of-a National Home for the Jews.10. In framing a policy of land settlement, it is essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take into consideration every circumstance that is relevant to the main purposes of the Mandate. The area of cultivable land, the possibilities of irrigation, the absorptive capacity of the country in relation to immigration are all elements pertinent to the issues to be elucidated, and the neglect of any one of them would be prejudicial to the formulation of a just and stable policy.It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to institute an enquiry as soon as possible to ascertain, inter alia, what State and other lands are, or properly can be made, available for close settle-ment by Jews under reference to the obligation imposed upon the Mandatory by article 6 of the Mandate. This enquiry will be com-prehensive in its scope, and will include the whole land resources of Palestine. In the conduct of the enquiry provision will be made for all interests, whether Jewish or Arab, making such representations as it may be desired to put forward.11. The question of the congestion amongst the fellahin in the hill districts of Palestine is receiving the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is contemplated that measures will be devised for the improvement and intensive development of the land, and.for bringing into cultivation areas which hitherto may have remained uncultivated, and thereby securing to the fellahin a better standard of living, without save in exceptional eases, having recourse to transfer.12. In giving effect to the policy of land settlement, as contem-plated in article 11 of the Mandate, it is necessary, if disorgaiiiza-tion is to be avoided, and if the policy is to have a chance to succeed, that there should exist some centralised control of trans-actions relating to the acquisition and transfer of land during such interim period as may reasonably be necessary to place the de-velopment scheme upon a sure foundation. The power contem-plated is regulative and not prohibitory, although it does involve a power to prevent transactions which are inconsistent with the tenor of the scheme. But the exercise of the power will be limited and in no respect arbitrary. In every case it will be conditioned by considerations as to how best to give effect to the purposes of the Mandate. Any control contemplated will be fenced with due safeguards to secure as little interference as possible with the free transfer of land. The centralised control will take effect as from such date only as the authority charged with the duty of carrying
out the policy of land development shall begin to operate. The High Commissioner will, pending the establishment of such centralised control, have full powers to take all steps necessary to protect the tenancy and occupancy rights, including the rights of squatters, throughout Palestine.13. Further, the statement of policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment did not imply a prohibition of acquisition of additional land by Jews. It contains no such prohibition, nor is any such intended. What it does contemplate is such temporary control of land disposi-tion and transfers as may be necessary, not to impair the harmony and effectiveness of the scheme of land settlement to be under-taken. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to point out that they alone of the Governments which have been responsible for the administration of Palestine since the acceptance of the Mandate have declared their definite intention to initiate an active policy of development which it is believed will result in substantial and lasting benefit to both Jews and Arabs.14. Cognate to this question is the control of Immigration. It must, first of all, be pointed out that such control is not in any sense a departure from previous policy. From 1920 onwards, when the original Immigration Ordinance came into force, regulations for the control of Immigration have been issued from time to time, directed to prevent illicit entry and to define and facilitate authorised entry. This right of regulation has at no time been challenged.15. But the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government appears to have been represented as being that &quot; no further immigration of Jews is to be permitted so long as it might prevent any Arab from obtaining employment.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government never pro-posed to pursue such a policy. They were concerned to state that, in the regulation of Jewish immigration, the following principles should apply, viz., that &quot; it is essential to ensure that the immi-grants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment &quot; (White Paper, 1922). In the one aspect His Majesty&apos;s Government have to be mindful of their obligations to facilitate Jewish Immigration under suitable condi-tions, and to encourage close settlement of Jews on the land; in the other aspect they have to be equally mindful of their duty to ensure that no prejudice results to the rights and position of the non-Jewish community. It is because of this apparent conflict of obligations that His Majesty&apos;s Government have felt bound to emphasise the necessity of the proper application of the absorptive capacity principle. That principle is vital to any scheme of development, the primary purpose of which must be the settlement both of Jews and of displaced Arabs upon the land.   It is for that
reason that His Majesty&apos;s Government have insisted, and are compelled to insist, that Government control of immigration must be maintained and that immigration regulations must be properly applied. The considerations relevant to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic considerations.16. His Majesty&apos;s Government did not prescribe and do not contemplate any stoppage or prohibition of Jewish immigration in any of its categories. The practice of sanctioning a &quot; Labour Schedule &quot; of wage-earning immigrants will continue. In each case consideration will be given to anticipated labour requirements for works which, being dependent on Jewish or mainly Jewish capital, would not be or would not have been undertaken unless Jewish labour was made available. With regard to public and municipal works falling to be financed out of public funds, the claim of Jewish labour to a due share of the employment avail-able, taking into account Jewish contributions to public revenue, shall be taken into consideration. As regards other kinds of employment, it will be necessary in each case to take into account the faetors bearing upon the demand for labour, including the factor of unemployment amongst both the Jews and the Arabs. Immigrants with prospects of employment other than employment of a purely ephemeral character will riot be excluded on the sole ground that the employment cannot be guaranteed to be of unlimited duration.17. In determining the extent to which Immigration at any time may be permitted, it is necessary also to have regard to the declared policy of the Jewish Agency to the effect that in &quot; all the works or undertakings carried out or furthered by the Agency it shall be deemed to be a matter of principle that Jewish labour shall be employed.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government do not in any way challenge the right of the Agency to formulate or approve and endorse such a policy. The principle of preferential and, indeed, exclusive employment of Jewish labour by Jewish organiza-tions is a principle which the Jewish Agency are entitled to affirm. But it must be pointed out that if in consequence of this policy Arab labour is displaced or existing unemployment becomes aggra-vated, that is a factor in the situation to which the Mandatory is bound to have regard.18. His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to say finally, as they have repeatedly and unequivocally affirmed, that the obligations imposed upon the Mandatory, by its acceptance of the Mandate, are solemn international obligations, from which there is not now, nor has there been at any time, an intention to depart. To the tasks imposed by the Mandate His Majesty&apos;s Government have set their hand, and they will not withdraw it. But if their efforts are to be successful there is need for co-operation, confidence, readiness on all sides to appreciate the difficulties and complexities
of the problem, and, above all, there must be a full and unqualified recognition that no solution can be satisfactory or permanent which is not based upon justice, both to the Jewish people and to the non-Jewish communities of Palestine.I am, my dear Dr. Weizmann, Yours very sincerely,J. RAMSAY MACD0NAL1J.The President of theJewish Agency.(*305-l)  Wt. 26372-G39/1085 BOO 3/31 P.St
