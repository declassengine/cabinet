MOST SECRET. Copy No.  47CP. 78 (34).CABINET.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.Report of the Defence Requirements Committee.A attitude of the Dominions in regard to the Termination in 1921 of theA nglo- Japanese A lliance.IN connexion with question 26 in the Note by the Prime Minister, dated the 12th March (CP. 70 (34)), I circulate to my colleagues the annexed historical note, prepared in the Dominions Office, on the Attitude of the Dominions in regard to the Termination in 1921 of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.(Initialled) J. H. T.Dominions Office, March 15, 1934.1. IN July 1920, the Governments of Japan and Great Britain informed the League of Nations that they recognised the principle that, if the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of 1911 were continued after July 1921, it must be in a form which was not inconsistent with the Covenant of the League. In informing the Dominion Governments in advance of this proposed communication it was pointed out that the declaration did not commit the Government to renew the alliance in its present or any other form.2. The Canadian and Union Governments indicated that they had no objection to the proposed course of action; early in 1921, however, Mr. Meighen, the Canadian Prime Minister, sent a private and personal telegram to Mr. Lloyd George, in which he stated that he felt that every possible effort should be made to find some alternative policy to that of renewal, and pointed out that conditions had so altered that defence motives no longer held good, while the objections against renewal had greatly increased; he further emphasised the need for promoting good relations with the United States and indicated that he felt that there was a danger that a special confidential relationship between the British Empire and Japan concerning the Pacific, the United States not being a party, might come to be regarded as an unfriendly exclusion and a barrier to an English-speaking concord. He suggested a termination of the alliance and an immediate conference of Pacific Powers. In further correspondence, he stressed the very special position of Canada in the matter, and said that it might become necessary to consider an alternative solution by which only those parts of the Empire desiring to do sO should join in the renewal of the alliance.3. The question was subsequently considered at the Conference of Prime Ministers and Representatives of the United Kingdom, Dominions and India held in the summer of 1921, and formed, indeed, the main subject of discussion.4. During these discussions, Mr. Meighen (the Canadian Prime Minister) stated the case against renewal : he pointed out that the situation had changed since 1902 in that the Treaty had been framed to meet a Russian menace and, on its renewal in 1911, a German menace, but that both these menaces had now been removed.  In fact the Treaty had served its purpose, and the arguments for[9799]----   113Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1.934.
its renewal no longer existed: Canada was in any case averse from any alliances at that&apos; time; regarding them as likely to subvert the purposes of the League Covenant, and, moreover, he did not believe it possible to have an agreement in any form that would be really satisfactory to the United States, good relations with whom were a matter of vital concern to Canada. Mr. Meighen said he would regret to see the Treaty continued in any form at all, and he accordingly recommended that conversations should be immediately pursued with the United States, pointing to the need for a tripartite arrangement.5. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia (Mr. Hughes) replied to Mr. Meighen&apos;s presentation of the case, which he described as &quot; not the case for the Empire, but the case for the United States of America,&quot; and stressed that Canada&apos;s interests were not greater than Australia^. He drew attention to the danger to Australia&apos;s position if the Treaty were not renewed, and doubted whether refusal to renew would in fact assure us the friendship of the American people. Mr. Hughes pointed out that J apan had been a useful ally during the Great War, but at the same time he made it clear that Australia would never range herself against the United States. He stated that he was in favour of an immediate declaration of our intentions to renew the Alliance upon terms that would be at once compatible with the Covenant of the League of Nations, and which would give America ample opportunity to be officially consulted. On these conditions, he recommended the immediate renewal of the Treaty.6. The Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Massey) also pointed to the danger of delay, and stressed the importance of an immediate decision. He was of opinion that refusal to renew would show ingratitude to Japan, and would mean the loss of respect to other nations. He further pointed out that a continuance of the Treaty meant a certain control over Japan. He accordingly recommended that the Treaty should be renewed, but that at the same time every-thing possible should be done to promote friendly understanding with, the United States.7. The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa (General Smuts) expressed the view that nothing must be done to antagonize Japan, but that at the same time it was essential to avoid cleavage with the United States. He pointed out that an agreement of the character proposed- i.e., specifically excluding the United States, and all reference to military co-operation as the League of Nations required, would be hardly calculated to please Japan. General Smuts was in favour of the policy advocated by the United States Secretary of State, i.e., that a declaration of policy should be embodied in an exchange of notes. He felt that Conferences were the only solution to the Pacific problem, and had no objection to renewal of the Alliance for a year to allow time for consultation with the United States.8. In a statement made to the House of Commons on the 11th July, 1921, representing the general view of all the members of the Conference, referred to in paragraph 3, on the main issues of the Pacific, Mr. Lloyd George said that we were guided by the consideration that in Japan we had an old and proved Ally and that the agreement of twenty years&apos; standing-had been of very great benefit not only to ourselves and her, but to the peace of the Far East, while in the United States we saw the people closest to our own aims and ideals with whom it was for us a deeply-rooted instinct to consult and co-operate. He explained that it was the desire of the British Empire and Japan that the agreement should be brought into complete harmony with the Covenant of the League of Nations; that on the broader issues, we desired friendly co-operation with the United States (on which, more than on any other single factor, depended the peace of the world), the maintenance of our close friendship and co-operation with Japan, the preservation of the open door in China, the safeguarding of our own vital interests in the Pacific and the avoidance of competition in naval armaments between the Pacific Powers; further, that all the representatives of the Empire were agreed that our standpoint on these questions should be communicated with complete frankness to the United States, Japan and China, with a view to an exchange of opinions, which might lead to more formal discussion.9. Finally it was unanimously decided to accept the invitation of President Harding that the Limitation of Armament Conference at Washington should include discussion of Pacific questions.
10. At the Washington Conference, the British Empire Delegates were Lord (then Mr.) Balfour, Lord Lee of Fareham, Sir Auckland Geddes, Sir R. Borden (Canada), Senator Pearce (Australia), Sir John Salmond (New Zealand), Lord Balfour (Union of South Africa), and Mr. Sastri (India).11. In November 1921, Lord Balfour drew up a draft Tripartite Agreement, the objects of which he stated, inter alia, to be (1) To enable America to be a party without committing themselves to military operations. (2) To terminate the Alliance without hurting the feelings of Japan. (3) To leave it open to the British Empire to renew the alliance in certaincircumstances.(4) To frame a treaty which would reassure Australia and New Zealand.In forwarding this draft to London, he stated that he thought that the other British Empire Delegates were in general agreement with the line proposed.12. Subsequently, this draft underwent considerable change, largely, it would appear, as the result of a Japanese counterdraft, and took the form of an Agreenient between the United States of America, the British Empire, France and Japan to respect each other&apos;s rights in relation to their insular possessions and insular dominions in the Pacific, and to consult together in case of controversy between them or in case of a threat by any other Power. It further provided that, on ratification of the agreement, the Anglo-Japanese Treaty would terminate.13. Details of the consultation between Dominion Governments and the Dominion Delegates at Washington as to the terms of the draft Treaty are not available, but Senator Pearce announced at a meeting of the British Empire Delegation on the 9th December that his Government had approved the draft agreement.14. The agreement was finally signed on the 13th December, 1921, as the &quot; Quadruple Treaty,&quot; by all the British Empire Delegates mentioned in paragraph 10 above, Sir R. Borden signing separately for Canada, Senator Pearce for the Commonwealth of Australia, Sir John Salmond for New Zealand, Lord Balfour for the Union of South Africa and Mr. Sastri for India.15. It may be noted in this connexion that at a British Empire Delegation Meeting, held on the 10th December, Senator Pearce, on behalf of the Common-wealth of Australia, asked to record his gratitude to Mr. Balfour for his successful efforts in the conclusion of the quadruple agreement, and that Sir John Salmond, on behalf of New Zealand, associated himself with this resolution. The British Empire Delegation as a whole cordially associated themselves with these remarks.Dominions Office, March 13, 1934.
