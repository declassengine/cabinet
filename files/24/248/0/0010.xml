Copy No.CP. 75 (34).CABINET.TITHE RENTCHARGE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE position with regard to tithe rentcharge has been receiving my consideration for some time past.2. Tithe rentcharge is a liability on the owner of agricultural land and not on the occupier, but the considerable increase in the number of occupying-owners-has tended to make the matter more of a farmer&apos;s problem than was previously the case.3. In certain areas there has been widespread resistance to payment of tithe rentcharge, and disorder has taken place at auction sales following on distraint for unpaid tithe rentcharge, and the law has been brought into disrepute. As a result, auction sales cannot be conducted in some districts, and the alternative&apos; method of selling distrained goods by tender has not proved altogether successful.4. I have received deputations from the Central Landowners&apos; Association, the National Farmers&apos; Union, and the Conservative Parliamentary Agricultural Committee as representing tithe payers, and also a deputation from representa-tives of tithe owners, including Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Welsh Church Commission, and Oxford and Cambridge colleges.5. The representatives of tithe payers put forward a claim for increased remission of annual tithe rentcharge owing to the agricultural depression, and for an inquiry into the whole question of tithe rentcharge, including the operation of the Tithe Act, 1925, which stabilised the annual value of tithe rentcharge.6. The representatives of tithe owners maintained that there was no necessity for an inquiry into the whole position, and urged that the fact that there was an agitation against the payment of tithe rentcharge, and an organised opposition to the operation of the law, was not sufficient justification for action by the Government.7. I have been in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, who holds the view that the law relating to distress in the matter of the recovery of tithe rentcharge is so involved and so uncertain that the position causes the greatest uneasiness, and that, generally speaking, County Courts and their officers are in a position of the greatest difficulty in recovering tithe rentcharge by distress in the face of organised opposition.8. In view of the comparatively short period which has elapsed since the passing of the Act of 1925, I am not satisfied that a case has been made out for an inquiry into the whole question. On the other hand, having regard to the heavy fall in the prices of agricultural produce, there is no doubt that owner-occupiers in some districts are finding very great difficulty in meeting their[9801]
liabilities, including tithe rentcharge.- Moreoy.erj:tb.e view of the. Lord; Chancellor l-indicates. a state of affairs, which tends to bring:the:Jaw,into disrepute.a:; r:&quot;9p;&apos;i&apos;%hihk therefore that from trie tithe payers&apos; point of - view there is a case for amending the law so as to bring relief to the hard cases, and from the3 tithe owners&apos; point of view there is a case for introducing improved methods of recovery of tithe rentcharge.10. Under the Tithe Act, 1891, a landowner can obtain remission of so much of the tithe rentcharge as exceeds two-thirds of the Schedule B assessment. To obtain this statutory relief he must appear as respondent to an application by the tithe owner in the County Court for recovery of the whole tithe rentcharge.11. I recommend that the tithe payer should be enabled to obtain remission on production of a certificate by the Surveyor of Taxes of the Schedule B Assessment without the trouble and expense of attendance before the County Court.12. A ready means of affording relief to the hard cases can be secured by reducing the fraction of two-thirds referred to in paragraph 10 above, and I have reason to suppose that tithe owners would not actively oppose this in principle, although, of course, the actual figure is a matter of great importance to them.13. I have considered the probable effect of reduction of the figure to (a) six-fifteenths or (b) five-fifteenths. Proposal (a) would, it is estimated, involve a total remission of roughly  170,000 per annum. Under Proposal (b) the figure would be approximately  250,000. The estimated total annual amount of tithe rentcharge (including sinking fund in the case of ecclesiastical tithe rentcharge) is  3,406,000.14. From informal and confidential conversation which I have had with representatives of tithe owners, I have reason to suppose that they would not actively oppose an alteration to six-fifteenths, but would strongly resist an alteration.to five-fifteenths.15. In all the circumstances I am inclined to recommend the adoption of the figure of six-fifteenths, but I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues on this question.16. I also recommend that the tithe owner should be enabled to obtain automatic remission of rates proportionate to the remission of the tithe rentcharge. This may result in a saving to the Exchequer of  42,000 under proposal (a) and  60,000 under proposal (b). The point is rather technical, and is dealt with in more detail in the short appendix to this memorandum.17. As regards recovery, the present method is by distraint where the landowner is in occupation, and in other cases by the appointment of- a receiver of the rent of the land. I recommend that, as an alternative, the tithe owner shall be empowered to proceed by action in the County Court against the landowner for recovery of any arrears of tithe rentcharge. The Lord Chancellor concurs in this proposal.18. Proposals on these lines will not satisfy the extremists concerned in the tithe agitation, who appear to contemplate wholesale confiscation of the tithe owners&apos; property. The informal conversations which I have had with leading-representatives of the more moderate element represented by the National Farmers&apos; Union and the Central Landowners&apos; Association lead me to believe that these proposals would be accepted as a reasonable contribution towards meeting present-day difficulties. The National Farmers&apos; Union will, of course, reserve their position with regard to the Tithe Act, 1925, which they have never accepted as a permanent settlement.Summary.19. I therefore ask for authority to introduce a Bill amending the Tithe Act, 1891, in the following manner: (1) To simplify the procedure under which remission of tithe rentcharge can be obtained, in particular by saving the tithe payer the expense and trouble of attendance before the County Court.
:    (2) To increase the amount of remission&apos; which a tithe payer may :&apos;obtain, based on -the rental value of the land for the purpose of ,; ;&apos;: w Schedule.B Income Tax,,;by altering thefigure of two-thirds to, . (one-third)&apos; (two-fifths). (3) To provide for automatic remission of rates on tithe rentchargeproportionate to the remission. (4) To provide a more modern procedure for recovering tithe rentcharge.1 0  The Bill, I suggest, would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.(Initialled)W. E.

APPENDIX.UNDER the Tithe Act, 1925, the whole of the rates on tithe rentcharge vested in Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty are paid by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, who receive fixed contributions from the Bounty of  5 for every  100 tithe rentcharge previously attached to benefices and  16 per cent, in respect of tithe rentcharge previously owned by ecclesiastical corporations. Assuming rates at 10s. in the  , it is estimated that the amount of rates remitted under the alternative proposals would be as follows :-! Tithe Rentcharge remitted.Hates remitted.1 Bounty. - i i		Other Owners.	Total.	Bounty Tithe Bent-charge.	Other Owners.	Total.(a)  emission  in   excess of  six-fif-teenths of Schedule B ... (b) Eemission   in   excess   of   five-. fifteenths of Schedule B	  &apos; 125,000 180,000	&amp; 45,000 70,000	&amp; &apos;&quot; 170,000 250,000	  42,000 60,000	.  15,000 23,000	&amp; -57,000 83,000These sums of  57,000 or  83,000, of which  42,000 or  60,000 respectively would be a saving to the Exchequer, will represent an increased liability on the general body of ratepayers, this being the principle which already governs the procedure under the Tithe Act, 1891.o
