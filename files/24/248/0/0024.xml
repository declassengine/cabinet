Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.   lay colleagues will remember that negotiations took place last year with Latvia for the purpose of safeguarding our export trade in herrings to that country.   These negotiations resulted in the temporary igre^ment of 6th July, 1933, ?&apos;hich re-established our herring trade with Latvia and provided,  in return, for guarantees as to the treatment of Latvian exports of agricultural products to the United Kingdom.   Negotiations were begun on the 6th January,  1934, for the replacement of this temporary agreement toy one of longer term and wider scope.    .^ substantial measure of agreement has now been reached and I hope it may be possible to conclude the negotiations before faster.2.    Latvia, as the figures oelow indicate,  is not a large, market for the United Kingdom;, but our herring trade to Latvia is important and our unfavourable balance of trade affords opportunity of obtaining an increase in the export of oth.-.r United Kingdom goods to that country:United Kinpdom - Latvia Trade.1 Imports into theIUnited Kingdom i Balance adverse United Kingdom! exports and     j   to the United from Latvia.      re-exports to i        Kingdom.11929 1930 1931 1932 1933  million,   ii5.474.75 i2.932.67P. 64        !  million.1.63 1.25.62.63 1.19  million.3.83 5.50 2.31 2.03 1.45-1-
In 1929, the United Kingdom took about 27 per cent, of Latvian exports and supplied about 8 per cent, of her imports, Germany took about the same percentage of exports and supplied 41 per cent, of imports.    In 1932, the United Kingdom share of Latvian exports had risen to 31 per cent, and of Latvian imports to nearly 14 per cent; the corresponding figures for Germany being 26 and 35 per cent.    In 1933 the United Kingdom shares were about 44 per cent, of exports and 22 per cent, of imports; the German shares being 23 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively.    Latvia&apos;s dependence on this country for hr-r exports, mainly agricultural, has, therefore, greatly increased as has also our share of her imports.3.    I annex an estimate made in the Board of Trade of the benefits to United Kingdom trade which will result from an Agreement on the lines at present contemplated.    It will be seen that in the main the agreement will consolidate the substantial gain (i.e. an increase of  500,000 in United Kingdom exports and re-exports to Latvia over 1932 figures) which resulted in 1933 from the efforts made by the Latvian Government to increase Latvian purchases from this country, but an appreciable further improvement of&apos; trade (say  200,000 over 1933 figures) should also result.4.    Two important features of the Latvian system are theimport restrictions which cover a large number of articles and the exchange control,   Special provisions will beincluded in the Agreement to secure favourable operation ofthe import licence system and guarantees as to the provisionof exchange.    Ve shall also secure specific guarantees in theform of purchase agreements for the export to Latvia of anumber of articles, in particular iron and steel, creosoteand coal tar, and supplies for the woodworking industries.The Latvian Government will give, a minimum guarantee of 70per cent, of the Latvian imports of coal and an undertakingwith regard to coke.   There will also be a number of useful-2-
tariff reductions, and an appreciable reduction in the licence fees for commercial travellers.   As indicated in the annex, two important questions are still outstanding, namely, the quantities of salt herrings and of cotton and wool textiles to he licensed for importation into Latvia.5.   The principal concession to he given to Latvia in return is the confirmation in respect of Latvian goods of the guarantees in regard to agricultural products, and the reduced duties on certain industrial products (in particular flax, timber products and certain kinds of paper) already accorded to the Scandinavian countries.    I should explain that Latvia, by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clause of her Commercial Treaty of 1923 with the United Kingdom, already enjoys these guarantees and duty reductions.    The possibility of denunciation of that Treaty to be followed after its expiry by discriminatory action against Latvian goods has provided the principal encouragement to the Latvians to continue negotiations.    It is not proposed to accord any new reductions of duty in favour of Latvia in the present Treaty.    She has, however,  Been offered a slight increase in the amount of butter that she will be permitted to send to this country, in the event of a compulsory restriction of importation, over and above that which she would enjoy on a strictly statistical basis,   This concession, however,  is dependent on other supplying countries boing . ready   to waive any claim to a compensatory increase of their own quotas.6.    In addition to the above there is the advantage which will result from any settlement of the Riga Loan question. United Kinp-doin residents are largely interested in this loan which was floated by Lazard Brothers before the war.   No payments in respect of interest or sinking fund have been made since 1917 and the amount outstanding is now .Z2,140,000, the original issue having been for . 1,322,740,   Whilst settlement of the Loan is not to be mentioned in the agreement, the
the Latvian Government have been Informed that ratification of the agreement will not take place until a satisfactory settlement has been reached.7.    I am satisfied that the conclusion of an Agreement with Latvia on the lines indicated above will be of appreciable advantage and will not have undesirable repercussions in other directions.    I therefore ask my colleagues to approve the conclusion with Latvia of such an Agreement.WAR.Board of Trade,23rd March,  1934.
ANKEX.ANGLO-IATVTAN COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS.Estimate of one Value of the Concessions likely to^ &quot;be, embodied in the Agreement.(The figures quoted are from the Latvian Returns, unless otherwise stated.     At present rate of exchange 51 is quoted at 15-17 fats,  i.e. 15 is the buying and 17 the selling rate).1.    The following estimate is based on the anticipatedincreases in trade over that of the year 1933.     United kingdom exports to Latvia in 1933 showed a very substantial improvementover those of 1938, but it is quite fair to compare theestimated results of the Trade Agreement with 1932 figuressince (1) during 1933 Latvia was making every effort to importmore goods from the United Kingdom with a view to promoting a successful Trade Agreement, and (2) one of the items of theAgreement will he the substitution of 1933 for 1932 as the basic year for Latvian import restrictions.The figures are as follows:-Latvian Imports from United Kingdom.1932................    11.7 million fats.1933................    20.0      &quot; &quot;It will be seen that the increase is one of 8.3 millionlats,  or an increase of 71 per cent, on the 1932 figures.2.     The situation as regards particular sections of the trademay he set out as followsj- .ted (a) Purchase ^greoaent Goods,se (innd lsta) The goods concerned and possible results are-500       Iron and steel.    (No figures yet agreed;    conjectural figure in margin) . Jute cloth and/or wrappers.    (Value small) Salt and salt petre.    (Value vary small). Commercial motor vehicles.

mated increase thousand fats.)(b) Herrings.l OurrequeEtsc Imports from the United Kingdom in 1932 amounted to2,450     3,817 tons, valued at 842,800 latse      The TemporaryAgreement provided that imports from the United Kingdom would not &quot;be restricted unless they reached 10,000 tons, and we have asked for an Increase of this figure to 15,000 tonse     The increased values corresponding to these quantities are as indicated in the margin.      It may he noted, however,  that the Latvian Minister has recently given a message from the Delegation that they propose to ask for a reduction of our request to 10,000 tons.(c) Textiles.125 (i) Cotton Cloth.    This is still under discussion.1,41090     The Latvian offer amounts to 260 tons, and our modifiedrequest is for 310 tons.      The Latvian offer is subjectto a sub-division into various classes, and under onehead they are offering us a little less than cur actual19 32 trade.      The position under the three headings is indicated in the margin.- (ii) Woollen cloth.    This is also still underW year/&quot;&quot; discussion.      The Latvian offer is a total of 15 tons420for the first year,  to he increased to 25 tons in the second year.     We have asked for 30 tons in the first year.      In this case the estimate of the value must he very problematical in view of the very considerable variations in price both between the classes and within each class.     The figures taken have been based on the average values of our past imports, and are as indicated in the margin.
estimated increase thousand fats. ) Our Request. 360 1,300rian fer.--00In addition, Latvia has made offers as regards wooltops and yarns which would increase our trade asindicated.(d) Ooal and coke.1,400 Latvia has offered a guarantee of 70 per cent, ofLatvian imports of coal, with a private undertaking toissue licences if requested up to 85 per cent *    She hasal3o offered a guaranteed minimum tonnage in a secretagreement, but no figure has yet been suggested on either side.   Actual United Kingdom Imports in 193 2 amounted to238,000 tons, of a value of approximately 3 million, latstotal imports being 370,000 tons, value 5.2 million fats.The estimate is complicated by the fact that our priceappears to have been   substantially lower than that of the(including   rest of Latvian imports.    It is assumed, however, that iiase agree-ja) with a guarantee our exporters will be able to get prices10nated iease  (in sand fats)ian     Our er.    Request.8,405equivalent to the Polish and German prices, and will supply 85 per cent, of Latvian imports;    values for 1934 have therefore been taken as a proportion of the value of total imports in 1932. (e) Miscellaneous Goods.These are affected by (l) the incidence of the import restriction system, and (2) the effect of tariff reductions As regards import restrictions, we cannot count on anything better than 1933 results, though we shall endeavour to make use of the general trade balance clause to secure that while in no case shall our Imports of any particular class of goods fall below the 1933 level, in cases where past trade  justifies it better results shall be obtained. As regards tariff reductions on goods other than those covered by purchase agreements, textiles and ooal, the
total value of the trade is small, being of the order of 50,000 fats.     The tariff reductions secured vary between 20 per cent,  and 50 per cent,  so that if we assume an increase of 30 per cent, as a result of the tariff reductions it would only amount to 15,000 fats, although there are some items, e.g. gramophones and motor cycles where a return to earlier trade would mean an extra quarter or half million lets.     No improvement can be guaranteed in the case of conventionalisations but the general guarantees may secure some improvement.     It is, therefore, assumed that an increase of 10 per cent, will be secured on miscellaneous goods in general and this increase would be about 700,000 fats.(f) The following table summarises the above calculations:-Imports into Latvia from the United Kingdom.1932.                                   1933.		Estimate 1934.Million fats. 11.7 (14$ of total trade).	Million fats. 20. C (21.3^ of total trade).	Million fats. 23. 5(g) In effect the estimate is  that if a Trade Agreement on the above lines is concluded the increase in United Kingdom export and re-export trade to Latvia (converting at 17 fats to the  ,) v/ill be approximately; -5700,000 over 1932 200,000 over 1933. (These figures are based on the assumption that the minimum herring exports to Latvia provided for in the Agreement will be 15,000 tons and that that quantity is actually sent. If the figure of 10,000 tons is substituted (see (b) above)  and that quantity is actually sent the above figures would require reduction by .-,354,000 in each case.)
(h) Riga Loan.In addition to the above there is to be added the gain from the settlement of the Riga Loan dispute.      The Latvian Delegation have been informed that the Agreement will not be ratified unless a satisfactory settlement is reached.     It is impossible to give any forecast of what the settlement Mill be but the amount of the loan with outstanding interest is approximately  2,140,000, of which the greater part is said to be held by United Kingdom residents.Commercial Relations and Treaties Department,Board of Trade, 21st March,   1934,
