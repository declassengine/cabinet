1Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1934. .SECRET. copy No.CP. 82 (34).CABINET.GERMANYS ILLEGAL REARMAMENT AND ITS EFFECT on british POLICY.THE military, naval and air clauses (Part V) of the Treaty of Versailles were imposed upon Germany in order to destroy and to prevent the re-creation of the powerful force with which she had constantly threatened the peace of Europe in the years preceding the War. The achievement of this objective was itself, according to the Preamble to Part V of the Treaty, &quot; to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations.&quot;2. The principal disarmament obligations imposed upon Germany are summarised in Annex I to this memorandum.3. In July 1932 Germany officially put forward her claim to equality of rights in armaments. In discussion how this claim could be met, His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom declared on the 18th September, 1932, that they could &quot; give no countenance nor encouragement to the disregard of treaty obligations,&quot; and that &quot; the correct position under the Treaty of Versailles is that Part V is still binding and can only cease to be binding by agreement.&quot; Further, a declaration, signed on the 11th December, 1932, by the United Kingdom, French, German, Italian and United States Governments, stated that one of the principles of the Disarmament Conference should be &quot; the grant to Germany of equality of rights in a system which would provide security for all nations, and that this principle should find itself embodied in the Disarma-ment Convention.....It is clearly understood that the methods of applicationof such equality of rights will be discussed by the Conference.&quot;4. By the final withdrawal of the Inter-Allied Control Commissions in 1927 the way was clear for the beginning of the illicit rearmament of Germany. Progress was slow, especially so long as the Allied forces were in occupation of the Rhineland. But its evacuation was completed in the summer of 1930; and the replacement of Dr. Bruning in May 1932 by the reactionary Government of Von Papen put an end to the restraining influence hitherto exerted in Germany by the parties of the Left. From that moment the process of rearmament began to be systematised and accelerated; and a fresh impetus was given to it by the accession to power of the Nazi Administration in the spring of 1933.5. Annex II to this memorandum shows that in both the aeronautical and military spheres German rearmament may soon become a menace to the balance of power in Europe. German civil aviation is now the first in Europe; Germany already has in effect a fleet of 600 military aeroplanes and facilities for its very rapid expansion. She can already immediately mobilise an army three times as great as that authorised by the Treaty, and a rapid expansion of her mobilisation facilities must be expected. In such circumstances the continuance of effective demilitarisation of the Rhineland becomes problematical.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government have long been disinclined to try to secure the literal enforcement of Part V of the Treaty. They were guided, especially after the withdrawal of the Control Commissions, by the practical difficulty of securing such enforcement and by the set-back to European reconciliation which such attempts would in their opinion have involved. They considered that the disarmament clauses had achieved their main object, i.e., the reduction of 7324   [9814] b
Germany to such a condition of military impotence as to render her incapable of waging an aggressive war against her neighbours within a measurable period of time. Indeed, until the beginning of 1932, it seemed legitimate to hope that the forces of the Left in Germany would be able to keep in check any attempt at serious rearmament. . :.7. For the last two years the illegal character and the extent of German rearmament have been overshadowed and obscured by the discussions at the Disarmament Conference. In our desire to obtain the 1&apos; general limitation of the armaments of all nations&apos;&apos; rendered possible by the terms imposed on Germany by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, we have been inclined to ignore the manner in which Part V was being infringed. We had hoped to solve the problem raised by the illegal rearmament of Germany, before it became unbearably acute, by the negotiation of a Disarmament Convention, which would cancel Part V of the Treaty and legalise some measure of German rearmament.8. Latterly this rearmament has become more and more flagrant. The danger in which the advent of the Hitler Government had placed the Disarmament Conference was generally recognised. Nevertheless, almost entirely owing to the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Conference was kept alive, although German rearmament was proceeding all the time. In August 1933 the French Government suggested its joint examination at Geneva under Article 213 of the Treaty. We refused this examination on the 27th November, on the ground that &quot; disarmament negotiations are still continuing, and .... so long as this is the case, it would be unwise to contemplate the course of arraigning Germany before the League under Article 213.&quot; It might almost be said that we had become so accustomed to German breaches of Part V of the Treaty that we were inclined to take them for granted and to regard them as inevitable. Familiarity had bred contempt, and public opinion in this country had almost forgotten the real purpose of Part V, which was to destroy and prevent the re-creation of the military power of Germany; and thus prepare the conditions in which alone general disarmament would be possible.9. At present yet another &quot;final&quot; attempt is being made to save the Disarmament Conference. The ways and means of doing this and the tactics to be used are outside the scope of this memorandum. But it is becoming increasingly clear that even if the Conference is saved, it cannot produce a universal Disarmament Convention : at most a limited Convention may emerge for. legalising Germany&apos;s illegal armaments, in return for her acceptance of certain temporary restrictions with regard to them.10. It is clear that Herr Hitler is most anxious to obtain a Convention on these lines, not in order to disarm his neighbours, but in order to obtain formal recognition of Germany&apos;s present illegal armaments. We may reasonably assume that he is anxious to do this because it will, he thinks, strengthen his position both at home and abroad. German rearmament is still insufficient to remove the fear of effective military intervention by France and especially to secure the defence of the Rhineland. The false position in which the illegal rearmament of Germany places her is in general a source of diplomatic weakness. Germany is still isolated abroad; Herr Hitler wishes to make her &apos;&apos; alliance-worthy.&apos;&apos; He probably wishes also to create abroad an impression of the peaceful nature of German foreign policy and thereby, if possible, further to divide the remnants of the war coalition. He also needs to be free of foreign complications until he has effected the constitutional and administrative reorganisation of the German Reich and the unification of German politics and thought, and until he has re-established the country&apos;s financial, economic and social position, and, in particular, developed his agricultural policy, which involves a minor social revolution through the establishment of a yeoman class in place of the present large estates.11. In these circumstances, ought we not to consider whether we are not in a position to make Germany pay for the legalisation of her rearmament? Her desire for such legalisation is an asset in our hands. Do not let us throw,it away simply because we do not recognise its value. A limitation of Germany&apos;s arma-ments over a term of years is an obvious sine qua non, but there are many other
conditions which we might demand from Germany in defence of our own interests, in so far as they are now threatened by German rearmament. Above all, we need not and should not proceed on the assumption that Hitler is doing us a favour by more or less accepting our proposals, and that special inducements must be offered to make the idea of a Convention palatable to him. On the other hand, it is essential to Hitler that any Convention he signs should provide for immediate German rearmament in every sphere; he cannot agree to any postponement. Like-wise, the temporary limitations, both qualitative and quantitative, to which Germany would have to submit must be wide enough to allow at once for all the illegal armaments which Germany already possesses or is in process of creating. Only if these conditions are met will Hitler obtain the legalisation which he requires. But if he does obtain it, there is a good hope that for the duration of the Convention he will observe whatever else in it he puts his signature to, and that there would be little danger, therefore, of our being called upon to take measures to compel Germany to observe its terms.12. Now the. very reasons which make Germany anxious to legalise her illegal armaments will render France averse from doing so. Even though she recognises her treaty right to be a blunted weapon, France will find it useful to brandish whenever she meets Germany. It will constitute an invaluable political grievance which she will exploit on every occasion to our embarrassment as much as to that of Germany. If, therefore, we want a Convention we must make it worth the French while to agree to one. This means and we cannot burke the issue that France must be given more security. To judge from the way things are moving it is unlikely that France will now be satisfied (she might have been some time ago) with a vague system of collective &apos;&apos; guarantees for the execution of the Convention.&quot; It looks as though in return for her signature to a Convention she will now require for her security some tangible pledge of direct British support and collaboration.13. This brings us to the question whether in these circumstances it is worth while to struggle for a Convention when it has become clear that the best Convention we can obtain will fall so far short of any of the schemes of universal disarmament with which the Conference opened. But even a Convention which in effect did nothing more than legalise and (for the period of the Convention) limit Germany&apos;s armaments would be worth having, not only because of the limitations which it would set to Germany&apos;s armaments, but also because it would dispose once and for all of the problem of what is to be done with Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. If a breakdown of the Disarmament Conference results in general and uncontrolled rearmament, the question of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles will at once obtrude itself into every diplomatic negotiation in which France and Germany are involved. Part V is, for practical purposes, dead, and it would become a putrefying corpse which, if left unburied, would soon poison the political atmosphere-phere of all Europe. Moreover, if there is to be a funeral, it is clearly better to arrange it while Hitler is still in a mood to pay the undertakers for their services. For these reasons an early Convention for legalising Germany&apos;s illegal armaments is certainly to be desired, (&apos;) and it would be worth while making certain sacrifices in order to obtain France&apos;s consent thereto. But the only basis on which such a Convention could be satisfactorily negotiated would be on the basis that Germany started by being in the wrong; that Germany was the petitioner; and that the signatories of the Treaty of Versailles had a serious and long-standing grievance against Germany, on account of her flagrant violation of her treaty obligations.14. That we have a real grievance against Germany is shown by the fact that now, even if we obtain a Convention for limiting Germany&apos;s armaments, it is generally recognised that vital British interests will require a certain rearmament on our part in order to defend them against the threat of Germany&apos;s growing mili-tary and aeronautical strength. In fact, in future, when we speak of &quot; security,&quot; we no longer have in mind French security, but British security. . Are the two(*) A diplomatic precedent is to be found in the armament by Russia in 1870 of the Black Sea ports and her establishment of- a Black Sea fleet in defiance of the Treaty of Paris of 1856. This illegal action by Russia \yas (to save the principle of. the sanctity of treaties) legalised by the Powers in February 1871.V [9814] ;   -V^r^v.&apos;-Xi - jJiWft -- &apos;    -;&apos; &apos; B 2
things the same? Can we better achieve British security in political isolation and free both from foreign commitments and from foreign collaboration? Or will British vital interests be better secured by treating British and French security as part of one and the same thing, and shaping our policy accordingly?15. This involves a major political issue beyond the scope of this memorandum, but assuming for the purposes of the present discussion the adoption of the second alternative, two things at once become evident: (1) If it is decided that British security can best be achieved in a system of Anglo-French co-operation, then it ought to be easy, within the framework of such co-operation, to give France those additional guarantees for the execution of the proposed Convention, which she asks for as the price of her signature. But in that case we should be well advised to make our offer soon before the international position has still further deteriorated, and before the chances of regulating Germany&apos;s rearmament finally vanish.(2) On the other hand, collective guarantees for the execution of an Armament Convention might by themselves appear inadequate when viewed from the point of view of British security. Moreover, if for one reason or another the contemplated Convention did not materialise, they would, of course, disappear with it, and would have to be replaced by some bilateral agreement between France and Great Britain. In fact, when we speak of achieving British security by treating British and French security as part of one and the same thing, we may be forced to the conclusion that nothing less than a definite mutual promise of support, involving a precise military commitment, will suffice if, as we must assume, our object is that the strength of France should to some degree be a substitute for our own strength, and that the pooling of our joint resources should add to our own efficiency while reducing-the strain on our finances and man power.16. Events are moving fast, and the time for saving something from the wreckage of the Disarmament Conference is growing short. Circumstances have altered, and we are now faced with a tacit repudiation by Germany of the limits set to her armaments by the Peace Treaty, which has become flagrant and may soon become dangerous. It is therefore highly desirable that an early decision should be reached on the question of policy raised in paragraph 14. It is submitted that the old question of French security must now be viewed, not merely as hitherto in its generalised form as part of an international Convention on Armaments, but in its more concrete form as an ingredient in the future organisa-tion of British security against the impending menace created by Germany&apos;s uncontrolled rearmament.J.

Germany to give facilities for any investigation into the state of her armaments decided on by the Council of the League.ANNEX II.Present Position of German Rearmament.The following paragraphs review the present state of German rearmament and the possibilities of its development: (1) Aviation.1. Last summer the position, generally speaking, was that a mass of secret infoimiation and some public reports indicated the naanu-facture and use of prohibited aircraft and war material; a civil aviation organisation and air training facilities considerably in excess of normal development; the granting of illegal subsidies for aviation on a considerable scale; the intimate connexion of the German Ministry of Defence with the development of German aviation, and the illegal training in aviation on a considerable scale of military and naval personnel, both in Germany and in Russia. The Air Ministry estimated the strength of the high-power aircraft in existence and under construction in Germany and suitable for military purposes at 127.2. The air section of the Berlin annual report for 1933 states that the past year has seen far-reaching changes in German aviation. German air transport now occupies the first position in Europe and the second in the world. The establishment of an air commissariat under Goring at the beginning of 1933 was followed a few months later by its replacement by an Air Ministry of considerable proportions. It has become increasingly difficult to obtain information respecting air development in Germany; there is reason to believe that the German Air Ministry is organised on similar lines to our own; whilst in place of the active service personnel in other countries  Germany has an
Air Sport Association, whose members wear blue-grey uniforms. This associa fcion ^embraces everybody and every organisation concerned with flying, and it is under the protection of the State, like the S.A., and is an integral part of the National Socialist party. (N.B. The Air Ministry estimate that during 1933 approximately 500 new pilots completed their training course under the Air Sport; Association and they expect that this figure will be doubled in 1934.) Military and naval officers are, as far as possible, required to take up flying courses. We have unimpeachable evidence (derived from material obtained as a result of the crash of a German police aeroplane) in Czechoslovakia, that the German police are required to do the same. The German aircraft industry has orders for some time ahead; but the performances of the service aircraft, which it has so far produced, do not seem to have been very satisfactory,&apos; so for some time to come the Government will have to look abroad for equipment of this new air force. (N.B.-The Air Ministry&apos;s view is that, though the performances of these aircraft have until lately hardly been up to the performance of our own latest types, they are, in the near future, likely to equal them.)3. .0n the 15th February the Air Ministry estimated the strength of German aircraft of a military type in existence or under construction at the beginning of February 1934 at 338, as compared with 127 a year earlier. In addition, the Air Ministry state that there are in Germany 1,349 civil aeroplanes registered, of which 250 are capable of immediate military use. The Air Ministry have reason to believe that the present rate of output is about sixty complete aircraft a month, which could be expanded within six months to over ten times that amount. A report, as yet unconfirmed, states that 300 three-engined aircraft have been ordered by the German Air Ministry.4. In summarising the changes in the air situation of Germany during the past year, our Air Attache in Berlin states that &quot; it is no exaggeration to describe them as fundamental; every section of aviation has become a hive of energy, something very like a war spirit appears to have found its way into all things in any way connected with the air, and all changes are now carried out and new schemes started without a whisper of criticism. There is no doubt that the year has brought a remarkable accession of strength to Germany&apos;s potential air power, the moral of all those connected with the air has improved out of all recognition, the aeronautical industry&apos;s production has increased substantially, and a certain purposefulness is now evident that was formerly lacking.&quot;(This Section has been contributed by the War Office.)(2) Military.In November 1933 the state of German pi&apos;eparations for rearmament was reviewed in a memorandum printed as Appendix I to the report of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the &quot;German Rearmaments Proposals&quot; (C.I.D. Paper D.C. (M) (32)-61). The further information received since that paper was written tends to confirm the statements which it contained and is summarised below.It must be emphasised that the following notes take into account only the development of the German Army, apart from naval and air forces, and that, to this extent, the picture which they present is incomplete.1. There appears to be little doubt that, during Germany&apos;s period of military weakness, the Reichswehrministerium has been genuinely afraid of aggression by Poland in the form of &quot; preventive war,&quot; and possibly, to a less degree of the application by France of &quot;military sanctions.&quot; To meet these dangers there has long been in existence an irregular Grenzschutz, or Frontier Defence Force, on the Polish frontier, especially in East Prussia. Frontier Defence organisations, chiefly of police, have been organised in the Rhineland, and a scheme has been in existence for the expansion of the Regular Army on mobilisation to 21 infantry divisions. To supply these forces with munitions the Reichswehrministerium has secretly expended money on the provision of armaments, beyond the scale authorised under the Treaty, and on the preparation of industry for mobilisation;
2. The advent of the Hitler regime, which has placed at the disposal of the German military authorities the whole of the resources in personnel represented by the militant Nazi organisations, as well as large funds provided under the scheme for providing work for the unemployed (&quot; Arbeitsbeschaffungsprogramm &quot;), has at the same time increased, as it must seem to the Reichswehrministerium, the danger of foreign intervention. Reports tend to show that the German military authorities are still oppressed by a feeling of insecurity, but as time passes and the danger of &apos;&apos; military sanctions &apos;&apos; and of &apos;&apos; preventive &apos;&apos; war becomes less menacing, Germany may grow bolder in her proposals for rearmament and accelerate her defensive preparations.3. The Reich Government has recently proposed for Germany an army of 300,000 men with the normal proportion of the weapons regarded as &quot; defensive.&quot; Recent information shows that 200,000 selected S.S. and S.A. personnel have been or are being trained for periods of three months under the Regular Army, while the numbers of officer cadets are reported to have been increased. The training of junior Nazi leaders as both active and reserve officers is also in active progress. It seems probable, therefore, that Germany is now or will shortly be in a position to expand the Regular Army of 100,000 to the proposed peace establishment of 300,000 by the addition at the shortest notice of trained personnel. The German military authorities will thus avoid the reorganisation of the Reichswehr by stages which France desires but which German military opinion regards as especially dangerous. There is little doubt that the necessary weapons for this increased peace establishment already exist.4. Parallel with the training of the personnel selected for the expansion of -the peace establishment of the army, training on a lower scale, with Reichswehr and possibly with police assistance of a further 500,000 selected youths is reported to be in progress, while the remainder of the younger personnel of the Nazi forces, the numbers of which it is difficult to estimate, are being organised into categories of reservists and are receiving pre-military training under their own leaders. To the sources of military reinforcements, available on mobilisation, the Labour Service Camps, the Hitler Jugend and other organisations are adding their quota.5. The latest reports seem to indicate that, were mobilisation to be ordered at the present date, the German Army would mobilise 3 or 4 cavalry divisions. 21 infantry divisions.33 Grenzschutz Groups (equivalent to strong mixed brigades) on the. Polish and Czechoslovakian frontiers. 11 Police Defence Regiments in the Rhineland.Of these, the cavalry and infantry divisions would be complete with field artillery, but still on a low scale and greatly deficient in the very important medium artillery. The supply of artillery ammunition would probably still be insufficient for prolonged intensive fighting, and tanks are only now reported to be coming into production in any numbers. The Frontier Defence Organisations, though equipped with rifles and machine guns, would probably possess very little artillery. Behind these forces, although semi-trained personnel would be ample, lack of material would still, it is considered, prevent the raising of further mobile formations until the fifth or sixth month after mobilisation.While the French military authorities appear to regard these forces, as a serious menace, the War Office believe that the Reichswehrministerium still consider them to be insufficient to prevent the occupation of the Rhineland by France, and still less adequate to conduct a war on two fronts against France and Poland.6. Apart from the quantity and cost of the material involved, the creation of large armies sufficiently organised and trained to ensure victory in offensive operations against civilised opponents is not the work of a few months. The preparation of the officer cadres alone presents a definite limitation. The German General Staff, moreover, are not likely again to endanger their country without a sufficient probability of success.There seems no reason, therefore, at present, to.modify the conclusion reached in November last that the German Army will require several years before it can, be fit to initiate a new war.   It is even possible that the 10 years&apos; period of the
treaty with Poland may indicate the breathing space which the Reichswehr-ministerium consider to be necessary. Should the German military authorities aim at an earlier date of readiness, it is considered that the preparations which such a programme would necessitate can hardly be disguised, and that it should then be possible to form an estimate of the progress of Germany&apos;s rearmament.(3) Naval.1, In a recent despatch from Berlin Sir E. Phipps reported that he had no reason to suppose that the naval clauses of the Treaty of Versailles were being infringed to any notable extent. The Admiralty confirm this statement. In a memorandum communicated to the British Naval Attache at Berlin on the 29th November, 1933, the Head of the Marineleitung stated : &quot; There is no place in Germany to-day for aspirations of the Tirpitz era.&quot; The object of, and the necessity for, the German Navy has, according to Admiral Raeder, been repeatedly and very accurately described by Sir H. Russell (the War correspondent and novelist), &quot; who stated that a German fleet developed within certain limits is an instrument for the maintenance of peace, particularly in the Baltic; and that such a fleet is also especially necessary for holding the Soviet fleet in check. The further development of the fleet would take place entirely in agreement with British policy after a new London-Washington Conference has been held in 1935-36. At this Conference of the Great Powers, Germany will naturally demand equality of treatment. In practice, however, this equality will only be &apos; qualitative,&apos; and it would be laughable to suppose that Germany wanted anything approaching &apos; quantitative &apos; equality with the naval forces of Great Britain.    ...&quot;2. Sir E. Phipps&apos;s annual report on Germany for 1933, Section VI, states that &quot; the general focussing of public interest on military, air and naval matters has done much to restore Germany&apos;s old pride in her navy, and the withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference has doubtless encouraged many to hope for an early removal of the limitations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles &apos;&apos;; and, again, that &quot; every opportunity has been taken in the daily and weekly press, in various technical and semi-official monthly journals, and by means of broadcasting, public lectures and exhibitions, to reawaken public interest in naval matters, and to compare Germany&apos;s naval strength with that of the other Powers. Germany&apos;s lack of submarines and aircraft is made the most of, and the &quot;injustice &apos; of the treaty is emphasised in every possible way.&quot;o
