Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.SECRET. Copy No.   36CP. Ill (34).CABINET.THE KENYA LAND COMMISSION REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I AM circulating with this memorandum the Report of the Kenya Land Commission, on which I must make an early pronouncement.1. The Cabinet will remember that I appointed the Commission on the recommendation of the Joint Select Committee. The Commission^ terms of reference are set out on page 1 of the Report.   The Commission were directed : (a) To consider the present and prospective needs of the native population with regard to land and the desirability and practicability of setting aside further land for native use.(6) To determine native claims with regard to land, whether alienated or not, and to make recommendations for their fair settlement.(c) To consider and make recommendations with regard to native rights under the Crown Lands Ordinance.(d) To define the (European) Highlands.(e) To review the working of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance, and torecommend how the administrative difficulties thereunder can best be met.2. The Report is one of the most careful and thorough pieces of work I have, ever seen. We were very fortunate in the personnel of the Commission. Sir Morris Carter was an ideal Chairman. To his legal experience as Chief Justice of Uganda and later of Tanganyika he added special experience gained in presiding over a similar land enqui^ in Southern Rhodesia. He was equally fortunate in his colleagues. Mr. Hemsted had been a successful Provincial Commissioner in Kenya, and Captain Wilson is well known there as a practical farmer and a model employer.3. The thoroughness with which the Commission conducted their enquiry may be gauged by the fact that they examined 736 witnesses, 487 of whom were natives, and received and considered over 500 memoranda. Most of the native evidence was taken in public assemblies, and the Commission always asked the assembled natives, before the end of the baraza, whether they agreed with the statements made. They were thus able to judge to what extent the opinions expressed were representative of the general feeling of the tribe. The Report is characterised not only by the thoroughness with which they investigated every claim and the economic requirements of every tribe, but also by a remarkable insight into native mentality.4. I will summarise, as shortly as I can, the main findings and recommen-dations of the Commission.I have discussed the Report with the Governor and his senior officers, and with the two Kenya members of the Commission. With the exception of the suggestion that the Land Trust Board should be in the United Kingdom, with which I deal later, the Governor and I are in general agreement with all the recommendations.5.   Parts I and II of the Report, covering over 340 pages, contain an exhaustive review of all the claims, legal, equitable, and historical, of every native tribe, and of their economic conditions and requirements, present and prospective. [9853] b
Every claim, however remote or far-fetched, was carefully examined; and additions of land, amounting in all to 1,902 square miles, are recommended in satisfaction of native claims asserted over land not noAv included in the Reserves. Further additions, totalling 1,155 square miles, are recommended to meet the present and future economic requirements of various tribes. Further areas, amounting to 939 square miles, are recommended for the exclusive use of natives, but are not allocated to any particular tribe.The Commission have been careful to consider the prospective needs, not only of natives living within the Reserves, but of natives now living outside the Reserves who may return.A further addition of 1,500 acres to the Kavirondo Reserve is recommended to compensate for any surface land excluded from the Reserve for mining leases in the near future, though the Commission recommend an alternative system for mining leases, to which I shall refer later, and which the Commission think will be both more convenient and more popular.6. The Commission differentiate between land to be added to the Reserves to meet claims made as of right, and land which is to be added to satisfy the economic requirements of the natives. The former (Class A lands) they recommend should be added unconditionally. The latter is to be subject to conditions of economic user, and is further divided into three classes : Class B (I). Land added to meet a permanent need.Class B (II). Land added to fulfil a need which appears to be of a moretemporary character. Class C. Land to be set apart for alienation on lease to natives, whether as groups, families or individuals.The recommendation that land added on economic grounds should be subject to special conditions is a very wise provision, having regard to the vital importance of encouraging better methods of agriculture, particularly in over-stocked areas.7. The Commission recommend that a number of exchanges of land should be carried out in order to make the boundaries of the Reserves more convenient. These recommendations appear to be sound, but the Governor wishes to go into them in detail with the Chief Native Commissioner and the local officers before finally approving of them.8. The Commission further recommend that a number of Reserves should he amalgamated. Their general argument is, I think, conclusive. Separate Reserves have been gazetted in the past for tribes which are closely related; and there is a gradual tendency to inter-penetration, which is greatly to be encouraged, as it is very desirable that there should be a natural and spontaneous movement from the more densely to the less densely populated areas. Not only are tribal divisions tending in some cases to become blurred, but as agricultural practice improves, individual, family and group ownership is developing satisfactorily.While the general principle of amalgamating like with like is clearly sound, the Governor has reasonably asked that he may have more time to consider the details of the proposals.9. The additions recommended are equitable, and, I think, generous to the natives. Certain of the recommendations which give to natives land claimed as European Highlands may be adversely criticised by settlers, but I am sure that they should be supported, and that the additions recommended by the Commission should be accepted in their entirety..1.0. The Commission have defined the boundaries of the European Highlands.11: The Commission recommend that the boundaries of the Reserves and of the Class C lands (native leasehold areas), and of the Highlands, should be declared by an Order in Council. This will give an added sense of security, in that these&apos; boundaries cannot be altered by local Ordinance.. 12. The Commission make a special recommendation about the Northern Frontier and Turkana Districts; large, sparsely populated areas, inhabited by nOmadic tribes, which Observe no fixed- boundaries. They recommend that no part of these territories should be gazetted as. native Reserves, but that the
territories should be recognised as land in which natives have a prior interest, and leases to non-natives should not be allowed to such an extent as to justify the apprehension that the natives might not have sufficient land remaining for their use; and they recommend that the priority of native interests should be safeguarded by a special section under the Lands Trust Ordinance.13. The legal position under the Crown Lands Ordinances is obscure, and might give rise to claims in future if not finally disposed of. The whole position is fully discussed in Part III, Chapter 7. If, as is proposed, the large additions of land recommended are made to the Reserves in settlement of all claims which the Commission consider can in any way be established in regard to past alienations, and if cash compensation is made to certain Kikuyu still living on farms (paragraph 1835), and if the provisos recommended in paragraph 1854 are observed, all legitimate native claims will have been fully satisfied. Once these claims are so satisfied, it is essential that the Order in Council should declare that these provisions constitute a final settlement, and that the sections of the Crown Lands Ordinances, 1902 and 1915, which may or may not create uncertain and unknown rights, should be declared inoperative.14. Having disposed of native claims and economic requirements, by the additions of land referred to above, and having determined the boundaries of the Highlands, the Commission recommend that all other lands (Class D) shall be treated as areas in which natives will have equal rights with other races in respect of the acquisition of land.15. Following on their detailed accounts of the conditions obtaining in the various Reserves, the Commission, in Part III, Chapter 10, face up to the grave problem of over-stocking. Everyone who knows Kenya is familiar with the problem. In 1929 Sir Daniel Halhs Agricultural Commission stressed the gravity and urgency of this problem. Writing of the Ukamba, that Commission observed : &quot;It is not too much to say that a desert has already been created where grazing formerly was good, and where even cultivation existed; and that the same desert conditions are steadily approaching the land at present carrying stock and cultivation.&quot; And again : &quot; It is necessary to take in hand at once the reduction in the numbers of livestock kept by the natives. Though the ultimate solution can only be obtained by the education of the native to treat his livestock as a means of producing food, it will in some cases be necessary to apply immediate compulsion to get the natives to part with the stock that are in excess of what the land will carry.&quot;16. The situation bristles with difficulties. Cattle are currency, and a very debased currency. A bad cow has the same value as a good cow, and 10 (?) goats equal 1 cow. Greshanis Law has worked immutably, and bad stock have driven out the good. And this debased currency is valid for one purpose only  the purchase of wives. Meat is but little eaten by the tribes who are the worst offenders. There is no market for bad stock, even if the natives were prepared to sell; and there is a complicated trust ownership in cattle which makes it impossible for a man to sell a cow even if he could, without a wide family council. Government has aggravated and, indeed, largely created the problem by its good intentions. The Veterinary Service has stopped the spread of disease; and it cannot suspend this work without serious danger to valuable European herds.Government has tried to educate the natives in better husbandry, but these efforts have been largely ineffective in the backward tribes, where the evil is most persistent. Hitherto Government has shied at the only effective way of dealing wuth the problem.17. The Commission are insistent on the seriousness of the evil and the need for immediate action. &quot;It is definitely not a problem which can be solved by an increase of land. If the uncontrolled increase of stock be permitted to continue, then the whole of Africa would be insufficient to satisfy the wants of the future.&quot;&quot; We have heard in evidence that 20 years ago the Kamasia Reserve was still a well-grassed country, and the Suk were moving their grazing areas every year with a view to controlling the grass.....Conditions in the KambaReserve and in the drier parts of the Masai Reserve were still tolerable. Now,, in many parts where there used to be grass, there is nothing but bare earth.&quot;[9853] B 2
We therefore recommend, with all the emphasis at our command, that action be taken with the least possible delay to inaugurate the culling of surplus stock and to pursue unremittingly a policy of controlling the cattle population within the limits which the grazing facilities available from time to time dictate.We should make no such recommendation if we were not satisfied that, in spite of all the difficulties, such a course is practicable. This opinion is already shared by several of the senior administrative officers upon whom will fall the burden of seeing that the task is carried out.&quot;18. The Commission accordingly recommend that the principle of compulsion in reducing the numbers of stock in areas now being devastated by over-stocking be accepted, and that the provisions of the Crop Production and Livestock Ordinance be put into force in those areas as soon as practicable. They also recommend the establishment of one or more fertiliser factories (blood and bone) to create a market for the stock. I am advised that there would be a ready sale for the fertiliser produced. They further recommend that a committee should be appointed to consider the matter in detail. The problem is one which must be faced; and the Government will go thoroughly into the practical details of carrying out the recommendations in a selected area or selected areas where the need is greatest.19. While land is being ruined by over-stocking in some Reserves, e.g., Masai, Ukamba, Kamasia, Njemps, Suk, it is satisfactory to note that the most populous tribes, like the Kikuyu and the Kavirondo, are comparatively free from this affliction, and are improving their agricultural standards.20. In Chapters 3-6 of Part III the Commission review exhaustively the working of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance and make a series of recommendations.Though their recommendations with regard to mining leases form a co-ordinated part of their general recommendations for the acquisition of plots within the Natives Reserves for public and other purposes, it will be convenient, in view of the immediate importance of the mining industry, if I deal separately with mining leases.21. I am glad to say that, before I left, I was able to pay a visit to Kakamega. I motored through part of the mining area; I visited two of the largest mining undertakings; and I flew low over a large area where prospecting is in progress. I can confirm from personal experience all the information which I have given in the House of Commons. Relations between mining companies and prospectors and the natives are excellent. Numbers of natives are employed, and are obviously well satisfied with their employment. There is very little disturbance of land; and where there is disturbance, compensation is on a generous and, indeed, a lavish scale. No native has had to move away from his area. A valuable market has been created for native produce and native timber. Roads have been greatly improved by mining companies. Most important of all, I verified the nature of the goldfield as it is being disclosed by the operations to date. To compare this area with the Rand is ridiculous. The field consists of narrow seams separated by considerable areas of intervening land. For example, Tanganyika Concessions are working two rich narrow seams 1,200 yards apart. Consequently it is highly improbable that any natives will have to move to other districts.   The areas required for surface leases will be small.22. The Cabinet will remember that the inelasticity of the existing Ordinance led to an amendment passed in 1932 providing for the exclusion of land required for surface leases. The Commission approved of this at the time as an immediate measure; but the result of their enquiry and of the native evidence which they have heard have led them to recommend an alternative method which is, in their judgment, more convenient and also likely to be much more in accord with native, sentiment and prejudice. The Commission recommend (Part III, Chapter 3) that the usual procedure for any lease in a Reserve should be by a process of &quot; setting apart&apos; and not by exclusion. The procedure would be as follows : The Provincial Commissioner would have the power to set apart land for public purposes or as a step preliminary to the issue of any lease, where he is satisfied that it will be for the benefit of the natives resident in the tribal unit concerned, either in respect of the use to which the land is to be put or because of the revenue to be expected from rents.   Before the land is set apart, the
Provincial Commissioner must consult the local natives, the Local Native Council and the Local Land Board, which it is proposed should in future consist entirely of natives under the chairmanship of the District Commissioner. In addition to this, due compensation must have been arranged. If the Local Land Board and the Provincial Commissioner are in disagreement, the matter must be referred to the Governor. If the land to be set apart is more than 10 acres, the Lands Trust Board are to have the power of veto. Where land is set apart and leased, it will remain a part of the Reserve.In paragraphs 1573-1577 the Commission give their reasons why, in their opinion, this process of setting apart as opposed to exclusion from the Reserve is more convenient, more to the advantage of the natives and more in accord with native sentiment.I propose that the Native Lands Trust Ordinance should be amended forthwith to enable mining leases to be dealt with in this way, in advance of the long and more complicated Ordinance which will be required to give effect to the other amendments recommended by the Commission.23. The close examination which the Commission have made of the working of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance shows that it is administratively inconvenient in many ways; that its inelasticity has operated to the detriment of the natives; that it ignores native private rights, which are becoming increasingly important; that it tends to cramp initiative and development; and that it involves the Board in a mass of administrative detail with which it is unsuited and unable to cope, and which is the proper function of the Government officers in the District.24. The Commission demonstrate the fundamental defect in the Ordinance, viz., the failure to differentiate between the functions of protection and administration. This distinction was clearly laid down by Sir Reginald Mant, Sir George Schuster, and Mr. Oldham in the Hilton. Young Report: &apos;&apos; The first and principal need, which may be described as the &apos; protective need,&apos; is to fix the areas to be set aside, and provide secure protection for the preservation of the beneficial rights over such areas to the natives.&apos;&apos; The second and almost equally important need, which we will call the &apos; constructive need,&apos; is to provide for the actual use of land in such a manner as will be of the greatest benefit to the natives.....&quot;It is not sufficient merely to reserve the land under the dead hand of a rigid and unalienable legal restriction, and it is a necessary consequence of these considerations that a measure which aims at preserving the beneficial use of the land to the natives must include regulations for handling it.&quot;The Commission criticise strongly the failure to observe this distinction. Of the provision requiring all matters relating to management and development to be dealt with by the Lands Trust Board, they say : &apos;&apos; The clause implies a static condition in which the initiation of development lies with the Lands Trust Board, which asks the advice of the Local Board, and, finally, authorises somebody to do something so that the reserve may be developed. We prefer to think of a dynamic condition in which natives are themselves the principal developing agents by cultivating their own crops on their own land and pursuing their lawful occasions, the Lands Trust Board being only concerned in a protective capacity. Advice or regulation required for helping the natives to develop their own land should be the active concern of Government. We agree, however, that the Lands Trust Board should make representations, if it considers that Government is neglecting its duty in this respect.&apos;&apos; Constant reference of petty matters to the Lands Trust Board has the &apos; ; triple disadvantage that it distracts the attention of the Board from more serious duties, holds up legitimate development, and introduces a creeping paralysis into the power, and, ultimately, the will of the Government to govern.&quot;25. The Commission accordingly recommend that the business of detailed management and of development should be the function of Government, and the duty of protection the function of the Board.  The areas of the Native Reserves
as enlarged and reconstituted will be secured by Order in Council. The Board will be relieved of a mass of minor administrative matters, but will have jurisdiction in all larger proposals affecting land within the reserves, e.g., exchanges of land, whether by exclusion and addition or by mutual lease; the power of veto over the setting apart or leasing of land in excess of 10 acres ;* the power to issue general or special instructions in the granting of licences;! and consultation in all major cases of water permits. The Board is, moreover, to have general power and duty of supervision, and of making representations to the Governor, and, if necessary, to the Secretary of State, if it considers that the land is not being devoted to the use and benefit of the natives, or is not being properly conserved and developed.The whole of Chapter 6, in which the detailed working of the Ordinance is reviewed, is well worth reading.I am sure the Commission are right in insisting on the distinction between the protective and administrative functions, and I propose generally to adopt their recommendations.26. I come now to the suggestion of the Commission with which both the Governor and I disagree. In paragraphs 1692-1697 the Commission recommend that the present Land Trust Board in Kenya should be abolished and superseded by a Board appointed by Order in Council. They make the tentative suggestion that the Board so constituted should sit in London, but the Cabinet will see that only one member makes this a definite recommendation. My discussions with the members of the Commission showed that they had not appreciated the difficulties and objections. If they had done so, I do not think the recommenda-tion would have been made, and I am sure they will raise no objection to the proposal being turned down.Incidentally, the recommendation was made under a misconception of the functions of the Privy Council. But apart from this, I am convinced that the proposal is unsound in principle and unworkable in practice. In principle, the ultimate authority must be the Secretary of State, responsible to Parliament. A Board responsible to the Privy Council would be an impossible innovation. In practice, I cannot see how a London board could possibly discharge its functions. I have already drawn the attention of the Cabinet to a number of these. As I have pointed out, the assent or opinion of the Board is required in all the more important administrative decisions with regard to land within the Reserves, and they have further the general power and duty to make representations to the Governor if they consider that the land is not being devoted and developed to the best advantage. These are very important functions. They can only be discharged by a body with intimate and continuing knowledge of local conditions, and by men on the spot able to discuss proposals with the responsible officers of Government and with Local Native Councils. A board in London could not possess these qualities; it would operate ineffectively and with intolerable delay. If the Board is to function effectively it must reside in Kenya.27. I think, however, there is force in the argument that the Board, as at present constituted, is over-weighted with Government representatives and members of the Legislative Council. It makes, or appears to make, the Government too much a judge in its own cause. I have suggested to the Governor that a new board should be constituted as follows : The Chief Native Commissioner, who is the Senior Officer specially charged with native interests, as Chairman; the twoi members of the Legislative Council appointed to represent native interests; two independent persons who are neither officers of Government nor members of the Legislative Council. As the Board will be relieved of a mass of trivial and unimportant work, it should be possible to secure two really able men with first-class agricultural or business experience. In this way I think criticisms of the Commission would be fairly met, and a thoroughly* Subject to the discretion of the Board to delegate to the Chief Native Commissioner the power of assenting to the setting apart of land not exceeding 100 acres and the leasing of land not exceeding 50 acres.I As regards mining licences, the Commission recommend that the Board should not have the power of veto but should be able to make representations to the Governor or the Secretary of State.I A second member is being added in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee.
competent and impartial Board would be established. The Governor has asked for further time to consider this suggestion. Unless I obtain his concurrence before making an announcement on the Report, I should propose to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not accept the proposal to establish a Board in London, for the reasons which I have given, but that the constitution of the Board in Kenya is under consideration.28. Lastly, I come to the question of finance. The recommendations of the Commission for the acquisiton of land to be added to the Reserves and for certain ancillary purposes and for compensation involve an estimated capital expenditure of  36,000, and a recurrent charge of  1,300 a year. The cost of the Commission, apart from the cost of publishing the Report, is approximately  6,000. In addition, the Government will be involved in considerable expenditure in establishing, or assisting to establish, a fertiliser factory or factories (see paragraph 18 above), and in development within the Reserves.The Commission make a very strong recommendation as to how this money should be found. In support of this recommendation, Kenya is for once united  Government, settlers, missionaries, officials, Indians and natives. I am bound to say that, in my opinion, the justice of the claim made on the Imperial Government is unanswerable. I would ask my colleagues particularly to read paragraphs 2048-2068 of the Report. The facts are not in dispute. It is not a pleasant or a creditable story. I think, on reading it, Cabinet will agree with the Commission when they conclude : &quot; We consider that if such treatment (i.e., the retention of the money owing to dead porters killed in the War) were meted out, it would constitute a much more callous violation of the principles of trusteeship to the natives than any of the injuries which the natives have suffered by the alienation of their land.&quot;(Initialled) P.

[REPORT OF THE KENYA LAND commission the Rt.-Hon. Major Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister,t.c., g.b.e., m.c., m.p.,Secretary of State for the Colonies.BiR,We, the undersigned Commissioners, fcubmit herewith our Report.have the honour toIntroduction1. We were appointed by you in April, 1932, to consider and report upon certain land problems in the Colony of Kenya. We were also appointed by His Excellency the Governor under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance, in order that we might be in a position to take evidence on oath in Kenya, our appointment being ihlished in the Official Gazette of the Colony under Government Notice No. 41S of 11th June, 1932.2. The terms of our reference are as set out here below : (1) To consider the needs of the native population, present and prospective, with respect to land, whether to be held on tribal or on individual tenure.(2) To consider the desirability and practicability of set-ting aside further areas of land for the present or future occupancy of (a) communities, bodies or individual natives of recognized tribes; and(b) detribalized natives, that is, natives who belong to no tribe or who have severed connexion with the tribe to which they once belonged.(3) To determine the nature and extent of claims asserted by natives over land alienated to non-natives and to make recommendations for the adequate settlement of such claims whether by legislation or otherwise.Appointment and Terms of Reference.
INTRODUCTION(4) To examine claims asserted by natives over hind yet alienated and to make recommendations for the adequ settlement of such claims.(o) To consider the nature and extent of the rights I by natives under section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordina (Chapter 140 of the Revised Edition), and whether bet means could be adopted for dealing with such rights in reap of-(a) land already alienated; and(b) land alienated in the future.(6) To define the area, generally known as the highlam within which persons of European descent are to have privileged position in accordance with the White Paper 1923. .(7) To review the working of the Native Lands Tn Ordinance, 1930, and to consider how any administrate difficulties that may already have arisen can best be n whether by supplemental legislation or otherwise with; involving any departure from the principles of the s; Ordinance.Places at which 3. In order that we might have the advantage of receiving! heard&quot;06 testimony of retired civil servants and other persons now reside&apos;in England, whose experience of Kenya is of long standing, it w arranged, with the concurrence of the other Commissioners, tl the Chairman should hear evidence in London before embarki for Kenya.  This evidence was taken by him in June, 1932.4. We assembled in Nairobi on 2nd August, 1932, and spt the next three-and-a-half months in visiting the provinces in tin This was done with the double purpose of enabling witnesses re dent in the provinces to appear before us without the inconvenien of coming to Nairobi, and also of affording us an opportunity studying some of the local problems on the spot. Announcemet in the Official Gazette and in local newspapers gave to the pub! notification of our sessions at various centres and of our desire obtain evidence. The number of places at which we sat to lie evidence in the course of our tour was forty-two.5. From the 23rd November until the end of February i were principally employed in hearing evidence from natives ai non-natives in Nairobi, but during this period we also visited t! Coast Province, the Leroki Plateau, and various parts of Kikuj The month of March was spent principally in hearing the eviilen of Heads of Government Departments, and the ensuing tin months were devoted to the preparation of the report and in taki supplementary evidence.
INTRODUCTION(i. Altogether 736 witnesses have been heard and 507 mem or- The number agenda have been presented.   It may be of interest to record that 487 ^nfSd. f the witnesses examined have been natives and the remainder on-natives.   Of the latter 94 were Government officials.Not included in the above list are 212 statements which have een recorded by magistrates and forwarded to us. The great lajprity of these statements are by natives.There have also been some 400 letters or other documents received from Kikuyu natives, dealing with private claims by amilies or groups.It will therefore be apparent that there has been no lack of aterial on which to work.7. Most of the native evidence was taken in baruzas or public ssemblies, and it has always been our practice. to ask the as-embled natives before the end of the baraza whether they agree itb the statements made. In this way we have been able to judge o what extent the opinions expressed are representative of the eneral feeling of the tribe.8. In all cases the recorded statements of witnesses and the emoranda submitted by them  (or accurate copies) have been need on the original record of evidence.  In most cases they also appear in the printed version, exceptions being occasionally made or the following reasons : (a) If the memorandum is a printed document available to be read elsewhere.(li) If the memorandum is, in our judgment, too voluminous to be printed, regard being had to its value in connexion with our inquiry.(c) If the witness Iras desired that the evidence be not pub-lisheci, on the ground that its publication would be against the public policy or interest.(d) In the case of the Secretary&apos;s precis, prepared before the arrival of the Commission, only a summary has been printed, because the original contains extracts from pro-ceedings in the Executive Council and other confidential matter, which could not be published without reference to the Secretary of State.9. A further exception has been made in the case of claims I) Kikuyu families or groups. These, taken collectively, are far Ipo voluminous to be printed. But we have authorized the pub-Jeation of a summary which appears at pp. 25S to 375 of-the tinted evidence.
INTRODUCTION10. The evidence of all witnesses who have appeared before1 the Commission in Kenya has been taken on oath or affirmation, but the evidence taken in London was not, since the Chains-had no authority to administer oaths in England. It has been on. practice to send the record of his evidence to each witness for cot-rection, and in the case of native witnesses the record has bea sent to the District Commissioner to be checked over by him wit] the natives and any necessary corrections have been made.11. We have also taken cognizance of memoranda submitte! by persons who have not been able to appear before us, ever though such memoranda have not in all cases been affirmed r,t oath; and we have availed ourselves of material contained i; Government files, printed hooks, maps and other documents. 0m own experience of the Colony is considerable, and we have regards, it as legitimate, and indeed inevitable, that we should use it ass background against which to test the rival merits of conflict:!:, statements and claims. A principle    ^        12. After reaching our conclusions on the evidence, we !ia\ Recommend a-&quot; endeavoured to make recommendations which offer a practical soli tioiio. tion of the various problems in the light of facts as they existo-day.Arrangement 18. The report is divided into three parts.   The first part0    6 devoted to the Kikuyu Province; the second to the other province:and in the third part we attempt a review of the native land from lems as a whole. A chapter on the definition of the Highland is also included in this part.14. The above arrangement, which sets the Kikuyu Provim in one part and all the other provinces in another part, may sng^ft that we attach more importance to the needs of the Kikuyu i respect of land than to the needs of other tribes. This is not tli case, but the exceptional degree of individualism to which tlii tribe has attained in its conceptions of landholding&quot;, in conjunct!! with other considerations which we shall explain, have renderedtli just settlement of the Kikuyu land problems especially intricate and have demanded examination in greater detail than has bee necessary for other tribes.15. Tn our examination of provinces we have for the inn-part adopted an arrangement by which we review separately tl claims asserted on historical grounds and those winch rest o grounds of present or future needs. In reaching our conclusion regarding the several tribes we have, in each case, taken in: account the state of advancement of the tribe, its agricultural ai pastoral practice and system of land tenure.   Tn order that t!
300INTRODUCTIONreasons for our recommendations may be appreciated we have in-cluded a short description of the economic condition of each tribe in these respects. We also include sections dealing with exchanges, djiistments, and special cases.16. In the comprehensive survey in the final part of our Beport we enlarge the scope of our inquiry and consider how the tribal lands may best be safeguarded in the interest of the occupant tribes; how they may be conserved against misuse; how they may je extended if need should arise; how protection may best be given to the private rights of individuals, families, or groups; and, finally, what provision should be made for natives who have emerged from a tribal state and wish to hold land on some more dividual form of tenure than is possible to them in the reserves.17. A small point has to be mentioned in regard to the spell- -egypt^&apos;lngjj0f ing of native names. There are some names which are commonly v mes&quot; pelt in a variety of different ways: e.g., Limuru, Limoru, and Lamuin : Kiambu and Kyambu ; Dagoretti and Dagoreti. In these cases we have adopted a uniform spelling, even when quoting from memoranda of witnesses who may have spelt the word in a different way. The same consideration applies to native names stated in the plural, and we find variously the Akamba, the Wakamba, the Awakamba and the Kamba. In these cases we have followed the practice of giving the root word simply : the Kamba, the Dorobo, She Masai, etc., but we have made an exception in the case of the word githaka, where we show githaka in the singular and ithaka a the plural. There are a few cases where a wrong spelling has [become hallowed by usage, e.g., Kapiti, which derives its name rom the Kaputiei section of the Masai. We use the first spelling [in reference to the place and the latter in reference to the people. [These small points ought, perhaps, to be mentioned.18. We have been greatly assisted in our task by the readiness Acknowlcdg-fwith which witnesses of all races have come forward to give men &quot; vidence, and the careful memoranda which have been submitted by members of the joublic and by Government departments.   We e also most grateful for the help which has been afforded us J)y the officers of the Land and Survey Departments who have een indefatigable in supplying all the information for which we Bfiave asked.  In this connexion we expressly desire to mention Mr. 3. E. Mortimer, of the Land Department, and Mr. E. J. Gosden nd Mr. C. G. Pannin, of the Survey Department.  We are also lost grateful to the Suvve3?or General for arranging that the ser-ices of his staff should be available to us for the preparation of uaps and plans, and to Mr. E. W. Knightly, the Government Winter, and his staff, for fulfilling so ably and willingly our some-fhat exacting requirements.
INTRODUCTION19. It is a source of regret to us that, even in so long a report we have not been able to do full justice to all the wealth of material that has been placed at our command, and we wish to invite the particular attention of Government to the many able and most useful, memoranda which stand in evidence.20. We desire to place on record our appreciation of the wort done by the members of our staff, and in particular the services oi our Secretary, Mr. S. H. Fazan, without whose ability and nn-tiring industry our task w-ould have been even more protraet&amp;i than has been the case.The precis which he prepared prior to our assembling were o; the greatest assistance in helping us to obtain a grasp of the prob-lems confronting us, and his work in connection with the draftinj of the report has been invaluable.He was peculiarly fitted for the work of Secretary by his knew-ledge of land problems in general and in particular of those is Kikuyu, of both of which he has made a close study.We also wish to express gratitude to Mr. J. F. G. Troughtor for his able services during the four months in which he acted a. Assistant Secretary. He displayed great energy and capability, and the work which he did in collating material for the preparation oi the second part of the report was most valuable.21. In conclusion we wish to express our gratitude for thi most generous hospitality which we have received on all sides.
Classification of Lands(A preliminary statement.)22. There is a preliminary point which we wish to make clear. Bin the course of the chapters which follow we shall sometimes have occasion to recommend that additions be made to native reserves. In such cases we shall draw a distinction between land which we recommend to be added in satisfaction of a claim of ri&quot;ht based on historical grounds or on present and continuous use, and land which we recommend to be added to satisfy economic needs.For ease of reference we shall allude to the first class as A, and the second as B, and in the third part of our Report we siwll make clear the safeguards and special conditions to which, in our opinion, the grants under each class ought to be subject.23. Class B we shall divide into BI and B2, the former being land which we recommend to be added because the tribe appears likely to have permanent need of it, and the latter being land ivhich we recommend to be added to fulfil a need which appears to be of a more temporary character. The nature of the security which we recommend to be provided in each case will be made :lear in Part III.24. There is a third class of land in which we shall recom-mend special facilities for natives, but not on tribal lines. To this :lass of land we refer as Class C, and we shall recommend that the normal method of tenure shall be by lease.25. Occasionally a reference will be found to &quot;Class D.&quot;. This s land in which we recommend that no special privilege of race should obtain in respect either of initial grants or transfers. Class D svould in effect be all the land in the country which is neither existing native reserve nor A, B or C, nor European highlands, lor an area, such as Turkanaj in which certain native tribes have special, though not exclusive rights.26. Although we shall find it convenient, for the purposes of -he Report, to refer to the various categories here described as A, 3. C or D, as the case may be, we shall, towards the end of our Report, propose more suitable designations for them.
PART I THE KIKUYU PROVINCEINTRODUCTION. 27. In the first fifteen chapters of this part we shall deal with the land problems of the three districts of Kikuyu jrroper, namely, South Nyeri, Fort Hall and Kiambu. Whenever such expressions ;is kikuyu land, the Kikuyu country, or the Kikuyu Reserve or Reserves occur in these chapters, they should be understood to relate to the Kikuyu properly so called, inclusive of the Ndia and Kichugu sections, but excluding the Embu and the Meru.28. In the sixteenth chapter we shall deal with the land prob-lems of the Embu and Meru tribes, and in the seventeenth and final chapter of this Part we shall consider certain problems in connexion with the Nairobi Township and Commonage, since Nairobi is officially part of the Kikuyu Province.29. The native land problems of the North Nyeri District bear relation to the Northern Frontier rather than to the Kikuyu Province, and will therefore be held over for discussion in Part II.
CHAPTER I.PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES AND GOVERNING- FACTORS IN THE MATTER OF  THE  KIKUYU  CLAIMS.30. We think that it would be well at the outset to state clearly the principles and essential factors which in our opinion are of importance in connexion with the Kikuyu claims.(1) If a tribe has suffered loss through alienation of part of its territory, it is in equity entitled to be compensated. But the compensation might properly be assessed in accordance with the extent of the true loss sustained, that is to say, according to the degree of use which was made of the land and the purpose which it served, whether at the time of the alienated-tion or as a reasonable reservation for future expansion. We cannot accept the principle that, because a tribe has lost land, it is necessarily and of right entitled to receive equal or equiva-lent land elsewhere, irrespectively of these considerations.Argument. It is a proper function of Government to secure the development of land to the best advantage. While private rights are recognized, a power of interven-tion is commonly preserved to the Crown by means of land acquisition acts and similar legislation, in order that the power of Government to secure a proper development should not be impaired.If therefore the possession of large undeveloped tracts of land by any tribe, person or class is prejudicial to the welfare and development of a country, it would be a proper exercise of the function of Government, when it has armed itself with the necessary powers, to intervene and adjust the matter. The just compensation is for the extent of the true loss sustained, and it would defeat the whole purpose of the action if it were held that for every piece of land taken an equal piece must be added.That the Government in this country may some-times have taken action before it had provided itself with full legal cover does not affect the essential equity of the case as between the Crown and the native, which is simply a matter of assessing an equivalent compensation for the extent of the true loss sustained.(2) The land ought to be accounted fully used if the population, regard being had to the degree of its skill and its mode of life, was living at or beyond the optimum density.
kikuyu province part i chapter 1] certain guiding pjunciw.eiWhere such conditions prevail, the tribe is entitled to be cum. pensated up to the full value of any of its land which is taken. But the greater the margin by which the population falls shot! of this requirement, the greater is the justification of Govern-ment for regarding unoccupied land as waste land of which it had the right and duty to make disposal in the way which it deemed best for the country at large. In such case compeusa-tion might justly be assessed on the extent of the useful pur poses which the land served and not on the extent of the land If the population were very sparse it might well be held thai considerable areas could be alienated without causing any los* beyond a certain loss of amenities.Argument. It is clear that on occasion Government have acted on the principle that the basis of compensation should be the value which the land possessed for ;h person from whom it was taken, regard being had to th purpose for which he was using it. We may cite (thou;;! we do not wish to be taken as expressing an opinion oi the equity of such action in the case of private kind owners) the procedure under the Congested District Act in Scotland and Ireland by which small holdings wei carved from the moorlands of large landowners on nomina compensation, on the ground that the land was in exees of reasonable requirements and that all that had occurre was a trifling loss of amenities.Although these two principles, if we had adhered to them would have provided justification for giving the Kikuyu sub stantially less than an equivalent area for the land lost, yet i the special conditions which resulted from the alienations an which are described below-, we determined that it would h more in accordance with the dictates of the position aud th interests of the Kikuyu that we should agree to settle thet claims of right by adding to the reserve an area equivalent the total extent of their losses.(3) Broadly regarded, the extent of native occupation the Port Hall District both before and after the famine 1898-99 must be held to have been equal to or possibly beyoin the requirements of optimum-density within the area whicl we shall describe as unequivocal Kikuyu territory.   In tli Kiambu district, and possibly also in the Nyeri district, tl extent of native occupation was below these requirements the time when the alienations took place.  But the amount land required for reasonable expansion, and the far-reachis effect of European settlement in drawing population toward the main centres were hardly to be foreseen, and in our opinio
KIKUYU PROVINCE Hut I Chapter I] Certain Guiding Principlesadequate provision was not made. We therefore think it equitable-able that a cJaim as of right should be allowed in respect of the land lost in these two districts, which was, however, in a great measure discharged when the Ndeiya and Mwea districts were made available for occupation by the Kikuyu.Argument. Section (57 in Chapter II shows the population densities as they stood in 1902 as nearly as can be ascertained. Compared with the area which we have found to have been unequivocal Kikuyu territory at the time, the density in the Kikuyu country, over all. appears to have been in the neighbourhood of 250 to the square mile, and in the Kiambu district about 150 to the square mile, though in the areas which were alien-ated it was less than half that density (see section 318). Mr. Ainsworth, the Provincial Commissioner, Ukamba, wrote in that year a letter to the Acting Commissioner dated 22nd September, 1902 : &quot;In travelling through the Kikuyu country south of the Thika, the main point that strikes the traveller is the sparsity of population and the large areas of good land uncultivated.   It is very evident indeed that there is ample room for very extensive settlement in the country without in any way unduly encroaching&quot; on native occupation.&quot; (4) The alienations in the Kiambu district increased the density of the native population, not only by restricting the area, but also in other ways.  They were part of the policy of white settlement which resulted in the establishment of a considerable town and market at Nairobi.   Better transport, better health conditions and better markets have had a great effect on the native population : (a) Instead of growing for their food requirements only-,the natives now grow for the market, a procedure which requires more industry and more land, except in so far as there has been an improvement in their skill in husbandry.(b) The natural increase of the population has not been kept in check by the periodic visitations of disease and famine to which it was formerly subject.(c) The money to be made either by working for settlersoi&apos; by selling produce in Nairobi markets has attracted large numbers of Kikuyu from the other districts into Kiambu district.
KIKITYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter I] Certain Guiding Princii-hWhile it would be ridiculous for the Kikuyu to make grievance out of circumstances from which they have bencfite so greatly, nevertheless a great increase in the population an its land requirements has taken place as a consequence, an. problems of local congestion are arising which threaten ;. become general and perhaps acute in the next generation Government recognizes an obligation to provide for the need of the natives, and we have to deal with this problem unde the first term of reference.(5) While block additions to the reserve are not the onl or necessarily the best way of dealing with congestion proi lems, nevertheless, if land is available, we regard it as ex expedient, in order to provide a reasonable reservation for ex pan sion as mentioned in paragraph (3) above, and to convince th Kikuyu of Government&apos;s desire to discharge all moral obliga tions which can possibly be considered to exist towards them that a &quot;profit and loss&quot; account should be made setting oi the areas of &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory&quot; which have bee: taken away against the additional areas which have beei granted, and that block additions should be made to the resen equivalent to the balance of the Kikuyu losses.(6) Although we have drawn the boundary of unequivoca Kikuyu territory in such a way as to include much debatabl ground, we shall have to consider isolated cases of village built by individual Kikuyu families who had ventured beyon the confines of the tribal territory and have to be regarded a disconnected outposts. In some cases, as, for instance, in th Lari area, account has been taken of such isolated occupatioi in reaching our assessment, but it has naturally not been po-sible to include every village in our reckoning, and nior. especially on the south-eastern border there were several smal clearings in the bush for wliich we have not made specific allow ance. We do not consider it practicable to do so, but w recommend that, as far as a settlement with the tribe at larj is concerned, the question should be merged in the wider pro!) lem with which we deal under the first term of reference namely the duty of making adequate provision for future need; These clearings in the forest were the method by which th; tribe expanded and, if we can offer other means of expansion the tribe will be adequately compensated in this respect.(7) A settlement on tribal lines may not be enough. tli, interests of particular groups or families who have lost Inn! have also to be considered. Chapters VII to X are devoted tc this aspect of the Kikuyu claims and we have made such pro posals as we consider to be just and practicable at this date
KIKUYU PROVINCE &apos;aht I Chapter I] Certain Guiding PrinciplesWe believe that the settlement proposed is just both to the tribe and to the individuals who compose it. In order to satisfy ourselves on this point we have made an examination of the general nature of the private claims and the basis on which they rest, but we are fully persuaded that we are not required under our terms of reference to carry our inquiries beyond this H    necessary point, and we have not done so.31. It will now be relevant to determine what areas should be Regarded as having been &quot;unequivocal Ivikuyu territory.&quot; The Bext four chapters will be devoted to determining the position as fit existed when the Protectorate was declared, but we shall not Begard absolutely everything which has been added since that date Is a gift by Government. A traditional method of extending terri-Bory existed by first clearing and use, and we shall allow that certain Band was admissibly acquired in that manner, except that in certain Breas, where officers of the Forest Department were actively em-Bloyed after the formation of the Department in 1902, we shall not Becognize such acquisition after that date, nor shall we recognize B elsewhere after definite areas were demai-cated as forest reserve.
CHAPTER II.The Existence cf a Forest Belt surround-ing the Kikuyu country.Extent ot&quot; Penetration or occupation by Masai 01 other Tribes in.o the area surround-od by the Forest Belt.CONDITIONS OBTAINING IN  THE KIKUYU COUNT AND ON ITS BORDERS AT THE TIME WHEN THE PROTECTORATE WAS DECLARED. (Together with some incidental notes on subsequent developmentuntil 1902.)32. All early accounts of the Kikuyu territory agree in sta that it was surrounded by a belt of forest of varying width whit served to protect the tribe against its enemies. They further agre that the Kikuyu did not venture outside this belt to build or cult vate or graze their cattle beyond it until the Masai power bega seriously to wane, owing to internecine war and the tremendoti losses of their cattle by disease and until the Protectorate had bee declared. The land may therefore be said, broadly speaking have had two frontiers the outside and the inside of the tote: belt, and it will probably be a fair distinction to regard all t!: land inside the belt as having been at that time &quot;unequivoc; Kikuyu territory&quot; and the belt itself as having been &quot;partially intermittently used by the Kikuyu.&quot;33. A series of extracts from published works will be foiia in Appendix No. 1, section (a).  A perusal of these extracts show quite clearly that the country then occupied by the Kikuyu was fact surrounded by such a belt of forest. Before discussing its esac position, it will be well to dispose of three questions which : concerning it, namely : (I) Were the Masai and other tribes entirely exclude from all use of the land surrounded by the forest belt?(2) Were the Kikuyu entirely excluded from the use i the land outside it?(3) Is the belt itself to be regarded as Kikuyu couiitn To what- extent could the Kikuyu make free and unfettered it: of it?34. In this connevon we have to consider: (a) Dorobo; (1 Masai ; and (c) Kamba. The evidence given before the Kiloiv Land Tenure Committee as well as he evidence given before tlii Commission makes it clear that very few, if any. Dorobo wo: living in the Port Hall or Nyeri Districts at this time. But the inhabited the Kiambu District before the arrival of the Kikuyti who progressively superseded thejn and became masters of tli land by a series of transactions in which the payment of goat sometimes played a part. Some these &quot;sales&quot; appear to ltav taken place as much as eighty years ago, but many others are
l&apos;.\iiT I-Chapter II]KIKUYU PROVINCEConditions from 1895 to 1902moriie recent date and since the Protectorate was declared. There as also been evidence that some of the earlier payments to the ll)orobo, made before that date, were supplemented by a later pay-ent made afterwards. The position in 1s96 therefore was that le Kikuyu were not in all cases the exclusive possessors of the oil even in their own country. There were undoubtedly many orobo who retained rights of various kinds.35. We now turn to the Masai. The account given by Von obnel (Teleki, p. 288, et seq.) makes it clear that they regarded n entry into the Kikuyu country as a very formidable proposition. i&apos;honison&apos;s book, &quot;Through Masailand&quot;, p. 308, period 1883, ihows clearly that the Masai never succeeded in their attempts at netration into the part of the forest which was at that time ccupied by the Kikuyu. Major MacDonald, E.E. (&quot;Soldiering nd Surveying in British East Africa&quot;, p. Ill) points out that captain Lugard in 189i decided against making his station at Fort mith because the Masai &quot;could hardly venture to visit a station the midst of their hereditary enemies.&quot; Several witnesses have ^ven personal testimony to the same effect.36. While there is no serious evidence against the proposition at the Kikuyu were reasonably secure behind their forest bound-ies and maintained themselves aloof from the Masai, there are me exceptional cases alleged which require notice. Statements ve been made in evidence that the Masai : (1) Took their cattle to the salt-lick at the Thathini Swamp, which was on the inner edge of the forest belt.(2) Drove their cattle from the Kapiti Plains to the Kinangop across what is now the Kikuyu country.(3) Built manyattas, of which remains exist on Mr. MacLellan Wilson&apos;s farm which is inside the forest belt, and on the Church of Scotland Mission land at Kikuyu and else-where.37. The first of these statements rests on the evidence of Mr. iacLellan Wilson, which is supported by the evidence of Swahili id Masai witnesses; but correspondence preserved on Kiambu e No. 346/21/13 shows that Mr. Isaac, Provincial Commissioner, uired into this matter in 1913, and that an old Masai wdio had ed near Thathini admitted that it was a Kikuyu salt-lick, never d by the Masai except occasionally in a raid (see Appendix 1, tion (/i). The second statement is based on the memorandum of onel John Ainsworth, there being some supporting evidence by Fasai named Sayet Ole Nagila, and some evidence of a somewhat trary effect by Mr. Knapp and Canon Leakey.   The evidence ;

We believe that Mr. MacLellan Wilson&apos;s views are correct to the extent that Thathini was formerly&apos; a salt-lick used by tin Masai; but we are of opinion that it had been abandoned by then :at the time of the cattle plagues and their inter-tribal wars, an-ithe Kikuyu thereafter had the use of it.39. The track mentioned by Colonel Ainsworth was not i; -ase by the Masai when he saw it in 1898. He regarded it as very old track, and had, been told that it had not been used fo many years before Lenana became Laibon &quot;because after th. Kikuyu began to move south of the Chania there was trouble wit] :the Kikuyu.&apos;&apos; Since Thomson in 1884 recorded the southern Iimr of the Kikuyu as being in the vicinity of Ngongo Bagas, it is clea: -that if the Kikuyu had not yet crossed the Chania when that trac! was made, it must have been a very old track indeed.40. Mr. Knapp refers to it in his evidence and states that a: inquiry was held in Nairobi concerning it with a view to deter mining whether this country had ever been used by the Masai The Kikuyu story advanced at the inquiry, according to Mr. Knap[ was that the track was really a Kikuyu track but that on or. occasion a party of Masai moron tried to force their way throug&apos; with, cattle to the Kinangop and were attacked by the Kikuyu an exterrhinated and that the Kikuyu ever afterwards called it &amp; Masai track in derision. This explanation certainly not does nt square with Colonel Ainsworth&apos;s account of an exceptionally dee track, which caused him to ask the question. The best view of tl: &quot;two conflicting accounts is pjrobably that very many years ago ri Masai used the track, but that on one occasion after the Kikuji had established themselves south of the Chania, a party of Masa was exterminated by them, and the Masai never attempted to pa; that way again. But as the date is given as &quot;many years befor Lenana became Laibon&quot; it is clear that the use of the track ha) already been abandoned by the Masai before the dates with whit the present inquiry is concerned.41. As to the possible presence of occasional manyattas insic the Kikuyu country, an explanation has been offered by son witnesses that sometimes there was intermarriage and the relatior of the bride sometimes followed her; or more generally, that whe peace prevailed, settlement by Masai in Kikuyu was allowed t sufferance. But Dr. Boedeker regards these cases as not daiir before 1S94, when Mr. Hall established better relations betwes
KIKUYU PROVINCE Mit 1-Chapter II] Conditions prom 1895 to 1002lie Kikuyu aud the Masai and gave some of the Kaputiei Masai eave to settle in the district.   This would appear to accord best vitli the records of the early explorers.   Von Hohnel does not mention that any Masai were found living in kikuyu land, but here is evidence to show that at the time of the rinderpest about 889 the Kaputiei Masai came to the borders of Kikuyu country, uid both Kikuyu and Masai witnesses state that after the defeat of of the Kaputiei section of the Masai by the Ijoita Masai, a number if the former sought refuge in Kikuyu country and established liages there.  This may account for the belief of several respon-ible witnesses that much of the land which we consider to have en unequivocal Kikuyu country was occupied by the Masai.4-2. The conclusion therefore seems to be warranted that in the icriod which we are considering the Masai did not establish them-elves anywhere in kikuyu land insid,e the protective belt of forests, xcept as refugees.  They raided the country sometimes, and were ided in turn.   Sometimes they helped one section of the Kikuyu raid another (John Boyes, p. 94).   Add to this that there was reciprocal arrangement by which the Masai women used to enter ikuyu country to trade and vice versa, and we have stated the otal extent of the effective use which the Masai had of the Kikuyu otmtry enclosed by the forest belt about 1895.   About the date hen the Masai power had declined and some of the elements had ade friends with the Kikuyu and settled among them, there was tore reciprocity and Masai cattle were sometimes seen grazing in ikuyu country.43. Turning to the Kamba we find several references in evidence-uce to mutual raids between the Kikuyu and the.Kamba, but the ference is to the period after the Masai power had begun to ecline.  Nevertheless it cannot be held that even before this the kuyu were entirehr immune from Kamba raids.   In a passage hich will be cited in another connexion below (section 188) Von ohnel observes that when he and Count Teleki were a little south the Thika and to the west of the boundary wood they went rough an area which the Kikuyu had left uninhabited for fear of amba &quot;slave raids.&quot;44. Subject to the limitations described above the land sur-unded by the forest belt may be held to be &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu rritory.&quot; The degree to which it was effectively occupied is an sue which we hold over for later discussion.45. We now turn to the second question : &quot;Were the Kikuyu Extent of tirely excluded from the use of any land beyond the forest belt?&quot; ^jS1^ J56&quot;6&quot; xtracts from books will be found in section (a) of Appendix No. 1 the &quot;ForestOU( lich show that the Kikuyu can have made very little use of the Belt-I.r.a. outside the forest prior to the decline of the Masai power,

African Empire&quot; (p. 335) that they sometimes set fire to the Mass grazing in order to prevent the Masai using it, but there i-evidence to support the Kikuyu contention that they themsoh\ used to go out of the forest on to the plains to graze their cat tit The only European witnesses who can speak of that period nt Colonel Ainsworth and Mr. C. W. Hobley, and their evidenc shows conclusively that up till 1894 practically no cultivation an no natives other than the Masai were seen outside the forest be! in the general neighbourhood of the site where Nairobi now stands The relevant extracts from their evidence will be found in sectio (b) of the Appendix. But shortly after this period Kikuyu village began to appear. (See evidence, pp. 653. 718, 742, 863 and s7:; by Mr. Sandbach Baker, Mr. McQueen. Air. T. A. Wood, l!rv Canon Leakey and Bev. Canon Burns.)46. The further recorded evidence suggests, however, that th Kikuyu were slow to take advantage of the absence of the Mas from this plain. The extracts from evidence given in section (j and (h) of the Appendix prove that there was no permanent occt pation of these plains either by the Kikuyu or by the Kamba a this time. Both Mr. Lane and Mr. Tate refer to constant raidin between the Kikuyu and the Kamba, which may explain Hi reason.47. The best view on the evidence appears to be that, before the decline of the Masai power had become evident, the Kikuy did not venture on to these plains at all. By 189S their huts bega to be seen on the very edge of the forest belt near Muthaiga at: perhaps elsewmere, but for several years afterwards the use whic they made of the plains for grazing or other purposes was so sligl that it escaped the notice of travellers, except that possibly the crossed it for the purpose of raiding the Kamba.48. A similar situation perhaps existed on the plains to &amp; north of the Kikuyu of Nyeri District. Compare the evidence i Major Orde Brown (Evidence pp. 3S3 and 384).&quot;Of the plain between Kiambu and Port Hall up to Nye I believe the Kikuyu were very largely denied occupation i the Masai ... In my opinion, what they claim and wh they really occupied are two very different things.&quot;&apos;49. While we find nothing in the evidence or in records: show that natives of the Kiambu or Port Hall districts ever pen trated to any extent beyond the forest belt within the period wit which we are concerned, it seems that on the northern frontier the Nyeri Kikuyu more intercourse prevailed and certain ICikin families established friendly relations with the Masai. The ot; standing case seems to be that of Wangombc. Headman Nden
ai,her, whom Mr. John Boyes regarded as being &apos;&apos;one of the three -uling chiefs at that time&quot; (p. 143 of his book) and &quot;by far the (ingest and most influential of the three.&quot; The position of this tillage was close to Niana Hill on the borders of the forest reserve&quot; n what is now Chief Murigo&apos;s Location, and it is so shown in the nap which was made about 1898 to illustrate Sir Alfred Mackinder&apos;s purney. It is Map Sheet A 37/B ; a copy has been filed in Volume of the original record of the evidence.50. Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that dread of the ilasai did not operate in the Nyeri District as elsewhere to keep he Kikuyu within bounds. In Nyeri Native Tribunal Revision ?ase 23/29, which was a dispute about a githaka close by Nyeri Till, but inside the gazetted Kikuyu Reserve, the defendant fated :-&quot;Before the Government came, all that land was bush and nobody went there because of lions and elephants and the Masai. When iny father went in, although he was not the first man who went into the bush, nobody else had estab-iished himself in that part and no iihaka had been fixed.&quot;51. Before leaving the question of the Kikuyu claim to have leen in occupation of land outside the foi&apos;est belt, there is a further :Spect of the matter to which reference must be made. The Southern Kikuyu support their claim to the land not only on the [round of occupation, but also on the ground of purchase of land )y individual Kikuyu groups or families. They claim that some if this land is situated beyond the forest belt and that the families oncerned bought it partly for their present use and partly as a irovision for future expansion. We deal with the claim in Chapter 711, in which we review the whole question of the alleged Dorobo and sales.52. We now come to the third question : &quot;Is the forest belt Extent of tself to be regarded as Kikuyu country?   To wdiat extent could utilization of health  Kikuyu make free and unfettered use of it?&quot; the actualForest Belt.The first part of the question is perhaps not very important Luce there were no definite frontiers, but, for what it is worth, Shere seems to be a consensus of opinion among the earlier authori-Kes that &quot;kikuyu land&quot; included the protective belt of forest. That K not to say that it included the whole of the Aberdare Forest or Pie West Kenya Korest, but that it included so much of the sur-Hounding forest as was used by the Kikuyu for their protection.if 53. But the more important point is whether the Kikuyu had She exclusive and unrestricted use of this forest and what were the bsc&apos;s to which they could put it.KIKUYU PROVINCE VutT I Chapter II] Conditions mom 1895 to 1902
KIKUYTJ PROVINCE Part I Chatter II] Conditions prom 1895 to 1D02They had not the exclusive use of it. The Dorobo also wen there, at least in the parts bordering on the Kiambu District. The; hunted there and, if we believe Kikuyu accounts, were the origina owners, and still owned large unsold portions of it until a boiripara-tively recent date. The Masai dispute this. According to then there are Kikuyu Dorobo who are in reality Kikuyu who have taker to hunting, and Masai Dorobo who are true Dorobo and serfs of tin Masai who would not have allowed them to dispose of it. The\ admit that the Dorobo may have disposed of it secretly after tin Masai power had declined.54. We shall review the evidence on this very contention! subject in a later chapter.  Two points only need be stated here :(a) It is said by the Kikuyu that when Kinanjui was &quot;Para mount&quot; Chief, a secondary payment at a date well after 1900 was made to the Dorobo to complete the purchases and make them final. If this is true, it constitutes ai admission that up to that date the purchases were no-final.(fe) The Dorobo claim that there are large areas in the forest and some areas in the Kikuyu Reserve itself which have never been sold yet and are still theirs.55. That is one of the respects in which the Kikuyu had not an exclusive use of the forest. The other is in respect of the Masai. The nervousness created by the Masai raids is well illustrated in the following description by Von Hohnel : Page 289 (At Ngongo Bagas). &quot;We had . . . no need to be anxious about provisions. Even large caravans such as ours could easily in normal seasons buy food for several month; of the Kikuyu in a very short time. There are no market-exactly like those in other parts of Africa, as the Kikuyu dc not venture out of the forests for fear of the Masai and cara-vans have to seek them. A well-armed contingent of a travel-ling party goes into the wood and calls the attention of the natives by firing two or three shots ... In a few minutes the signal is answered by the appearance of some envoys, a time and spot are fixed on for the holding of a market and is. due course the traders make their way to the rendezvous soon to be joined by hundreds of men and women laden with the superfluous produce of their fields, which they are very glad to dispose of. All now goes merrily and in a few minutes piles of provisions are exchanged for strings of beads, but the slightest misunderstanding, an unmeaning and generally quite groundless cry of terror from either side is enough to cause ali the natives to flee wildly away ...&quot;   (Von Hohnel then goes
KIKUYU PROVINCE 1&apos;aiit I Chapter II] Conditions from 1895 to 1902on to describe how an old Masai woman was used as an inter-intermediary and a market was fixed on the banks of a stream to I     which many women, but only four old men brought food for sale.)A passage from &quot;James Hanningtou&quot; by the Rev. E. C. [Uawson, which is quoted in section (a) of the Appendix, also illus-irates the extreme nervousness of the Kikuyu in this neighbour-wod.50. Even on the inner edge of the forest belt near Einiuru Biation the Kikuyu do not seem to have been very sure of them-;elves. As an example, Mr. S. Morson, referring to the year 190-1, mentions in his evidence that certain Kikuyu were unwilling to proceed from Limuru on to Uplands for fear of the Masai.57. Whether the Masai made any great use of the forest glades for purposes of grazing except in times of drought is perhaps open to doubt, though the evidence of Mr. Patterson states quite ieiinitely that they did graze there to some extent. Thomson lop. cit., p. 310) confirms this. The relevant extracts will be found n section (a) of the Appendix. Some Masai witnesses have stated hat the Masai moran used to assemble in the forest for holding neat-feasts, and we are satisfied that this is true in spite of some jvidence to the contrary. The Masai Elder Lengemogik Ole S^akorde deposed that the forest belt on the southern and eastern jorder of Kikuyu was Masai country, but that they sold some of it :o Dorobo families, some of whom were afterwards adopted by Kikuyu. He represented this to have happened before the white nen came.58. The statement that the forest formed a protective belt -uund the Kikuyu country possibly contains the implication that t was left by the Kikuyu for that purpose. That can only be par-ially true. There were perhaps places where it had worn so thin fiat the Kikuyu could not venture to cut any more for fear of lestroying the barrier, and probably that is what Mr. MacGregor loss meant when he stated in his evidence that it was deliberately eft by the Kikuyu. But there were places where the forest was far leeper than the requirements of protection demanded, e.g., on the lopes of the Aberdares, and we may take it as certain that these arge tracts were not deliberately left, but the Kikuyu wrere destroy-ng them as fast as they could. While we may agree that the com-aratively narrow fringes of forest on the south and east and lossibly the north were occupied by the Kikuyu to a greater extent ban they were occupied by the Dorobo or Masai and may, in a [eneral sense and within limits, be called Kikuyu country, it can-tot in any sense be held that the remoter parts of the forest on be Aberdares had anything to do with the Kikuyu.   There is no
KIKUYU PROVINCE Paiit I Chapter II] Conditions from 1895 to 1902likelihood that they made any use of them at all. That they used to graze their goats &quot;a good way in&quot; is admitted by Mr. A. (;, Baker in his evidence, but he also states that the glades whicl occur on the Aberdares are infrequent and generally the result o! human destruction.59. The present gazetted boundary of the Aberdares is at an average altitude of 7,000 feet, and it could therefore have been ol no use to the Kikuyu in those days for cultivation. We may here quote from a letter written by Mr. Hobley in 1913 : &quot;From 5,300 feet to about 5,900 feet is the grazing zone where it is not covered by forest, and the wild oat gras; thungari is particularly valuable for cattle. Above this contom comes the maize and millet zone which extends from about 5,900 feet to 6,700 feet. Above that altitude native cereals wil riot flourish well, they are liable to frost and are genera!!; dwarfed; the only grain the Kikuyu grow above that altitndi is a Pennisetnm called Kinyoli or Kamanga which is not : profitable grain to gr&apos;ow; above 6,700 feet sweet potatoes ever become very small.&quot;60. It is therefore quite unlikely that the Kikuyu made an; use at all of parts of the Aberdares which were more remote thai two miles from the forest edge as it existed at the time. The con elusions which we suggest as to the position about 1s96 is that tin forest belt was Kikuyu land only to the extent to which the Kikuyi were making use of it, but that they had not by any means th exclusive or unimpeded use of it; that the land surrounded by th forest belt was exclusively Kikuyu; and that the land external ti the forest belt wras not Kikuyu at all.61. It now remains to define the position of the forest belt an generally to determine the Kikuyu boundaries. But first, in orde to complete this survey of conditions obtaining in Kikuyu when tli Protectorate was declared and to provide preliminary data nece; sary for the understanding of the chapters which follow, it will b necessary to attempt an examination of the degree of density a which Kikuyu land was inhabited. It will not be possible to giv even a rough estimate of the density obtaining when the Pro tectorate was declared and there is no practical reason for attempt ing it. We may- content ourselves with saying that in all reason able probability the population in 1895 must have been considered   ably greater than it was in 1902, because by 1902 it had not ye had time to recover from the mortality caused by the 1S98-9 famine. But the significant year is 1902, at which date the polic of alienation of undeveloped land to Europeans may be said to hav begun, and we consider that a method of calculation can be foun which is sufficiently reliable to present an approximately accural picture.
310KIKUYU PROVINCE &apos;akt I Chapter II] Conditions from 1895 to 190262. It is a strange thing that among all that has been written The Popula-o defend or to attack the action of Government in respect of the ;,&apos;10i9U2enslty lienation of undeveloped land which was either in or near the Ivikuyu territory, there should be no contemporary record of thetroree of population-density in the Ivikuyu country and apparently o record of any subsequent attempt to estimate what it was. There e records of a few general observations, such, for instance, as that ie Kikuyu could be required to &quot;bunch up)&quot; and would &quot;bear nueezing&quot;, and a statement in a surveyor&apos;s map of 1907 that there is ample room for further settlement should it be foundtecessary to move more Kikuyu into the reserve.&quot; Descriptions of le country show that, while some of it could be described as &quot;one ist garden&quot;, there were many parts which still had all the appear-nce of unbroken forest. From such allusions and from the opinions f witnesses we are able, in spite of the wide divergence of views kpressed, to get a general impression, which, however, we have found it useful to correct in the light of deductions drawn from the (tatistics available for later years.63. We must anticipate the results of our survey of the bound-Jries which will be found in Chapters III to V and record here flhat the total area which we find to have been  &quot;unequivocal ikuyu Territory&quot; in 1s96 is approximately 1,640 square miles, bid that by 1902, before any considerable alienations, it had spread ffo about 1,778 square miles (See Note 1 to section 217).64. In the memorandum on &quot;The Kate of Population Increase if the Kikuyu Tribe&quot;, which stands in the original record of the vidence and which we consider to be as accurate as is obtainable n the data, the total number of Kikuyu married women in 1909, e earliest year of which account is taken, is given as 124,679 for Uyeri, Port Hall and Kiambu Districts exclusive of what is now ihe Keruguya sub-District. In the years between 1922 and 1931, i which an estimate for the whole area is included, the Keruguya figures range between 18.2 per cent and 18.8 per cent of the total, he percentage appearing to increase slightly as the years go on. Ne may perhaps assume without any grave error that it was about 8 per cent in 1909, which would make the total of married women pr the three districts 152.0S4 at that time.65. In the table showing the total population for all Kikuyu n 1931 married women are found to be 29.4 per cent of the whole jnd the children 41 per cent. But in 1909 it is probable, for reasons vhich appear in the memorandum, that the percentage of children ras somewhat lower and that of married women somewhat higher, nd we may probably set the married women down as 31 per cent f the whole. In that case the total population would have been 90,477 in 1909.
KIKTJYTJ  1&apos;ROVINCEPart I Chapter II]Conditions mom 1895 to lijffi66. The opinion given in the memorandum and based on such figures as are available is that in the pre-war years the population was increasing in normal years at a rate of about 1.2 per cent yearly. If this opinion is true the population was about 451,560 in 1902, since there is no reason why the years 1902 to 1909 should not be regarded as normal.67. A comparison with 1931, when presented in tabular form, is interesting :  1902 ... 451,562 ... 1,778 ... 254 1931      ...      489,156      ...      1,931      ...      253Note 1. While in 1902 the number of Kikuyu living outside kikuyu land was negligible, in 1931 the figure is estimated to have been 110,697.Note 2. The figure 1,931 includes the Mwea area (205 square miles), the addition of which to the native reserve has been a p. proved by the Governor in Council, but which has not yet been gazetted as part of the native reserve, although the natives havf been allowed to occupy it.Note 3. The figure 489,156 is the official estimate for 1932. The figure given in the memorandum on the rate of population-increase in Kikuyu is 493,502. Both of these figures are estimate-to the extent that children have been computed on a percentage basis in each case and not by actual count. We offer no opinion as to which is the better estimate but have accepted the official figure.Note 4. If the density is taken only over the area of the reserve as gazetted (the Mwea area being excluded) the figure i; rendered 283 to the square mile.The conclusion suggested is that in 1902 kikuyu land was in-habited in very much the same density as it is now and that although the population has increased greatly, the method of dis-posing of the surplus has been by a resort to squatting on alienate lands.68. There are two reasons why the high order of population-density which obtained in 1902 was not readily apparent. The first is that the Kikuyu did not grow produce tor the market exten-sively at that time, but grew it principally for their own consunip-tion. It has been estimated that, at the time when the Lirmm farms were alienated, the average Kikuyu woman had about om acre under cultivation. That would mean that in the Kikuyi country as a whole only one acre in eight was cultivated. At tit present day approximately one acre in three is cultivated.Year.Resident Population.Area of Territory Density per (square miles),   square mile.
KIKUYU PROVINCE [__Chapter II] Conditions from 1s96 to 1902&apos;69. The second reason is that the Kiambu Distict was much e generally known than the others and it was that district ::h particularly interested the applicants for land.   It was farthickly populated, both because it was the district into which c Kikuyu had most recently penetrated, and also because the-iiniue of 1898-99, besides causing many deaths, had brought about jstampede of the survivors back to Fort Hall. There is no evidence-ice from which one can estimate with any certitude how many them had returned by 1902. But, regarded in isolation, the strict must have appeared to have enough land for its population ir generations to come and a good deal which could reasonably he wred to others. It was perhaps imperfectly realized that it had for any years been used as an expansion area for the more densely ipulated districts of Fort Hall and Nyeri and that more than its. -ii natural increase of population had to be taken into account.7(1. The memorandum shows the total married women from atnbu District in 1909 as 23.380, which may be interpreted as a :al population of 75,139, the women being reckoned as 31 per m. The rate of natural increase is assumed in the memorandum ho 1.2 per cent, a figure which is extremely problematical, but not particularly improbable. That would mean that all the-serious family units which in .1909 made up a population of 75,439 tsons were represented in 1902 by a strength of 69,401 persons. money were not all living in the Kiambu District at that time, since very large proportion of them had taken refuge temporarily in nt Hall District at the time of the famine and had not yet timed. The Kiambu Native Reserve to-day is just 400 square les in extent and we have found on the evidence which will be iewed in the next three chapters that the areas added and the as taken away so nearly balance each other that the same figure y be taken, for the purpose of the present rough calculation, tothe extent of Kikuyu territory in the Kiambu District in 1902. the 69,401 persons had all been living in it the density w-oulde been 173 to the square mile.Hut so high a figure would be inconsistent with the evidence 1 we may conclude with certainty that a large proportion of this ulation was living in the Fort Hall District.But if the population over all Kikuyu was as dense as 254 to square mile it follows that, the lower the estimate for Kiambu, higher must be the estimate for the remainder, and it appears us unlikely that the density figure for the Fort Hall District r all could have been as much as three hundred to the square e if the extent of forest or scrub covered land was as great as have found it to have been, though parts of it were undoubtedly re densely peopled.
KIKUYU  PROVINCE Part I Chapter II] Conditions prom 1895 to ll-fj71. After taking these points into consideration and other which will be reviewed in sections 291-321 below, we have forma the opinion on the probabilities of the case that the population density in the Kiambu Reserve in 1902 was about 150 to the squas mile or perhaps rather less, and that in the areas actually alienate it was only some 73 to the square mile.72. On the basis of calculation which has already been followe this would mean that only 50 acres in a square mile, or roughly on acre in thirteen, were cultivated or fallow land as a general average&quot; in the Kiambu District, while in the areas taken for alienation th proportion would be about one acre cultivated (including fallow) i every twenty-nine. It is therefore understandable that there shonl have appeared to be large tracts of waste lands of which it w; felt that the Crown might legitimately dispose. The areas of whic the Crown actually did dispose within the boundaries of Kikm territory are shown in the coloured map following section 227 which reference should here be made. The reasons supporting tl map will be given in Chapters III to V, while in Chapter VI an estimate is attempted of the number of persons who we actually inhabiting the land at the time when it was alienated.

The conclusions reached in this chapter are illustrated the coloured map following Chapter VI, and the argument will e easier to follow if reference is made to it as we proceed.)78. When Count Teleki made his journey in 1887 the southern Nyeri.. ^]o-e of the forest belt evidently began several miles south of the iresent site of Nyeri.   He crossed the Gura, which he calls the ura, on the morning of 3rd October, 1887, after having already : \a) had trouble in collecting his cattle which &quot;had dispersed in very direction&quot;; (b)  passed several villages;  (c) had a porter fturdered and avenged his death.   It cannot therefore have been ery early in the day when he reached the river and he records Rbat he took an hour to get the safari across.  Many natives, out-numbering his safari by fifty to one, had gathered on the ridges jfo the northward, and he had to move with caution. Nevertheless, by midday he had reached the inner edge of the boundary forest : Page 3-17. &quot;We arrived about midday at a broad, shallow reed-grown brook and camped at the edge of the forest of the northern frontier. This was our last march in Ivikuyuland. We had only to pass through the wood and we should be again I    in the open uninhabited wilderness.&quot;74. The position of the camp has been placed by Mr. Gosden If the Survey Department at a point five miles south of the present ioundarv of the reserve. The manner in which this conclusion las been reached will be explained later, and it is only right to Say that the data provided by Von Hohnels map and diary of his journey are too meagre to warrant any very precise deductions. Put it leaves no doubt but that the forest line was much further :Soiith than it is to-day.75. This is also shown by the map of Sir Alfred Mackinder&apos;s Ipurney (see copy filed in Volume I of the original record of the ividence).  The colours in the original are so faint that the copy as been prepared to bring these out more clearly.   The present iosition of the farm area is shown in the copy though naturally not the original.  Though it is not stated on the map at what date k was prepared it may be concluded from the position of rail-Bead, marked &quot;July, 1899&quot; that it was made about that year.  It jf probable that the colours were put in at the same time.  These

Thf are so many obvious inaccuracies in some parts of the map that would be foolish to place too much reliance on the other parts. [ for what it is worth it may be noticed that the forest belt between Ndoro (see next paragraph) and the cultivated land extends mi; further south than the present boundary of the Kikuyu Reserve.76. Count Teleki took three days marching to get from t! inner frontier camp north of the Gura River to his outer front camp at Ndoro. His average daily journey between Ngongo a Ndoro was only about five miles. Mr. Gosden&apos;s reproduction mai the total a straight ten miles from the Gura Camp to Ndoro. T first day&apos;s journey was through thick bush rather than for (p. 348).77. The position had altered considerably when Mr. Jo B-oyes visited the district in 1898, and he found a man nan. Kakeri, whom he describes as a powerful chief, living near Nye On page 139 of his book he states that Kakeri was living on f actual site of Nyeri Township, but he has admitted in eviden that he may have been mistaken. The information obtained the District Commissioner has now established that the man question was Kakeri wa Ngunju, who was alleged in evidence Chief Nduini to be the father of the young man who killed t Goan and Somali traders at Kiandongoro. He was a man wealth and influence around Nyeri, but the site of his village I been located at a point on the edge of the present reserve aba four miles north-west of the centre of Nyeri Township.78. Of Chief Nduini Mr. Boyes stated that, to the best of 1 knowledge and belief, he or his family were living right up on t forest edge, approximately where they are living now, that is say, at the extreme northern limit of the reserve.79. In Nyeri Native Tribunal Revision Case No. 23/29 t defendant was the son of Chief Nduini&apos;s elder brother. The i puted piece of land was on the githaka known as Ihururu, whi is the piece of native reserve which juts out west and north Nyeri Hill. The Defendant, having stated that there were no there till his father first cleared the land, proceeded : &quot;Gikonyo came afterwards and passed by my father a:went on ahead, and Nduini did the same.  Beyond Nduinieven now there are no ithaka.&apos;180. Brother Benedetto (Evidence pp. 546, 547) stated that I knew Ihururu and that it was bush land when the mission fir went there in 1903. He heard that the Aithirandu clan were tot:
KTKUYU PROVINCE part I Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boundariesvrest of Nyeri Hill. Chief Ndnini&apos;s father&apos;s village, he stated, had been at the site of the present Kamakwa market, which is in thereserve.81. The mission to which Brother Benedetto is attached is at MiL-than (L.O. 1105), which lies between Nyeri Township and (iyeri Hill. His evidence is that there were no natives there in L903, and that the word &quot;Mathari&quot; itself means &quot;the place of lividing.&quot; He states that there were Masai on the site of the present polo ground which is 41- miles to the north of Nyeri Town-ship- .82. The Nyeri Local Native Council ask for Nyeri Hill on the (round that it was formerly used for sacrificial purposes. But no vidence has been advanced to show that it was more venerable han the hundreds of other places which were used for a similar impose. Brother Benedetto said he had never heard of its having leen used for that purpose, though he admits that it might have leen.83. The gazettement of 1913 (Official Gazette. 1st November, 913, p. 035) included Nyeri Hill, the Mathari Mission and the lluringato Forest Nursery in the reserve. The gazettement of 1926 Official  Gazette of 13th October.  1926. p. 1214-1217)  excludedhem.84. It is probable that some degree of Kikuyu occupation had xisted in this area : (a) Kakeri had a large following in 1898 and was regarded byMr. Boyes as a powerful chief. It seems unlikely that he could have been confined to the small area in Chief Nduini&apos;s present location especially if the claims of the families of Nduini and Nderi in the same neighbourhood have any substance in them.(b) Headman Nderi has submitted a memorandum claimingKahehu, a neighbouring area a little way to the north. While his claim that it was his father&apos;s land is by no means proved, it is certain that he himself lived there with his followers for several years from about 1900.(c) The fact of its gazettement in 1913 supports the view thatit was regarded as Kikuyu country.(d) It&apos; Chief Nduini&apos;s location to the west and north-west ofit has rightly been declared native reserve, it is hard to see how this land can have been surrounded on three sides by native land without itself having been native land.85. Nevertheless there is evidence that much forest and thick ash remained, and there is nothing to suggest that the land wasI
Part I Chapter HI]KIKUYU province the Old Kivuyu Pound;Along the Aberdnres to the Southern Chania River.extensively used by the Kikuyu for cultivation or grazing, a probably not much material loss occurred through its exclusio from the reserve. The presence of Masai manyatta on the site i the present polo ground must have acted as a distinct check on tl freedom of the Kikuyu to use the land as they pleased.86. While we shall not undertake to say where the limit Kikuyu territory was in 1895, we consider that by the time tin Nyeri administrative station was established the Kikuyu had w? a footing there, and that their true boundary at that time follows along the Muringatu River where it leaves the present boundary i the reserve until it reaches what is now the western corner of ti forest nursery; thence across by the nearest route to the Chant and thence by the Chania to the present boundary. According; that view a block of 6.08 square miles has been taken out of *&apos; reserve.87. While for the purposes of the &quot;Profit and Toss&quot; aceo which appears in Chapter VI, the whole of this area will appeal taken from the Kikuyu, it will be treated for purposes of assess compensation as a special case and will be reviewed as such Chapter X, since the fact that the area has been developed par as a mission and partly as a Government station and townsl providing essential services to the Kikuyu, ought to be taken consideration.88. We now trace the border along the Aberdares. The exi ing boundary of the reserve follows the forest line as it stood the time of the demarcation in 1907. It was a &quot;give and tak boundary and was done on broad lines (Evidence of Mr. A. Baker, p. 451). Mr. Home considers that there was more ta than give (Evidence p. 586). It is not unnatural to suppose tl this would be the case because any straightening out there mig be would entail much less labour on the spot if a piece of gra land projecting into the forest was cut off. But there is no dir evidence that there was any substantial balance either way, a both Mr. Baker and Mr. Battiscombe thought that the natives w fairly treated (Evidence pp. 451 and 410) and we are satisfied th however that may have been with regard to the actual position 1907, the boundary was a very generous one as regards the Kikw as compared with what the position must have been in 1902.89. The present general average width of the Fort Tl Reserve is in the neighbourhood of twenty-three miles. Cob Teleki represented the average width of the Kikuyu country to from eight to eleven miles (p. 351). This cannot be taken vf seriously since he was merely passing through the country at had no good means of observing it. But Mr. HalTs opinion is
KIKUYU PROVINCE Mir 1 Chapter III] The Oid Kiyuyu Boundarieso lightly to be disregarded since he knew the Kikuyu intimately, is  given   in   &quot;British   East   Africa   or   Ibea&quot;   (by   P.   L. fcuiDermott) : Page 423. &quot;Mr. Hall describes the country as about 100 miles in length and fifteen to eighteen miles in breadth, en-circled by a dense belt of forest, which affords effective pro-tection to the people from their enemies. The elevation of the country varies from 6,000 to 7,200 ft. . . . With the exception of small patches of excellent grass, which are kept for grazing purposes, and a few small swamps, every available piece of ground is under cultivation, and the district might be described as one vast garden.&quot;The Kikuyu have cleared their country of forest by their own exertions and continue to extend this operation.&quot;90. Mr. John Boyes stated in his evidence (p. 728) that in 198 the village of a Kikuyu chief named Karon, who was of mixed jprobo-Kikuyu extraction, was situated within a mile of the forest ge. That accords pretty well with its present position, about lj les from the forest to the west of it, and would appear j at first ht, to suggest that there has not been much destruction since it date. But while there may not have been much destruction in !e immediate neighbourhood of Karnri&apos;s, this was because he had Ready created something of a salient for himself by cutting ahead I his fellows. Much forest land still existed behind him, which Slier Kikuyu now engaged themselves in destroying. A letter ffited 15th December, 1907, from the Chief Conservator of Eorests H the Secretary of the Administration makes this clear : &quot;The destruction of forest that has taken place during the last few years can only be described as appalling. It will be sufficient to cite one instance from a recent report by Mr. Cox of the Survey Department : &apos;On my march from survey beacon Muhenia ... to beacon Kiaheho ... I noticed much destruction of forest. My road lay along the western edge of Kikuyu cultivation in Karori&apos;s district, and when I passed early in September last, the natives were cutting and burning the forest in order to move further west.&apos; &quot;91. The report was made in the same year as the forest ndary was demarcated.  Yet Muhenia beacon is two miles out-[e the forest reserve and Kiaheho is eight miles outside it, and iy are ten miles apart.  This indicates that in 1907, the year in ach the forest reserve was demarcated, a block of land amount-118 &apos;0 a^ou*i forty square miles on this ten-mile front was included lie Kikuyu Native Reserve, though it mainly consisted of forest.
ICIKUYU PROVINCE Part I- Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu BoraIf this sort of thing was done all the way north to Nyeri and i the way south to Limuru, there does not seem to be much iol in the contention that there was more take than give on tl of the Forest Department when the boundaries were demareatl It is obvious that we cannot think of the forest edge of the XM dares as having been a clear-cut boundary. The Kikuyu \vt cutting and burning their way into it haphazard, and the was a jagged line with indentations and promontories extendl for miles. It is therefore quite impossible to reach a conclusl as to where the forest boundary was in 1895.92. We might attempt a &quot;give-and-take&quot; line by way rough approximation,  and  we might  perhaps take Mr. 1 estimate as a guide and, by comparing it with the present width) the reserve, conclude that an average depith of round about] miles has been cleared since then.   This estimate is too big be easily credible and should certainly be discounted.   The tions on the Aberdare Forest boundary have been inhabitedl reasonable density for many years, and the apparent forest r have been largely a shell concealing the habitations and cleari The very rapidity with which it has disappeared helps to prove ;93. For this reason we shall not deny to this area its j to be classed as &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory&quot; in 1895, but shall add the qualification that it had not yet been fully won ft the forest. This distinction we shall mark by a line drawn on map with the help of such information as we have. It may bt assistance in assessing tho &quot;Profit and Loss&quot; account of Kikuyu when we have to compare the value of what they have 1: given with the value of what has been taken away.94. The area round about Nyeri, of which we have alre spoken, may appropriately be treated in the same way.The &quot;Western 95. When we come south of the Chania into Kiambu Distj&amp; itmk&apos; there is equal evidence that the destruction of the forest was District ceeding rapidly. In 1907 the Conservator of Forests (Mr. Hutuwrote : &quot;The forest between the Lari Swamp and the AberdJ Saltinia Range is being rapidly destroyed by the riativesj have elsewhere quoted Mr. Hinde&apos;s opinion that this de tion is going forward at an alarming rate. Mr. Hinde esti that a forest belt averaging half-a-mile in breadth is destroyed yearly.&quot;   (See Report to the Secretary of 1st June, i907,&apos;in L.O. Pile 7,1S8.) 96. We may therefore conclude that the present forest bouj ary in that quarter is very much further outwards than it va 1895, and it may be regarded as certain that the 1907 ho

It should be noted that the land behind the present jorest boundary rises very rapidly all along the Aberdares, and a Ine taken parallel to it a^ a distance of two miles in shows an irerage height of 8,000 ft.   In spite of the large number of huts inch the Kikuyu represent to have been inhabited in the forest Evidence pp. 83 and 98), one cannot easily credit that they as-:extended to these altitudes to depasture their stock in the dense irest, and it may be taken as practically certain that the huts -ere situated nearer to the edge.97. As against this view might be quoted the various references i Mianzini as having been Kikuyu country (position shown on homson&apos;s Map, Teleki&apos;s Map, the War Office Map, and Jack-)n&apos;s Map). But a closer study of them shows that in so far as mt country was occupied at all, it was by Dorobo rather than ikuyu : Discovery by Count Teleki of Lakes Rudolf, etc.Page &quot;287. &quot;Purchases are therefore either made here (Ngongo Bagas) where the natives are dealt with direct, or at Mianzini, a place a little further on, a*lso on the borders of Kikuyu, where the Dorobo act as go-betweens.&quot; From &quot;Early Days in East Africa&quot; (Sir Frederick Jackson).Page 172. &quot;Our last camp in the inhabited areas was on the edge of the deep and thickly wooded ravine . . . Next morn-ing in drizzling rain and fog . . . we entered the forest and for the next four days we crawled along until we reached Mianzini, where we camped in an open space surrounded by bamboos.&quot;(Note. Sir Frederick had started his journey from a camp which was practically on the site where Muthaiga Club is now, and took six days to get to Mianzini, for the last four of which he went through uninhabited bush.)The Conservator of Forests, Mr. H. M. Gardner, commenting this passage in his memorandum to the Commission (Evidence, 932) states that, if it took Sir Frederick four days to march (or iwl) from the last inhabited areas on the lower forest edge to ianzini, these habitations must have been &quot;well on the Nairobi e of Limuru Station&quot; and he adds : &quot;An invasion of the forest further than Limuru by the Kikuyu did not begin, according to my information, until the advent of the Railway.&quot;

The conclusion suggested is that, while Mianzini was garded by the old caravans as being Kikuyu country in the sense-provisions could be bought here from the Kikuyu through the me tion of Dorobo, and in the sense that one had to be on gi against the occasional arrows shot by Kikuyu bowmen conee in the bush, it was not in any sense in the permanent ocenpa of the Kikuyu, andswas more in the occupation of the Dor The issue of the alleged sales of forest land will be reviews Chapter VII, but will not affect this opinion as to visible occi tion.99. The cultivation in the Lari area, now represented by Lari and Ngarariga Deserves, began some time in the period 1 to 1902.   In an article published in the Journal of the A ft-Society in 1917 the late Mr. Mervyn Beech, who was then Assis: District Commissioner in charge at Dagoretti, wrote of it :  &quot;Location (e) (about 4,000 acres) was interesting i consisted of new forest land to which the Kikuyu had s grated not more than 15 years ago.

A group) known as the Mbari ya Kiheriko has livei many years in the neighbourhood of Kfjabe Mission. It was n sented in sworn evidence before Mr. Lydekker, District Office February, 1928, that one, Ngure, the father of Kiheriko. bo land there from two Dorobo named Sutwa and Kabito, am! Kiheriko himself completed the purchase by a payment of 300
KIKUYU province the Old Kiyuyu Boundariesiit I Chapter III]316fffier goats having already been paid by Ngure. The sons of Hheriko are men in the prime of life or in early middle age and, Bice one of them attested to having seen the goats paid over, the JEnsuetion cannot be of a very remote date, although it is possible lilt Kiheriko was living there &quot;with the Dorobo&quot;, as one witness Ijs it, for several years before that payment was made. The census made by Mr. Vidal, District Commissioner, in 1928, and re-ded in the same file (Kiambu, DND.3/8) shows 71 men, 42 icn and 97 children as the descendants of Kiheriko and his fhers, and if any other natives were living there as right-holders y were so few that their names were not mentioned. Mr. Yidal&apos;s elusions after spending two days investigating the claim on I spot were as follows : &quot;It is quite clear that Kiheriko and his three brothers, Muchai, Mangare and Maina, owned a cjithaka on what is now the Africa Inland Mission land in the years before and whilst the Railway was being built . . . There is . . . very strong evidence that Kiheriko&apos;s villages, shambas and grazing grounds were all situated on their southern border . . .&quot;Whilst the construction of the Railway in this area was taking place, various murders and thefts from coolies and porters building the Railway took place probably in the years 1900 and 1901. In consequence of these the Administration, on the information of the Headman Njerogi, suspected Kiheriko and his men, and they therefore burnt a number of villages of Kiheriko and drove oil&apos; the inhabitants to a place called Kararua.&quot;101. The evidence does not suggest more than that the im-iate family of Ngure was living among the Dorobo when the way was built and possibly as early as 1895.   This family has tided, as polygamous families often do when they are fortunate, 1 in 1928 it reached, along with its dependants, the number of It docs not indicate that the land was Kikuyu country in On the contrary the implication is that it was Dorobo try.   The transaction of purchase, whatever it amounted to, not completed till afterwards.102. The forest Department map of 1909, of which a photo-hie reproduction in miniature is filed in Volume I of the original rd of the evidence, shows how very scanty was the cultivation at that date.   An analysis of it will be given later on.  Even ay a- great part of the area is virgin forest, except for the ion to which the Kikuyu began to penetrate in 1902, as Mr. h reported.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boun103. The evidence of Mr. G. S. Baker, late Assistant Co servator of Forests (Evidence, p. 652) is that there were practical no natives on the south side of the Railway between Kijabe at the Kamiti River in 1902 : &quot;From Kijabe on the south side of the railway line unone got to about Mile 357 on the Uganda Railway there w . not a Kikuyu in any of the forest.   There were a few sinshambas, probably about a dozen, south-west of Mile 355.&quot;This, taken in conjunction with Mr. Beech&apos;s statement as -the settlement of the Lari area on the northern side having start about 1902 and with Mr. Lydekker&apos;s and Mr. Vidal&apos;s investigati into the settlement on this side of the Kijabe Mission by the fat! and brothers of Kiheriko, prove that the whole Aberdarc For; between the (Southern) Chania and the Kamiti was almost free Kikuyu until after 1902.104. The same thing applies to &quot;Uplands&quot;. The Forest I partment map of 1908 shows only&apos; one village on it. It is call Muthama&apos;s. Mr. H. M. Gardner, Conservator of Forests, 1 stated in his memorandum to the Commission (Evidence, p. 9: that Mr. G. S. Baker informed him that on the south side oft Railway he &quot;only remembered one village beyond the Kija Swamp, and this belonged to a man called Muthama.&quot;105. The same is also true of the belt of farms from L. 3696 to L.O. 241/2, which juts up into the forest reserve north the Kamiti River.  Air. Gilbert, the Surveyor General, writes o cerning them in a memorandum addressed to the Commission: &quot;Re Farms L.O. Nos. 237-240, Limuru . . . The origin: survey was not carried out by me but by Air. Woodruff so years before 1913.   I was engaged on the definition of : boundary between the freehold and the leasehold portions,! as errors in the original work were revealed in the course of survey, I eventually made a re-survey of the farms, but not extend this to include L.R. No. 241 to the north.&quot;At the time of my survey the land had been clei roughly up to the south bank of the Kamiti River shown the attached print. The cleared portion still contained pate of forest but there were numerous shambas and wattle plan tons. In particular I remember a large maize shamba extei ing across the boundary line IB4-BS7 and about 200 ya northwards.&quot;To the north of the Kamiti River the forest stretc: dense and unbroken, though I recollect seeing a small clt ing about two acres in extent in L.R. 240. There may h been one or two more similar patches which escaped my do! but in an area of 100 acres they would not upset the staterc
KIKUYU PROVINCE I-Cxaiter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boundariesthat north of the Kamiti Itiver the land was still under forest. I did not survey L.Ii. 241 to the north but from what could be seen of it in the course of cutting the southern boundary and about a thousand yards to the western boundary I derived the impression that the whole of it was under dense forest.&quot;100. Before accepting the conclusion suggested it is right to nird the native evidence, and consider what weight can be corded to it.107. The total area of the Aberdare forest between the outhern) Chania and the Kamiti on the north side of the Itail-iv. together with the native reserves now contained in it and /ether with Uplands and the Africa Inland Mission and the belt of ruts to which we have referred, is 174 square miles. The claims icle by Kikuyu family groups to rights in this area have been nunarized in a tabulation (Evidence, p. 358) which shows that c number of mbaris which have made claims is 112. They repre-nt 39,597 persons now living, who are represented as either Tiav-k occupied the area as right-holders or relations in law or tenantsas being the descendants of such occupiers. Only thirty years ving elapsed since restrictions on the use of the forest were intro-.ced by the Forest Rules of 1902, it is not conceivable that the filiation can have doubled by natural increase in that time, andround figures we may say that these figures could only mean mt there, were at least 25,000 actual occupants at that time. This mild mean a density of 144 to the square mile living in a country liich is even now for the most part virgin forest.108. Only 81 of these 112 mbaris have stated the number of tits and other things which they paid to the Dorobo for the land, heir alleged payments total 39,240 goats, and other things to atch, including four girls given in marriage, and blood-money for to persons killed. If we allow for the other mbaris proportion-ely, and express the whole sum in terms of goats at an assess-ent following native custom, we should arrive at a grand totalnot less than 70,000 goats. When the total population of the iambu District was in the neighbourhood of from sixty to sixty-re thousand, are we expected to believe that nearly half of them civ occupying the Aberdare Forest or that the thrifty Kikuyu suid have paid this colossal sum in goats &quot;many centuries past&quot;even before 1895 for land which was still virgin forest in 1902 id to a large extent is so to-day?109. Much of the claim is heavily disputed by the Dorobo. he &quot;Mbari ya Choiro&quot; (Dorobo) claim 1,193 members and the Mbari ya Thungu, Gachoka, and Kingora&quot; (also Dorobo) claim 870 members. Even these by themselves are a heavier population an the forest can ever really have supported.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part 1 Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boundak110. One could go on illustrating the absurdity of these exa* gerations. But it is not necessary to labour the point. After ever allowance has been made for the probability that the same mba] may have been included under different claims and so have appeare twice in the list, we do not see how the Kikuyu evidence regardiri this area can be regarded otherwise than as a complete misreprs sentation of the facts and one is eminently justified in disregard^ it If any lingering doubt were left, the following quotations fror Mr. It. O. Preston *s &quot;The Genesis of a Colony&quot; should suffice t dispel it : From Chapter XIX.&quot;Rail-head was now fast approaching the summit of th great Kikuyu Escarpment.

Promptly our guns wrere mustere. and three of us started out after the ivory. We soon reaclie the forest and plunged right in. The great interlaced masse of branches and vines overhead made the place almost dark but on we struggled, forcing our way through thickly growirc bracken, past tall tree ferns, and network of tangled creepers We kept well together until we reached a patch of wit brambles. Flere we stuck. All attempts to get through failed but we kept at it until it seemed evident that, if we did no give in, we would return to camp in rags. We gave th brambles &quot;best&quot; and retraced our steps, making for th elephants from another direction.&quot;From Chapter XX.&quot;Approaching the Escarpment the train climbs innumer able curves through dense forest and the guard and driver ar seldom in sight of each other . . .&quot;111. Further significant evidence concerning the nature of th Kikuyu occupation in this area has been given to the commission: by Mr. Battiscombe, the Hon. Charles Dundas, Mr. A. G. Bake and Mr. Isaac. Relevant extracts are quoted in section (d) of ti, Appendix.The Forest 112. While the evidence shows that  practically evervthiniEdge North of west of the present boundary between the Chania and the Kamit the Kamiti. was forest, it does not show how far the forest extended to the ens of the reserve boundary. Practically the only evidence on the suit ject is Mr. Hinde&apos;s report that destruction of forest was goimr ot very rapidly, and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that it ex tended a considerable distance further to the eastward in 1s96 that in 1907 when the Forest Reserve was demarcated.
KIKUYU PROVINCE lin i Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boundaries113. We have now carried our boundary to the Kamiti, and my well pause at this point to consider what the Kikuyu have lined or lost in this area as the result of the demarcation of the irest boundary in 1907.114. We leave out of account the question of Kakeri&apos;s and her native settlements round Nyeri, allowing it to stand over nil we balance the account in Chapter VI. Here we consider only o Aberdare boundary.115. No compensation was paid to the natives, and the ques-m is whether any compensation was due.Ho. The case for the Kikuyu, if they were ever content to :i any case with moderation,  might  be argued by  them asHows : (1) &quot;You call it a &quot;give-and-take&apos; line on the ground that, while you took some of our clearings, you left us several patches and promontories of forest. But you cannot really regard these as a set-cff. Your only justification for taking any forest was for protecting essential water supplies, and these outlying patches were not necessary for that purpose.

The case for the Kikuyu, if they were ever content to any case with moderation, might  be argued by  them  as(1) &quot;You call it a &quot;give-and-take&apos; line on the ground that, while you took some of our clearings, you left us several patches and promontories of forest. But you cannot really regard these as a set-oil&apos;. Your only justification for taking any forest was for protecting essential water supplies, and these outlying patches were not necessary for that purpose. They were neces-sary to us and you cannot regard it as a &apos;set-off&apos; that you did not take them.(2) We therefore claim compensation for what you took in the forest the clearings where we used to graze our cattle and the trees on which we used to hang our honey barrels.

The settlement

In addition to Mr. Cox&apos;s repc Professor Gregory may be cited (&quot;Rift Valleys and Geolo^ East Africa&quot;, 1921, pp. 154 and 166);of 1893. &quot;The country, especially in Northern &quot;Pilau land was then covered by such dense forest that it was r possible to obtain a general view of the country.&apos;of 1919. &apos;One of the most startling changes between the conditions of 1893 and 1919 was that observed from i hills at Nyeri over a wide range of open downs which \ replaced formerly impenetrable Kikuyu forests.&apos;(2) The claim for reversionary interest is not likely arise, since no great confidence can be placed in the plant) of trees by the Kikuyu. If the price of wattle falls, they t not plant it, except a little for firewood.(3) It is true that a private landowner might have be compensated. But the Kikuyu were only permissive use and the extent of their use lias been compensated in the -jj-and-take&apos; line. As for amenities, the beneficial effect of i forest on climate and water supply more than counterbalare whatever amenities have been lost.(4) As to the claim of purchase, one cannot help bei sceptical when more than 40,000 Kikuyu claim rights deriv from purchase in the Aberdare and Escarpment Forests sot of the Chania.(5) The Forest Rules of 1902 were applied to an ;u extending four miles each side of the Railway from Linn to Kijabe, with the exception of Established cultivation of t Kikuyu on the east of the line from the Limuru to the L Swamp.&apos; And yet the Kikuyu went on clearing, with the re; that, when the line was cut, they got more than they wot otherwise have had, and therefore more than they deserve&apos;11.7. We consider that, on the balance of these two arguruen no injustice has been done to the Kikuyu. But the point must taken that, when Government fixed the boundary, it prevented Kikuyu from expanding in the manner which was natural to the and under the first term of reference we have the duty of provid: for their needs in some other way not necessarily as a tribe, a not necessarily by the provision of a block of land, but by provid scope for their development in the way which appears most stiita for them.Lnri; 118. There remains a further point to be considered.KHIiir^oniFour areas, which were situated in the forest, were exclm Mukoma&apos;s.       from it by the demarcation of 1907 and turned into Native Resen Three of them named Laid, Ngarariga and Kithirioni, are situa
the Escarpment Forest, which we have already found to have en practically uninhabited in 1895, except for a few Dorobo, whore joined by the famity of Ngure (now called the Kiheriko bari) and a vei-y few other Kikuyu at the time when the Railway as being constructed.   The fourth area is Chief Mukoma&apos;s, westLimuru. This is south of the Kamiti, but it is convenient to al with them all together. We are satisfied on the evidence efore us that in 1902 it was almost as sparsely inhabited as the her three.119. Between 1902 and 1907 some Kikuyu who had been dis-ssessed from lands alienated to Europeans and particularly the linuru farms began to colonize the Escarpment Forest and the nd west of Dim urn in considerable numbers. The map at the d of Volume I of the orginal evidence shows the position as was in 1907. It is a reduced copy of the map made in that year Mr. A. G. Baker, who was at that time a Forest Surveyor and ter became Surveyor General.120. The copy differs from the original in two respects : (1) A blue line has been drawn enclosing an area of 30,866-acres, which we have selected for analysis.(2) Red lines have been drawn to show the four native reserves mentioned above, which have been numbered respec-tively A, B, C and D.121. On analysis the 30,866 acres enclosed by the blue line are ound to be composed of 3,041 acres described as cultivated; 3,592 eres of grassland; 7,3S8 acres of scrub; 16,546 acres of forest, and 99 acres of swamp.   If we count the cultivated and grassland as-nd in use, the scrub as partly used, and exclude the forest and -amp, we get : -Acres.Land in use      ...      ...       ...       ...      6,633Land in partial use     ...       ...       ...      7,388Total      ...     14,021122. The whole of these clearings, except the very few existing lefore 1902, had been made in contravention of the Forest Rules-if 1902, which were applied to this area, and prohibited the cutting, lamaging or removing of any tree, timber, or grass and the pastur-ng of any stock.319KIKUYU PROVINCE j_Chapter III] The Old Kiyuyu Boundaries-
Part I Chapter III]KIKUYU province the Old Kiyuyu Boumj.mJ123. In order to prevent further destruction of forest, C--eminent concentrated the natives into the four reserves already described. The boundaries were gazetted in December, 1912. T situation in 1907 was that they contained : -A ores.......      2,580......      2,050......      2,910......      1,100110Total      ...      8,750124. The effect of this move was that the natives were give an area which, when 11163&apos; bad cleared it, would provide a k equivalent for all the cultivated and grassland which they lost, ai -also leave a balance of some 2,100 acres to be set-off against ti use which they had had of the scrub in which their goats had rui125. This was not ungenerous treatment. In spite of the it .that their clearings were mostly illegitimate, the natives were give a fair equivalent for all that they had effectively occupied. X doubt this was because it was felt that these natives, having W their lands on the Limurtt farms, should be allowed somethinci ^compensation.128. We consider therefore that when Government gazette these areas as native reserve, it amounted to a gift to the Kikuv which may legitimately be set-off against an equivalent area of t: Tjinittru farms. But we must add two qualifications. Firstly, is can he established that the Kikuyu had to make payments to tl Dorobo to secure their footing in the new area, and these paynien -exceeded the compensation which they received for the land c w7hich they were dispossessed, some allowance must be made ft that and for the additional disturbance involved. Secondly, w shall allow for the clearing which already existed in 1902. But i happens that a set-off to this has been provided by other mean; seeing that four hundred acres of the Africa Inland Mission s Kijabo has been surrendered to the reserve in order to accommodat the Kiheriko tnbari and L.O. 4450 (440 acres) has been earmarke as a further addition to the reserve. A few hundred acres in add: tion to that should be a sufficient set-off to all pre-existing interest?: before 1902 and also a sufficient compensation for any material lo; in the shape of goats paid over to the Dorobo. The extravagat -claims of the Kikuyu in regard to the number of goats paid oveCultivatedGrassScrubForestSwamp
see section 108 above) convinces us of the utter hopelessness of etting any reliable evidence on this point, and we must make up iir minds on the general probabilities of the case.127. The total additions to the Kikuyu reserve in this area,, btually gazetted or agreed and awaiting gazettement, are : Acres.These four reserves        ...       ...       ...   8,750The land ceded by the Africa Inland Mis-sion in the settlement with the Kiheriko (L.O. 388/1)      ............     400L.O. 4450    ...............      440Total   ...   9:*90128. If 1,750 acres out of the 8,750 were to be regarded as iiving been admissibly acquired by the Kikuyu by first clearing d use before 1902, and the remainder of these four native seiwes and the other two areas mentioned were to be regarded as wen, we think that such an assessment, though necessarily bitrary, would be a fair conclusion on the facts as known.In that case the area &quot;given&quot; becomes 7,840 acz-es or 12.25-quare miles.KIjvTJYU province  ._Chapter iii] The Old Kiyuyu Boundaries

Exact accuracy, however, cannot be claimed.130. The date when Count Teleki was crossing the area the neighbourhood of the present Limuru farms was from the rat ing of 13th September to the morning of 15th September, IS and extracts which will be found in section (e) of the Appen show that at all events the eastern end of the Limuru farms \ occupied Kikuyu country by IS87 and was not in the forest b It may be assumed that by 1895 there had been some fart extension of cultivation towards the west. This undoubtedly ceived a very severe check in the famine of 1898-99, which hint accounts for the fact that, when these farms were alienated, onl sparse population was found and this land had largely reverted bush.131. In a memorandum by Mr. Hobley dated 20th Febrat 1921, in Secretariat File Archives 211/Vol. 1, it is stated t &quot;compensation for actual standing crops was in a few instan paid by the landowner to the native cultivator.&quot; A register rect ing these transactions exists at Kiambu and has been examined the Commission The total amount entered, relating to the Lim area, amounts to 1,049 rupees and 4 annas, all paid between 1 and 190S.

KIKUYU PROVINCE j_Chapter IV] The Old Kikuyu Boundariesurd to the position in the eastern end of the area mentioned in preceding section this particular evidence perhaps indicatest there was not much distinction between the degree of cultiva-at the eastern and western ends.13&apos;2. While the total amount of cultivation for which com-dation was paid represents only about 1.8 per cent of the total a of the Limuru farms, it would not be right to conclude that ; was all the cultivation there was. In many cases it is probable t compensation was paid without a record being kept, and in u&apos; cases the record may have been kept in Nairobi, and there e also many cases in which the native occupier did not accept ipensation, but elected to remain on the land.133. In evidence given before us Mr. C. Pi. W. Lane points that in 1896 the land on both sides of the line between Kikuyu tioti and Limuru was occupied and cultivated by the Kikuyu.Boedeker, referring to the same year, states that occupation s on the east side only, but adds that the population north of the nuru Station consisted of a few outcasts; the land near Tigoni ? populated as thickly as the rest of the reserve, was cultivated (1 had villages; the Kikuyu had more sheep and goats than they ve now. But this population largely disappeared in the famine, d the evidence of Messrs. Impey and Hall indicates that in 1904 p population had then become very meagre.134. It would appear to be a just conclusion on this evidence at the Limuru farms were sparsely occupied by the Kikuyu prioralienation, were somewhat heavily covered with bush, but were t forest, and it is probable that, before the famine, the degree of ltivation and occupation was greater. If we attempt to trace the tier edge of the forest as it stood in 1895 we must necessarily be bitrary, but perhaps we cannot do better than draw it from the int where we left it on the Kamiti Biver in a slightly curved line the manner illustrated on the map) as far as Limuru Station d thence following the Railway to Muguga Station. This is obably a somewhat generous interpretation of the limit of &quot;un-tiivocal Kikuyu country&quot; in 1895, and gives them the benefit of ost of the points of doubt.135. Between 1s96 and 1902 there was a certain amount of niissible acquisition by honeycombing of the forest land to the tftward by a few clearings and settlements. The extent of the ea which in our judgment must be held to have been affected in is way is shown on the map by a cross hatching of yellow and &apos; on a green background, and is 4.50 square miles of country, :uated close to the Railway, between the Kamiti River and the nguga Forest.
KIKUYTJ PItOVINCE Part 1 Chapter IV] The Old Kikuyu Bou136. The evidence on which this conclusion is based i. cipally a map, Kiambu No. 1 of 1907, which shows several \ on the land leased to Mr. Kay Motiat (L.O. 176 and J 77 Dagoretti Register which shows compensation paid out native villages on that land; and Mr. Lane&apos;s evidence, refer 1896 or 1897, that there was cultivation both sides of the r from Limuru to Kikuyu Station at that time. The latter e\ does not correspond with the recollections of other witness it is evident that such cultivation as there was must tiav very sparse.The map to which reference is made above was prepare the late Mr. Justice IT. R. McClure, formerly a District Ci sioner in Kenya; a copy of it has been filed at the end of Yo of the original record of the evidence.. 137. It is fortunate that one of our number, Mr. He has personal recollection of the area as it was in 1904, ; have therefore been able to make our decision with more ce than would otherwise have been the case. We have decide this area of 4.50 square miles was, as to its general character, land, but that by 1902 there were Kikuyu clearings in ii created a Kikuyu interest, which we may fairly assess as ext over one-quarter of the whole. We therefore compute the tr sustained by the Kikuyu in this area, by reason of the subs alienation of the land, to be 1.12 square miles.From Muguga 138. It is clear from Mr. McClure&apos;s map that the land to Kikuyu       eas(; s^ig 0f the railway from Muguga to Kikuyu Static &apos;*&quot;&apos;&apos; thickly populated by Kikuyu at that date, while on the we:of the railway 32 villages can he counted, of which all but t within a mile of the railway. This might be comparable density of about 30 persons to the square mile. There can have been so many in 1896, or they would not have escap notice of Dr. Boedeker. The conflict of his evidence with t Mr. Lane suggests that occupation on the west side of the r was so sparse as not to be readily noticed. Again it will be sary to be arbitrary, and we consider that the proper cours draw a line from the south-east corner of the Muguga Reserve round the villages shown on the map until the Ne River is reached, and regard that as marking the inner foresNdeiya. 139. It will be noticed that the boundary as here deexcludes the Ndeiya grazing lands (73.76 square miles) fron equivocal Kikuyu territory.&quot; In our judgment this is quite as these lands were in Masai occupation at that time. It ready been shown beyond reasonable doubt that the countr of Limnru was more Masai country than Kikuyu, and it is fore evident that the Kikuyu could not have made use
KIKUYU PROVINCEI Chatter IV]The Oud Kikuyu Boundaries323(HIencthern part of Ndeiya. Extracts from official letters which will and in section (/) of the Appendix make it equally clear that could not have used the southern part either. In this corres-..:-e mention is made by Mr. S. L. Hiude of the fact that in a Masai stock route ran north-west near the north bank of Mbagathi River to within a couple of miles of the Sclater Road it two hours&apos; march west of Kikuyu Railway Station. This c route ran right through Ndeiya, which appears to clinch the er.140. As against this the late Mr. Mervyn Beech, when District er at Dagoretti, stated that he was prepared&apos;to produce in-table evidence that the country really belonged to the Kikuyu. not known for certain what &quot;indisputable evidence&quot; Mr. n intended to produce, but from the paper which he afterwards e for the Journal of the African Society in 1917 it may be as-ed that it related to alleged purchases of land by Kikuyu from bo.   But the cases of which Mr. Beech gives most details are in the Ndeiya area but in the neighbourhood more immediately el Dagoretti, and even those details have not turned out, when in court, to be quite as originally alleged.   The issue was d in the case of Kamani and Kitosho wa Kahoto versus Kioi Tagi in the High Court before Mr. Justice Maxwell.141It is very significant that, while almost all the land bothde and outside the reserve the whole way from Naivasha to obi and beyond it is claimed by some Kikuyu mbari or other, iya is an exception. No particular mbari claims it, but it is to belong to the whole tribe. In so far as the Kikuyu claim s of right, it is probably held by them to be included in an &apos;ed purchase by Chief Kinanjui from the Masai of a vast stretch country. This claim will be examined in detail in another place, it is enough for our present purposes to quote from Mr. Justice well&apos;s judgment in the case just cited : &quot;I am fully satisfied that Kinanjui only acquired rights to any land in this neighbourhood after the Masai-Dorobo agree-nient.&quot; (He had found the date of this to be 1899. The neigh-bourhood is Dagoretti.)142. The evidence regarding the first Dagoretti Station makes Dagoretti ami undantly clear that when it was founded in 1890 it was on t,le Neangara. extreme limit or even a little south of the extreme limit of five Kikuyu occupation.

The relevant passages are quoted iu -same section of the Appendix.143. On the weight of the evidence we are fully satisfied ti nothing south of the Neangara Eiver can be counted as having be &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory&quot; in 1895. Between 144. Dr. Boedeker has given evidence regarding the arranEortOISmithand  meuts made b? Mr- Hal1 between the Kikuyu and the Masai a the establishment of a neutral zone, and he has produced a it in illustration of it.  The impressions conveyed by the map and the memorandum attached to his evidence are perhaps at variam One gathers from the memorandum that the northern boundary the neutral zone was practically the Nairobi River. He states :-&quot;In the course of time Hall finally persuaded the Ala to cease their raids into the Kikuyu country and in order bind them to this he fixed a strip of neutral country extend: due east between the two tribes, which commenced at the he: waters of the Mbagathi stream, and then towards the he: waters of the Nairobi stream which actually had been rec nised as the natural boundary between the two tribes for ma years.&quot;It is true that the expression &quot;due east&quot; in the above passages gests that the river cannot have been the exact boundary, but; general implication seems to be that the river was the boundary practical purposes. When, however, one turns to the map, ac ferent impression is created. There a neutral zone is shown shac in a more or less uniform width and running considerably south due east, and in a footnote it is stated that it was &quot;sighted Lukenya.&quot; Nothing which was set due east in those parts coi possibly have been sighted on Lukenya, and the direction nr obviously have been south-east by east. In the western half of; neutral zone as illustrated on the map this line is in conform with the general direction of the river, but after that the river tin north-east by east, and its general direction makes an angle perhaps thirty degrees with the line of the neutral zone.145. A supplementary question was therefore put to I Boedeker, who replied : &quot;The extent of this discrepancy is illustrated by ; triangle indicated by red dots which I have now caused to put on the map. In my recollection this triangle was aim entirely covered with forest, and whether or not Mr. Ha&apos; neutral zone included it, there were no Kikuyu living or eti vating there and for practical purposes it can be included the forest belt.&quot;

It is regretted that no official account of Mr. Hall&apos;seatv&quot; has been found. We are satisfied, however, that there s an arrangement of this kind, and we consider that, whether it is made in 1891 or not till the following year, the de facto situa-i was that the Kikuyu had not the undisputed right to landth of the Nairobi Kiver and we consider it to be properly ex-ded from &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory.&quot;147. A. statement contained in a memorandum by Mr. Hobley 0. 38/1/2/12 of 20th February, 1912) provides corroborative timony : -&quot;About 1909 the Quarantine Board with the approval of Government moved all these (Kikuyu) cattle back into the reserve. The agricultural portion of the reserve did not con-tain enough grass for these cattle; so they were nearly all located in an area south of the Railway, which previously they had been nervous of occupying on account of the Masai. It was a kind of neutral zone between-een the two tribes.&quot;(lie other hand, a letter written by Mrs. Hinde, widow of Mr. nde, a former Provincial Commissioner, makes mention of Mr. 11 having fixed a boundary between the Kikuyu and Masai, ich was respected by both sides, but says nothing about a neutral e (see section (g) of the Appendix).-148. Before concluding this chapter it will be well to record opinion on Chief Kinanjui&apos;s claim to have bought land to the ith of the Nairobi River, and generally on the question whether land which is now Kikuyu Native Reserve south of the Nairobi er should more properly be accounted as won by the Kikuyu by legitimate processes of penetration, use, and possibly purchase, or having been given to them by Government.149. A summary of Chief Kinan]&apos;ui&apos;s claim is given in No. 24 the mbari claims.   It is a mass of contradictions and we are sfied that there is no substance in it.  Nor on the other hand we much impressed by the claims of various Kikuyu that they tight&quot; the land from the Dorobo Marimbe and Muinami.  It is ent from the records that the land south of the Nairobi River s generally regarded as belonging principally to the Masai until date of Mr. FfaH&apos;s agreement, and there is indeed to be found the Dagoretti Record Book a statement by Chief Kinanjni to t effect.150. It is not quite clear to us whether Mr. Hall&apos;s arrange-nt was that there was to be a neutral.zone, which neither side s to use, or whether his intention was that the Masai should Summary of the Question of Rights claimed to the South of the Nairobi River.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter IV] The Oi.n Kikuyu Bovnmjrecede and the Kikuyu advance. &quot;We have had evidence in fc, senses, but in either case it appears that ultimately the IQg were allowed to occupy land which had not previously been the and that at the time it could in a measure have been regarded a gift by Government. On the other hand we shall not deny that Kikuyu had already had a certain degree of use of the area to extent which has been revealed in the evidence reviewed in Chat II or that some family groups among them may about this ti or possibly a few years earlier have made certain payments to Dorobo for the enjoyment of certain facilities.151. We consider that, on balance, the position about thev 1902 was that the area had been subjected to considerable pcnei tion by the Kikuyu either with the definite permission or at le with the acquiescence of Government.152. But it appears that, when the alienation took place, large accretion of population in this area occurred by the immij tion of natives from the farms, and it is believed that they w able to settle there and acquire rights without much diliicn1 Chief Kinanjui apparently having constituted himself or \m been constituted as a sort of bailiff.153. On these facts our finding on the issue whether the 1: should rank as given by Government or as held by the Kikuyti a prior right, is that it must rank as &quot;mostly given.&quot;154. On the further point which arises, namely, whether area given before the alienations should be allowed to be set-ott compensation against the alienations, we consider that to so extent it can be so set-off, and after weighing the merits of claim on both sides we consider that, with the exception of: blocks to be mentioned below, half the area of the native rese south of the Nairobi River can be reckoned as a set-off agai the alienations. It has been cross-hatched blue and j&apos;ellow on map and represents an area of 7.60 square miles of which L (Le., 3.80 square miles) counts as given and half as admissi acquired.155. The two blocks excluded from this finding are show blue, and comprise a total of 1.24 square miles. The western bl was given to the Kikuyu when the Dagoretti Forest was marcated in 1907, and the eastern block was given in exeha: for certain losses in the Kabete area, including the land alienated for the Jeanes School, the Native Industrial Training Depot, Scott Laboratory, and the Reformatory. These two blocks m in our judgment, be accounted to have been added by Governn: from land which was not formerly Kikuyu territory.

The next task is to determine the point at which the S ja ^^th t cst edge crossed the Nairobi River and ran northwards, forming tliogNairobi e eastern boundary of effective. Kikuyu territory past Fort Smith River, d towards Kiambu.157. Dr. Boedeker drew on a map attached to his evidence the sition of the forest in this quarter as he conceived it to have been out 1895. Subsequently, he amended this by another line, which considered to be more correct after seeing his original line repro-ced on a large scale map, which shows more detail. According his amended line, the forest edge north of the river starts at the jth-eastern corner of L.O. 6863 (St. Austin&apos;s Mission) and then s to the north-west corner of the present Karura Forest Reserve; ence by the Karura River to the north-east corner of D.O. 4887; ence to the south-west corner of L.O. 76/3; and thence to the vih-west corner of L.O. 79, on the eastern edge of the Thathini amp. At this point it stops, since Dr. Boedeker had no personal owledge of it to the northward. This amended line is shown on e second map attached to his evidence. This line must now be mpared with the other evidence which we have on the subject, d we may first consider it where it passes to the east of Fort lith.158. That Fort Smith itself was built in Kikuyu country is Uhe is^orwt^ retain. Dord Lugard mentions in his book that he disapproved of irjaffc cf port e boma site because &quot;it was situated in the very heart of the Smith, llages and fields of the Kikuyu.&quot;159. Evidence given to the Commission suggests that the -est edge in the direction of Nairobi was not very far away from e Fort. The relevant passages are quoted in section (g) of the appendix.160. There is a notable contrast between the position depicted the witnesses whose evidence relates to the period before 1900 d that decribed by the witnesses who first came to Kenya after-rds. The allusions made by the latter witnesses to the possible stence of ground landlords is interesting and will be reviewed a later chapter, but the matter of immediate concern is the piosi-n of the forest boundary to the eastward of Fort Smith in 1895 d the limit of effective or unequivocai Kikuyu occupation. We vefore attach the mos.t importance to the contemporary evidence, d receive from it a fairly strong impression that the limit of iuyu cultivation in 1895 was at the eastern end of the Scott boratory ground. Whether the forest began immediately or some ssland or scrub country intervened is a point which remains in bt.

It is to be noted that the map on which Dr. Boedi first drew the forest line for the Commission was a contour i prepared &quot;under the direction of the Director of Surveys&quot; in 1!] and much of the area which Dr. Boedekcr included as forest bell covered on the map with the conventional signs which indii scrub.163. Dr. Boedeker&apos;s amended line includes Thimbigwa in forest.  His earlier line excluded the greater part of it.  The evidence on the conditions at Thimbigwa is Mr. Knapp&apos;s, went to live there in 1899.  He states : &quot;Mr. Krieger, who was with ine, took up a holding became owner of Thimbigwa Estate, which was then In forest . . . After the famine Mr. Krieger and I went up-counj We went north from Thimbigwa Estate and found a 1 number of clearings in the forest, which had been made in last few years. But these clearings which had been mad burning, had been abandoned in the forest, and were ( grown . . . Mr. Krieger bought the Thimbigwa Estate Kisinga for about 70 goats. I w7as there at the time and the goats handed over.&quot;This extract satisfied us that, although there were Kikuyu claimed certain rights there, the extent of which will have to! considered, the general character of the country both at Thimb and to the north of it was forest.

Evidence was given at Kiambu by Mr. MacLellan Wilson Mr. Tait to the effect that the site of Kiambu Station had not Kikuyu territory before it was taken by Government for an inistrative station.    On the other- hand the natives claim it diverse evidence has been given to the Commission as to the ticular mbari which &quot;owned&quot; it.   The Mbari ya Aigi have med it, and so have the Mbari ya Mega, who have also applied all the back rents on shops, amounting to a total of about 35.000.   Mr. Orde-Browne, a District Officer in Kenya from 9 to 1915, had an office boy named Ah who claimed it.   On the er hand it appears from a letter written by Mr. Hobley in 1913 t none of these claims was regarded by the tribe as being so ono- that the tribe as a whole could not dispose of it, and he orted that the tribe wished to make a present of it to Govern-nt.  However these things may be, the evidence of Mr. Lane nite clear as to what he found there in 1896 : &quot;Either at the end of 1S96 or the beginning of 1897 I left at midnight and went clown the valleys to what is now known as Kiambu. We took the natives by surprise and found their cattle there. Those lands in the vicinity of Kiambu were grazed over by a few head of cattle, sheep and goats, belonging to the Kikuyu. They were more on the hills.&quot; 165. Colonel Ainsworth in his memorandum mentions the aring of the site for the station in 1901.166. On general probabilities it would seem that the site of ambulance Station was scrub land in 1895, and not forest.167. Mr. Knapp stated that he and Mr. Krieger went north m Thimbigwa to Kambui through forest. The direct path would almost immediately east of Kiambu. He does not report that y emerged from the forest at any point before their arrival at mbui, but they passed a number of clearings which had been de by burning. These appeared to Mr. Knapp to have been tie before the famine and when he found them they had been ndoned and were overgrown.  He stated : &quot;Erom Nairobi to Kiambu at this time was heavy forest, but patches of it had recently been cut down.&quot;Boedeker&apos;s line is set back nearly two miles from the centre of ambulance Station. If Mr. Knapp is correct, this clearly needs endment.16S. Mr. Knapp found that on Kambui Hill itself there had a a Kikuyu village fortified for protection against the Masai, said (a point which has not been recorded by the stenographer) t the Kikuyu habitations extended for about one mile east of the ?sion. and after that there followed about four miles of stumps ofKiambu Station and Eastwards.Kiambu to Kambui.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Paiit I-Cuai-compulsory IV] The Old Kikuyu Boundarecently felled forest, and then one came to the forest itself. Knapp was subsequently recalled on this point and confirmei above statement.   The reference is to May, 1902, and iudi that in 1895 the forest edge was closer to the mission, but tha Kikuyu had subsequently destroyed more forest after the Masa left the plains.  It would be to clearing in this neighbourhood Colonel Ainsworih refers in his memoradtnn where he states: &quot;Sometime in 1895 an Elder named Ngwalu living the Ruiru River got into trouble with the District Con sioner of Kikuyu because his people had destroyed some o forest  near his village;  the District Commissioner on Ngwalu to return to his location on the higher part of the r Certain cattle were seized.   Ngwalu appealed to me as Commissioner for the return of the cattle.   Consequen proceeded with the District Commissioner to the spot, result of (he visit being that the cattle were returned Ngwalu was allowed to remain where he was on his ui taking not to cut down any more of the forest; the ] explained in all good faith that he was not aware that he doing wrong in cutting down the trees.  No claim to the was advanced.&apos;&apos;It is not in the least probable that Ngwalu or anybody else reft&apos;; from cutting more timber for the next seven years, and one conclude with certainty that the forest edge as found by Mr. K in 1902 was further to the east than it had been in 1895, but difficult to say how much further.  The fact that such an order given in 1895 is interesting, since it indicates that Governmeni already   undertaking   the   function,   which   is   inherent   in sovereign power, of ensuring that the land is used to good ad^ tage.   As we have previously stated, we have agreed to r land obtained before 1902 by first clearing and use as &quot;adnii acquired&quot; and to be accounted as Kikuyu territory.   But we not regard it altogether as legitimately won, because it is ol clear from the above instance and several others that much wa destruction of forest was carried out against the exhortation orders of administrative officers, and we feel that we are perj stretching a point in favour of the Kikuyu in counting such g  ;is their territory in 1902. After that date there can be no qtie of making further allowances in respject of any area in wl forest Officers were actively employed under the Forest Ordinal to prevent further encroachment.

Nothing of any assistance has been found.  This is perhaps surprising, as the evidence given before the Commission seems uugest a doubt whether any very obvious traces of this forest ;eT after 1898.ii. The documentary evidence is very meagre.   Count Teleki, was camped near the Thika River on 21st September, 1887, its that part of his journey ou the 22nd lay through &quot;an un-bited district&quot; and adds : Page 331. &quot;We were told that it was deserted on ac-count- of the slaving raids of the Kamba.&quot;fount Teleki states that on this day he camped at a distance &apos;about 21- to 3 miles from the wood, which seems to encircle the le district.&quot; The clear suggestion is that, if the Kikuyu had eave an area uninhabited, though situated at a distance of some s inside the boundary wood, it cannot have been a very effec-barrier in this part, and there were probably gaps in it.  Ithe noticed that the map illustrating Sir Alfred Mackinder&apos;s ney shows no forest here, but only a line where open &quot;steppe&quot; to the east is bordered by &quot;cultivation with remnants of st&quot; to the west, whereas Thomson&apos;s map of 1884 shows &quot;Highst Region.&quot;.171. Dr Boedeker states in a supplement to his evidence 701) that in 1898 he accompanied a military- expedition^from hakos into Kikuyu country, and believes they crossed the line e present Railway- in the neighbourhood of the Ndarugu River,thence they pjroceeded westwards into the Kikuyu country, y found nothing that could be called a belt of forest.  &quot;It wascountry with open grazing patches.&quot;172. On the other hand Air. J. Patterson mentions that in he and Mr. Krieger came from the direction of Kibwezi and hed Kikuyu country between Ndarugu and Ruiru Rivers, and ck a &quot;timber belt&quot;, which they followed southwards till they e to Thimbigwa. It is possible that Air. Patterson&apos;s route was ewhat south of that taken by Dr. Boedeker.

The remainder of the evidence on this point is by ? nesses who travelled at various times along the old caravan rot Their evidence in regard to this particular section of it is that t! did not see any Kikuyu. Mr. Hausburg, who made the journev 1899, Lord Phillimore, who made it in 1904, and Lord Cramvor who made it in 1906, all attest (Evidence, pp. 391, 414 and 4&apos; that they saw no Kikuyu natives and no cultivation in this r,: Mr. E. B. Home, who first made the journey in 1904, attests,; all the country from the Maragua to Nairobi, except for a lit cultivation near the Thara River, was &quot;given over to gat (Evidence, pp. 585 and 586). The evidence of Mr. R. Weeks, re! ing to 1903, is to the same effect. Dr. Arthur, in 1908, natura saw rather more cultivation, but when asked : &quot;If a witness came before the Commission and said tlin 1904 he went from Nairobi to Eort Hall and saw practicsno signs of any natives until he got to the Maragua, woyou think that was wrong?&quot;He replied : &quot;I do not think it an over-wide statement.&quot; 174. Mr. H. R. Tate, speaking of 1902, states : &quot;Prom TL on into Nairobi there was never much cultivation&quot;, but ho&apos;: not say that there was absolutely no cultivation or that the com. was quite uninhabited. Pie rather conveys the impression thai was sparsely occupied. He says : &quot;At Thika it was not den;: populated&quot;, and he speaks of his mail runners being killed, apparently by Kamba raiders.175. In view of the paucity of the facts revealed, it is diffie to suggest how the boundary of the land effectively occupied on: to be placed in this area. In most parts we have taken it to coincident with the inner edge of the forest, but here there see: to have been no forest belt sufficient to form a recognizable from; Probably the best course is to select two points which can roughly established and join them with a line of dots marked queries, and then see how such a line fulfils the known comli;:,: These two points are : (a) A point one mile east of Kambui Mission, since Mr. Km;in 1902 found the land to the eastward of that to :.been only recently cleared of forest, and the stump;the trees were still standing.

The line so set up runs at an average distance of some iles west of the Railway, and the point where it crosses the x River is 41 miles above the Railway. This line is illustrated e southern portion of the plan here following, and is marked 13.77. The claims made by the Kikuyu do not shed any light onatter.

It is clear from the European nee that them cattle did not commonly graze so far to the eastbe visible from the road, but the old road in this area ran at yerage distance of nearly seven miles east of the present bound-f the reserve. There is a certain probability in the contention , in demarcating the boundary between the Kikuyu and the available for alienation as farms, Government had respect to yu dwellings and cultivation, but not to grazing land, and they were actually in the habit of grazing their cattle consider-to the eastward. Prudence would obviously dictate that they Id not graze them so far afield as to be a temptation to the i or Kamba, but as Dr. Boedeker has remarked, there was-visibility in this region and in the daytime, when the cattleout, raiding parties could have been seen coming for miles-1 events it would be a begging of the question to assume that, jse the farm line lies where it does, therefore it accurately -s the Kikuyu boundary. There seems to be no way of deter-ng the matter except by an arbitrary process, and it appearsthe line marked by the row of dots and queries is a fair sentation of the limits to which the Kikuyu regularly used to e their cattle, as opposed to intermittent and precarious grazing hich they may have occasionally indulged when the Masai or Kamba were less aggressive than usual.8. Mr. Kazan gives evidence of having, when District Com-practitioner of the Kiambu District, visited L.O. 295, and heard the ment of the native grievance about the areas known as the

If we join that point to the other point alrt fixed further to the south, we get the rough position of the it edge of the boundary wood according to Count Teleki. If wee pare this with the map illustrating Sir Alfred Mackinder&apos;s joun we find that the line corresponds fairly closely with what is tl shown as the limit of &quot;cultivation with remnants of forest&quot;, land to the east of it being shown as open &quot;steppe.&quot;180. If we set up this line for criticism by marking it wit line of dots and cpteries, we find that it runs at an average dista of about four miles west of the present railway, but only an age of about a mile west of the present road, it is the line mat B   C on the plan above.181. This appears to agree well enough with the evide given to the Commission. If it had lain much further to thee Kikuyu occupation would have been observed by the witne who travelled by the old route, which according to Lord Cranwc (Evidence, pi- 479) passed through Punda Milia. He took up! on L.O. 83, and visited it in 1906 and subsequent years, states : &quot;There was not a head of cattle, not a goat and n native. They were gradually coming up from the west gradually approaching Port Hall . . . There were no sign cultivation to anything like the extent or anything like as as they go now, and no signs of occupation.&quot;
KIKUYU PROVINCE 1-Chaftkh V] The Old Kikuyu Boundaiues82. Mr. E. B. Home, speaking of 1904, states (Evidence, 5) :-&quot;Going south from the Maragua Biver, there was a little jultivation just before one came to the Thara, and thence on-ivards to Nairobi there was no cultivation and the country was triven over to game. I have done a lot of shooting in this area Trom Eort Hall and the only cultivation I can remember was n both sides of the river near the Thara.  I should add that r was flat country and the grass was very long and there may ossibly have been a few shambas which I did not see. Also he natives were shy in those days and did not go near any oad.   I once did a safari from Punda Milia to the Ithanga ills and I saw neither people nor cultivation.&quot;183. The evidence of these witnesses shows the conditions &apos;ning in 1904 and 1906, when the dread of the Masai had been lv removed.  We may conclude that in 1895, when conditions less settled and raids by Kamba or Masai were more frequent, ukuyu could have had no permanent use of the country be-the line which we have set up.  The more doubtful point is her they had the permanent use of all the land inside it. re we proceed to trace the boundary further north, this point be decided in relation to the whole of the tentative line which et up from a point one mile east of Kambui Mission to the l-east corner of L.O. 2,955/7 and thence to a point about a south-west of Saba-Saba Station.184. The evidence which we have been able to obtain upon abject is exceeding meagre. While we are convinced from the uce of Captain Cowie and Mr. Harries that in 1904 the lands h have been alienated in this area were practically uninhabited unused by any natives, we find a considerable degree of credi-- in the native claims that they used to graze their cattle there e the famine. Definite proof of such an allegation can hardly xpected.185. We consider that the line as set up represents what a linded man would regard as an arbitrary line drawn without r on the general probabilities of the position as it was before famine. If we a-accept it as such, the question then arises her nny reparation is due to the Kikuyu for the loss of an which they abandoned in the famine and to which they had eturned in any effective strength when the land was alienated t six or seven years afterwards.186. It is noteworthy that the claims in this area, if one ex-ts one or two which are frivolous on the face of them, tend to ade on behalf of the main clans of the Kikuyu rather than for cular family groups.   This appears to indicate that little in
Part I Chapter V]KIKUYU province the Old Kikuyu lioiajthe way of private rights had been asserted in this part and the claims related to grazing grounds held communally bj clans.   It is therefore somewhat difficult to speak of revertendi when the land was left, since no common dcsiaj well be attributed to a clan. The only way in which one can j of their intentions is by their actions, and in so far as we knowledge of the facts it seems that when the native popula which had largely gone back to the Tort Hall District in the fani began to return again south across the Chania, many of the gj sought fresh land by cutting and burning their way into the if westwards instead of returning to the places where they had! We have made very substantial allowances (altogether somel square miles) for land which we have held to have been admi -acquired by the Kikuyu in this way, and if we hold that, additions must be allowed to the 1895 boundary because of clearings, no subtractions must be made for land abandoned! should be weighing the scales unduly in favour of the Kit! This observation has all the more force when we reflect that) population had been greatly reduced in the interval, so that a traction rather than an expansion of effectively occupied terri was to be expected.187. In view therefore of the known fact that there was migration westward and southward, we shall not hold that t was anything like a settled design on the part of natives who lands on the eastern border in the famine to return to those lai &apos;but it is probable that many of them did, in fact, move pennanel -elsewhere, and had already done so before the lands which they j left were alienated.188. In the block immediately north of the Chania it is del ful whether there was much occupation even before the farnj Von Hohnel recorded that it was left vacant for fear of slave i -and, though this may have been only a temporary condition, t is no reason to believe that it was otherwise than very sparj -occupied at any time.189. Tor these reasons, although in general we have reel mended full compensation, value for value, for acreage lost toi Kikuyu, we consider that there would be no justice in such a si tion in this particular area, but we find that the fairest thing il -regard the matter as follows : 190. In the Ngewa-Chania block there are 17.10 square nf -and in the block immediately north of the Chania there are if -square miles of land which were &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu couni
I-Chapter V]KIKTJYU province the Old Kikuyu Boundaries33195, and which were alienated as farms at various dates be-ii 1904 and 1908. But in the interval between 1895 and 1904 a mine caused the abandonment of the land. In some cases the don men t was temporary in the sense that families which left and would have reoccupied it if it had not been alienated, and ther cases it was permanent in that there were families who voluntarily went and cleared fresh land elsewhere and never would reoccupied it (to say nothing of the families which had died llogether).  The fairest basis, therefore, is half and half. Let assumed that half the land occupied by these blocks (i.e. 16.26 e miles out of a total of 32.53 square miles) was land which been permanently abandoned by the previous occupiers when land was alienated, and that the. other half had only temp-ly been abandoned and that a niens revcrtendi existed to which -d must be had.191. This is an arbitrary view of the matter but, in our ion, fair to all parties, and we therefore recommend that for oses of compensation these two blocks count only as 16.27 -e miles.192. Subject to these provisions, we consider that the tentative which we set up may be accepted.193. We now come to the somewhat controversial area be- Prom Saba-ii Saba-Saba and the Maragua. The map of the reserve as it f^f to Fort ds at present shows a peninsula of farms jutting out into the ve in such a way as to suggest the suspicion that it may have formed part of native land. This is the area of the Saba-Saba194. They were surveyed in 190S by Mr. P. Bf. Jordan, who furnished a memorandum to the Commission stating that at time there were, to the best of Mr. Jordan&apos;s knowledge and f, only about 82 huts in the area surveyed by him, of which t 50 were &quot;west of Kama.&quot;195. Kama itself, and for nearly a mile west of it, is in the re, and this must be the locality he means. This leaves only nts in the farm area, and of these about 20 were found on326, which has been declared native reserve, leaving only12 huts altogether on the alienated land.Uthough Mr. Jordan found about twenty huts on L.O. 326 in Mr. Seth Smith only found about six huts there in 1906 dence, p. 937), and believes that there was only one Kikuvu on L.O. 325 (Saba-Saba Estate).L.O. 323, which was included in Mr. Jordan&apos;s survey, is n on his plan as being in the name of &quot;Hausburg, Cowen, t and Butherfoord.&quot;  Its boundary is about three miles east
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter V] The Old Kikuyl- Borx;of the Railway and about 3f miles east of the present road. Hausburg has told us in evidence, relating to 1890 : &quot;The country round Punda Milia was full of ^ Taking the old native track, which is very nearly the s to-day as it was then, there was no cultivation, so far remember, to the east of it at all. On the west side there a certain amount, increasing as you go into the foot-hill; wards Port Hall.&quot;196. Mr. Rutherfoord&apos;s evidence relating to 1904 confirms description. He informs us that he had been &quot;told that the res why there were no natives there was because the Kamba came fought there against the Kikuyu near the border of their counti197. Mr. H. R. Tate, who made his first safari from I Hall to Nairobi in 1902, stated in his evidence : &quot;There was definitely cultivation for about fifteen k south of Port Hall ... In the next stretch of march wees to Punda Milia, where Swift and Rutherfoord now are. Tt was no cultivation there.&quot;198. These extracts suggest the conclusion that even as late 1902 there was very little, if any, cultivation to the east of road until one crossed the Maragua and, since numerous witne-have stated that the Kikuyu gradually advanced their frontier e wards when the menace of the Masai and the Kamba was renioi by the establishment of settled administration, we might reas: ably conclude that the boundary in 1895 lay considerably fun to the west, and that the Saba-Saba farms were a sort of no-mat land and a battle ground between tribes. Mr. &quot;Vidal, the Disc Commissioner, goes some way to support this view in the follow passage in his &quot;Historical Memorandum&quot; (Evidence, p. 576).&quot;During the period preceding the introduction of Gove ment, and even for some years after, there was a considers amount of border warfare with the Masai on the one hand: the Kamba on the other. For this reason the Kikuyu \i unable to remain in settled occupation of outlying areas,: any advance they might make was often followed by a spe retirement.&quot;Nevertheless, he appears, in his evidence, to exclude the Saba-S; fai-m area from the scope of these remarks.  He states : &quot;This (Saba-Saba, Limited) is not a buffer state. It in my opinion, the area most likely to have been occupied the Kikuyu, at any rate intermittently, before the famine think it is a reasonable supposition that all the land whicl now Saba-Saba Limited was occupied by the Kikuyu bei
KIICUYU PROVINCE I__Chapter V] The Old Kikuyu Boundariesit. was alienated, because there is native occupation on both sides of it. It is probable, I think, that the whole of this estate was occupied by the Kikuyu.&quot;Vidal bad not then seen Mr. Jordan&apos;s memorandum, showing state of the case when he surveyed the land in 1908.199. In regard to the country eastwards, the evidence of Mr. n Boyes and of Mr. Henry Tarlton is of interest : Mr. John Boycs (Evidence, p. 725) : &quot;After leaving Fort Hall we followed the south bank of rhe Tana River to Kitui.  The whole of that plain was vacant. T met nobody, no other tribes, no one the whole way, till we met the first Kamba a few miles west of Kitui.&quot; Mr. Henrij Tarlton (Evidence, pp. 788 and 739) : Relating to 1906. &quot;At the waterfall above where the Maragua joints the Kiruruma there were a few native shambas at some distance from the river. These were, so far as I remember, the only sliambas which I had seen since crossing the Maragua on the Fort Hall road, and after them I did not see any more at all on the whole safari, though I went right, over the Yatta as far as the fly-belt.&quot;200. We find no evidence to show7 that before 1895 there was permanent Kikuyu occupation of any land to the east of the ent road between Saba-Saba and the Maragua. It will on the le be a generous interpretation of the evidence towards the tyu if we take the limit of effective Kikuyu occupation to have ted up to the road and the limit of intermittent occupation by ;ional grazing to have stretched two miles beyond it.201. There appears to be no doubt that after the Maragua had Down iac crossed, cultvation was found on both sides of the road. This Marajnia ested by practically all the witnesses. The question is how far the river it went.!02. There was a line defined by Mr. Northcote about 1913. h is known as the Northcote line. It fixed what was con-id to be the limit of Kikuyu penetration into Mwea. Its ern extremity was at the point where the Maragua flows into lagana to form the Tana, and it may be assumed that at all s by that date the Kikuyu were in occupation of all the land the north bank of the Maragua to the point of confluence, i Mr. Northcote&apos;s report, however, it is obvious that the nature e occupation was sparse, as far as huts or cultivation was con-d, although there may have been large herds of cattle at some ns of the year.
203. There is no evidence at all to show whether the Ki! reached as far as this as early as 1895. The menace of unexpc hostile attack would be slight in this area since it was protecte two considerable rivers.204. Mr. Tarlton&apos;s evidence of the condition of affairs in is interesting : &quot;In Mwea the natives were cultivating on the red gfo but there were old burnt kraals lower down than that, but as low as Boinjuki, not by some two hours&apos; march or more that time they had no cattle, and I was told that their c had been removed by Government for some reason. T had been a punitive expedition.&quot;In 1927 the Kikuyu began to raise an agitation about this and claimed that their ancient boundaries reached to the junctk the Thiba and the Tana. Mr. Champion, then District Com sioner, South Nyeri. stated that he personally saw twenty villages south of the line and 1,850 cattle. In 1928 the Dis Officer at Keruguya stated that the Kikuyu cattle were take far as Boinjuki, where there is a well-used salt-lick. This poi nearly ten miles below the Northcote line. From there the coi continues open until after Nduni Hill is passed, but becomes 1 covered as the confluence of the rivers is approached.205. That being as far as the evidence takes us, an arbi line is necessary if we are to be in a position to make any &quot;1 and Loss&quot; account of the Kikuyu lands. The history indica progressive advance south-eastwards, and it is probable that in the Kikuyu had not yet penetrated to the point where Northcote set his hue in 1913. But we may perhaps stret point in then&apos; favour and find, in order to form a basis of ai ment, that they had reached this point, to the extent that they regularly grazing them cattle there. It is also possible that sometimes drove them to the salt lick at Boinjuki&apos; beyom Northcote line, but in other respects it is unlikely that they any use of that area in 1895. By 1902 we are prepared to bi that they were making intermittent use of it, and in so concl we rely largely on the evidence of Mr. Henry Tarlton (evidence pp. 737 to 740). But the weight of the evidence is against tht position that the use made of the area between the Northeot and Boinjuki was more than intermittent and partial. Ther in making up the &quot;Profit and Loss&quot; account we have decided to this area partly as &quot;admissibly acquired&quot; by use and part given by Government, and the proportion on which we hai cided is half and half.

The extent of the land in the area below Boinjuki, the lower part of Mwea, is 143 square miles and this will rank Uy as given, making in all 174.45 square miles which rank as n.206. We need not concern ourselves particularly with the ndary from Mwea northwards, seeing that it is simply the linistrative boundary between the Kikuyu and the Embu. The hugu Division used to be counted as part of the Embu District,in 1922 it was transferred to Nyeri and thereafter ranked as -uvu. This may be counted as an access of strength in a politi-sense to the extent that the tribe gained something in numbersprestige, but can hardly be called an addition of territory in an arian sense, since it was not a gift of land to the Kikuyu.207. In order not to complicate the issue unnecessarily it is i of ore better to show the present boundary, the Rupingazi, as t had always been the boundary between the Kikuyu and the Ira. This boundary begins at the point where the Kii River ich afterwards becomes the Rupingazi) emerges from Mount nya Forest Reserve and goes south by this river to the Thiba.208. It is quite impossible to say how much the natives have The Northersback the forest boundary all along the north part of the Keru- Boundary baeKto  &quot;svcna Sub-District between 1s96 and the pxresent.  Since the natives     * &apos; are not so crow-ded as in the Nyeri District proper, and havele land in Mwea for grazing, there is a probability that they e not destroyed the forest quite so ruthlessly.   Nevertheless,mile would probably be a very conservative estimate.209. The only other matter which requires mention is the Wangombe&apos;j tion of the former location of Wangombe, the father of Head-Nderi, who has written a memorandum to the Commission.there stated that Wangombe was a chief living on the borders he Kikuyu country near a place called Thathwa, which is ap-jmately the site of Nyeri Railway Station, and that, a little re Nyeri Township was founded, he offered Thathwa to Gov-tent as a site for the township, as being a convenient site near Kikuyu-Masai border and near the Amboni River.210. Soon afterwards Wangombe died and is said to have left yirig instruction to his son Nderi to move to a place called aaha between the Muringato and Mwiga Rivers, where he ised to have had his ngundu (right-holding).   Nderi moved tolormsr Location.

He was then moved to his present location of Kaiuai; and complains that he had no proper footing there, since ii us right-holding of another man, named Ngatia \va Mahenia.-211. In considering what the boundary was in 1895 we not concerned with these later developments, but only with situation as it then stood, when Wangombe is stated 1.0 ; lived near Thathwa and to have had a right-holding between: Mwiga and the Muringato.212. There seems to be no doubt that the place wfc Wangombe&apos;s village stood was on the south side of Niana R It is so shown in the map illustrating Sir Alfred Mackindi route. And it is quite clear from Mr. John Boyes&apos; account thai was not actually in the forest, hut on those slopes of the hiil wi, commanded a good view southward. He writes in his book ij.. 146) :-&quot;Wangombe&apos;s kraal was right at the top of a suial mountain which rises at the foot of Mount Kenya, and fa this vantage ground a splendid view could be obtained of 1 country for many miles around . . . Spread out as far as: eye could reach was a panoramic view of the Kikuyu count lb rough which I had travelled.&quot; Niania Hill is just inside the gazetted forest reserve, being situs between the points marked B2 and B3 in the sketch on page of the evidence.   Since the boundary of the forest reserve follow the actual forest edge very closely, it appears clear that Wangoml was living on the very edge of his own clearings and that the at; in which he had effectively established himself lay between the and Thathwa, which is the approximate site of Nyeri Raik Station.   He was, by general report, a powerful chief, as Kita chiefs went in those days, and his followers probably number, some thousands (cf., John Boyes, pp. 158, 159), and it is probably that the whole area now in the reserve between these two poin was effectively occupied by them.  But there seems to be no evii ence that any significant portion of their occupied territory it cut off when the boundary was made.213. The place to which Nderi removed at his father&apos;s dyin request was between the Mwega and Muringato Bivers, and tit doubtedly outside the reserve as it now exists. But no argumet has been advanced to show that the locality was in any real .w a right-holding. Evidence already cited shows that it was in it forest belt. It was near Mathari, &quot;the (dace of dividing&quot;, ah reference may again be made to the file of Nyeri Revision Case! 23/29, which shows the conditions prevailing in the neiehta hood.  There is no evidence of Wangombe having ever establish
it to his rigundu in this area by means of clearing and use. t is admitted that he was not living there. There is clearly no d for showing this.as unequivocal Kikuyu territory in 1895.14. With the possible exception of the southern and eastern a Genera!of Niana Hill, there appears to be no ground for claiming that Commentf the land now contained in the Mount Kenya Forest Reserve boundariesver effectively occupied Kikuyu territory, and the same thing es to the northern boundary of the reserve generally.14. (a) We have now completed our survey of the Kikuyu The 1885 daries.   The results, summarized in terms of acres, will be &apos;Sounuary-1 in the next chapter and are illustrated in the coloured mapi follows it.   We wish, in this place to make some generalents.he area shown with a plain yellow background and sur-ded by a deep yellow line is the area which we have found tobeen &quot;unequivocal. Kikuyu territory&apos;&quot; in 1895. When it is r:ed that, except in a very few places where some sort of anment existed, the limits of the Kikuyu country at that dateentirely undefined, it will be understood that our decision has ecessity been arbitrary. We have attempted to draw a line d on such evidence as is available and offering as fair an inter-tion as is possible at this date.In a few instances, after our line had been drawn, further consideration has suggested to us that perhaps we have been a little -generous in one quarter and perhaps not sufficiently generous bother, and we are inclined to think it probable that our draw-of the line in the neighbourhood of Limuru Station is a little -generous to the Kikuyu, while in the neighbourhood of Kambui ion Station we have not pierhaps allowed as much to the yu as we might have done. Further north, in the Ngewa-ia area, we think that we have again erred on the side of rosity. But, taken all in all, we regard the boundary as fair, gh if anything on the generous side.In reaching our decision our principal sources of information been: books, maps and records; the evidence of European als and non-officials whose experience of the country is of long ding; and the native evidence.   Our conclusion in regard to vidence given by the Kikuyu is that what they claim and what really occupied are two very different things, and we say edly that, with few exceptions, very little reliance can be d on their statements.  As an illustration of the readiness with h the Kikuyu commit themselves to wildly inaccurate state-ts without making any attempt to ascertain the true facts, we tion that two representatives of the Kikuyu Central Associa-giving evidence before us at Kiambu complained that theKIKUYU PROVINCE j_Chapter V] riIE ^*LU Kikuyu Boundaries

CHAPTER &quot;VI.THE PEOPIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT.215. It should be clear from the foregoing chapters that, while &apos;rst care has been to ascertain the boundaries as they existed the Protectorate was declared, we have not denied to the yu the right to count as Kikuyu country land admissibly red by them by a process of clearing and first use between that and 1902. But we have required to be satisfied that the clear--as sufficiently intensive to represent an extension of the tribal ier rather than the isolated effort of a few venturesome in-actuals, and in the second place that the extension did not ge any general order of Government made by proclamation rmal notice, which was being effectively enforced. 216. Our findings are illustrated in the maps which follow this ter.   The first shows the situation as it exists to-day, and is urpose of comparison only.  The second shows : (1) Areas coloured plain yellow, which represent land which was unequivocal Kikuyu territory in 1895 and is still in Kikuyu occupation : 1,519 13 square miles.(2) Areas marked in red hatching over a yellow back-ground, representing land which was Kikuyu territory in 1s96. but was subsequently alienated. After reckoning in a few small mission stations in the reserve which are held on freehold but which are too small to be marked, we find the total of this area to be 120-64 square miles, and for the purpose of the table which follows, it has been split thus : Taken by Government        ..       . .       . .    104-38Lost by abandonment        . .       . .       . .     16-26 (Sfe Section 190)Total   . .    120-64&apos;otc. The total of this and the previous category (i.e., 1519-13 phis 120-64) up the total area which we find to have been &quot; unequivocal Kikuyu territory&quot; 5 approximately 1,640 square miles.(3) Areas barred j7ellow which represent land admissibly required by the Kikuyu between 1895 and 1902 by a process f clearing and first use, and conceivably in some cases by urchase added to clearing and use. This area is 11P17 square iles.(4) Areas in the Kiambu District marked in yellow and lue parallel lines which represent land given by Government tit in which the Kikuyu had already gained a footing by artial clearing and use before it was given by Government. The part of this land ranking as admissibly acquired by the vikuyu is 1,750 acres, or, 2&apos;74 square miles.   And the part

KIKUYU PROVINCE j__Chapter VI] &quot;The Profit and Loss Account&quot;Note 1. The expression &quot;Legitimate Kikuyu Territory&quot; is to understood as covering : (a) land which was effectively Kikuyuitorv when the Protectorate was declared; and (b) land admis-y acquired by the Kikuyu since that date until 1902 by a process first clearing and use. The expression is merely used for venience, and is not intended to imply that &quot;land added byeniment&quot; did not equally become legitimate Kikuyu territory.itimate acquisition of fresh land by a process of first clearing use is held by us to have ceased in 1902 in areas in whichers of the forest Department were actively employed and inr places after definite areas were demarcated as forest reserve.The deep yellow line on the map) shows the limits of legitimate ivu territory in 1895, but all the area between it and the broken n line was mainly forest or scrub covered in 1895, and to a siderable extent was still so covered in 1902.The total of 1,794&apos;05 square miles is somewhat greater than area which we have found to have been Kikuyu territory either 895 or in 1902 because in 1895 the items under categories (3), (5), (6) and (8) had not yet been acquired, while by 1902 an of 16&apos;26 square miles had been lost by abandonment as shown er category (4).  This figure is not significant for the purpose of ssing the Profit and Loss Account, which will be balanced on valuations of the land &quot;added by Government&quot; and &quot;taken ay by Government.&quot;For the prarpose of working out the population density in 1902 section 63 above the extent of Kikuyu territory has been shown .778 square miles (i.e., 1,794 less sixteen abandoned).Note 2. In the above table three assumptions have been made eh are true as regards the facts as existing on the land, but are icipations as far as gazetting is concerned.(i) The gift of Mwea to the Kikuyu has been approved by theGovernor in Council, but owing to legal difficulties in conveyance the gazettement has not yet been effected.(ii) L.O. 4,450, which is included in category7 (4), was origin-ally set aside to be forest reserve, but was abandoned by the Forest Department for the reason that it was not required for afforestation, and also because there was considerable native occupation in it. Major Gray, when District Commissioner, Kiambu in 1927 informed the natives that they would be allowed to remain, and they have been in undisturbed possession ever since. It is now occupied and cultivated as intensively as the rest of the reserve. Since we do not conceive that there is any in-tention of disturbing these natives, we have assumed

While the above analysis is set down for the general -est which it possesses, we do not propose to concern ourselves his chapter with any other considerations than a settlement the tribe at large.   The question whether any settlement ch we find to be just to the tribe as a whole requires modifica-in the interests of particular districts or individuals, is held to be considered in Chapter IX, in which we give our con-ions on the settlement of private rights, and it will be found a certain degree of modification  is recommended on this unt.220. Another important consideration which will affect the unt is the question whether and to what extent exceptions can mde to the general recommendation of equivalent compensa-in land in special cases, as for instance when the land taken lovernment has been developed as a mission or in some other ner directly beneficial to the natives. This is a matter which be covered in Chapter X, which will also deal with the question xchange and other adjustments.-221. It is clear to us that the basis of valuation must be the e which the land possesses for natives. But the native view-t and their agricultural and pastoral practice are changing and question arises whether we should consider the value which the possessed for the Kikuyu at the time of the alienations or the e which it would have for them now, or the value which :&apos;. have for them in time to come. The importance of the point isily illustrated by considering the Limuru farm area. When alienations occurred this locality was not much favoured by ves, since it was too cold and misty to be very suitable for the s which they were accustomed to grow. It would have ranked heir eyes then as low average land. In later years many have t to plant European potatoes and other crops more suitable ich a climate and they would regard this land as good average vikuyu country.222. In the bare justice of the matter we consider that we ought gard the present. The question of what the natives have been hat they may one day become does not appear to concern this of our argument and we have to deal with them as they are. e economic sections of our Beport, wdien we are considering the s of natives, we shall have to take account of future vicissitudes.223.

KIKUYU PROVINCE j r__Chapter VI] &quot;The ,Ijkofit and Loss Account&quot;224 The details of our valuation of these areas have been set n in Appendix No. 4. The result of it is that we have assessed total value of these 265*50 square miles to be equal in exchangeie to 79 square miles of good agrieuirura. land of the Kiamburage.225. It therefore appears that, so far as our inquiry has -ied us at present, the balance of loss sustained by the Kikuyu bout 30J square miles of good agricultural land or about 19,520 es. But the modifications which we shall have to recommend consideration of private claims, exchanges, and special cases be very considerable, and this chapter has only been written order to summarize some preliminary calculations before pro-ding to consider the nature and effect of these modifications, and final account will not be balanced until Chapter XI.226.

CHAPTEE VII.AN EXAMINATION OP PRIVATE RIGHTS AND CLAIMS-(PART 1). The Historical Basis.228. This chapter will be devoted to an examination of nature of private land lights among the Kikuyu, in so far as; affect the issue with which we have to deal. The point at isst whether the Kikuyu claims of right can be equitably settled [ simple squaring of the Profit and Loss Account summarized it, last chapter, making block additions equivalent to the balanc, loss. If this is done, will it fulfil all the requirements of an eq able settlement, or is it open to the objection that the Kikuva not hold land as a tribe, but as individuals or family-groups, might not be adequately compensated for loss individually . tained by a simple addition of land to the tribe as a whole? 1 first essential in approaching the question is a just appreciatio; the facts.229. In the present survey we shall concern ourselves chit with the Kiambu District on account of the greater complexin its problems, and our findings will be based upon the evidence on the documents to which we have had access.230. By far the most important document on this subjee: the report of the Committee of 1929 on Native Land Temm Kikuyu Prbvince.  It has not been possible for us, during ther at our command, to conduct a general inquiry into the Kit system of land tenure and we therefore accept that report as most authoritative document available, and no cause has been vealed why we should doubt its main conclusions.   But there certain aspects of the matter into which it did not concern t Committee to conduct so complete an investigation as will be nec sary for the purposes of our Report.  One of these is in connex with the alleged sales of land by the Dorobo.231. The 1929 Committee was only concerned to investig-the system or systems of land tenure prevailing and to make reco mendations. Having satisfied themselves that the system of tem in southern Kikuyu was based on a tradition of purchase from t Dorobo, and that transactions had taken place which sufficien resembled a purchase to provide a substratum of fact for the tra tion, they set themselves to examine whether the system, so bas could be developed into a workable method of land tenure for t
KIKTJYU 1&apos;HOVINCE[ill   I G&apos;HAI&apos;rTEtt   vii]Private Rights and Claimsfoe. Beyond that point they were not concerned to investigate e exact truth of the alleged sales. This is made clear in section ! of Chapter 1 of their report, in which they write : &quot;We need not examine the exact implication of the claim that they &quot;bought the Dorobo out.&quot; It is at least certain that payments were made, and that Kikuyu families are the un-disputed successors in the occupation of areas over which Dorobo families once hunted. This, which is all that is im-portant to our purpose, is common ground.&quot;-232. This Commission is differently placed. Statements have :n made by nearly 200 claimants purporting to represent about b mbari or family groups, that the founders of those groups hight land as private estates from Dorobo, of which they allege L Government has deprived them without adequate compensa-ii. The tribe as a whole has asked in baraza that any compensa-n which may be granted to it should take the form of land, and have to decide whether it is just or practicable to recommend U any land which might be added to the reserve on that account ould be devoted to the accommodation of the particular mbari lich have been dispossessed.233. The issues in the question appear to be :  (i) Were payments made to the Dorobo? If so, when? And wdiat, in general, were the amounts?(ii) What was the nature, intention and effect of these pay-ments ?(iii) To what extent had the &quot;githaka system&quot; developed atthe time when the alienation of which the Kikuyu corn-plain took place?234. In view of the fact that so many family-groups have -yyere ted that they bought land from the Dorobo, and in most cases Payments re supplied details of the payment down to the last pot of honey, 5jade.    the may seem strange that the answer should be in doubt.  But the    oro 0&apos; ijority of the claims are so wild and extravagant, and frequently conflicting, that not even the Kikuyu could criticize us for re-iring substantiation from other sources before we affirm as a :t that any practice of making such payments existed.  To this i we have caused a search to be made among the records of ithaka&quot; cases at Kiambu, and frequent references to payments Dorobo have been found.   But in a considerable proportion of !m there is some complicating circumstance, such as the marriage a girl or an adoption ceremony or the payment of blood-moneya man slain, so that it is difficult to say whether any payments ich may have been made were in respect of land or in respect these other circumstances. There are, however, several cases in ich both parties have agreed that a sale took place.

It does not, of course, follow that the payments w made because the parties have agreed to say so; still less thai t amounted to a purchase of land. That niay be only an inter;r tion which they have put upon obscure happenings which t place before they were born.236. We are more disposed to believe the story when \ve it corroborated by the Dorobo. Turuthi, the Dorobo Elde lives near Kijabe, and Wanjugu, a son of the well-known 1 Elder, Marimbe, are important witnesses, and both of them admitted that sales occurred. Turuthi stated in a memora sworn before the District Commissioner, Kiambu, and for w to us : &apos;&apos;I agree that we sold land to the Kikuyu tribe&quot; Wanjugu stated : &apos;*My father had much land years ago. He s] much of it.&quot; Even the witness Kinara Kimenye, who appear; dislike the Kikuyu intensely, admitted that his father began, to j some land and received thirty goats, although the transaction t never completed. Njengwa and Kabanga Kubai are others * admitted to us that their Dorobo grandfathers had sold land. 0; admissions of the kind have been found in Kiambu files, althoti as will be shown later, the alleged payments are often complica by other considerations, so that one hesitates to accept the ft section unquestionably as sales.237. While we accord considerable weight to this evidei we make the observation that, with the exception of Turuthi, these witnesses are the sons or the grandsons of persons who \i adopted by the Kikuyu, and are probably at least half Kikuv blood and more than half Kikuyu in interest. Even Turuthi appeared to us to have identified his interests with those of Kikuyu.238. The investigation by the late Mr. Mervyn Beech, n when he was District Officer at Dagoretti and printed in Journal of the African Society in 1917, adds only a few point fact to what we have from other sources. He mentions a Dot named Goitiba as being a surviving witness to a sale of lam his father, Gathagu, who may be the man mentioned in Claim 11 (Mbari of Mwenda). He also mentions that about half location of about 17,000 acres was bought from Marimbe I Kikuyu named Gitu for &quot;500 oxen, sheep and goats.&quot; Ha regard to the manner in which the Kikuyu are accustomed to re and speak, we have no doubt of the meaning of this phrase meant oxen, sheep and goats to the equivalent value of 500 ; by Kikuyu reckoning, under which an ox is reckoned as five * It is therefore instructive to find that in Claim No. 30 it has stated to us that Gitu bought land from Marimbe for 3,700 t? 370 rams and an assortment of other things.
KIKUYU PROVINCE T i_Chapter VII] Private Rights and Claims239. This inconsistency is by-no means exceptional and we h to draw particular attention to the fact that, whenever it has u possible to take a statement made to the Commission concern-the number of goats paid and compare it with previous ements made by the same party before the Commission was pointed, the statements have been found, in practically every e, to be utterly discrepant. Some examples of this will be ted in a later part of this chapter.240. There is little evidence of fact from European sources, etter has been produced in evidence, written by Mr. E. Watson 30th November, 1897, to Mr. W. P. Alexander, in which it is ed :-&quot;Unlike Ukambani all the land here is privately owned by some one or more of the natives, and now they have learned to demand high prices for land compared with what they thought of two years ago.&quot;The context shows that Mr. Watson was looking for a piece and to buy on behalf of the Church of Scotland Mission. It is bable therefore that his remark refers to prices which the ives required from Europeans, and that there is no reference e to any sales between themselves or purchases from theobo. On the other hand the letter would appear to indicate t the natives had already assimilated the idea of buying land, &apos;ch may be a sign that they themselves had experience of it.241. In August, 1899, Mr. Justice Cator wrote : &quot;It has sometimes been asserted that the Kikuyu acknow-ledge individual ownership of land, but I have heard this view contradicted and I am disposed to think that there is no in-dividual ownership, but that the chiefs, when strong enough, assume to themselves the right to sell such land as is not actually required by the inhabitants of the villages over which they rule.&quot;s letter is preserved in the archives of the Secretariat (S. 211, . D.242. Mr. John Boyes mentions in his book that he had been by a Kikuyu Headman, named Karuri, who is believed to have of mixed Kikuyu-Dorobo blood, that the Kikuyu had &quot;pur-sed tracts of land from the Athi for purposes of cultivation.&apos;.&apos; adds : &quot;Karuri himself based his strongest claim to the chief-cy on the fact that he1 was a direct descendant of these Athi.&quot; his evidence given to us at Nyeri, Mr. Boyes stated that this rmation was given to him at the time to which the book relates, ely, 1898.  It is perhaps the earliest record of the story of the obo-Kikuyu land sales having been told to a European.  It is
Private Uiohts and CU:noteworthy- that Karuri lived iu Fort Hall District, and thai Fort Hall natives denied in baraza before the 1929 Committee t they had ever bought any land from the Dorobo in that district!243. As the claims from the Kiambu natives have reached if Commission they have been marked on a map.  In most cases; descriptions given have been good enough to permit of their hc. marked with reasonable accuracy.  A great number of conflict; claims have been revealed. If these lands really have been bom we cannot understand why so many claims exist to the same la. When every allowance has been made for possible mistakes recording the claims on the map, we cannot escape the conclus that there is very little land which has not been made subject! at least two claims.   The total number of persons alleged to I members or dependents of the family groups, affected by the alieJi tion of land to settlers in the Kiambu District is greater by ml than 50 per cent than the total population of the Kiambu Nat Deserve !   These considerations seem to us to cast doubt on contention that these lands were originally bought as private estai from the Dorobo.244. Another point which strikes us as remarkable is til while most of the transactions resembling sale which have b* corroborated by the Dorobo appear to have taken place about i decade 1891-1900, the administrative officers of that date left record of them.   And it is still more remarkable that in the m decade, when the alienations under complaint took place&apos;, nothi seems to have been recorded or known by anybody about Doe selling land or the existence of ithaka.   If ithaka were priv estates in the sense which is now claimed, it is hardly crediblef the Kikuyu should have received compensation for their sham on the Limuru farms at the hands of Mr. Hope and others and; nothing to him about githaka rights.   And yet Mr. Hope appe] never to have heard of them at that date, and -certainly reported their existence.245. It appears that in later years, when he learnt more abi the manner in which the Kikuyu held this land, he regrettedt ing recommended so much of it for alienation (vide Evidence Mr. Wade, Chief Native Commissioner, pp. 2934 and 2935 of: printed evidence and quoted in section (e) of Appendix No. 1). T: is perhaps evidence that he discovered landholding in Kikuyu to more private in character than he had realized, but by no m amounts to an admission that ithaka were private estates in&apos; sense which is now claimed. There is nothing to show that gave any credence to the story that they had been bought&apos;&apos; the Dorobo, or even that he had heard it.iaicuYU intoviNCBPart 1-Chapter VII]
KIKUYU PROVINCEI-OHMTKIt VII] PltlVATJi RIGHTS AND Cl/AIMS246. The question of githaka rights first appears as an issue government files when it was raised by Mr. Hobley in 1913, Ireapon their existence was hotly disputed for several years, lav they are generally believed to exist, but lingering doubts (remain as to whether they amount to a &quot;system.&quot;247. We have taken due notice of the views recorded by dous inquirers and the evidence on which they were based. We b oiven due weight to the unanimous and probably sincere lion of the Kiambu natives, expressed in several barazas, that I bought their land, and we have also noted on the other side (statement made to us by Chief Nduini, at Nyeri, jorotesting I any Kikuyu who said he had bought land from the Dorobo was Iiii.&apos;24H. Ail that we regard as a safe finding on the evidence re-led up to this point is that there have been instances of Dorobo living payments from Kikuyu, which related in some degree touse and management of land. Whether these payments were innovation or instances of a general and established practicequestion which we hold over until our review of the evidence L the further issues has been completed.249. The next question is the date of the payments. The cases which corroborative evidence has been given to us by Dorobo [relate to comparatively recent dates. The alleged sales by uthTs section in the Lari and Escarpment Forests are almost airily since 1900, seeing that these areas tire known to have i to all intents and purposes virgin forest until 1902. The once before us is that payments were not made in a- lump sum that the Kikuyu paid as the work of clearing proceeded, and efore we cannot credit that the Kikuyu paid much in advance anything which they had not yet used.250. For the same reason the sales by Marimbe of land south le Nairobi and Neangara rivers cannot have been much before , at which date the land was still virgin forest, nor much after . which was found by Mr. Justice Maxwell (in a judgment ,dy quoted) to be the date of the Masai-Dorobo agreement, by the Dorobo were to abandon the land south of the Nean-River.251. None of the other sales for which we have corroboration le Dorobo can be dated with certainty before 1890, although iof them may have been before then. The same thing applies e cases examined by Mr. Beech.152. An examination of Native Tribunal Records tends to con-the view expressed in the Report of the 1929 Committee that tiginal Kikuyu purchasers were the fathers and grandfathers of

The bulk of the Kikuyu claims before the commonwealth to the effect that particular family groups have lost hands of the Government, which they had bought from the Do Many of the claimants have submitted their statements on a pa] form, which represents the transactions with the Dorobo as h happened &quot;many centuries 2^ast.&quot;   We are fully satisfied or! evidence that there is nothing whatever to justify this antiquity. We believe that most of the witnesses filled in the without any clear knowledge of what the phrase implied, ai describing their claim they often stated quite frankly that it they themselves or their fathers or their grandfathers who ducted the transactions. Where it has not been stated in so: words, the inference is clearly suggested in the claim. Indei we had nothing else to guide us but the evidence given us b Kikuyu mbaris, we should have to conclude that most of the now under claim and the bulk of the Kiambu Native Reserve in the ownership of Dorobo landlords as late as 1880 and thai Kikuyu then began to buy the land, but that it was still I largely Dorobo in ownership wdien the Protectorate was clcclar 254. Fortunately for the Kikuyu we are not entirely depei on their evidence. We know that when Count Teleki went tin the country in 1887 he found them firmly established in the co traversed by him after he crossed the Nairobi River until he to the Gura.  He says that Kikuyu appeared at practically stream which he crossed, demanding hongo (tribute) and not remember that he mentions the presence of Dorobo any] in that piece of country.   We cannot bring ourselves to bl that, if such a thing as land-ownership were ever mention! those days, the Kikuyu had not already secured the principal in it.255. We are therefore faced with the puzzle that, whi Kikuyu statements, if accepted, would suggest that most &apos; land was bought after 1880, Count Teleki&apos;s description country makes it almost certain that the Kikuyu must havd in occupation for at least a generation before that. This another reason for doubting the story of these &quot;sales&quot; as t the Kikuyu.
KIKUYU PROVINCE I-Chapter VII] - Private Rights and Claims256. We shall proceed with the examination of further evidence-before recording what we consider to be the truth of the er.   We  can   only   say  here  that  the  only  transactions lbling sale which are sufficiently well attested to be accepted acts, that is to say, the transactions corroborated by the 1)0, appear to have taken place&apos;about the period 1891 to 1S99. do not therefore provide any answer to those who hold the that the idea of outright sale of land was foreign to the native until the Europeans appeared.57. The Kikuyu evidence suggests that the payments were ^^erJll ly live stock and honey, with an axe, a knife, and a branding- wero the to honour the custom.   It is admitted that girls were some- amounts of the s included, and, in a few exceptional cases, the blood-money 1,ayments?man slain.258. The total number of claims made is 193, inclusive of in claims by the Dorobo.   There are 141 cases in which the i is accompanied by a statement of the payment alleged to been made.  The average payment, according to the claims, s out at 1,779 sheep and goats, 180 rams, 19 fat rams (or he-s or ewes), 22 cattle and a number of other things, while the le total of recorded payments is 250,849 goats, and the rest to li.   We regard these  figures as fantastic and ridiculous, thor one looks at them from the standpoint of the number of s that the Kikuyu are known to have possessed, or the goat-mning-eapacity of the Dorobo, or compares them with the lents recorded in Native Tribunal cases.  A few instances may aken : -Claim No. 13. It is stated that the mbari of Thaara bought land from a Dorobo named Ithiru for 180 sheep and goats, 18 rams, 10 ewes, 10 knives, 9 axes and 10 pots of honey. In District Officer&apos;s Revision Case No. 42 of 1921, Kagone wa Ithara sued Gethungiri wa Thiru and stated : &quot;Thiru, the father of the defendant, sold me a githaka during the great famine for 30 goats and 2 sheep.&quot;President of the Dagoretti Native Tribunal explained : &quot;We awarded the githaka to the plaintiff on his paying I goats. We decided in this way because Thiru paid a goat tany years ago to Kagone.   Kagone returned one to him.The goat paid by Thiru produced 30.  Thiru took the githakafor the goat during the great famine.&quot;259. This case is very illuminating, for though we do not ss to understand its details, it would appear that all that was tally paid by Thiru (or Ithiru) was one goat, which produced more, and the Kiania eventually ordered him to pay eleven

Wangugu, son of Marimbe, is that their fathers, Marimbes Muinami, sought adoption by Kihara, because one of ft brothers had been killed by the Kikuyu, and they were afn On adoption they were given ten goats each and had to s render a large amount of land.Claim No. 106. The claimants state that they boo the land from four Dorobo including Kimenye Munyugi for cows, 1,800 goats, 140 rams, etc. The son of Kimenyi sti that only 80 goats were paid and that the sale was not effectClaim No. 137 (Mbari of Chiri).

It would be easy to go on multiplying instances. 1 evidence is on record to be examined by- any one who wishes study it in detail, and a precis of it has been printed (since i; too voluminous to print in full.) After studying the evidence; mitted by natives in support of the mbari claims, we have no hesi tion in characterizing the bulk of it as worthless.  We go fur::
KIKUYU PROVINCE VII] Private Rights and Claimsoay that in our opinion many of the memoranda are deliberately nthful.261. We wish to invite especial attention to the fact that on occasion, Headman Philip Karanja, who was representing ve interests before us, asked leave to interrupt the proceedings the purpose of warning witnesses not to go on telling lies t the number of goats paid.262. In a sworn statement made recently to the Magistrate at lbu, the Dorobo Elder, named Turuthi, said : &quot;The prices varied according to the size of the githaka. The lowest price was 30 goats, going up to 300 or more . . . As we did not herd, the goats paid by the buyer would be taken by us to a relative, that is, to a Kikuyu into whose family we had married and he would herd them. As we required meat we would go and get them . . . Sometimes a girl was given, or even two, as the buying price. I have never myself heard of more than 300 goats being paid. I do remember now Karuri paid 400 goats for some land.&quot;the other hand an elderly Dorobo witness stated that his father land for 7,000 goats before he was born; that the payments e by instalments, and that he saw the later stages of the pay-t. When questions of detail were put to him he became vague, kept to the figure of 7,000.263. Some of the Kiambu Native Tribunal cases help to shed t on the matter : Central Tribunal Revision Gases.Case No. 10/30 (from the judgment). &quot;Seventy goats were paid as blood-money to Waraga (defendant) and the land in dispute was handed over instead of 30 goats balance.&quot;Case No. 17/30 (from the judgment). &quot;One githaka had been secretly\sold by plaintiffs brother Muturo for 9 goats.&quot;Case No. 48/30. Defendant stated that lie bought the githaka from the Dorobo for &quot;my daughter and 50 goats and one man who meet the death.&quot;District Commissioners Appeal Cases.Case No. 53/30. Defendant having claimed to have bought the githaka for 1,006 goats, plaintiff commented : &quot;This is the very greatest lie. These amounts can buy land from Limuru to Uplands.&quot;Case No. 1/30. It is stated in the judgment that about 3,000 acres of land were alleged to have been sold, half to one party for 900 goats and 90 rams, and half to the other party
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I-Chapter VII] Private Rights and Ownfor 80 goats and 7 rams (or as another witness stated, 7.1 goats).   The District Commissioner comments: &quot;All this, [If , ,. what.it is worth, may be some indication of prices obtain!,! at the time as well as of the lies that are told about them.&quot; jj264. These records show that, when the question of geng compensation to the tribe has not been involved in the issue, uio modest estimates have prevailed. The estimate given in bun at Kiambu to the 1929 Committee was &quot;80 or 100. sheep&quot; as tl average price of a githaka.265. When Mr. ITobley wrote a memorandum in February 1912, stating the case for the payment of further compensation-the Kikuyu, he wrote that the payments which they had made-the&apos;Dorobo &quot;often amounted to as much as 1,000 goats.&quot; He mi have&apos;depended on the Kikuytt for this information and, if the mk of Ivihara had really paid 47,000 goats and the mbari of Mho. 30,000 goats, and other mbaris also had paid the enormous aniouti of which they now tell us, it is strange that they should not he mentioned it to him and so have improved their case. We can oa conclude on the evidence before us that these representations at deliberately false. Nor in view of all the falsehoods told to us a w?e suppose that the exact truth wras always told to Air. Hoble It seems probable that his estimate that the payments oft amounted to 1,000 goats should be discounted considerably.266. We do not suggest that all these claims are deliberate; false. There may be some which are true. No doubt there ate at cases in which the claimants, being ignorant of the true hista of their land, were led away into extravagant estimates by tl general spirit of exaggeration which is very evidently abroad. \YL-Chief Koinange tells us that the githaka of the mbari of Njttntt VII bought for about 9,000 goats, he may be sincere in his estimac but he would be the first to admit that he has no accurate knm ledge. He represents that payments have been made by Lusts merits through four generations and that no record or rehab tradition of the original payment exists.Propitiatory 267.

Another point.to. which we wish to call attention before n&quot; this section is the number of times wheri girls are included ic so-called purchase price or when land is given in compensa-for a man slain. These transactions suggest that the real on and origin of the payments may have been the making of e and alliance between families and that in origin the question nd was of secondary importance. The constant reference to lion also, supports this view.-269. Twenty-three cases of girls being included in the pur-e price and four cases of persons being killed and land being $ as compensat-on have been mentioned in claims to the Com-Tion, and we understand that a perusal of Native Tribunal cases jrcvealed more instances of both kinds.1270. We feel that it would be rash for us to record any de-opinion on the amounts customarily paid to the Dorobo for We have not yet admitted that, in origin, they were pay-ts for land at all. We can only say at this point that we are lied that payments of goats were sometimes made by Kikuyu orobo either for the jmrpose of alliance or propitiation; that -iage price or blood-money was often included and may origin-have been the essence of the transaction, and that the sum in of goats was far more modest than the Kikuyu have repre-ed. The extent to which the use or management or disposal of was a condition of the transaction is the point which we shall examine.271. According to the statements made in baraza to the 1929 mittee none of the Kikuyu land north of the Chania was bought the Dorobo, whereas all the Kikuyu land south of the Chania bought from the Dorobo. Also all purchase of land between yn and Kikuyu north of the Chania was redeemable, but no bases south of the Chania were redeemable. In both areas e was a ceremony of sprinkling tatha or the stomach contents goat, Out while it did not mark the transaction as final north le Chania, it did mark it as final south of the Chania.Payment in the form of Girls or Blood-money.Conclusion regarding the Amounts paid to the Dorobo.What was the nature, intention and effect of these Payments.272.In our view it would be quite absurd to suppose that, the ent the Kikuyu crossed the Chania, they started a new system nd tenure. They brought their conceptions with them. We ose that at first, to quote the opinion of Mr. Lane, &quot;if they a Dorobo, they stuck a spear into him.&quot; Subsequently trade marriage relations began to develop. As Colonel Watkins e in 1920 :-&quot;To such people (Dorobo) the Kikuyu with their flocks ind herds must have appeared fortunately secured from famine, while they themselves, living mysteriously in gloomy
KIKUYU PROVINCE part I Chapter VI I] Private Riohth and Cforest and armed with poisoned arrows, must have seem beings to propitiate rather than to attack.&quot;273. But it is clear from the evidence that there must ha been many cases of bloodshed. The result would probably be fight and then a peace, attended by a blood compensation whij would sometimes be found by a payment of girls or goats. Nodottl the conditions of settlement would contain a reference to the latj and the extent to which the Kikuyu might cut down the fore? where the Dorobo hunted. It is native custom to keep exclmnj as equal as possible and to keep alive the sense of mutual obligatioi and it is reasonable to suppose that, as the Dorobo found hiins more and more restricted in his hunting grounds through the clea ing operations of the Kikuyu, he would ask for something to ket the balance true that is something equivalent to what the Kiktn were getting out of the land.274. A Dorobo witness, whose father had been adopted bv \]\ Kikuyu, informed us that, while it is true that payments were trot progressively as the clearing proceeded and these according tot! amount of land cleared, yet there was a stipulated sum for ft land and, though the payments were spread over generations,! end was eventually reached, and the payment was irrevocable.275. It seems improbable that the subsequent payments a be regarded as the balance of a stipulated purchase-price, because native custom dislikes hard and fast arrangements of that kit The suggestion that the first payment was for the land and 11 subsequent payments for the clearing is hard to accept, because i cannot conceive that the land would have been worth anythit without the right to clear it. But a finding that the original pa ment was in respect of alliance or goodwill and that the sequent payments were for progressive clearing would be rem, ably consistent with the evidence and with what we communication brir. ourselves to believe. .276. If that is true, there would be nothing essentially irrevoj able about the transaction, although in practice, after the had been cleared, the Dorobo would have found it hard to resunl possession. But just as an adoption ceremony can be revoke one supposes that the alliance could come to an end. The followirl quotation from evidence in District Commissioners Appeal Caf No. 1/31 (Kiambu) provides support for the view that, as originallj conceived, the transactions were not irrevocable.Karanja Waweru (a Dorobo) : Besides the 300 goats pa] to my grandfather, Waweru was paid 700 goats by Kiarie.Examined : Why would he pay some more if the pricefc] already been paid?
KIKUYU PROVINCE j_rjnAi.tek VII] Private Rights and ClaimsKaranja Waweru : A debt on land can never be finished. In the old days there was no outright sale. There is to-day.Examined : Do you claim that you have any interest in the land?Karanja Waweru : Yes, I am entitled to receive goats when I ask for them, and my descendants after me, and if I do not receive them. I am entitled to take a piece of land and make it over to somebody else for goats and I could get goats from them whenever I wanted, and my son&apos;after me.Examined : Do you claim that this is Kikuyu country or Dorobo?Karanja Waweru : Kikuyu. I admit it belongs to the Kikuyu to whom it was sold, but I claim that 1 am always entitled to receive goats on it to balance the profits which the purchaser is getting out of the land.Senior Chief Koinange : I remember that Chief Kinanjui made a brotherhood-adoption ceremony with Waweru and made him a- sort of chief of the Dorobo. Then Waweru told his people that the old sales of land which his pieople had made to the Kikuyu were not valid, and that there should be a second purchase. I do not know how many goats Kiarie paid, but he paid some. I do not know how many thousands of goats Waweru got for the Dorobo altogether, but this second purchase was final.277. If these statements are true the position of the Kikuyu ore this final payment was analogous to that of &quot;Aguri&quot; under ir own custom as it existed and still exists in Nyeri and Port1 Districts, by which land is ldaned in exchange for goats andbe redeemed by repayment.278. Gradually the situation changed as the Kikuyu first gained qual, and then a superior, position. The transitional stage mayr e been a- kind of partnership, and in some of the claims before e find the Dorobo and the Kikuyu claiming to own or to have land in common. For instance, in Kiambu District Commis-er&apos;s Appeal No. 40/30 a witness, Wachaga s/o Hinga, ed : &quot;I am a Kikuyu and Bera was a Dorobo. He was an adopted brother of mine . . . Bera and I sold land to Kanguruto and other land we sold to Njao.&quot;279. In claims Nos. 33 and 99 it is stated that the githaka bought from a Kikuyu and a Dorobo. In claims Nos. 155 and the mbari of the alleged Dorobo vendor has submitted a joint m with the mbari of the alleged buyer, and other similar in-ces could be quoted.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I-Chapter VII] Private Rights and Cur280. In most cases, however, it is certain that the Dorobo soe fell into an inferior position and either left the country or sort&quot;] adoption by the Kikuyu. In some cases it seems from the evident that they were forced into the adoption ceremony by the fear tin their lives would not be safe otherwise. Even after adoption the claim that they kept some land back for their own use..281. The time at which the Ivikuyu ceased making payment to the Dorobo iu respect of the land is uncertain, but in the southet part of the district the practice evidently continued until at; Eiiianjui was chief and we regard it as probable that the idea of finality of purchase as a definite transaction was an innovatio introduced by him and copied from Europeans. Nevertheless, it probable that in the northern part of the district the Dorobo It already become absorbed, or driven out, and payments, if the were ever made, had ceased.The.effect of 282. According to the Kikuyu Land Tenure Report, the effeTransactions. of these transactions has been that &quot;Kikuyu families are the in disputed successors in the occupation of areas over which Doro! families once hunted.&quot; We regard that as an over-statement: so far as the word &quot;undisputed&quot; is concerned. Several claims hat in fact reached us from Dorobo claiming large stretches of ti Kikuyu Native Reserves. In some cases the claim is made in t! words : &quot;Being Dorobo we inherited the land from our ancestors, These claims are not confined to the Kiambu District, but enibra also a large part of the Fort Hall Native Reserve.283. Possibly the Kikuyu theory that their land rights iu ti Kiambu District rest on purchase from the Dorobo would not wo out very favourably for them, if it were used as the only support their rights. The Dorobo can reasonably contend : (a) that t! sales, generally speaking, are not proved, and that probably mm of the land was not sold; (b) that the obligation of protection co: ferred on these Kikuyu adopters was not carried out, and that, soon as the Kikuyu had got his land, the Dorobo was sometim &quot;de-adopted&quot; as the Kikuyu themselves confessed to the 15: Committee; (c) that the alleged &quot;sales&quot;, when they took place; all, were not final, but only redeemable loans, as the action Chief Kiiianjui&apos;proves, and that the alleged final payment v,ast: generally agreed by the Dorobo and did not reach many of then (d) that in many cases they are still partners in the land; and that, when and in so far as they sold land, they frequently reserv; a piece for themselves, as the Kikuyu Land Tenure Report admit284. We shall not take the responsibility of pronouncing i these assertions, but we think that, if the Kikuyu were fully realize their implication, they would be less ready to insist tt
KIKUYU PROVINCE 2_Chapter VII] Private Rights and Claims;ry land question should be decided on historical grounds and uld be more willing to concede something to the claims of bene-ial occupation.2S5. By a process which consisted, as we have seen, partly of Towhatexte &apos;ance and partnership and partly of adoption and absorption, gfiiAofca rtly of payment, and largely of force and chicanery, the Kikuyu System d already succeeded the Dorobo when  Count Teleki passed ^f&apos;0^^ oun&apos;h kikuyu land in 1887. While it is clear from the haphazard farT^s wlre V in which the clans are distributed that the original settlement alienated, s by families acting independently, yet they were forced into re sort of cohesion along the ridges by the necessities of the se.  At any rate Count Teleki found each ridge to be virtually independent sovereignty, and as he crossed the stream which ided it from the next he was met by a crowd of natives under Muthamdki, or Headman, demanding tribute.   There seems to no doubt and, if there had been any doubt, it would have been solved by the map of the claims made to the Commission but at these Athamaki regarded themselves as the lords of the ridges \vn to the point where the streams each side of them met.  This int frequently lay well beyond the utmost limit to which the kuvtt ever have penetrated, and one of the claims embraces all e laud between the Thika and Athi Rivers right down to the mwita Siano and includes the Yatta Plateau. Quite obviously they ere claims of sovereignty rather than of land holding, and we had in evidence that as late as 1896 &quot;each hilltop was fighting with e next.&quot;  The evidence of Air. John Boyes leaves no doubt that e various sections under rival Athamaki were ready to fight each her on the slightest provocation.  The situation clearly was that ere was a series of petty and virtually independent Kikuyu groups -added from each other by streams.  Generally speaking what had ssed from the Dorobo to the Kikuyu w7as not a number of agrarian fates, but a succession of seigniories along the ridges.286. We find it very doubtful whether the idea of a private fate as distinct from the totality of the ridge had been fully con-ived at that time. Prior rights to particular portions of the ridge the family which had colonized them were probably recognized some degree, but must have been extremely nebulous, as is own by the large number of rival claims which have been lodged, obably by the time that Government embarked on its programme land settlement in 1902, something more nearly resembling the thaka system as now understood had begun to appear in the more ckly populated areas, but was still so new a conception and so certain of its place in native custom that, when the Limuru mis were alienated and some of these ithaka were lost, their istence was never even mentioned to the officer who was charged th the duty of paying compensation.   An indication that the
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter VII] Private Rights and Ciunit of land tenure at that time was still to he found in the riij rather than the githaka is provided by the fact that many of i claims made to us have been joint claims-bj&apos; several mbari to t land between the rivers without any reference to the boundat of their individual iihaka.287. The circumstances in which the alienation of land; European settlement took place have been well-described in \ Mortimer&apos;s memorandum, which has been printed with the et ence. it suffices to say here that most of the alienations affectt the Kikuyu took place between 1902 and 1907, although there wt a few which were of a later date. There is evidence in the files show that there appeared to the responsible officers of that ti to be plenty of land remaining for all reasonable requirements the Kikuyu. In view of the very large amount of land still remained ing to the Kikuyu at the time the opinion is understandable. It easy to be wise after the event, and to say that the conditio which we describe in the economic sections of this Report ought have been foreseen, namely, that there wrould be a large natn increase in the population and a tendency to gravitate towat Nairobi and the railway so that problems of local congestion wot inevitably appear.288. We have to consider whether these difficulties call for a: special recommendations on our part for the compensation of t dividuals or special sections of the tribe, or whether a solutioni tribal lines will suffice.289. While certain areas have been added to the reserve, has already been described, the particular right-holders who we dispossessed did not receive any individual allocation of land, at were compensated only in respect of their cultivated gardens. 11 compensation was at the rate of two rupees an acre.290. In cases where the)7 did not take this compensation the had the right to remain on the land under the protection of sectii 31 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1902, and subsequently und section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 191-5. We find it: be a fact that the existence of this legal protection was not general known to the natives, and that many of those who left the k might have elected to remain if they had known of these protectit -clauses.
349CHAPTER VIII.The density at-which the Landalienated was Inhabited.AN EXAMINATION OF PRIVATE EIGHTS AN])CLAIMS-(PART 2). Number of Persons Claiming Rights on Land which has been Alienated.291. We have now completed our survey of the historical of the Kikuyu private claims, and in the next chapter we have to make proposals for the just settlement of the private s which exist on land which has been alienated. Before doing is well that we should make clear, as far as we can, what her of persons are affected.292. It will be sufficiently accurate for our purpose if we ider every &quot;household&quot; (i.e., the average members of a marrieds family, not the inhabitants of a single hut) to consist of five ons and the proportion of wives per married man to be 1.5, the cultivation per wife to be tine acre with half-an-acre per sehold thrown in for fallow and for the labour of unmarriedand other dependants. We shall therefore reckon two acres iiltivatioii per household.293. The allowance for fallow seems small, but we are con-ng only land which had been so recently cultivated that itit have been counted as part of the family gardens when com-tion was paid.294. We shall consider the Kiambu District first and take the ited blocks one at a time in the order given in the schedule ection 223 (a) above, to which reference should here be made, ictual evidence on which we can base an opinion of the density pulation in the several blocks is veryr meagre, and in many es we have to make a guess on the general probabilities of the Among the factors which have weight in determining our ate we draw attention to the conclusion, which we have dy reached and recorded in Chapter II, that the general aver-ilensity obtaining in the Kiambu Native Reserve in 1902 was to the square mile, and we also remark that these alienated with the exception of the eastern end of the Limuru farms, situated on the borders of the Kikuyu territory near the forest e. and are therefore likely to have been inhabited at a density iderably below the average for the reserve.295. In the Kikuyu Station Block 7.48 square miles of Kikuyu The Kikuyutory have been alienated, as shown in items 1 and 2 of the ule. Mr. McClure&apos;s map, mentioned in section 136 above, s the area as inhabited in considerable density.   Some of theStation Block.
Part I-Chapter VIII]KIKUYU PROVINCEPrivate Rights ami rjjThe Block from Kabete to Kiambu and including Fort Smith.villages which he shows may have been recently moved hi re elsewhere, and had possibly not been built in 1902. But Lhell in the immediate neighbourhood of Kikuyu Station was n it i ated until 1904, by which date the density must have been a as represented in the map.  This would appear to suggest a da of between 80 and 90 to the square mile, but the area alienate the Church of Scotland Mission is known to have been more th: populated, and probably brings up the average density per w mile over all to about 100.  That would give 748 persons, whoa regard as forming 150 families of five, having an area of Iani cultivation equal to about 300 acres.296. Dagoretti Register &quot;B&quot; shows that Es. 404 were pended in this area on compensation at Es. 2 an acre, which probably paid for rather fewer than 202 acres, since we be that many small fragments were allowed to count as acres, uncompensated residue would therefore be more than the app balance of 98 acres, and may have been more like 200 acre-:. &apos; of the uncomjiensated residue would have been found on the of the Church of Scotland Mission, concerning which Dr. Et Scott wrote : &quot;Most of the native shambas are left intact, therefore, of course, uncompensated.&quot; The &quot;reconstructed p! the mission in 1902, produced in evidence, shows 19 native vii containing 130 huts, which would be equal to about 87 &quot;h holds&quot;, which might be expected to have about 174 acr-effective cultivation.297. On the other estates it would appear probable that pensation was paid and that most of the natives left, and. alt the figures do not work out in every respect, we find it pr that our estimate, when put into round numbers, is approxii right, namely, that this block was inhabited at a density of: 100 to the square mile; that the population consisted of aboi families, of whom about half were compensated and the other principally occupying the land of the Church of Scotland Mi remained where they were, uncompensated.29S. In the block from Kabete to Kiambu (and including! Smith) 23 square miles of Kikuyu territory have been alien The &quot;evidence indicates that the land round Fort Smith a immediate neighbourhood of Kabete was at least as thickly lated as the general average of the reserve. But easlwarj Kabete until the effective border was reached the pops.1 dwindled, as was natural on the fringe of the territory. 01 northern extension towards Kiambu we have found that the alienated as farms 80, 81, 82 and 25 was covered with forJ which there may have been a few clearings, but to the n
KIKUYU PROVINCE r i_Chapter VIII] Private Rights and Claimsni the population became thicker as the present reserve bound-was approached. The available evidence does not warrant a lident estimate but, the general average density in the reserve )&quot;&apos; 150. we consider it unlikely in the face of the evidence given yir. Lane. Colonel Ainsworth, Dr. Doedeker, Mr. McClellan [son, Mr. Knapp, Mr. Douglas Cooper and others, that the rage density.in this block exceeded 110 to the square mile even r allowance has been made for considerable density around Fort itii. This would give a total of 2,530 persons whom one may aid as consisting of 506 families of five, who might be presumed i,ive 1,012 acres in cultivation.2!!&apos;). We must now consider how this agrees with the amounts orded to have been paid in compensation in this area.   Theister shows Ks. 1,525 and one ox, and there is a further record a payment of Rs. 20, so that, if the value of the ox is assessed Es. -10. the total becomes Ks. 1,685. This would nominally resent compensation for 812 acres, but was probably paid out a lesser amount than that lor the reason which has already n described. Kor must the point be neglected that part of this ipensation, for instance, the Ks. 75 paid in the Thimbigwa :t, was paid to stray Kikuyu who had made clearings for them--es outside the effective limits of Kikuyu territory and were not ng in this block of twenty-three square miles.300. After weighing these factors we remain of opinion that average density in this block was about 110 to the square mile, that the population consisted of abort 506 families of five. The ires obtained from the Register suggest that about three-quarters these were compensated and left, while the other quarter was compensated and remained.301. The Kamiti River block is an area of 7.72 square miles, The Kamiti mr more than half of which we have found to have been forest or River Block h with possibly a few clei it.  The remainder may haven inhabited up to the average density obtaining in the reserve.consider 100 to the square mile to be a reasonable approximation, s would give 772 persons whom we may regard as 154 families five. The land actually cultivated by them would presumably about 308 acres.302. The Register shows Rs. 555 paid out in compensation, ch would represent nominally 277 cultivated acres compensated, t it is probable, for the reason already given, that the Rs. 555 e paid out in respect of a rather less area of cultivation than the linal figure. The uncoinpensated residue might, therefore, be rer to 60 acres than 31, which is the ostensible balance. This Id indicate that round about three-quarters of the natives took
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I-Chapter VIII] Private Rights and (This Farms between the Ngewa and Chania RiversThe Block North of the Chania.The Limuru Farms (main Block).compensation and moved, while about one-quarter had no coi pensation and remained. This is in general conformity with t! evidence, especially the native evidence, which insists throu&quot;ho that most of the natives were &quot;told to quit.&quot; The point of diffj ence is that the natives generally say that no compensation w paid.303. After weighing the points we consider that this block w inhabited at a density of about 100 to the square mile; that ;!, were about 154 families living in it, and that about three-quarti of them received compensation and moved, while the rest remain on the hind.304. This is an area of 17*10 square miles. We have ton practically the whole of it to have been uninhabited in 1.90*2, a to have been so little used even for the grazing of cattle that have hesitated whether it ought to be shown as Ivikuyu territ tit till. We consider that very little, if tiny, of it was used fori grazing of cattle in 1902, but that there probably was some de; of effective use before the famine. There is no evidence that the time of the alienations in 1905 there were any dwelling.- at in the northern part, but in the southern part a certain amount compensation was paid and we may set down 50 households representing the total population of the entire block at that time 305. The total compensation shown in the Register to h been paid in this area is Its. 168, representing compensation 84 acres, which would be the rough equivalent of the garden: 42 households.306. According to the evidence this block appears to have practically-uninhabited.   No record has been found of any c pensation paid, and it is doubtful whether at any time there v any natives living in it.  In so far as it was used at all, it was grazing.307. The part of the Limuru farm area which is hatched oti a yellow background on the coloured map following section and appears as item 7 in section 223 (a) is 45.90 square miles, we may refer to it as the main block in cohtra-distinction to area tit its western extremity which is cross-hatched. We deal in the sections below with the main block.308. While all the other alienations were to some extei: the edge of the country, the eastern end of the Limuru farms ( a definite projection into the Kikuyu country. There is nothir its position in connexion with the rest of the reserve, therefor indicate that it was inhabited below the average density, apart from evidence given to us, w*e should probably asstti somewhat sparse population because the altitude rendered the
KIKUYU PROVINCE x I-Chapter VIII] Private Rights and Claimsjurable for the crops which the Kikuyu principally cultivated that time.   Count Teleki, who crossed this area before the ne, describes a stage in his journey when he apparently went what is now Air. Knight&apos;s farm to what is now Njunu Estate, states that tho population was Jess thick than it had been &apos;8 previous stages of his journey in kikuyu land, but that ages of as many as 20 huts were still encountered.309. In the famine the population seems to have disappeared a large extent and to have been slow in returning.   Secondary h grew up, and several of the European witnesses have described area as practically devoid of population.   Dr. Boedeker, how-r, considered that it was as thickly populated as the rest of the310. Mr. Morson describes a journey from Nairobi to Limuru 1904 in which he took a route near where the present &quot;A&quot; route I. This would have taken him the whole length of what is nowLimuru farms, and also through about five miles of what is 1 native reserve, but he states that he saw no natives. We take 5 to be evidence on the one hand that native occupation was jrse and evidence on the other hand of how very easy it is to ;s seeing the natives as one passes through a country, until a siderable degree of density has been reached. Air. Impey states ,t in 1904 there were, in his opinion, no more than ten natives the square mile in the part of the Limuru farms which lies bin eight miles of Limurn, that is to say nearly the whole of in.311. On the other hand it is generally considered that, when farms in this block were alienated, about half the natives con-ted on the land and about half were moved. Of those who red all who applied were paid compensation to the extent of 2 per acre. The Register shows a total payment of Rs. 1.036 he Limuru farm area, representing compensation for 518 culti-;d acres. Those who remained probably had an equal amount of 3 in cultivation, so that there would have been 1,036 cultivated ;s. This would mean that one acre in every 28 was cultivated.312. Since it has been credibly stated that at that time one -tied woman usually cultivated one acre and that married women e about 3*1 per cent of the po2udation, the total population dd be 3,342, or 73 to the square mile. This conclusion is ed on several unproved assumptions, but seems to us to be formable with the probabilities. It takes no account of natives ) may have left without compensation when the farms were rated, but it is not likely that they were many.  If we increaseestimate to 80 to the square mile we probably cover them, and

At 80 to the square mile the population would be 3, persons, whom we may regard as forming 734 families of five.314. Reference to the map will show certain areas at western end of the Limuru farms, close to the Railway and extenl ing southward to Muguga. This land amounts to 4.50 square mi:! in all, of which we have decided that three-quarters were bi forest-covered. In Mr. McClure&apos;s map) five villages are shown Mr. Kay Mouafs land (L.O. No. 170 and 177) but, all told unlikely that the total population in this area exceeded thirl households of five, so that we may put the density as between:] and 35 persons to the square mile. There is no record of compensi tion paid, and it may perhaps be assumed that the population, si as it was. remained on the land.315. L.O. 4961, 669 acres, is an island of Crown land in i native reserve and is situated near the north-western extremity the estate of Saba-Saba, Limited.  It was alienated in freehold j 1904, but has since reverted to the Crown.   At the time of i alienation it appears to have been unoccupied.316. Before  the alienations, -satisfactory arrangements ! already been made with the local chiefs for the disposal of natives in the locations which are now in the charge of Clj Nduini and Headman Nderi, in the Nyeri District and at the! of the alienation there were no residents.317. The total area alienated in freehold to mission outstati forming isolated islands in the reserve is about 0&quot;16 of a squil mile. In most cases vacant lands were assigned, and there tra few, if any, huts on any of this land. No account has been tat! of mission land in the reserve which has been alienated on because such land has not been excluded from the reserve and t rents are paid to the Local Native Council.318. The total area alienated from the land which we found to have been properly Kikuyu territory in the Kiaaj District is 109J square miles in all, exclusive of the area of a] mately 16J square miles which we have found to have been airea abandoned by the Kikuyu before it was alienated (vide secfj -223 (a) above). The total number of families of five which have found to be resident on them is 1,594. This gives a dens! of 73 persons to the square mile as opposed to about 150 in] reserve. Having regard to the fact that the land alienated v\ (a) generally speaking on the fringe of the territory: (tV pai under forest or scrub in the Kiambu and Kamiti areas, ami 1
KIKUYU PROVINCE I t Chapter VIII] Private Rights and ClaimsI? for grazing in the northern areas, and above the altitude most fable for native crops in the Limuru area, we consider this rence to be in accordance with the facts.319. Speaking generally, we find it probable that, when Gov-ent alienated this land, the proportion of cultivated land in nclusive of fallow, was of the order of one acre in every twenty -to thirty acres. This consorts both with the foregoing calcula-s and also with the impressions which we have formed after ing the evidence, both native and non-native.320. The total compensation shown above as having been paid s. 3,848.  It does not agree exactly with the table at page 364e evidence which shows Es. 3,872 and sundry sheep and cattle.discrepancy is not very significant and we are justified in con-ing that about 962 households were compensated (at Es. 2 anand two acres per household). Since we have found the total iber of households to have been about 1,594, there must have i about 632 households or families of five who received no com-sation and continued to live on the land.321. After 1908 no further entries appear in the Dagoretti ister, which is our main source of information concerning com-sation paid. But it is certain that between that date and the sent time many families drifted away, most of them uncom-sated. On the other hand the residue that remained has in-sed in numbers by natural increase and the position to-dayr ears to be that there are possibly three or four hundred house-s living as of right on farms in the alienated blocks.
CHAPTER IX.The Question of Conipensa-tion.GUTiaha Rights outside &quot;Kikuyu Territory.&quot;IndividualClearingsoutside&quot;KikuyuTerritory.&quot;AN EXAMINATION OF PRIVATE RIGHTS AND CLAIMS (PART 3). The Question of Compensation for Loss of Private hi and for Disturbance.322. That concludes our summary of the facts, and we ha now to consider whether the compensation paid by Government individuals was adequate or, if it was not adequate, what practk steps can be taken. In approaching the matter we wish firs dispose of the question whether any claim of any sort can now entertained in respect of land which is not included in what have found to be either &quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory in 1895&quot; &quot;admissibly acquired by the Kikuyu by 1902.&quot; To avoid prolisi we shall for the remainder of this chapter allude to the area und these two heads simply as &quot;Kikuyu territory.&quot;323. We shall consider this question both under its aspect gitliaka rights and also in respect of individual clearings.324. We are satisfied that no ithaka in the sense of estat can be said to have existed outside &quot;Kikuyu territory&quot;, as we defined it. Any pretence that the land was bought from Doro will not stand examination, since we are satisfied that such pa ments as were made to Dorobo w7ere by instalments paid accordc to the extent of the progressive clearing of the land. If the la: was not cleared, it is an indication that it had not been bougi Nor were the Dorobo so effectively or exclusively established i the land as to have been able to claim a right to sell it. Therew no effective occupation by the Kikuytt and if any Kikuyu headm or &quot;elders&quot; or aramati have claimed that they exercised authority there, we are satisfied that such pretensions are fake.325. There were a few7 venturesome Kikuyu who, relyingi the Pax Britannica, began about the year 1900 and onwards make clearings in the forest beyond their fellows in areas i which they would not previously have ventured. We cannot all that such persons established any right to land but we consid that they were entitled to compensation for disturbance only, are satisfied that, as far as can now be ascertained, such compee; tion w7as always paid whenever application was made for it tot responsible officer. We have no reason to suppose that natii were not fully aware how to apply for compensation, but it wo: be impossible to say at this date what percentage of them faili to do so.
KIKUYU PROVINCEhit I Chapter IX]Private Rights and Claims35332G. We consider that the rate of compensation was adequate the case of those natives who were living outside Kikuyu terri-rv. They were able to return to their own right-holding in Jkuyu territory and to extend it if necessary. In the district fincipally affected by the alienations, namely, Kiambu District, [ere was at that time no such congestion as would have prevented loir doing so, and the actual cost of moving their huts after reap-their crops would, in conditions obtaining at that time, haveSen sufficiently met by the compensation provided, since under e tribal custom then in force a man was always able to obtain the assistance of his neighbours in building his hut, and the material 1st nothing.327. While no substantial harm was done to any individual Stive, we recognize that the setting of hard and fast boundaries the reserve precluded natives from extending their frontiers by le time-honoured method of clearing and burning forest, and we Icept it as an obligation under the first term of reference to con-tier the needs of future expansion, though not necessarily on thai lines.28. We now turn to the consideration of compensation for Loss of Land pss of land which was inside Kikuyu territory.  We have already &quot;Kiknyu Bade the comprehensive recommendation that, if possible, hind  i*?mlorv-Soulcl be added to the reserve equivalent to the balance of loss, fhat we have here to consider is whether any special recominenda-ons have to be made to recompense particular individuals or actions.   We shall consider them in three groups :   (i) right-Slklers; (ii) gitJiaka holders; (iii) tenants.529. The substance of the complaint is that in respect of dis- Loss sustained j:bance the compensation given to right-holders was inadequate, holders&apos;&apos;4&quot; jcl that in respect of land no compensation was given at all.  We all consider the question of land first.330. It is mot altogether true that no compensation was paid the loss of land. Ndeiya grazing area was added to the reserve Id there are also some other areas which we have found to be litknate off-sets against the loss.   But the actual right-holders po suffered loss were not given the land.331. In considering what was due to the right-holders notice ast be taken of the fact that the rights which they exercised on lands of which they were deprived by.no means amounted to Il ownership.
K1KTJVU PROVINCE Part I Chapter iX] Private Rights and ru332. The following is the account given in the Kikuyu La Tenure Keport oi&apos; the limitations of the rights of a right-holder, as he is there called, a sub-owner : &quot;We find that he is restricted in two ways from full owner hi (a) First by the privileges which other members of the el or mbari enjoy on the land, and which are secured byi customary sanctions of tribalism, which tend to prove an individual share from being precisely defined, addition to the individual share to which his right virtually exclusive, he has a part interest in the rose area of uncultivated land which remains undistributed the hands of the Muramati, and in this area his right limited by the fact that other members of the mbari.A have rights, and even non-resident members may claim to be accommodated if there is room for them, f.&apos; restriction is definitely less in Kiambu than elsewhe and is disappearing. (6) Secondly, he is limited to the extent to which the right use which he enjoys differs from exclusive use. Gradual the conception of the uses to which land can be put enlarged, and with the relaxation of clan-control it found that the right of exclusive use can be extended cover most of them . . . (in Kiambu) though grazt still remains a common right the &quot;owner&quot; is allowed exercise a right of discrimination which is half-way an exclusive right.&quot;333. It is clear therefore that, when the land was taken am it was not only the right-holder who suffered, but that all tl members of the mbari shared in the loss, since up to that ti; the spare land on the githaka- had been available for them a, their descendants to cultivate and to live in so long as there w room. It is also clear that the right-holder, when he lost this lac had a selection of other holdings open to him, on which he cop &quot;claim to he accommodated&quot;, and that the right-holders of whit ever githaka he finally&quot; selected for his home must have suffered corresponding diminution of the balance of land at their dispos A third and most important consideration is that the right tos pasture cattle on uncultivated land was common to all the kit and since at least nine-tenths of the land was uncultivated it clear that the rights of the tribe were very extensive.334. It appears, therefore, that in considering the question allotting the land to be added in compensation, we must take in account not only the dispossessed right-holders but all the aw bers of the mbari and, in some degree, the whole of the tribe. Tl is a point which must have been present in the minds of li
KIKITYU PROVINCE j_Chai&apos;Ij:u IX] Private Rights and Claimsajifcs when they submitted their memoranda, since in stating total number of members of their mbari represented in the n they have given far more than could ever have been resident the land, land must be presumed to have included those non-dent members who had an interest in it.335, When we add up the total strength of all the mbari ing to be concerned we arrive at a total which is greater by r cent than the total residents of the Kiambu Native Reserve, alter every allowance lias been made for the tremendous considerations of which the Kikuyu are capable, we take this to be ndication that most of the members of the tribe consider them-es to have an interest in the land which has been lost, and not the resident right-holders.336. It might perhaps be thought that a solution could be id by dividing the compensatory land between the dispossessed t-holders according to the size of their former holdings, andinsisting that they should accord to the kindred of their mbarisame rights as they would have had in the original land, ctical considerations put this out of the question.   Even if itbeen done at the time of the original alienations, it would bably have been an unpopular arrangement, and, while the ck addition to the reserve would have been welcomed, the dis-sessed right-holders would in many cases have preferred to ke their own arrangements rather than be ordered to live in it. s noteworthy that, although Ndeiya, an area of 74 square miles,added to the reserve in 1913 and was commonly regarded as ipensation or part compensation for their losses, the Kikuyu e kept it as a grazing area and have generally opposed any freshen that any&quot; private or prior rights should be created. They e always regarded it as an asset of the whole tribe, and thet-holders from the alienated lands have never claimed any consideration.337. We are convinced that the responsible elders of the ay ii have always regarded the loss of the Limuru farms and er territory as a matter of tribal rather than individual concern, respect of compensation for the land lost we agree with this v to the extent that we find it to offer the best and most ticable solution, and we have recommended compensation to tribe to the full extent of the land lost. We have considered ther in justice to the right-holders we ought to recommend that r rights should be accorded to them in the land to be added, t if we are over-solicitous for the various sectional interests and to reproduce on the new land all the rights that existed on the . so that the tribe, the group, the right-holder and the tenants nld all of thetm be precisely compensated, we are convinced that

The best interests of-people will be served if the compensatory area is given as a sin;; addition to the reserve and placed under the general protection. Government and the Land Board without any special condi or obligations.338. &quot;We do not for a moment mean that it should he kept a commonage or that no private rights should be created, point is that with the addition of this block of land to the rose and the payment of such further compensation as we shall presem recommend the troubles of the past should be considered to been decently buried.339. In the chapter on &quot;Exchanges, Adjustments nnd Sjec Cases&quot; we review a number of special cases.   One of them a statutes an exception to what has just been written, because appears to us that a definite pledge was given which inn-honoured.   It is the case which arose from the alienation of; land now occupied by the Government Farm and the Governme Farm Extension.   In this case we feel bound to make a reco; mendation that an area in the compensatory block or alterna land elsewhere should be reserved to the use of the disposse mbari under terms and conditions which we shall specify. I are also a few other cases in which we shall have to affirm prior rights exist or should be allowed.340. We now yass to the question of compensation for turbance. We are still speaking of right-holders, and it wil convenient to consider them in three categories : those who compensation and left the farms before 1908, the date of the I entry in the Register; those who remained on the land until; 1908, but left eventually; and those original right-holders or th direct descendants who are still on the land.341. We have found through a computation made in the; vious chajiter that the total number of householders who (c compensation and left the land before 1908 were about 982. have no means of knowing what proportion of them were ii. holders, but judging by general probabilities, we estimate then between 750 and  CO householders. We have credited each hoc-hold (both of right-holders and tenants) with two acres of culti tion for which compensation was .paid at Es. 2 an acre, and: agrees with the Es. 3,848 which we know by the records to It been paid.342. The position, therefore, was that each householder it left received Es. 4, and he was also allowed to reap his crop. 1
KIKUYU PROVINCE I_Chapter IX] Private Rights and ClaimsBmption made by Government was that other land was avail-H to which he could go, and that the Es. 4 would be enough to-Biburse him for the actual expense of moving that is to say, Hmoving of his goods, the building of new huts, and the clearing Hie land for the new garden.H 343. We consider that in cases where the right-holder Bally had other land to which he could go, the Es. 4 probably Hie adequate to meet these charges, when regard is had to condi-his prevailing at the time.H:-&apos;-l4. In those days there was no need to pay for poles or Hcliing grass and the building of a hut was an enterprise for Heh a man was entitled to claim the assistance of his kindred.. B little expense to which he was put by way of entertainment H probably met adequately from the four rupees.Bl345. We need not consider here the loss of land, because we-Efe already covered that point and advised full compensation, Be for value, to the tribe as the best and only practicable means Hjealing with the matter. But we must consider one point in Hiexion with it, and that is the probability that in many cases Has not so easy as Government supposed for the right-holder to Be from one place where he had been living as of right, to Hither place where he could live as of right, and that incidental mm and inconvenience may have been caused to him beyond the-Ho cost of re-erecting his huts and clearing his land. While we Hnot prepared to admit without examination that this loss and Mpnvenience were as severe as has sometimes been stated, we can B believe that it was by no means negligible and the position Ht be examined.II 346. It has often been stated that, when the farms were alien-B, many of the right-holders had no other land to which they Bel go as of right and were, in fact, forced to go out and squat BEiuopean farms. We do not deny that there may be some Be in the contention, but we think that it is much exaggerated.M 347. In the first place we remark that, before the British He, tribes were exposed to frequent shocks from the invasion of Bp tribes, and must often have been forced to rectify their Kjtiers. We cannot conceive that the tribe had no way of re-Hfcbuting its population when such (adjustments had to be made.B 348. Secondly, it seems to us clear from the passage which Shave quoted from the Land Tenure Beport that the dispossessed Hit-holders had a right to be accommodated by their kindred. Dr. Hkey thinks that because they had bought the land from the Hobo with borrowed goats, there would be no obligation to admit
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter IX] Private Rights ami (Jlthem without ia return of the goats. This seems to us to be \ unlikely; surely there must have been some of then kindred fi whom they had not borrowed goats.349. Thirdly, it has been clearly shown from files which c tain the reports of surveyors and administrative officers that il was still a great deal of undeveloped land in the Kikuyu conn Although there were large parts which could be described as garden&quot;, there were other large stretches of bush and forest.350. Some at least of the dispossessed right-holders mast :. had relations living in these areas, and would have found difficulty in getting accommodation.351. Fourthly, we do not think that, twenty-five years; a tenant suffered much disability in comparison with a right-ho&apos; We are informed that natives of the Nyeri District have left t; right-holdings in large numbers and come to settle in iviai District as tenants. There is no custom of rent, and eases tenants being ordered to quit are said to have been extremely r We think it unlikely, therefore, that the prospect of bein muhoi in the reserve could have been so distasteful to a possessed right-holder as to have forced him to go and sqiiir &quot;the settled area.352. Lastly, we observe that the practice of leaving the res to go and squat did not become very widespread until the i which was more than a decade after most of the farms were al ated. And when the movement did occur, the emigrants i mostly from Fort Hall. There is no evidence before the Conn sion to show that dispossessed right-holders played any n prominent part in this emigration than any other section of community. Tt may very well have been so, but it has not i proved.353. On a comprehensive survey of the position we see I: reason to suppose that the present squatters on European 1; left the reserve because of difficulties connected with the temir land. The desire to find better pasture for cattle is generally.; sidered to have been the motive power behind the movement; grazing in the reserve being common., that is a consideration rcl affected all classes alike. Generally speaking any squatters in settled area must be held to have gone there of their own free with a view to better themselves and not as a result of any ec xnic pressure, except such as is connected with shortage of past354. In so far as this general opinion may have to be qnal in respect of particular cases in which right-holders, failing to -any suitable place in the reserve, were compelled to emigrat pressure of circumstances, there is reason to suppose that
-CllAlTKlt ix]KIKUYU PROVINCEPrivate Rights and ClaimsIt has generally been to their advantage. The average squatter Iffliihtedly is richer in stock than the average native in the ve. and consequently has been able to marry more wives and more children. It is true that, if he returns to the reserve, ill probably be put to some expense in establishing himself but, when that expense has been defrayed, it is likely that ill still be better off, on balance, than his relations who have iiaed in the reserve.jf)5. But, when all has been said, we believe that, if more een known of the Kikuyu land system than was known at ime. Government would have made some provision for the lishment of the dispossessed right-holders on land in their vc where they could live as of right, or would at least have lated the cost of disturbance on a more generous basis, so as ovule for all attendant inconvenience and loss of amenities as as the bare cost of moving and preparing their new land. We it fortunate that very little real hardship hits resulted. The iranent of the clay acted on the information available to it, and crtainly find no occasion for recommending at this date that redress is due to any individual. Nevertheless, it may be well row into the balance of the general settlement a certain ad-nal acreage to be counted, as it were, as a comprehensive -ensation for loss of amenities and -general disturbance caused he time of the alienations. While it is undeniable that the ivu have gained far more than they have lost&apos; by the establish-of white settlement with a large town and a ready market heir borders, we still find il reasonable to recommend that such me he adopted so that every aspect of past grievances may be to have been covered and finally settled.356. While this course is recommended and will be appre-tl. it dees not solve the real problem, which is economic, and neerned with the difficulty of the population distributing itself he land. The return of squatters to the reserve will create iems very similar in their nature to the land alienations of a ration ago but more severe because of the increased rigidity ie gUhalai system. The most practical remedy which we can irmend for the benefit of the Kikuyu is to suggest modifications -It will provide greater security for tenants and better -prospects eir becoming right-holders. In addition to this we shall have csals to make in the economic sections of our report to meet requirements of future expansion.357. In Chapter VIII it was computed that about 632 house- Right-holders ers remained on the land when the farms were alienated. on the^lirms1 sibly about five hundred of them were right-holders.   It need in 1908, hut ly he said that the whole calculation is extremely problema- left after-,but no means has revealed itself of obtaining a better figure. &quot;ar F&apos;
Part J Chapter IX]KiKTJYTJ PROVINCEPrivate Rights anlRight-holders who are still on the Land.Many of these families eventually left, but we cannot say many.   It is not important to establish the exact figure, and may assume, with sufficient accuracy, that three or four hum families have left the farms in this way.358. So far as can be ascertained no compensation was to these families.   On the other hand the disturbance was severe, since for the most pjart they moved at their own time occasion to suit themselves.   There have, however, been si exceptional cases in the last few years.   We know of no deft cases during these years in which right-holders have been evie in open contravention of their rights under section 86 of the Civ Lands Ordinance.   But there have probably been cases in \vl right-holders, after having signed a squatter&apos;s contract, have i evicted on the expiry of the contract under the impression that signing of the contract had put an end to any rights which i may formerly have had.   But only one ca.s.e has been reveaL such a nature as to require any special recommendation on part, and we shall deal with it in the next chapter in which discuss Exchanges, Adjustments and Special Cases.   (Vide seetij 408 to 413 below.)359. Our general recommendation is that in calculating area to be added in general compensation for disturbance and! of aimenities as recommended above, the certainty be bornel mind that some of these families were moved or were induced! sign squatter&apos;s contracts in circumstances which should, in equij have entitled them to receive compensation for loss of rights, are satisfied that it would be useless at this stage to try to irl individual cases, and all that can be done is to take them generj into account in settling with the tribe at large. We except this recommendation only such cases as may have occurred sij &quot;the Commission was appointed, and we shall deal with their] another section below.360. We now turn to the case of right-holders who are: on the land. In the case of all land alienated on lease, areas wtj were in the actual occupation of natives at the time of the tion are deemed to be excluded. In the case of all lands leased nrl the provisions of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915, the n section is section 86, to which our attention is especially dirotl in the terms of reference.   In the case of all leases under! Crown   Lands   Ordinance,   1902,   the corresponding  section! section 31.  Both sections are quoted in Appendix No. 2 for r reference, and we irterrret our instructions in the sense tha are expected to deal with both of theim.361. There are also cases of natives who wei-e in oemrntml certain lands which have since been alienated as freehold and I
X Chapter IX]KIKUYU PROVINCEPrivate Rights and Claimsresident upon them.   These cases must be held to have red by accident, since it is provided under section 30 of the h Lands Ordinance, 1902, that no land which is subject to e rights may be alienated as freehold.   In so far as such exist and in so far as the natives are still in occupation, we der that their position and rights are no less entitled in equity regarded than the rights of natives on leasehold land which rotected under the clauses cited.  We propose to deal with all together.62. Having considered the matter very fully in the light of e evidence and having regard to the opinion expressed by the ney General, which is filed with the original evidence, we learly of opinion that the position caused by the existence of clauses is most unsatisfactory. The meaning of the phrase al occupation&apos;! has been variously interpreted, and the nt; Attorney General gives them a wider connotation than his ces-sors had assigned. The prevailing uncertainty is embarras-to all concerned. If actual occupation includes githaka tenure, ccomc involved at once in all .sorts of issues of fact. The can feel no confidence as to what land is his and what is ed to be excluded from the lease as the property of some yu right-holder, who in his turn would not be safe against a ter-claim by the Dorobo on the score of pre-existing rights, that again might be contested on the ground&apos; that the Dorobovassals of the Masai.363. Another set of doubts arises in connexion with succes-Do the rights of the &quot;actual occupier&quot; cease with his death they pass to his heirs? Is the lessee bound to accommodate e lard all the progeny of the occupier and do they all succeed rights?64. We do not consider that the fairest solution of the matter he reached by the arbitrament of a Court judgment on the se significance of the phrases employed by draughtsmen in irg rp the ordinance, or the nature and effect of the so-called bo land sales or the intricacies of githaka tenure. We accept our duty to propose an equitable settlement, trusting that the .sary amendments in existing legislation will be made, even should beccn-e necessary for the general security to ask for a nl Order in Council.65. As a Land Commission we are bound to have great ct for the principle of security-, without which no agrarian ation can possibly prosper, and we deem it extremely detri-al to security and to progress that a state of things should in which lease-holders have developed their lands in reliance
Part I Chapter IX]KIKUYU PROVINCEPrivate Rights am, (j,,.on a document of lease which they hold from Government to find that it contains a clause of such doubtful significance their position is jeopardized.366. While we do not think that in equity any extreme i pretation ought to be put upon the clause, the possibility i! might be so has an extremely disquieting effect, which is terious to the good relations generally obtaining between lessees and the resident natives. Native political agitator: quick to take advantage of the situation and the resuhan discipline is embarrassing to the tribal authorities in the re as well as to the Europeans.  We consider it essential to thetnd well-being of the tribe that the areas over whits iand-the rights of its members extend should be consolidated s the addition to the reserve of the grant of land which shall recommend should be accompanied by the extinction of native private rights outside the reserve except (a) such rid if any, as may be held upon title, and (b^ such rights as mavli been acquired in another reserve, e.g\, as a muhoi under i system of land tenure obtaining.367. Generous compensation   for disturbance must nccoi pany this extinguishing of rights. We consider that it should tj the form of a payment in cash, and we believe  -2.000 to i assessment of the total -sum that should be paid.368. We do not state the compensation at any particulars! 1 er household, because the evidence and memoranda submitted! us in the mbari claims provide a warning of the extravagant tensions which would he put forward.  But we think that, if local native council has a definite sum given to it from which col pensation&apos; should be paid, but which should not be exceeded, i probable that a jr.st distribution can be effected.  We consider t Government should decide the proportion due to each Xa:i Council on the basis of the data which are contained in this rerl and that the Councils should then draw- up a list of the pera to be compensated and the amounts payable to each, but slto not actually make the payment until the sanction of the Provini Commissioner has been received.   Tn making this recommends; we have had regard to the number of families now living on farms as of right, as far as we are able to estimate it from information before us.369. While our general recommendation is that cash o pensation should be paid to Kikuyu who are now living on farms as of right, but not to those who have left, we consider; a point should be stretched in favour of those who have farms since the Comimission was appointed.
kenya land commission bepobtKIKUYU PROVINCE r_Chapter IX] Private Rights and Claims370. We have already explained that in our opinion the linistrative authorities, after consulting the native authorities, uld be free to develop the land added to the reserve in what-r way may seem best in the interest of the tribe, and we are illino&apos; to embarrass them with any special recommendation t these persons should receive special consideration in regard to t land. But we do not doubt but that the Administration would all in its power to ensure that they should find proper accom-flation in the reserve, either in the added blocks or elsewhere.371. In order to ensure that the settlement should be final we ,mmend that, as soon as the compensation has been paid andding crops have been reaped and reasonable notice to quit has ii given, all private rights of Kikuyu natives outside the Kikuyu reserve, except those to which we have alluded above, should be ringed. We doubt whether this can be -satisfactorily ac-iplished without an Order in Council, and we therefore recoin-id that an Order in Council be sought.372. In Part HI of this report we shall consider this problem ts gereral application to the country at large, and examine the ent to which the same treatment can be applied elsewhere.it must be understood that there are special cases, both in ayu and elsewhere, which must be reviewed separately on their its and those which concern Kikuyu are reviewed in the pter which follows. The question of increasing the rent against lessee in consideration of the enhancement in the value of thewhich will result from the removal of these disabilities may eft to Government. Clause 31 (5) of the Crown Lands Ordin-, 1902, is relevant as to the procedure to be adopted.373. We consider that in most cases tenants were adequately Compensation pensated when they left the land, and in any case no grievance ^ce^o?&quot;1 b* ains which the passage of time has not already adjusted.  But Tenants, spect of compensation clue to tenants who may originally have occupying the land when it was alienated, and who are still -if there are any such cases we consider that no distinction id be made between the treatment meted put to them and to -holders.374.

The case of the Dorobo deserves consideration are satisfied that, generally  speaking, they did not interj relinquish all then rights in Kikuyu country.  Most of thei now been absorbed, but there are still a few who live reserve independently or in the forest near Kijabe.  &quot;We con,; that they have established a right in equity to be received the Kikuyu Deserve.   We do not think it practicable to reed mend that the Dorest Department should be required to pc them to continue indefinitely to live in the forest and we eons, that a small additional extension of the reserve is advisabl order that accommodation may be found for them in the re; without hardship to the resident population.  We recommend they should not be bound to occupy this block, but that administration should charge itself with the duty of finding for them, and we expect that little difficulty will be experieu37G. In sum, our recommendations in respect of conipe tion for disturbance and loss of private rights outside the res are as follows : 377. In addition to the area which we shall recommend ti added to the reserve in compensation to the tribe for land; we recommend a further addition of 2,000 acres which shouKi regarded as comprehensive compensation for disturbance and I of amenities occasioned by the alienations, and a further i acres as a provision of land so that the tribe may acconsnscj certain Dorobo now7 living in forests near the tribal borders, also recommend a monetary compensation of  2,000 to be through the Native Councils to natives who are still living alienated land as of right.378. On the other hand we recommend that upon paymeil compensation  and after standing crops have been reapei private rights of Kikuyu outside the reserve should cease e?1 such as are held upon title or such as may have been acquin another reserve under the system of land tenure obtaining the native custom of the tribe concerned.379.

No. 160) comprising 945 acres, remained n island of unalienated Crown land in the middle of the farm ..[382. It is evident from the records that its reservation from nation had nothing to do with any question of native rights, was due to an oversight.383. In 1916. Mr. G. A. S. Northcote, then District Com-iioner, Kiambu, proposed that Tigoni be made a township and le then it has been  generally known  as Tigoni  Township prve.[384. In 1925 Mr. W. P. G. Campbell, District Commissioner, nbu, proposed to move the natives, who were by this time Sing at Tigoni in very considerable numbers without specific [orization.pis5. The Provincial Commissioner, Mr. C. M. Dobbs, raised jp;estion of native rights, and in December of the same year fr H. W. Gray, who had succeeded Mr. Campbell as District lissioner, proposed that the matter should be settled by coin-ling the githaka owners.1SS. In 1926 the Chief Native Commissioner claimed the area le native reserve, but the Commissioner of Dands opposed the 3c;: t ion on the ground that it was not geographically connected it.187. In June, 1930, the Secretary of State referred to Tigoni despatch to the Governor, and expressed the opinion that it il be held for &quot;native requirements, compensation or other.&quot;88. We are satisfied from the evidence that about the year the land was almost uninhabited. There appears to have a small village or possibly only one hut near where the
Police Station is now and a tew other huts dotted about in neighbourhood, but lew or none of them were within the boi aries of the area in question.389. In later years, as they gradually realized that this I island had been left apparently forgotten in the middle ol farm area, natives began to filter into it from homes which had occupied on the farms before they were alienated, and from the reserve. By 1923, according to the Hut Tax Census, had reached the number of 312 persons, and by 1932 this ti; had been almost doubled and there were 607 persons on the] a density of 411 to the square mile.390. The native evidence represents that there were ten ill on the land, all bought from a Dorobo named Kimunyi. A so this Kimunyi appeared before Mr. Lydekker, District Office! 1921, and admitted the sale. While we are not impressed bv statements as to the tale of goats paid over, it appears prolia in view of all the evidence, that the Kikuyu had been engaged a gccd number of years before the famine in the process of rer ing the Borc-bo on the land, and in this case it would appear the process had not been completed when the famine occurre391. It appears from evidence given to Mr. Lydekker tit son of the Dorobo &quot;vendor&quot; and one other Dorobo still had i.&apos;i of their own on Tigoni in 1921.392. The most probable conclusion is that the Kikuvn already acquired some rights in the land before the famine, the amount of bush which admittedly covered the land in 1 shows that the occupation can never have been very effect When the famine occurred they left the area and did not re: &apos;to it in any considerable numbers until after the surroun; farms had been alienated.  This is our finding on the facts.393. The expediency of allowing these natives to reniait this island in the middle of the Limuru farm area has 1 challenged not only by the European settlers of the neighbour: but also by successive District Commissioners at Kiantbu. have tepreferted that in the interests of the natives themseft; would be far better for the reserve to be consolidated. In J 1930, the District Commissioner wrote as follows on the sul of the Administrative difficulties which are occasioned by out! fragmented portions of the native reserve : &quot;I do not &quot;think it is necessary to labour the point such islands are most prejudicial to the efficient admin:-tion of the district.   It is a district in which tribal c has become weakened by the individualism of some o younger generation and the District Commissioner ha:KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter X] Exchanges, Ahjustmeni

But this becomes difficult when the orders operate harshly. When-eyer these &quot;islanders&quot; move out of their island without a registration certificate they are liable to arrest.&quot;394. With these views we agree. His general proposal was it the Tigcni land should be surrendered in exchange for a block forest land so situated as to join the Lari Native Reserve with i main reserve, and so eliminate two &quot;islands&quot; by a single tParge. Ike Conservator of Forests has agreed to this proposal th certain minor modifications.395. The basis of exchange proposed was :  (a) IJ acres for every acre.(fa) Compensation for ordinary round hut in the form of exemption from one year&apos;s tax on the hut.ic) Compensation for a better-class hut or house to be a cashcompensation ad valorem.id) Compensation for 23lanted trees (i.e., gums and wattles)at a cash valuation.(e) Each githaka holder on the land surrendered to be allowed to choose whether he will take his substituted githaka in the northern extension block, which is of high altitude, or iu the other blocks, which are lower, but not to be allowed to choose the precise locality which should be at the discretion of the District Commissioner and the local Land Board.(.0 Compensation for wire fencing, if any, at a cash valuation.lq) Sufficient time to be allowed for the move to be conducted without hardship or inconvenience.&apos;-)%. We are satisfied from the records that every care was en in putting these proposals before the natives. No less than ee barazas were held, the first two to explore the position and last to ascertain the opinion of the natives upon the proposals, are satisfied that the natives fully understood their nature and tils, and the representatives of six out of the ten ithaka agreed, &quot;agreement of one of the six, however, was contingent upon a of land being found for him in the forest reserve near

We consider it to be a fact that the giUiaka holdea now for the most part withdrawn their agreement, but we ascl this principally to the extravagant hopes which the appointrtj of the Commission has raised.398. Afer considering the evidence and the represent:!! made from all quarters, we believe it to be to the advanta^J these natives and the reserve its a whole that they shou ordered to quit Tigoni and be accommodated and compensate the manner suggested above.399. Kithirioni is an island of native reserve of seventy surrounded by the Lari Forest Reserve.  We are satislietl thai is in the lest interests of the inhabitants that they should moved from their isolated position&apos; and be consolidated with rest of the reserve, conditions in regard to compensation 1: the same as for Tigoni.  This could be done by moving them a three-quarters of a mile north of their present home into an adjacent to the Lari Native Reserve.400. The position of these natives differs from that of T in that their land is native reserve, and they cannot be i unless the Lands Trust Ordinance is amended.   But in a part of this report we shall make proposals for an amendn; whereby advantageous exchanges would be possible, subject the consent of the Local Native Council and the Lands T; Board.401. The total compensatory area required for Tigoni Kithirioni at an allowance of an acre and a half for an acre wj be 1,522 acres.   This has to be added to the area of the sen] compensatory addition.402. We, therefore, recommend that 1,522 acres be adde the reserve in the Bathi River area, so as to form a coir: between the Lari Reserve and the main reserve in the pi shown on the sketch map opposite page 24 of the printed evii This would have the effect of consolidating the reserve, natives moved from Tigoni and Kithirioni should be offered I choice of occupying the land, but if they prefer to take compensation in one of the other compensatory blocks which shall recommend to be added to the reserve, we do not think they should be precluded from doing so, and we note that son: them have expressed a preference for Muguga.403. The White Sisters obtained a lease in 1912 of cerj land containing an area over which the natives claim rights, of the western boundary adjoining the reserve was never beace]

Mr. Isaac&apos;s line was never called in question until the yor demarcated the reserve boundaries in 1928 and estab-1 the line as shown on the deed-plan.. The natives resented the surveyors demarcation which interpreted as an attempt to take 80 acres of their land, and ered by claiming not only that land but 300 acres to the of it, namely, L.O. 295/6 and 295/8, land which in 1931 the e Sisters schl to a Mr. Gumoes.   Both claims rely on pre-tive right, and also section 31 of the Crown Lauds Ordinance, and section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915. Of). We need not concern ourselves with the 300 acres or the still more ambitious claims which have been made ou rea since the Commission assembled. We have already deter-d the extent to which the Kikuyu were in occupation (section107. But the d0 acres constitute a special case.   The con-ences of Mr.  Isaac&apos;s mistake have been that this area  is ty covered with dwellings, and some at least of the natives ent there appear to have been in continuous and unchallenged ation from about 1913 until 1928 when the mistake in the dary was discovered.  They must be held to have established scriptive right.  It would not be fair to move them without generous compensation.   We recommend that, in order that essary disturbance may be avoided, the 80 acres be bought the White Sisters, either by agreement or, if necessary, under -and Acquisition Act, and added to the native reserve as a f the lands to be added in general compensation to the tribe.08. The land now occupied at Kabete by the Government (3) The Gov-(L.O.

KIKUYU 1&apos;ltOVINCE Past 1 Chapter Xj Exchanges, Adju.stmk.nt3(4) L.O. 383/1, &quot;the Kiheiiko Land.&quot;409. The contention of the natives is that this was not a exchange for two reasons : Firstly, that the areas given in change were originally Kikuyu territory, and that it i5 sufficient compensation for the loss of two pieces of Kikuyu tt tory that Government should refrain from alienating throe o: pieces; secondly, that the original mbaris who had lived on three other pieces naturally took possession and resented any trusion by the mbaris dispossessed of the land alienated for Government Farm.410. Since all the three areas added in exchange are inch within the boundaries of the area which we have found to 1 been &apos;&quot;unequivocal Kikuyu territory&quot;, we cannot but agree; the Kikuyu that the arrangements made for compensation \ not satisfactory, and that the undertaking to compensate has to be honoured.411. It is understood that the families concerned are Mbari ya Nyungu and other inbaris mentioned in claim No. s412. On the alienation of the land many of these nal went to squat on Karen Coffee Estate, where they remained October, 1931, when they were evicted. Government, bavins apprised in advance of the intention to evict, made arrange!) for their temporary accommodation in three blocks in the Di etti Forest area.413. We shall include these blocks in the land which we; recommend to be added to the reserve in general eompensatioj] the tribe.  We do not consider it necessary or advisable that statutory or defined private rights should be created for mbari in independence of the Administration, but we recomi that the block be added to the reserve as a whole. We conn the case of these particular mbari to the Administration an mark that an obligation lies to ensure that they are sui accommodated, and, in so far as may be practicable or genetl desirable, we recommend that an area be set aside for the; not less in extent and value than the area originally lost.414. There were right holders on the land alienated t Africa Inland Mission at Kijabe, and most of them were oil mbari known as Kiheriko.   It was assumed that the wl them %vere of that mbari, and an arrangement was made beh the ARssion and the Kiheriko whereby the Mission surrendti 400 acres of land to them in consideration of being quit further claims.   The agreement, dated 10th February, 1930, signed by sixteen senior representatives of the mbari.41.5. The Principal of the Mission has agreed and has carl out the undertakings.  The survey has been completed; the j
KIKUYU PROVINCE i Chapter X] Exchanges, Adjustments, Etc.been altered; and the rent payable by the Mission has been ced in proportion.116. There has proved to be a catch in this arrangement, in it has been discovered that some of the natives claiming t-hoklings on the place were not of the Kiheriko clan, and the eriko are refusing to let them have a share in the 400 acres.417. The form of agreement which was dated 10th February, , was signed on the one hand by the Assistant District Com-practitioner, Kiambu and the District Surveyor, and on the other by various natives representing the Kiheriko mbari. It is ie effect that the elders and representatives of the Kiheriko&quot;in consideration of the voluntary surrender by the Africa nd Mission of 400 acres of leasehold at Kijabe for the bene-1 occupation of our clan . . . the boundaries of which landthis day been clearly pointed out to us . . . hereby renounce lately on behalf of ourselves, our families and heirs, all claims lever to the Mission at Kijabe, under 86 (i) . . . or any r . . .&quot;418. The Field Director signified the assent of his governing - in a letter to the District Commissioner, Kiambu, dated 3rd -, 1929. In that letter he agreed to surrender 400 acres to eminent &quot;for the use of the Kiheriko clan&quot; subject to certain tliticns, of which the most important was &quot;that the relinqnish-t of this area shall satisfy in full all claims of previous oc-jnts of the land now comprising the Mission Estate.&quot;419. YVe are satisfied that both the Field Director of the slon and the District Commissioner were under the mis-ehension that there were no other right holders to be com-ated except the &quot;Kiheriko clan&quot; and that in drawing up the &apos;n:ent the District Commisioner intended the &quot;Kiheriko clan&quot; ever all the native right holders on the estate, and w-e have his rarice that it never occurred to him that the document couldany other significance than a complete extinguishing of lative rights on the estate in consideration of the surrender CO acres to Government to be used for the beneficial occupa-of the natives affected. We are satisfied that the Mission Id not have agreed on any other terms.420. In all the circumstances we consider it right to recom-d that this area be added to the reserve without any special nation.of private rights. We consider that, in administering land, due regard should be given to the claims of the Kiheriko, o far as may be practicable, but that they should not be ed to over-ride the claims of other natives wdio were resident fright, and who appear to us in equity to have equal grounds

Mr. Calderwocd sen ting the executive of the Mission, and expressed the willing! of the Mission to surrender 2,000 acres of land to the Xa Reserve on certain conditions. The first condition was thai area surrendered be permanently secured to the Kikuyu people their use and occupation. There would naturally he no obieo to accepting that condition.424. The second condition was that prior consideration sli be given to those natives now residing on the Mission hint1 have, or may be presumed to have, a legal claim under the Lands Ordinance, together with those who have left the estat times past, but who were in occupation when the Mission acq the land and who may now wish to return.   The descend;1.!; such original occupiers were also included.   It was asked in tion that the present Mission squatters, many of whom have 11 on the Mission land for a long period, but who are not origin occupiers, should not he deterred from settling on the surremie portion should they so desire.425. The third condition, which was a request rather thai condition, was that githaka rights may be restored, if possible those who originally had them.  And if it is not possible to resti
il-CHAPTER X]KTKTJYU PROVINCEExchanges, Adjustments, Etcover the whole of the land, then it was asked that they be red over part of the land, and that the mbari.? of Hinga, Muturi li), Wahothi and Wagithukn in particular should have ithaka. 420. The final condition was that  the residue of the land ining to the Mission should all become freehold. 27. While we regarded this offer as generous and had much athy with the intention underlying these proposals, we could gree that it is a, fair stipulation that the private rights of es should be made the subject of a bargain between govern-and the Mission, so that the rights safeguarded by the. in must necessarily prevail against claims, perhaps equally rounded, which may be advanced by other natives.   There as it happens, disputed family claims on this estate, as is 11 in Nos. 1, 2 and 8 of the &quot;Mbari&quot; claims  (Evidence, 65/268). But even if there were no such points of contention, a guarantee would clearly be unwise, since it would result in reation of an anomalous form of tenure in this particular part e district, which would impede the process of adapting the l;a system in conformity with modern requirements. 28.  Wo   therefore  arranged  a   further  interview   with   the ion authorities and represented to them that it would be ruble that the area should be added to the reserve without al conditions.  We gave our assurance that our Eeport would lin recommendations for safeguarding the private rights of es, and would also propose the introduction of rules for giving security to tenants in Kikuyu (vide section 517 below and ITT passim).   Belying on this assurance. Dr. Arthur, the rator of the Mission, agreed to surrender the 2,000 acres for ion to the reserve without any special conditions as to tenure. 29. We recommend that in consideration of the surrender of &apos;0 thousand acres the residue of 1,000 acres remaining to the on should all be freehold, any incidental cost of conversion or y being borne by Government.:&apos;S0. In section 474 below we shall make a recommendation would have the effect of connecting the Ndeiya grazing area i area surrendered, by means of a corridor consisting of about dred acres of land excised from the Dagoretti forest Eeserve. 31.

For some years before 1931 natives had ceased to ot, this land, and in January of that year Government authorize alienation to the Huai Sisal Company, but with the proviso the question of compensation must remain open for considera433. Since we are now proposing to compensate the Kikn another manner (namely, by block additions in other qmt, equivalent to the balance of loss suffered by the tribe), thee to this area should be allowed to lapse.434. L.O. 4961, generally known as Paul Clarke&apos;s Far: an area of 669 acres which w&apos;as granted in freehold in 1901 was not occupied except for a short period in 1906 when Go ment used it for depasturing cattle captured in the Embu Ex tion. It changed hands twice, and came into the ownersht Mr. Paul Clarke, who first began to develop it in 1925, twenty years after its first alienation.435. The natives promptly protested. The farm is comp surrounded by Native Reserve, and they have been using i as any other part of the reserve. They stated that the reason they had not protested when the farm was originally alienate, that they had known nothing of it.436. These representations were considered by Coven with the result that Mr. Clarke was compensated by a gran land elsewhere, and L.O. 4961 reverted to the Crown. Thei claim of right was met by a proportion of the farm ainounti 276 acres being set aside for their use, but it was not gazetl Native Eeserve. An acre and a half of the remainder has been teased to the Maragua Electric Power Company. T! mainder of the land (approximately 391A acres) ranks as cupied Crown land.437. Because the land falls -within the area which we found to have been Kikuyu territory and because it is em surrounded by gazetted Native Reserve, we recommend tli whole of it be gazetted as Native Eeserve, and that the re the leased area be paid to the Local Native Council.438. L.O. 325/B, Saba-Saba, Limited, lies outside tin which we have found to have been Kikuyu territory, and the ence shows that as late as 1908 there were only a very few Ki huts on it (compare the evidence of Mr. F. PL Jordan ami Seth Smith at section 195).

Since we have found that the land lies outside the bound-s of what was effective Ivikuyu territory, we are not greatly expressed with the claims to right holdings.Ml. A suggestion made by the District Commissioner is that I .C00 acres which are now under native occupation (in the tion shown on the plan attached to his evidence) be acquired  aba-Saba, Limited, and added to the reserve. He considers this could be done by offering them 1,000 acres elsewhere.112. Tn view of all the circumstances we recommend that this one or that the land be purchased, and we consider that theadded to the reserve must be understood to form part of the ral condensation to the tribe, and that the block addition may educed accordingly.443. There is also a small matter of 22 acres of the farm which o the north of the Public Works Department main road (Thtka brfc Hall). They are included in the farm, according to the deeds, but in the reserve according to the gazettement of 1926: the deposited plan which accompanied the gazettement agreed the title deeds and not with the gazettement. The District missioner states that the natives have been in beneficial occupa-since 1908 and must, in his opinion, be held to have acquired escriptive right. We consider that the 22 acres ought to be lit from the farm and added to the reserve.444. L.O. 1322, Dagoretti Township Reserve, has been ex- (9) L.O.. 1323, ed from the Native Reserve.

Njengu salt-lick is part of the South Nyeri X ^ Reserve and is joined to the main reserve by a road of access appears that squatter stock from the North Nyeri settled I also use this salt-lick and, since they belong to Kikuyu, it isj certain that the natives do not grudge them this facility. ] necessity for proper control to prevent infection makes it nece; to recommend that a part of the salt-lick be kept for the tis-squatter cattle. We consider that the exact arrangements car effected by negotiation and there is no occasion for any deta recommendation on our part, but we agree with the general oh of the proposal. There is no need for excision and the method be either by setting aside or by lease.There has also been a proposal for changing the line o; proach to the salt-lick, and the recommendations of the witnc stand on the record of the evidence (p. 512). We commend general lines of the proposal of the Mount Kenya Associatioi the consideration of Government and suggest that, when a able alternative route has been found it should be two htm! feet wide. The required adjustment should then be made by change under the enabling clauses which we shall recommenc be included in the Lands Trust Ordinance.447. The salt-lick in Nyeri Township is claimed by the nat: but in view of the evidence we have received we do not cons that a case has been made out for excising it from the town: and adding it to the Native Reserve. There are strong med objections to the use of the salt-lick by the natives, and we tf that such a matter should be one which the township author: should decide themselves.448. There is a piece of land at the south-west come: Ndeiya which the Kikuyu loan to the Masai in exchange piece of land to the south-east of Ndeiya, near the Dagorj Forest.  This is nominally an annual arrangement and it is to] mutual convenience of both parties; it has been suggested permanent exchange, somewhat on the lines of the present ment, might be effected.  We shall return to the consideration this matter in sections 701 and 709 below, when we are de with the Masai Province.449. There are various minor adjustments which could ea have been made by exchange, if the Lands Trust Ordinance provided a machinery for exchanges. We consider that we s! discharge our duty in respect of these cases if we recommend; able provision to be made in the ordinance, and it is not nece-;

There also cases where approved additions to the reserve have not been made because of difficulties in the ordinance, for whichhall have to propose a remedy.450. We now turn to the consideration of special cases which ;de exceptions to our general recommendations that com-ation should be paid in land up to the full value of the land The reason for regarding the following cases as exceptional at the land surrendered has, in whole or in part, been applied -rvices for the direct benefit of the natives.451. The total acreage alienated to missions or educational tutions within the area which we have found to have been cuyu territory&quot; may be assessed at 7,939 acres as shown in appendix 3.  These institutions are of direct benefit to the Kikuyu, on that ground a claim might be based that the whole of these s should be &quot;placed, so to speak, on the free list, that is to say, we should not recommend any compensation to be paid use of them.  AVe do not, however, take that view entirely, distinguish two classes of such land, namely, land necessary he mission or other educational institution to discharge its tions satisfactorily, and land which has been granted as a es of endowment.   Since agricultural instruction is an im-nt part of the training, the acreage falling in the first of these ories is fairly large, and provision for the houses and gardens si dent native adherents of the mission may occupy a con-able area in some cases.   Moreover, a plantation of wattle rewood is generally required.  Taking these points into con-lion we have agreed to regard 2,300 acres as the total sum d actually required to enable all these institutions to fulfil functions.

Captain Wilson considered to be the best assessment while Mr. Ffemsted thought 2,100, we have agreed to compromise on the figure stated.52. All the remainder of the land we consider to fall under lead of endowment land, intended to be farmed at a profit der to provide funds for the mission, and in seme cases parts have been sold or sub-leased. We do not consider it right land of this character should be exempted from the scope of eneral recommendations that equal compensation must be for the Kikuyu in return for the land lost.Special Cases affecting thp Question  or Compensation.(1) Mission^ and Eduou-tionalInstitutions

But in regard to the 2,300 acres we consider that fication exists for putting them on the &quot;free list.&quot; Even h, might be objected that, however much the tribe as a whole have been advantaged, there were right holders who wen possessed, and therefore full compensation must be paid. \ land tenure has beccme truly individual, this objection would to be sustained, but as things were when the land was alien and as they still are, all uncultivated land, though subje &quot;rights&quot;, is at the disposal of the whole tribe for purposes of ing, and most of the land alienated to missions was of that This point has been considered in all its bearings in a pre chapter, and we are satisfied that no injustice will be cans, anyone by the course proposed.454.

366CHAPTER XI.OMMEND ATIONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE KIKUYU CLAIMS UNDER THE 3rd, 4th and 5th TERMS OF REFERENCE.60. The result of our summary in Chapter Yl was to show altogether 265- square miles of territory have been given by -ninent to the Kikuyu and IGOi square, miles have been taken , an apparent gain of 156 square miles to the Kikuyu.  But taking into account the comparative values of the land given a ken, we found that the value of what has been taken from \ikuyu is greater than what has been given to them by a , which we assessed as 19,520 acres of good agricultural land section 225). But in our review of special cases in Chapter X ave found that there are 3,000 acres of this land for which no ensation need be paid because the land is devoted to services ehalf of the Kikuyu.  The balance of land we recommend to be (1 to the reserve in exchange for land lost is, therefore, 16,520461. But this amount must be increased by 2,000 acres to be oned as a general compensation for disturbance; a further acres in connexion with the admission to the reserve of in Dorobo now resident in the Forest Reserve; and, if the itions proposed for the Tigoni and Kithirioni exchanges are ted, a further 1,522 acres to pjrovide for them. 62. On these figures the total in favour of the Kikuyu be-s 21,042 acres.   But in a calculation of this kind it is not le to be exactly accurate, and we consider that it is better me a round figure and call it 21,000 acres, and we recom-that this amount of land be added to the Kikuyu Native ve.

Consists with his duties as Conservator he could not, of course, recount) the surrender of any area, but he stated that, if the Commis regarded it as absolutely necessary in justice to the Kikuyti to: areas up to 21,000 acres, he would see what cotdd be done. .1 examining the situation he informed us that the areas show; the schedule above represent the limit of sacrifice which he sidered ought to be required from the Crown forests. In the of Nyeri Hill be stated that the surrender ought not to be templated unless it is made a condition of its addition to reserve that it be maintained as a native reserve forest res in so far as the area now covered with timber is concerned. V this condition we are in full agreement, and we recommend act ingly. It is a condition to which the Nyeri Local Native Cot had already agreed.469. In regard to Item 10 the Conservator informed ns the destruction of some valuable forest would be entailed, and it is only, the extreme importance of settling the Tigoni que; which induces him to contemplate the surrender as justifiab!470. In regard to the remaining items he informs us; generally7 speaking, he has selected areas which are scrub-eot rather than forest covered, but that it has been impossible for to find so great an extent of land without a very considered   sacrifice of valuable timber-planting areas. He considers t!:: would be impossible to find any considerable-further areas t out a disproportionate sacrifice of the oountry&apos;s assets in ft Forests.471. We are most grateful to the Conservator for his full frank statement of the position. We agree with the conelt that the items shown in the schedule should be regarded a; limit of sacrifice which the forest should be required to st saving only that, if in the course of demarcation further; areas can be found for the reduction of the deficit of 2,195;

We have no hesitation in recommending that the two Item 8: lienated pieces of Crown land near Saba-Saba Station known andi.O. 1957 and 1958 be included in the compensatory areas to added to the reserve. They form an awkward salient into the ve as at present gazetted and no application has been made heir alienation as farms. :473. The inclusion of L.O. 4961, formerly Paul Clarke&apos;s farm, Item 9. art of the compensatory addition may be assumed to be a controversial matter which needs no supporting argument, facts are set out in sections 434-437 above.474. The area of 670 acres recommended to be added from Item 14. Dagoretti Forest Eeserve comprises approximately 570 acres are at present in temporary permissive occupation by those hers of the mbari of Nyungu and others who were evicted Karen Coffee state (see sections 408-413 above). The re-ing one hundred acres are for the purpose of providing a idor to connect the two thousand acres surrendered by the ch of Scotland Mission with the Ndeiya grazing area, so ing to consolidate the reserve.175. We have recommended in section 428 above that the Item 15. rous offer of the Church of Scotland Mission to surrender 0 acres of L.O. 185 and 186 be accepted. We commend to the cial attention of the administration the protection of the te rights of those natives who are living on the area to be ndered or who may be in any way affected.170. Under Item 16 we have recommended the purchase of Item I0j cres of the White Sisters&apos; land. The reason has been stated ^q)\c^^^&apos; ction 407 above. We pronounce no opinion as to whether area could properly be held to be excluded from the lease On round that it was in native occupation or that natives have ed prescriptive rights on it, but we consider that it would ise to refrain from raising this issue and to buy the land at ir value.177.

Our recommendation that 78 acres of the British f Africa Wattle Estate land from Dagoretti should be bought on the statement and plan in the precis (Evidence, pp-13.&apos; But, if Government does not think it necessary to buy the 78 ac then we recommend that only the 20 acres be bought which subject to native claims, and that the balance of 58 acres provided in wdtatever way Government may prefer.479. Our recommendation that L.O. 1322 be included m compensatory land to be added to the reserve and the reason it have been given in sections 444 and 445 above.480. The nineteen items which we have recommended to added comprise 18,801 acres.  The areas selected tire conveniet close to populous parts of the Ivikuyu Native Reserve, and therefore a very appropriate set-off against the bind lost.  Tl: remains a balance of 2,199 acres to be found.It would be clearly desirable, if it is practicable, that in ni ing up this balance land should be selected which is equally c veniently situated. But there is a limit to the amount of 9 land available.We shall presently recommend, when we are dealing with economic aspect of the Ivikuyu land problem, that a very extern addition be made to the native reserve in another, and soraew remoter quarter, since no block of land of sufficient size is able in immediate proximity to the inhabited parts of the pres reserve.   In all the circumstances we recommend preferably (a) : That, if the land can be made available without difficiil the balance of 2,199 acres be selected alongside the m reserve in the same way as the other blocks recommended be added on grounds of right, and that this issue h separate from the economic issue and the extension which shall recommend for that cause ;but, if that is impracticable, then (b) : That the balance of 2,199 acres be merged in the v much barger extension which we tire recommending economic grounds, and that no separate account be taken it. In that event we do not consider that the Ivikuyu wo have been in any way ungenerously treated.481. Throughout this part of our Report we have been gut by the principles which we enunciated in the first chapter, made it quite clear there how we regard the matter.

KIKUYU PROVINCE j_Chapter XL] Settlement of the Claims of Rightto be developed as farms, and took what it considered to be nate steps to protect the natives from loss or undue disturb-It was inevitable in so young a country that the informa-on which Government acted should be imperfect, and there factors in the situation which were not appreciated.   Not was the native population more numerous than was sup-d  but it had a conception of land-tenure in which group-Is had a recognized existence, and the dispositions made by rnment caused in consequence a greater disturbance than was erly covered by the compensation which was paid.   Little iaint was made at the time, and very little actual loss was d to the generation immediately affected.   But not only has British Administration alleviated the forces which used to the growth of population in check, but the creation of a and market at Nairobi and the provision of a block of Euro-settlement round it have attracted large numbers of natives areas further north and created a considerable measure of congestion.1482. On balance of economic advantage the Kikuyu have ed considerably, but it is undeniable that difficulties have n about land.483. We therefore concluded that, whilst we could not regard  ikuyu as fully entitled as of right to full z-edress in the shape n addition of equivalent land, they are in equity entitled to ve sympathetic consideration and we decided, because of the ulties inherent in the situation described above, in the hope ttirg an end to all past rancours, to recommend an addition nd equal in value to that which in our opinion they had lost, e necessary land should prove to be available.484. After a full and careful examination which has been set &quot;n sufficient detail in Chapters II to V of this Report, wre ed that the required acreage was 21,000 acres, including the for the Tigoni and Kithirioni exchanges.   And we have sted certain areas where the required land can best be found.85. It is of the utmost importance that the settlement with  ikuyu should be definite and final and that, when these emendations have been carried out, the matter of their past arces should never again be reopened. If finality is not ed, our labours and those of many officers who have been ng at the problem for many years will have been in vain, absolutely essential for the peaceful administration of the yu that these grievances should be finally put to i-est. Unless re sure that this will be done, we shall regret having set our tares to this Report.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Paul I-Chapter XI j Settlement of the Claims or l(r486. We would point out that mere enlargement and gazetting of the boundaries will not secure finality. Thev iy gazetted in 1926, but that did not prevent the Kikuyu laying cla to land outside them, nor the Attorney General from holding t possibly the claims might prove to be good. In our view tiott short of an Order in Council can secure finality. What is wan is that, in return for the addition of land to the reserve equival to the land lost, all rights by Kikuyu to land outside the rese except rights held on title or rights held under customary tenure some other reserve, should be extinguished.

A PEELIMINAEY STATEMENTOE THE ISSUES. 87 In the history of Kikuyu claims of right which has just The Area, J * j j. -    i  j j    under Reviewcompleted the question of economic need was not included.  and thehat we failed to recognize that economic need may of itself Objects of thefitute a claim of equal validity to a right based on historical Survey, lids, especially in a country where Government is enjoinedfder in Council to have due regard to native interests. But eemed it best not  to complicate the issues, and we havefore held over that aspect of the matter for separate con-ation, to which we shall now proceed.88. The object is to provide the answers to three principal dons : (1) To what extent the needs of the tribe in respect of and can be.met by internal adjustment.(2) Whether further extensions of. the tribal boundaries over and above the extensions already- recommended are likely to be required within the period which we ought to contem-plate.(3) Whether arrangements external to the reserve are -required in order that individuals or groups may have facili-ies to use land outside the tribal boundaries.89. While all these questions clearly fall within the scope of erms of reference, in respect of the first of them it is not to fix the limits of the ground to be covered. We do not der that we are expected to go into all the details of land e and economics, but there are certain aspects of the matter h we ought to cover as being vital to the general objects of leport :  &apos;(ft) We cannot reach any useful conclusion as to the needs of the people in respect of land, unless we know how they use the land which is already&apos; theirs, and whether, in fact, a shortage of land exists or is threatened.(6) An apparent shortage of land may often be due to a lack of skill in the use of land, and the possibilities of setting this right have to be explored before it is necessary to turn the eyes outward and look for more land. In so far as we think that the land is not being used to the best advantage we ought to say so.

It nun-due to some unsuitability in the land system wh prevents the distribution of the population to the 1 advantage. It is, therefore, necessary to consider, in broad aspects, the method of tenure, a duty which specifically enjoined on us under the first term reference.490. We shall content ourselves with such a summary of evidence as will make clear the reasons for our recommendatio but we shall not commit ourselves to any comprehensive sur of the economic position. Such a course would involve us in acceptance or rejection of estimated figures which, as the witne; who gave them are the first to admit, have not been so f ascertained as to be free from challenge.491. At the same time we draw attention to the mass relevant evidence which is printed along with this Report, express the belief that Government will find in it some v valuable material, which should be of great assistance to it devising a policy and programme for future advancement.
372CHAPTER XIII.SUMMARY OF THE ECONOMIC POSITION IN THE KIKUYU RESERVES.492. The following summary of the present economic position is to us to be justified on the evidence : (1) Skill. Judged by European standards, the Kikuyu is not Summary of ood farmer, but he is well above the average of East African Economic1^ es. Pie has begun to respond to the tuition of the Agricultural Position, cers, and in Kiambu District the yield of maize to the acre isted to have increased by twenty per cent in the last six rs.(2) Monetary Resources. The tribe has enough money to according to the old standards, but not enough to enable it attain to the new standards by which alone a healthy people, ful to the Colony as a whole, can be maintained. This lack of ley is mainly to be ascribed to a lack of agricultural skill. But re are certain areas where there is a local congestion and a sequent lack of land.(3) Food Sup-ply. The vegetable diet which the household ives from its gardens may be regarded as satisfactory, and is tainly v\ ell ahead of most other tribes and a great improvement anything the Kikuyu knew before the coming of the white man.The local meat supply is probably inadequate. The physique the Kikuyu and the Masai have been compared in a report byGilks and Dr. Orr, entitled &quot;Studies in Nutrition. The &apos;sique and Health of Two African Tribes&quot; (Special Report ies 155, 1931). In this report it is stated that the Kikuyu are cient in animal protein.If the Kikuyu were skilled in stall-feeding they could keep e cattle, and if they had more cash and more markets they Id buy more meat. And if they could get over their prejudice inst goats&apos; milk they would have more milk. But things being they are, there is a deficiency in these things in spite of thestocking of the reserve.This is pro tanto an indication that the Kikuyu are living at great a density for their present degree of skill and knowledge. (4) Stock Conditions. It is perhaps a point of doubt whether re is. overstocking, but there is certainly very full stocking, le areas are certainty overstocked. Belief could be found by ing off a portion of the male stock, but it would be imprudent this stage to attempt too drastic a reduction, since there must i reserve of grown cattle to augment the meat supply.
KIICUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter XIII] The Economic As(o) Soil Conditions. The density at which the people living has to a great extent prevented the practice of shifting ci vation and frequent fallowing of large stretches of laud. \y this will ultimately lead to a better and more economic us laud, there is grave risk that, until natives have adapted th selves to the new conditions and realized the necessity of A ploughing and manuring, there will be considerable deterioration of the soil through exhaustion, and definite signs of tins 1 already appeared., (fi) Social Conditions. The tribal organization of the Kit; has never been strong. The main clans are scattered in si units. Even the mbari or family groups are often sub-diva; The process of disintegration is most advanced in the Kian District, where it is generally allowed by custom that a man r separate from his cousins and divide the githaka, and instance partition, even between brothers, are beginning to appear. YV these movements in the direction of individualism are perhap be welcomed as a sign of progress, nevertheless, some embarr ment has been caused hy the rapidity with which the old hist tions are breaking down and giving place to a civilization impede understood by the people.(7) Conclusion. Congestion does not exist as a general coi tion, but only in certain areas and in certain particulars: (a) There are fairly wide areas in which the population living beyond the optimum density in the sense that it had more room, the cultivation per family would greater. Local foci of congestion also occur in locati which are not congested over all.(6) The people in several parts are more thick on the i than is suitable to their present degree of skill methods of combating soil erosion and exhaustion.(c) The present degree of skill does not permit of the peckeeping sufficient stock for its requirements with overstocking and deterioration of the land.(d) Such congestion as exists is due rather to maldisiribu;of population and lack of skill than to lack of land, an increase of skill may be expected for some year; to result in a raising of the standard of life, even thoi the population is increasing.Future 493.

. KIKUYU PROVINCE I Chapter XIII] The Economic Aspecttion of witnesses could be directed, we have been guided r by the nature of opinions expressed upon them, especiallydministrative and agricultural officers of experience, than bycogencv in the figures themselves.494. The survey prepared &apos; by Mr. Kazan, District Commis-er, with the assistance of Mr. Deckle and Mr; Dates, Agri-ral Officers, concludes with the following expression of ion : &quot;The future of the  next  thirty  years or so may be imagined as a race between the tendency of a growing popula-ion  to congest the land and a growing skill to make the ame land support a larger population.   During the earlier ears of the period skill will be in the lead and&apos; result in greater individual prosperity.  But the rate of betterment will ecline and it seems likely that in about twenty years from low (unless remedial measures are taken) approaching con-?estion will depress the standard of life as much as growth in kill will raise it.   After that a Jong flat top to the graph is be best we can expect.

The survey was sent to the Director of Agriculture and ork of criticising it was entrusted to Mr. Blunt, Acting ty Director, whose reply, which is filed in evidence, indicates 11 agreement with this opinion.9G.

We cannot but attach great weight to these opinions and rcful memoranda in which they are presented.  Nobody pre-that the. factors in the account are precisely ponderable or that factors will not appear, but we cannot ignore wdiat appears a well-grounded and apparently unanimous opinion by all the istrative and  agricultural  officers of the Kikuyu districts,

The survey expressly excluded from its scope the lem which may be created by the return of squatters iron! European area together with their cattle. It is represented there are about 110,000 Kikuyu now resident outside the rese most of whom are squatters. Although this figure has not substantiated, we can take it as a sufficient general indie (see note at the end of this chapiter). It is scarcely to be sup] that the European area will always afford accommodation foi the squatters and their natural increase or for their stock. \\ nobody can foretell how many extra labourers expansion o cultural industry may be able to employ, there is at leas; indication that the numbers have for several years been in e of requirements, and there has been a set of the tide back tov the reserves. This tendency, although it may be only a tempo! phenomenon due to the current depression, has caused a justif apprehension, and it is possible that it may become a pr-ohlei the first magnitude how and where accommodation is to for squatters who are surplus to the requirements of the Euroj Highlands. Even a large expansion of industry would not sor solve the problem as give it another complexion, for while labourers would be required, the enhanced value of the would render it uneconomic for employers to allow large area, squatter cattle, and it is probable that labourers on contract yr begin to replace the squatters.499. Official figures given in the Annual Report of the DejJ merit of Agriculture for 1932 show 110,570 as the total &quot;squatters&quot;, including their families, employed in agricultural pastoral holdings in the settled area, but do not distinguish! tween tribes.

374CHAPTER XIV.IS0DSS1ON OP MEANS BY WHICH A BETTER USE COULD BE MADE OE THE LAND.500. If the Province is considered as a whole, including the Possibilities bu and Meru Districts, the land appears to be sufficient for the evW/to^rflm-le in the near future, and it is important to consider whether tiori of; ;&apos;&apos; ore even distribution is practicable as a-means of solving the Populated:J-&apos;-&apos; lem.  Even in Kikuyu proper the occurrence of local conges-would be relieved if more use were made of-the sparsely bited land along the western border and in the Mwea area, the desired movement is away from Nairobi and the farm ers and exactly contrary to the present tendency and the ction of economic pull.   An early change of direction is not able, and even an addition of land to the reserve:&apos;would only gate the situation to some extent.   There seems to be every pect that, as a permanent condition, the native population in parts of the reserve which are nearer to Nairobi will be living . degree of density which will put a severe-strain on the cture of native society including the githaka system.&quot;-&apos;501. We need not concern ourselves with examining the inistrative and agricultural measures wdiich may partially al-te the position, except to say that some valuable suggestions been made in evidence. But there are aspects of the case h may call for modifications in the system of land tenure, and e fall more directly within our. province.502. We have been asked to say whether the system of land e for natives should be on tribal or individual lines, and we lso asked to comment upon the working of the Dands Trust ance. A point which cannot fail to impress itself even on ost casual inquirer is that, in the condition-s of density which hreatened, it is absolutely imperative that the land should be to the best advantage, and that this is not only a problem ricultural utilization, but is also, and perhaps equally, a em of land holding. There must be no doubt as to who is the nsible authority for dealing with it, and it is clear that we of usefully criticise the working of the Ordinance unless we the nature of these problems and the manner in which&apos; the nsibility is being discharged.03. The land system of the Kikuyu is generally known as The Githaka &apos;Githaka. System.&quot; It is fully described in the report on system- .:. ive Land Tenure in Kikuyu Province&quot; by the Committee &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; -..&apos;&apos;printed in 1929, which we accept in general, as we have stated
KIKUYU PROVINCE Paut 1 Chapter XiV] The EconomicRecognition of the Githaka S^teiu.Certain Difficulties.Smallholdings and Sub-division.elsewhere, as an accurate account of the matter. It is not, th fore, necessary to describe it in detail, but for the sake of e reference, we give in Appendix No. 6 a number of extracts ft the report, arranged in such a way as to give a concise accoi of the system and especially of those aspects of it to whichI shall have occasion to allude.504. The effect of that report and of the evidence before i is to suggest that the githaka system is extremely epliemeJ There is no evidence whatever to show that even the githaka, which means bush, had acquired any technical sigriificaj when the Protectorate was declared. If the system has correctly defined as &quot;the methods of clan and patriarchal coral expressing themselves in relation to the land&quot;, it does not ?ej to have been very recognizably established as a method of holding in an agrarian sense even when some of the witnesses\i have appeared before us first came to this country. The extent its manifestation appears to have been rather in the nature ol political suzerainty over ridges. And yet, a bare forty years aft wards, we find that, at least in so far as the Kiambu District concerned, it is already in its decay. For the methods whi have come into use in that district are already a long tt removed from those of clan and patriarchal control. They mark an advance, but they are certainly a departure.505. What then is meant by recognizing the githaka systeJ Does it mean that the authentic system must be ascertained al followed, and that no new departures or transition to anotherfcl are to be allowed? This is certainly not what is meant. It wcl perpetuate a system which is in many ways unsuited to modi conditions, and erect a barrier against future progress. Wei satisfied from the evidence and memoranda before us that: opinion of all administrative officers concerned is unanimousl the point of principle. The principle is that it is better to t  the native customs as they stand and build from them as a than to rely on some novel but imported pattern which would I be urderstecd. But the need for progressive moderation anclfj trol is recognized.506. The Beport mentions certain ways in which the gill system is ill-adapted to rrcdern developments, and cites especi: difficulties in connexion with small holdings : security for tern: the proper use of pasture; permanent buildings, social sen centres; and townships.507. In respect of small holdings, it would be a complete a understanding of the position to assume that there is any in ten! of splitting up ithaka in order to create small holdings. Tt d be truer to say that the reverse is the case, and the probteij
to prevent ithaka from becoming disintegrated, and being fed into small holdings, which may again become sub-dividedthey are uneconomic. The danger is not so great in the - districts as it is in Kiambu, since in theory at least the ai remain intact and some power of redistribution remains the muramati. Nevertheless, the division of right-holdings heritance between all the sons may easily congest the holding, the practical scope of the muramati to adjust matters is dy small and will be increasingly limited as shares are moreely defined.08. But the worst difficulty appears in Kiambu, where in allows of the partition of ithaka between cousins, and there uiny examples of still further partition into small family rigs&apos; of a few acres in extent. When they become over-ded, superfluous right-holders may agree to go elsewhere, but will be less willing to do so as the difficulty of finding other becomes more pronounced. Even if they go, their rights in and descend to their heirs, though a practical limitation nts their returning to the land if there is not room for them, position is particularly embarrassing when permanent crops buildings are in question. The Report on Land Tenure in yu, while regarding the problem as a difficulty of the future r than of the present, admits the need for regulation, and rks that &quot;the problem is not remote, but very near&quot; (Chapter ra. 28).09. It might be thought that congestion of this nature would to correct itself under the stress of poverty. But a man is ecessarily poor because of.the small size of his holding, since ay keep as many stock.as he likes on the common pasturage.10. A similar question receives attention in the Beport of toyal Commission on Agriculture in India (1928) and the -ing opinion is stated (p. 130) : -&quot;The sub-division of right holders&apos; holdings is apt to be arried to such an extent that the resultant holdings become oo small to maintain the right-holder and his family in a standard of comfort vaguely described as reasonable.&quot; 11. While it is obvious that this practice of sub-division is ated to aggravate the problems of local congestion, attempts Tern it by rule might result in an undue dislocation of popuhi-at a time when other agricultural right-holdings are hard to nd there are ro derivative industries in the reserve capable of birg any considerable number of the population. 12. Nevertheless, the position may become so serious that, terms of tenancy can be rendered more attractive, many holders on overcrowded ithaka may prefer to go and live asKIKUYU PROVINCE I Oiiaptku XIV] Tun Economic Aspect

We invite special attention to remarks which stand evidence on the subject of &quot;dependent impartible holding (Evidence, pp. 1096-1098). The suggestions are worthy of sui but it is clear that any advance along those lines would have to very cautiously made.Fragmenta- 514. An heir who inherits both from his father and bis i,,tlon- gels two holdings.  The process is cumulative and there are imheirs who have several (perhaps a dozen) fragmented holdii which it&quot; is impossible to consolidate. There is no doubt whate but that many of these fragments are very small and in then generation will be uneconomic. While an excuse might pert be found for not tackling the problem of excessive sub-division the ground that possibly a landless class might be created pre turely, there is no such argument against the consolidation fragmented holdings. There is nothing whatever against it exc its difficulty. Again, the Report of the Royal Commission Agriculture in India gives us a forewarning of what we have expect, unless remedial measures are taken : &quot;Where the soil is of uniform quality or where differences in quality are not great, fragmentation is an of the first magnitude.&quot;One witness stated : &quot;The agricultural holdings of Bombay Presidency have to a large extent been reduced t condition in which their effective cultivation is impossible.The Commissioners concluded: &quot;Fragmentation of b ings is in many parts of India one of the most import factors tending to prevent agricultural improvements. Tl seems to be common agreement that its evil effects are great that the administration should not rest until a rent has been found . . . The initiative should not be left to spontaneous action of the right-holders . . . Difficulties shi not be allowed to become an excuse for inactivity.&quot; (pp.&apos; 144.)515. These factors are present in Kikuyu in a far less a form, and there is time for more detailed study before actio taken. Nevertheless, the evidence given to us by the Agrienlt Officers inclines us to believe that the position is serious, and some regulation will be necessary. The suggestion made ti a&apos;t our informal meeting with the Provincial Commissioner District Commissioners at Nyeri was that the remedy could p ably be found by increasing the powers of the muramati to solidate holdings on his githaka.   Such a method would h
KIKUYU PROVINCE T-Chapter XIV1 The Economic Aspectormity with the general policy of developing the native system meets the difficulty to a certain extent. But the root of the ble is that the fragmented holdings of one man are often Sited on several ithaka. 516. The practice of outright sale, which applies in the ibu District, will probably help to check fragmentation in district, although it may be expected to bring other difficulties s own.517. We are of opinion that more security must be found for Tenancy, nts and that they should not be evicted without compensation, also find it necessary to recommend that right-holders on sely occurred ithaka should not be allowed to refuse tenants out good cause.   In view of the terms of the trust it must eld that every Kikuyu has a right to live in the reserve in enable security, and the githaka system must not be so inter-ed as to refuse that right to anyone, f 518. Sales of land take place only in the Kiambu District, Sale, le the practice in the Nyeri and Fort Hall Districts is redeem-barter, which is the normal native custom.  The difference is result of circumstances and we see no reason why either area &apos; .id he asked to imitate the other.519. It would be a retrograde step to try to force the Kiambu yu back from the considerable degree of individualism to ch they have attained in their tenure of land. The draft rules ared by Mr. Maxwell, the late Chief Native Commissioner, been shown to us, and we note that the intention is to regu-eales of land by requiring the prior sanction of the Provincial missioner, a precaution which appears to us to provide an uate safeguard.520. It is clear to us from the evidence that the Kiambu net has for many years been used, as it were, as a sort of &apos; rsion area into which the Fort Hall District has poured some s surplus population. In spite of approaching local conges-s, which are already threatened, the force of the economic pull rds Nairobi is likely to continue for some time after an arrassing degree of density has been reached. It is probable a reasonable facility to buy and sell, under adequate safe-d, will help to preserve fluidity and assist the population to ibute itself to better advantage.521. If the practice of sale did not already exist in the Kiambu district it is impirobable that we should go the length of recom-ding its introduction. But it does exist, and we think that, erly regulated, it is likely to be useful.

As far as we can see from the evidence, the i District is already launched on a system of tenure quite exei in tribalism; It is not yet individual tenure, since the r; seems to be that cousins separate, but brothers do not, ; group is therefore rather wider than a single family:. Ai not even, in all respects, private tenure, since a right of coiiurit pasturage remains. But these restrictions are disappearing, individual tenure is well in sight.523. On the issue of tribal versus individual tenure we say no more than : (a) that in all the Kikuyu Districts the ter is certainty not tribal, but is a species of group tenure; (6) i the groups tire likely to become smaller, and that in the Kiai District individual tenure is well in sight; (c) that while devising of ah adequate means of control nitty well tax the genuity of the Administration, yet the emergence of inch tenure in the Kiambu District must be expected at no His; date, and it is likely that it would be neither wise nor practic to try and prevent it.524. Among the greatest difficulties which arise under gUliaka system is that there is no recognized method of sen aside areas for public purposes, which can well be copied. I true that there were arrangements for the creation of dancing grounds and for markets, but they do not afford in help. The whole matter is intricate, and we reserve it for cuss ion in the third part of our Report, in which we shall ( with it comprehensively in relation to all the native reset While the difficulties encountered in securing land for purpose social service are greater in Kikuyu than elsewhere, they are generally speaking, so different in kind as to demand sepa treatment. Tut the exceptional complications which have at about school and church plots in this Province require spe attention.525. We have had the advantage of hearing the evident the Director of Education and also of the Kenya Missioi Council and other witnesses, and we have been informed of vat resolutions which have been passed from time to time In-Local Native Councils and the Kiambu School Area Coiiim and the Local Land Board. While we have not ourselves time to make so close a study of the subject as would justifj in dealing w;ith it in the body of our Report, we wish to record general agreement with the conclusions reached by Mr. Faza a review of the subject which he has submitted in evidence, which we have included as Appendix No. 7 to our Report.526. While we realize the difficulties of creating private ri in areas such as Ndeiya and Mwea, where none are at pre
KiKUYU PROVINCEI-Chapter XiV]The Economic Aspect377nized, yet, we consider that large areas should not he used sheiy as grazing commonages, since they lead to large ac-aticrs of ine stock tar away from the homes of their owners, e they are useless as a source of milk supply; while, so long right of grazing remains common, no attempt is made to e the land or the pasture, which rapidly deteriorates.   The ciar.ee of private rights similar to those obtaining in the rest ie reserve would be generally desirable if a suitable method be found.i-27. The ccminon right of pasturage over githaka land also -. to ever-stocking, since small regard is had to the carrying city of the land. While it would not be practicable to advise the practice be stepped, we regard the appearance of private ccks, of which a few examples already exist, as a feature to licouraged under suitable safeguards.528. We have to face the fact that, unless remedial measures aLcn, a state of general congestion is threatened within thirty s. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the best attainable distribution of the population on the land, and it is clear that a t amount of agrarian adjustment has to be made, and that time is limited. On the other hand the whole nature of the leni calls for caution, and it is quite impossible that the er steps, which must largely depend for their success on a refshe education of the people, can be undertaken in a*i sphere of hurry. The responsible authority, therefore, has a delicate task in deciding the rate at which it is prudent to eed.529. In the correction of faults in an indigenous system ic innovations are unwise. The path to be followed is that regressive amelioration, and there is no reproach if the rres adopted bear a certain stamp of impermanence and ovisation. The task of directing a course of evolution is not a le one, and steps must necessarily be tentative and nothing be irrevocable.&quot;30. It is apposite to quote from a minute written by Sir las Munro on the land question in Madras in 1884 : &quot;It is a dangerous system of Government in a country of -hich our knowledge is very imperfect, to be constantly urged ry the desire of settling everything permanently, to do every-thing in a hurry, and in consequence wrong, and in our zeal for permanency to put the remedy out of our reach.&quot;531.

CHAPTEE XV.REQUIREMENTS EXTERNAL TO THE RESERVE.536. The effect of the economic evidence is to suggest that uiething in the nature of a general congestion is threatened in e Kikuyu District within thirty years, unless very great im-ovements in agricultural method and the holding of land take ce.   Improvement in so high a degree cannot safely be assumed, it is apparent that we cannot rely on internal adjustment ne, but that facilities in land external to the reserve will have e found.537. We shall pass briefly in review the various forms which assistance might take.538. We have recommended block additions amounting to 1)80 acres to be made permanently to the reserve in settlement the claims of right.   This addition has been recommended for removal of grievances, and not on economic grounds.  It will ve a certain economic effect, in that it will help to knit the reserve more closely together by the elimination of the &quot;islands&quot; Tigoni and Kithirioni and by joining the existing &quot;islands&quot; of and Ngarariga by corridors to the main reserve. It is also to hoped that the better spirit which is likely to be engendered in Kikuyu by the settlement of their past grievances will make iu more amenable to the advice and instruction given them by inistrative and agricultural officers.  But as a direct contribu-to the solution of a problem of incipient congestion the addi-of these compensatory blocks is clearly inadequate, and needs be supplemented by the addition of further blocks on economic ands.539. It is clear that no addition of territory, however large, by itself solve problems caused by density of population, if the illation continues to increase. All that it can effect is a certain ng of time, and the value of the addition depends on the use e of the time.540. If a population is showing signs of becoming economi-y minded; if it has begun to sweep aside agrarian restrictions ch have lost their uses and devise others which ensure the pation of the land to better advantage; if it has realized the lity of trying to secure particular pieces of land by a sort of ail to the same family for ever; if it has begun to build up native industries on the basis of agriculture instead of expect-every family to he supported directly from the growing of if it is showing a tendency to delay the age of marriageBlock Addition.

Alter considering these matters and having regard the actual areas available, we think that the addition of tins of some 350 to 4G0 square miles is warranted, and would be ofv, substantial assistance to the Kikuyu in affording them a resj during which they must ;earn to improve their methods of a. culture and land-holding so that, when the existing degree density is again reached, they will be better abie to late; position.

The Provincial Commissioner lave control but should be assisted by a special committee ing of the District Commissioners and the Senior Chiefs rresentatives of the various divisions of the districts of the be, whom he might consult either collectively as a full tree, or by districts.   We also recommend that one of the t officers, in addition to his ordinary duties, should hold a arj ointment as Land Settlement Officer of the area to under the orders of the Provincial Commissioner.   This should pay frequent visits and keep any books or registers may be found necessary.5. Private tenure already obtains in Kikuyu aud its de-er.t should Le encouraged. Consideration should, therefore, to the manner in which private rights may be. created in w area.e consider it advisable that the system to be adopted should both of group or family tenure on lines related to thesystem, and also of holdings on more individual lines, e jrcrcsals which we make in respect of tenure in &quot;C&quot;. n a subsequent part of our Report (Part III, sections 1880-vould be generally suitable to this area also.

Tt is most important that the land, both in the allocated and in the blocks awaiting allocation, should he protected

There are extensive areas of good agricultural land Masai Reserve in proximity to the southern border of Kiku\ i Masai make no adequate use of them, and it might be com that a lease to the Kikuyu should be arranged. But it is u that the Masai would agree, and any attempt to force their besides being in contravention of the agreement of 1911 \v specially preserved in section 8 of the Lands Trust Ordi would probably lead to ill-feeling which might tend to previous very considerable penetration by Kikuyu into Masailand wi present takes place by a natural process which is to the adv of both tribes.555. Not only do large numbers of Kikuyu women get mavricJ to Masai and Kamba husbands, but they often invite their relj tions to follow them, and in a general way, so long as the pace! not forced, both tribes are agreeable to this arrangement. To] less extent there is a penetration by Kikuyu into Ukanlba. Thea] movements do not occur to an extent which could in any wJ threaten the general security of the tribe into whose land the peal tration takes place. On the contrary it probably increases securig by creating better relations between the tribes concerned.55G. The density at which the Kikuyu are living is altogetli exceptional for Africa, and it is not surprising that land prohlenJ of great difficulty should have arisen.   We have not therefor! thought it disproportionate to devote a third part of our report i their solution.  We first addressed ourselves to the task of findinl a just settlement for existing grievances and then turned to th question of economic needs.   In order to provide for these need we have made proposals partly on tribal and partly on non-trite lines.   For the majority of the Kikuyu the shelter of the trite system will be necessary for many years and probably generation! to come, and we have, therefore, recommended a substantial esj tension of the tribal territory.   This will enable them to exp;. until they have had time to learn more skill in the use of hind anl make the land capable of carrying a larger population without hrfl pairment.  For the increasing number who will in course of tiinf desire to leave the tribal territory and go to areas where they ma hold land on more individual lines, we shall make proposals i Part III of Ibis Report that extensive areas be set aside in wliic natives shall have prior rights of taking up land on lease. Finallii we shall recommend  that the reservation  of land to party tribes shall rot be so rigidly interpreted as to prevent a safe exteri of peaceful interpenetration, in so far as the occupant tribe does ncj olvect and in so far as the customs of land-holdine permit, will give greater fluidity, and to some extent alleviate the difltcul ties arising frcm the present maldistribution of population on tit la nd.
K1KUYU PROVINCE _Chapter XV] &apos;Ihe Economic Aspect557. We believe that these remedies, taken together, will ible the Kikuyu to face the future with every prospect, if they i their opportunities, of becoming a prosperous tribe.558. We wish to invite attention t&apos;o the fact that, while on lance of value for value the Profit and Loss Account has revealed mail 1QSS to the Kikuyu amounting to 21,000 acres, which we v recommend to be made good, yet, if the balance be struck iply on extent of land, the territory which the. Kikuyu now upy is much greater than that which they occupied before vernnient came. Actions taken by Government at a time when urination was very imperfect may sometimes have resulted in -dship to the Kikuyu, owing to misconceptions of the numbers the population and their system of land tenure. But the result our examination has been to convince us that the hardships 1&apos;ered by&apos; the tribe have been vastly exaggerated, and that the sent economic problem, which is one of population-density, is directly due to Government action in constricting the bound-es, for they have in reality been expanded. But the economic ansion of the country has inevitably drawn population towardsmain centres of trade and employment, while the prevention of line and tribal wars and the better control of epidemics has loved the principal checks on population-increase.
CHAPTER XVI.Contrast of the Meru and Embu Prob-lems with those of Kikuyu Proper.The Boundary of the Meru Native Reserve.Land claimed between the Luguthu and Morania Rivers.LAND PROBLEMS OP THE MERU AND EMBI DISTRICTS.559. In the fifteen chapters just completed, we have o&amp; with the problems of the three districts of Kikuyu proper, an at of 1,931 square miles, inclusive of the Mwea area, with a popu] tion of approximately 489,156 persons living at a density of a proximately 253 to the square mile (vide section 67 above) contrast to them the Meru and Embu tribes, who are also of t same Province are a population only about half as numerous, habiting an area more than twice as large. Since the Protectors was declared they have been singularly&apos; free from disturbance any kind and they have no very serious or difficult land problen There are. however, a few matters which require to be mention shortly.560. The proposed boundaries of the Meru Native Reset were published for general information in 1925, but subseqneii! a modified boundary was approved, which had the effect of exclt ing the Tharaka settlements at Mutejwa, Kikingo and Matha frc the Meru Native Reserve. It was supposed at the time that excluded areas were very sparsely occupied land in which Aleru could not be said to have any legitimate claim. Subsequent representations were made which caused a reconsideration of t matter, and a reversion to the boundaries as provisionally gazett in 1925 was approved by the Governor in Council in March, 19:561. The natives were informed of this decision and boundaries then recommended are being observed in practice, recommend that the gazetted boundaries be amended to confo: with them. &quot;We understand that it is only because of cerfe formal difficulties in the Lands Trust Ordinance that this st has not already been taken, and at a later stage in our report-shall make proposals whereby this obstacle may be removed.562. The area affected in this case is 626 square miles.563. There is a piece of land which the Meru claim to i westward of their reserve. It is a strip between two rivers, be of which are often called the Morania, although it is correct call the western river the Alorania and the eastern the Lugntl The Luguthu is the boundary of the reserve as gazetted in 19: but the Meru claim the land as far as the Morania.564. In 1911, when it was thought with apparently gc reason that the land between these two rivers was Meru land:
KlKTJYTJ PROVINCE bt I-Chapter XVI] Embu and Meru Districtsonkl bo included in the Meru Native Reserve, the District Com-issiouer diverted the Luguthu by a furrow so that it ran further st through the grazing land of the Imendi section of the Meru. 565. In 3913 the land between the Luguthu and the Morania advertised for sale and one of the attractions was said to be It it was watered by the Luguthu.  Subsequently the gentleman Bio had taken up one of the farms (L.O. 4634) pmotested that he id been misled by Government inasmuch as the Luguthu had en diverted away from his farm and no longer watered it.566. Persistent attempts have been made by Government to tisfy both interests by returning the river to its former course id conducting a supply from another source into the furrow dug the natives. These efforts have met with very indifferent scess until the present year. But the Executive Engineer has w been successful in conducting a good supply of water to the tives&apos; furrow by means of a furrow taken from a tributary of ? Eazita Eiver.567. This furrow has been made at Government expense iu her respects, but the Meru have supplied labour free of charge, respect of the upkeep we understand that it is proposed that cost should be shared between Government and the Local dive Council.568. If the question of the furrow is regarded in isolation an ual sharing of the cost would be fair, since it can hardly be limed that the Meru, by the mere action of digging a furrow, d established a right to divert the Morania River or to receive mpensation in the form of an alternative supmly of water free all cost, if the Government should see fit to return the river to original channel.  On the other hand the furrow had been dug the direction of the District Commissioner, and that may fairly taken as establishing a right to special consideration.569. But wdiile a solution on the above lines is equitable if e matter of the water-furrow be considered in isolation, it ceases be so if considered in conjunction with the question of loss of nd. We are not impressed by the claim of the Meru that the nd between-een the two Moranias was theirs in the sense that they ade full and continuous use of it. It is probable, however, that ey made intermittent use of it for grazing purposes. Therefore, though we cannot admit then claim to the land, we agree that ey ought not to be deprived of the use which they had of it ithout some compensation. We consider that this compensation ould be found by Government meeting the full charges of the pply-furrow, both in respect of initial cost and maintenance, the eru, of course, continuing to be responsible for all charges in nnexion with their own furrow.
KIK.OYCT PROVINCEPart I Chapter XVI]Jiiiuu and AIeru DistihClaim in respect of isioloGovernment Station.570. This claim is illustrated in the plan opposite page 5 the evidence. While we think that the above solution is equita we are informed that the. Meru set considerable store on acquisition of the land now comprised in the farm (L.O. 4631) rather that part of it which is situated between the two rive and it is stated that they would be prepared to make an offer it.  In the special circumstances of the case, we see no reason w such oiler should not be considered if the lessee is prepared entertain it, and if accredited representatives of the Europ Highlands agree.  But the farm forms an integral part of a hi which was surveyed in 1913 to be alienated to Europeans, and find no reason for excluding it from the area which we si define as &quot;Highlands&quot; under the sixth term of reference.571. Isiolo, the administrative headquarters of the North Frontier Province, is actually situated in the Meru Native Beser The District Commissioner remarks : &quot;The Meru Local Council get the rents for trading p in Isiolo and have no particular objection to Governm occupying the land. Ever since the start of Isiolo boma, ho ever, there has been a tendency for Somalis to accuimil and reside there with their stock. What is most serioi there has sprung up a large settlement of alien Somalis acr the township boundary and within the Meru District. 1 stock of these and other Somalis, being within the Isi Township area, consequently encroach upon the grazing this district and the Meru are naturally very indignant ab this matter, which is bound to lead to serious trouble soo or later.&quot;572. We entirely agree with the District Commissioner, a are of opinion that these Somalis should be moved from the a in which they now reside. We make recommendations for tl disposal in section 815 below.573. We are satisfied, on evidence given to us by Adminisi Forest Reserve fove officers as well as by the Meru themselves, that, when Native Forest Deserve was demarcated, extensive areas of pastu land were included within the forest boundary.  The natives allowed to use the grazing on obtaining a permit from the For Department, but this is not the same thing as free use of t land, and they claim that these grasslands ought not to have included in the forest at all.  We are inclined to sympathize w the Meru in the matter and recommend that the question of forest boundary be reconsidered.   The District Commissioner the Conservator of Forests believe that a new forest bound satisfactory to all parties could be found which would have effect of excluding substantial  areas of pastureland from Forest Reserve.Meru Native
KIKUYU PROVINCEIt I-Chapter XVI]Embu and Meru Districts574. An area of some 131 acres in the Meru Native Eeserve for several years past been in the occupation of the King&apos;s lican Rifles. At first it was used to accommodate a detachment lone company, but it has now become the headquarters of the Battalion and of the Northern Frontier Province Military [chanical Supply and Transport Corps.   It appears that the lu have never consented to this occupation and are averse it.   They represent : (1) That the area occupied by the King&apos;s African Rifles is situated in the most thickly populated part of the district and is of considerable agricultural and residential value.(2) That the people oE the location concerned have already given land for the United Methodist Church Mission and for the Government station and can ill-afford to lose any more.(3) That the presence of large numbers of unmarried troops leads to the spread of prostitution and venereal disease amongst the Meru.575. The. District Commissioner adds that the brewing and at;- of native intoxicating liquors has proved most difficult to trol in the vicinity of the military camp. These reasons jsess a certain validity, but would, by themselves, constitute a -sided presentment of the case. It is beyond question that one he chief economic needs of the Meru is a local market for their TJuce, and the presence of so large a body of the Eing&apos;s African es should be of great monetary advantage to them in this pect. The Meru are also able to earn wages as porters for the ply and Transport Corps.576. Whether the King&apos;s African Rifles remain in Aleru trict or go elsewhere is a matter which must be settled by itary considerations, with which we are not concerned. Our onimendation is that, for so long a time as they remain, they lit to pay rent.  The plot should be set apart and leased.The genearal procedure governing such leases is a matter with jieh we deal in the third part of our Report (sections 1525-1541).577. The Embu natives claim that the present boundary of Forest Eeserve was demarcated without reference to the rights meeting under the system of land tenure of the tribes concerned ge Embu, Chuka, Muthambi and Mwimbi) and also in disregard tribal requirements in the use of salt-licks.578. The District Commissioner makes the following aments : &quot;It has frequently been stated by responsible persons that, at the time the boundary line was cleared, local natives were informed that the clearing was intended as a road toThe Question of the Removal of the King&apos;s African Rifles from Meru.Embu Claim to Part of Mount Kenya Forest.

He adds that forest cultivation amongst the natives! his district is considerably less destructive than amongst j Kikuyu, inasmuch as large trees are not cut or destroyed by fil being regarded as the property of the tribe and consequently Jj to be touched by individual landowners.580. We have no evidence that there was any eonsiderall native cultivation above the forest line or that the Embn ma I use of the land to any extent, and we do not recommend al alteration in the boundary as it would be certain to lead to 11 destruction of some of the best forest in the Colony.581. The natives appeared to be more concerned with tl question of use of the salt-licks than that of the land, and S recommend that arrangements be made with the Conservator!

385CHAPTER XVII.jjllTAIN LAND PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE NAffiOBI TOWNSHIP AND COMMONAGE.582. Before proceeding to discuss in detail the adequacy or The necessityrwise of the accommodation for natives in Nairobi, it will be ^reasPf0rrate1 to offer some observations on the general questions whether Natives, existence of special quarters, where only natives may reside where natives must reside, is necessary or advisable.5S3. Having regard to the widely different standards of livingIcrved by natives in Nairobi as compared with other races, we convinced that considerations of health as well as of social cnities demand separate areas. We are, therefore, satisfied that jcial residential areas for natives are needed in which they Jiild be required to reside unless exempted.   Native domestic vants are generally exempted and reside on the premises of their ministers, and a native who owns a shop in the business area iuId naturally be allowed to live in it, provided that the building forms with the requirements necessary to qualify it to be used residential purposes.   There are other cases where exemption ght be necessary for instance, the case of night workers, who e to live near their work.584. It is something of a moot point whether special exemp-fln should be granted to more advanced natives on the grounds at their higher standard of life qualifies them to live in any(idential part of Nairobi which they may prefer or can afford, e argument in support of this view is that the native quarter likely to be a poor quarter and the lay-out plan made by the iuiicipality is likely to be conceived accordingly, so that it might ifficult for a more well-to-do native to obtain a plot suitable his requirements. But there is no reason why the native quarter wild be conceived as being one and indivisible, and when occa-in arises it should be possible to set aside a special area or burb as a residential quarter for the more advanced natives. In dition to this we consider that it should be possible to grant eruptions to suitable native applicants enabling them to reside side the native area, if good grounds exist why they should be lowed to do so. We understand from the Municipal Authorities [at this is already possible.585. The present situation in Nairobi is that there are :      The Present(1) A native location at Pangani, which is to a large extent a spontaneous growth.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Common(2) A planned location at Pumwani, for the plannincl which the Municipality&apos; is responsible.(3) A Municipal Housing Scheme, in which the ifj cipality builds and owns the houses and lets rooms to nativi(4) A Government Housing Scheme and other provisio made by Government and by the Railway for the housing then African employees.(5) A reserve at Ivibira for Sudanese ex-soldiers of I King&apos;s African Rifles.(1) Pangani. 586. When the railway had reached Nairobi and a town be:to spring up, natives gradually gravitated to this centre a several collections of native huts appeared. As time went on \ smaller settlements were removed and Pangani became ( recognized native quarter. It now occupies some thirty acres (t total reservation being 45 acres of which 15 acres are taken the road reserve).587. While there is no record that it was ever set as: expressly for this purpose, it has in fact been used as a nat quarter ever since. The site has not proved to be particula suitable and the haphazard way in which the native houses k been built, with very little regard for alignment and still ! for sanitation, had already determined Government by 1922 close the village and move the inhabitants to Pumwani. Vark obstacles connected with compensation arose to prevent the pro; being carried into effect. In December, 1922, the District Co missioner, Nairobi, made comprehensive proposals both for co ppensation of plot holders and for enabling them, by means o: loan, to build houses in Pumwani.588. The major details of the scheme are : (a) That compensation on houses should be paid ad valonthe estimated average rate per house being  5, and; total number of houses being 312, making a total e; mated outlay of ^1,560.(b) That the amount involved in this compensation, , 1,5:or thereabouts, be advanced from the municipal nat brewery fund, and be repaid by Government from ; proceeds of the sale of the land to be evacuated Pangani.(c) That any balance from the sale of land at Pangani a!repayment of the amount owing to the municipal nat: brewery fund be credited to a municipal native trust. ., (d) That every householder, besides being compensated-   &apos; the manner aforesaid for the loss of his house, slwreceive a loan of an amount sufficient, when added the amount of compensation paid to him, to make
386KENYA LAND COMMISSION REPORT167KIKTJYU PROVINCEart I Chapter XVII]Nairobi Township and Commonagethe sum of ;t&apos;35, to be employed by him in building a house at Pumwani on a plot to be assigned by the Municipality.(Note. The sum was calculated to be sufficient to enable him to build a four-roomed house of wattle and daub on a suitable plinth, and with a corrugated iron roof.)(c) That the loan made to the householder be made from the municipal native brewery fund and bear interest at 4 per cent; that redemption be spread over five years; and that the stand permit fee of Sh. 5 be not charged during this period.(0 That any householder who has more than one house should be compensated in respect of all of them, but should only receive assistance by loan for the building of one. I    (g) That any householder who does not wish to build at Pumwani should be at liberty to take his compensation in cash and leave the town. 589. We observe from a perusal of the Government files that lie matter has been held over until our Commission has reported, id therefore it appears that recommendations in some detail are squired of us.  The proposals of the District Commissioner, being ipressed in detail, are a suitable starting point for criticism, [though it is clear from the files that they do not necessarily (present the views of Government, which still has the project rider consideration.   We have visited Pangani and Pumwani in Dmpany with the Municipal Affairs Officer, the Town Clerk and he Medical Officer of Health, and have taken their evidence and hat of other officers, as well as the evidence of the natives con-concerned.  We have also had access to the Secretariat files on the abject and have heard the views of the Commissioner of Lands. Bur conclusion is as follows : 590. The location at Pangani appears to us to be deleterious oth to the health and morals of the natives. It is badly over-rowded and has a notable preponderance of undesirables. The unitary conditions are not such as ought to be permitted in iairobi and are a menace to the town. No substantial ameliorative-ion could be effected without a condemnation of a large propor-on of the houses, a course which would inflict more hardship than he general move which is proposed.591. We regard the District Commissioners proposals as suit-ble in some ways, but note the following points : (1) We are surprised that the valuation of a house at Pangani buld have been set so low as  5, especially as it is estimated that i would cost as much as  35 to build a four-roomed house of
vyattle and daub at Pumwani. These figures appear to need re consideration. In this connexion the evidence given to us by th Superintendent of the Location is interesting. He stated : &quot;You can build a mud and wattle hut with second-han corrugated iron for Sh. 300 to Sh. 400, but not with a concret floor, but I should not pass that.   To put up a house that should allow would cost Sh. SOO to Sh. 1,000.&quot;If these figures are accepted it would seem that the estimate o  5 as suitable compensation for the houses at Pangani is far toi low, and that the estimate of  35 as the cost of building a housi at Pumwani is also too low. Probably  15 as an average assess ment for a house, at Pangani would be nearer the mark, but separate valuation would have to be made in each case.(2) In the second place we note that nothing has been allowe by way of compensation for disturbance and loss of amenities points which ought to be taken into account. In the case of lodg ing house keepers the loss by disturbance will be very considerable unless they are allowed to keep lodgings in their new quarters We think, however, that a distinction should be drawn betwee legitimate lodging houses and those which are used for irregula purposes. In the former case loss of business through disturbane should be taken into account in assessing compensation : in th latter case it should not.(3) In respect of the land itself there is clearly nothing flue because it is Crown land for which the plot-holders pay rent. ay therefcie notice with some surprise the proposal contained i (c) above, which is in effect that, if the amount paid in compensa tion to natives for their houses is less than the proceeds of th sale of the land, the balance should be paid to a municipal native trust. We do not appreciate the reason for this, but think that i the very unlikely contingency of any profit being realized on tht transaction Government is entitled to it.(4) We do not conceive that Government is under any obliga tion to grant a loan for the purpose of settling all the dispossessei natives in Pumwani, but there is an obligation to find accoiumoda tion for, them somewhere either in their own reserves or else where. Nor should we wish to deny the claims of some of tin long-established residents to very S3;mpathetic consideration, see ing that they were porters and servants of Government in tht early days. We recommend the granting of such a loan as i proposed to approved applicants, but there is need for discriniina tion. It would be clearly unwise to assist undesirables to establisl themselves in Pumwani.KIKVUYU PROVINCE I*aiit I Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Commons
KIKUYU PROVINCEI Chapter XVII]Nairobi Township and Commonage(5) We notice that there has been some debate whether atives who move from Pangani into Pumwani should be allowed keep lodging houses. We consider that if they are reputable tsoiis and keep respectable lodgings in Pangani, they should be lowed to keep them in Pumwani or alternatively that the com-msation given to them should be the greater because of the loss business which the disturbance will cause.(0) The closing of Pangani will cause disturbance to lodgers, ecially to the undesirables. In most cases they have reserves to ich they could be required to go, but for some of them accom-odation in the reserves would be difficult.   On  this problem, ich is not confined to Pangani, we shall make comprehensive commendations below (sections 623, 624 and 1870-1878).(7) We are inclined to think that the closing of Pangani will t prove to be so cheap or so simple a matter as the District mmissioner&apos;s memorandum implies, and if the whole village is o\ed at one time it seems likely that considerable hardship may suit. By far the greater number of the inhabitants are lodgers ose accommodation elsewhere will be a matter of great iculty, whether they leave the town or remain. We, therefore, commend that the closing of the village be accomplished by actions.592. Pumwani Native Location was declared open in January, 22, and now contains 317 houses all built by the natives them-lves, with the exception of ten owned by the Municipality. The tives have plots assigned to them on which to build, and a and permit fee of Sh. 5 is charged. They are allowed to open troops subject to the possession of a trading licence and the emises being passed as suitable, and the number of such shops present exceeds fifty. They are not allowed to keep licensed dging houses, but apparently they are allowed to sub-let rooms, maternity home, a clinic, public workhouses, a memorial hall d a sports ground, and various ether social services and ameni-es have been provided, including the municipal native brewery, om which most of the funds are found.593. It is the intention of Government that this area, in njimction with the land occupied by the municipal housing heme and Government housing scheme for African employees, ould become the principal native quarter of Nairobi. The three reas are all situated at Pumwani and are sufficiently near to-ether to be regaided as one native quarter, although there is tervening land which has been alienated for other purposes. The resent area of the native location is 130 acres, of the municipal ousing scheme 41 acres and of the Government housing scheme 5 acres.   Two additional areas totalling 194 acres have been(2) PumwaniNativeLocation.

YVe regard the area, togethe with the extensions, as being sufficient for present and near futur requirements, saving the suggestion which we have already mad as to the, desirability of a special residential quarter for ruor well-to-do natives.594. We note that in the plan prepared by the Nairobi Tow Planning Authority before it handed over to the Municipality j w;is contemplated that Pumwani would eventually be extende southwards over the Veterinary Quarantine area as far as th Ngong river or even beyond it, and we understand that this in tention still stands. We consider the provisional reservation o this area for future extension to be a prudent step.595. The municipal housing scheme consists of a number o blocks of buildings containing sitting rooms, dormitories an cubicles, while kitchens are provided in which natives may coo their own food. A monthly charge of Sir. 4 is made for a bed while Sir. 7 is charged for a cubicle containing tlnee beds. A present only about a third of the beds are occupied a state o affairs said to be due to the present depression.590. We are advised that the principal use made of tbi scheme is by the larger firms employing native labour in Nairobi who find it convenient to hire blocks of rooms for their Africa! employees.597. A separate scheme exists for the accommodation of th African employees of Government, which at present is confine to providing houses for interpreters and office boys. It is entirel managed and financed by Government, and the total area of th plot set aside for this purpose is 33 acres. This is not, of course the whole of the arrangements made by Government for th housing of its employees, and there are many other areas to whic no detailed allusion is required for instance, the military lines the police lines, the warders&apos; lines and the Railway landis.598. The area generally known as Kibira is L.O. 1702, whic was surveyed in 1917 as a military reserve and was gazetted a such in 1918. It comprises 4197-9 acres, and is situated south o the Ngong Eoad, partly inside and partly outside the Nairob municipal area.599. It appears that this area was originally assigned to th King&apos;s African Rifles in 1904, although not gazetted until man years later. There is nothing in the gazettement to show for win reason so large an area was required, but it is common knowledjr
KIKUYU PROVINCE I_Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Commonageiat one of the objects was to provide a home for Sudanese ex-jkaris. It cannot be said that these facilities were provided for the udanese in lieu of pension, since they received a gratuity on retire-icnt. But no doubt it was felt that there was a moral obligation ither to repatriate them or to find them homes in the country, and was also hoped that the institution of a military cantonment of is kind would form a useful recruiting ground when the sons of ese ex-askaris should grow up.  Presumably it was thought that e settlement would increase, since their sons in turn would retire Bid beget families, and therefore so large a reservation was made.GOO. But it was certainly not intended that the whole area lould be devoted to the military cantonment. The King&apos;s African ifl.es&apos; lines themselves are inside it, and so are the golf links, and icre is nothing whatever to support the contention of the Sudanese lat the whole area was given to them as a reserve for ever. They ere merely given permission to live there.601. The legal position of the occupants of Kibira appears to 3 that they are tenants at will of the Crown, and the tenancy is [able to termination by the Commissioner of Lands at any time, n the other hand we cannot agree that they have no rights in buity. We consider that Government had a clear duty to these askaris either to repatriate them or to find accommodation for hem. They were told that they might make their homes at Kibira nd in our judgment they ought not to be moved without receiving jitable land elsewhere and compensation for disturbance, and c consider that a similar obligation exists in respect of their idows, or sons who are already householders at Kibira.602. But figures given to us indicate that out of 571 houses nly 251 belong to Sudanese ex-askaris or their dependants. The mainder are said to belong to a heterogeneous miscellany of persons who have penetrated into the settlement from time to me. More than half of these householders are said to be women, [&apos; whom the majority are of undesirable character. We would ofc deny even to these later comers some claim in equity to receive compensation if Kibira is closed, but they are certainly on a ifferent footing from the Sudanese.603. While we are fully satisfied of the necessity for moving he unauthorized residents of Kibira, we are not convinced of the ecessity for moving the Sudanese. Their past services to Gov-rnment entitle them to sympathetic consideration, and it is abstain that they would prefer to stay where they are. We shall presently show grounds for thinking that it would be to the dvanlage both of themselves and of Government that they should allowed to do so.  But first, since Government clearly has the
right to move them, if it wishes, upon payment of compensation and has expressed the intention of doing so, we shall state th terms upon which we consider that it could fairly be done.(1) There should be payable in respect of every Sudan.cs-household (i.e., the household of a Sudanese ex-askari or of hi widow or of his son or sons) : (a) Compensation in full for the house.(6) Compensation in the form of equal facilities for cultiva tion and grazing to be granted in another settletnen within easy reach of Nairobi. Provided that the grazin necessary should be computed at four acres in respec of each grown head of cattle owned by the househol up to the maximum of twenty-four acres per household (c) Compensation for any crops damaged or destroyed am compensation for disturbance estimated at 15 per cen of the value of (ft). Note 1. The limitation to 24 acres (i.e., provision for si head of cattle) appears to us to be justified, because tho purpose for which the settlement was made shows that it was clearly no intended that single households should use it as a ranching pre position, although they would be entitled to keep stock sufficien for their reasonable requirements.Note 2. The site should preferably be near enough to Nairoi to allow the population, which has urban proclivities, to have eas; access, and far enough away to be safe from early disturbance c account of the expansion of the town.Note 3. Since the facilities which the Sudanese enjoy in li; present settlement were not given to them and their heirs ii perpetuity, but were more in the nature of provision granted k their lifetime, we consider that the new settlement should be o similar terms. We recommend that it should be rent free in ft case of each household during the lifetime of the present house holders or their widows, but after that a rent should be charged.Note 4. If any Sudanese does not wish to go to the nev settlement, but prefers to go to Pumwani or elsewhere, he shod be allowed to take compensation in cash, to be assessed accordir. to the value of the above facilities.(2) There should be payable to all householders, other tha the Sudanese, the bare cost of their houses and standing crop and they should be required to take up plots in Pumwani return to their own reserves. Those of uncertain origin should sent to the reserves with which they appear to have most aflinii -or, if they can afford to do so, should take up plots in Pumwan or lease land in &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; areas.KIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Comm.o
KIKUYU PROVINCE M ^_Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and CommonagejVotc._B may well be argued that these persons have built oni-own land without authority, and deserve no compensation. But omo of them have been there for many years and Government has flowed them to remain.   Others have followed, observing that overnrnent took no action. The natives, as being a people under itelape, are entitled to expect that Government will direct and ntrol.  Where Government relaxes that control it must, in our inion, share the responsibility if irregularities occur, and natives (fnnot be greatly blamed if they take Governments inaction as  presenting acquiescence.G04. One of the reasons for wishing to abolish the native General Com-ettlement at Kibira is the desire to be rid of a somewhat dis- p^St^? at&quot; rderly location, and to effect a distribution so that those natives Kibira. fho can justify their presence in the town should go to Pumwani; ndesirables should return to their reserves; and the residue of udanese should be moved into a garden suburb or village settle-nent within reach of Nairobi, where they might cultivate in K-urity. The other reason, which has probably had equal weight, to set free an area for town-planning for residential purposes. ,&apos;liile we think that the disposal suggested for the native element i be eminently desirable, we are not convinced that the Sudanese ill be as well suited by a settlement at a distance from the town ; they are by their present location.60-5. The urgent part of the problem is to deal with the natives ho have entered the location without authority and are, for the lost part, leading disorderly lives.   That is urgently required in ic interest of general discipline.  But in respect of the proposal ) move the Sudanese there is perhaps less need for haste.  While o have recommended that all existing Sudanese householders have right to be compensated, wre do not think that there is any Migation to allow any further houses to be built. As a recruiting ound for the King&apos;s African Rifles the settlement has been practically useless, and we consider that all reasonable obligation s discharged to the Sudanese if the existing houses are allowed to ontinue.   They should not be transferable, but should be des-royed on the death of the householder or his widow or widows. HTlie sons should move into Pumwani or leave the town, and it is recommended that a small ex gratia payment be made to enable hem to do so.606. As numbers decrease and the area of the reservation is estricted accordingly, it may become desirable to confine it to a antonment in one corner of the present area. If for that purpose becomes necessary to move any house, it could be done on pay-:ient of the actual cost cf demolition and rebuilding, and such case lould naturally form an exception to the provision that no house should be built.
KIKUYU PROVINCE Paet I Chapteh XVII] Nairobi Township and CohiioxaoINative Garden Suburbs or Village Settlements.G07. Our reason for suggesting- that the Sudanese shoul remain at Kibira for the present is not only because they are like! to decrease in numbers and could probably be moved at le; expense later on. Nor is it solely because they would prefer to left alone as long as possible. A further and perhaps a bettel reason is that we have grave doubts of the success of native garde: suburbs or village settlements at a distance from Nairobi an consider that the experiment, if made at all, should be made comprehensive lines after a full study of the issues involved, an: such a scheme should certainly not come into being simply as ai expedient lor moving a few Sudanese from a somewhat valua! residential site.60S. Having regard to the purposes for which the land vi originally7 set aside we consider that it is justifiable to limit tj rule the number of live stock which any householder may kei there. A grazing area could then be delimited in accordance wit these requirements, and provision should also be made for tl den&apos;areaticn of arable lands. In this way a more orderly arrant&apos; merit could be secured.609. Before making our recommendation on the question i native garden suburbs, it will be well to set out some extracts froj the evidence which we have recorded on the subject : &quot;I think you have got to have two schemes your location in your town and your extramural village withtj reach of that town. Your town location should really ck] with people who have to live or can afford to live in the tow If you have got to deal with the residue of detribalized native who simply have been deruralized rather than detribalized vo may be forced to make some provision for them within reat of a town . . .&quot;&quot;The extramural village ought to be far enough a mil from the town not to interfere with the municipal lodgii houses, but near enough to allow natives to enjoy certain amenities of a town. The workers mainly should be accoi accommodated in the location. It is the people who have a Hit bit of produce to sell and who want to enjoy urban amenities such as football matches and pictures, who might live in ;&apos;. extramural village.&quot;&quot;No village would be a success unless it was a volur one.  There are a large number of safari boys who work f:l high wages for possibly three months of the year; they liavj got to be in reach of a safari, but there is no reason why-should spend the remaining nine months in the town tlx] could live perfectly well 10 to 15 miles out . . .&quot;
KENYA LAND COMMISSION REPORT175     390KIKUYU PROVINCE I T j-_chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Commonage&quot;I would lay the village out and have allotments with a[common fence round outside.&quot; (See Evidence, pp. 1150-1155.) 610. An examination of the above evidence does not hold out uch hope of the success of the settlement as an enterprise in larket gardening. In the first paragraph the position is taken iat Government may be forced to open the settlement in order ) provide for deruralized natives, unlikely recruits for work of iis kind. The second paragraph shows that the inhabitants would it be workers in the town, but require to be near it because of eir predilection for pictures and football matches. The third iragraph shows another use for the village as a place where fari porters could live during the nine months of the year while money are unemployed. Apparently the conception which the itiiess has of the settlement is not so much that it promises much iccess in an agricultural sense, as that it will accommodate itives who have become too &quot;deruralized&quot; to support life with minimity in their reserves. On the other hand Colonel llkinson, the Officer Commanding the King&apos;s African Eifles, ates that the typical askari, after completing his tour of service takes up his native life without the least trouble&quot; (Evidence, ,1157).611. We now turn to the evidence of Mr. C. IT. Adams, istrict Commissioner, Nairobi.&quot;Land round big towns is much too valuable to start native farms adjoining them. The demand for small articles of produce, vegetables, potatoes, etc., is more than met by existing supplies and could be vastly increased if sufficient demand arose . . . Natives who want to cultivate or keep slock should remain in their reserves. They cannot claim from Government land elsewhere in the most valuable places merely because they do not like their reserves. Most de-tribalized natives in town do not want to cultivate . . . The natives of this country with the exception of Nubians and Swahilis and a few others have good reserves, and there should always be a home under natural and reasonable conditions for them there.&quot;   (Evidence, pp. 1145-1149.)612. The evidence of Mr. H. A. Carr, the present Municipal flairs Officer, is similar in effect. In answer to a question whether here is any demand for native quarters on garden city lines, he tated : &quot;That is a question that has been discussed for a long time, and many people seem to take it for granted that it is a necessity.  Personally I do not think it is at all quite the
contrary. It seems to me that if you start allowing th suburbs to spring up you will get the same bad conditions them as you have in Pangani.&quot;613. The evidence of Dr. A. R. Paterson, Acting Director Medical and Sanitary Services, appears to be generally favour;-, to native&apos; garden suburbs near towns, but does not go into detj Attempts have been made to find a suitable area for such a venti somewhere on the Nairobi.commonage. A soil survey has b, prepared by the Department of Agriculture and is printed wi the evidence (p. 1131) and states comprehensively that &quot;the ai under survey is decidedly of a second choice when in search land for arable cultivation.&quot; In the analysis of particular area; shows that there are extensive areas which might be expected repay-deep and skilful cultivation, but, even so, the crops would liable to suffer severely in time of drought.Concision on 614. After  considering this evidence  we have formed :opinion that the establishment of a village garden settlement o side Nairobi is fraught with many difficulties and, unless eonceii on broader lines than the present proposal, is foredoomed to fi ure. The most obvious difficulty with which it is faced is t1 the land available would only repay cultivation by skilful meth and deep digging, and the population which it is proposed to set there has been described as not so much detribalized as deruraliz-In fact, they are about the last people from whom skilful at culture and deep digging are to be expected.615. On the other hand it may be contended there are peril; elderly married natives who have retired from a useful life wage-earning in the town, and have now perhaps a son at wi in it and wish to live near him. While they are simply i mouths and solely dependent on their sons&apos; earnings if ft remain in the town, they might contrive to grow a few vegetal) or keep a few chickens if they have an allotment in a gan: settlement, and might at the same time provide a more comfoi able home for their son, who could go daily to his work on bicycle. There may, in fact, be such persons, and it is possit that for a few years the settlement might prove useful in t respect in the same way as garden suburbs are useful adjuncts towns in European countries.616. But there is one point of paramount importance whi vitiates any attempt to draw a parallel. In a European count a family might find an agricultural allotment in a suburb a co venient means of supplementing wages earned in the town, b when its members cease to have employment in the town it wotKIKUYU PROVINCE Part I Chapter XVII] Nairobi Township and Co:

Its place would be taken by another family of no earners.C617. But.among Kenya natives at this stage there is uo such ility of redistribution. The most genuinely detribalized natives, whom in particular it is necessary to provide, are the very sons who-would find most difficulty in moving elsewhere, and s probable that in a very few years one would find a village ubited by pauper natives who have ceased to have any eon-ion with the town and are seeking to. support themselves variously on second-rate soil in a village of garden allotments Lieut any countryside. . One cannot be callous enough to recom-nd the institution of a garden suburb simply for the sake of riding a convenient oubliette for pauper natives and so reliev-the towu of the responsibility of dealing with them. We agree principle with the opinion expressed by the District Cominis-ler, that the native reserves are the proper place for natives ose presence in the towu is no longer required.618. But while this is our general view, there are exceptional es. There are some natives who have become ,so detribaiized or o have so little affinity; with any tribe for which a reserve has in set aside that they could not fairly be required to live in any ticular native reserve. There are others perhaps who have a itimate desire to take up land on lease and develop it as a fate farm on more individual lines than would at present, be impossible in a reserve. Such persons should be allowed to take up id in &quot;C&quot; areas.619. Such a solution may be thought to be open to the same objections as the village settlement scheme, but the broader basis i which it is conceived gives it more chance of success. Instead a few&apos; score of more or less uniform small holdings surrounding-village, it is a planned lay-out of a countryside to be divided into mis of different sizes, some held individually and some on a eeies of group or family tenure, the whole idea being to suit e different requirements of persons in different degrees of dlizaticn and to avoid excessive uniformity. A village scheme of lall holdings,,unless combined with some larger farms or enter-ises or supported by an elaborate machinery of co-operation, is &apos;t to produce a dead level of pioverty and an excessive uniformity cultivation, so that when the main.crop fails all suffer alike and ere are no richer or larger farms which might afford temporary pport. But a scheme devised on broader lines would allow for e existence of some larger farms and, so far as possible, preserve i element of tribal control in the larger groups. Urban natives om the&apos;towns would only be a cmall element in the. population,

A soil survey of t near Nairobi   Nairobi Commonage shows that area to be not very suitable agricultural settlements except in patches, but there is land the neighbourhood of the Kiserian and Mbagathi rivers in i Masai Reserve which would be suitable for mixed farming if i Alasai are prepared to lease it, and in a later passage, when are dealing with the Alasai Province, we make a proposal to t effect that approximately -sixty-nine square miles of this land the position marked E on the map following section 69S shon if possible, be leased from the Masai for 99 years and be develop analogously to a &quot;C&quot; area (see sections 706 and 709 (3) below).This land is only used nowadays by the Alasai of the Ai Plains during times of severe drought and then only for ve brief periods. It is well-watered and considerable areas in I valleys could be cultivated. It adjoins the Nairobi common; and the point at the river junction is about seven miles from t! centre of the town. It stretches in a general direction south-Wt by west to the slopes of the Ngong Hills, and at its westei extremity it is about six miles from the nearest point of C Kikuyu Native Reserve. It is, therefore, most convenien; situated to be used as a &quot;C&quot; area. It is near enough to Nairc to admit of native immigrants from the locations keeping a footii there until they have established themselves, and near enough the Kikuyu Reserve to admit of Kikuyu natives taking up lai there without severing their home connexions. Eventually, : doubt, these two classes of immigrants would form a commnnr and intermarry, and the area would help to bridge the gap betwet the town and the neighbouring reserves and produce a great fluidity of distribution. Eor, while it would be unreasonable expect the Kikuyu or Alasai or any other native reserve to recei alien natives from Nairobi, such as Sudanese and foreign native-and persons of mixed or uncertain origin, the &quot;C&quot; area will te: to fuse the various elements and it will probably not be diffici for a native born in such an area to obtain a footinEj&apos;, at least a tenant, in either of the neighbouring native reserves, should! desire to do so.621. Not everybody would welcome such a solution, at penetration of this kind will certainly add to the difficulties-administering the reserves.   But, the matter being viewed pare.
KIKUYU PROVINCE I_CHArxKK NYU] Nairobi Township and Commonagei a land problem, it cannot be denied that the rigidity of native serve boundaries and the absence of anything resembling a free market in land renders problems of distribution very difficult. It uiuot permanently be for the good of the country that we should ve problems of local congestion in Kikuyu, problems of under-bpulation in Masai, and problems of unemployed, landless, stribalized natives in Nairobi all of them due to a lack of idity in the means of distribution.(i-2-&apos;  The sum of our conclusions regarding urban natives in Summary cf c n Conclusionsa ii obi is as follows :  regarding(a) We recommend that Pangani should be moved by sections ?r*Sn5 N*tivc*&quot; on the terms which we have suggested, and that ap- in &quot; air 1-proved applicants be admitted into Pumwani.(b) We consider that Pumwani should be developed as the main native quarter of Nairobi. The size of the reserva-tion after taking into account the two extensions im-mediately proposed, is sufficient for present and near future requirements, while we note that further exton-sions could be effected by taking in parts of the Yeterin-ary Quarantine area, as occasion may arise.(c) We recommend thai an area be set aside as a residential quarter for more well-to-do natives, but that, in special cases, it should be possible to grant permits to approved native applicants enabling them to live in other residen-tial areas of the town.(d) We have made recommendations regarding the com-pensaticn which we should consider equitable if it is desired to move the Sudanese settlement at Kibira. But if Government does not consider the move to be an urgent necessity, we recommend that only the un-authorized native immigrants be moved at once, com-pensation being paid as recommended, but that the Sudanese be allowed to remain on the conditions wdiich we have proposed.(e) If the Sudanese are moved, we consider it preferable that they should either move into Pumwani or into a &quot;0&quot; area. If it is found possible to establish a &quot;C&quot; area in the locality which we have recommended between the Kiserian and Mbagathi Bivers by leasing it from the Masai, they might perhaps be given accommodation there, but we record our opinion that a garden allot-mert suburb conceived in isolation would be foredoomed to failure.(f) We agree that the general method of dealing with natives who are not wanted in Nairobi and have no means of

It is perhaps outside the scope of our duties to mat] recommendations as to the conditions under which it should lawful to require a native to leave Nairobi.

This applies to the returned squatter from I farm as well as to natives from towns, and it is important tkl District Commissioners should have the necessary powers, mq difficulties in this connexion have already arisen.624. In respect of natives of uncertain origin, who may ordered to leave Nairobi as &quot;vagrants&quot; and protest that they italy  nowhere to go. we consider that the District commissioner Nairobi, or such other authority as may- be appointed, should ha: the power to determine, after due inquiry, the tribe and reset&quot; to which such native property belongs or with which he has mo affinity, and that there should be a powrer to send him to sn: reserve, and that the District Commissioner of such reserve shrra be bound to receive him and. find accommodation for him.Nairobi 625.. It will be convenient to allude in this p! ace to the pro!lent created by Somali cattle on Nairobi commonage, althongl Somalis &quot;not being natives of the Colony, it is perhaps not stririj part of the subject matter of this chapter.- 626. It appears that about thirty years ago Somali tradJ were given permission to depasture their cattle on Nairobi coil mortage. &quot;These original Somalis and others who have come la have accumulated more than two thousand head of cattle and now7 using the commonage as a ranch.&apos; i   627. The first effort to pilace their tenancy7 on a regular footiil seems to have been made in 1929, when they were ordered to jtj two shillings a year for a temporary occupation licence on common and twenty-four shillings a year as rent for a boma p! An area of thirty acres was surveyed, evidently with the intentij that these Somali bomas or small village settlements should&apos;

The temporary occupation licences have been dropped, ait the rents continue to be collected, and there are now&apos; twenty-three homes which pay.029. The Somalis do not seem to have entered any protest at he time against the payment of rent, but in 1931 a proposal was aade that they should be required to pay a grazing fee of 50 ents for each head of cattle and ten cents for each sheep or goat, nd at this point they entered a protest. On 1st March, 1932, hey addressed a petition through His Excellency the&apos; Governor o the Secretary of State in which it is stated that : &quot;towards the :lose of Queen \rietoria&apos;s reign they, at the suggestion of the !rovircial Commissioner, left various scattered grazing areas rhich they occupied in and around Nairobi, and collected at this ipot, being informed that it had been given to them as a gift from lie Queen.&quot;G30. The files to which we have had access reveal nothing to iiipport the contention that there was a gift of any kind. The jomalis have been called in evidence and cannot substantiate it. We are satisfied that in this case, as in so many others which lave been brought before us, all that really happened is that lermission was granted to occupy a certain area during the ileasure of Government.G31. The files do not reveal for what purpose the Nairobi uominonage was originally instituted, but it is reasonable to sup-pose that it was to provide grazing for trade cattle in transit, for transport oxen and for slaughter oxen. There is nothing to show that it was ever intended, and it is inherently unlikely that it was intended, to be used as a communal farm where either Somalis or any other .residents of the township might rear cattle. The Nairobi Commonage is 43 square miles in extent, which is far; more than can possibly be required for services proper to the township. Our first recommendation, therefore, is that an area be marked off sufficient to provide accommodation for such of the Somalis who are residing there now as were in the Uganda Eifl.es (subject to similar restrictions to those which we have recom-tnended for the Sudanese asharis at Kibira) and to provide grazing lor slaughter oxen, transport oxen and trade cattle in transit, and be handed over to the Municipality to be administered as an integral part of the township, and be made subject to whatever Jontlitions the Municipality sees fit to enforce. The Somahs, in so far as they are cattle traders, can make use of it on the same terms as others in respect of any bona fide trade stock in transit.
KIKUYU PROVINCEPart I Chapter XVII]Nairobi Township and Comaioxj632. There then remains the consideration of what is happen to the rest of the area. Practically the whole of it j gazetted Game Reserve, and the Game Warden is anxious that] should be constituted a National Park, a proposal which appeal to have wide support. Although it is not a matter strictly withi our terms of reference, we wish to state that such a solutit appears to us to be in the best interests of the Colony, and y, record our very definite finding that no native rights would infringed.633. If, however, the area is not developed as a Nation! Park, and ceases to be Game Reserve, its status would be that! unalienated Crown land in the Highlands, in respect of whitj Europeans have a privileged position.   Facilities for stock-raisirT in it should not be granted to non-Europeans unless very shot grounds exist.  In the present case we cannot see that the Soma!: (apart from askaris of the Uganda Rifles) have any special claii such as would justify an exception being made.   We, therefor; recommend that Somali cattle should not be allowed to gra? there.  If a Somali wishes to continue trading in cattle he won! be free to move into Nairobi and keep his trade stock in transit o slaughter stock in the area specially reserved for that purpose, k he would have to give up ranching. If that course does not appe; to him he can take up land in a &quot;D&quot; area, where no speck privilege of race exists, or in a &quot;C&quot; area, since we shall recoit mend that the definition of the term &quot;native&quot; in respect of sue! areas be widened to include a Somali. Nubian or a Sudanese. Wl recommend, however, that the present permissive tenure he esl tended for one year wdiile arrangements are being made.634. WTe understand natives in Pumwani village also mas use of Nairobi commonage for grazing purposes. We conside that only very restricted facilities in this direction should k granted. Natives who live in towns cannot expect to keep cattle But if there is room for a few cows in milk to be kept on tl: part of the commonage to be taken over by the Municipalitj there is no reason why permits should not be granted on paymet of a small fee.

CHAPTER I.llllE MASAI PROVINCE :   SOME  OBSERVATIONS  ON THE   AGREEMENTS  OE  1904  AND  1911 AND THEIR EFFECTS.(535. It. is necessary to refer briefly to the early history of the Early History asai, and to the events which led to the decline of their power. of the Masa1-n account of the tribe has been given by several writers of whom He late Sir Charles Eliot was probably one of the best informed, e writes : &quot;From at least 1850 to the early eighties the Masai were a formidable power in East Africa. They successfully asserted themselves against the Arab slave-traders, took tribute from all who passed through their country, and treated other races, whether African or not, with the greatest arrogance.&quot;036. The Masai had a highly developed and well-organized Tribal ilitary system especially adapted for raiding purposes, and an  Organization. :count of some of the many raids they perpetrated will be found H Mr. Sandford&apos;s &quot;Administrative and Political History of the fosai Reserve.&quot;  It is noteworthy that these raids seldom extended Pi a westerly direction, where the Eumbwa and Nandi were prob-ibly at least a match for them and where even the less warlike Duo Jeem to have had little difficulty in holding them in check.637. The power of the Masai began seriously to decline through wane of the uious causes, of which the chief was a succession of internal wars. Masai Power, pertain divisions, notably the Uasin Gishu and Laikipiak, were lmost annihilated and scattered to the four winds by a combination if other groups, but the victories were of a Byrrhic character.638. About the year 1883, a serious epidemic, which was be- Cattle ieved by Joseph Thomson to have been rinderpest but was more Plagues.trobably pleuro-pneumonia, attacked their cattle and resulted in eavy losses.   This was followed a few years later, circa 1S89, by he great cattle plague known as rinderpest, and their vast herds -e to a large extent destroyed.639. A year or.two later internal warfare recommenced, owing Feud between o a feud between Lenana and Sendeyu, the two sons of the power- Lemma and ul Laibon, Mbatian.  At first Sendeyu was successful, and certain &apos;Sen elections  which   supported   Lenana,   notably   the  Kaputiei   and ilatapatu, were heavily defeated and were forced to seek refuge i the Kikuyu. Later the Purko, then, as now, the most powerfulJlivision of the Masai, threw in their weight on the side of Lenana, lefeated Sendeyu in a series of battles, and drove him and his followers in a south-westerly direction.

Sende and most of the Loita sought refuge across the German bor where they got into trouble with the German authorities a eventually returned to British territory. The remnants of the Si fled to the outskirts of the southern Luo country, where th remained for several years, eventually returning to the area th now occupy in the Trans-Mara region.640. Even after the above series of disasters the Masai we considered by many to be a formidable power, and Sir Char Eliot stated in the course of a report in June, 1901 : &quot;I regard the Masai as the most important and dangero of the tribes with whom we have to deal in East Africa, am1 think it will be long necessary to maintain an adequate militar force in the districts which they inhabit.&quot;In a later report, in April, 1903, he qualified this opinion a wrote : &quot;I agree with those who do not think the Masai are formidable element in East Africa.&quot;However great a force the Masai were at one time, it is certain th about 1895 their power had seriously waned, and although sporad raids against the less warlike tribes were not infrequent, the latt were holding their own and in some cases retaliating.  In fact are inclined to the opinion that, but for British protection, t Masai would have become a factor of comparatively minor important ance and their country might have gradually been occupied other tribes; the feud between Lenana and Sendeyu, after a bri reconciliation, was renewed and, but for Government interventio they would again have been at each others&apos; throats.   About 181i the numbers of Masai in British territory were little more tin 40,000, and with their internal dissensions they certainly could no have maintained their position against a concerted attack by othe tribes such as the Lmmbwa.641. With the advent of settled Government the Masai wet enabled to regain a little of their former power and were agai accumulating large flocks and herds. They wandered at will ove a large part of Kenya, and perpetrated several minor raids. Thi was the position in 1903, when European settlement had begin642. During 1903 applications were received from European for land in the Bift Valley and elsewhere in places where the Mas grazed their flocks and herds, and the question arose as to how fa such applications could be granted without encroaching on tli
KENYA LAND COMMISSION EEPOBT187MASAI PROVINCEit-Chapter 1]The Masai Agreements396i &quot;razing rights. Considerable discussion took place, and in member of&quot; that year Sir Charles Eliot wrote a memorandum in fch he stated :-&quot;In the discussion on this question two things seem to me [to have been confused: (1) The rights of the Masai to inhabit particular districts; (2) Their right to monopolize particular  districts,  and keep everybody else out. The first right is undoubted, but the second appears to me most questionable. As a matter of expediency it may some-times be best to make reserves, but, as a matter &quot;of principle, I cannot admit that wandering tribes have a right to keep other and superior races out of large tracts merely because rhey have acquired the habit of straggling over far more land than they can utilize.&quot;643. The kite Sir Donald Stewart, who succeeded Sir Charles  ^Agreement t as Governor, discussed the Masai question immediately after arrival and came to the conclusion that the removal of. the li from the Rift Valley into two reserves was the best solution, northern of the two proposed reserves was Laikipia, and the tern an area ot some 4,350 square miles south of the railway he position shown in the sketch map following Appendix No. 8.J644. The position was explained to the Masai chiefs and esentatives at a meeting held at Naivasha on the 9th August,t, and on the following day an agreement was signed by thelernor on the one part, and a number of Masai representing theKing clans and sections of the tribe on the other.645. The text of this agreement, known its the &quot;Masai Agree- .....It of 1904&quot;, will be found in Appendix No. 8.[646. The Alasai failed in important particulars to cany out The position part of the 1904 Agreement.  Sections named in the text of after 1904-Agreement  as the Elburgo, Gakunuki,  Loita, Damat and Jutolc did not  move  absolutely  to  Laikipia   (the  Northern reserve), but many of them, including the whole of the Loita and rat sections and a considerable number of the Elburgo (Eurico) J Gakunuki (Kakouyuke) remained in the south and scattered giighout what is now the Masai Reserve and far beyond the Tines of the  Southern Reserve  as it was then  constituted br the Agreement.    It is not known what section of the ai is meant by the &quot;Laitutok&quot; ; there are two divisions known ectively as the Loitokitok (a branch of the Sighirari) and the ayok, the former inhabiting an area to the north of Kilimanjaro the latter living with the Loita in the Loita hills.  Neither of sections moved to Laikipia.

There is no reliable estimate of the numbers of the il stock in 1904, but it is certain that they increased very largely in the north and south between that time and 1911. In 1907 late Mr. Collyer, then District Commissioner, Dumuruti, estirn: the number of cattle in the Northern Deserve at 70,000 and sheep and goats at 1,710,000.648. The Northern Deserve had been considerably extei beyond the boundaries as defined in the Agreement, and in south the Masai had spread all over the country from If Kilimanjaro to the Kisii and Kavirondo borders. A few farms been taken up along the southern G-uaso Nyiro Diver and Demek Valley.649. When it became clear on the one hand to Cover::;, that the Masai were not respecting their new boundaries, and Leu ana, the Paramount Chief, on the other hand, that the sei tion of the tribe into two areas had caused a greater disunity in tribal organization than he had anticipated and a weakening own authority, proposals for the concentration of the who! in an extended Southern Deserve began to be discussed. Whi full and complete statement of the objects and reasons of the posal would require mention of the fact that the Northern Desi was to be vacated partly for European settlement, it has also tc stated that the paramount chief of the tribe and the representa: chiefs and elders of the Northern Masai agreed to the move the reason set out in the preamble to the Agreement, namely they were &quot;satisfied that it is to the best interests of their!: that the Masai should inhabit one area.&quot;650. On the 4th April,  1911, an Agreement was reacl between the Governor (the late Sir Percy Girouard) and the l\\ representatives, the text of which will be found in Appendix M It provided that the Masai should leave the Northern Eeserve J be united in one area, the Southern Deserve being extended! this purpose.   The area of the extension for which provision made in the Agreement was approximately 5,S50 square mile; the position shown on the map following Appendix No. S to vfj allusion, has already been made.   Subsequent further extensions also shown in this map with the dates at which they were made!651. The move began in June, 1911, and proceeded through] July and August of that year by four different routes converging the Mau in the neighbourhood of the &quot;Promised Land.&quot; a hitch occurred owing to numbers of Alasai with their stock ( gregating in that area.  There was great congestion and the M suffered some losses in cattle.   They consequently returned to European farm areas between Njoroand Elmenteita and for at. the move was suspended.   The check had, however, affected

The move recommenced in e  1912, and was completed by the following March.652. After the decision of Government to continue the move Tune   1912, the agitation to return to Laikipia became more e and Mr. A. Morrison, a local lawyer, was approached and up the case on behalf of the Masai.   On the 28th June Mr. rison addressed the Colonial Office intimating that he had been -acted by Legalishu to take proceedings against the Govern-i on behalf of the Masai, and an action was brought in May, against (lie Attorney General, which was dismissed with s by the Chief Justice. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for tern Africa in December was.also dismissed, it being held :  (1) The East African Protectorate is in relation to the Crown a foreign country in which the Crown has jurisdiction which is  exercisable in accordance with the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1900, and Orders-in-Council thereunder. (2) The Masai, though living in the Protectorate under the protection of the Crown, were capable of entering into Agreements with the Governor, and such Agreements were in fact Treaties and, as such, claims thereunder are not cognizable in the Protectorate Courts.653. The boundaries of the Masai Reserve as defined in the re-inforcement of 1911 were subsequently amended very greatly to the -antage of the, Masai.54. The first addition was to the west of the Mara area where le 920 square miles were added in the position shown on the p.  The principal reason for this extension was that, when the northern Masai moved from Laikipia into the extension area of Southern Reserve which had been provided for their use, they ml it already occupied by the Southern Masai who had en-ached into it with their flocks and herds, so that the accommoda-n proved insufficient for them and the extension across the Mara granted. Reports on this Trans-Mara region submitted by the -ector of Agriculture, the Director of Public Works, Mr. J. K. . Manager of the Government Farm, and Mr. C. 0&apos;N.

The Governor, in view of the eminent desirability of eluding all the Masai in one reserve, felt compelled to recomtrii that this further area be allotted to the Masai, and it was acco] ingly included in the boundaries as defined by Proclamation dal the 23rd of July. 1912. The boundaries of the extended area described in the Proclamation were of a provisional character. ; were subsequently slightly modified.656. A further addition to the reserve was made later so as include the Masai of the Laitokitok, who had for many years habited the area on the northern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro the direction of the Kombo River.   These Masai were forme included in the Seyidie (now Coast) Province and had been ministered from Taveta.  This extension added 3,730 square mi657. Further smaller, but not inconsiderable, additions to reserve were made on the Mau in view of the special request of i Masai before signing the 1911 Agreement, that as much as possible of the area known as the &quot;Promised Land&quot;, for which applicaii had been made by Mr. Powys Cobb, should be given to them. Th minor extensions comprised 327 square miles.Note. The total of these areas is 15,177 square miles. Th have been exclusions amounting to 380 square miles. The balari is, therefore, 14,797 square miles, which is the total area of i Masai Reserve as at present gazetted.The Kinangop circumcision exchange mentioned in secti 696 below, which provided, on balance, a further area of 110 squ: miles for the Masai, has not been taken into account, since tl exchange has not yet been formally completed by gazettement.658. The present population of the Masai according to t latest official figure is 48,381. The reserve is 14,797 square mi! in extent and the density is therefore only about three to tgg. square mile. That is to say that the average Masai househ of five persons has an allowance of over one and a half square mil of country to itself. The official estimate of the number of cat for 1930 is 720,000, but a more recent actual count made by t Veterinary Department in the Kajiado District indicates that t numbers are much in excess of that estimate and are probal more than a million. The number of sheep and goats is given the 1930 estimate as 820,450 and the number of donkeys as 171.8C The allowance per household of five, based on the official estimafc is therefore 74 cattle, 85 sheep or goats and 18 donkeys, but in all probability considerably more.659. The fact that the Masai have been able to accumulate a&apos; maintain such vast flocks and herds in their reserve speaks for itseinMet th tion,
MASAI province-Chaeusb I]The Masai Agreements398060. It is interesting to compare the conditions in respect of uilation density with those obtaining in Kikuyu and Kavirondo. iile in Masai an area of 14,797 square miles supports a popula-n of 48,381 at a density of about three to the square mile, the ee districts of Kikuyu piroper comprise 1,726 square miles (as etted) supporting a population, which according to the latest cial figures numbers 4S9,156, at a density of 283 to the square and the three Kavirondo native reserves have an area of ]4 square miles,   with  a  population  officially  stated  to  be 29,422, and a density of 145 to the square mile; it must be embered, however, that the Masai are a pastoral tribe, while Kikuyu and Kavirondo are mainly agricultural. The basis of calculation for the Kikuyu figures given above s in Note 4 to section 67.661. Such great discrepancies cannot be explained simply bydifference in the quality of the land. Although there are certain d and waterless tracts in the Masai country, as is bound to becase in so large an area, and parts are fly-infested, the greater t of the reserve includes some of the finest agricultural and total land in Kenya&apos;, and the Masai are probably the most althy tribe in Africa, both in the matter of land and the stock ich they are able to keep on it.  The agricultural land comparesunfavourably with that in the neighbouring Kikuyu sub-district Dagoretti, which is densely inhabited.662. The Masai make little or no use of their agricultural land, e Kikuyu are desirous of cultivating it and are in fact cultivat-on a small scale on the Ngcng hills and other jnaces, but on &apos;ery precarious form of tenure.663. In view of the fact that the Alasai were a decaying and aclent race when British administration was established and t the protection given them, in all probability, saved them from aster, it seems clear that they have been treated in an unduly erous manner as regards land. A comparison of the sparsity in ich their reserve is inhabited with the density obtaining among &quot;labouring tribes shows how notable a degree of maldistribution sts, and, if it is not fair to describe this state of things entirely the Agreement, it is at least true that the Agreement is the ncipal obstacle in the way of ameliorating the position. The ole matter is an excellent illustration of the harm which may be e by the locking up and permanent entail of land, and by too at a zeal for security at the expense of fluidity.664. Under our first term of reference we are required to con-er the needs of the native population, present and prospective, h respect to land, and the questions of distribution, interpenetra-and fluidity are extremely pertinent.   But in respect of allComparison with the Population Density in Kikuyu and Kavirondo.Comparison with Kikuyu in respect of tlie Quality of the Land.Generous Treatment of the Masai.Effect of the Agreements.
MASAI PROVINCE Part II-Chapter I] The Masai Agreedthat part.of the Masai Reserve to which the Agreement of Km applies, that is to say, the areas marked A and B on the ml following Appendix No. 8, the land is declared to be reserved! the exclusive use and benefit of the Arasai tribe, and Gc-vernin! lias agreed not to convey any land within the boundaries, as dcfirB in the Agreement, by lease or grant to any person without the l sent of -the paramount chief and the representatives of tlio trill excepting only in the case of laud required for public purposes or I mining. From this it is clear that not only Europeans, but el natives of other tribes are precluded from obtaining land in I Masai Reserve on any reasonable security, unless the Masai thel selves agree.   This they are unlikely to do.605. A strict insistence on the letter of these clauses would tl only be an impediment to leases but would also prevent the --I siderable amount of peaceful penetration by Kikuyu which is aliel in progress. Many Alasai marry Kikuyu wives who frequently bril members of their family along with them, and the Masai husbal as a relation-in-law, seldom or never objects.  In this way an arl cultural settlement begins and the Masai tribe gains a reinforceral of which it is greatly in need.   But these arrangements might I held to infringe the clause which requires that the land should 1 used for the exclusive use and benefit of the Masai tribe, and i: probable that, if these cases, instead of being settled on a frier footing between relatidns-indaw, were to he referred to the clii and representatives of the tribe, they would object and the it would lose even the few agriculturists which it now possesses4 get her with the force of their example.660. Again, it may very well be to the advantage of a tri that land not required for present or near future use should leased. It is better for land to be used than to lie idle, and: Native Council would receive the rents. The elders of the trii having no experience in such matters, may object unreasonably, the detriment of the tribe, and therefore it may be in the k interests of the tribe that, within defined limits and subject appropriate safeguards, there should be a power to over-ride si objections in the general interest of the tribe. This is an accep: principle of the Lands Trust Ordinance in respect of other trilt If it is a right principle, as we are convinced that it is, it can o: be to the disadvantage of the Masai to be excluded from operation.667. From these considerations we are satisfied that too ri an adherence to the terms of the Agreement is not in the 1 interests of the -Masai.        -4       -
399II Chapter I]MASAI province the Masai Agreements068. When we turn from the interests of the Masai and con-.r the interests of other tribes, it is clear that the permanent [tail of a vast area of land for the benefit of a tribe which makes iittle use of it and, left to itself, would certainly not be able keep it, must appear unjust; especially when one, at least, of the ifffibouring tribes is living in a state which borders on congestion, ibody wishes to deprive the Masai of their land, but justification .&apos;i)t arise for requiring them to lease unused portions of it to other lies&apos;., or to individual, natives. u69. Besides the leasing of land which they do not require, re are several advantageous exchanges which the Masai mighttunge with great profit to themselves and to the Colony at large, 1 we shall refer to some of them in sections 693-711 below.670. It may perhaps be arguable that the Kenya Annexation liler-in-Gouncii dated 11th June, 1920, had the effect of rendering i Masai Agreement null and void. But we are not so much con-ned with the position in law as with the position in equity, andare fully persuaded that the Masai are in equity entitled to all : benefits of the Agreement just as if it were still in force. But at does not mean that the Agreement cannot be amended by the initiation or modification of clauses which are not in reality bene-il to the Masai.671. We hold that our obligation towards the Masai is exactly-same as it is towards all the other tribes of Kenya, namely, to Jopose such amendments of the ILands Trust Ordinance and such feguards as will ensure that ail the native reserves are used and developed to the best advantage of the occupant tribes, subject only the acquisition of land for public purposes or purposes essential to s welfare of the Coionv.  In so far as we are successful in doiii;? we consider that the special clauses now relating to leases or ences in the Masai reserve should be discontinued.   There is :nething invidious and a trifle absurd in the position that a par-tiiar method of lease or licence should be considered just and ailabie for other tribes, but not for the Masai.   Our duty is to vise a method which is just to all of them, and we shall address selves to that task in the third part of our Beport (Bart III, apter HI, passim).672. The Masai can only stand to gain by the elimination of guards which are of no practical use or value to them and can ly hinder their progress. If they remain in isolation in their reserve, as they will have to do if it is to be developed for their dusive use find benefit, they are likely to stagnate and further wnerate, and large areas of valuable agricultural land, either arely unused on account of fly or East Coast Fever or used onlyEffect of theKenyaAnnexationOider-in-Council.

Secondly, there are within the confines of the Beserve considerable areas of excellent  agricultural land, remain largely unused owing to the prevalence of fly and East fever and the conservative adherence of the Masai to a s: pastoral mode of life.   Without doubt, this land would be of value to other tribes or communities who may require scot expansion or agricultural development.  We consider that il be of advantage to the Masai, should they be willing, to cede of this land in exchange for the Chyulu Triangle, or any othe which they may desire and which may be available.   Siv changes, could they be arranged, would be of undoubted vahii only to the Masai as a tribe, but also to the Colony as a. v But the result of preliminary inquiries made by the office i ministering the tribe does not encourage us to believe tha Masai are at present willing to entertain any7 such suggestic683.

The description in this notice runs, in part, as follows :  &apos;0n the north this reserve is bounded by the Mbagathi ream and by the Athi River . . . thence in a north-easterly ection to the peak of Donyo Nyuki (Suswa); thence in a thern direction to the point where  the Mbagathi River es.&quot;By a further clause in the 1911 Agreement the Governorreserve for the exclusive use of the Masai tribe the.area on e south side of the Uganda Railway as defined above, and as own on the attached map, which area is coadunate with the buthern Masai Native Reserve . . .&quot;therefore quite clear that the. Southern Masai Reserve as in the 1906 Gazette notice is secured to the Masai by the Agreement.9. Two points are thus proved conclusively although theyot been raised by the Masai :  The land between the Mbagathi and Kisserian streams is Masai Reserve secured by the Agreement with the ex-ception of the land owned in 1904 by the three landlords named above.) That the Laibon Lenana and his successors have lights ofoccupation in this area. 0. It was clearly the intention of Government, with which asai agreed, that all alienated farms south of the Mbagathi should be excluded from the Masai Reserve, and it was by an oversight that three of the farms were excluded and er three, or parts of them, were not.1. So far as can be ascertained, parts of the following farms e considered as being within the Masai reserve :  (1) Farm No. 193 : 643 acres, freehold. (2) Farm No. 196 : 540 acres, freehold. (3) Farm No. 197 : 106 acres, freehold.&apos;2. In our discussion of the claim by the Masai to the Mile and Chyulu Triangle, we adhered to the strict letter of the ents and it is only just that we should adhere to it equally case of these farms, which, as we have seen, are part of the

The proposal known as the Man Forest Exehann which lull details will he found in the Secretary&apos;s Pi emanated from the Conservator of. Forests, whose sufjgt was that the Masai should give up an area of lores; the Forest Department in exchange for an area of grazing on southern extremity of the Eastern Matt Forest Reserve.

This subsidiary exchange has now been effected so the proposal is now that the Masai should receive tin area of 12 acres of Forest Reserve and unalienated Crown land, which is-t able grazing land, in exchange for approximately 13,245 acre forest, which is valueless to the Masai. The Chief Native Com sioner. the Commissioner for Local Government, Lands and Se ment. the Conservator of Forests, the Provincial Comriiissio Masai, and the Provincial Commissioner, Rift Valley, have pressed concurrence. The Alasai have agreed, provided that a; tongue of forest land of about 1,200acres, lying between twoa of grassland, can be thrown into the exchange.695. After consultation with the Conservator of Forests, recommend that this tongue of land be included and the exchequer implemented, making the total which the Masai will receive 11 acres. The tongue, which contains valuable cedar, should be served as Native Reserve Forest Reserve, and a road of acres stock should be provided.696. Land had been reserved in the Kinangop under the Agreement, in order that the Masai might perform certain ens ary circumcision ceremonies in that area. As this area, conipri approximately ten square miles, was isolated and a consider distance from the reserve, it was proposed that the Masai sli be given land in the Kedong Valley, amounting to 118 square in in exchange therefor. The Masai Local Native Council exj re full agreement with the proposal and the exchange is in a operation at present, with the general consent of all parties, recommend that it be regularised.

Area B is a part of the unalienated Crown land adjoining s farms and abutting on the northern boundary of the Alasai reserve, which the Masai would find useful for grazing purposes, which is of little use to the European area in which it is raphicadly situated.

Tt lies of the Mbagathi River between Mbagathi Township Reserve! point a little to the east of the Kapio River. As shown on the it is G9 square miles.  Tt is well watered.707. Area F, about eight square miles, is a stretch of f agricultural land on tin: slopes of the Man near the source Weikei River.   This land was for some years occupied by K tenants of the Kakonyuke Masai who were cultivating about acres of first class agricultural land and raising large crops of and potatoes.  Though normally engaged as wage labourers to yate for the Masai, these tenants were in actual fact payin for the right to occupy.  The area which is covered with fore bush is not occupied by the Masai, whose use of it is restrict a cattle track leading from their grazing grounds on the lower of the Man, to the head-waters of the Weikei River.  The pre Kikuyu tenants were evicted about three years ago for admin tive reasons.708. The total of these three areas (D, E and F), as estin is about 9-3.1 square miles, and the total of the areas for which been suggested that the Masai would be prepared to exchange is 91 J- square mile&quot;. If there is a difference in value on eithei it should be capable of adjustment, and if there is a balar favour of the Masai it could perhaps be made good to the throwing part of the Chyulu Triangle into the exchange.709. Nevertheless, we think it unlikely that the Masai agree to a full exchange, and in view of the difficulties involve recommend that a settlement be attempted on the following Iin(I) That the area C should be leased by the Kikuyn Masai for 99 years, and that the area D should be leased Masai to the Kikuyu for 99 years, rent being assessed in ea on a fair economic basis.Note. if both tribes prefer it, the present friendly an ment could be continued without the necessity of a formal but the principal objection to this, in our eyes, is that the 1

Other possible areas which the Masai might arrangt lease or exchange for a sufficient consideration are the fly am the Trans-Mara and on the Tsavo River; also the lower reaches the Mara River and the lower reaches of the Southern Uaso Ny Only the last two of these areas are in the Agreement boundary, other two being in parts of the reserve which have been added: sequently. The Crown land south of the Rombo River is u coveted by the Masai for grazing purposes, and it is likely they would be prepared to cede substantial areas of fly-infe-but good arable land instead of it. One such area lies in the so eastern corner of the reserve on the upper waters of the I River, the use of which certain Kamba have endeavoured to obi713.

This forest, of nearly 200 square mile: probably more than is required for this purpose, and a consider acreage of good agricultural land, of which the Masai are tin to make any use, could profitably be set aside and leased to o; who are prepared to make use of it.
-Chapter 11]MASAI PROVINCEProblems and RecommendationsA further point which has to be considered in connexion The Gam the Masai claims of right is that a considerable part of their Rl&apos;sprve-he was a gazetted Game Reserve at the time of the 1904 tement and still remains so.f 15. It is evident that the presence of large herds of game nishes the available pasture and might be prejudicial to the lopinent of the Masai Reserve as an efficiently managed pastoral try, which we hope it will ultimately become. 71C. The game would not only consume much of the available Ing, but would also break down fences, and any stepis which be taken towards the eradication of ticks would he nullified.(717. But, with matters as they are, and are likely to remain e near future, the abolition of the Game Reserve at the present would in our opunion be of no advantage to the Masai and tt even be detrimental to them.718. If the abolition of the Game Reserve were decided upon probable that Europeans wotild concentrate mainly on lion ing, with the result that the number of herbivorous game might ncroased rather than diminished.   If, however, the Masai in e show a disposition towards improved pastoral or agricultural rods, any obstacles which the existence of a Game Reserve ented should not be allowed to stand in the way of useful Ilopntent and the Game Reserve should be limited or abolished livcamstances dictate.   Moreover, we feel that if our recom-dations for the compulsory reduction of Masai stock are putJforce, assistance should be given to the Masai in reducing the ber of game in their reserve.

Of the total population of the Machakos Distr 10,165 are stated to be resident on European farms in the disi as squatters. If allowance is made for this fact, the density in reserve is reduced to 106 to the square mile. It is also estimi that at least 2,000 Machakos Kamba and 6,000 Kitui Kanibtt resident outside the Province, partly in Nyeri, Fort Hall Embu Districts and partly as squatters on alienated farms in Thika sub-district; these are not included in the census fa given above.721. These figures of population density are subject to very   important   qualification   that,   for   topographical  reasu the distribution of the population is far from uniform.

As licer of the Department of Agriculture has been stationed in ,mvince of recent years, until about a year ago, no figures or Is of production are available, and a general note on the condi-jof agriculture in each district, embodying such information as pplied by the evidence and memoranda before us, is all that ie attempted.&apos;2o.

It has been calculated on this basis that the area of the reserve under actual cultivation amounts to ap-inately 140,000 acres, with an additional 70,000 acres lying1726. Thus, in respect of each family of five, the average area-cultivation is approximately three acres, while one and a halfi lie fallow. Without doubt there is considerably more cultiva-in the Machakos District than is generally&quot; realized, and,ennore, it appears to be of a comparatively high standard./27. The evidence before us shows that it is generally con-ed by those who ai-e in the best position to know, that the area le present Native Reserve is sufficient for the agricultural re-Inents of the people at the moment and in the immediate le; but it has been urged byr the Provincial Commissioner that more distant future needs of the district in this connexion Ire careful consideration.

It may be argued that as the area of the reserve-is 240 acres and the estimated area under cultivation and fallow : 210.000 acres, there is great opportunity for agricultural ex-1m. This argument has considerable force and We agree with erally, but qualification is necessary.

In many places the nature of the soil does not lemii to effective agricultural use under present native methods of J tion, but with an increased knowledge of the principles o farming it will be possible to develop considerable areas hi deemed uncuitivable. Improved methods of cultivation also; enable higher yields to be produced from areas now tilled.&apos;780. Another item which must be taken into aecoul visualizing future agricultural development in the MmJ district is that a large area amounting to two or three thousand acres is at present uninhabited owing to tsetse fly] likely that this area may possess considerable agricultural potei ties, if the laud is cleared of fly and if suitable methods farming are applied. But in many parts there are steep hill which may be suitable for planting timber, but do not peril cultivation.731. Further, there hits been a very considerable anioul erosion due to overstocking, reckless cutting of timber, and I causes, though we are glad to learn that public opinion is becoming opposed to wanton destruction of timber, but t!i;J natives tire planting up considerable areas. For this, both the the officers concerned deserve credit. Our general impressioni tour through the district was that erosion, though serious, scarcely so great as is commonly believed. Reconditioning sdj should prove both practicable and profitable in the locations! are at present eroded.732. No statistics relating to agricultural production Kitui District are available.   The District Commissioner rei that in point of area there is adequate land for future aiiticiij development, but the difficulty is largely one of water More and better water facilities are necessary733. We shall now turn to consideration of the Kami stock owners, and our analysis will show that the problem is sea The overstocking of the Machakos Native Reserve in particular been common knowledge throughout the Colony for some I past, and we feel that it is desirable that a full statement ol facts should be made.734. It has been estimated that the stock owned by the K in the Afaehakos District, including those on farms, amoun 248,805 head of cattle and 310,388 sheep and goats.  Tn ad; there are some 20,000 cattle owned by squatters on farms oi the district (evidence of the Provincial Commissioner, Mr. Butler, p. 1319).   We shall examine these figures from two pi of view, first, as to whether the number of stock is propiortHj to the needs of the people, and secondly, as to whether the able grazing land is sufficient to carry the stock.
UKAMliA PROVINCEill Chapter 111]Economic Survey40735. The average number of stock owned by a family of five iroximately five head of cattle and six and a half sheen and It is thus apparent that if, as we think we may fairiy do, cept six head of cattle as a reasonable quota for a family in li-agricultural tribe like the Kamba, then the people might have more stock without the number owned by the&apos; average being unduly high.   It is therefore erroneous to assume that [achakos Kamba are an exceedingly wealthy tribe as regards the Silk and the Masai tire very much better oil&apos; in this -t. but these hitter arc!, of course, almost entirely pastoral. 6. it should be noted thai in addition to their cattle, the lit possess considerable  numbers of sheep and  goats.   At Jit. however, these sheep and goats can only be considered in M of meat and not of milk, because the practice of drinking milk is uncommon.if the!7. It cannot be questioned that a large proportion a cattle are of an uneconomic character.   There aremanys bulls and barren cows which are merely parasites and could ie slaughtered, and the grazing, thereby rendered available, to support milch cows and their calves. An improvement in uality of the stock, even if accomjjanied by a diminution in uantity, would render more milk available and improve the rid consequently the physique of the people.aa. The acreage available in  the native reserve for every of cattle owned by the Machakos Kamba appears to be in the bourhood of four acres.   We reach this figure by taking the area of the Machakos native reserve (approximately 1,385,000 deducting 250,000 acres for fly-infested areas and 140.000 for land in cultivation and dividing the result by the total er of cattle owned by the Machakos Kamba as given  in u 734 above, viz. approximately 269,000.   But it must be ibered that the reserve by itself is not called upon to carry umber, but that very considerable relief is afforded by the ouring settled area in.which the squatters&apos; cattle are kept, 11 as by the permissive use of the Yatta Plateau.9. After every allowance for such external assistance has made, it appears to be the case that each hundred acres in serve, which is neither under cultivation nor fly-belt, has to i&apos;t stock which cannot be far short of twenty cattle and thirty and goats.

I it is reasonable to assume that at present the average carrj capacity of the land throughout the reserve is one head of c: to thirty acres, apart from the sheep and goats. We think his views are somewhat pessimistic; but, in any case, it is evidi that the reserve is carrying several times the number of stock \vf it- can support in its present condition.741. The   economic   problem  which  presents  itself Machakos District is briefly : This semi-pastoral people possess no more live slock than t require (although many of those which they have are of a use type), but, notwithstanding this, they own several times more f their country in its present condition can well support. We thj fore consider that more grazing should be made available, and si make recommendations in the next chapter.742. But an increase of land, granted unconditionally, will of itself solve the problem. Such an extension would quic become filled with the natural increase of the present stock, anc its turn be destroyed by overstocking, and so the situation wo be aggravated rather than alleviated.743. In the case of the Kamba, any increase of land whl may be made on economic grounds should be accompanied in first instance by a reduction of the number of inferior stock : by a concerted scheme for reconditioning areas which have b\ destroyed.744. The stock in the Kitui District have never been count! The District Commissioner estimates that the total number is sol where between 220,000 and 240,000 cattle and between 400,1 and 500,000 sheep and goats. This, being purely a guess, lmistl accepted with the utmost reserve.745. If these figures are approximately correct, it would apnl that the Kamba of Kitui District have at least adequate numb! of stock for their economic needs, and are better off in this res] than their Machakos brethren.743. The District Commissioner informs us that the reservj carrying more stock than it can well support, although there not so many signs of the hind being destroyed through overstoj ing, as in the Machakos District. He attributes this partly to fact that some of the natives are nomadic and, during the ni season, penetrate with their stock into parts of the district outs the native reserve which are normally uninhabited owing to ij of water.ft 8

We do not take this to denote if there is no land over which common rights of pasturage exist, I rather that special reservations are permitted. Such reserva-ns are known as Ific.se (sing., Kisese), and they seem to be the nature of temporary grazing areas, rights in which lapse if i family moves to another part of the district.749.

This difficulty is clearly expressed in the Report &apos; the Native Economic  Commission   (Union of South Africa),2, para. 105, where it is stated : &quot;It is not possible by the voluntary act of individual owners to bring about any necessary limitation of the numbers of cattle grazing on the commonage.

The term Yatta is applied generally to an area of st 946 square miles of unalienated Crown land, bounded on the by the Thika settled area, on the south-west and south hv Machakos Native Reserve, and on the north by the Mwea ex sion of the Kikuyu Native Reserve.

TJKAMBA PROVINCELI Chapter IV]Problems and Recommendations409754. It would seem that, in pre-Goverument days, the grazing nds on the Yatta Plateau proved a constant hone of contention veen the tribes which lived in their neighbourhood. Several 3 names commemorate the struggles which took place between Kamba and Masai, e.g. Mwakini Hill (from Mwaki, fire), ;h is the name of a hill of commanding eminence where Kamba on fires used to be lighted in order to warn the tribe of the oach of the Masai marauders, and Mwita Siano, which meansempty out the arrows&quot; (i.e. from the quiver) in preparation for[engagement.  Both these names are Kikamba.755. We have unfortunately no further material evidence con-ning early conditions on the Yatta Plateau. One thing is tain, that the Kamba had not the permanent and exclusive use the area, and therefore they have not a complete claim of righton grounds of ancient occupation, though they have a nebulous im in respect of intermittent grazing over an indeterminate area.756. Ever since 1913 the natives hjive on numerous occasions i given permission to graze their cattle on the Yatta Plateau [licence.   This permission has not been withheld since 1924,has sometimes been granted on payment of grazing fees and lietimes free of charge. But during this period it has always jii represented to the Kamba that the land is not theirs as ofExtent to which&apos; the Kamba havo been allowed to use the Yatta in later vears.757. The economic survey which we made in the last chapter l-.vs that, although the average household has not more cattle are necessary for its requirements, the reserve is already over-ed, and we are of opinion that it cannot be reconditioned tout the provision of more land, and any scheme for improve-would be heavily handicapped if land of which the Kamba ady have the permissive use were to be taken away.  The last ion on which permission to use the Yatta Plateau was with-n was in 1924, and heavy mortality of stock ensued, partly account of stock diseases and partly through starvation.   We efore consider that the Yatta Plateau should be added to the ba Native Beserve on economic grounds.   This will remove apprehension on the score that the use of it may again be ed to the tribe.75S. We shall not propose that the Kamba should have the inder of the Yatta as we do not consider that it is required by on economic grounds; moreover it is, in our opinion, required tisfy the future needs of other natives.  We have already pro-i that the northern part of it be added to the Kikuyu Native rve as an extension (Class B. 1) on economic grounds, and we deal with the eastern part beyond the Mwita Siano at a later in our Report.The extent to which the use of the Yatta is necessary tc the Kamba.

We do not deny that the Kamba had certain claim, historical grounds to an extent that they made intermittent partial use of the land, and this might give colour to a claim tj proportion of the land, perhaps a quarter, should be added tot territory as Class A. When we deal, in the third pan of Report, with the distinctive safeguards to be provided for &quot;A&quot; &quot;B. 1&quot; areas, it will be appreciated that the distinction is not vital, and in either case an adequate security is conferred. Bin claim, nevertheless, is worth something, and we propose to sat it. While the Yatta Plateau, in our submission, should be western: as Class B. 1, we shall recommend that satisfaction for the i of right should be found by a grant of a further area as Cla; The position of this area will be shown below (sections 783 to&quot;761. We recommend as an absolutely essential conditioi the addition of the Yatta Plateau to the Kamba Native Rest that the grant be accompanied by strict conditions of consent and that a scheme of utilization be formulated, wdiich should; as it principal object the reconditioning of the reserve.762. It will be noticed that we have recommended the I Plateau to be added to the &quot;Kamba Native Reserve&quot; and specifically to the Machakos (Ulu) Reserve or to the Kitui Re? This is because in the third part of our Report we shall re mend that, for all purposes of the Lands Trust Ordinance, Kamba Reserves should be regarded as one. (Schedule folio section 1510.)763. The natives state that since the 1906 boundary of reserve was proclaimed, a strip of land of varying width has lost to them on their western boundary. A study of the maps^ that the new boundary has been of a give-and-take character, although in some places small areas have been excised from reserve, in others they have been added, and it would appear the map that any gain or loss on balance is small.764. At the same time, we are advised by the Survey De ment that owing to the loose wording of the 1906 definition, i proved impossible accurately to delineate the boundary on a and therefore any figures based on an attempt to put it on , must be accepted with the utmost reserve. But, owing t give-and-take nature of the boundary, we are satisfied tha tribe as a whole has no ground for complaint, though poClaim in respect of the Western Boundary between Maehakos and Sultan Hamud.

As the natives feared to be dissatisfied with the present position, we requestedProvincial Commissioner to arrange for detailed statements to worded from any natives who felt that they had suffered definiteby the altered -boundary. 187 statements were recorded by the trict Officers at Machakos, and a precis of these statements compulsory in evidence (pp. 1396 to 1419).765. The Provincial Commissioner, in forwarding these state-Its commented : &quot;After careful consideration, I have arrived at the following delusions : (a) That there was more than adequate land in the reserve to accommodate the natives evicted by the alteration of the boundaries.(6) That the occupation of land between the 1906 boundary and the present boundary occurred in the early part of this century.(cei That most of the evicted occupantstf having been born within the boundaries of the present reserve, as them statements show, returned on eviction to the place of their birth.((/) That, though some losses of cattle did occur as a result of a change from one climate to another, they were nothing like as extensive as alleged.(e) That the alteration of the boundary being on a give-and-take basis, except for the area in the vicinity of Machakos, no injustice was suffered by the Kamba- as the result of that alteration.(/) That, except for the country in the vicinity of Machakos, the evictions along the boundary effected by Mr. Dundas and others were in the nature of steps to prevent the encroachment by Kamba across the established boundary.((/) It is clear that the Kamba in the vicinity of Alachakos suffered some hardship through loss of grazing by the alteration of the 1906 boundary. The land excluded, about 3,600 acres is known as L.O. 1491 and was cer-tn-iniy used extensively for grazing by the Kamba after the 1906 boundary was proclaimed.The evictions detailed in the statements relate to a period enty years ago or more ; and it is a well-known fact that the istrict Commissioners concerned at the time were strong in the pport of native interests and would not have stood by if the
TJKAMBA PROVINCE Part II Chapter IV] Problems and Recommendanatives had had to endure the serious losses of stock they allege. Having worked in the Machakos District as Asst District Commissioner during 1911, I speak with some s knowledge of these facts. That some hardship and inconveni occurred there is no doubt, but that heavy losses were suffer extremely improbable.&quot;766. We are in general agreement with the Provincial ( missioner&apos;s conclusions. We consider that whatever hardshi any, individuals may have suffered through the alteration o! boundary will be amply compensated by7 the recommenda which we shall make.Claim to the 767. By a former gazettement of the Native Beserve bounArea Parm       in 1906, the Mua Hills are shown as part of the Native Res.We.are satisfied that the land was extremely sparsely occupied that the inclusion of the Matungulu Hills in the Native lie: was generally understood to be an exchange for it. The evidence of Colonel Ainsworth and the Reverend C. P. Johnston leave doubt in our minds.768. Colonel Ainsworth was the I.B.E.A. Company&apos;s Sap tendent at Machakos from 1892 to 1s96, and subsequently Majesty&apos;s Sub-Commissioner in charge of the Ukamba Prov and in that capacity he continued at Machakos until 1899. states in his memorandum that in those early days the a boundary was approximately north from the station (Mach; through Kasinga to the slopes in the bend in the hills for: the junction between the Iveti and the Mua hills, then fa short distance on the eastern slope of Mua, to a point where] stream bed runs out to Kasinga; that with, the exception oft!) small area the Mua hills were not in any way occupied by i Kamba before 1s96,  in which year, owing to an outbreak rinderpest in the country east of the Iveti mountains, he e permission to the Iveti natives to move their cattle to that ar and there was an understanding that, when the rinderpest epides was over, the cattle should be moved back.769. The Bev. C. P. Johnston, the oldest non-official reside in Kamba country, whose experience dates from 1899, states t! the Mua hills were not occupied by the Kamba before the statii at Machakos w7as built.&quot;The top of the Iveti hills used to be the limit. T (the Kamba) came to look over and had their outposts watcj ing the Masai and whenever they had the opportunity : drove their cattle down on to the plains. It was not until boma was established that they really came down on t &apos; western side . . . with their kraals and their gardens ai cultivation . . .
UKAMBA PROVINCE l _chapter IV] Problems and Recommendations&apos;&apos; They had begun to go into the Mua hills shortly after the famine. Then during Sir James Hayes-Sadler&apos;s time they were moved out of the Mua hills and that was thrown open to European settlement and they were given the territory in the north in place of the Mua hills.&quot; . .       ,.Irespect of the land given in exchange, Le. the Matungulu &apos;&apos;.tion, he states in his memorandum :  &apos;rny first eighteen months in the country were spent at our Mwisuni Station in the Kangundu Location. Drawing a line east and west through that station would cut off a large slice from the present reserve, and in that area there were no people whatever at that time (1899).. This area has now a population of around 20,000.   In .1900 they began to drive their cattle :.&apos; .out to pasture in this area but they were brought home at night. When they were convinced that all danger for Masai was past they built cattle kraals out there (1900-01) and shortly whole villages were moved out.&quot;   (Evidence, pp. 1436-1444&apos;).770. We are satisfied that the addition of the Matungulu loca-to the Native Eeserve was a full set-off for any small loss of tt-s which may have occurred on the Mua hills, and it is note-[thy that a resolution by the Machakos Local Native Council on 27th June, 1932, in order to debate matters for submission-to the Commission contains the following clause : &quot;From Donyo Sabuk to crossing of Machakos-Nairobi Road, Mugongoni (Muvongoni) River : there is no complaint   . .   &apos;.-regarding this section of the boundary.&quot;771. Our reason for including the matter in our survey is the lability of removing any misapprehension.   It is to be notedMr. Johnston considers that the Kamba have been generously Ited with regard to the area gazetted as reserve, though he Iks that they require more grazing and that the Yatta Plateau lid be adequate in this respect.772. Ngaleni Farm is an area of approximately 100 acres in a Slainl *u [nil part of the reserve.  The Kamba allege that when the free- l.o  &quot;geg   rmgrant was originally applied for by Mr.  Stuart Watt, no Iction was raised by the natives, because they understood that [land would be used for mission purposes, and that it was in used for such purposes for a number of years.   It is now a farm.773. The Kamba claim to the land is not disputed, but the nsive additions which we shall propose to be made to the Native     &apos;&apos; &apos;  &apos;;&apos;/&apos;. 3i&apos;ve in another quarter (section 791, below) will provide ade- -e compensation to the tribe, and we have no evidence that any ! &quot;&apos; 1[ lviduals have been adversely affected or have special claims.  At

Details of- the Momandu Farm exchange proposal wj we recommend will be found in the Secretary&apos;s precis (EviderJ pp. 1281-1282). The suggestion is that some 20 acres of L.O. 1740 be exchanged for a corresponding area of an out-span, I No. 304, in order to permit of the Kamba driving their stock al a certain road without breach of quarantine regulations. All pat; have agreed to the proposal which awaits provision of the necess legal machinery, and we recommend that it be implemented.775. The boundary between the Machakos Deserve and all. ated farms passes over the crest of Mwani Hill, half of which in the Deserve and half in L.O. No. 1758, which has reverted the Crown. The natives ask that the boundary may be adjusij so that tlie whole of the hill may be included in the reserve, reason adduced is that the hill is sacred to them according to custi and is used for religious purposes.77G. The claim has the support of the Provincial Coniiul sioner and, the adjacent farm having now reverted to the Croul no private interests could be adversely affected. For these reasol we recommend that the claim be granted, and in view of its size that it be a Class A extension..  Some 700 acres are involved!777. The Machakos Local Native Council has asked that j extension of the Native Deserve should be made to include Em Trading Centre and Railway Station within the Machakos Nali Reserve. The suggested extension consists of a corridor two mi! wide meeting the railway at points approximately one mile w and one mile east of Emali Station respectively.778. The Kamba have at piresent access to the railway means of public roads, although their reserve has no actual poij of contact.   It is argued that it would be advantageous for i future development of Emali Trading Centre that it should I included in the Native Reserve and thus come under the author] of the Machakos Docal Native Council.779. We are in sympathy with these arguments and recoj mend an ex gratia extension (Class A) of the native reserve! indicated above and embracing Emali Trading Centre.  The tol area so added will amount to approximately three square niiles.1 Crown Land 780. The area of Crown Dand lying between the Ulu FurlRailway  ilntl Emali is in our view suitable for white settlement and sliofbetween Sultan be earmarked for this purpose.

412UKAMBA PROVINCE i [_Chapter IV] Problems and Recommendations781. Although this land is below the altitude which we should disposed, in general, to count as &quot;Highlands&quot; for the purposes the sixth term of reference, we feel that in this case an excep-n is justified, partly because the climatic conditions are such as ivive warrant to this classification ; partly because, if it is not duded in the Highlands it becomes a small detached area between e Native Reserve at Emali  and the European Highlands at titan PTainud; and partly because our recommendations in other -elections. if accepted, will require certain sacrifices of the Euro-an Highlands against which this addition will be a  partial, oiigh inadequate, off-set.782. We recommend that an area of approximately 100 square Land to East, iles (the exact boundaries to be determined by survey) to the of Emtm-st of Emali should remain at the disposal of the Crown. Tn iking this recommendation, we have in mind the possibility of rnba as a site for a blood and bone fertilizer factory, in which ent we consider this area would be required as a grazing area in nnexion with the factory. If, however, it is not required for this rpose it should be available as a p area irrespective of race.783. The remainder of the Crown land north of the railway The remainde some 512 square miles, situated as shown in the map which Lan^Nort^o lows this chapter.   The Provincial Commissioner and the Dis- the Railway, ct Commissioner. Machakos, have proposed that this area should made Native Reserve, and that the Chyulu sub-location of the kumbuliu Native Reserve should revert to the Crown.  The area this sub-location is approximately 389 square miles so that there uld be a net gain of approximately 123 square miles to the iinba, if the proposal were implemented.784. The population of the Chyulu sub-iocation is approxi-tely 3,194, and it is estimated that at least 70 per cent are itlent outside the reserve on the Crown hind between the reserve il the railway. The reason for this is that the water supply in yulu is inadequate, and the natives are largely dependent on the of the railway pipe line. This they apparently enjoy at present means of an unofficial arrangement with the Railway Adminis-tion. Their position is therefore irregular, and their country ospitable, wdiile the Chyale sub-location and the Crown land, future of which we aie considering, are represented as much fer country. The Cln^ale sub-location in particular is said to excellent land and sparsely inhabited. Therefore, according to Administrative Officers it would be greatly to the benefit of Chyulu natives to be moved.785. A second argument is that the proposal would have the ft of concentrating all the Kamba north of the railway line.
UKAMBA PROVINCE Part II Chapter IV] Problems and Recommend.ukthus consolidating the Machakos Reserve and facilitating the; ministration of the tribe and the provision of roads and sot service centres.786. The natives themselves, while not at present desiring move, admit that the great distances, which they have now travel for water, are a serious problem, and that the removal their honey boxes from Chyulu would not prove a great hardship,787. We are in full agreement with the Provincial Coinn. sioner, and recommend : (1) That the Ohyulu natives be moved north of the raihvai(2) That the Chyulu sub-location revert to the Crown.(3 That the 512 square miles of Crown land, which we. considering, be made Native Reserve, Class A.788. AVe do not cons; ler that there is any obligation on Gi eminent to compensate individuals for disturbance caused by ; move. Should the Kamba feel that any of the 3,194 natit concerned suffer undue hardship, the Local Native Council, in ct sideration of the substantial addition to the tribal land, should ma provision for the necessary compensation.789. We further recommend that Government should o] negotiations with the Church of Scotland Mission, who own ; intervening land, with a view to obtaining access for the Kami between what will be the main native reserve and the Mbwinz block, by exchange or otherwise.790. The land to which the Chyulu natives would be requir to move is substantially better than that which they wrould vacat and they, in company with the rest of the tribe, would ga materially from the consolidation of the reserve and the clos administration and better services to be expected from it. AVe -not therefore consider that there is any obligation to the Chyc natives that the land given in exchange should be greater in extension than the land vacated.791. But in fact the land to be added is greater by 123 square miles than the land to be ceded, and as far as a settlement with t tribe is concerned we regard this as a fair set-off against the sni losses of rights which we have had occasion to notice in other pa of the reserve. As far as individuals are concerned we consid that the settlement is also just, for the losses of which complai is made all relate to grazing land, and, although certain private reservations of grazing are possible under the Kisese system, it still, in general, true to say that grazing is a common rather th a private right.   In any case we do not think that a more j
PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE.

TJKAMBA PROVINCE XI Chapter IV] Problems and Recommendationsifbtion can be found for the settlement of private grievances aris-from such disturbance as may have been caused by the alienated-3P of certain lands a generation ago.792. We do not suggest that the 512 square miles to be added ^Kuld be divided into distinct areas, of which 889 square miles fluid go to the Chyulu natives and 123 square miles be directed Bother purposes in connexion with general compensation to the %c. There would be no advantage in such a course. We recoin-fiul that the land be a simple addition to the tribal territory, and It the Chyulu natives should be accommodated in it or move to er homes in the reserve as may seem to them best or as their tern of land tenure may allow. We do not doubt but that private is in the land will grow up in course of time, as the method of tl tenure becomes more individual, and we do not anticipate t any special difficulties will arise.793. There has been  a mistake  in  gazetting  the western ^&quot;t^ng6 the udary of the Kitui Native Reserve.   The intended boundary, Kitui Reserve eved to correspond with the historical claims of the natives, Boundary, owed the Manzi Etumo River.   But this river was wrongly vvn .,in the surveyor&apos;s map as being irt the position properly npied by the Miwongoni Biver.  This mistake could easily have n rectified without detriment to the tribe, except for the fact t the surveyors map had become the &quot;Deposited Plan.&quot;794. The  description   in   Government   Notice   No.   394  of ober, 1826, which proclaimed the reserves, made reference to deposited plan, and consequently this mistaken plan now con-utes an authority which cannot easily be set aside, as the Bands ist Ordinance now stands.795. According to a map drawn by Air. A. M. Champion, vincial Commissioner, the area involved is sixty square miles, recommend that it be added to the Kitui Native reserve.796. We have now completed our review of the various prob-s peculiar to Ukamba Brovince. As all the reserves therein are bited by the one tribe, we are of opinion that the utmost free-of movement should be encouraged, and to this end we recom-d that one reserve only should be gazetted. This would include main Machakos Reserve, (he Mbwinzao block of the present imbuliu Reserve and the Kitui Reserve.General Recommend a-tions.

The total laud in the Northern Frontier and Tint Provinces, exclusive of the area inhabited by the West Suit 116,959 square miles, arid the total native population, exclusiy the West Suk, is 120,038, so that the density of population is over one to the square mile- If we were to consider Turk itself, we should find the density to be nearly two and These natives clearly have rights in the land, but they can .-hi! said to 70S.tribes and sections of tribes, which observe any fixed boundaries; in the we are extremely doubtful of the boundaries, since they may have the resn access to grazing lands which are vital to yiously resorted by arrangement with sideration   by  itself would  constitute proclamation of native reserves, even appeared desirable.:).

In the first place the areas are so vast in pr their populations that it would.amount to an unjustifiable up of land, if it were devoted in perpetuity to the exclusiv the occupant  tribes.   It is true that a great proportion country is so arid and inhospitable that it is difficult to see to vi better use it can  be  pint  than  to afford  a home for nom pastoralists.  Rut there may be undiscovered sources of wealth, it would be wrong to  put unnecessary obstacles in development  of  such   possibilities  as  the  land  may  posses: minerals or otherwise.  While it is clearly necessary that the na rights must be safeguarded, the elaborate safeguards which w propose for the protection of Native Reserves under the Trust Ordinance would he unworkable in such a region and inappropriate.\Y;Hl
NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURKANA PROVINCES H_Chapter V] Protection ok Native Rightsahle mcing801. The whole of Turkana is a desolate region of the nature live   described,   but   the   Northern   Frontier   Province,   while pnerally of that character, has also extensive areas of valuable sture-laiid, parts of which are also suitable fir agriculture. These is are worthy of much better use than nomadic tribes cat: give in.  At present any attempts to cultivate are frustrated by the ie which destroys most of the crops, and the natives are quite to cope with the situation either by destroying the game or the land.802. We do not feel hound to reserve such land exclusively for natives, since we do not consider that they have established a M to exclusive joossession either on historical or economic kinds, and we believe that it might be in the best interests of Colony that considerable areas should be leased to non-native dividuals or companies, who have the capital to improve and velop them. We do not consider that it is necessary to insist at. in every ease, such leases shotfld only be granted if they are ectly beneficial to the natives.S03. The employment offered on any farms which may be sed should enable the natives in their neighbourhood to live tit a sity considerably higher than their present average of one to square mile, and it is also to be expected that the natives iployed on the farms will learn lessons in pastoral methods which, lien they return to their homes, they will be able to turn to good mint-S04. This argument must not be carried too far, and it would airly be unjust to alienate the best land to Europeans and leave inferior land to natives.   Although the natives cannot claim sdusive rights, they have a right to be protected and secured in occupation of sufficient land for their needs, and we have aiied ourselves after careful inquiry that their proper protection ps in fact demand that the whole area, good land as well as bad, oiild be kept predominantly for their use and benefit. 805. Our general recommendation in regard to the Turkarm General Northern Frontier Provinces therefore is that, with exceptions :ed at sections 808 and 816 below, the land should not be pre iined Native Reserve nor be regarded as wholly devoted to native tlie Turkana poses; but that it should be recognized as land in which natives and NorthernReeoniraenda-tions eoneern-ins the land ive a prior interest, and leases to non-natives should not be provhiees. j\ved to such an extent as to justify the apprehension that the ives might not have sufficient land remaining for their use. We ther recommend that, although the land should not be Native serve, the priority of native interests should be safeguarded by a eial section under the Lands Trust Ordinance.

Leases which are not of this character she be subject to the approval of the Lands Trust Board; save that the Governor disagrees with the decision of the Board, ; Secretary of State should decide.807. In the case of the Leroki Plateau there are special, ctunstances which have to be taken into account, and we h devoted a chapter (Chapter VI) to their consideration.   The o elusion which we reach is that the above recommendation she apply generally to the Leroki Plateau as well as to other par the Northern Frontier and Turkana Provinces, at least for i years to come, but that leases of large areas to non-natives oi Leroki Plateau should not be allowed except for purposes dir beneficial to natives.   The ultimate destination of this land rite lapse of many years is a matter with which we do not fira necessary to deal.808. We recommend that the reserve proclaimed for the M Suk should remain.   This is an exception to our general reo mendation in section 799 above.   The reasons for the propos the boundaries recommended will be fully stated in Chapter V.809. There are three small sections of Dorobo inhabti Crown land in the North Nyeri District the Mukogodo. Ndigiri, and the Ilimw-esi. All these sections claim to be Don and it would appear that the Ndigiri and Ilimwesi have affini with the Alasai, while it has been suggested that the Mukogt who speak a distinct language, may have affinity with the G; All these sections used to range the forests which at that t covered much of the land which has since been alienated as in the North Nyeri District but, after the farms were alienated gradually moved into the general neighbourhood of the Mukos hills. To this place came also the Mumonyot, a sub-clan of Laikipiak Masai, who were driven out of Laikipia by the PurktThe total strength of these four sections which we shal to as the Mukogodo taken together was found, in a census ta in 1931, to be 110 men, 103 women, and 182 children; with i cattle and 1,695 sheep and goats810.

41We recommend : (1) That the Mukogodo area be detached from the Kikuyu Province and added to the Northern Frontier Province for the purposes of administration.Note. The determination of the exact boundaries can safely be left to Government, but we think that the North Nyeri District Council ought to be consulted as well as the natives concerned.(2) That in so far as the land added may not be sufficient for the natives concerned, either in respect of area or in respect of water facilities, the Provincial Commissioner of the Northern Frontier Province should make the necessary ar-rangeinents to set apart a sufficient area for their use and occupation, with particular regard to water facilities.Note. The question of an adequate water supply is some-what difficult and attention is specially invited to the evidence of Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Pugh (Evidence, pp. 1578 to 1588).(3) That when the Mukogodo country to be ceded by the North Nyeri District has been added to the Northern Frontier Province it should become subject to the same conditions as other land in that province, that is to&apos; say, it should be recognized as an area in which natives have prior, but not exclusive rights.Note. These Dorobo. as has been stated in evidence, have been &quot;driven like chaff before a wind of progression&quot;, and it might be expected that we should now recommend a definite reserve for them. But they are too small a com-rnunity to be treated in isolation and we are satisfied that it is a better solution to combine them in one area with the Northern Frontier Province in the manner suggested. The safeguards recommended for the protection of native rights should suffice to give them all reasonable security.811. There are a few scattered Dorobo in the Laikipia District, The Uaso ibly the Nyambire Dorobo located at the source of the Ainanga Nyambired r and another group on the Uaso-Narok.  We recommend that Dorobo. be moved into the Northern Frontier Province, where suitable mmodation should be found for them.812. Apart from the Northern Frontier Somali tribesmen, The Somaliii. e are a considerable number of alien or immigrant Somalis from a and Somaliland, who are principally engaged in cattle trading, se latter use Isiolo and the Nairobi Commonage as their main res where they keep large herds of cattle, and are in fact hing on Crown land. There are also several of them at Kitale, 1 and other places.NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURKANA PROVINCES j [___Chapter- V] Protection of Native Rights

The question of a reserve for these Somalis lias b mooted. but they are not natives of the Colony; they are foreign &quot;r paying non-native poll tax. While we consider that they hay, right to be allowed to buy land in suitable places, we cannot that they have any claim to a Native Reserve.814. On this subject we are impressed by the comment ra by the District Commissioner, Isiolo, at a District Commission meeting of the Northern Frontier Province in August, 1929. was speaking of the probable consequences of gazetting a Son Reserve, and the minute reads as follows : &quot;He pointed out that Kenya is regarded by the North Somali as an El Dorado, and that there could be a fan infiltration from Northern Somaliland, and that within ten fifteen years tiie problem would have reappeared in a Lira form; the area set apart for the Somalis would have pro insufficient, and the Somalis, having obtained political i-h and power, would then again demand consideration of t: claims.&quot;815. With these observations we entirely agree. We coils: that all legitimate claims of the Somali will be met. if i; provided : (a) That any Somali may apply, on equal terms with olraces, for a lease of land in any area where no spe privilege of race exists, i.e. a &quot;D&quot; area. This iae already exists, but the Somalis have made little or no of it. &quot;(b) That in respect of &quot;C&quot; areas, which are areas in wnatives would, according to our recommendations.

The balance remaining available for the area is some 700 square miles, and we consider that particular &quot;C&quot; area will prove exceptionally suitab Somalis, and they should be encouraged to avail t selves of it.

The Game Warden has submitted a memorandum which he recommends the establishment of a National Game ik in part of the Northern Frontier Province in the neighbour-id of Mount Marsabit, the Matthews and Ndoto Eanges, Mount iro. and the Horr Valley. We see no objection to the proposal, ich does not envisage that the few natives who inhabit the nirv will be displaced, but naturally it must be subject to etfuards, which must provide that the number of animals must kept down to a point at which there is no danger of their sin&quot; impairment to the land.

The Game Warden points out, we think rightly, that the ives will be better oil&apos; iu these respects than if no Game Park &quot;eclared. At jwesent, if elephants or other dangerous game in-&apos;ise to the point of becoming a menace, there is nobody to deal h them, but, if a National Park is declared, a European would pat in charge of it, and it would be part of his duty to deal with li matters.819.

CHAPTER VI.Tho&apos; Areas occupation ed by the samburu.Claims of the Samburu.Questions affecting the Samburu Claims.The Samburu Tribe.THE SAMBURU QUESTION IN RELATION TO Tilt LEROKI PLATEAU.822. No Samburu Native Reserve has been declared, &quot;but Samburu have for some twenty years past been inhabiting plateau known as Leroki in the northern part of Laikipia, in a tion to the very much larger area (over 4,000,000 acres) to the m and east thereof which they have occupied for a much longer per The whole of the area is in the Northern Frontier Province, at map illustrating the regions at present occupied by the. tribe  appended to this chapter.823. The claim of the Samburu to Leroki may be consid both from the historical aspect and from the point of view of t present and prospective needs as regards grazing.824. In consideration of the above it is necessary to give s account of the following relevant questions : (a) Who the Samburu are.(b) How they came to be in the areas they are now occupyCe) (d)Their population and the numbers of their live stock. The extent and character of the land they are occtipyi: and the degree of its adequacy and suitability to &quot;ti: requirements.The claims and objections of other interests and point; issue..825. In the first place we would refer to an able and inter; ing memorandum prepared by Air. H. E. Bader, who was Dish Officer in Charge of the Samburu between June, 1928, and Jiinur 1931, and who by his close association with the tribe and his car study of their history is well qualified to speak.826. Mr. Bader is of opinion that the Samburu come of same stock as the Masai, but Mr. Colvile, who knows the la tribe very well, is not in entire agreement with this opinion, latter gentleman considers the two tribes are only distantly rela if at all, and quoted the difference in the clan names in suppot his views;.but, in consideration of all the evidence, we can conclude that the Samburu and Masai are closely related-on the clan names at least is the same, their physical characteri.&apos; and languages are very similar, and their habits and customs proximate very nearly. Mr. Raymond Hook in his memoram says that the Samburu and Masai are closely related, and tli the opinion also of Administrative Officers who know both tn But the cleavage between them occurred many years ago:
NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURKANA PROVINCES II_CnAiiKR VI] Tub Leroki Plateausince been widely separated, and the Samburu have probably ie [used with Dorobo and other tribes. In the light of these Mr. Colvile&apos;s views are not very divergent.827. The history of the Samburu as related by Lemma, late mount Chief of the Masai, and recorded by Mr. Tate, a former mesial Commissioner, is of interest and is as follows : &quot;Many years ago in the time of Mbatian, father of Lenana, the Laikipiak Masai pastured their herds all over the rass country to the west and north-west of Kenya. A time of drought came and the burnt-up plains became insufficient for pasturing so many cattle and goats, and a migration was de-cided upon. The Laikipiak migrated farther west over the country which is still known by that name (Laikipia), some of them even reaching the Baringo country and thence to the Eldama Bavine and Guaso Ngishu country, where they have to a great extent lost the individuality of their tribe and become more or less merged with the natives of that country. The El Burgo (Purko Alasai), the most powerful tribe, took Ngatabus and the country south-east of it, while the Samburu marched north to the Uaso Nyiro, where they stayed for many years until repeated raids drove them north. These people were originally Laikipiak, and were so called from the Masai word &quot;Samburubur&quot;, meaning a butterfly.&quot;i is no reason to suppose that this story is not substantially ect as the problem of the Samburu had not at that time arisen ; Europeans had even heard of the tribe, and Lenana could have no possible reason for trying to mislead Air. Tate.828. Erom the evidence of the Samburu Elders, it seems that Samburu and Laikipiak Alasai at one time lived together on d, but as the result of a quarrel the Laikipiak attacked the burn and the latter were driven to El Barta and Nyiro.   One ess, a man of the apparent age of about 60, says this happened re he was born.   When, some years later, the Laikipiak were hilated by the Purko Alasai, it is to be believed that the buru had not returned to Leroki, as they took no part in that From all the evidence and information before us, it is clear the Samburu and Laikipiak Alasai were closely related, in Lenana&apos;s statement tends to show they were actually a part same people. From Air. Bader&apos;s account and other evidence, also apparent that the Njemps, who inhabit the country to the and east of Lake Baringo, are of the same stock.329. How the Samburu came to be in the country they are at Reasons why nt occupying is partly answered above.   After they had been the Sambnrn ted by the Laikipink Masai, they remained in  the distant the present&quot; in the vicinity of Mount Nyiro, Marsabit, and El Barta, and Areas.

Neuri in 1897 found them south of the Uaso Nyiro River near Len&apos;i (the present quarantine reserve near Isiolo), but Mr. Tate ii journey to Rendile in 1902 did not meet them until he re: Beti, much farther tiorth, where they had gone after being r by the Masai and others.880. They appear to have turned south again in 1904, ai L909 their villages were found at Engare Ndare south of the Nyiro. In the same year Captain Stigand found them alonj foothills immediately north of the Leroki Escarpment. In \ Messrs. Hope and Archer, finding some of them across the t Nyiro and in the process of penetrating further southwards, nit them back with the intention of confining them to a recojm and naturally determined frontier. In 1915 they began cros the river again, and for some time the movement escaped notici 831. In the meantime the Turkana had established tk selves along the north bank of the Uaso Nyiro, which the Saml had previously occupied, and it was not until the former had I removed in 1921 that it was possible to push back the latter.832. Prom that time the eastern part of the southern bound of the tribe was regarded as fixed by the natural line of the it but it remained to complete the frontier by delimiting a line to west of that natural boundary. In the same year (1921) Kittermaster submitted a proposal to that end, and demarcate boundary known thereafter as the &quot;Kittermaster Line.&quot; This&apos; gazetted as one of the boundaries of the Northern from  Province in 1924, and the Samburu have since remained in occr tion of the region to the north and east of it, including the Lei Plateau.833. The officer in charge of tin; Northern Frontier Provi had in the meantime advocated a further extension of the Sa-mb country to the south for the purpose of including Sugota Banya1 and the Balagalani River, but the Colonial Secretary, to whom matter was referred, intimated in reply that ample accomtm tion for the Samburu had been provided by the then existing boi ary agreed upon by Messrs Kittermaster, Castle-Smith and Hoi i.e. the &quot;Kittermaster Line&quot;, and withheld his approval.834.

NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TTJRKANA PROVINCES ii_Chapter VI] The Leroki Plateau35. The date of the re-occupation of the Leroki Plateau by sunburn is not certainly known.  According to some accounts, ction of them occupied the area jointly with the Masai before itter were moved to the present Masai. Reserve in 1911/12, t is on record that Mr. Chamier, a former District Commis-er, took tribute of 5,000 head of cattle from the El Masula ion of the Samburu on Leroki in 1911. but the Masai move may begun by that time.   It is possible that the Purko Masai may allowed the Samburu certain grazing facilities on Leroki, but annot believe that they gave them permission to occupy the is a matter of right, or that there was any considerable occupa-while the Masai were there.  It is unlikely that the two tribes on very friendly terms, and the Masai, who no doubt regarded Samburu with supreme contempt, as they do to this day, would inly not have allowed them the use of any grazing wdiich they eel for their own flocks and herds.36. We must conclude, therefore, that the Samburu only to re-occupy the Leroki Plateau after the Masai move had meneed in 1911, but it is clear that they then did so with the tescence of Government officers.837. The sole claim of the Samburu to the Plateau on ical grounds rests upon the fact that they occupied it some ears ago as a section of the Laikipiak Masai or jointly with and we cannot concede, in view of all the circumstances, such a claim can be held to be either valid or conclusive. In days might was right, the Samburu were driven from Leroki te Laikipiak Masai, and were quite incapable of recovering lost territory from them or from the Purko Masai, who sub-ntly occupied the area.38. A census of the people and stock on Leroki in 1928 was by Mr. Bader and his figures are as follows : Samburu. owners n  ...len ...lota.1,027 763 1,681 1,563 1.540si ,57-!Stock.TattleSheep and goatsDonkeysCamelsTotal62,314 49,126 3,318 1S9114,94739. The population figures are not in dispute and of the we need only concern ourselves with the cattle.  At the time census, it was estimated that approximately half the cattle (1 by the tribe were on Leroki, and assuming this to be

Details of other counts and estimates will be fo in the precis, and tend to confirm Mr. Bader&apos;s figures.840. A recent count and estimate has further been made the Veterinary Department. The result is given bv the f Veterinary Officer in his V/l/169 of 29th April, 1933, as follow;.SAMBURU STOCK CENSUS, 1933.Section	Males	Cattle Females	Calves	Sheep	Goats	Donfey.Central	13,560	22,517	5,212	21,000	15.0C0	3.CC0Southern	12,720	21,130	6,0 6	23,333	11,285	2,469Northern	9,694	22,069	6,035	20,503	22,709	4.267	35,994	65,716	17,333	64,836	43,994	9,736Total Cattle .. .. 119,043 ,, Sheep and Goats. . 113,830 ,,   Donkeys  ..       . .     9,736Grand Total, Live Stock    242.609841. In addition to the above it is estimated there were ?uj 10,000 head of cattle in the area to the east of the Matthews Ban: where no census was made, and this would bring the total numl of cattle in the district to 129,043.842. All the above figures include the Turkana cattle on Barta, which are estimated at about 10,000 head, so the numl of cattle owned by the Samburu is approximately 119,000.843. The evidence of the District Commissioner, Rumuni and of European farmers lends to show that the Samburu ma comparatively little use of the Deroki Plateau for their catl particularly of the higher parts, and that fire census of Mr. Bai in 192S is unreliable.S44. Mr. Bamber doubts if there were 6,000 head on Leroki 1930, and Major Luxford and two other gentlemen who made recent independent count, could only find about 2S.000 head thej845. While it must be admitted that the official figure; native-owned cattle are not always very reliable, and that i counting of them, owing to seasonal and other movements, ii difficult matter, we must conclude that Mr. Bader&apos;s census in IS and that of the Veterinary Department in 1932/33, are npprca mately accurate, and indicate the extent to which the Sambif make use of Leroki as a grazing area. That they also use higher region in the north of the plateau is apparent from
NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TTJRKANA PROVINCES II-Chapter VI] The Leroki Plateau420iilence of Mr. Stone, Provincial Commissioner, Northern Frontier vince, and of Mr. Cornell, District Commissioner in charge of I Samburu District. The former states that in June of last year ) he went almost to the northern extremity of Leroki, and saw -e herds of cattle grazing there. We ourselves travelled exten-gely in Leroki and observed little or no superfluous grazing in the la generally, though game and locusts may to a great extent %e accounted for this condition ; we saw few cattle in the high f kales, but considerable numbers in the neighbourhood of Lake lima. We noticed, however, that a great deal of destruction was ftin- caused to the forest by fire and consider that steps should be fen to preserve it.846. It has been contended that the Samburu, from the name letimes applied  to  them &quot;Loibor Ivenejie&quot;   (of  the  White fats), corrupted by the early  travellers into  &quot;Purkenejie&quot;  or iurkenejie&quot; were   not   originally   a  cattle-owning   tribe,   but Jioagh Government protection has doubtless enabled them largely increase their herds of recent years, it is clear from Von Hohnehs k that they possessed large numbers of cattle as far back as 17, when Count  Teleki met  them on his journey to Lake idolf.   The names of two of the main clans also indicate that ly have always been cattle owners.847. The plateau may be said to comprise roughly all the high Character of id between the so-called Kittermaster and Coryndon lines.   The the Leroki iitiota of this latter is uncertain, but appears to follow the foot- 1,Iatoau-; of the escarpment to the north.   The survey figures of the a give it as 870 square miles, of which only 300 square miles are to be suitable for European settlement, and 130 square miles forest.   We have not been able to obtain a description of the training area of 440 square miles, but it is believed to consist jely of barren, precipitous, lava hills of little value for stock or jiculture.   A more  detailed  account  of the character of the [teatt will be found in the precis.84S. Europeans consider the Leroki Plateau or part of it, to [suitable for cattle and mixed farming, but more particularly for Sep.

Mr. McCon: was of opinion that the provision of additional.water supplies woi be of little value, and would, in fact, tend to accentuate the ov stocking evil. Mr. Hodge and Mr. Langridge considered the o struction of three or four dams would be beneficial, but would materially add to the available grazing.850.

Mr. Alexander Armstrong sta in his evidence that the Land Office informed him in 1910 that t Masai were being removed from Laikipia in order to make roc for white settlement, and we think there is little doubt that Eis peans generally were under that impression.S59. This impression was probably reinforced by a letter w&apos;. was sent out from the Land Office in June, 1909 (L.O. File li: part 3) inviting Europeans who had land or claims to land in Southern Uaso Nyiro area to surrender such land rights in exchac for alternative land &quot;within the present Northern Masai or its vicinity.&quot;800. In  reply  to a question in Parliament  by Sir Bob; Hamilton  in   1926,  the  Secretary of  State  intimated tha Governor  had represented  that  the area  concerned  had net properly been Samburu country, but had been intended for Ei pean settlement by the Alasai under the 1911 Agreement.S61. On 1st November, 1927, His Excellency the Govern received a deputation of the elected members of Legislative Count The late Lord Delamere said that, having known Sir Doe Stewart very well indeed and having had many conversations wi him on this and other subjects, there had never been any doi whatever in his mind, nor had anything occurreel to create sncl doubt, as to the fact that the land was definitely vacated for I purpose of European settlement. Air. 0&apos;Shea corroborated t view, having taken part in the transaction relating to the surrender of some of the farms (i.e. those surrendered when the South Masai Eeserve was enlarged).
422862. On the other hand the motive which actuated the Masai onsenting to move is recorded in the preamble to the Agreement 911 to have been &quot;That it is in the best interests of their tribe the Alasai should inhabit one area.&quot; In contrast to the nnble to the 1(.)04 Agreement, no allusion was made to white lenient.863. The Secretary of State, in a despatch dated the 30th 1925, and again in a despatch in July, 1929, repudiated any gestion that there had ever been any understanding or under-im that Leroki would be made available for European settle-t.864. Although the Samburu.were in occupation of Leroki in or soon after, the question of European claims to it wouldappear to have been pressed until 13 years later, when the lateBerkely Cole, in a letter dated the 17th Alay, 1924, addressed he Colonial Secretary, contended that the Alasai would not haveed as peaceably as they did if they had thought they were ing the land to the Samburu instead of making it available for te settlement.865.

It is also not clear what is meant by theoki Mountains; and the Chief Native Commissioner considersfirst line of the escarpment to the south, approximately whereKittermaster Line now is, was intended.   If he is correct&apos; inopinion, the greater part of the Leroki Plateau is excluded the reserve intended in the Agreement, but others think the e of mountains in the northern extremity of the Plateau would e accurately describe the Leroki Mountains, and we are inclined gree with them. By proclamation in 1906 that reserve was extended to the north and east by purely geographical lines whichhown on the map as the boundaries of the old Alasai Reserve.object of this large extension to the agreement boundaries is clear, and it is probable that it was intended to be of a pro-nal character only.  The Alasai made no use of it to the north,r as is known, and the Samburu were certainly in occupation by 1909, when Captain Stigand found them on the foothillse escarpment.  This area is also claimed as being available forpean settlement on the grounds that it was part of the old ai Reserve, though it could not well be described as &quot;Whitelands.&quot;NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURKANA PROVINCES II Chapter VI] The Leroki Plateau

It does not seem probable that Government could regarded the dry country and barren wastes to the north as si for white occupation, or ever intended it for that purpose Masai did not make use of it and it was inhabited by other Unfortunately the boundaries of the Masai Reserve are so and ill-deimed in the Agreement that it is impossible to say area they comprised.   It is probable that the area included of the Leroki Plateau, but we consider Government, in fixiii &quot;Kittermaster Line&quot; as the limit of native occupation and a h ary of the Northern Frontier Province, effected a fair and able compromise; it left available for alienation all but i portion of what could have been Masai country under the tei the Agreement which was suitable for Europeans.867. The question of the Samburu claim to Leroki ha? discussed in sections 823-837 above, and we agree that on his grounds their claim is not a very strong one. Whatever claim may have had dates back before the time of European admi tion. However logical it might seem to say to the Samburu, did not occupy this land when we came, but you did occupy 1 bit, and therefore you must go back there,&quot; such a course wo impossible, because that area is now occupied by other tribe no Government would contemplate the continual moving of for such reasons.868. On economic grounds, we agree generally7 that Euro] would be able to use the land to better advantage than the 1 in their present state of development, but Leroki is son: remote for mixed farming, and if surveyed for sheep far seems to be contemplated, the area would in the early d; settlement suffice only for 20 farms at the most. Under occupation it can and does support some 6,000 Africans with flocks and herds, and the Samburu do sell considerable numt sheep ; the District has been long in quarantine for cattle.869. We do not feel we can support an argument that b one community is able to make better use of land th.au an the former must necessarily have it, however essential it rr for the latter.870. Major Tyndall has supplied information r surveyed unalienated farms in Laikipia and there is a further area south of the Kittermaster Line which tinder our reconim tion will be available for Europeans; the addition thereft
423NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURK ANA PROVINCES il-Chai-ter VI] The Leroki PlateauI 21)0,000 acres on Leroki is not likely materially to affect tin; omic situation.$71. The question of the use made of Lcroki lor grazing pur-s by the Samburu has been discussed under the heading of ilation and stock, and there is little to add.  We must assume at least 50,000 bead of cattle are generally grazing on Leroki ddition to large numbers of sheep, goats and donkeys, and from forest and the precipitous lava country to the north and the area available for grazing is limited to about 200,000 which is approximately four acres to a beast.   It cannot, fore, be said to be understocked.s72. The character of the land occupied by the Samburu, apart Leroki, has been examined above. As the views expressed been   so   widely   divergent   regarding   the   suitability   anduacy of the area for the whole of the Samburu tribe, we con-vd that the question required very careful investigation, andonunend a study of the reports and evidence of Messrs Hodge.gridge and McConnel. who were especially detailed to make aiplete an examination of the country as possible. Their views in the main supported by all administrative and military is who have been in charge of the Samburu or Northern tier Province, who, without exception, considered that Leroki essential to the needs of the Samburu: some of them, in fact,lgly advocated a further addition of land to the south of theermaster Line.873. We consider the opinions and views of these officers must ail over those of travellers, sportsmen and others, who merely t&apos;d through the country and whose knowledge of it was slight, who possibly saw it under unusually favourable conditions, ongh there may be a good growth of grass after rain for a t period, the nature of the soil will not support it for any h of time and it soon withers and dies.S74. Government has very fully investigated the possibility of &quot;g alternative land for Leroki, and in view of the evidence reports which we have received we are convinced that there o alternative areas which would provide an adequate or suit-exchange. In any case it should be mentioned that the whole e Isiolo quarantine would not have been available, and it is able that some of the land suggested will in the near future be eel for other purposes.375. The question of the present and prospective needs of the mru as regards grazing has been discussed from several points iw in the foregoing parts of this chapter, but there are some t aspects that require examination.(e) That the Saniburu  have so Hieient hind without Leroki.Conclusion regarding Alternative Areas.Other aspects of the Samburu Question.

It has been urged that a section of the Turkanaoccupy part of what is recognized as Saniburu country, have right or reason to be there, and should be removed. The histon these Turkana is briefly as follows : 877. During the period of the war they penetrated to the nc bank of the Uaso JSyiro and forced the Samburu to the soutf that river. In July, 1919, Sir Edward Northey directed as foiloi &quot;Steps must be taken to warn the Samburu at once that they not be allowed to keep their stock south of the Uaso Nyiro on no account must they be allowed to build villages.  As soon we have driven, as we must do, the Turkana invaders bad their own country, tell the Saniburu that the last named will forcibly ejected from the south of the river.   Limits must be on the nomadic tribes.&quot;878. An account of the actions taken and of the reason.; allowing them to return and occupy that part of the Samburu ;jr ing grounds known as El Barta will be found in the precis. T have remained in the Samburu District ever since, and appear have encroached beyond the El Barta Plains.879. There is reason to believe the Turkana have a claim the area known as the El Barta Blains, for Captain Stigand for them there 21 years ago, and it would entail considerable hard-on them to move them into the Sugota valley or the Turk country.  We have, in other parts of our Report, visualized in penetration by tribes as being generally desirable as a remedy maldistribution, and we recommend that the Turkana be allo to remain in the district, but we consider their movements be more strictly controlled than is apparently the case at presen (6) Tsetse Fly.        880. There is no doubt from the evidence that large area the Samburu country are &quot;fly&quot; infested, but it has been st; that the cattle of the tribe are, to some extent at least, immun &quot;fly&quot;.   We would hesitate to express any opinion on this la point, and it seems probable that there are different varietie &quot;fly&quot;  with different degrees of virulence.   We have it on authority of Mr. Bader that during times of drought the Sam are forced to graze part of their stock in fly-infested areas, and their losses from trypanosomiasis are considerable.   We con? fly-infestation is a serious factor in diminishing the grazing vain the Saniburu country.(c) Game. 881. The whole of the Samburu country, including Lerok&quot;Game Reserve&quot;, but we understand it is proposed to exclude latter area.   The effect of game on the grazing and water sn: &apos; is probably not verv serious, and that is the opinion of the 0Warden, Captain Ritchie.

Bitchie&apos;s desire for a ational Park&quot; in that area, we consider the Samburu are itled to some consideration in respect of it.882. We consider the figure of 120,000 represents approxi-tely the number of cattle owned by the Samburu, and they have o iar&quot;e numbers ot sheep and goats.  On the basis that the popu-ion is 12,000 it follows that they have 10 head of cattle per ividual and they must be considered to be a wealthy tribe in this beet.   It has been argued that they do not need so large an ount of stock for their support, and that the numbers might be siderably reduced with advantage to themselves, and the country y occupy. We agree with the view that the Samburu would be ter off, and that their country would benefit if large numbers of ir uneconomic beasts were disposed of, but even if their cattle e reduced by 30 per cent or 40 per cent, Leroki or some other zinn&apos; area would still be necessary for them on economic grounds; y could not all be pastured in the area, apart from Leroki, with-seriottsly increasing the overstocking position which already ts.  In Mr. Bader&apos;s opinion the Samburu in 1930 had no more k than was necessary for their requirements under present con-ons and there is no evidence to show that they have materially eased, if at all, since that time, but he agrees that they would better off with fewer and better cattle; and we consider that sures   to   reduce   the   numbers   of   uneconomic   beasts  are essary.8S3. The whole position and our recommendations may be Summary fly summarized as under : Historical Claims.(1) The claim of the Samburu to Leroki on historical grounds s upon the fact that they occupied the area as a part of or t!y with the Laikipiak Masai some GO or more years ago, and rned thereto with the tacit consent of the Government about year 1911.(2) That their former grazing grounds in the neighbourhood larsabit mountain, to which they went after their defeat by Laikipiak, are no longer available for them.They have, in our opinion, only a slight claim to Leroki on above grounds, and if this were the only reason for granting them we should not consider it sufficient.Claims of Europeans.(1) While we appreciate the fact that there was a general ensus of opinion among Europeans that the Masai were re-d from Laikipia in order to provide land for European settle-t in that area, and we think that that was also intended by
NORTHERN FRONTIER AND TURK ANA PROVINCESGovernment at the Lime, we cannot accept the contention thai i whole of the old Masai Reserve as defined in the Agreement or Proclamation . .  . was definitely set aside for that purpose.(2) We are unable to recommend that the Samburu should removed from Leroki and the land be leased to European.- sol, because the latter might be able to use it to better econoii advantage in the future.(3) We find that Leroki is extensively used by the San for grazing, and that they normally keep about half their cat there.(4) We consider that the Samburu country as apart n, Leroki is incapable of supporting more cattle than now make i. of it, and is, in fact, already seriously overstocked.(5) We agree with the conclusion of the 1930 committee tl the suggested alternative areas are insufficient to accommodate Samburu stock which is grazed on Leroki.(a) That the &quot;Kittermaster Line&quot;  be kept as one of tboundaries of the Northern Frontier Province subject any minor adjustments which Government may const! necessary, and that all the land to the north and east it, including the Leroki Plateau, be reserved for nati use and occupation for such a time as may be necessa We do not at present recommend that the area declared native reserve for reasons which we state Chapter V ou the subject of the Northern Front Province generally.(b) That the boundary be demarcated in such a manner t!there can be no mistake as to its whereabouts.(c) That the forest area on Leroki be demarcated and decla.to be Government Forest Reserve.(d) That no leases to non-natives should be allowed on Leiexcept for such purposes as are of direct benefit to t natives (e.g. a creamery with a reasonable amount land for grazing purposes), provided that plots for p poses of administration, trading, or social service slio be allowed, and also small plots for residential purpose  not exceeding fifty acres.(e) That such area to the north and east of the Coryndon Las Government considers necessary, should, subject adequate protection of native rights and interests, be aside as a &quot;National Park&quot; under the supervision of Game Department.Part II Chapter VI]Protection of Native kiiieRecommenda-tions.884.

In the following paragraphs in which er a short- account of the economic position of the West Suk ave relied principally on the figures which he has supplied.are, however, two discrepancies between his figures and 1 figures which it is necessary to explain :  Ir, Hyde Clarke has estimated the area of his district as square miles: the Surveyor General&apos;s figures are 1,812 square for the native reserve. But the figures are to a large extent filed by the fact that certain land to the north and west of wain river, approximately 1,315 square miles in extent, is

In the course of 1932 some thousand of the population migrated to Uganda, hut it does ii appear whether the move is permanent or not, and for the pi of appraising the economic situation it is safer to work on the&apos; of the 1931 figures.These points being noted, we find Mr. Hyde Clarke&apos;s ii to be sufficiently accurate to afford a broad survey of the positiiS89.

The total live stock in the Northern Hills is estimated by istrict Commissioner at 74,000 cattle, 95,000 sheep and goats 500 donkeys. This gives an average of 68 cattle, 88 sheep ats and 5 donkeys for each household of five persons. This is btedly a great many more than are necessary for the support natives as pastoralists.3. The Southern Hills, approximately 400 square miles in comprise the Sondange and part of the Cherangani ranges.4.

No in-ion is available as to the extent of agriculture, but the District commissioner estimates the stock as follows : 30,000 cattle, 60,000 and goats and 700 donkeys. There are open spaces of grass-alternating with dense forest or bush, while the rainfall is constant in the region of 40 inches per annum.5. In the opinion of the District Commissioner, this area be made much more useful by the provision of veterinary s which should be directed to destocking and improving the of the stock and to the proper utilization of the pasture, ilture should be strongly encouraged in this part of the t.6. The number of stock owned by the pastoralists per house-3 approximately 48 head of cattle and 96 sheep and goats, gain must be regarded as considerably more than necessary eir economic requirements.7.

If we take as a basis that the average number of-:&quot;&apos;thePPa^turet0 necessary for the support of a pastoral family is twenty, fl although opinions differ, is a high figure, it follows that in all divisions of Suk the natives own several times more stock thai essential for their needs. We will now turn to consideratione available grazing in order that we may discover whether the ps is sufficient to carry the stock.903. Leaving sheep and goats out of consideration foi moment, we find the number of acres available per head oft is as follows :  Acreage per head oj Cattle Northern Hills      ...      ...      12 approximatelySouthern Hills      ......

When we take into consideration the facts : (1) thai of the stock belonging to the inhabitants of the Northern graze on the Eastern and Western Plains; (2) that large are) the country are unsuitable for grazing at all, and (3) that i goats and donkeys in very large numbers also use the pasture, cannot avoid the conclusion that the district is grossly overstoci not only far beyond the carrying capacity of the land, but als beyond the essential needs of the people.   The evidence of District Commissioner and our own observations during our through  the   district   show  that  the country  is  rapidly 1 destroyed, and dense thorn scrub is replacing- grassy plains.905.

These recommendations should be read in conjunction the more general survey on the subject of overstocking which iffer in Chapter X of the third part of our Report. \rote 2. We have also recommended the inclusion of the West in one reserve with other tribes (see sections 1028 and 1029&amp;07.

A proposal put forward for our consideration is the an adjustment of the inter-colonial boundary, the district Turkana and West Suk in Kenya and Karamoja in Uganda &amp; be included under one administration.910. Two reasons have been urged in favour of the propos(a) As divided by the official boundary, Kenya has moreits share of permanent water, while Uganda has -I superfluous grazing.

This agreement was reached bet of constant trespiass by the Suk over the official boundary consequent friction with the Karamojong.912. In our opinion this proposal, as involving an alterati a colonial boundary, is outside our terms of reference and we no recommendation, beyond remarking that, in the circuinsta it apjiears to merit serious consideration.   The matter is one mutual arrangement between the Governments concerned ana Secretary of State for the Colonies.   We have, however requested by His Kxcllency the Governor of Kenya Colony to careful consideration to the economic requirements of the Su order that the Kenya and Uganda Governments may b possession of the facts.913. The foregoing pages show, in our opinion, irrefn that the West Suk Beserve is very heavily overstocked, and is little doubt that, should it be decided to adhere to the boundary, economic pressure will continue to drive the&apos;Su trespass over the border, unless the numbers of their stock are considerably reduced.

They were defeated in battle by other Alasai [the tribe was almost destroyed, except for a few scattered fiants. Some of these remnants eventually went to the Ravine, \ to Nandi and others to Kitosh in North Kavirondo. Those ed in the Ravine rendered considerable assistance to Govern-in the early days of administration and acquired a certain nt of wealth.   .917. In 1904, when large tracts of land in the Ravine District being alienated to European settlers, the then District Com-oner advised Government that great injustice was being done e Uasin Gishu Masai. The Land Officer thereupon reserved the land available some 9,000 acres.

We consider that they will be far r off along with the main body of their own tribe, and we imend that they be moved by Government order.)24. Although we shall review the claims of the Pokwot, ips, and Kamasia Native Reserves separately, we have come e conclusion on the general grounds which will be explained in III of our Report that it is in the best interests of all these that they should be  combined  together in one reserve, igb such combination would be without prejudice to any e rights of groups, families, or individuals and tribal rights be adequately safeguarded (sections 1446, 1796 and Chapters o VI of Part III passim).

We believe that these arrangements will be in conformity the wishes of the natives.   We were told in baraza by their sentatives that they did not desire rigid adherence to inter-boundaries, but would prefer a certain amount of inter-ation and reciprocal grazing arrangements for their mutual subject of course, to control by the Administration.   We full agreement and suggest that such interpenetration should e all possible encouragement.26. These proposals will be further expanded in a later pas-below (sections 1028 and 1029).27. We shall now examine the case of the East Suk or ot, as they are generally called. They lay claim to Churo, an of approximately 127 square miles on the Laikipia Escarp-The claim is based on grounds of recent occupation, mic necessity and present possession.28.

Mood, Assistant District commissioner, in a memorandum written in 1925 said : &quot;Tax was collected from Pokwot (Suk) residents of huro from 1902-1909 in kind and from 1910-1924 in cash. It ill therefore be seen that the Pokwot occupation of Churo has een permanent and continuous since the administration of the istrict from Baringo.&quot;The Pokwot Claim to Churo.
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE Part II Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommkxdj-LjjJLI929. On page 408 of Joseph Thomson&apos;s book &quot;Through H land&quot; we read in reference to the year 1884 : &quot;The greater part of Laikipia and that the ri portion is quite uninhabited, owing, in a degree, to decimation of the Masai of that part, through their intern; wars a fact that has caused them to retreat from the nortl districts, which are in dangerous proximity to the Wa-suk930. As against this Von Holmel recounts (Teleki, Vol. p. 56, the year being 1888) : -&quot;This neighbourhood, as well as that passed through day before, was quite uninhabited, and bore the name oT Lol Borngishu, or the &quot;Spring of the &quot;White Oxen.&quot;931. We have it in evidence that Lare Lol Borngishu j; same as Churo.932. Mr. C. H. Adams, who was District Commission! Laikipia in 1909-1910, states : &quot;Churo was occupied by Masai and not by Suk, wh was in Laikipia.   There was friendly contact with other t on the very edge of the Laikipia Plateau, because the II Masai were a very orderly and disciplined people; they rich and wanted only to avoid trouble with Government, 933. Mr. E. B. Plosking, who was District Commissioiii 1916-1918, states that he had never heard of Churo at all, whii curious, if the Bokwot made as much use of it as they say did or if tax was collected from them in cash from 1910-19ilk! stated above by Mr. Mood.934. The only conclusion which, in our view, can be jus; on the evidence is that the Pokwot have used the region for ai siderable time, at least on occasions, as a reserve of grazing in t; of drought. They cannot therefore be said to have a com claim to it, although they have undoubtedly been permitte occupy it for many years.(2) The 935. We must  now  examine  the  matter in the ligliiBasfs0mlG economic needs.   The estimated number of live stock whichPokwot possess is 100,000 cattle and 275,000 sheep and goat: average allowance of 68 cattle and 187 sheep and goats to a farj of five, which is greatly in excess of their requirements. The: no adequate market in which they could dispose of the sur even were they not prevented by quarantine regulations, have now been in force for a number of years; and even if si: market existed, their degenerate stock is of very little mar] value.  It will therefore be seen that the cattle which is surplu their requirements is of very little use to them in present co: tions, while it is ruining the land.9L feat; :ocke 192si&apos;9: far Jnorrr.e -A ake later tarvs [lroug 10,00: giep Itesei &quot;pe m resi but i: ;educt seou
KENYA LAND COMMISSION KEPOET351-    431THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE ji_Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommendations936. Beyond question the country is unable to support so t a number of live stock. The reserve in addition to being over-bked is very ill-watered. The Provincial Commissioner wrote 1929 :-&quot;The plain fact must be faced that human life cannot be supported in the Pokwot Native Reserve as it is now situated.&quot; 937. We consider that this is an overstatement, and that in [far as the Pokwot have a poor standard of life it is due to the Brmous numbers of stock, far in excess of their needs, which By have been allowed to accumulate.  It is on record that in 1925 Assistant District Commissioner found the country between i Baringo, Churo, and Nginyawo  &quot;devoid of grazing and er, and covered with the &quot;bones of cattle which had died of yation&quot; ; and it has been stated in evidence that during times of ght the need for water is so great that sometimes as many as [000 head of Pokwot cattle crowd into Churo, which is outside present boundaries of the reserve.938. It would therefore appear that an extension of the Pokwot ;reserve is advisable, in order that additional watering facilities may made available for the use of the natives and in order to provide Jjserve of grazing to enable a reconditioning scheme to be carried in the existing reserve. At the same time a very considerable iction in the number of their stock is necessary.939. After hearing the evidence, including that of Air. Ff. E. Recommeada,-llby, the Acting Provincial Commissioner (Evidence, p. 1910, [teg.) we recommend :  (1) That Churo be gazetted as Native Reserve, Class B 2.  (See section 23 above.)(2) That the grant should be subject to conditions of utiliza-tion and control, aud, in particular, that, where there is no well-defined natural boundary, a fence should be erected to prevent trespass by the Pokwrot in the direction of the Laikipia settled area.(3) That rents or grazing fees should be paid, to form the nucleus of a fund for reconditioning the reserve, and to pay the cost of constructing and maintaining the fence.(-1) That the area so added be approximately 130-150 square miles, but for the purposes of the schedules which follow section 1510 below the area is taken at 140 square miles.INote. We consider that the precise determination of the idaries should be left to Government without any particular imnendation  on  our part;  but we think that the District
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE Part II Chapter VIII] Problems and RecommendCouncil concerned should be consulted as well as the natives, various suggestions which have been made appear at pp. 1770, 1833; 1911, 1924 and 1925 of the Evidence.The Njemps. 940. We now come to the Njemps Eeserve.  The figures-that an.average household of five persons has 405 acres availal it and possesses 27 head of cattle and 60 sheep or goats allowance of pasture working out at fifteen acres per hea cattle. At first sight therefore it would appear that very gen provision has been made for the Njemps. But, like other t they have persistently overstocked their laud, with the result grave deterioration has set in. The District Commiss writes : &quot;Most of their present country is very barren and i cally no grass is to be seen in the low-lying areas, thoug fiats around the Lake could easily produce good grazi given a chance. There is an almost total lack of grazing able for cattle, and, if any improvement schemes at succeed, it is essential to rest the areas during the peri reconditioning.&apos;&apos;941. An area of some 78 square miles to the east of the pr Njemps Native Reserve toward Ngelesha is claimed by the both on historical grounds and on grounds of economic needs agreement was reached in 1921 between the Commissioner of 1 and the Chief Native Commissioner that the area should be for added to the reserve.   The Brovincial Commissioner at the on the strength of this agreement, informed the Njemps accordingly.   The area was not however, included in the re as gazetted in 1926, the Chief Native Commissioner furnishin following explanation : &quot;The reason is that it is not considered that the should be added to the native reserve until the formality publication of the details for public criticism had been t taken.  A schedule of such areas is now being prepared 1 Land Office and will, it is hoped, shortly be published, which, provided no insurmountable public objection is recei final notice will be gazetted including these areas in reserves.&quot;942. The natives have claimed the area; their claim has admitted by Government, and they were officially informed s years ago that they would be granted the land. We recom that it should be granted to them as Native Reserve, Class B943. We consider that with the extension above recommend the Njemps will have all the facilities wliich they can justly either on historical or economic grounds, and although we
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE jj_Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommendationsct propose a further extension of the reserve in this neighbour-the use of it is not intended primarily for the Njemps, but he Kamasia.   We shall revert to this subject in section 96944. We take this opportunity of stating explicitly that in our there is no obligation either moral or otherwise upon Govern-to provide unlimited grazing for stock owners of any race, and he practical remedy for overstocking does not lie in limitless sions, but rather in the provision of outlets, the culling of nomic stock, and strict control of the pasture available. 45. The Kamasia lay claim to the southern part of the forest The Kami e known as the Grogan Concession, and all the forest as far ^1&quot;ims. as Kilombe hill, from there south to the Molo river, crossing Historical aver at or about the Lower Molo trading centre, and thence Basis, lai and thence northwards including the strip of Crown and ted land.46. The evidence before us proves definitely that in the early the Kamasia did not live on the east of the Molo river for f the Masai.  The following extracts may be quoted : Mr. F. W. Baillie : &quot;When in May, 1904, I shot over the ountry it was comparatively well grassed country, and the nly cattle grazing were Masai cattle, who moved, according to he time of year, into the hills on the east.&quot;Mr. D. Faiccus : &quot;In 1906 there were no Kamasia at all nywhere east of the Molo River. The piece of country east of le Molo river and south of Lake Hannington was not ermanently inhabited by any natives, but was definitely oked upon by the Masai as their country, and was spas-odically occupied by them, particularly in wet cold weather, hen they came down from the Laikipia Escarpment.&quot;Marian Ahamcd (a Swahili who served with Lugard) : The Kamasia were at that time in the hills. They did not down into the plains, where there was grass, because they ere afraid of the Masai.&quot;7. We therefore find as a fact that, until they were granted e of it by Government, the Kamasia had no claim to the hich they now occupy east of the Molo River.8. So far as the claim to the Grogan concession area is ned, the general question of native rights in this area was object of inquiry by Mr. E. W. Isaac, Provincial Commis-in 1923. We shall have occasion to mention this inquiry our discussion of the claims made by natives of the Elgeyo Mr. Isaac found, as a fact, that certain Kamasia had rights Lembus forest. These rights were denned, and the names
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE Part II-Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommend.m.of the right-holders mentioned in a formal instrument signed i Governor, and under the terms of Major Grogan&apos;s licence no fi rights can he obtained pending the expiry of the concession.949. In the opinion of the District Commissioner the Kau claim to the farms adjoining Ravine, including the Uasin G areas and the block of farms between the Eldama and Kara; rivers, is in all probability valid, but the Provincial Commit;; stated in his memorandum: &quot;It is extremely doubtful if Kamasia formerly occupied as large an area in the south as; do now. Before the arrival of the white man and settled Got ment, the Masai over-ran the greater part of any of the p; suitable for cattle and sheepi. Any other tribes in the vicinit Nakuru must have kept mainly to the hills and come dowu to plains only when the Alasai did not need them.&quot; This opinion. consonance with the other evidence cited above, which shows the Kamasia did not occupy any land to the east of the )] and, in our opinion, any land which they. may have lost to west of that river is more than compensated by the additional which they now use. Tt cannot therefore be said that they! any claim of right to an extension of their reserves.950. We shall now examine whether they have any e based on economic needs.(2) The 951. The Northern Kamasia are relatively poor in cattle.Baskf11110 m8&apos;* if the figures are to be trusted, approximately five cattle household; on the other hand they are well supplied with i and goats, the average per household being estimated as fifty, number of acres available per household appears to be 141, much of the land is rocky and precipitous. According to the t ence adduced the country is capable of some agricultural devi ment. We do not consider that the position calls for any sp action.952. The case of the Southern Kamasia is more difficult deserves a more detailed analysis.953. The figure already given for the population in sec 914 above is stated by the District Commissioner to includ number of Kamasia who are living as squatters on alienated It is therefore probable that the density of the reserve, shov twenty to a square mile, is in reality somewhat less.954. The people themselves are inclined to be pastoral ra than agricultural. From the District Commissioners estimate, average number of live stock owned by a family of five is app mately 12 head of cattle and 46 sheep and goats.
THE MET VALLEY PROVINCE II Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommendations955. The acreage available per head of cattle is approximately e, which would clearly be ample were the country in good ition, but, as the evidence shows, so deplorable has the state e country become that it is entirely inadequate. The reasons his melancholy condition we shall discuss below, but we have to describe it.56. The following is an extract from a memorandum written 28 by the Provincial Commissioner : -&quot;The hills are volcanic and carry but little soil; at the ime of my visit to the area on 17th-20th May, after good rains ad fallen, there was practically no grass either on the plains r in the hills. After the rainpools have dried, there is no -ater of any sort between Solai and the river Molo, a distance f some 18 miles. In the district which we are discussing teep rocky escarpments have to be climbed, over which the -eakened cattle can scarcely stagger and often die in doing-o.&quot; &apos;:: &apos; . .57. The Provincial Commissioner supported his statement by ng various opinions recorded on his files. The following xcerpts : r in Charge, Kerio Province, to Chief Native Commissioner, 3-9-24 :&quot;The Kamasia Reserve is very short of grazing and in lany parts incapable of producing it, as I can vouch from ersonal observation.&quot;Inspector to Senior Veterinary Officer, Nakuru, 2-6-25 :&quot;Prom my observation of the condition in Kamasia reserve over quite a large area, I can only state that so far s grazing for cattle is concerned this is non-existent.&quot;A.

My reasons for this application are : t is impossible to keep the Kamasia from trespassing.

In consequence of this memorandum an Agric Officer was sent to examine the district in 1929, and ex) agreement with the description given by the -Provincial Cc sioner, and made various recommendations.059. Since then, two successful bore-holes have been but the pumping facilities are in our opinion entirely inai and should be improved.

He has do: celient work, but has been severely handicapped by lack of We are of opinion that the vote for this work should be consid increased.960. There is some difference of opinion as to how the f condition of the reserve came about. The view generally 1-European farmers living in the vicinity is that over-stocking chief cause, a view which is supported by Mr. Langridge, \vl that he considers the damage to be due to goats, rathei cattle. This opinion is not held by the Rev. E. B. Dal; missionary who has lived in the reserve since 1919. He attr the denudation of the land to a sudden meteorological c shortly before he arrived, and in support of his opinion state he fenced in a piece of land, which he kept lightly stockec from bearing grass two feet high it became a barren patch oi961. We have called for the rainfall records for Sols Kabarnet and also for Nakuru, a neighbouring area and one largest maize producing districts in the Colony. They are s in Appendix No. 10. They certainly do not support Mr. I in his conclusion, but it is interesting to note that he arriv Kenya soon after 1916 and 1917, which were two exceptional! years, which may perhaps account for the impression lie received.962. Our conclusion on the matter is that over-st (especially by goats) aggravated by the locust infestation durir past five years is mainly responsible for the present situatioi any case it is unquestionable that, economically speaking reserve in its present condition is adequate neither for the p: nor for the future needs of the Kamasia, and determined elfor needed to recondition it.

The remedy appears to lie  in  three directions :  Im-[ate culling ol stock which would effect an appreciable and [lv reduction of numbers ; secondly, that goats should be re-to certain areas; thirdly, some other area must be found reserve for grazing to enable portions of the land to be rested reconditioned, and to simplify the task of the Administration eping hungry stock from the areas which are being rested, and encroaching on to neighbouring farms.Efi4. The reserve is not beyond hope of regeneration, and 1 ultimately be able, if adequate measures are taken, to carry my or even more cattle than it does now and of a better ty.   The natives will gain correspondingly in meat and milk;1955. It now remains to find the necessary extension areas, fve have five recommendations to make in this connexion which have the effect of increasing the facilities available to the isia by some 122 square miles, of which 23 square miles would temporary facility secured by lease, while the rest would be (1 to the reserve.[966. These recommendations are made in the confidence that Tiiment will devise and apply energetically a scheme of recon-ining to the Kamasia Reserve. If this is done, the extensions he of great service in allowing the stock to be removed from uled land while reconditioning takes place. But, if no such are taken. the addition of extra land will only add to the of devastion and complicate the problem. It is impossible to Iterate the urgency of the need for a comprehensive and active jimiie for staying the destruction and improving the reserve.87. We recommend that the land to be evacuated by the Gishu Masai be added to the Native Reserve as Class B 1, le. use of the Kamasia, except that Eldalat hill, an area of Iximately five square miles containing valuable cedar, should otected as a forest reserve.

Our object in making the recommenc is that more land should be available for the use of the Kan But if it is found more convenient for the Njemps to occupy land and vacate other land in favour of the Kamasia there s1 be no objection to any mutually satisfactory arrangement may be reached by the Provincial Commissioner.970. Ij.0. 1168 (920 acres) has been set aside as a sa and grazing area for the Kamasia, and fenced in order to pre trespass by native stock on adjoining farms. It provides acce Lake Solai. This area was originally set aside on the recommend tion of Mr. Lynn Watt, Agricultural Officer, who made a si; of the reserve in 1929. It is desirable that this access shod made secure to the Kamasia, and we therefore recommend this area be gazetted Native Reserve, Class A.971. There is a piece of land approximately 960 acre extent to the east of the Lembus forest. It was marked on plans as forest reserve, but has never been gazetted as sncl is in fact treeless and therefore not required by the Forest De ment.  It is in occupation by the Kamasia and we recommend it be added as Native Reserve, Class A.972. The Dorobo are, of course, not confined to the Itift V Province, and it is only the Mau section which need concer here.   We deal with the other sections under their appro provinces.
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE H_Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommendations973. The passing of the game and forest laws interfered the primitive mode of life led by the Dorobo, and efforts have made by the Administration with varying success to induce to become useful members of native society.  They have been uraged to acquire stock and to cultivate, but unfortunately no has been reserved for their use.  They live, for the most part, rest reserves, but exception is taken by the Conservator of ts to the presence of native-owned stock in areas under his ol.  On the other hand, under present conditions they cannot be expected to continue to live in the forests without stock.74. Thus they present a definite problem.  Government, hav-ncouraged them to abandon their primitive pursuits, should specific provision for then land requirements.75. It must be stated that Government has been fully aliveresponsibilities; a committee was formed in 1929 to consider future of these people. This committee reported in July, 1931, s it was considered that the subject came within our terms of ence, it was decided neither to publish nor to implement the t pending the action taken on our Deport.76. We have read the report of this committee, which stands klence, and are in general agreement with its recommendations, feel that action should be taken without delay because the em will certainly become more difficult the longer action isned.  The number of Dorobo-owned stock is definitely on these.77. The evidence and memoranda which have been submitted , and the various official documents to which we have had show that a considerable number of the Dorobo are con-, in a greater or less degree, with various tribes in the - which have native reserves allotted to their use, and the 1 recommendation of the Dorobo committee is that such s should be moved to the reserves of the tribes to which they liated. We are in full agreement with this rcommendation. 8. When the Dorobo committee report was drafted, the Man The Ma of the Dorobo amounted in all to some 379 persons owning Section, head of cattle.  The evidence before us shows that the num-f people have slightly, and the numbers of cattle have erably, increased since that time. A number of these Dorobo liated with the Nandi, the Lumbwa, and the Masai, and mittee have recommended that any who cannot be absorbed ese tribes should be moved to the Chepalungu forest area, south-east of South Lumbwa District.
THE RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE Part II Chapter VIII] Problems and Recommend979. We are in general agreement with this recommend; but we are of opinion that, in so far as is possible, the D should be consulted as to whether they would prefer to c Chepalungu or into another native reserve.980. We agree with the committee that the Dorobo are likely to progress and become useful citizens if they live si-side,  with  communities  who  have already advanced some along the road of orderly progress, and for this reason, ai. others, we do not recommend that any part of Chepalungu sli be gazetted a special Dorobo Eeserve, but that it should be * to the Lumbwa Native Eeserve, and we consider that any be: who may be moved to Chepalungu should be given every oi tunity of mingling with the Lumbwa not so much with the o of ultimate absorption in view, but rather that they may lear example gradually to take an active part in the affairs of the disi981. We do not see how- any move of the Dorobo can eqtiii be carried out without some expense to Government. Many of i have good claims of right to the areas where they now reside, their removal, although for their own benefit, is also governed largely by dictates of administrative convenience. Further!! they are taxpayers, and as such, should suffer no disturbance\ out due compensation. We wish to lay particular stress on necessity for arranging that the Dorobo are fed, until such tin. they can make new7 arrangements. They might further be gra one years exemption from hut and poll tax.932. Another matter which will require careful consider;&apos; is the fact that Chepalungu is an East Coast Fever area, ana Dorobo-owned stock removed from a &quot;clean&quot; area will in all] ability die on reaching their destination.

THE NZOIA province Chapter IX]The Elgeyo and Marakwet1988. In order that the needs of the Elgeyo and Marakwet may Economio hp better appreciated we shall offer a brief account of the Condition of 110    w jri. thfl   HllcrAvn989. The Elgeyo country is very precipitous. There is a small The Elgeyo ) at the top of the escarpment which is excellent grazing land. ; not used for agriculture to any considerable extent because it io cold for the crops which the natives favour. Below that the rpment falls steeply to the Tembach ledge, which is very nar-but contains land suitable both for grazing and agriculture, w that again the scarp drops down to the Eerio Valley where t low-lying plain is inhabited by the Mutei section, in which re food crops are very indifferently cultivated.990. So far as can be gathered from the evidence and loranda which we have received on the subject of land, it would ar that agricultural plots are individually owned. The bound-between these plots are usually marked by stones, which in tselves are often inconspicuous, but which are well known to tatives concerned. It appears that cultivation rights are some-s bartered for honey, but whether such transactions are re-lable or not is a point which has not been made clear.991. Grazing rights are common to the tribe as a whole. Any re can graze his stock anywhere irrespective of location. Modi-ion is probably desirable in order that the use of pasture may on trolled.1)92. The tribe is said to own 18,855 cattle, 16,937 sheep and )5 goats, according to the estimate submitted in evidence, h gives a nominal average of 13 acres available for each head ttle. But a large extent of the country, probably not less than arter, consists of precipitous land which is useless for grazing tittle and there are also 22 square miles which are native ve forest.. The land available and suitable for grazing is thus :ed to about nine acres per head. When we take into con-convention the fact that there are also upwards of thirty thousand i and goats to be carried, it is clear that the land is fully ed. The difficulty of the situation is aggravated by the fact here are estimated to be some 20,000 Elgeyo cattle and 40,000 &apos; and goats being herded by squatters on alienated land. If ipntracts of these squatters expire and if then stock has in quence to return to the reserve, there will be insufficient re available.193. And yet it cannot be said that the Elgeyo have accumu-cattle in excess of their needs, since the average wealth per hold is only six cattle and thirteen sheep and goats.   It is store evident that they require more pasture.ner in which they live.the Elgeyo andMarakwet.
Part II Chapter IX]THE NZOIA province the Elgeyo and JIjThe Marakwet.Claims by theElgeyo.(1) Rights inthe GroganConcession.994. The Course of development for this tribe is clearly . the lines of mixed farming. There are considerable possibiliti agricultural development and some progress has already been n A shortage of good arable, land has sometimes been alleged&apos;, bu truth is rather that, owing to their lack of skill, the natives an making full use of their resources. Much of the land is dif and requires for its development a greater degree of skill thai natives yet possess, but, as better methods are learnt, more will be taken into cultivation, and better yields will be obtain In this connexion we invite attention to the Agricultural Repo: this district prepared by the Agricultural Officer, Mr. C. Malic conjunction with the Provincial Commissioner and District C niissioner which stands in evidence (Evidence, pp. 1971 to Id In one of the most significant paragraphs of a most intern report he states : &quot;The Elgeyo-Marakwet Reserve from being a lane poverty and semi-starvation might well become a countr plenty and comparative wealth. The natives themselves at present the stumbling block and their improvement general health must be considered the first stage in develop: the resources of the reserve.&quot;995. Meanwhile the piosition is that the natives are very ] agriculturists and stock, farmers, and we have to consider f additional facilities in respect of land might help to ameliorate! position.996. In Marakwet an average household has 126 acres of: available to its use, and possesses 4 cattle and 23 sheep and go so that, on figures, there would be more than twenty acres each head of cattle. Even after writing this figure down cons: ably to allow for the large proportion of unusable land (whit! scarcely as great as in Elgeyo) there is nothing in the calcula to suggest that the Marakwet have insufficient land.997. In the following sections we shall propose that cer additional grazing lands should be made available for the use of Elgeyo and the Marakwet (including the Cherangani). But wish to emphasize the fact that, wdiile these facilities should b great service, the land problems of these tribes cannot be simply by addition of territory. Permanent improvement can be attained by the learning of a better agricultural ami past practice, a matter of special importance in so difficult a countr998. The Elgeyo claim on historical grounds the right to,; their flocks and herds in the land known as the Grogan Conces a forest of some 328 square miles.   The reason for the &quot;Grogan Concession&quot; is that certain rights in the area have ceded to Major E. S. Grogan by a concession which expire 1957.
ITHE NZOIA PROVINCE II Chapter- IX] The Elgeyo and JIarakwet1099. The Elgeyo allege that they have always used the pasture in this area, and state that, about the time when Government ed, : the Kamasia also started  to graze their cattle in the hern block, which is known as the Lembus Forest.1000. When the concession was granted to Major Grogan a se was inserted in the deed &quot;safeguarding native rights as they led at certain dates in respect of particular areas defined on the attached to the document, but it was provided that the einor should cause such rights to be ascertained and defined in a reasonable period..1001. To this end Mr. F. W. Isaac, the Provincial Commis-sr conducted an investigation and found as a fact that, while Kamasia and certain Dorobo had rights of grazing stock, resid-, cutting fuel, etc., in the Dembus Forest, the Elgeyo had no ;s either there or anywhere else in the area of the concession, jrnment accepted Mr. Isaac&apos;s report, and the rights of the lasia and Dorobo and the names of the individual right-ers were officially recognized and defined in a formal instru-t signed by the Governor in December, 1923. In consequence his definition the Elgeyo were moved and the Kamasia and ibo were allowed to remain. This discrimination rankles with Elgeyo to this day.1002. Although a memorandum prepared by Mr. E. D. king and Mr. Juxon Earton makes out a strong case in favour le Elgeyo, which is supported by a memorandum by the present district Commissioner, it must be presumed that Mr. Isaac gave matter careful consideration and that his finding, which was pted by Government, was based on a full view of the evidence able. In his evidence given to the Chairman in England, he d explicitly that in the early days there were no Elgeyo living he lop of the escarpment.1003. We therefore accept it as a fact that the Elgeyo have no (1 historical claim to the area under consideration.1004. In any case, the native rights in the Grogan Concession been officially defined, and, in accordance with the terms of icence, no further rights can be obtained until the concession es in 1957.1005. The Forest Department has power to issue grazing ees in open forest glades, and some Elgeyo have taken out such ees, though no permanent rights are thereby created. We amend that the Forest Department should give preference to lllgeyo in this respect in so far as may be possible.1.008. In 1.957, it may be advisable to grant rights to the vo on economic grounds.

We have seen that the Elgeyo will in all probabil require more grazing in the near future and that it is undesiral that their stock should be greatly reduced in numbers, although there is much room for an improvement in quality.  An excharT of lands has been proposed by which the Elgeyo would recel considerably more grazing, the Grogan Concession more hardwoM and the source of the Eldoret Water Supply would be protect The details are very fully set out in the Secretary&apos;s precis pp. 1931 to 1938 of the printed evidence together with a statemi of the various opinions and suggestions wdiich have been advano A very large measure of general agreement had already bt secured before this Commission was appointed.   It was propof that the Elgeyo should give up : Area A forest land (largely scrub)    ...      ...   2,919Area B forest land (hardwood)        ...      ...      381Area C forest land (hardwood)        ...      ...   1,630Total   ...   4,933all of which are in the gazetted Native Beserve, in exchange ftArea D grazing land   ...   3.850  acres,   gazetted   FoJReserve,    subject Alajor  Grogan&apos;? f] cession.Area E grazing land    ...   1,129 acres Crown land.Total4,979 acres1008. Major Grogan&apos;s consent has already been secured, the Elgeyo Local Native Council has passed a resolution favj able to the proposal.   We consider it fair to all parties, and obviously to the advantage of the Elgeyo.   We recommend that be implemented.   (The proposal is illustrated in the map appears at the end of this chapter.)1009. Area E, which the Elgeyo would receive as a result nf above exchange, is part of L.O.

A small portion of this land may be required for exchange roses in connexion with a proposed exchange between the ive Reserve and Messrs. Taylor and Wallis&apos; farm, the object of r!i would be to secure a more convenient boundary. This ter is covered in the Secretary&apos;s precis, and a sketch map is ided at page 1938 of the Evidence.1011. The Elgeyo claim that the country in the vicinity of acc^taLake e Sergoit has always been theirs and they ask for permanent Sergoit and ss to the lake itself. Grazing in thevicinity.&apos;he District Commissioner writes : &quot;The boundary is gazetted thus : ... to a cairn in the icinity of the most eastern point of Lake Sergoit, thence by straight line due west to low-water mark on the shore of that lake, thence northerly by that low-water mark and the astern bank of the Arobukutch River to its intersection with the southern boundary of L.O. 876.&quot;1012. It can safely be presumed that when Government gave Elgeyo access to Lake Sergoit it did so with a view to affording tribe, and its stock a constant wTater supply, which is badly required  as there are no other sources in the vicinity. The lake times dries up and then no water remains apart from a few gs in the south-west corner.1013. The evidence of Mr. A. C. Hoey, who was the first european to visit these parts, is of interest on this point. He s that before the advent of Government the Elgeyo were ned to the forest and did not use this land. He adds (Evidence,mm :-&quot;At the time the Europeans came the first sign of stock was a few&quot; going on to the Sergoit side of the forest with a very strong body of Moran to guard them, and eventually the move-jment got bigger and extended into the Plateau and they [watered at Sergoit Lake, but the whole of that country was iiioccupied because it was unsafe for any natives to be there ith their cattle.&quot;anger was presumably from bands of Nandi and Earamojong liders.toil. It would therefore appear that since Government came jElgeyo have watered their stock at Lake Sergoit, and to this it then- claim is admitted.1015.

The evidence is that at one time the Cherangani ml were forest-dwellers who did not own stock, and cultivated onlt a small scale. When Government became established, adminii tive officers did their utmost to persuade them to forsake forests and take to stock-owning and cultivating. When ; acquired stock, they were allowed to live on alienated farms, used the Kaption salt-lick.1018. The Cherangani have some claim on the ground of user, and the land is fortunately for the most part unalienata1.019. Having heard the evidence of Mr. A. C. Hoey ai Provincial Commissioner and having ourselves visited the question we have formed the opinion, with which the Prov Commissioner agrees, that neither on grounds of right economic grounds are the natives entitled to quite so lar addition of territory in this neighbourhood as Mr. Hoey h gested. It may be stated with confidence that some of the est of the economic position of the Marakwet and the state of country, which are on record in official hies and have been br to our notice, are unduly pessimistic.1020.

Arap Kamussein, a native witness, informs us that they to occupy7 this land east of the Moiben, but were driven out 1 Karamojong raiders about 1875. Mr. Hoeyr, who hunted a leal over it from 1906 onwards, states there were no natives ent there, but gives evidence of having met Karamojong raiders stice, p. 1994).1023. Mr. W. P. Law, who has had a farm in this neighbour-since 1919 stated (Evidence, p. 1982) :-. A matter of twelve or fourteen years ago there were no Elgeyo natives or Marakwet natives on the south side of the jfherangani Hills at all. There was a chief called Cheplalam and he lived actually in the forest, being the furthest out -Ilgeyo chief in the area. In those days there were Masai oaming about in the vicinity of Mr. Eidley&apos;s farm.&quot;024. It is possible that there may have been some hardship 1 by the alienation of land in the vicinity, but in view of the :oe which we heard from Mr. Hoey and Mr. Law-, we con-that it is most unlikely that this was so.025.

With the political side administration our Report is not concerned, but in respect of la administration we consider that the creation of small mutually, elusive reserves, where racial considerations do not require the is probably a mistake. Where the custom of a tribe admits members of other tribes or groups coming in as tenants wo consii that so great an aid to fluidity and ease of distribution should encouraged. We are inclined to think that the gazettement small reserves operates in a contrary direction. While there possibly no intention that the boundaries should be interpreted barriers against a reasonable degree of peaceful penetration tl have, in practice, a restrictive effect. We believe that it would to the advantage of this group) of tribes (named above) that th should share a common reserve, the internal boundaries behve them being a matter of administrative determination. We treat tl subject in more detail in Part III of our Report, but we desire state in this place that we consider that a free movement betws these tribes would promote friendly relations between them it-lead to a more economic distribution.1029. We recommend that there be one reserve for all ill tribes.

443CHAPTER X.THE NZOIA PROVINCE.(6) The Nandi and the El- Gonyi.1030. We shall first discuss the Nandi. Their economic condi-may he useful as a prelude to the discussion of their claims.1.031. The total area of the Nandi. Native Reserve is approxi-ely 757 square miles. This includes one square mile reserved a township and sixty square miles of land either alienated or aside for alienation (he. the Kipkarren farms and the Kaimosis, respectively 43J square miles and 16J square miles). The ainder of the land is in native occupation and amounts to (59G re miles.1032. The total population is estimated to be 42,933, accord-to the Chief Native Commissioner&apos;s figures for 1.932. The ity of population on the land devoted to native use is therefore tvximately 62 to the square mile. There are, however, some 1. Nandi living as squatters ou alienated land; if these natives e returned to the reserve the density would then become 73 to square mile.1033. The Nandi, although primarily a pastoral tribe, practise culture on a small scale. No figures are available to show the nt of their production but we are informed that appreciable titles of maize, millet, sweet potatoes, beans and pumpkins produced. A few natives possess ox-ploughs, but the general of the people are opposed to the use of oxen for this purpose.1034. it is estimated that the total number of stock in the ve is approximately 150,000 head of cattle and 160,000 sheep floats. The District Commissioner in his original memorandum a greater number of cattle, but in a subsequent letter he pointed that, since the visit of the Commission, inoculation against o-pneumonia has been in progress, and from the figures of inoculated he considers his original estimate should he re-to the number shown above.  It follows from the population that the average number of stock owned by a family of five hteen head of cattle and nineteen sheep and goats, if these ties are correct.035. But the question of squatter stock has to be considered, ding to the Agricultural Census, 1932, the number of stock 1 by squatters in the Nzoia Province, amounts to 113,926 and 104,669 sheep and goats. The large majority of squatters i province are Nandi and the District Commissioner considers he stock included in this figure but owned by other tribes isThe Economic Condition of the Nandi.The area of the Nandi Native Reserve.Density of the Population.Agricultural Development in Nandi.Number of Stock owned by the Nandi.

We shall now examine how far the reserve canStock. lo be over-stocked.   The actual area available, exclusive ofor each head of cattle is approximately 2.97 acres, but th does not take into account land which is used for agriculti poses and for pasturing sheep and goats, or land which i be suitable for grazing. If all the squatter cattle were returned the reserve, the acreage available would be reduced to 1.31 i of cattle.1037. Out of the 696 square miles of land &quot;in native tion&quot; the District Commissioner tells us that 156 square n under forest, leaving no more than 540 square miles to accon the cattle, even if no deduction be made for homesteads cultivated land. This would mean, if the estimate of ( correct, that the land is at present carrying approximal head to every acres. This tends to show the high i capacity of the land, as we have it in evidence that the an grazing available is considerably diminished by grass fire are started by the natives in order to burn the coarse grass would not be the case if the land were stocked to its full ca;1038. The general condition of the beasts is good. ; yield satisfactory, and there are few, if any, signs of erosiot over-stocking. This indicates that the reserve is able to c; present quantity of stock, but clearly, on the return of Ian hers of squatter stock, culling and other improved methods of husbandry will become necessary.- 1039. The evidence of Mr. FT. C. Guy. Stock Insp Kapsabet, is interesting.  He is of opinion that the Nandi can support one head of cattle to three acres, and that with usage even less than three acres might suffice.1040. The Nandi has shown himself to be. by comparif other natives, an intelligent stock farmer and. as the gn excellent and the quality of the cattle good, his future wot;&apos;&apos; to lie primarily on pastoral lines. But the reserve contains the best agricultural land in the Colony, and it is clear tha economic results will be secured by the development of &quot;farming than by simple reliance on stock-raising and. apa other considerations, growth of population will compel.the a of this method. But every effort should he made to prese pasture and improve the quality of the native stock.

Wo did nd it necessary to inquire closely into the subject, and con-iitly do not commit ourselves to any definite opinion.   An esting memorandum  was submitted by Major W.  G.

The area enclosed by these (1 boundaries was some 70 square miles larger than that defined 07.04S. The Kipkarren and Kaimosi farm areas were included in ative reserve boundaries both in the proclamation of 1907 he proclamation of 1910.

S. Winston Churchill visited the NaialiB as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.1050. In respect of the revision of boundaries in 19H Deputy Director of Surveys in his letter C/G64 of 20th Septet 1910, wrote : &quot;Will you kindly supply me with information the boundaries of the Nandi Reserve according to the Treatt tered into by the British Government and the chiefs and e concerned?&quot; The Secretariat in reply furnished the requin formation, and made no comment on the wording of the I Directors letter.1051. Prom these quotations and from other informal io: tamed in official records it is clear that these agreements wi Nandi were of a particularly formal character, and were i nature of a pledge given to the tribe.1052. For some reason which is not fully explained the ence of the agreement appears to have been overlooked. In 1912, Government appiroved of the alienation of 17 h square in the Kaimosi area, which was included in the Nandi S Reserve both by the agreement of 1907 and the agreement of The extent of this land, which is now alienated as farms, is a[ mately 16i square miles, and the remainder has reverted tn i occupation.1053. In 1919, the existence of the agreement still beity looked, the Chief Native Commissioner informed the Governo a hundred square miles of Nandi Native Reserve could, be alie for Soldier Settlement farms, there being ample room in the re ing part of the reserve to accommodate the whole of the tribe. As a result of this recommendation 1291 square mi land in the Iupkarren area were surveyed into farms : allotinei ceeded under the Soldier Settlement Scheme, and a nuntl farms were alienated on 999 year leases.

By a small subsequent modification a further acres were returned to the Nandi, in order that they might the Ngoroin salt-lick.1056; While the whole of the land to the west of the Cogle reverted to the Nandi for all purposes, it was ordered under actions issued by the Secretary of State that the farm block to east of the line, both alienated and nnalienated land, should &quot;nue to be regarded as an integral part of the reserve; that all or similar proceeds derived from alienation must be expended le benefit of the Nandi; and that no further alienation in this was to be permitted without the approval of the Secretary of057. The present position is that the Kipkarren block (as The Total ded by the Cogle Line and the Ngoroin adjustment and one j^1Hjll^osi;tl&apos;esmall adjustment involving about ten acres) contains about quare miles, of which 33J- square miles have been alienated. Kaimosi block contains 16-J- square miles, all alienated. The of land withdrawn from native occupation by reason of these is therefore about sixty square miles.058. When the Kipkarren farms were alienated, compensa at Es. 50 a hut was paid to all natives disturbed; the total dis tuent was .- 2,485, representing a total disturbance of 497 huts Disturbance, approximately 1,500 natives.  The Kaimosi block was virtually labited, and there is no record of any compensation paid. 059. All rents received on the Kipkarren farms and all rents Receints by ed on the Kaimosi farms from 1923 omvards have been paid Wil-V of Rom. e Nandi Local Native Council.   This arrangement had the val of the Secretary of State, and we may take it that the t was, in the first place, that no Native Council existed beforeand in the second, that Government had spent the rents on vements in the area concerned, although they were not lly earmarked for that purpose.   We find nothing to be dueNandi in respect of the rents paid before 1923 and since that he rents have been paid to them annually. There is therefore lse of complaint in respect of rents.060. In the case of Kipkarren the farms were alienated under Receipts, by ldier Settlement Scheme and were of two classes, A and B.TheCompensation received  forway of Stand Premia.the case of all class B farms and syndicate farms a stand tun of  1 an acre was fixed but was afterwards waived. The acreage of such farms alienated was 11,245.lass A farms were allotted without sale. The total of them ,795 acres; they were in no way inferior and were perhaps
slightly superior to the 13 farms; and if a charge hud been dim the assessment for stand premia would probably have been perhaps a little more per acre.About 1924 two farms totalling 713 acres were alienated a the proceeds, totalling .- 1,200-10-0, were paid to the Nandi ho Native Council. And in 192&quot;) certain extensions to existing Ian amounting to 653 acres were granted for sums totalling  55G-15 and payable in ten annual instalments, which are handed io t Nandi Local Native Council as they accrue.In the case of Kaimosi two farms were alienated in 1913 a stand premia amounting to .- 430 were paid to Government. Sixte farms were alienated under the Soldier Settlement Scheme of It)-but the stand premia, which would have amounted to  12,250 the whole of them, were waived. In 1925 one other farm w alienated and in that case the stand premium was  1,050 v.! being paid by ten annual instalments, which are handed over the Nandi Local Native Council as they accrue.1061. The addition of the foregoing figures is  35,527, a might suggest that if Government had fixed stand premia on the farms, including the &quot;A&apos;&apos; farms, and if it had insisted on p? meut, and had paid the sums received to the Nandi. then t&apos;: the sum which the Nandi would have received. Air. G. Y. Maxw the Chief Native Commissioner in 1921, did in fact advance argument of this kind and claimed for the Nandi the full amount the stand premia assessed on this basis.1062. Although we agree that the whole circumstances most unfortunate and that every consideration is due to the Nan we, are satisfied that the reason for waiving the stand premia \ the inability of Government to collect them, and there is no do but that, at the time when the farms were alienated, there wa general impression that they were more valuable than they w subsequently found to be.   Unless the charges had been waived very substantially reduced, a large proportion of the farms wo have had to he surrendered.   Therefore, even if we accept principle that the whole of the stand premia were due to Nandi and should not have been waived without compensation, amount due would be very much less than the total which the b figures would suggest.1063. The evidence as to compensation paid for disturbs suggests that there were only some five hundred huts on the w 129 square miles originally surveyed for the Kipkarren farms, although there may have been some families who moved witl claiming compensation, it is clear that habitation was extrei sparse and that the only real use which the Nandi made ofTHK NZOIA PROVINCE rr   nn,-m, vi The Nandi and Ki.

As for the Kaimosi area we jukl never have supposed, apart from the Agreement, that it was indi country at all, or indeed that any tribe could have exercised y permanent rights there, since it was in the nature of a buffer le between the Kavirondo and the Nandi.1064. The evidence given to us by representatives of the Nandi iKapsabet shows that, while they regard the question of the jrkarren farms as their one serious grievance, they are more con-ped with the loss of certain salt-licks than with any other aspect(the matter. The following are extracts from the Evidence incidence, pp. 2074, 2075 and 2077).Amp Chepkigcn : &quot;At the time of the fighting the Govern-ment told us this was our boundary : The Europeans will be on that side of it and you will be on the other side of it . . .

I am prepared to admit that the grazing lands out in the direction of Alessos were not ours at all. We have no very real com-plaint to make except in regard to Kipkarren.&quot;1065. In view of all these circumstances we do not consider ilie true loss to the Nandi was anything like as great as would ear.   Taking into consideration the fact that they have been Ipensated to the extent of  2,485 for disturbance and are receiv-Itand premia to the total amount of  2,807 and rents amounting pally to - 310, we consider that the Nandi would be adequately fliensated by a payment of  5,000 as a comprehensive compensa-for the extent of the loss suffered by them through the actions which we have described.1066. The position in regard to rents should remain unchanged the Local Native Council should continue to receive them as e; also the remaining instalments of stand premia which are being paid to them by instalments; also any stand premia or (which may accrue from further leases of land in the Kaimosi Cipkarren blocks.

We recommend that the compensating payment ^5,000 be made by instalments, and be regarded as a loan made the Nandi to Government, bearing interest as from the date this Report but not previously, and that the repayment of the] with interest and amortization be carried out on the same basi if it were a loan borrowed from the Kenya Land Bank.Recommenda- 1068.

It would involve the acqrf tion of three farms in the south-west corner of the allotment, the remainder of the farms are unalienated. Two of the three fai belong to one owner, wdio is willing to exchange them for lam equal value in the block marked Sarora, while the owner of third farm has expressed his readiness to exchange it for unalien; Crown land in the North Nyeri District.1069. There is a salt-lick on L.O. No. 3147 with regard which we have seen the owner, Mr. R. L. Nestor, since it seej possible that an exchange of land could be arranged by which! Nandi could obtain the salt-lick. But on investigation we fcj that the suggestion advanced by the District Comniii (Evidence, pp. 2078-2079) would not have effected its purpose,! it appears that he had been misinformed as to the position ofl salt-lick. For this reason we make no recommendation, butf satisfactory exchange could be subsequently arranged, it could effected under the provision for exchanges which we shall red mend in the third part of our Report (sections 1474 and below).THE NZOIA PROVINCE Part II Ciiai-compulsory X] The Nandi and El gJ

THE NZOIA province Chapter X]The Nandi and El GonyiComments upon the Justice of the1070. Our third recommendation is that, when the boundary the Kipkarren farm area has been amended, the unalienated land ide it should be available for alienation to Europeans.Our reason for this recommendation is that we think that theamendment of the line in the manner proposed will fulfil the mrements of the Nandi, and we consider that native as well as i-native interests will be served by the alienation of the remainder the block. From the point of view of the Europeans the kartell block, though reduced in size to 62 square miles, would oine a consolidated block of settlement, and with the elimination &apos;slands of unalienated lands, a possible source of friction between ive and non-native would be removed. From the point of view the natives, the existence of this block of farms on land which &apos;n excess of their present requirements is an economic asset not v because of the rents, but also because of the employment vided. It can scarcely be denied that the presence of this iparatively small block of European settlement will exert an cational effect which will be of great benefit to the Nandi in development of their country.1071. We have endeavoured to make proposals which are just ill existing interests, and we believe that we have done so.  But ce in a matter of this kind fair-minded men may differ as to what Recommenda-onId be done, we consider that a few supplementary observations tl0ns-required, in order that our reasons may be made quite clear.1072. Critics of our recommendations will probably be of two sses, those who think them too generous to the Nandi and those o think them not generous enough. To the former class it may ear, that since the Nandi themselves have never raised the stion of stand premia, it was not necessary for us to deal withTo them we reply that the natives are in the position of wards Government, and therefore it would not have been right if the ie had not been i-raised on their behalf, and it is a point with ich we were clearly bound to deal.1073. On the other side we may anticipate criticism to the ct that the agreement made with the Nandi in 1910 ought to lonoured in the letter.  This criticism merits a detailed reply : (11 In the first place the matters under complaint are twelve years old, and other parties besides the Nandi have acquired rights which are equally entitled to respect. We do not consider that grievances of long standing can be put right simply by a setting back of the (dock and restor-ing the status quo ante. Such a return, if it were possible, would not in our opinion be to the advantage of the Nandi.
THE NZOIA PROVINCE Part II-Chaptkr XJ Thk Xanu1 an&quot; 1 &apos; (J&quot;nr.(2) We do not find the agreement of 1907 or the subs-ti agreement of .1910 to have been treaties. The first these agreements was made after the Nandi rebels but it was in no sense a term or condition of peace, was a definition of the land which the Nandi tribe sltoi inhabit as a reserve, and there is evidence that a pron was given that the Jand should be theirs &quot;for eve But there was no consideration ou the other side, and cannot subscribe to the view that Government she, never depart from such an agreement in any cirai stances. But in equity towards the Nandi there be no departure which is to their disadvantage there is such a departure, compensation is duo.(3) We consider that the original alienations were to the advantage of the Nandi in that too much land was a ated, and valuable salt-licks were taken from them, f the amendment made by the Cogle Line substantia reduced the grievance and the further reduction which have proposed, together with the return of furthers licks, should remove it altogether.  We consider the le ing of the remainder of the land to Europeans to economically to the benefit of the Nandi, not only heca of the financial profits which they will receive in rent; stand premia, but also because of the employment p vided and the advancement in agricultural and par-skill which is to be expected as a consequence. W satisfied that there is ample room in the Nandi Nat Reserve for its present population and any increas expected for generations to come.These are considerations which would have jttsti the Land Board in recommending the granting of lea if the Lands Trust Ordinance had been in operation that time.(4) On the other hand it is a principle of the Lands Tr Ordinance that leases to non-natives should generally for short terms. They are limited to thirty-three yet except that in special cases leases for 99 years may issued, subject to the approval of the Secretary of St; The reason for this provision is clearly that, while i possible to say that for a period of thirty-three year; possibly for ninety-nine years a particular piece of I is not likely to be required for the maintenance support of the natives, it is impossible to say that 999 years the land will not be required.
449THE NZOIA province Chapter. X]The Nandi and El Gonyi1074. For these reasons we consider that 999 year leases ought to have been issued, and we have given consideration to the lion whether we should recommend that negotiations be led with the lessees for converting them to 99 year leases in in for compensation for the difference in value. But the balance pvument is against this course. We do not think that it would likely to prove of any substantial benefit to the Nandi or that - would be any better off in respect of any negotiations which arise many years hence. On the other hand the loss of public deuce which would undoubtedly result from so unusual a con-on would have an unfortunate effect on the economic position ofountry. A principal object of this Commission is to provide a e land policy, and, although we think that leases for a shorterwould have been preferable, we are firmly of the opinion that attempt to alter them at this date would be unwise, and we ot recommend it.1075. Farm L.O. No. 1371 (2914 acres) forms a triangle ss the Mukong River; the Nandi ask that the boundary be sted so that the river should be the boundary. The natives i that this triangle was in fact purchased from the owner some s ago for a hundred head of cattle, but we have been unable to in any further evidence in the matter.The District Commissioner considers it desirable that this stment should be made if in any way possible, and points out the Mukong River has a considerable volume of water in it for nine months in each year is not fordable. We recommend Government should investigate the possibilities of effecting adjustment.1076. We now turn to the examination of the land problems other tribe of the Nzoia Province, namely, the El Gonyi. This which is also called the Elgoni or Konyi, appears to be of Dorobo stock and in the opinion of the District Commissioner, e, is descended from the original Serikwa. They are related e Uasin Gishu Masai, who are said to be of the same origin.

About 1,900 are reported to be in area (1), where there are squatters on European farms. About 700 are in area (2). whf they are forest squatters. Half the tribe are said to be in area I under a North Kavirondo headman with a sub-headman of ft own, and an unascertained number are in the Sabei country Uganda. Apart from the latter area it would appear, thereto that the total population of the El Gonyi in Kenya is appro mately 5,200.Ktock. 1080. The El Gonyi are wealthy in cattle according tofigures given us in evidence. They are said to possess 13,000? 5,600 respectively in areas (1) and (2), and if those in area (3) relatively as wealthy, it would follow that they have in Ke: to-day a total of some 35,000 head. This would mean that i possess 7 cattle per head, or 35 per family unit of 5.They do not appear to possess very large numbers of sli and goats though we have no figures except in respect of area where, according to the Assistant Conservator of Forests, Eldo they had 1,824 sheep in 1933, but no goats. They are not, It ever, permitted to keep goats in this area on account of the data these animals are likely to do in the surrounding forest, but! probably have a considerable&apos; number elsewhere.
T II Chapter X]THE NZOIA province the Nandi and El GonyiThe above figures, while open to criticism, are a sufficient publication of the wealth of the El Gonyi in live stock, and there is doubt that them one idea is to amass as much as possible pective of their needs or of the capacity of the land at their, posal to carry it.1081.   It must be admitted that the El Gonyi have a strong     j^j,dation to the mountain on historical grounds, but in view of their Claims, robo origin, the use they had of it cannot have been very great, it was probably used mainly for hunting and the collection of ey. But, unlike most of the Dorobo clans, they appear to have madly owned cattle which, however, they held very precariously g to the raiding proclivities of their more powerful neighbours, probably possess many more cattle at present than at any during their previous history, and the problem before us is to sider how far their claims can be met in a reasonable and due manner.  Part of the area they originally occupied is now ised within the North Kavirondo District; a part has been ted for European settlement; another part is now forest -e, and the remainder is in the Uganda Protectorate.   Colonel ins states in evidence that the El Gonyi move about in these and  do  as  their headman,  Arap  Kasisi,  does.    Colonel ins says Arap Kasisi sometimes goes up the mountain, some-to Uganda, sometimes squats on a European farm, and ever he goes he claims is the home of his ancestors.The El Gonyi desire a country  of their own, but it is hardly ible to consider these claims to a vast area of country for the sive use of a small and possibly dying tribe.082. The policy of the administration is to move the El The Alienated i off the farms, where they are an embarrassment to the -A-reas-european settlers and to Government, and where it is clearly not heir own interests that they should be permitted to remain. The District  Commissioner has already persuaded  a large ier of them to move with their stock into Uganda, but doubts Uganda Government is willing to take any more. He states has moved 200 families with about 5,000 head of cattle into agenda, and that there are another 2,500 cattle ready to go, but euted from doing so by quarantine restrictions. We have no in-ation as to whether any7 more of the El Gonyi can be accom-ited in Uganda.1083. We are informed by the Conservator of Forests that The Forest milies of the El Gonyi are living on the moorlands above the Mouii^EIeod belt on Mount Elgon, apparently in the position of forest matters.  This area is understood to include no forest and is not ed or possible for afforestation, but the Conservator of Forests tiers it necessary that his Department should have control
THE NZOIA PROVINCEPart II-Chapter X]The Nandi andThe Kitosh Location.The Uganda Area.Summary ot Position.over it in order to preserve the surrounding forest. There widely divergent views as to the extent of the area. Of the varii estimates before us we consider that made by the Conservator Forests to be the most reliable. He estimates the area w 40,000 acres, and produced a map in support of his statement, this total approximately 4,500 acres are in the Trans District.The greater part of the area is situate in the North Kavtroi District but a smaller part is in Trans Nzoia; it is all gazeti forest reserve.The Conservator of Forests has taken measures to previous  over-stocking, and considers the ptresent number of stock to W many as the land can reasonably be expected to carry.The El Gonyi are only permitted to reside and keep stock the area with the authority of the Forest Department, and tli cattle are required to be branded.1084. We have evidence that about half the El Gonyi living in the Kitosh location in the North Kavirondo Dist under Chief Marunga, but with a sub-headman (Arap Tencletti) their own. The Conservator of Forests considers there is aim ant room there for any of the squatters who are moved oft&apos; farms, but the Provincial Commissioner, Nyanza, thought tli might be some difficulty in accommodating all their cattle El Gonyi in this area are understood to be living in conjunct with the Uasin Gishu Masai.1085. The only evidence in regard to the El Gonyi on Uganda side of the border is, that of the District Commissior Kitale, who stated that he had moved 200 families with a&apos; 5,000 head of cattle into the Sabei country. From this we del that the two tribes are closely related, and that Uganda is wil to accept such numbers of the El Gonyi as can be accommodi there.10S6. With the possible exception of the alienated farm: the Kitale District, it does not appear that the El Gonyi have&apos; dispossessed of any land to which they are in equity and jus entitled, but they have no country which they can call their o unless the Sabei country comes within that category. Some squatters on farms, some are forest squatters on the moorland Mount Eigon and others are merged in the North Kavird District with the Uasin Gishu Masai under a North Kavii headman.
451THE NZOIA PROVINCE [j_Chapter X] The Nandi and El GonyiWe have heard no complaints that the first group have not cient land for grazing, and for agriculture if they wish to ivate, and the same applies to those in the Sabei country. We therefore only concern ourselves with the El Gonyi on the ile farms and in the forest reserve on Mount Elgon.1087. Our recommendations are as follows :  lUvoiomencla-(1) That the policy of the administration of moving the El Gonyi from the alienated farms should be continued unless they become squatters under the usual agreement, but that the question of compensation be considered.We recommeud that such of them as have resided in the farm area continuously for a period of three years or thereabouts shall receive compensation, and that all native rights reserved in the leases in respect of each area should thereafter be extinguished. The degree of disturbance among such a nomadic race would not be very great, and we consider the administration should decide what is fair compensation.(-2) That the Uganda Government be approached on the question of accommodating more of the El Gonyi in its territory and, if they can be accepted, that those who are moved off&apos; the farms be given the option of going there or into the North Kavirondo District, or, if there is room for them, on to the moorlands of Mount Elgon.That the moorland area, some 40,000 acres in Kenya above the forest belt on Mount Elgon be reserved for the use and occupation of the El Gonyi, and that the whole area be included in the Kavirondo Reserve as Class A land.We consider the El Gonyi have a strong claim to this area on historical grounds, and that they are in equity entitled to the use of it. We do not think they should be in the position of registered squatters, wdio have to obtain special permission to reside there and who are liable to eviction.We fully appreciate the arguments of the Conserva-tor of Forests for retaining the area as Forest Reserve and consider it has been well managed, particularly in regard to the over-slocking question, under his super-vision. But we cannot agree that so large an area of grazing land can properly be regarded as forest reserve, and in our opinion the surrounding forest, streams and springs can be equally well protected if it ceases to be

452CHAPTEE XLTHE NYANZA PROVINCE.The Adequacy of the Three Kavirondo Reserves to the Needs of the Occupant Tripes.[088. This and the following three chapters will be devoted to The Question Jund problems of the Nyanza Province.  In the present chapter       u seti shall discuss the question whether the Native Reserves of the Kavirondo districts, comprising a total area of 7,114 square are adequate to the needs of a population, estimated accord-to the Chief Native Commissioner^ estimate dated 2nd June, to be 1,029,422 persons.1089. North Kavirondo is inhabited almost entirely by a Seme Account ber of closely allied tribes, who are usually known collectively j^i^itine e Bantu Kavirondo.   There is, however, a small colony of Tribes, who are of Nilotic origin, in the locations of Buholo, Wanga, South Marama.   With the exception of the Samia location tral  Kavirondo   is   almost   entirely   Luo;   while  in   South irondo the bulk of the population are either Ltto or Kisii, the being a Bantu tribe inhabiting the highlands in the vicinity the District headquarters.   These tribes differ considerably in try and attainments, but in the following short discussion of economic position it will be necessary to generalize.L090. Very full  economic  surveys  of  the  three Kavirondo Sources of icts have been prepared by Messrs. M. H. Grieve, Agricul- Inforraatija-Officer,  Kakamega,  A.   S.  Hartley,  Agricultural  Officer, tral Kavirondo and Major C. E. V. Buxton, District Commis-er.  South   Kavirondo,   and   stand   in   evidence   (Evidence, 206-2220,   2247-2260,   2348-2366).     In   addition   to   these eys, statistics of population  and density were prepared by R. F. Palethorpe at our request, while he was acting as our tant Secretary.  These tables will also be found in the printed ence.1091. The first point that strikes us is the very large population The Popula-ese reserves.  The position is that rather more than one-third tlan of tl,e e total population of the Colony is inhabiting rather less than hirtieth part of its total area.1092. Large numbers of the Kavirondo, both Dantu and ic, go out to work outside their reserve and the Chief Registrar atives informs its that the average number so employed anted to 51,494 in 1931. In contradistinction to the Kikuyu other tribes, they do not, in general, leave their reserve per-jntly, nor do they bring their families with them when they

The rate of increase of population appears to varyi siderably in the three districts, the final figures given by Administrative Officers who have submitted memoranda 1*1 0.8 per cent annually in Central Kavirondo, 1.2 per cent in Ki Kavirondo and 1.5 per cent in South Kavirondo, as against l.fi cent estimated for Kikuyu. The officers concerned make it q clear that these figures can only be taken as approximate, bat ratios may be accepted as being reasonably accurate, for there been a considerable migration of recent years from On Kavirondo to South Kavirondo. which would account lor greater increase in the latter district and the small figure sin for the former.4094. The density of the population varies greatly from Ii tion to location, the peak being reached in Bunyorc !.\( Kavirondo) where it is said to attain the abnormal figure of 1, per square mile.1095. The soil in this region is exceedingly fertile, and i sumahly the natives realize that a small area under cultivation 1;J will yield as much as a larger area elsewhere.  But even if t! so, there are obvious dangers to health in a population with, if an elementary knowledge of hygiene being congregated in so g a density, and a more even distribution should be encVmraj Fortunately there are large areas of cultivable, but not ettltiva land elsewhere in the district, and therefore it would seem, wit! entering into details of land tenure, that relief from conges could be afforded by penetration into other locations where s land can be found.1096. The agricultural sections of the economic survey us quite clearly that the people are definitely agricultural rat than pastoral, though possibly the tendency is in the oppo direction in Kitosh in North Kavirondo, Kano and Nyakatch Central Kavirondo, and the Luo locations of South Kaviroml a whole are definitely agricultural.1097. There are two points in the surveys which strike! forcibly; first, the average yield per acre is extremely small, lunfl regard to the quality of the land and the fact that a large pail it will yield at least two crops per annum: and secondly, amount of produce sold per household is also small, aniniiiil only to some Sh. 12 in North Kavirondo.   These points attj considerable importance when considered in connexion with
THE NYANZA province Chaptek XI]The Kaviiiondo Reservesrequirements of the prospective population, for they show increased skill should enable the same land to support a very h larger population at a higher standard of life.109S. We believe that the possibilities of obtaining increased Possibility of js per acre are very great. The details of the measures which *&quot;gjlg5ed ild be adopted in order to improve present conditions scarcely within our terms of reference, but are the concern of the utmcnt of Agriculture. Tribes whose methods of agriculture not greatly changed within living memory cannot be expected Jv to assimilate new ideas, but the work of teaching must go teadily and unceasingly, and it must always be borne in mind better methods of cultivation are essential in order to conserve resources of the soil.1099. We may presume that changing conditions will neces-c some capital expenditure on the part of the natives in order btain increased yields.1100. In order that they may be in a position to meet such nditure, it is necessary that their purchasing power in other the available balance of the family budget be increased, can this increase of purchasing pow-er be obtained?1101. Two methods at once suggest themselves. An increased ge can be planted and cash crops of an economic character be encouraged. There is no doubt that there are many such well suited to Kavirondo. Any measures taken to stimulate action of cash crops will be especially valuable, and will con-:te greatly to the revival of trade and the prosperity of the res.1102. At present the greatest source of income is the external t market, and it is necessary to remember that the very -e earnings of the natives by sale of produce are considerably mented by the w^ages earned and remitted by the young men leave the reserve to work for Europeans, and recently by the ng up of parts of the country to mining.103. Memoranda have been submitted to us by the District tissioners of the three Kavirondo districts on the subject of tenure.  We have also read the report of the Committee ap-ed to inquire into the system of land tenure obtaining in North rondo, and a memorandum by Mr. E. B. Flosking, District er, on the difficulties experienced in endeavouring to imple-t the recommendations of the Committee.   We have in addi-heard the evidence of a number of informed witnesses, both european and native (Evidence, pp.   2285-2288, 2292-2299, 2347, 6, 2401).Land Tenure in  Kavirondo.
THE NYANZA PROVINCE Part II Chapter XI] The Kavirondo Jits.1104. It appears that laud tenure in all the Kavirondo hi.-is based on the clan system. The Luo, perhaps even more other tribes, seem to experience a difficulty in distingufc between the ownership of land and the possession of political pt and disputes about land boundaries are not so much cones with the land itself as with the question of who is to be hear] or ruler of a location or section ; we had considerable difficult making them understand that we were not concerned with matters.1105. But. the emergence of land problems, as such, and development of a more private form of right-holding are t expected, and signs of them are already apparent. From a pe of the evidence and memoranda, we have formed the general that the systems are sufficiently elastic in themselves to permit reasonable freedom of movement in the population, whiles; taneous migrations from congested into less congested local should in ii large measure prevent any problems of local con^e from becoming acute. This view is shared by the Provi; Commissioner.1106. Modifications in the system of tenure may be expei to a large extent, to come about spontaneously as the native look accommodates itself to changing conditions, and it vril the task of the administrative officers to observe and sonier to guide. There may also be occasions when it becomes neces to regulate, and in the third part of our Report we shall con: the manner in which rules should be made.1107. While we state our opinion that a gradual advance more private form of tenure is to be welcomed, and wdiile elsew in our Report we mention some of the main difficulties whicl likely to be encountered, the detailed study of the question task proper to the administrative officers on the spot. But wish to lay stress on the fact that the question of land tentt of fundamental importance for the development of the rese especially among the agricultural tribes.Adequacy of 1108. We must now attempt to answer the specific qtte;the Reserve-. f0 which our economic analysis is directed, namely, &quot;hi Kavirondo Reserves adequate for the present and future needs o population?&quot; The surveys submitted for our consideration s quite clearly that there are extensive tracts of arable land w have not yet been brought under cultivation. There are also 1 areas of swamp land and fly-infested country, of which no us made. We anticipate that this land will in the future be bloc-i into use by clearing of bush and draining of swamps.

The general opinion expressed by European witnesses, iding administrative officers and missionaries, is that no exten-of the reserves is necessary at present. We invite special ition to the evidence of the Provincial Commissioner and jdeacon Owen. We accept this view and express the general sion that the Kavirondo Reserves are adequate for the needs ie natives.RIO. It is possible that in the more distant future there might Bongestion, if general conditions, apart from population, remain Jiiw are, But we are confident that the advance to be expected ricultural skill and practice will improve at once the standard e and the capacity of the reserve to carry a greater population, ngh it appears that the rate of population increase is some-high, we do not apprehend that any problems are likely to in this connexion which cannot be solved by an internal dis-tion.   We find no reason to believe that, within any period it is necessary for us to contemplate, growth of population outstrip the growing capacity of the country, when properly ped, to support the greater numbers.
CHAPTER XII.THE NYANZA PROVINCE.The Specific Claims of the Kavirondo Districts.Claim by theKanyakwarClan.Claim toKisumuTownship.(b) Claims of Right in the Kavirondo Districts. 1111. We now proceed to the discussion of specific claim grievances of the natives of the Kavirondo districts.   The striking thing about them is that they are so few and so comp tively unimportant.   It is no small tribute to Government these natives, whose numbers are more than a million, sh have so little about which to complain.1112. Nevertheless we derived the impression during- our to Kavirondo that there is some feeling of unrest with regati land. It is not well founded, except possibly in so far as the fu. of the gold-mining industry is concerned. But it cannot ascribed entirely to this cause, and the feeling of uneasiness equally apparent in Central Kavirondo, which has not been op to prospecting. It is true that certain small areas of land i been acquired for Government, missionary and trading puvpo but almost every exclusion or alienation has been made in that the natives themselves might reap the benefits.1113. The natives of the Kanyakwar clan (Luo) claim lam the Kisumu and Kano locations of Central Kavirondo and in Kisumu township. In so far as this claim relates to the i reserve, it does not come within our terms of reference. It matter of internal adjustment which at present comes within purview of the Lands Trust Board. We shall discuss the worl of the ordinance and make recommendations thereon in Part of the Report, and we need not concern ourselves further with claim of the Kanyakwar, except in so far as Kisumu townslii concerned.1114. In connexion with this claim, a memorandum by C. W. Hobley, who actually founded the Government station i is of great interest.  He writes : -&quot;When we established the first Kisumu station on north side of the Kisumu inlet, we did so with the frie acquiescence of the Kisumu group of tribesmen; no vii were removed, no shambas were occupied by our building by the bazaar.&quot;&quot;Later, however, the Chief Engineer (of the Bail decided to make the terminus on the south side. This tailed the removal of the Government station to the same as the railway terminus. I was therefore instructed a 1900 to lay out a township on the rocky ridge where E
THE NYANZA PROVINCE II Chapter XI] The Kavirondo Reservesnow stands. The ridge was covered with thorn bush, and I saw no trace whatever of human habitation, past or present . . . I once did hear a story that a very long time previously some natives had lived somewhere on that ridge, but they had all died of a deadly disease, said to be like plague.&quot;1115. Evidence from Swahili who came to Kisumu even e the railway reached there bears out this statement.L116. It therefore appears certain that there can be no sound to that part of the township which forms the rocky ridge joking Victoria Nyanza but it is possible that to some extent e rights existed in other parts of the township.L117. The township boundaries were first gazetted in 1903, comprised the eircumfei-ence of a circle two and a half miles dius, with its centre at the Collectors office. The total area, ding water, was approximately 12,566 acres. This position ned until 1923, when considerably modified boundaries were ted, reducing the area to 6,980 acres. This has been further lied, and the area is now 4,780 acres, including part of Kisumu11118. This last modification frees an area of land of approxi-1,380 acres, which Government proposes to add to the [ral Kavirondo Native Eeserve, but has hitherto been precluded adding  because   of  the  absence   of   the   necessary   legal linery.1119. Commenting on this proposal, the Provincial Commis-in 1930 wrote :-&quot;I think it can safely be said that all land owned tribally iy the Kavirondo will under the proposed scheme be excluded torn the township and included in the reserve. Practically all he natives remaining in the now diminished township are nmigrants from other locations.&quot;120. It is therefore likely that the native claims on grounds lit will be satisfied by this addition. But there is another I which deserves consideration : Kisumu is the market through i most of the native produce from Kavirondo passes. Those s who live near the township are adjacent to their market msequently the township is of more benefit to them than to living in more remote places. In addition they benefit from insiderable market for perishable goods such as eggs, milk, hieh the township affords, and it is safe to assume that if itives have been disturbed by the creation of the township, have settled in  the vicinity and  are  deriving advantage
THE NYANZA PROVINCE part II Chapter XI] The Kaviroxiki1121. If these recommendations are implemented, we feel the natives will have been treated not only justly, but generot The particular claims of the Kanyakwar clan into which we! inquired at length appear to us to have no foundation snfficiei warrant us in pronouncing in their favour.The Bantu 1122. The Bantu claim to Masana is, in effect, the exrClaim to. sion 0f a desire that the Masana Valley should be included in north Kavirondo Native Reserve, the natives of which are lar Bantu, the boundary between North and Central Kavirondo bi adjusted accordingly. The natives have lost no land; they at. present living in a native reserve and there is no proposal: they should be moved. This claim is therefore purely an ints matter, and, except in so far as it involves the general quest it the management and control of native lands, which is fully cussed in Part III, does not come within our purview.Claim to 1123. There is an area of land of approximately 900 acivLand formerly Maseno near the boundary between North and Central Kavi.ro Mraerto at which is claimed by the natives. It was alienated originally: company in which missionaries were interested, called I African Industries Limited, and was ultimately bought had Government in 1926. On its repurchase, it was not added to reserve, but was used as a Government Social Service Centre now contains a Veterinary Training Centre, a Local Native Cm seed farm, and a model village.1124. The Provincial Commissioner remarks : &quot;The land was originally claimed by natives of Bun; (North Kavirondo) and Seme and Sagam (Central Kavirot and there must always have been disputes about it.&quot; 1125. Some of the natives resident on the laud were r pensated by the company and left, while others were allow remain.   These were removed on the acquisition of the land Government and compensation was paid to them.1126. It appears from  the evidence of Mr. PL 0. Sa Manager of East African Industries, Ltd. since 1903. to bet doubtful whether any7 of these natives had occupied the bind to the advent of the British Government.1127. Whether the original alienation was a mistake or m not now relevant; if it was, Government has rectified it am using the area as a social service centre. The estate is now used for the benefit of the natives, and those natives who living in the immediate vicinity reap the greatest advantage, therefore record our view that Government has fully met if! ewer native claims there may have been by the re-acquisition the land, and by using it for the benefit of the natives thenisel We would suggest, however, that the land should be form
56THE NYANZA PROVINCE jt_Chapter XII] The Kavirondo ReservesK] to the reserve, and it can then be regarded as set apart for purpose of a social service centre (vide Part III, sections 1526 and 1541).1128,. The Luo claim the land in Yala township as their own. Claim by Luc-claim has two aspects, firstly, a general objection by the township Ires to the setting apart of the township area and, secondly, a icnlar objection to the utilization of part of that township for [impose of a Roman Catholic mission school.1129. The general remarks we have made concerning trade ownships in our discussion of Kisumu township apply with force here.  Yala township is a prosperous centre of trade in Imiddle of an intensely cultivated and fertile area and it is of benefit to the natives to have this ready market.    The jjinifcy of the goldfields is bringing increased prosperity.130. Again, the erection of a large mission school is also of ilerable benefit to the local natives; indeed, that is its sole i. It is recorded that compensation has been paid to any es residing on the township land which was alienated to the on, and we therefore cannot admit that their claim is reason-No real hardship has been suffered and considerable advant-lave accrued to the natives. The land has not been excluded the native reserve.1131. The natives claim three Indian farms at Kibos where it Claim to t1 there were in the past some 37 native boinaf,, and they 0f*^eSRailway represent that some 60 villages were moved from Indian farms between Miwani and about  40 villages from. Mr.  Ney&apos;s farm  at Kisumu and gori.  All this land is north of the railway.1132. The Rev. H. W. Innis, wdio has been a missionary in rondo country since 1906, informs us that at that time there no natives between the railway and the Nandi Escarpment, was a neutral zone into which both Nandi and Ltto were to enter.   This is borne out to some extent by Mr. Jairo Omondi, a native witness who has been in Government in Kisumu since 1899.   He states that the L/uo used to into the area when the Nandi were inactive, but as soon as were any hostilities they promptly retreated south of the j.Il33. There is definite evidence that the railway was made lodern boundary and that any natives who had come to live I of the line were moved back in order to make way for the farms which were made available for alienation in 1903.1134. The fact appears to be that this land was a neutral zone :n Nandi and Kavirondo; accordingly we find that the i have no good claim to it.
Pabt II-Chapter XII]THE NYANZA province the Kavirondo ReClaim to MaxwelPs farm (L.O. 653).Claim to a Mill Plot on Kisiani River.Mkenda Swahili Settlement.1135. An application was submitted in July, 1906, by I British East African Corporation for 2,270 acres for cotton ing, and for the economic education of the natives, and in permission to occupy, pending survey, was granted.   The vincial Commissioner protested on the ground that the land already&quot;, as to the greater part, in the occupation of the nat After some negotiations it was decided that, on account of n; rights, only some 473 acres could be taken up.   This area subsequently conveyed to Mr. James Maxwell, the present ho1136. An examination of the records at Kisumu reveals great trouble was taken to ascertain the extent of native occurs on the land and to exclude it from the area granted, and significant that the land finally conveyed was only about a part of the land for which application had been made. Wo elude therefore that no substantial rights of individual na obtained iu that part. Eent is paid to the Central Kavin Local Native Council, and we consider that no further actioi Government is necessary in respect of this land. But because farm is an island in the native reserve, we recommend that, should come into the market, the Local Native Council or body of Luo or an individual Luo should be permitted to hi! it, equally with non-natives.1137. There is a small plot of five acres (L.O. No. 4660) on temporary licence at Kisiani by the widow of the late li Earn. It is an island in the native reserve and is claimed b; natives. The Local Native Council has recommended that temporary occupation licence should not be exchanged for a 1 but should be cancelled.1138. The cancellation of the temporary occupation is a matter for consideration by the District Commissioner, anj do not propose to fetter his discretion by making any recomrnl tion.  The area involved is small, and possibly cancellation licence would cause considerable hardship to the licensee.1139. The Mkenda or Nyangori Swahili Settlement is anl of 215 acres set aside in 1904 by the Provincial Commission! the use of Swahili and other detribalized natives. The rest] are not entirely Coast Swahilis, but are an assortme Mohammedan natives of various tribes. The Luo, while nol ferring any claim on historical grounds, state that it is their] and ask that the Swahilis be removed.1140. We consider that the land occupied by this settlJ should be regarded as an area set apart in accordance with thj vision which we shall recommend for the setting apart of lag special purposes in the third part of our Deport.
457THE NYANZA province-Chapter XII]The Kavirondo Reserves1141. Some of the farms on the Kipkarren River in the Trans The North in District, to the north of the Nandi Reserve are claimed by varm?&quot;6&quot; natives of North Kavirondo. Before the alienation of this land District Commissioner wrote : &quot;There are some twelve Masai ires in this area and one or two Kavirondo villages. The present piers state that they have moved out of the North Kavirondo and have twice paid hut tax on their sites.&quot;11142. The obvious conclusion from  this is that the North rondo natives have no claim to this particular area.1143. The natives who appeared before us  at  Kisii were lie in that they had no specific claims or complaints to make regard to land.1144. The particular question of mining leases in Kakamega [receive attention in the next chapter, and again in sections to 1594 of Part III of our Report, in which we shall deal [mining questions generally as they affect the native reserves.1145. In regard to the matters examined in the present ter our conclusion is that the Kavirondo have no claim of right ii can justify any extension to the native reserves beyond that ised in respect of Kisumu township. Whatever claims the rondo may have had on the ground of being deprived of as small patches of land for the purpose of trading centres, ons, etc. appears to us to have been more than amply com-ited by the fact that they have been able to utilize the former ;al buffer zones between locations, which were formerly battle Ids and were left uncultivated and unutilized as they them-j? admit. Moreover the areas alienated have been mainly used lie benefit of the Kavirondo themselves.SouthKavirondoNatives.Summary of the Claims oF Right reviewed above.
CHAPTER XIII.THE NYANZA PROVINCE.(c) Mining Leases in the Kakamega District. Special8 ^ 1146. Our general recommendations on the subject of ranTreatment of leases and other matters connected with mining will be foum the Kakamega the third part of our Report (sections 1558 to 1594). But we alining Area. s[^ev special recommendations to be necessary in the casf Kakamega, because this is the only area in which the necessit issuing mining leases is likely to arise before legislation in sequence of our Report has been introduced, and because we tl that any native whose case arose while the Lands Trust Ordin; was unamended has the right to have it settled according to Ordinance as it then stood. But if he considers, as we do, thai own proposals as made in Bart III offer better terms, he s! have the benefit of them, at his option.1147. A difficulty in putting this recommendation into prac: arises from the fact that nothing in the original ordinance cisely covers the question, and we have had to consider method of settlement is best in accord with the pjrinciples ai the terms of the Ordinance.1148. These considerations guided us in making, at request of the Secretary of State, the following Interim Bet dated 22nd March, 1983. The first three paragraphs expressed desire to confine ourselves to the subject of Kakamega and to le the more general question to stand over until our full Report. 1 following is a verbatim quotation of the body of the Interim Ee[ (paragraph 4 to the end) : &quot;When the question of the grant of mining leases in Nat Reserves arose, it was found impracticable to grant such h. under the provisions of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance, 18 with regard to leases, and it was therefore decided that the c practicable course would be to exclude any areas comprised in si leases from the reserve.&quot;No permanent exclusion of such land was required but met an exclusion so long as the lease existed ; exclusions of a temporarily, nature were not provided for by the ordinance, and it was that further difficulties would arise in practice in adding a sn piece of land to the reserve each time a lease was granted.&quot;In these circumstances, as a purely temporary measure a without prejudice to any recommendations which we might ik or any action which the Government might subsequently decide take upon our recommendations, the Native Lands Trust (Ametl ment) Ordinance, 1932, was passed.AU1noppffe ict eiscis prole la-re101
THE NYANZA PROVINCE II Chapter XIII] Kakamega Minino Leases&quot;We were consulted before the passing of the amending ordin-and raised no objection to it as a temporary measure, as itared to us that, if any action were taken under it, the nativested would be treated in a perfectly fair manner and would in )e as generously, if not more generously, treated than would ie case with  a European upon  whose property gold wasfcvered.&quot;We are now in a position, in the light of the evidence which nee been obtained, to state the general lines upon which we lise that the question as regards mining in North Kavirondo be settled.tinder our seventh term of reference we are asked to review orking of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance, 1930, and to recommendations without involving any departure from the iples of that Ordinance; we feel that the amending Ordinance wise relieves us of our duty to do this.Soon after beginning to give this subject detailed considera-we came to the conclusion that, as prospecting had begun Kakamega area before our Commission had been appointed, ; it was taking place in a well-populated part of the Kavirondo Reserve, any land taken for mining purposes il as far as possible be taken strictly in accordance with any pie, major or minor, of the Native Lands Trust Ordinance, which could conceivably be held on any reasonable grounds derlie or be embodied in that ordinance; in that category we place the provision that, if land is excluded from a reserve, a in land equal in extent and as far as possible equal in value Idetl to that reserve.We therefore consider that an addition should be made to reserve of an area equal in value and extent to the sum of the likely to be excluded in the near future by mining leases.We have made inquiries as to whether any land is available .ious to the reserve which might be added to it; the choice is , and we are of opinion that the best solution of the problem be the following : here is in the reserve close to the North Kavirondo mining native forest reserve of approximately 58,000 acres, and onsultation with the Conservator of Forests we recommend portion of this land be taken out of that reserve and made lejbr any natives in the North Kavirondo area who may be essed by mining leases, and that in lieu thereof a portion Elgon Forest Reserve, which is a Crown forest, be added North Kavirondo Reserve.
THE NYANZA PROVINCE Part II Chapter XIII] Kakamega Mindjo U&quot;It is anticipated that at the maximum ten mining leases no case exceeding fifty acres, are likely to be taken out durinn next year, involving at the most some five hundred acres; recommend therefore that an area of fifteen hundred acres be m available in the North Kavirondo Forest Reserve to provide aga -all contingencies which can reasonably be foi-eseen, and that area added to the reserve from the Elgon Forest Reserve sh( be of not less extent and as far as possible of equal value to: taken from the North Kavirondo Forest Reserve.&quot;The land from this latter forest area, thus made available dispossessed natives, would be in their own native reserve and far from the land which they would be leaving and would be. agricultural land; no natives other than those dispossessed sh be allowed to use this land but as and when a mining leas granted, any native dispossessed by such lease should be given area equal in size to that which he had lost and should enjoy same  rights  over it  which he enjoyed under native law custom over the land which he occupied before the grant of lease.  In addition he should receive full compensation for his and other buildings, for any crops which he was unable to r for disturbance, and also a sufficient sum to enable him to pure food for his family until he was able to reap crops from his land.&quot;We consider that the above proposals both compensate tribe for any loss which it might be thought to have suffered, also the individual native, who gains the use of an area elos his home instead of one at a distance from it.&quot;As we have seen above, the Native Lands Trust Ordiii; -appears only to contemplate permanent exclusion from a rest and is silent as to temporary exclusion. But, we are of opi that if land is only temporarily excluded from a reserve ir w be a full compliance with the spirit of the ordinance if the eo ponding addition were also of a temporary character. Then .an addition of land for a period of time coincident with that mining lease would meet the case, together with, at the expir; -of the lease, a permanent addition of such land in respect of which had been permanently destroyed by mining operations dc the lease, assessed on a generous basis, having regard to the -convenience in working the land caused by the presence of rn areas and loss of amenities.&quot;The question thus arises whether the land to be added tc reserve should be added permanently or only during the curn of mining leases.
THE NYANZA PROVINCE rj_Chapter XIII] Kakamega Mining Leases-&quot;As we have stated above, we consider that a temporary addi-would be in accordance with the spirit of the 1930 Ordinance, unless the law be again temporarily amended there is no linerv under it to provide for a temporary addition. &quot;Therefore, in all the circumstances of the case, and having (1 to the comparatively small area of land involved, we recom-d that the land in the Elgon Forest Eeserve be added to the h Kavirondo Reserve, as native Forest Eeserve.   Such an ion could, we presume, be made by the Governor under n 15 of the 1930 Ordinance, after the Central Board had eel and consented under sub-section (1) of that section to the sion of such areas of land not exceeding in all 1,500 acres in akamega mining areas as might become the subject of miningIt might be argued that the proposal would not have been lit to the notice of the natives concerned under the first so to section 15 (1), as it would not be known at the time-i natives would be concerned. We suggest that the difficulty t be overcome by bringing it to the notice of natives likely to-ncerned, and, when any particular lease is contemplated, by bringing it to the notice of those actually concerned. &quot;When a lease is finally determined, the land will be at the-sal of the Crown, which as a general rule would presumably se of it by sale or otherwise to the Local Native Council individual natives.If it is considered that these proposals could not be carried jjh under existing legislation, we recommend that the amend-i\v should provide for temporary exclusions from and addi-to a reserve; if that be done, we recommend that the-iion and addition of land to the reserve in respect of mining ties in North Kavirondo should take effect only during the-cy of mining leases.It will be observed that if our recommendations be followed ddition to the reserve would be an addition of native forest e and that, as the dispossessed natives would be accom-ed on land in the reserve and not in the area added to it,, lurbance as regards native occupation would be caused when ditional area of native forest reserve reverted to the Crown expiration of the mining leases.We desire to emphasize that the above recommendations--only to mining leases which may be granted in the North ndo mining area prior to any action which Government may iter consideration of our Report, and that they are made after into account the conditions regarding that area and the-stances which exist at the present time.&quot;
CHAPTER XIV.The Claims made by the Lumbwa.THE NYANZA PROVINCE.(d) The Land Problems of the South Lumhwa Listkicii 1149. The claims made by the Lumbwa amount, in effectl an allegation that a great proportion of their grazing grounds f been taken away from them and alienated to Europeans, undisputed and we may mention that the Sotik farmers very fj admit that the land they now occupy, amounting to some acres, was formerly used by the Lumbwa.1150. The Lumbwa have an excellent war record and generous treatment. It is impossible to assess the land of \ they can no longer make use in terms of acres, but there doubt that in addition to the area now occupied by the Sotik h\ they grazed their flocks and herds over other considerable a real 1151. The rights which they exercised over this land v,vjj a nebulous character; at times they occupied it, and at times \M no doubt, driven away by the Alasai or other tribes. It is of coiH impracticable to recognize that nomadic tribes such as the Limtlfi and Alasai can be considered to have claims of right to all thelfi over which they may in the past have roamed and grazed A flocks and herds. But they have a right to a reasonable allow of pasture-land, and we shall make a recommendation whichi satisfy their just claims in this respect.1152. There appear to have been two main reasons foil alienation of the Sotik farms. In the first place the farms&apos; intended to be a buffer zone between the Lumbwa and i Jvavirondo, but the administrative officers concerned do not sider that the desired results have been achieved. Secondly, alienation was part of a general policy to depastoralize Lumbwa. There was, and is, considerable difference of opit among administrative officers as to whether this course was jus able. But whether it was just or otherwise, it certainly does seem to have had the desired effect on the pastoral proclivities the natives, as is shown by the fact that the Lumbwa numbers of their cattle on the alienated farms as well as in j reserve.Alienation of 1153.

460sideJjible value to the natives, who have laid claim to it.   The ice of this claim has been exemplified by Government retaining lick with an access corridor for the Lumbwa, though the jives have not yet been allowed to use it.   The District Com-practitioner in his memorandum, makes the following comment : &quot;The gesture may be magnanimous, but it is a mixed blessing, as natives will have to erect and maintain the fence at considerable expense.&quot;1154. There is much force in this argument, and as the land ittedly was alienated by mistake, we are definitely of opinionany necessary fence should be erected and maintained by [eminent out of the general revenue, not from the Native ierment Fund, and that the natives should then be allowed the of the salt-lick.1155. The above are the claims advanced by the Lumbwa on deal grounds; we now&apos; turn to the consideration of their lomic .needs.1156. The area of the native reserve in native occupation to-is approximately 821 square miles, the remaining nine square is of the native reserve being alienated on lease.   The popula-is estimated by the District Commissioner to consist of 67,942 sons, or an average density of 84 to the square mile.  In addi-there are some 3,815 natives residing on neighbouring farms iquatters.   As squatters&apos; contracts can be determined at any on due notice being given, there is at any time a possibility a return of squatters might take place to an extent which lid be embarrassing to the reserve.  We have evidence that the farmers are taking to mixed farming to some extent and, fore, the return of some of their squatters is likely to eventuate le near future.,1157. It is generally admitted that the Lumbwa have lent agricultural land not only for their present needs, but for any future period which can be taken into consideration; egli the District Commissioner informs us that great strides been made in agriculture and ploughing is becoming increas-popular, there is still adequate arable land available.158. No count appears to have been made of the stock owned ie Lumbwa natives in the reserve, but the District Commis-ir estimates that the number owned by each family unit is ten of cattle and ten sheep and goats. The figure cannot be led as being much more than a guess, but it is a guess by lerson who is best qualified to express an opinion.Economic Conditions.Area and Population.Agricultural Land in South Lumbwa.ScockConditions inSouthLumbwa.THE NYANZA PROVINCE _Chapter XIV] South Luhbwa District

But we did not observe any signs of over-stocking di our tour through the reserve, and it would in fact appear that land is able to carry its present quota of stock. There are s 35,000 cattle altogether being herded by squatters on alien farms, and if any substantial proportion of these is returned to be reserve under conditions as they are, congestion would ceriaj result.1161. We must however point out that the Lumbwa metlM of agriculture are partly responsible for any apparent shortagffl grazing which may exist.  It is their custom to scratch up a pMI

When the is ripe they merely cut off. the heads and leave the land to go - to bush.  Were steps taken to keep their land clear of this vth of small bush with which it is now covered, it would be &apos;e into as fine grazing land as exists anywhere and could prob-&apos; carry all the squatter cattle that are now outside the reserve. 1162. The general conclusion of our analysis of economic con-ns must be that, while no increase of agricultural land is ssary, it is arguable whether or not an increase of grazing is desirable for the present reserve population, but it is certain any general movement for the return of squatter stock would serious disturbance unless either an addition were made or arge areas of land in the reserve, at present useless on account e weeds and bush growing on it, were cleaned up and converted &apos;ass.1163. A[r. I. Q. Orchardson on the subject of land tenure amongst Lumbwa Lunibwa.   He represents that all land is the property of theas a whole and that individual property is only acquired by i work. If a man cultivates a field, the field does not become but the produce grown on it does, and no one else has anyto that piece of land as long as it is used for cultivation. It parent that the tribe has not nearly reached the stage when klual ownership of land can emerge.1164. Grazing rights are communal, as indeed are the grazing s of most postoral tribes.   This system does not lend itself &apos;ly to control of numbers of stock and use of pasture. 1165. In our view a strong case exists for an extension to How the umbwa Native Eeserve on grounds of right, in compensation ^would ^be^Iet1 he land formerly occupied by them which they have lost.  It &quot;cult to assess in terms of acres, but the Sotik farms and the south of the Nyando amount in all to something over 200 e miles, and the Lumbwa undoubtedly had rights over a good rtion of this land.   It is possible that these rights are still ive under section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance and, if so, ases of the farms would prove much less valuable than has to been thought to be the case.  We consider that the claim met by the provision of a suitable block addition of land to reserve and that, thereafter, any rights under section 86 can ibly be expunged.166. It remains to decide what area should be granted.  We compensato seen that the Lumbwa cannot be held to be entitled to the Area, area over which they grazed their flocks and herds, even were rticable for it to be returned to them.
THE NYANZA PROVINCEPaut II-Chapteii XIV]South LumbwaDishProposals regarding Chopalungu.Various Objections.1167. The District Commissioner has recommended that area known as Chepalungu be added to the Native Reserve.1168. It comprises approximately 164 square miles, of wh 71  are partially  forest-covered.   Its position  is shown on coloured   map   following   section   2152,   which   illustrates recommendations.1169. The District Commissioners recommendation is dorsed by the present Provincial Commissioner, and by Mr. (&apos;, Dobbs, C.M.G., O.B.E., who was in charge of the tribe forma years both as District Commissioner and Provincial Commission It is their contention that this addition would be equitable as i viding a fair recompense to the Lumbwa for the land which&apos; been alienated, and would meet the economic needs of the tribe.1170. A somewhat different proposal was made by the Ct mittee which sat in 1929 to consider the Dorobo question. Committee recommended that any of the western group of Dor: who could not be accommodated in the Nandi or Masai Resr should be settled in a part of the Chepalungu forest area, w&quot; however should not constitute a separate Dorobo Reserve, should be added to the Lumbwa Reserve.  It was anticipated f these locations would be known as the Dorobo locations, j Committee expressed general agreement with a suggestion nr by the Conservator of Porests to the effect that Chepalungu she be divided, a part being added to the Lumbwa Native Reserve general utilization, a part as native forest reserve, and the mainder being made available for European settlement.1171. The local unofficial European community is oppe to the addition of Chepalungu to the native reserve, on I grounds. The first is that, as the land is said to be suitable white settlement and has hitherto been considered to be in White Highlands, it should be reserved for that purpose in or that the European community might have scope for expansion.1172. Against this may be opposed the native claim, which are now seeking to satisfy. There is also the spieeial argument * Chepalungu is the Lumbwa apiary, and a very large trade in hot estimated to amount to Sh. 60,000 annually, emanates therefe If Chepalungu were alienated, the natives would be deprived of; trade and their grievance would be increased instead of allevia;1173. A subsidiary objection raised by the Europeans is t in the event of any serious disturbance or disorder, the Sotik fa would be in an exceedingly difficult position geographically, Chepalungu were native reserve. We do not consider that&apos; objection has very much force.   Chepalungu can obviously
462THE NYANZA province Chapter XIV]South Lumbwa Districtr controlled as an administered native reserve than as un-permitted Crown land, while, on the evidence before us, even tated land, if not properly developed and occupied, is apt to line a sanctuary for undesirables.1174. In regard to the further recommendations of the same (miittee that 29,190 acres should be made available for Euro-settlement, we have to observe that the evidence before us s that the amount of stock owned by the Dorobo whom it is sed to move into Chepalungu is considerably larger than was ed to be the case by the Committee and more land will fore be required for their accommodation, which would involve responding diminution of the land available for the Lumbwa. therefore consider that the amount of land recommended by Committee for alienation to Europeans must be diminished, ugh there is some force in them contention that the district as ands is on the small side to allow of the establishment of       - ; -tieries and other facilities for co-operative marketing. 175. In regard to the proposal made by the Committee and Conservator of Forests that a part of Chepalungu be added lie native reserve as a native forest reserve, we have evidence e effect that it is low grade forest with many open glades and e not impressed with- the necessity for this step, although we that the valuable timber in it ought to be preserved.HU76. After weighing these considerations we recommend that  Recommenda-jumbwa claim can best be met in conjunction with the Dorobo tJ,?us regarding , as follows :- Chepnhmgu.1) That the whole of the land known as Chepalungu with the exception of an area not exceeding 10,000 acres, which would be available for alienation to Europeans, be gazetted as Lumbwa Native Reserve, Class A.That Government should reserve in it such locations as it may consider advisable for the use of Dorobo who are moved into Chepalungu as a result of our recommenda-tions in sections 978 to 982 above.IThat Government should take such steps as it may con-sider necessary for the protection of valuable timber in Chepalungu and in particular should conserve the forest at the headwaters of the Mogor river.That the European area be selected by the administrative authorities in consultation with the local European community.(7. The above recommendations differ in some respects from iposal of the 1929 Committee and that put to us by the [ial Commissioner and District Commissioner, and will inA Comment on the above Recommenda-cions.

We consider that this settlement of the Lumbwa claii will be just and satisfactory to the Lumbwa, and will also be the best interests of the European community. With the full sett] ment of the Lumbwa claims we recommend that any rights occupation on the Sotik farms or elsewhere which may hither have been protected under section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordi ance, 1915, or the corresponding provisions of the Crown Lan Ordinance, 1902, shall be held to have come to an end, and th there will be no hardship if they are expunged.1179. If our recommendations in regard to Chepalun^u a accepted, we see no reason why the remaining Crown land district should not be alienated.1180. The Lumbwa have asked for access to the Kibeit Bit salt-lick.   We see no reason why they should not be permittedJ take from it such salt as they require, provided that they are; no rights to take their stock there.1811. It is desired by the European farmers at Sotik that area of approximately7 5,000 acres in the native reserve Chemagel should be excised for township purposes.1182. They allege that in recent years a total area of 13,000 acres which had been earmarked for European settleitti was included in the native reserve possibly in error.  We made inquiries at the Land Office and find that such was not case, the land in question having always been in native occupat1183. At the same time, we entirely agree that a towns! Chemagel would be most&apos; desirable, and wTe recommend that provided.. We are of opinion, however, that 5,000 acres are than are necessary for the purpose, and that at the outside lj acres, or approximately two square miles, should be ample foi reasonable township requirements.1184. The general question of townships will be considers Part III of our Eeport and we would merely mention in this that we are not in favour of excision, but consider that town; should be administered as integral parts of native reserves, Local Native Council receiving any net profits remaining working expenses have been paid.  We can see no good reasoj this case for a departure from the general recommendation we shall make.1185. Sotik Post, which was set apart for a township,j therefore no longer be required for that purpose, and will -able for alienation.
63CHATTER XV.THE COAST PROVINCE, (a) Native Reserves of the Hinterland. 1186. The Native Reserves of the Coast Province proclaimed &apos;n&apos;u Native Government Notice No. 394 of 1926 are shown under the Netted. *? Iwmg titles : the North Pokomo Native Reserve; the Central [onio Native Reserve; the South Pokomo Native Reserve ; the h Nyika Native Reserve; the South Nyika Native Reserve; Native Reserves in the Digo District other than the Nyika ve Reserve.  The Taveta, Dabida and Sagalla&apos; Native Reserves originally gazetted as part of the Ukamba Province, but, for nistrative purposes, have since been transferred to the Coast, shall discuss all these reserves in the order named, except that liall consider the Central and Southern Pokomo together.1187. The North Pokomo Native Reserve, though proclaimed p^g North e of the native reserves of the Coast Province, is included Native&quot; tdministrative purposes as part of the Northern Frontier Reserve, iuce. It is 119 square miles in extent. The people are known ie Central and Southern Pokomo as the &quot;Korokoro&quot; and have affinity with them. The language which they speak is of the itic group, while the Central and Southern Pokomo speak a lage practically identical with Swahili. The area reserved to [iorokoro is believed to be adequate; no evidence to the con-lias been advanced, and the only observation which we have also is that, while we shall recommend that all the other ;e reserves of the Coast Province be regarded constructively ie reserve, it would probably be better that the Northern ino should remain separate, so that its future may in no way ejttdiced as to whether, for general administrative purposes, be regarded as part of the Coast or as part of the Northern ier Province.188. The Central and  Southern Pokomo Native Reserves The Centra) ise altogether 157 square miles, while the population, as pok0mO,,ltliern in the Annual Report for 1932, is 11,365, giving a density Native to the square mile. Reserves.9. The Central Reserve consists of two blocks and the lern Reserve of seven blocks, giving an average size of 17 miles per block. The small size of these blocks might t the conclusion that insufficient provision has been made for expansion, and that possibly the more favoured blocks might e congested.90. The problem which presented itself in deciding what should be gazetted as native reserves for the Pokomo was sparse population was spread for some hundreds of miles all
along the banks of the lower Tana river. A line drawn parall the banks and about a hundred yards back would include prarj cally the whole of their gardens except such as are made by side of lakes which are formed when the river is in flood.1191. It would clearly have been impossible to reserve whole river frontage of so great an extent of the largest potentially the most valuable river in the Colony for the exclud use and benefit of a small native tribe. The plains through whj the river runs cannot be agriculturally developed without irrij tion, and it is generally believed that very extensive areas, useless, could be rendered productive by large companies uj adequate resources. It is no disparagement of the Pokomo, compare very favourably with other natives in agricultural attaj ment, to state that the proper development of these plains is qd beyond their capabilities. But, if large companies could be indnl to take an interest, their presence would be of great advantage! the Pokomo in providing a local market for their produce and their labour. It is also probable that some scheme of co-operatl could be devised by which a company would manage irrigatj works, but the actual growing of the crops would be left in I hands of the natives. Sugar cane and rice are at present the ml successful economic crops; large quantities of bananas and tobacco are also grown.1192. The Pokomo keep no cattle, but have friendly arran ments with the G-alla, with whom they have a few cattle at call1193. In view of these considerations it was decided, we tl rightly, that the reserves which were gazetted would be adeqt for the Pokomo. They contained nearly all villages of any sequence, and most of the cultivated land as well as extensive af not yet taken into use. There were, however, several strij cultivation along the river banks in places not included in 1 reserves. We understand that there was no intention to preij the Pokomo from continuing to cultivate these patches or: extending them if they should desire to do so, and they have in fact, been prevented. We are satisfied that in present circ stances it would not be wise to interfere so as to prevent eultival outside the reserves, but we recommend that the position sin be regularized by an annual issue of a licence or permit, so j there may be no room for doubt as to what is Pokomo couj and what is at the disposal of the Crown.1194. If it should ever happen that grants are made to( panies so extensively that most of the land intervening belli the blocks of native reserve is taken up, it will probably be nj sary to increase the reserves to provide for the growth ofTHE COAST PROVINCE Part II-Chapter XV] Native KkseeJ
464THE COAST PROVINCE L ii-Chapibh XV] Native Reservesfimlation which would be almost certain to result. But it will be Tjiy years before such a situation occurs, and we need not con-jr it in detail.1195. In view of the large amount of good agricultural land i idle on the Tana Biver, we have considered the advisability [constituting a &quot;C&quot; area (Native Leasehold area) there. While think that native groups might well be assisted and encouraged ipply for leases of blocks of land to be held on group tenure in manner which we describe in sections 1880 to 1935 below in line with the method of tenure in &quot;C&quot; areas, we consider that status of the land itself should be &quot;D&quot;, i.e. that it should be irea in which no special privilege of race applies, and that there ikl be no restriction as regards either initial grants or as to isfer between races.1196. The Northern Nyika Native Reserve comprises 2,349 Tlie Northern ire miles, and has a population of 90,047.   A considerable pro- j[^Ii:^^at-veEton of this population is known to be living in the Coast strip kle the confines of the reserve, but even if tbey were all to in) the density would only be 38 to the square mile. The tttry, though somewhat arid and unattractive, is not unfertile, ,, if agricultural and pastoral methods are improved, is un-jbtedly capable of supporting a larger population.1197. The District Officer at Malindi considers that the Nyika le a claim to an extension of their reserve northwards, so as to tde the settlements of Dololo, Kambe, Dakacha, Lafiti, Adu Sameta, which contain a total population of 1,828 persons, of ini 97 are Sanye and the remainder Nyika. The alteration of idary which he proposes would add 414 square miles to the irve.119S. By the District Officer&apos;s own showing the density of lation in this area is under five to the square mile, and a con-able percentage of this population is believed to have im-ated since the reserve boundaries were gazetted. In 1917 i were only 34 huts at Adu, mostly belonging to the Sanye, now there are 102 huts, mostly belonging to the Nyika.1199. The Nyika are notoriously a people who have a fondness opening up new settlements for themselves beyond their re, and some of them have even penetrated as far as Ngao on fana River. There would clearly be no justice in extending sserve boundaries to include every petty settlement of this * and so secure large tracts of intervening laud to the use and t of the tribe for ever, to the exclusion of all other interests.200. We are satisfied that the settlement reached in 1926 by jroclamation of the reserve boundaries was a fair settlement of

We consider that, if the natives of Adu and the otlr settlements named can show beneficial occupation, they mi^ht allowed to take a lease of sufficient land for their requirement Having regard to the fact that there is no present demand for if, land in any other quarter and that it is of little intrinsic value. \ suggest that a very low rental would suffice.1202. The Southern Nyika Native Reserve is understood be reserved for the use and benefit of the Digo and Duruma tribe although it is not so stated in the gazettement.   The total area 1,825 square miles.   The total population of Digo and Dunnii natives living in the Digo District, of which this reserve forms part, is 49,653.   An unspecified number of them live outside tl South Nyika Native Reserve either in the native reserves of t! Coast strip or on private land, but even if they were all living the South Nyika Reserve the density would only be 27 to the sqita mile.   It is a fact that about a third of the whole area is cover by the Taru desert, but the remaining two-thirds contain lar; stretches of land suitable for agricultures and the reserve is fid adequate to the needs of the present population.  Any increase be expected in the next generation can easily be accommodated, reasonable attention is given to the improvement of agricultur methods.1203. A claim has been preferred on behalf of the Duruma rights in the Mwachi Valley. In the course of evidence given to at Waa in the Digo District on 14th December, 1932, a Dunn witness named Charles Mwakipuli stated : -&quot;There is an area called &apos;Mwamdudu&apos; in the MwaeValley, west of the railway, which has been given to Indiawithout our consent. We had coco-nut plantations there which we received no compensation.&quot;The District Commissioner, Mr. C. T. Davenport, explained tl the Duruma regarded as theirs much of the land alienated by 0 ernment on the banks of the river Mwachi lying generally sou west of the railway between Miritini and a point some miles sou of Mazeras station. He added that much of the land alienated li not been developed, and suggested that the natives should be giv certificates of interest in respect of their huts.1204. Mr. J. 27. G. Troughton, District Commissioner, Tave who had previously served in Digo District, stated in his evidence:&quot;In the early days in the Mwachi Valley near Mazera large area of land was alienated chiefly, I believe, to India
465without much regard to native requirements or native occupa-tion . . - There is, so far as I can remember, practically no non-native development on this alienated land, but a consider-able amount has been used by the natives for a long time, and there is a lot of native cultivation in the Mwachi Valley to this day.&quot;1205. Further investigation of the position has brought to light following facts : By an agreement dated 4th June, 1908, nine Duriuna elders, (a) The Agree-iorting to be &apos;&apos;the-elders of the Duruma tribe&quot; signed an agree- &quot;u&apos;nt ol 1908-t with Government by which in return for a payment of a Isand rupees they surrendered &quot;all the rights of the said tribe of any and every member thereof&quot; in certain areas of land which ided &quot;the twelve homestead plots on the banks of the Mwachi , provided that if any of the Duruma &quot;owners&quot; should be red by the Government lessees to quit their present holdings stop cultivating, &quot;they should be duly compensated.&quot;Under the same agreement they also ceded their rights to the ichi Forest Reserve and to a plot of twelve acres leased to a Tonks, subject to the same proviso as to compensation for dis-ance and subject to a special proviso that the Duruma people ild retain the right to visit the two &quot;kayas&quot; or sacred places on nd of Mr. Tonks and have access to burial grounds on any of ireas ceded.1206. The map following this page shows the present position, (/u The Present area affected by the Mwachi Valley agreement, as apart from Position onJ t &apos;&apos; i trio Land.brest reserve, is some 8,310 acres, of which 4,979 acres have alienated by the Crown on freehold and 1,648 acres on lease-while 1,6S3 acres are unalienated Crown land. There are also .1,657 acres which have been adjudicated to the owners in old under the Dand Titles Ordinance, but this land does nottr to have been affected by the agreement. &apos;he land was originally taken up in the rubber boom of 1908, when rubber failed, was soon abandoned by the title holders.

The Duruma elders were certainly at a disadvant in the discussion regarding compensation since the alienation of land had already taken place. The District Commissioner stated on information derived from the Duruma, that they twice refuse the offer of the thousand rupees, but finally accepted it &quot;been  -they considered it better to take wdiat was offered rather than 1 everything.&quot;In the course of evidence in a land registration case in Mon,b; in 1921, Mr. G.

In cause No. 1/c of 1922, taken before the Recorder Titles, one Lucas Algandi, a Duruma native, claimed the piece land known as L.E. No. 1037, 1,631 acres in extent, on the gro that it was Duruma country and that he had inherited it accord to Duruma custom. The Rev. J. B. Griffiths gave evidence ins port of his claim; the Recorder found it to be good, and freels title was issued accordingly. This land is situated in the Mwa Valley and adjoins both the forest reserve and the block oceu[ by the twelve homestead plots. This is corroborative evidence i the land was Duruma country. Even apart from this evidence, map itself would create a strong presumption to that effect : Na! reserve flanks the Mwachi Valley on both sides and it would strange if the valley itself, which contains the most fertile land, not also native country.1209. We are unable to make a definite recommendation the settlement of the Duruma claims in the Mwachi Valley, had certain recommendations under consideration, but impor evidence has come to hand at the last moment, and we feel t even now, we have not all the information before us which w warrant us in reaching a final conclusion.

We consider that these two considerations may fair balanced against each other, and that the exchange is equitail and to the advantage both of the tribe and of the Forest Departmenl The chief advantage of the exchange to the natives is that they J have a clearly understood boundary, which wotdd include their til sacred places in the reserve, and we accordingly recommend that 1 be implemented.1216. There are three small native settlements in the area &quot;(I which would be surrendered.  We consider that the Local Natii Council may justly be called upon to pay any necessary conn tion for disturbance, both to them and to any other natives who n. have to be moved as a result of the agreement.1217. The Taveta Native Reserve comprises 16 square The population is estimated at 3,367, giving a density of 73 tc square mile.   The country has been stated in evidence to cons&apos;, swamp,  dry   bush,   forest   and   pasture   land  in   the  follow in proportions :  Swamp     ...      ...       ...   11,720 acresForest      ...      ...       ...     3,680 acresDry bush.........    9,200 acresGrazing    .........     1,840 acres1218. So far as can be ascertained, the history of the Tav before the days of the British Administration is that they dwelti the rich and fertile Lumi River forest, and had to keep their call in their huts owing to the prevalence of fly and fear of the MasJ After the Protectorate had been declared, they began to graze tlj stock more in the open.1219. Archdeacon Maynard, who has lived in the district the past 37 years, stated in his evidence : &quot;A certain number have kept their cattle in huts and soaj in the open.  They have not feared the Masai since I cauief the country, which was in 1S96.&quot; 1220. It therefore appears that the claim of the Taveta to mo pasture land cannot be supported on historical grounds of long at continuous use, because they were in fact prevented from using: land by the Masai. But they are on firmer ground when they claim that they ought, on economic grounds, to be provided with pasto land sufficient for their needs.1221. The total number of stock owned by the Taveta It recently been counted and the figures are 3,532 head of cattle at 9,036 sheep and goats, i.e. approximately five head of cattle a 13 sheep and goats per family.

Although Veterinary Inspector Hassan told us that a considerable   part of the area shown as swamp is good grazing, we der that the grazing land is inadequate for the needs of the Stock cannot be pastured in the forest glades because of the nee of tsetse fly, and we consider that there is a good case for ddition of pasture land to the reserve.1223. The claim is supported by Administrative Officers and e local European residents.1224. There is, besides, another reason for recommending an on : the Taveta have their homes chiefly in the forest, butuse of its malarious character an effort is being made to induce to leave it and live on the plateau above, and for this purposean extension is considered to be necessary.1225. The proposal is that their gardens should remain where are in the forest glades, but that they themselves should make homes on the higher land, to which they would return each ing. It has been stated in evidence that the people are physically -developed because of the unhealthy nature of the country they inhabit.1226. The map following section 1235 shows the existing Taveta e Reserve and the various additions which have been proposed, curious shape of the Reserve will at once challenge attention, it will clearly be of advantage if any adjustments made for the purposes already specified have also the result of giving the e a more convenient shape.1227. With this end in view a proposal was advanced by Mr.. Marchant, District Commissioner, that the area marked &quot;A&quot; the map, which consists of forest and agricultural land and is sely peopled, be exchanged for the area marked &quot;B&quot;, whichtable for grazing.1228. The Taveta themselves do not favour this proposal, and Bnd ourselves in agreement with their view that they would lose than they would gain, since Area &quot;A&quot; is very good agricul-land, while &quot;B&quot; is of a very rocky character and not particu-valuable for grazing.1229. We are more impressed with another of Mr. Marchanfs proposals, which has the support of the Provincial Commissioner the present District Commissioner. It is to the effect that the marked &quot;D&quot; on the map, which are good pasture land, should ided to the reserve. They comprise twenty-two square miles, we recommend that they be added to the Taveta Native Reserve ative Reserve, Class &quot;B.1&quot;.The Need for more Pastureland.The Need for an Upland Area for Residential Purposes.Consideration of Possible Additions.

In order to consolidate the small northern &quot;isla Native Eeserve near Taveta Township with the main bloc recommend that the corridor marked &quot;E&quot; on the map be from adjoining Crown land. The Veterinary Inspector has inforu us that it would be possible to clear it of fly and so to provide act for cattle.   We recommend that this corridor, approximately f square miles, be Native Eeserve, Class &quot;B.1&quot;.1231. It will be observed that, if this recommendation is cepted, L.E. No. 4881 (Messrs. Sedgwick and Gbodwillie) vii an island, surrounded on two sides by native reserve, on a t by a block held by the Church Missionary Society which is treat for practical purposes as if it were native reserve, and on fourth by the corridor. There would therefore appear to be a o case for the purchase of this hind for addition to the native reset We understand that the owners are prepared to negotiate for disposal. While we do not feel that there is any obligation Government to acquire this land, we understand that there i considerable sum of unclaimed money in compensation tor v damage on deposit with the Teita Local Native Council, earmar! for expenditure at Taveta. Some of this might with advantage spent on the acquisition of L.E. No. 4881.1232. The result of these recommendations, if accepted, i be that the reserve, though still of an awkward shape, will be ci solidated into one block and will have acquired a sufficiency grazing land and an expanse of open country more healthy for natives to inhabit than their, present homes in the forest.

Masai in the past, by confining the Taveta to a nan space, forced them to an agricultural rather than a pastoral mi of life, and it is important that their agricultural habits should maintained and the degree of skill be improved.

While th activities should be encouraged, it is also necessary to ensure! the forest is not wantonly destroyed, and we understand from Conservator of Eorests that rules are in contemplation to regal the cutting of saplings, which should materially assist in preserv the forest without interfering with the legitimate needs agriculture.1234.

We suggest that Government should consider the ad-bility and practicability of inviting the neighbouring estate, the nilini Harbour Wharf and Estates Company, to enter into some i&quot;ement for providing &quot;the necessary irrigation works on some of agreement mutually satisfactory to themselves and the1.-235. While we do not make any definite recommendation, we f opinion that, if a workable scheme could be devised, it would f great advantage, not only to the company and to the natives, also to the Colony as a whole.1236. We shall next examine the land problems of the Dabida ve Reserve, inhabited by the Teita tribe. The area is approxi-lv 200 square miles, and the total population is estimated at 74. The density is therefore 198 to the square mile a high e for this type of country.1237. The evidence which we have heard on the rate of increase pulation is remarkable.   During the past three years, accord-to the District Commissioner,  the average annual rate of ase has been no less than 4.57 per cent.   Over a period of een years it works out at 4.26 per cent, which is so high as to cry unlikely, and is much in excess of the rate shown by any tribe.  There is no evidence of any appreciable immigration, statistics kept at the Bura Roman Catholic Mission, which are bly more accurate than those relating to the reserve as a whole, an annual rate of increase of 3.66 per cent in a part of the ve which is generally regarded as unhealthy.238. It is difficult to find an adequate explanation of so high e of increase. We do not consider that the figures can be ted entirely at their face value, but we accept the general con-n that a high rate of increase prevails.239. Land among the Teita appears to be owned by clans, within the clan territory there is a system of private tenure ting. In fact, it is said that sales of land between natives irnes occur, and are recognized by the tribe (compare Evidence, (32, 2749 to 2756).t has been stated in evidence that clan boundaries radiate from and proceed as far as the land can be utilized.240. The numbers of stock owned by the Teita are so few as almost negligible, and the available milk supply is very scanty.Ml. As agriculturists the Teita display commendable industry. ,beans and potatoes are the principal crops, while considerable ties of European vegetables and some fruits are also grown.The Dabidn.NativeReserve.The Rate of increase of Population.Land Tenure among the Teita.Agricultural and Pastoral Conditions.

It is generally considered that the amount of arable does not exceed 40 per cent of the total area, a considerable portion of which consists of precipitous slopes and forest, ft adopts this estimate, the average acreage available per family amo to 6.19 only, and, particularly taking into account the rapid ra increase and the progressive nature of the people, we are of opi that this is inadequate for the tribe.1243. It has been stated in evidence that, owing to cold dampness, maize does not grow well in the hills during the rains. The natives therefore plant it in the hills during the i rains only, and in the plains during the long rains. This strengthens their claim to land in the foothills.1244. It is probable that improved methods will enable i land not now considered cultivable to be brought under cultiva and the land under cultivation to give better yields, but, eve: we are satisfied that an extension is required.1245. After this preliminary survey, we shall now procei the examination of specific claims.1246. The Teita claim Wundanyi Estate, which is an i of approximately 1,288 acres in the heart of the native reser1247. The history of the estate is that in 1903 the Indi Missions Aid Society applied for an area of approximately two s miles in Dabida for the purpose of cultivation. In this conn the evidence of the Ven. Archdeacon Maynard, on whose advii Society took up the land, is interesting.   He states : -&quot;It was an Industrial Mission attached to the C Missionary Society with the object of helping the C Alissionary Society in its work by taking up land and hi the natives to cultivate better. This land was originally to the Society for that purpose, of helping the people i124S. The Society was granted the area known as WunJ and an unconditional title in fee simple was issued in 1906. I1249. We are quite satisfied that there was some native oil tion on the estate at the time and that, in fact, most of it, I all, was &quot;owned&quot; by the natives according to Teita custom IThe following are extracts from evidence : Rev. V. V. Verbi (referring to Wundanyi) :&quot;There were some claims . . .  Here the land was Iand nothing was paid for it either to Government or Inatives.&quot;hills.11

Hob ley :This grant covers one of the few fiat areas in the moun-tain mass, and I submit that its approval was unfortunate for was even at the time of its allotment of great value to the Teita tribe.&quot;Yen. Archdeacon Maynard, who has been resident in the vicinity for many years :&quot;We knew that it was &apos;owned&apos; by natives and that was [what we wanted . . .  The idea was to develop those parts of Hand that were not being used, and, if any piece of land was Required that was being used, then those people would be ompensated.&quot;250. The Industrial Missions Aid Society transferred its title st African Industries, Limited, in 1906, the year in which the old title was first granted. In 1916 this company sold the ty to Wundanyi, Limited, which in 1922 leased it to Major Drury for ten years.   This lease&apos; expired on 31st December,J.251. In addition to the manager&apos;s house and garden, the estate Ides a small golf course, and 173 acres of coffee in bearing. The finder of the estate is thickly occupied and cultivated by the ies, who are not registered as squatters, but live the normal life Stives in a reserve. Development of the land by the freeholders Saused some disturbance of the natives.1252. A permit to occupy pending survey was issued in 1902 (ras converted into a freehold grant in 1906; in the interval it appear that the question of native rights on the land wasIoked. 253. We find as a fact that the natives have a good claim to rid on grounds of historical use.  The freehold was granted to dustrial Missionary body, and in the same year it was trans-to a company, which transfer rendered it liable to sale in ent of liquidation. It is now developed for private profit. The 3 are anxious to dispose of the property to Government, be-they  recognize that if the estate is offered on the open market, ginal policy of utilizing the land for the benefit of the natives cease to exist.  The price asked is ; 5,000; it is claimed that es not represent an attempt to make a profitable sale, but e sum is approximately the amount which has actually been p the development of the estate.\A. The case for the acquisition of this land appeared to us ii strong and a matter of such urgency that, on 14th February, We submitted to Government an interim recommendation

We further recommend that the whole area (1,288 ; be added to the Dabida Native Eeserve as Class A land.  The of the homestead and buildings might conveniently be set apari a native social service centre.1256. The Teita complain that, while their present resertl mainly confined to the hills, they used in the past to cultivatj the plains and foothills which now for the most part lie beyond, confines of their reserve.1257. We have independent evidence as to the general tr this statement.Evidence of Mr. C. W. Hoblcy (Memorandum) : &quot;The Teita people in the wet season planted maize mi flats immediately surrounding the range. This cultivation i extended more than a few hundred yards from the base mountains.&quot;Evidence of Mr. G. R. W. Lane : &quot;The natives lived on  the hills and cultivated : foothills.&quot;Evidence of Hindi bin Hamisi, a Swahili who was attache!Thomson&apos;s safari and who later served with lord Lugarafthe late Sir E.

Their cultivation extends to the lower slopes c]hills and into the surrounding plains.&quot;1258. It will be noted that all the above evidence is generi character. It is evident that the Teita cultivated in the plainij foothills, but does not particularize as to any precise locality.1259. Archdeacon Maynard is more explicit in his evidf and states : &quot;To my knowledge considerable parts of it (Teita Jcession land) have been cultivated for the last 35 years!The Mwatate Valley has been cultivated for four miles jof the railway for years.&quot;
THE COAST PROVINCE II Chapter XV] Native Reserves-260. The alienated land in places goes right into the foothills, yen apart from this evidence there would be strong presumption-hat the Teita made use of it for cultivation.261. At the present day there is considerable cultivation by eita at the north-eastern end of L.B. No. 3880, Teita Con-ns, Ltd., extending for perhaps half a mile south of the Voi But on the rest of the concession there is practically no ation by the Teita, as apart from the Kasigao, an allied tribe, case will be considered separately.262. That is not to say that the Teita never had more use of n this, but we shall recommend an extension to the reserve ther quarter which will be more than sufficient to compensate aim in that respect, and we need consider at the moment only aims of the Teita who are still in occupation. We recommend egotiations be opened with the company for the surrender of ea of land approximately three square miles in extent at the east corner of the concession in the general position shown as &apos;W&quot; on the map which follows section 127.1. This, as we e, will include practically the whole of the land now in tion by the Teita on this estate.263. For a reason which we shall explain below (section 1269) ashler it just that the company should be required to make a urrender of this land.264. Part of the Teita Concessions is also inhabited by the The Claim of o, whose history is briefly as follows :- &apos; the KaaiSao-hey originally lived on Kasigao mountain, which fell into hands during the Great War.  Its position is shown on the65. The Kasigao natives were suspected of treachery and sported by Government to Afalindi District. At the end of the ley were permitted to return to the Teita District, but for strative reasons, they were not allowed to settle at their home at Kasigao, but were required to live on the slopes of aibe and Zongoloni hills near Mwatate. These hills are on the land which has since been alienated to Teita Con-s, and their position is shown on the map).&apos;6. The lease to Teita Concessions contains specific refer-the provision of section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, rights of the Kasigao and the Teita who were in actual ioti were clearly protected, the areas in occupation by them eemed to be excluded from the lease.

When the concessionaires discovered the extent 61 occupation, they applied for a further grant of 10,000 acres pensation, and an extension of approximately this aerea granted at a stand premium of Sh. 2 per acre.  This land is as L.R. No. 6924.1268. We consider that the best iiracticable settlement Kasigao claim at this date is that the company should su the area of approximately 11 square miles shown on the n marked &quot;X&quot;.

Without wishing to define the exact bound the area to be added we are of opinion that two hundred ac suffice in the jjeneral position shown in the map.1269. Since the original lease to the company was cone by section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, it is clear tht in occupation by the natives were deemed to be excluded ft lease, and there is therefore no injustice in requiring that they be excised. But under section 31 (5) of the 1902 Ordina company would be justified in asking for a reduction of reti1270. The principal drawback of the solution recommend that the Kasigao land will not be consolidated with the reserve, except by a corridor.

The District Commissioner has recommended that some square miles of land comprised in the areas shown as Yl, Jd Y3 on the map be added to the Native Reserve on the (d that the natives have rights on them and are still in un-bed occupation.  This proposal is supported both by the local Scial Europeans and by the natives, and we recommend that [three areas be added as Native lands, Class A. We also include r recommendation the small area of Crown land between Y3 ie Sagalla Native Reserve, since its addition would link up galla and Dabida Reserves.  This is shown as Y&quot;4 on the map, iniprises approximately four square miles.iii. The District Commissioner has also proposed, with the t of the unofficial witnesses, that the area marked &quot;Z&quot; ting to approximately 160 square miles, be added to the [Reserve. It is not denied that there is and always has been IJerable amount of native occupation in that part of the area lis adjacent to the hills, and the District Commissioner points h the addition he proposed would not only include existing 1 occupation, but would provide adequate opportunity for lexpausion. Although large parts of this area are fly-infested, \k also suitable for pasturing cattle and could be used for ose, thus enabling&quot; the people to acquire more stock.13. Notwithstanding that the proposal has been put forward Dusly, we hesitate to recommend so large an extension as native reserve. The claims of right include the valleys Jie distance into the plains, and we consider that a general i of the boundary of the reserve to embrace that part of the vhich is marked Z/l on the map would satisfy all suchIThis land we recommend to be added as Class A. It would general advancement of the line by an average distance of aately two miles and embrace approximately 11 square IThe remainder of area Z (i.e. that part of it which is marked ldie map) we recommend to be added as provisional native finder Class B 2 and to be converted progressively into B 1, Iitives clear it of bush in the fly-infested parts and exter-lihe fly.

During our visit to Voi native witnesses complained that ^ Kedai Fibre Estate is diverting water from a stream in the lve Reserve, and that the quantity left in the stream does not tinit of irrigation of native shambas. 1282. At our request the Director of Public Works investigated matter and it was discovered that there were considerable mlarities.   The company&apos;s permit was invalid, the water was g drawn from a stream without any authority at all, and the up any apparently issued orders to the natives not to use the &quot;am for irrigation.L2S3. The Director of Public Works has proposed a settlement ivliich the District Commissioner has agreed.  They consider that proposal will provide an equitable division of water between company and the natives.1281. The Sagalla Native Reserve comprises 82 square miles a population of 3,1)87 persons, giving a density of 48.6 to the ire mile.   In our opinion the reserve is amply sufficient for its ibitants, and no evidence in a contrary sense has been offered.285. Nevertheless an application has been made to extend the Hmlaries to Maungu Station so as to include Maungu Hill in the rve.1286. Thinking that such an extension might possibly offer a iion to the thorny problem of the Easigao, we requested the district Commissioner to investigate the possibilities, and he in-ted the area in company with the agricultural officer for the ;t Province. Their report, which is printed with the evidence, rs clearly that the area between Sagalla and Maungu is water-while Maungu itself has no permanent water supply. It would efore be useless for the Kasigao. They recommend, however, Maungu Hill should be made native reserve, because it includes it proportion of arable land, capable of being developed by ves but unlikely on account of the lack of water to prove attra-for any industrial enterprise.While we accept the report generally, we cannot recommend the area be gazetted native reserve, but we see no objection to ission to cultivate being granted on temporary licence or lease.1287. A small adjustment is necessary on the boundary between Sagalla Native Reserve and the British East Africa&apos; Corpora-estate at Voi, due to the Voi River, which is the gazetted ary, having altered its course during recent years. A give-and-loundary has been agreed upon by all parties, but it cannot zetted as there is no legal machinery to cover the give-and-take.

The history of these reservations is as follows. In Knap the East African Estates, Limited, obtained a lease from the CrcmjB of 250,000 acres, subsequently reduced to 100,000 acres. Under til terms of the Ordinance land in the actual occupation of natives afl the time of the issue of the lease was deemed to be excluded.   H1290. At the request of the East African Estates and icSl general convenience the Surveyor General caused areas to be den marcated to correspond as closely as could be ascertained with th-H areas over which the native rights existed, and they were inclurkl in the gazettement of native reserves in 1926.1291. The boundaries gazetted have not been observed by tlK natives, but they have spread themselves out over much wider areaBf and are cultivating and grazing their goats indiscriminately insidH or outside the reserves according to their individual preference.1292. In such circumstances it would be idle to attempt to givRj population-densities, but it is beyond question that some of thesM reserves, notably Pungu-Mzichenda and Waa-Mzichenda, are km coming very congested. This is not because of natural increase iflj the population but because of the attractive influence exerted bit Mombasa in drawing population from the main reserves into thefl isolated fragments which are in closer proximity to the town.    H1293. The Digo Docal Native Council has submitted a petiti gr to the Governor requesting an extension of these reserves.        FinWe do not consider that any good case can be made out extending them. The fact that Digo natives leave their own (SoirBj Nyika) reserve and crowd into the coast strip provides no adequal Ejj reason for Government to approach the East African Estates with M view to buying any more land for the use of such natives. B&apos;H if the natives of these reserves or any of them wish to obtain! more land, we see no reason why any individual wdro desires :H do so should not negotiate with the East African Estates for H lease, or why any group of such natives should not form tkeuH selves into a corporate body and apply collectively. We do il think that a lease on tribal lines is to be recommended, hecan-H we think that tribal tenure in the coastal strip is already anomaiouH and that the area so occupied should not be extended witln-Mvery good reason.Pie
47THE COAST PROVINCEit II-Chapter XV]Native Reserves1294. There is a piece of commonage, six hundred acres in tent, adjoining the Pungu-Mzichenda Native Reserve. It was Served originally as grazing commonage and as land where natives ght gather palm leaves for making baskets, but huts have now len built on it and it is being treated by the natives as if it were Jive reserve for all purposes.1295. There seems to be some difference of opinion between theCommonage adjoining tho Pungu-Mzichenda Reserve.Jnguid&quot;natives and the natives living at Likoni as to whether theis reserved more especially for the one group or the other, and i are at present using it.  Since all are Digo natives, we recom-(na that the laud be included in the Pungu-Mzichenda Native reserve, which is part of the Digo country although detached from main block.   The question of private rights in it should be [tied in accordance with native law and custom, the Provincial Inmissioner taking such administrative steps as may be necessary afegiiard the interests of the Likoni people.1296. This recommendation may appear to be at variance with other recommendation which we have made, namely, that native rves in the coastal strip should not be extended without good jse. But we consider that in this case good cause exists, since the jarecommended to be added is already, to all intents and purposes, live reserve, and it is advisable that the position should be regu-zed in this manner.1297. The plains between the Pokomo country to the west of The Galla. Tana River are inhabited by Galla tribes who originally came In Abyssinia.  These Galla, though once numerous, are now only le five or six thousand strong and are nomadic pastoralists. They jin over the whole of these plains as far as the borders of the ni District.  Although this area is loosely known as Galia cotm-no reserve has been set apart for their use.   Since the density Ivhicli they inhabit the land is under one to the square mile, it Id not be practicable to make a reserve for them, but we recom-ld that this land should be treated on the same footing as we e.  recommended   for   the   Northern   Frontier   Province   and1298. We have now concluded our examination of the specific ims of the various native reserves of the Coast Province. There other claim in respect of the coast hinterland which ought aps to be mentioned, if only because of the trouble to which pplicant has put himself in presenting his case. After tracing lliistory of his tribe, the Wakwavi, for some two hundred years ho applicant, one Mahommed bin Uweki Shoo, comes to the \i of his narrative, which is that he himself, though born as a son the Coast, is actually the heir of the chief of the tribe, and Ikiims in his own right all the land over which the tribe is allegedThe Claim of Mohommed bin TJweki Shoo.

Tin; includes a large part of the Masai and Kamba Reserves, the whole) of the Taveta, Dabida and Sagalla Reserves, most of the South Nyiljjl Reserve, the whole of Kilimanjaro and the Chagga country and Moshi. The claimant himself admits that the tribe had already lost its power and nearly the whole of its territory before the Britisli Government appeared; his father had been deposed by a rival head man and his mother had been sold as a slave.The story, which stands at pp. 2540-2551 of the Evidence, J not without interest as a narrative, but the claim is clearly in] supportable and it is amazing that it should have been seriously put forward. It illustrates the complete inability, which we have noticed in several places, to distinguish between a claim to have exercised sovereign power and a claim to the proprietorship of land1299. We recommend that all the native reserves of the Goastl Province, with the exception of the North Pokomo Native Reserve be proclaimed collectively as one reserve to be known as the Coasj Province Native Reserve, although the component units are terril torially disconnected.   The object of this recommendation is facilitate interpenetration between tribes and generally to permit more freedom of movement in whatever direction economic advaii tags may suggest. The rights of occupant tribes would be adequateli safeguarded.  Land tenure among each tribe and the recognition o: private rights in land would be based upon native law and custom as it is or may become, modified by natural process or by rule; ant each administrative district would have its own local land board.1300. The argument in favour of combining the native reserve! into fewer and larger units will be more fully discussed in the thirl part of the Report.
478CHAPTER XVI.THE COAST PROVINCE.(b) The Ten Mile Strip. 180.1. We have not, fortunately, to deal with all the land prob-ms of the Coast belt, but only with such as either fall directly ithin our terms of reference or which have to be reviewed because ey might in some way affect or qualify our general recom-endations.1302. A conception which will be found to underlie and per-riite the whole of our Report is that the land in the Colony can considered in the following classes : land to be occupied tribally natives as native lands, or as native reserves, or as land held nerally for native tribes (e.g. Turkana); secondly, land in which nropeans have a special privilege (the European Highlands) ; irdly, land to be set apart for alienation on lease primarily to lives (native leasehold areas); and lastly the residue.1303. In respect of the residue we are making the general ummendation, as we have already stated in section 25 of the port and shall state again in more detail below (section 1471), at there should be no racial restrictions. By far the most im-rtant area to which this recommendation would apply is the ast, and it is necessary to consider how7 far the position is already :npromised, and whether perhaps some modification may be neces-ry in our recommendation in order to bring it into more practical iation with existing facts.1304. In so far as existing titles are concerned there are only few points in which the question of racial privilege might be :med to arise : (1) We are informed that there are a few leases issued to Europeans on Afombasa Island with restrictive clauses against non-Europeans. Our general recommendation made above should not be read as prejudicing this issue or similar issues in any manner whatever.(2) Large areas of land were granted to the Mazrui Arabs originally as blocks of land vested in the Mazrui lands trust board. Although this arrangement originally created a racial privilege over a large extent of the Coast in favour of Afazrui Arabs, practically the whole of these lands have now passed into the private ownership of individual Arabs, who are en-titled to sell or lease them without distinction of race.Scope of the-Chapter.A General Recommenda-tion that no Racial Privilege should apply.Exceptions or Special Oases.
THE COAST PROVINCE part II-Chapter XVI] Native Rbbkuvks(3) There are some areas, even outside the native reserves where a special native privilege applies. Such are Pumwani, Mijomboni, Mida, Tezo, Mavueni, and Miritini, comprisino altogether 13,698 acres.   These cases will be reviewed below&quot;(4) At Mpekatoui, south-west of Lamu, there is a special reserve for the Arab and Swahili people of Lamu, 5,600 acres in extent.  There is also the Arab and African Reserve at Wassin.(5) There are certain commonages near Mombasa, the Likoni and other commonages, the original intention of which appears from the contemporary records to have been that they should be reserved exclusively for native use.1305. The above list shows instances in which some degree of racial qualification is discernible. The list is probably not exhaus-tive, but, especially having regard to the fact that a Coast Land Titles Committee is now sitting, we do not conceive that more is required of us than that we should make clear our general attitude in matters where some point of principle is involved. No more need be written regarding the other categories in the list, but some observations are required in regard to Nos. 3, 4 and 5, namely, the six special native reserves, the Mpekatoni and Wassin Arab and African communal reserves, and the Likoni commonage.t1306. The six special reserves comprise one reserve for ex-slaves, one for Mahaji or converts to Islam, and four for detribalized natives.The Tezo 1307. The present position iii regard to the Tezo ex-slaveReserve0 reserve is that large numbers of Nyika natives have drifted into itand are inhabiting it exactly as if it were part of their own native reserve, while the ex-slaves are a dying and dwindling population. Such descendants as they may have will not desire a perpetual reminder of their origin or wish to be surrounded exclusively by other ex-slaves or their descendants, and no objection to the incur-sion of the Nyika has been raised. On the other hand the position ought to be regularized, and we do not think that Government should acquiesce in what is virtually an unauthorized extension by the Nyika of their reserve.1308. We recommend that, when opportunity permits, private leasehold title should be issued to the occupants either individually or on group tenure such as we shall recommend for native lease-hold areas in a later part of our Report (sections 1880-1935 below). We consider that there should be special clauses to regulate sucees-sion, and that there should be no restrictions on transfer between races.
479Let II-Chapter XVI]THE COAST PROVINCENative ReservesThe Mahaji Reserve at Mida.The Four Reserves for Detribalized Natives.1309. The reserve at Mida was declared to be for the benefit ofIlahaji or converts to Islam, but a reservation exclusively to that lass can hardly have been contemplated, and has certainly never een attempted.   The Mida Reserve is, in effect, practically in-inguishable from a native reserve except that most  of the Inhabitants are Mohammedans. We recommend the issue of private .sehold titles with no restrictions on transfer between races. 1310. The  reserves  for  detribalized  natives   at  Pumwani, llijomboni, Mavueni, and Miritini comprise 11,177 acres.   There s no accepted test of detribalization and in practice any native is jllowed to go and live in these areas, which are, in effect, com-unal reserves.   The perpetuation of such a form of tenure is atiy not advisable on the Coast, and we recommend that the [resent residents be granted private leasehold title to land sufficient their needs.  If there is a residue of land left over, we recom-lend, in view of the purpose for which the land was originally nted that it be leased to suitable applicants who are detribalized ntives, but that there be no restriction on. transfer, which should allowed irrespectively of race or class.1311. In 1925, 5,600 acres of land were set aside at Mpekatoni ar Lamu in order that leases might be issued to the &quot;people of ,unu, Arab and Swahili&quot; at the discretion of the District Com-dssioner. No lease or licence has in fact been issued, and we commend that the reservation now cease.1312. The extent of the Wassin Arab and African communal The Wassintserve is 46 square miles, and the circumstances of its creation are African&quot;1 follows : According to tradition the first Arab pioneers arrived Communal Wassin Island under the leadership of one, Seyid Sheikh, about Reserve-ren generations ago.  At first they cultivated only on this island it later extended their farms to the Shimoni peninsula, where ey found a small tribe of up-country people already settled. This ibe, known locally as the Segeju, is said to be of Kikuyu origin.of their members have embraced Islam and considerable inter-Jamage with the Arabs has taken place.1313. In 1926 the Provincial Commissioner and the District immissioner, Digo, evolved the idea of a communal reserve in aich the Arabs and Segeju could reside and farm in perpetuity, teir recommendation was accepted by Government and the reserve is gazetted in December, 1929.1314. In view of certain complaints Mr. Justice Dickinson was Dinted a Commissioner to hold a judicial inquiry and recom-JJtnded that within the area of the communal reserve the ArabThe Mpekatoni and Wassin Reservations.
THE COAST PROVINCE Part II Chapter XVI] Native Resehviclaimants should be permitted to bring their individual claims f( registration of their homes and farms before the Recorder of Title: and he added : &quot;It appears to me that, if the communal reserve is prf served for the whole area, and the individual properties of th Arabs, which are adjudicated in their favour, are delimited on of it, no injury will occur to the Arabs&apos; neighbours, whilst a the same time the Arab rights which they bave acquired wi be protected by registration.&quot;1315. The position would appear to be that when the in dividual homesteads of the Arab claimants have been defined an excluded from the area, the reserve will be a common.1316. We do not. wish to make any criticism of the genera policy of the Arab and African communal reserve. The experiniet was made on the recommendation of the provincial administrate, and must be given a chance of success, however slender it ma appear. But we recommend strongly that the communal nature t the reservation should not be so interpreted as to preclude tl. creation and recognition of private rights. We have recommende in respect of the native reserves up-country that an advance to more private form of tenure ought to be encouraged. In the absent of such rights not only is a proper economic development impossible but the soil will inevitably suffer deterioration through misuse. Tf conception of a native reserve as a &quot;common&quot; has already becorr. an anachronism among the more advanced of the up-country tribe.-and should certainly not be tolerated on the Coast among people who claim to have reached a more advanced degree of civilizatior1317. We recommend therefore that, as opportunity occur an equitable scheme should be formulated by which the land shook&apos; in process of time, pass into private ownership. It may be four, necessary at first, for protective purposes, to restrict the issues ( titles and the transfer of holdings to Wassin Arabs and Sege; only, but iu course of time the need for this restriction shod disappear aud transfer be permitted without restriction of race ( tribe.The Likoni 1318.

The next development wa that most of them sold their land, in some cases to natives and i: others to non-natives, and opinions differ as to who are the persor who now have rights on the commonage.   The point has beej

Since some degree of racial privilege exists in the above Comment on and since we propose no immediate or drastic reversal of icy, it follows that our general recommendation that there should no racial discrimination on the Coast in respect of the holding 1 transfer of land must be qualified in a certain degree. But &apos;se areas are so small in comparison to the whole Coast that they aid not affect its validity as a general principle.1320. There are however a few claims which, if admitted. %uld modify the situation profoundly.   These are such communal ins as those of the twelve tribes and of the Lamu Arabs.1321. Memoranda have been submitted on behalf of the &quot;Three ibes&quot; and on behalf of the &quot;Twelve Tribes&quot;, which actually in-de nine other tribes and the three tribes. These are the remnants ncient immigrant tribes who came to the country around Miibasa at some date before the later historical wave of Arab im-ration. Their claims will be found at pp. 2561-2567, 2573-2578 the printed evidence, and amount to a request that this Commis-should recommend to Government &quot;that existing Crown lands mainland south be established as communal reserve land for the ee tribes and the agricultural lands on mainland north be alien-d to the nine tribes in the same way.&quot; The context makes clear It the claim to the north extends from Mombasa to Takaungu also embraces the ancient settlements of Ivilifi, Gedde, and lindi; the claim to the south is understood to extend as far as i, the total of both claims being approximately forty miles by miles.1322. In 1914 the Mombasa-Takaungu block and the Mombasa-d block were gazetted as areas in respect of which all land claims st be submitted for adjudication within six months. The claim question was not submitted, possibly because a claim by the ree Tribes to land on Mombasa Island had already been adjudi-;d by the Recorder of Titles and had been rejected, a judgment eh had subsequently been upheld by the Court of Appeal (Law orts, Vol. V, 1913-1914). Whether this was the reason or not, ilaim to land on the mainland was made on behalf either of the ee Tribes or the Nine Tribes or the two in combination. It is now competent for the applicants to submit it except as a late n cognizable at the discretion of the Governor in Council. We no reason to recommend that such discretion be exercised.1323. It appeared to us necessary to speak plainly to these [le, and, after we had heard the evidence of Khamis Mohamed

The Area under Claim.Dates at which Applications were made.bin Hamis and Sudi bin Ali Bashir, the two representatives of 1 Afro-Asian Association, who appeared before us in support of tl, claim, the Chairman made the following announcement : &quot;It seems to us that this is really a claim that you at sovereigns of the country and that the Sultan of Zanzibar In no claim to it, and that the rights he gave to the Governmer were not of any value.&quot;&quot;It is quite clear that the individuals and villages who co sidered they had claims have put forward their claims, whit have been listened to by the Court whose decision was obtaine and they had the right of appeal to the High Court and also t the Privy Council. This is merely a claim that we shou! recognize you as the rulers of this part of the country and Sultan&apos;s flag should be pulled down . . .&quot;&quot;It seems to me that you have had a very good opportune of putting forward all your claims and having them careful considered. There is no reason and no right on our part to. behind the decision of these Courts.&quot;1324. The three Arab tribes of Lamu, known as the Yum Fainao, and Kinamite, in association with the Arab tribes of Shell Matondoni, and Kipungani and the Swahili people of Lamu Islau, have addressed to us a joint memorandum laying claim to some 21 square miles of territory lying wholly within the area former known as the with Sultanate. The claimants, of whom none live i the area claimed, are willing to admit a reservation of rights i favour of the freed slaves and other persons who are resident ilia to the number of about 2,546 (the figure given by the Senior Con missioner in 1924). The total number of adult male Arabs in 19: was 28S according to the Poll Tax register, so that the claim worl out roughly at a square mile each, even if all the Arabs of Lam are associated in the claim.1325. The land which they claim is land on which they hat never lived and never intend to live; but they claim that the formerly cultivated it by means of slave labour.1326. The Lands Titles Ordinance was applied to the Wit Sultanate in 1915 and opportunity was given to all persons to loth claims to any rights in the land which they might believe themselve to have. With few exceptions, those Arabs who had shambas thei lodged their claims, which were duly adjudicated. No common: claim was made until 1919, when the period allowed for the lodgia of claims had already expired.1327. On being informed that this claim was late, the applicant] asked leave to file it out of-&apos;time.   This request being refused the Acting Land Officer, &apos;they addressed a petition to the Aetinj
481THE COAST PROVINCE U-Chapter XVI] Native Reservesornor in August, 1919, and sanction was given for late applica-gjns to be filed.  But it appears that, in fact, no communal claim filed, the Provincial Commissioner having.given orders that i separate claim must be supported by a separate affidavit.I32S. It would hardly seem from the records that the Arabs d have any cause of complaint in this regard, since Mr. Isaac, nncial Commissioner, has left it on record that at one time he jered to treat with these Arabs on communal lines, and they refused ie ground that &quot;everyone owned their shambas and there was joint tenure.&quot;  Moreover, on a subsequent inquiry held belore Provincial Commissioner in 1924, the Chief Kathi gave his Biiiion that communal rights could not be claimed but that &quot;all t could be claimed would be the shambas actually cultivated by ividuals and with definite boundaries.&quot; 1329. Whatever the reason may be no claim on communal lines in fact lodged with the Recorder of Titles in 1919. 1330. The next date of significance is 1921.   In July of that a Government notice was published in the Official Gazette .   .mg that all applications for land west of Lamu and north of the n Sultanate must be made within six months from August, I. The District Commissioner rightly informed the applicants the notice did not refer to them, the land under claim being lin the with Sultanate and not north of it.1331. Two years later (July, 1923) the claimants sent a further alion to the Governor claiming that the District Commissioner Departmental-InquiryI advised them wrongly in 1921. The Governor then ruled that [land in question should not be alienated by grant or concession, fce the Arabs were wrongly informed that they need not submitits.&apos;1332. This resulted in the Provincial Commissioner, Coast, the Mr. A. J. Maclean, being instructed to hold a departmental luiry. Plis finding has been printed with the evidence (pp. 2623-5) and was recorded in his letter &quot;No. 1425 of 25th September, Jf. iu which the following passage occurs : &quot;Asked as to why, in view of the arguments made, they did not apply for title to this land as tribal or communal land at the same time as they lodged their individual claims, they -ileaded ignorance, but stated that as soon as they found out heir mistake they had never ceased to petition each Governor I in turn.&quot;I alleged ignorance is hard to reconcile with the statement which lliave quoted by Mr. Isaac.
THE COAST PROVINCERam; II-Chapter XVI]Native ReservesArgument regarding JLate Admis-sion of Claim.1333. The letter proceeds, a little later: &quot;The District Coin-inissioner was perfectly correct in informing the claimants that the notice in the gazette referred to (i.e. Government Notice 841 of 1921) did not affect the claims to any land within the Sultanate of with . . . The claimants therefore were not wrongly informed, and consequently such information cannot be used as the basis of an excuse for not lodging applications in time. As I have previous shown, the Land Titles Ordinance was applied to the Sultanate of with in 1915 and it was not until four years later that the claimants prepared their claim.&quot; In my opinion the applicants can prove no legal or moral rights over the land claimed and no case has been made out for the consideration of their claims under section 17 (2) of the Land Titles Ordinance, 1908, by His Excellency the Governor in Council. This opinion is borne out by every officer who has in the past dealt with this claim. I advocate, however, that a portion of the land referred to should be set apart as a reserve for the people of Lamu for cultivation purposes. By people of Lamu I include all classes and not any particular family or tribe.&quot;1334. The point for our decision is whether we ought to recom-mend that the Governors sanction should be given for the admission of this application out of time for adjudication in the Land Titles Court. Such a course could be justified either on formal grounds if it could be shown that for some cause, such as wrong advice given by a District Commissioner, the claimants have not had a proper opportunity of presenting their claim; or on general grounds of equity, if we considered that the grounds of the claim were so strong as to demand consideration, even though the time for making claims is past.1335. We consider that the Provincial Commissioner&apos;s inquiry disposes of the first point, and. we cannot find any cause for sop-posing that the applicants did not have ample opportunity of presenting their claim at the proper time, if they had desired to do so. It is moreover noteworthy that the present claim is not the same as that which was put forward in 1919 and 1923 and before the Provincial Commissioner in 1924. That claim was by the Lamu Arab tribes only and w7as opposed before the Provincial Commis sioner by the Arabs of Sheila, who are nowr associated with tht claimants in the present claim, which has now been presented fo the first time in this form, a matter of eighteen years too late.1336. On grounds of equity after a careful perusal of the evidence before us, we cannot find any ground for recommending that the application be entertained.   Those individuals who had shamba claims brought them and had them adjudicated, and if tlier are still any shamba claims which have not yet been brought r have not yet been adjudicated we recommend that late application
482THE COAST PROVINCELit 11-Ohaptkh XVI]Native Reservesiionld be allowed and that the claims should be finally heard and Itennined.   But this communal claim does not only comprise all individual claims but extends also over all the bush and waste nil making an area of 275 square miles.   This we hold to be at i disposal of the Crown.  This communal claim could have beenlieeule in 1915, but was not made, and we see no reason for recom-iding that it should be entertained at this date. 1337. We have already dealt, in section 1311 above, with the -commendation made by Mr. Maclean in the last paragraph of his uling.1338. it is certain that other claims to land on the Coast, both ^&quot;sr Claims1dividual and communal, will be lodged, and there are many such 01 liius which await adjudication. There are some areas where claims ,ve been adjudicated and other areas where they have not, and it iccessary to make the position clear by a short description of the iid Titles Ordinance and the action which has been taken IhIt it.1339. In 1908, with the two-fold object of securing the rights of &apos;rJjo ate owners and of determining the position and extent of Crown Ordinance, lid, the Land Titles Ordinance was enacted. This Ordinance set i Land Titles Court to hear land claims and to issue freehold les. The period within which claims might be lodged was limited all land unclaimed at the expiry of that period was declared own land, with a provision that late claims to portions of such own land were to be admissible under certain conditions. The (finance was applicable by proclamation to any area and has in applied at various times to the whole Coastal strip.1340. The survey and adjudication of claims proceeded con-uously, first in Mombasa District and then further afield, and by 2-1 practically all claims had been adjudicated in Mombasa Island id District; in the area between Mombasa District and Takaungu, jpept Takaungu township; in the area between Kilifi and the I.r.a. river, except Malindi township; in the area about the uth of the Tana River; and in the with Sultanate. The work of udication was proceeding north of the Sabaki River and at Lamu, claims south of Mombasa in Digo District had not yet been died.1341. In that year the economic situation necessitated the eessa-of Coast title work then in progress, and it has not been Jsible to resume it since except on a much reduced scale. We are so much impressed with the necessity of finding out e and for all what lands are at the disposal of the Crown and it lands are private, that we recommend that the Office of ;order of Titles be resumed, and that the work of adjudication mid proceed energetically.
THE COAST PROVINCE.PaKT II-ClIAlTKI!  XVI]Native RbskuviReoommeuda-tions regarding Communal Claims, and Communal Tenure ponerally.1343. Onr general recommendation in regard to comrniuia claims is that they should not be admitted for adjudication ow oflf time in areas in which the adjudication of claims has already boerjl completed, but that in areas still awaiting adjudication communal applications should be admissible on the same footing as pri\ claims and should be entitled to the same consideration.1344. In the case of waste or public lands which are at disposal of the Crown by virtue of the Agreement dated J tt]l December, 1895, between Great Britain and Zanzibar, we recoinj mend that communal reserves, being generally uneconomic, shoal not be created unless very special reasons exist.   We would noti however, debar the possibility of leases of land on group or fai tenure, provided that a clear method of inheritance and succession exists, and that adequate safeguards are jirovided against the laiij becoming excessively sub-divided or fragmented.1345. While most of the natives living on the Coast belon: tribes in the hinterland for which reserves have been proclaimed! there are some, especially the descendants of imported slaves, whi have no such reserves in Kenya.  They are truly detribalized live, for the most part, as tenants on Crown or private land or irfl the six sjjecial &quot;reserves&quot; to which we have already  referred. Thej most practical form of assistance which can be given to such native! is not the creation of reserves, but the safeguarding of the right tenants, where such safeguards are found to be necessary, and thl simplification of the procedure for the acquisition and transfer land, so that the cost of acquiring small private holdings may not hi unduly swelled by charges for survey and registration.The Bajun, however, are a special case. They inhabit princij pally the mainland to the north of Damu, and to some extent ma; be said to be living in a tribal condition, although they have n reserve of their own. At present they have plenty of land to cult vate and it hardly seems likely that any practical difficulty will avis for many years. In these circumstances we need make no more definite recommendation than that the administrative officers con cerned should study the position which will become clearer wlie private claims in this area have been adjudicated and it is know wdiat land is at the disposal of the Crown. As in other parts of th Coast we consider that the end in view should be the emergent&quot;.: a regularized, though not elaborate, system of private tenure eithtj on individual or group lines, but with a clear method of successiori We are satisfied that the perpetuation of tribal conditions on til Coast is undesirable and would be detrimental to progress.
THE COAST PROVINCE [part II-Chapter XVI] Native Reserves1.348. Our recommendation regarding private claims is that the recommendations  -kvork of adjudication be pushed forward. Whether or not the present pr?vatoSclaims [Land Titles Ordinance should first be amended is a matter which and Private jnrc leave&apos;in the hands of the Coast Land Titles Committee which is &apos;5,?&quot;&quot;rlaiiy io\v sitting.   There is certainly room for criticism of the present Irdinanco on the grounds that the value of private lands in remote *as is not such as to justify the elaborate and expensive machinery ivided to govern such matters as the issue of private title or the ninsfer or succession of property.   The cost of survey alone is ftroliibifcive.1347. It is clear to us that the work of registering small private ims is necessarily expensive,-and will not be worth the money if ithiu a few years of the issue of the title the land becomes sub-iivided into minute fragments through inheritance. Experience on Tana -River suggests that in the course of a generation some Boldings become hopelessly complicated in respect of the determina-jion of the shares of co-heirs, a condition of affairs which is exceed-gly detrimental to successful cultivation.  In various parts of our port we have occasion to allude to the dangers of uneconomic ibdivision and fragmentation, and these are matters which we ould especially commend to the attention of the Committee.  In u&apos; opinion this is a.question which cannot be shelved, but, after a iod of preliminary study, regulations ought to be made and nforced. In land which is at the disposal of the Crown, as apart oin land which may be claimed as of right, we recommend that lease should be granted without adequate safeguards against inthorized subdivision.Whether private tenure for natives should be conceived prefer- *    -(ily on the lines of individual tenure or of group or family tenure      -.   &apos;matter for special study.

There are at present very few natives who hold land oj titie, but our recommendations that on the Coast generally native should have the same rights as other races to take up land introduce: no new principle. The facility already exists, and it is reasonabli to suppose that, as the natives advance in civilization, they will b, more ready to avail themselves of it.1351. The great mass of the natives on the Coast are not livin on their own land or on land especially reserved to them, but ar&apos; simply occupying land on sufferance where they can find a place am where nobody objects. Some of this land is Crown land, some private, land, and some is hind awaiting adjudication.1352. The Arab and other owners of private land follow tit usual Afahommedan and local custom of &quot;lending&quot; their land t, native tenants for cultivation or building purposes; and near tli towns and villages the land is kept under close cultivation by thi means. Such tenancy is terminable at will, but the native tenan is entitled to reap his crop and remove the material of his house.1353. The present position on the mainland is satisfactory because as a general rule the relation between landlord and tenan is on a sentimental rather than a commercial basis. Many ex-slave and freedmen of Arab landlords continue to live on the estates i their late masters, and a sense of protection on the one hand and( obligation on the other still subsists to some extent. But the tenac is liable to be turned off at any time without compensation afte reaping his crop. We have found this condition of affairs to I unsatisfactory in parts of Kikuyu, and we suspect that it will ah prove unsatisfactory on the Coast, when industrialization and ft density of population increase.1354. Very few natives own land in Mombasa Island, but thet are large numbers who own houses. Most of these are built on lat owned by Arabs. In the absence of special conditions to the cot trary in a written agreement the tenant is regarded, i Mohammedan law, as the absolute owner of his building as distim from the land on which it stands. It is not customary to charge rent for the right of occupation; upon receiving notice to quit tt tenant has the right to remove his house but is not entitled i compensation. The tenant-owner of a house may, and frequenti does, mortgage or sell his house, the tenancy of the land bein transferred to the purchaser in case of sale. Deeds recordic mortgages or sales are generally prepared in Arabic and are regi; tered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance.1355. Native houses in Mombasa are not confined to Ian owned by Arabs, but in some cases have been built on land owne

After the Town Planning Scheme had been enacted in 26 rapid development of the island followed, and it became neces-n to consider housing schemes for natives.1357. Development on the lines of a native location on Govern-ent land was impracticable, both for financial reasons and other uses. A plot at Makupa had been set aside for such a purpose, it it was soon discovered that natives preferred to make their own angements, and the scheme to form a native location was allowed lapse.1358. The problem which then confronted the Town Planning thority was how adequate housing for natives could be provided, isential conditions to be fulfilled were that the scheme should not II for a heavy Government subsidy and so pauperize the natives; it the natives should be encouraged to build and own their own uses; that the houses must be up to a standard which would tisfy the Health Authority without being beyond the resources of e native; that the terms to the landlord should be sufficiently ractive, so that land would be available; and finally that the ituneration which the landlord should receive by way of rentaid not be more than the native could reasonably be expectedpay-1359. The solution found was a standard pattern lay-out, pro-ing sub-plots for native houses, which were required to be con-icted in accordance with a standard design. A certain degree latitude was allowed to avoid excessive uniformity and prevent dship, and the lay-outs were designed to allow of open spaces and i)tiate access. It is a condition of approval of such village lay-s that the landowner shall not sell any sub-plot or sub-lease it a period exceeding a year.1360. The solution has proved acceptable to the landowners ohave no particular desire to sell or lease for long periods, realiz-that in present circumstances tenancy at will gives an immediate adequate return, and that such tenancy can be terminated when-tniore advantageous methods of disposing of their land present mselves.1361. One may be disposed to doubt whether the system is illy satisfactory to the tenant.  It may seem a harsh provision

On the other hand it has to be remembered that na in &quot;Mombasa are not forced to take up these sub-plots.

In view of all these alterm it is some tribute to the success of the scheme that these sub-are beinu&apos; freely taken up, and many standard pattern bouses been built, especially in the area between Makupa road anc railway.1363. In all the circumstances we consider that the am ments made for the housing of the native po2ruIation at most are satisfactory at present. There has, of necessity, to be an ele of. impermanence in any such scheme, because, if the town f Its promise of growth there is every indication that the operat&apos; economic laws will force the less well-to-do element of the pc tion, of-.whatever race, to seek houses on the mainland wher ground-rents will be less high. It is necessary to bear in mind the island only contains some three thousand odd acres... But although the present position may be accounted satisfa it is probable that additional security for tenants will be req as industrialization increases. While we understand that at pr :the arrangements are mutually satisfactory to landlord and te and that very few evictions take place, it is conceivable tl sudden large increase in land values would cause a profound eh; We therefore recommend a caref ^&quot;investigation of the position a. view to ascertaining whether additional security for tenai required, and, if so, on wdiat lines it could be provided.Lodging 1-364.

One of the most striking features of the Coast, especially Bistojbution[lie neighbourhood of Mombasa, is the ease with which a com-tjanitively dense population distributes itself.  This is the more re-aarkable in view of the high percentage which must be accounted i floating population, including some thousands of natives engaged temporarily on contracts and an almost equally large number of Kibarua or day-labourers.   It is a most remarkable circumstance that the population, composed in a great measure of detribaUzed Natives is able to come and go with so little disturbance.

PART iii the PROBLEMS COMPREHENSIVELY CONSIDERED
CHAPTEE I.THE GENERAL CONDITIONS OBTAINING IN THE NATIVE DESERVES IN RESPECT OE THE USE OE LAND.1368. A large proportion of our Report hitherto has been Purpose of tl toted to  describing  the  conditions in  the  individual native     aPter-[ewes of each province. But at this stage we think that it will be idvantage to offer a general survey of somewhat wider scope, ocommendations, both general and particular, will then be in proper perspective in the relation which they bear to the lem as a whole.1369. It is obvious that we cannot usefully make recommenda- Present and&apos; s concerning the present and future needs of the natives, unless *ttture -Nc&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; irst make clear how they use the land which they have already, what are the general conditions obtaining in the reserves in sect of the density and distribution of the population, the degree attainment in agricultural and pastoral skill, and the problems are arising in respect of the tenure of land.. Here and there, kissing, we shall make suggestions for amelioration, but a com-Sieasive statement of our recommendations regarding tribal lands the manner in which they should be held and used will be Jervcd for discussion in the chapter which follows.1370. All the evidence before us points to a high rate of p**yj^;on, ease among the native population, and we cannot discern any i^crease?^ reason for expecting any slackening of the rate within the two decades.  It appears more likely that it will increase as atilt of the improved conditions of life.  It has been suggested to fiat the later marriages, which may be expected to occur as a of mission teaching, and possibly also as a concomitant of a flier standard of life, may cause decline in the rate of increase, having regard to the fact that at present marriages commonlyInr before the age of maturity is fully reached, we are not con-ted that a retardation by- a year or two, which is all that can be tected, would have that result. For any decrease wdiich there be in the birth-rate will probably- be more than counteracted m increase in the survival-rate both among children and among&apos; Ithers.1371. Since it appears that the population is likely to go on Need for [teasing rapidly, and since there are practical limits to the exten- gtj[fase* lof boundaries, the necessity is clear for a policy and programme Idi will aim at an increase of skill in the use of land, so that Isame land can be made to support a larger population.  This

The need for a better distribution and the difficulty accomplishing it will at once be apparent from the following figure of areas and distribution, which are based on the Surveyor General&apos; analysis dated 31st December, 1932, and the Chief Native commissioners sioner&apos;s estimate of population for the same year, as shown in hi circular of 2nd June, 1933. The official figures do not always sped fy, in the case of mixed districts, how many of the populatio: reside in the fiative reserve and how many in the settled ares Where official returns have been incomplete in this respect, on calculation has been based on other evidence, and particularly tli, memoranda submitted to us by District Commissioners.1373. The official estimate for the total native population 3,007,645.   The total area of the Colony is 219,730 square mikj (exclusive of water area), and the density over all is therefore little under 14 to the square mile. But the distribution is extreme! uneven.1374. Nearly two-thirds of tire total area is inhabited at average density of less than one to the square mile. The total are, of unsurveyed Crown land in the Northern Frontier Province, Tin kana, the &quot;Extension from Uganda&quot;, and the parts of the Kim and Tana Biver Districts which are not native reserves, amount: to 138,942 square miles, or 63 per cent of the whole, and then are considerable uninhabited stretches in other parts of the Colouv None of the above areas are included in the native reserves.1375. The native reserves are 48,149 square miles, or appiuvij mately 22 per cent of the whole area of the Colony.   The nativj population inhabiting them is approximately 2,587,000, or 86 p cent of the whole, and the density is 54 to the square mile.1376. Of this area, the three Ivikuyu and the three KavirondiJ districts comprise between them 8,856 square miles. The popul; tion is 1,518,578, or approximately half the entire population of thj country, living in two areas the total of which is approximate!; one twenty-fifth part of the whole land of the country. Sucli statement is apt to be misleading unless all the factors are takei into account, and it is a juster comparison to compare these area with the rest of the gazetted reserves. It is then found thai lit-three Kavirondo and the three Kikuyu reserves comprise 18 pei
488ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES ,i III-Chapter I]t of the whole area of the native reserves; their population coni-cs 50 per cent of the whole native reserve population, and the jsity is 171 to the square mile, as against an average of 27 for rest of the reserves.Pi77. The greatest contrast to be found between neighbouring ies is the case of the Kikuyu and the Masai. The area of the ei- Kikuyu reserves as gazetted (i.e. without Mwea) is 1,726 arc mites, inhabited at an average density of 283 to the square while Masai, as gazetted, is 11,797 square miles, inhabited at average density of 3 to the square mile. And yet the Masai uitry contains very extensive areas of good arable land as well enormous areas of pasture.1378. The remainder of the Colony is 32,039 square miles. The (&quot;0- The ive population inhabiting it is approximately 296,000, and the ^\01^ til0r sity 9 to the square mile.   This land comprises : Square Miles.Alienated land        ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   10,3451,530 4,284 15,649 273 558Surveyed for alienation Forest reserves       ...      ...Crown land unsurveyed Coast freeholdReserves for townships and other public purposes 1379. When every allowance has been made for differences in Causes of the-ility and other factors which affect the matter, the conclusion autributfon1&quot; ot be avoided that a notable degree of maldistribution exists, say this is not to impute any blame.   Government, generally king, set tribal boundaries around the areas where the tribes e found, and few of them have legitimate complaint on the e of constriction.   But the mere fixation of boundaries and prevention of inter-tribal wars, necessary actions though they i, have had the effect of introducing rigid barriers winch had arallel in native experience. In former times, a powerful tribe able to amass much live stock and roam over a wide territory, -ten. also would be won in raids and would help to recruit the gth of the tribe.    When a change of fortune came and its er started to decline, it would be liable to lose its cattle or tof them through the attacks of more powerful neighbours, who obtained not only upon live stock but on women also, and under ss the tribe would find it prudent to constrict its boundaries, his rough-and-ready method, the stock and the land and the lation were redistributed.380. But with the immunity conferred by the protection of latent; vast herds of live stock have grown up behind the frontiers, and the human population is also increasing.   And

Drastic remedies for securing a better distribution an not open to us. To take surplus territory from one tribe and gin it to another tribe is a step only justifiable in extremities, whie] have not arisen and may never arise. To effect a similar result a process of inter-tribal lease may be more practicable, and v, would not rule it out its a method should circumstances ever requiij it. But if carried out without the goodwill of both tribes, it migl cause an estrangement between them and tend to prevent peace! interpenetrattou. It is therefore a method requiring great catitioi in its application. Leases of extension areas outside the resent are also a possibility for which we have provided.13S2. But the possibilities of a tribe extending its territory! lease of contiguous land are very limited.  While inter-tribal lease] would be difficult to negotiate, leases in other areas would often ruled out by the consideration that there is no contiguous unalier] ated Crown land available.1383. In its Report the Hilton-Young Commission lias state!(page 347) in connexion with- the question of land being taken fro:one tribe and added to another : &quot; The decision to be taken in such case would be a matti of first class importance, demanding the direct consideration! Government, which could not- divest itself of sole responsibility and it does not seem fitting that the Government should del gate the authority for such a purpose to a Board of the natu which it is proposed to set up under the Bill.&quot;1384. We concur with the above opinion and consider tk the trust vested in the Board should relate to the integrity of ti native lands as a whole. Tribal frontiers inside proclaimed natit reserves would be the concern of Government. Adequate secmit; both to the tribe at large and to the right-holders in particuh would be found by a provision that the system of land tenure i any tribal area should be built up on the basis of its own natii customs.&apos; 1385. The following passage from Professor E. H. Brooke History of Native Policy in South Africa (page 57) is apposite :-&quot; The ten years after the Report of the Commission ( 1852-53 were devoted mainly to quiet administration. Bi steps were being taken . . . towards the legal securing of tl Location Lands to the tribes inhabiting them. The fir scheme . . . was the granting of separate titles for each trill
48ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES ,,t III-Chapter I]location, the land to be alienated by the Crown to separate hoards of trustees. Such a trust was created by indenture of the 27th May, 1858, in respect of the tribe (the Ainatuli) occu-jiying the Umnini location : under the name of the Umnini Trust it still exists. . . . But on maturer consideration it was decided not to proceed with the scheme, which would have taken from Government the power of reallocating land between tribes.&quot;1386. It is with the same purpose of avoiding too permanent ail that we shall recommend that future extensions made to reserves from time to time on economic grounds should not permanently guaranteed, but should be added by means of lease terms which would provide an adequate security, subject to liable conditions of user and development.1387. We have seen that the possibilities of inter-tribal ad-ments are very limited, but the chances are more hopeful for a etiation by individuals. By this means, surplus members of a ested tribe may be able to find some relief by going to live as and in the territory of another tribe, into which they will ntually be absorbed. But it is clear that even this method has limits, since no tribe will be willing to receive strangers in such Biibers as to threaten its own integrity7, and one is forced back phe conclusion that, although these facilities may be very useful, primary task of every tribe is to develop its own territory to its advantage.1388. &quot; No substantial improvement in  agriculture can  be Conditions icted unless the cultivator has the will to achieve a better stan- better&quot;1 *0 of living. ...

Education and demonstration are being undertaken to tend, and a good deal of progress is already- to be noticed in the(e agricultural districts. The model small holding at the Scott cultural Laboratories is a striking example, and is the more admired because it teaches the native that, if he wants a her standard of life, he must work for it, and shows him how po so. Demonstrations of model housing and the like should be accompanied by a practical lesson of this sort; otherwise 1 merely teach the native to be discontented with his lot without sing him the means of improvement. The first condition of ress in the reserves is that the natives should be brought to(ize that a higher standard is within their grasp if they will work Itain it and be prepared to accept guidance.
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter I]Conditions in the more Densely Populated Reserves.1390. In considering the present degree of attainment, we sh first review briefly the conditions obtaining among those tvil whose land is inhabited at a density which is beginning to c:uJ problems of land tenure to appear.  The principal examples are tl three Kikuyu districts; the three Kavirondo districts; to some el tent, the Teita district; and some of the small reserves on Coast.   Their distinctive feature is that any comprehensive [ gramme of improvement in agricultural or pastoral practice mil be dependent on considerations of the way in which the land is he] and occupied.1391.

And this deterioj tion, if it continues unchecked, will counteract the progress whi is being made in other directions, and must ultimately decrease! yield.1392. We have had widely divergent evidence on this poirf Major Grogan told us : &quot; With regard to the Kavirondo country, I was very mil struck by the obvious denudation and waste of land that] going on there.  You can see it very well from the air. land practically goes pink over large areas, and wise peoj leave it alone.&quot;And the picture which he drew of certain parts of the KikrJ country was equally gloomy. But the Director of Agriculture staj specifically that he was &quot;not prepared to subscribe to such alarmist view&quot;, which he considered to be very greatly exaggerate He stated : &quot; I should say there is no evidence of a decreasing yieldl crops grown. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence of i provement in the yield, due to better cultivation in the easel some natives and due to the use of better seed in the easel large numbers of natives. Speaking broadly, I should there is no evidence of deterioration in the thirteen years I lisj known the reserves.&quot;Speaking of the Kikuyu Beserves. he said :-&quot; Generally speaking, I see no evidence of the soil bel worn out. and I do not think there is any reason to be murj apprehensive about the future.

Native methods should not be readily condemned, and as a matter of fact they return to the soil a large amount of nitrogen and humus in the course of a year. Such variations in the native method as are being brought about by the efforts of the Department of Agri-culture are along the lines of not changing the system in so far as the variation of crops grown is concerned, but rather to get the same crops grown in a better fashion and in proper rota-tion.&quot;Mr. Wolfe, Acting Director of Agriculture, said : &quot; I am certainly of opinion that in the closely settled parts of the native reserves where shifting cultivation is at an end or coming to an end, there is going to be soil exhaustion, and sooner or later there are going to be serious difficulties unless a remedy is found.&quot;Mr. C. W. Hobley, C.M.G-., speaking of the Teita Reserve, ted in evidence : -&quot; I visited Teita at intervals during my service, and I was greatly struck by the progressive destruction of the cultivable area due to soil erosion during a period of thirty years, entirely caused by the unfortunate methods employed by the natives.&quot;, Hobley retired in 1921, and it would appear that the methods iloyed have to some extent improved in the course of the last Ive years.Dr. D. Bell, who has been stationed among the Teita for more three years, states in his evidence : &quot; The Teita as a people are very progressive. They manure their shambas, and irrigate them.&quot;the District Commissioner stated in his memorandum : &quot; The Teita are quick to follow a good example, and if profitable agriculture is demonstrated before their eyes, they readily follow suit.&quot;1393. The teaching of-the agricultural officers is having good ;t. and there are already numbers of advanced natives whose nor skill may be expected to communicate itself to the rest, some districts then; are already in existence standing sub-mittees of the Native Councils which deal with agricultural ects, while encouraging experiments are being made, especiallyiktiyu, in the direction of co-operative marketing.139-1. In the areas which we now have under review Kavir-. Kikuyu, Teita we see no reason to take any alarmist view the question of soil  deterioration  either through  mistaken
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES Pant III Chapter I]methods of crop production or through excessive accumulations ( live stock. While the natives suffer from failure to dig clown or t manure sufficiently, there is in other respects much to be con mended in their methods, and the &quot;static rotation&quot; which the achieve by means of iuterplanting is far preferable to the pcrsistei planting of a single crop, w-hich has characterized some forms ( industrial agriculture in European areas. But it cannot be denie that serious deterioration of the soil exists in many parts of the-reserves, and the problem will demand close attention by tl agricultural officers.1395. Overstocking does not exist in these districts in :. marked a degree as to call for special comment, but there at evidences of it in Ndeij^a, and in some other parts of Kikuyu; th was particularly stressed by Dr. Leakey (Evidence, pp. 688-692).1396. As to the numbers of stock in Kikuyu, we quote tl following from the evidence of Senior Chief Koinange, one ot tl more progressive of the Kikuyu chiefs : -&quot; All the counts that are made of the sheep and stock fc the Agricultural Department are purely  imaginary, because: - we keep back the true number which w:e possess, for fear tli; we shall be told that we have got too many.&quot;1397. In our opinion, this remark applies to the reserves i general, except for a few cases in which actual counts have bee made by the Veterinary&apos; Department in connexion with inoculatio or as a check on estimated numbers: in such cases it has alma invariably been found that the estimates are well below the actut numbers.rProblems of 1398. The question of distribution and the correct method (Land Tenure holding land is the outstanding problem in these areas. The popui: AnMis0S0 tion is already living, in some locations, at a density at whichman may be prevented by pressure of his neighbours from extendit the area of his cultivation without fragmenting it, and, while tit may have the advantage of inducing a more intensive eultivatic it is not to be expected that native custom will readily accommoda: itself or provide a means of solving problems of local congestie which are outside the range of tribal experience. If subdivision at fragmentation are allowed to continue unchecked, holdings threats to become uneconomic. On the other hand, if subdivision is ps vented, a landless class may appear at a time when alternath means of employment cannot readily be found in the reserve, an at least a temporary limit has been reached to the capacity of tl European area to accommodate more labourers.1399. But for the successful prosecution of agriculture it is! no means necessary that, every man should be a landowner.- 1
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES it III Chapter I]t, it is quite certain that advanced agriculture cannot be con-;ted on those lines, and it is worth while to mention that in ninark, the most agricultural of all European countries, only -tilths of the population are directly employed in agriculture, e other businesses, agriculture requires organization, and even h the limited degree of organization which is possible to natives the present state of their development, there should be many are employed in the derivative industries of carting and mar-2 and in preparing produce for the market. Then again, there lustries which are less directly derived, such as the profession schoolmaster, or the judicial elder, or the tribal policeman, , having in themselves no connexion with agriculture, are heless supported by funds derived from that source.100. There have always been industries of a kind in tribal d the professions of the soothsayer, the witch-doctor and the . and the makers of stools, pipes, instruments, etc., are ex-3. The fostering of village industries and the growth of social e centres have added materially to the list.  There are already suitable numbers of native shopkeepers and traders and a few 5; many owners of ploughs and carts, ready to plough on m or to transport produce for a share of the proceeds; a few liters and masons, and one or two natives who have started ivorks, or who dig sand or murrain; and here and there a e turned nurseryman and raising seedling trees for sale.  Be-tho ordinary muhoi, or tenant, there are a few labour-tenants ing for hire, and many &quot;herdsmen&quot; who undertake to fatten in return for a share of the increase. 1401. But it cannot be said that any of these classes are wholly cited by the professions which they have adopted, and the food e family is supplied from the gardens which the women cul-. Broadly speaking, there are as yet no natives in the reserves urn not in a large measure supported by the tillage of the1102. The point is important because of the bearing which it dii the problem of subdivision of holdings. In civilized countries oil is not regarded as the only means of livelihood, and co-on an overcrowded farm are willing to allow one of their ber to buy the others out and seek alternative employment here.   Such fluidity is unattainable among Kenya natives at stage, both because of the undeveloped state of industries and se of the habits and customs of the people.1403. Consequently, if the present tendencies continue, prob-of local congestion threaten to become acute, and attention ited to the various memoranda which stand in evidence on the

Until that has been done, it seems unlikely that dire,I steps taken to protect holdings against uneconomic subdivisiol could have much effect.1404. Fragmentation, as apart from subdivision, is a sped I problem of its own, and is probably susceptible of a more (liraI attack. The matter has been covered sufficiently in the part of oil Report which deals with the Kikuyu (sections 507-516 above), anI we also have it in evidence that a parallel state of affairs exists (I is threatened in parts of Kavirondo.1405. Security for tenants is another matter which require I attention, and, as far as Kikuyu is concerned, we record our defini; opinion, with which the administrative officers of the province hai expressed their concurrence, that&apos;more security is necessary.1406. Congestion is not yet more than a local phenomena existing in a few parts of these reserves. As has just been indicate a greater variety of employment would tend by itself to relit&apos;, congestion in respect of the number of cultivators ou the lan But there are also measures which would tend to distribute tl cultivators to better advantage. Firstly, the better provision roads and local markets and trading centres may induce a slacks ing of the economic pull towards the main centres. Secondly, t! introduction of higher priced crops or an improvement in the qtutli; of crops may enable an economic use to be made of land which now left derelict because of its distance from markets or from otlis causes. Thirdly, the distinction drawn between tenants and rigli holders must not differentiate against tenants to such an cxte: that right-holders will be unwilling to leave congested areas ai take uji land as tenants in more sparsely occupied areas elsewhere1407. Most of these points have already been covered in tl part of our Report which deals with the Kikuyu, and we shall not; further into detail here. But we wish to emphasize our opinio that the problem is essentially one of educating the people in tl better use of their land. It is a matter which the Administrate must undertake with the co-operation of all Departments workii in the reserves. The work does not begin and end with the educ tion of the individual; the tribal authorities have also to be ii structed.

But history does not lead us to expect that the land oblerns of any people can be settled b3- a spontaneous evolution of stoni, and some direction by authority is necessary. Very natur-lv and properly, the tribal elders and native councils will be luctant to enter upon innovations of which they have no experi-ec, and will turn a deaf ear to advice of which they have no means judging the value. We do not subscribe to the doctrine that in ch circumstances Government should never intervene; we hold at Government should take and use the powers to make rules.the system of land tenure should be based on native custom, [should be built up by forethought and planning, and regulated j rule. Nobody has ever disputed the propriety of Government hiring rules to protect the soil against exhaustion or to provide [equate safeguards for economic crop production or to order the fctruction of noxious weeds, and we can see no reason why, after lequate study, Government should not regard itself as equally le to guard against the still more insidious, because less obvious, lls which arise from an uneconomic fragmentation of the -land or ... an unjust method of dealing with tenants or from any other [[adjustment in the system of land tenure. 1409. In the case of the Kikuyu and possibly the Teita, the!;k additions which we have recommended may prove to be [able places in which any projected modifications might be tried wrimentally before they are applied to any part of the established ive reserve.1410. We now turn to the consideration of the conditions in The less t less densely populated native reserves.   They range in density pop^Jjtpd In the Machakos Akamba at 110 to the square mile to the Masai Reserves, labont 3 the Embu, Nandi, and Lumbwa being among the Ire thickly populated.Mil. The proclivity to accumulate stock without regard to Inotnic advantage is manifest among nearly all these tribes. 1412. Attempts have been made to persuade them to habits ofIed farming, not entirely without success.&apos; Even the Alasai have tin, in a very small way, to grow lucerne for their stock, and also showing a dawning interest in growing crops for their own requirements.  The Lumbwa and the Nandi are making some Kress, but it is not to be supposed that any of these tribes will bo otherwise than predominantly pastoral for a great many Irs. The most hopeful method is to make them better pastoralists at the same time to persuade them to methods of mixed ling.
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter 1]1413. Among the Nandi, Lnmbwa, Cherangani, and a fey others, the results of overstocking are not yet apparent, and it j possible that, at the moment, these reserves are not overstocked But the same factors which lead to useless accumulations of livi stock are present here as elsewdiere, namely bride price and tl native systems of barter and exchange, under which account kept not only of the animals exchanged but of their progeny als But, since the time factor is not yet pressing among these tribe there is every hope that a programme of education in better methoi of animal husbandry would achieve good results.1414. The Kamba of Machakos District are suffering fro: reckless overstocking in the ptast, and their position to-day is :ua difficult. Their reserve has deteriorated to such an extent tha until it has been reconditioned, it cannot carry even the number which the people might reasonably require, but ultimately, if prop treatment is applied, it should be able to do so.1415. It is encouraging to note that the Kamba theinselvi are showing some appreciation of the situation and a desire to cot with it, although efforts in this direction fall far short of the neei More especially in the Machakos District, the Kamba have large! extended the area of their cultivated land, and have also mac creditable efforts through their Native Councils to plant trees o the brows and slopes of hills, and thereby check off-scouring of tl hillsides. To the same end, they have also been persuaded to a tempt some hedging or ditching along contour lines. Budimentat though these efforts may be, they are hopeful signs. And we also ha it in evidence that fines have been inflicted by tribunal elders ft the offences of cutting down trees so that goats may eat the leavt and for stripping the bark off trees to make ropes.1416. In resrect of water conservation, their efforts have be; equally praiseworthy, and many excellent dams have been mar both in the Machakos and Kitui Districts. Their example migii well be followed in other reserves.1417. Nevertheless, the Machakos Native reserve is deteriom ing rapidly through overstocking, and while it is admitted tli educational  methods are ultimately&apos;  the best, we fear that, reliance is placed on education alone, better methods of anini husbandry will not be learnt until the damage is irreparable.141S. When we turn to the reserves of the Suk, the Njemp and the Samburu, the position is one of almost unrelieved gloo The people appear to show absolutely no regard for the ruinatic which is going on before their eyes, but devote their lives amassing vast herds of uneconomic live stock, which are fast tu ing their country into a desert.
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES tai III-Chapter I]1419. A full description of the position and recommendations lr remedies are given in a special chapter on the problem created overstocking (Chapter X of this Part). It is not therefore neces-fV 10 discuss the question here, but, because that chapter concen-ites mainly on the two factors of the live stock and the land, itIiy he well in this place to add a note on the human aspect and nsiiler the native viewpoint. For it will not be denied that, what-er emergency measures may be needed, the only ultimate solution die problem lies in the willingness of the native himself to co-eiate in his own salvation.1420. The educational end in view may be easily stated. Half e lesson will have been learnt as soon as the average native is idy to take one good cow in exchange for two bad cows, or, in (id- words, when he has regard to the quality rather than the jnlity of his cattle. The other half will be learnt when he ilizes that, in order&apos; to have good cattle, he must take steps to )tei:t his pasture.1121. Clearly the first thing to be done is to eliminate the trial reasons which make it hard for the natives to learn these Isons, and the first of them is the peculiar position which cattle goats occupy in native social life.   We may notice four in-ices : (a) When return of bride-price or any other debt payable in live stock is claimed, the return is ou the basis of a beast for a beast, although there is generally a tariff whereby (in Kamba and Kikuyu) one cow - two bulls -: ten goats.  With certain trifling exceptions, no distinction is made between a good beast and a bad one, and if the price fixed for a wife is, for instance, four cows and a bull, almost any four cows will do, and no lesser number, however good, would be accepted as quittance. (6) If a cow received in marriage price dies before it has calved, the hide and the meat may be returned, and another cow may be demanded.   It is therefore natural that natives should regard even barren cows as worth something more than their apparent value, (c) Most cases in the native courts relate to cattle, and the court fees are assessed ad valorem on the basis of a tariff under which a cow has a fixed value.  This gives a kind of official support to the view that one cow is as good as another.hA Very large numbers of cattle are held in some form of trust, so that, in many cases, a man would not feel himself justified in killing a beast, even if he wishes to do so, without a family gathering to sanction it.
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES Paiit III Chapter I]1422. It would be hard to describe the attitude of a native towards his cattle. It does not amount to veneration, but catf or goats play a part in most ceremonial transactions, and perhai acquire a hind of reflected sanctity. Such at least was the ophiic of the South African Economic Commission, 1930-32 (cf. sectio 33), and instances could be quoted to support such a view. B-we are on surer ground if we say that the native custom, frequent&apos;; exemplified, by which a man who parts with property retains certain interest in that property even after it has left him, creati so many interests and contingent interests that it is general difficult for a man to dispose of cattle without prolonged consult tion. But the freer circulation of money and the institution , markets are already having their effect, and these various rcstri tions and inhibitions are not so strong as they were.1423. It is obvious that we cannot, as a Commission, say ho far or how quickly it may be possible to modify these customs at practices without imposing ait undue strain on native institution We merely call attention to them as explaining, in some degra the reluctance of the natives to esteem their cattle by qualit rather than by quantity.1424.The more the open market can be made available for t! native stock, the more quickly these artificial values of natii custom will be counteracted. General 1425. The purpose with which this chapter is written docs itConditions^ oblige us to describe the particular problems of every reserve. Tl obtaining in essential points have now been considered in order, namely, t! the Reserves,   population, the density, distribution and degree of adyancemer.and the uses to which the land has been put. We have seen th the density over all is byr no means iu excess of the capacity of t! land, and there should be ample room for future expansion 1 many years, provided that the people are instructed in a mo economic use of the land and that a better distribution of populatii is secured. At present, a notable degree of maldistribution exis: and we have a position which is almost a paradox. While t population over all is sparse, a majority of the natives are livir in areas which are heavily- populated. Consequently, the Admin: tration is already grappling with problems of local congestion certain districts. The various additions which we propose to 1 made to native reserves will help in some degree . to ease tl situation. But a remedy promising more permanent results is to: found in keeping the assets in land as liquid as circumstances ar tribal security permit, so that any tendency of the population redistribute itself by a natural flow may not be unduly imped in its operation. More important even than this is that the popul tion should learn to make a correct use of the land which it has.
494ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES lirr III Chapter I]1426. We therefore proceeded to the consideration of the essen-problems as they presented themselves, firstly in the moreIiavily populated reserves, and afterwards in those which are more arsely occupied, and a somewhat significant distinction was mud.427. The most densely populated territory is that of the [ikuyu, and there we found that the crucial problem was neither imarily agricultural nor pastoral, but concerns itself with the Islein on which the land is held.  The second problem is agricul-[ival. and has to do with the fact that increased population has Infcly prevented the practice of shifting cultivation, while the \o[)le have hardly yet acquired the skill necessary for a more incentrated method without exhaustion of the soil.   We also iiieed a need for a better organization of marketing, and observed iat creditable efforts in that direction are already being made. .ol)lems of overstocking in the reserve proper are not yet serious, [it may become so.1.128. In Kavirondo and Teita, the two populations next in iler of density, problems of land holding have also begun to ap-ar. but not to the same extent. The primary requisite of develop-lent is an increase in agricultural skill and a greater production, with the Kikuyu, problems connected with live stock are as yet a minor order.1429. But when we come to the less populous areas, we find at overstocking is almost universal (except where it is prevented ; &quot;fly&quot; or some similar cause), and is such as to outweigh all [her problems in gravity.1430. In these areas there has been a progressive degeneration tattle and land, threatening a degeneration of the people. When ie natives can be taught to forsake their semi-religious attitude wards cattle and regard them as items in the food supply, which [quires to be augmented by other kinds of diet, they will begin to low in numbers and in skill. The need for a variation of diet will -increasingly appreciated. Following on that, the lesson will be ant that it may be expedient to plant special stock-feed, as is me in the case of goats by the Kikuyu.1431. On a comprehensive view of the whole position, we find lotl grounds for believing that the native population is advancing&quot; numbers and capacity in all but a very few of the reserves, and are encouraged to believe that this advance, as it proceeds, will ltd to a more economic outlook. But this is not the case in districts [di as Kamasia, which have become so devastated as to create the f that the population will not be able to maintain itself even at existing density, and, since the process is cumulative in its effect,
ON PRESENT CONDITIONS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter I]may ultimately be threatened with extinction. The imperativH necessity for a policy and programme of reconditioning, whic must include the reduction of live stock, is therefore obvious. Tti with no wish to disparage the valuable work which has already bee done by administration and departmental officers and by native Councils in this field that we record our opinion that the urgency t the problem calls for still more intensive effort.1432. In oui- survey of Kikuyu problems in Part I of th Report, we indicated that in our opinion the problem of intern; development and control is of an importance and intricacy whic demands the attention of all departments operating in the nath reserves, co-ordinated under the general direction of the Provinci Commissioner. The present more general survey of all the reservi reinforces that conclusion.
CHAPTER II.IHE GENERAL LINES PROPOSED FOR THE SOLUTION OE THE NATIVE LAND PROBLEM.1-133. The land in which we recommend that the natives should re facilities has already been classified at section 22 of the eft. For ease of reference, we repeat the tabulation below, and have added more descriptive detail.Class A.- The iwesent native reserves, plus the additions which we have recommended to be made as Class A, minus such areas as wc have recommended to be surrendered in cases of exchange.  These lands should rank fully as native reserves.Class B. Land recommended to be added to the native eserves, but under special conditions.  These would be added !o fulfil certain economic needs, and we shall allude to them as Native Reserves Class B.This class is subdivided into Bl and B2, the former being aod which wo recommend to be added because the tribe ap-pears likely to have permanent need of it, and the latter being-land which we recommend to be added to fulfil a. need which appears to be of a more temporary character.Class C. Land fo be set apart for alienation on lease to natives, whether as groups, families or individuals. Pi-provided hat leases to non-natives should be allowed and even en-(jouraged in cases in. which the Land Board agrees that such i course would be of more benefit to native interests generally than that the land should be leased directly to natives; and provided that, while there is ample room, short leases may be granted to non-natives for any purpose with the consent of the Board.Class D. Areas in wdiich natives will have equal rights with other races in respect of the acquisition of land.Note. Classes A and B relate to land which will be native reserves, and schedules will be given at the end of this chapter. Classes C and D relate to facilities on a non-tribal basis. A schedule of lands recommended to be Class C and a general description of lands under Class D will be found in Chapter VIII.1134. We recommend that Class A Reserves be known as ive Lands.   This point is covered in further recommendations (sections 1635-1649).
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]1435. We recommend further that Class El lands be kimwil as Native Reserves, but not as Native Lands; and that Class ft lands be known as Temporary Native Reserves. Under our recom mendations, Class B land will not, as in the case of Class A land cease to be Crown land, and we think-it right that a distinction ii name should emphasize the distinction in fact, between the lam to which the natives have a claim on historical grounds and fcfta which has been given to them by Government on economic ground?That Class C lands be known as Native Leasehold Areas.That all the above classes of land be known comprehensive! as Native Areas.1436. If our recommendations are adopted, these terms will h in common use and be readily understood.  Meanwhile, for the pin poses of this Report, it will be best if, as a general rule, we keei to the designations A, Bl, B2, and C, and refer to them Native Reserves.1437. There are certain governing considerations of an import anoe which demands attention in this place; otherwise the genera nature of our proposals will not be clear.1438. Native lands, Class A, can be considered as a whole, o they can be conceived in their component parts as particular nativt lands reserved for particular native tribes.1439. Regarding them as a whole, we recommend that th duties to be discharged by the Board under the trust should be U) to maintain the integrity of the boundaries against any alters lion except such as may lawfully he made under the Ordinance a amended by any action which Government takes upon our Report (ii) to make representations to the Governor or the Secretary o State, if the area comprised within the boundaries is not bean! &quot;administered, managed, developed and controlled&quot; for the use ahi benefit of the natives as provided in the Ordinance. But the actun administration, management, development and control would de volve as a separate trust upon Government directly, though th Board would have certain powers of intervention and veto foi protective purposes. We shall recommend that the Lands Trust Ordinance be amended in this sense and shall give supportiuj argument.1440. We shall further recommend, with supporting argument that Native Beserves Class A cease to be Crown lands and b( styled Native Lands, subject to adequate safeguards to protect tin rights and powers of Govexmrnent.Certain Governing Considera-tions.Security for Native Lands. Class &quot;A&quot;.
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED total 111 Chapter II]1141. The trust which the Board would have to discharge, in spect of the boundaries, might conceivably involve their protec-0n even against the Government of Kenya. Therefore it must be rotected against the contingency that Government might amend ie Ordinance at will and thereby alter the conditions of the trust. \. recommend therefore that an Order in Council be sought to -otect&apos;against amendment those clauses of the Ordinance which :11 declare the external boundaries of Native Reserves, Class A; id (ii) deline the conditions on which such boundaries may be tered or amended.1442. We now turn to the other aspect of the matter, and (ij) I&quot; Respectoard these areas in their component parts. As the Ordinance is   * e . c .    iiii . iit ni     componentpresent constituted, these components are the lands stated to be Units.espectively reserved&quot; to particular tribes. Such a reservation for ever&quot; seems to us unwise. We are fully alive to the value of Istering tribal loyalties and protecting tribal institutions, but when le look at the matter purely from the standpoint of land, too rigid entail ought to be avoided, and ^he terms of the trust should it be such as to deprive Government of the power to makeIjnstments, however rarely it may be that the necessity for the mill arise.1143. In this connexion, we would again refer to the passage bm Professor E. H. Brook&apos;s History of Native Policy in South friai, which is quoted in section 1385.1-144. But we need not look as far as South Africa for examples embarrassments which a permanent entail of specific lands specific tribes may cause; there is no lack of them in Kenya.  It right to be warned and to seek for a method which will reserve Government an ultimate power of adjustment, while preserving tribes a full and adequate security&apos;.   Regarding the reserves as present gazetted, we find that some of them follow tribal bound-ies, and some do not.   Some tribes have more than one reserve, for instance the Kikuyu, for whom three separate, though con-juous, native reserves have been gazetted ; while some reserves are lerved to more than one tribe without any attempt to define pere the tribal boundaries occur.  An instance of this kind is the Bath Kavirondo Native Reserve, which contains at least three biiiet tribes.   After hearing evidence, we are satisfied that these jisions are neither logical nor convenient.   We find that it is Itter to keep the units as lai&apos;ge as possible, only setting boundaries pere some consideration of tribal security or administrative con-nienee appears to demand it.1145. There is no absolute necessity that our land units should[respond with administrative or political boundaries. Neverthe-s. a general correspondence is dictated both by convenience and
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]also by the fact that administrative boundaries often delimit tribj frontiers. When several tribes, having the same or a similar svstei of land tenure, are included in the same province, we consldi that they should be grouped in the same land unit, unless there some strong reason to the contrary.1446. All that such a grouping would connote is that tl customs regarding tho tenure of land existing-within the grot are the same or similar and could be developed along similar line; although it is possible that when modifications are introduced 1: rule, it might sometimes be found that special rules might hat to be applied to some special area within the unit in order to sa the requirements of some particular sub-tribe, group or sectioi But there is no need to regard either the units themselves or tl separate groups within tho units as exclusively reserved to the inhabitants, and reasonable interpenetration is desirable. An special customs (as they tire or as they may become, either ttoons spontaneous evolution or as a result of modifications) would gover the situation in regard to the admission of natives of other groii] or tribes, and provide a reasonable security and a sufficient degrt of exclusive possession for the occupant tribe.1447. A full list of the units which we recommend for gazeitt ment in place of the existing reserves as now gazetted will be foun in Table I at the end of this chapter, but the following two instance may be given here as examples : (a) The reserves now separately gazetted as the Kiambu, FciHall, Nyeri (together with the Embu and Meru) Nath Reserves, along with Class A additions as recommendet to be gazetted as a single unit reserved as Native Laud of the Kikuyu tribe.(b) The reserves now separately gazetted as the Machako-Native Eeserve and the Kitui Native Reserve, along wit Class A additions as recommended, to be gazetted as single unit as Native Bands of the Kamba tribe.1448. Two points clearly arise in regard to these lands. Firstly bow, if at all, can their external boundaries be altered? Am secondly, bow are these large units to be subdivided between tli several tribes and groups resident&apos; in them?1449. We have to consider the contingency that the tribe oi tribes inhabiting one of these units might be diminished in mint bers, while the tribe or tribes inhabiting a neighbouring unit mighi increase. In extreme cases, an alteration of boundary might h required, and in so important a matter Government would having to retain a full responsibility and could not resign the function tt a.Board.  On the other hand, we think that the Board ought to bf
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSEDjjM III-Chapter II] ;[,!e 10 express au opinion. We therefore recommend that if oveinment should ever deem it necessary to add to the territory one unit by diminishing the territory of another unit, the Lands rust Board should be consulted, and the Secretary of State, if he trees with Government, should seek an Order in Council effecting p^e alteration.1150. In the cas;e of minor adjustments of such boundaries, we iiier that it should be within the power of the Governor to (ft.1! the necessary alterations.1451. In regard to adjustments which may have to be made tween the boundaries of the tribes occurring in the same unit mbu and South Nyeri), we consider that the Governor should ide.  In our opinion, it is not a matter within the purview of Lands Trust Board, because an adjustment of political bound-   -es does not affect private rights.452. Our reason for recommending that areas added to native Security of erves on the grounds of economic needs should be under Class B Lands^ la desire to keep the conn try&apos;s assets in land as fluid as possible to ensure that the land is properly and efficiently utilized.1453. The rapid rise and decline in the strength of families or Hips among polygamous peoples is notorious, and where the item of bride-price prevails it is likely to be still more marked. ie relative strength of tribes and consequently their requirements land may be subject to rapid fluctuation, and it will therefore B;be prudent to lock up the land too rigidly against the possibility1redistribution.  Therefore there must be no suggestion that, be-tse an area of land is given to a native reserve as Class B land satisfy an economic need, it is of necessity to be devoted to the and benefit of the tribe for ever, but the permanency of the    . ..; &quot;* r,, Dcatiou should depend upon the duration of the need. 14-54. There is another reason why the Crown should not divest -&apos;IIf irrevocably of its rights over such land.   We cannot too mgly emphasize the need for making all such grants subject conditions which will protect the land against misuse, and, in ticular, overstocking should be prevented by a limitation of the bber of stock which the area is authorized to carry. 14-55. On the other hand, security must be found for the natives occupy and develop the land.   There must be no fear that it be taken away from them without due consideration for the Its and interests of the groups which have been using it. J145G. After considering these factors, we have recommended Ibtlivision of Class B into Class Bl and B2, the former consisting land which we find to be required by the tribe concerned to
ON THE GENERAL LINES OE ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]fulfil a need which is likely to be permanent; and the latter col sisting of land required for some special need, which may prove-I be only temporary in character. We recommend that Class 11 should be added to the reserve upon conditions, while Class 11 land should be leased to the tribe. In both cases, there should!I strict conditions of conservation and use.1457. In respect of land now proposed by us to be Class   I -we recommend a low rental perhaps a peppercorn. In respect I any further land which it may subsequently become desirable I add to native reserves we consider that, whether they he added I Class Bl or as Class B2, rent should lie charged on an econoitl basis.1158. The areas now recommended to be Bl and B2 are shot I in schedules attached to this chapter..1459. Class Bl lands should, in our opinion, be under il protection of the Lands Trust-Board. They should not be dint I ished or taken away without the consent of the Board, excepti: only that an appeal should lie to the Secretary of State, who shot be able, if he considers that sufficient cause exists, to override t veto of the Board. But, saving this protection, the clauses retro! ing the terms and conditions upon which the tenure may be t minated should not be matters embodied in the Order in Count since it is desirable that freedom be preserved to amend such ten and conditions as convenience and the general objects in view re dictate.1460. Leases of Class B2 land should be terminable by &apos; Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State; provii that the Lands Trust Board should be consulted.Class C Lands &apos; 1461. We consider that Native Lands. Class C, should be Leasehold apart to be let on lease in blocks or individual plots. Bents wo Areas). be paid to general revenue, but wo recommend that, while tlWould not be definitely earmarked, a general obligation shouldrecognized to use them for the improvement of these areas. 1462. In recommending the provision of such areas we havemind primarily three classes of persons for whom they woulduseful : -(a) Advanced natives in the reserves who might be desit of renting land which they could develop as a prh holding.(6) Returned labour-tenants from alienated areas, who. hat lived for several years away from the control of tribali may find it difficult to be re-accommodated in their ( reserve, either through lack of room for themselves their stock, or because a tribal life is no longer conget
ON THE GENERAL LINES OE ACTION PROPOSED jrt III-Chapter II](c) &quot;Detribalized&quot; natives who are loosely attached to towns, and who should be removed from them and offered the alternatives of going to live in the reserve with which they have most affinity, or of taking up land in these blocks, if they can afford to do so.1463. It cannot be supposed that native life in Kenya can ways be conducted on tribal lines, and gradual progress towards ivate tenure in the reserves, which is eminently desirable, will obably be facilitated by allowing some of the more advanced lives to gain experience in this way.1464. We also have to envisage the possibility that whole nilies or groups, especially from among the landless mbari of om we have heard much in the Kiambu district, may enrol mselves as corporate bodies and apply for comparatively large des, which they would then subdivide among themselves accord-to principles to be covered in the clauses of the lease, which aid have to provide for a recognized method of succession and eguard the title against excessive subdivision.1465. But when all is said, it will still be the case, for many b to come, that the bulk of the natives require the shelter of bal life and will prefer to remain in the reserves. We may take as doubtful whether, in the early years of the scheme, the niber of applications will be very large, but it is reasonably tain that the numbers will grow as congestion in the more popu-s reserves increases. We are therefore faced with the position t, if our reservations under Class C are very extensive, it may many years before the blocks are taken up, while if they are illy restricted they will not provide an adequate outlet for the &quot;re.&apos;1466. It might be contended that for an increasing population outlet could ultimately be sufficient, but we oppose to that the stderation that &quot;C&quot; areas are intended to provide for needs th are essentially of a transitional nature, namely, the needs of ives who are just emerging from tribalism and still require da! protection.  But, when in process of time natives pass that e, they may appropriately be required to take their chance in petition with other races in &quot;D&quot; areas, in which land would freely bought and sold without racial discrimination.   It there-appears to be our duty to make such provision as promises to ce for at least one or two generations, after which Government have to consider, in the light of experience gained, whether her extensions of &quot;C&quot; areas are necessary, or whether the is ripe for allowing a free market in land in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; s alike.
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]1467. Bearing these considerations in mind, we have propos that blocks totalling 939 square miles, as detailed in the achedt given in section 1879 below, be set apart as &quot;G&quot; areas for allocati to natives on lease. But in order that this may not render idle t, balance of land not immediately required, we have recommend that leases should be allowed to non-natives for any purpose whi the Board considers to be in the native interest. While ordina agricultural or grazing leases should be on a short-term basis, Ion term leases might reasonably be allowed in cases where major wor! are to be undertaken, as, for instance, a water scheme or so scheme of &quot;large scale production which the Board agrees to beneficial to the natives.1468. The terms and conditions on which land in &quot;C&quot; are: should be made available to natives will receive careful consider tion in Chapter VIII below. It will be sufficient in this place allude to the financial consideration that, while in the initial stag it will be easy to find suitable land without much expense, in i! later stages it may be found that expensive works are required before more land can be rendered suitable. It will therefore be right f Government from the outset to have regard to these potenti developments, and consider how the scheme, in general, can financed, and whether the holdings can be expected to provide return, either directly or indirectly, for the money spent upon therSecurity for 1469. W7e recommend that the boundaries of the areas reeo.CfdiVe&apos;&apos;C&quot;ndS mended to be Class C lands (Native Leasehold Areas) should proclaimed under the Order in Council, so that they may not diminished or extended without the authority of a further Order Council, except that exchanges should be permissible, if the Boa agrees. The devising of terms and conditions under which leas to natives should be granted both in general and particular cas would be a task for which Government would be responsible as matter of. internal management, and the Board would not be eo cerned. But no lease to a non-native should be granted witho the consent of the Board, except that the Chief Native Comm sioner should have power to act for the Board in minor matters the same extent as, under our recommendation, he would have native reserves (see recommendations in Chapter VI below).r,and, 1470. Lands in Class D would not need to be specially pClass &quot;D&quot;.      claimed.   They are all the lands in the Colony and Protector;(other than Turkana and the Northern Frontier) which are neitl recommended to be European Highlands or Native Lands, Clas A, B or C, nor already dedicated in some manner involving so. degree of racial discrimination, as, for instance, the Mazrui la. on the Coast.

While it would not be jr for the Commissioner of Lands, in discriminating between ipiicants, to give prior consideration to natives or to any other ution of the public, there would be no objection to advice being ven to native applicants by the District Commissioners in the &apos; serves, so that the applications could be put in a form in which ey would be likely to be favourably regarded. It would often be niid suitable for a group of natives to enrol themselves as a cor-irate body with perpetual succcsssion and apply for a compara--cly large block, to be administered according to terms which mid be covered in the lease.1472. Our recommendations under Classes A and B cover the Further esent and immediate future needs of the population living in the Fac&apos;llltie9-serves, and it is expected that instruction in better agricultural jthods will enable the land to carry an increased population and , to a large extent, solve the problems of the more distant future so: Additional facilities will be afforded by the areas set apart ider &quot;C&quot; for alienation to natives on lease and the opportunities tder &quot;D&quot; for the acquisition of land by natives in areas where privilege of race exists.  But lands under C and D will be found re suitable for comparatively advanced natives than for the bulk the population, who still require the shelter of tribal life, and, ee there are some reserves in which a degree of local congestion eady exists, it is necessary to consider what general facilities available or should be found for effecting a better distribution the population in the reserves, or for effecting additions or hanges if need should arise.1473. We recommend that, when the boundaries of lands in Additions to isses A, B and C have been proclaimed, any subsequent exten- Reserves ns which may be required in any of these classes should be de by the Governor, subject to the approval of the Legislative tneil.  Such additions should normally be by lease.The above paragraph is not to be read in the sense that any ensions to the land can henceforth be made on the grounds of torical right, a subject which, if our Report is accepted, should held to be finally settled; the only additions to Class A lands ich should be contemplated are those which are incidental to hanges or petty adjustments.1474. We recommend that exchanges should normally be by Exchanges, tual lease, the Governor being empowered to make such ex-nges, subject to the consent of the Lands Trust Board and the jislative Council; provided that the land to be leased must first
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]Inter-penetration between Tribes.be set apart and be subject to the procedure and safeguards whicj we shall presently recommend (sections 1526, 1531 and 1541) to observed before land in a native reserve can be set-apart or lease1475. Tn exceptional cases, if it is desired that the exchang be on a more permanent basis, we recommend that, if the loe: natives have been consulted and if the Local Native Council, th Local Land Board, the Lands Trust Board, the Governor and th Legislative Council all agree, then it should be possible for tl: exchange to be made by process of permanent exclusion an compensatory addition.1476. Before any land in a native reserve is excluded or lease for the purpose of an exchange, it is first necessary that any ri h holders or other natives resident on the land should be compensation: This should be done by the method described in section 1511 (su! sections 5-9) below for the setting apart of land and the payment ( compensation.1477. Allusion has already been made in several places to peao ful penetration between tribes, especially as a result of ihte marriage.   We regard this as the most useful method of dishbuting theation.  ft also generally tends to raise the avelevel of attainment, since it leads to a pooling of ideas, and tribe gain experience of each other&apos;s mode of life.   It may occasions happen that penetration takes place so rapidly and in such numb as to constitute a real or imagined menace to the security of occupant tribe, and it is therefore evident that power must reserved to the Provincial Commissioner to put a. stop to authorized movements at such periods.   While recourse to si measures might frequently be necessary in the more remote an. uncivilized parts of the Colony, the&quot;need for such action among th more advanced tribes should be of rare occurrence.1478. We affirm as a principle that the maximum of fluidii compatible with security should be allowed.1479. The weight of the evidence before the Commission that, when native tribes are allowed free intercourse, they find modus vivendi, but that anything in the nature of a buffer area ineffective in preventing conflicts between tribes, and tends to di courage peaceful penetration.  The same thing applies to too rigi an enforcement of boundaries between tribes.1480. While the infiltration of families or individuals of or tribe into the territory of another may frequently cause administr tive embarrassment of a minor kind, such, for instance, as a dili culty in keeping hut-tax registers, the advantages of securing a mot fluid distribution are such as decidedly to outweigh any such cot sideration, and we recommend that, unless the occupant nil
5: K&apos;.ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSEDjin-, I i [ ClIAl-TKU II]ejects, peaceful interpenetration should not be prevented.   Thetircc of these remarks will be clear when it is realized that, while iereserves as a whole are sparsely populated, the general average -.&apos;-iy in the tliree Kikuyu and three Kavirondo districts, which bniain between them more than half of the total native population the Colony, is 170 to the square mile.11181. We go so far as to assert that interpenetration is the ost hopeful of all the met hods, for securing a more, even distribu-it is not so likely to cause resentment as inter-tribal leases, inmigrahts who penetrate in small groups will become ab-.......  But the process is slow, the problem is urgent, and otherd more direct methods with more immediate results are also Iqiared.We shall next examine the possibility of extending tribal [rriiory by additions of adjacent land.I 1483. If one tribe has insufficient land and another has more W Inter-tribal Lit requires, it appears to have been contemplated in the Lands   00FOS-lust Ordinance that the one tribe should lease land to the other, [hen describing the leasehold clauses of the Bill in the Legislative ncil on the 12th May, 1928, the Governor stated, in the course tis speech : -&quot; 1 have dealt so far with the possibility that the reserves now gazetted may not prove largo enough for a greatly in-creased population. It is equally necessary to deal with the possibility that some of them may prove too large and rich for effective use as a whole by any possible increase of their tribal population. ... I am convinced that this contingency must be met as squarely as the other : and it may be met in more than one way by the leasehold clauses in the Bill. In the first place, the tribe owning spare land may lease it to mem-hers of another tribe for development.&quot;1484. Although it is clear from the above passage that leases The present ween tribes were contemplated, the machinery provided for them Leaseholdi- \JltlUS6S   irethe Ordinance was ill-adapted to such a purpose. Section 10 unsuitable to *vi:les that the rent shall be fixed at the &quot; highest amount that Inter-tribalreasonably be expected to be obtained for the hind, having Leases-lard to all the circumstances of the case,&quot; while section 7 pro-33 that land may not be leased &quot; unless there is reason to teve that the natives of the tribe for which such land has been ivcrl will derive benefit, apart from any revenue which may lie therefrom, from the grant of such lease.&quot; And by the le section it is provided that the lease may not take place if the j5 is being beneficially occupied by the said natives, or if it is jlv to be required for their use and support during the currency he lease.
ON THE GENERAL LINES OE ACTION PROPOSED Part III Chapter II]The Need for Special Clauses.The Termina-6ion of Inter-tribal Leases.1485. It does not seem to be equitable that if a tribe wi to let a piece of land to another tribe at something less than thj highest rent which can reasonably be expected to be obtained the land, it should be precluded from doing so. Secondly, a tri would seldom admit that it was likely to enjoy any benefits, ap; from revenue, by leasing any part of its territory to another tr Thirdly&quot;, it would be quite impossible to say that the land was &quot;likely to be required for the use and support of the tribe durinj the currency of the lease&quot;, since no date could be assigned to final determination. The Report of the Commission on Clo Union observes : &quot; It could hardly be made on any but a perm nent basis, for it would be a matter of grave difficulty to displace population which had come to rely on the occupation of the area fcj the normal conduct of its life.&quot;I486. Tor these reasons, it is clear that special clauses have to be made to govern the question of leases between tribes] and we are in agreement with the opinion expressed by the Hi Young Commission (p. 347) to the effect that Government musl retain direct responsibility in such matters arid could not fit tin, resign them to the Lands Trust Board.   We consider that thj Board should be consulted, but should not have the final voice; the Governor and the Board are not agreed, the final decision slioulj rest with the Secretary of State.1487. In regard to the termination of an inter-tribal lease, agree with the Hilton-Young Commission that it would be diflicult but we believe that much can be done by a progressive advancement towards individual tenure.   Probably the best kind of lease woulj be one which is revisable at somewhat frequent intervals, eacl revision showing a progressive devolution from the tribe toward! the individual.  In the first stage, the lease is (for practical puf poses) from one tribe to another, but gradually it might be change! into a lease between certain groups of the one tribe and certanj groups of the other, and ultimately descend to families and possible individuals.   At the last stage, it ceases to be a matter of tribj concern, and would simply be a case of certain individuals of on] tribe holding leases from certain individuals of the other tribe conditions conformable to the uses and custom of land tenure taining in that tribe.  Processes of transfer would come into operl tion, and an economic distribution of population would take placj regardless of tribal origin.1488. These developments are. of course, far in the fuhiii but we do not think that it is too soon to contemplate them as] processs. In making these observations, we have in mind primarif the more advanced tribes.
5011-189. We now turn to the case of a lease required by a tribe (ii). Leases to a. ji tin area where no special racial privilege exists i.e. in &quot;D&quot; ^iie^re &apos;JJ0AroasjlW1. SpecialPrivilegesi 190. We recommend that leases to a tribe, qua tribe, should exist, generally be confined to cases in which the area to be leased is djacent to the territory of the tribe.   In other cases, the leases oulJ be leases to groups, families or individuals in either &quot;C&quot; or D&quot; areas.-191. Secondly, we recommend that if the adjacent land to be Hei to the reserve is already held upon title, Government takeI;cp.-; to re-acquire the land before letting it to the tribe, since it is referable that the tribe should hold the land as from Government ml not from any individual.1-192. We recommend strict conditions of conservation and use, Inch would naturally be taken into consideration in fixing the jit. The point of greatest importance is that the area should be developed to the best advantage as an asset of the Colony.1493. It is obvious that Government and not the Board should udtict the operation, fixing both the rental and the conditions.1194. If the land in respect of which the application is made (iii) Lease to a situated in the European Highlands, the same general conditions ^j,&apos;&apos;,&apos;,^ is in^he wild apply, but it is clear that the European community would European ve to be consulted, and some practical means would have to be Highlands, vised, whether through the District Councils or otherwise.   In is ease therefore, we recommend that agreement should be sought tween the Government, as representing the Colony as a whole, d accredited representatives of the European community.1195. If agreement cannot be reached, the question which esents itself is whether, if at all, the lease can be forced through (spite of the opposition of the European community.1496. In another part of the Report we shall make a recom-endation that the external boundaries of the area in which a ropean privilege obtains should be proclaimed under Order in luncil. This would, in this respect, place it in a position in which is comparable with a native reserve, and it may well be argued tt the conditions under which natives should be able to obtain a se of land in the European Highlands should correspond with conditions under which Europeans are able to obtain a lease i native reserves.   According to the recommendations which we making to regulate leases in native reserves, it will be possible, sufficient need arises, for leases to be granted to Europeans even the natives concerned and the Eocal Native Council object, but : not be possible if the Band Board objects.   The analogyON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED j)AIlT III Chapter II]
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III Charter II]Summary of Facilities.A Note on Labour-tenants.demands that, if the need were sufficiently urgent, a lease t, natives of land in the White Highlands might be forced throng against the wishes of the owner of the land (possibly by the aj.pl cation of the Land Acquisition Act), or against the wishes of th District Council, but not in face of any objection by accredite representatives of the whole of the European Highlands. We cor sider that this argument is fair to both parties, and recommen that the above procedure be adopted.1497. In the foregoing paragraphs we have described the fact ities which we recommend on tribal lines, by extensions of native reserves, and have explored the possibilities of leases to tribes el the inter-tribally or otherwise; and the potentialities of interpene tion. We have also recommended facilities on non-tribal lines our proposals under Classes C and D. In order that the neccssit for the two latter classes may be clearer, we shall now add a not on the problem provided by the existence in the European Hig! lands of a large number of native labour-tenants or squatters. Fi in our judgment, it is for this class of native that the chief utilit of &quot;(&quot;&apos; and &quot;D&quot; areas will be found, so that the question of ai commodating them after discharge from the farms may be moi easily settled.1498. There exists outside the reserves a squatter populn which cannot be far short of 150,000 persons, or 30,000 familie five. While the reserves as a whole are able to accommodate t own natural increase, these squatters (of whom over two-thirds at Kikuyu) cannot in all cases be accommodated in the reserves v out very grave embarrassment, both as regards the individuals an their stock; the difficulty as regards the individuals being m; caused by the system of land tenure, particularly in Kikuyu. 1 respect of the squatters who are not Ivikuyu, the embarrassmer arises not so much in regard to the squatters themselves as the herds of live stock. It would be rash to rely on the settled being able, as a permanent condition, to absorb more squattei than are now residing there, and tire numbers of their stock certainly have to be reduced.1499. There is therefore a problem how the natural men of the squatters is to be accommodated. The magnitude of difficulty will be realized when we say that it would be possible f. 600 squatter families of five to leave the settled area yearly, an for the loss to be made good by a natural increase of 2 per cenj which is not an unreasonably high estimate in the circumstances1500. At present, most squatters, when they leave the settl area, would probably prefer to return to their reserves rather tit take up land on some form of private tenure in an alternate area, even if it were made available for them.  But the more thi
ON THE GENERAL LINES OP ACTION PROPOSED jut HI Chapter II],this, the greater the strain on the reserves, and especially on the ,ree Kikuyu Reserves, which are already densely populated. As 0years pass and the reserves fill up, it will be increasingly difficult r natives, who have been long absent, to return and cultivate or tl room for their stock in their reserves. The increased individ-lism and independence of mind which they will have acquired in j settled areas will incline them to seek places where they can ril land on private title, if such can be found.1.591: We feel that in equity an obligation exists to provide lative land (not in the Highlands, where a special privilege Europeans obtains) in which such natives could take up land line form of private right on reasonable terms. Such areas we Be to provide by our recommendations regarding Native Lease-Areas, Class C.1502. A point of paramount importance must now be made. In Development-chapter we have described the lines on which we propose that jfal^]gtlV0 iative land problem should be solved, in so far as the provision nd is concerned.   But no provision of hind could, by itself, bly solve the problem.  The crucial point is how the land is to sed.1.503. Tins chapter is intended only as a preliminary survey, h the subsequent chapters will amplify. We shall therefore intent in this place to mention the point. But recommenda-designed toprotect the hind from misuse we regard as forming -.-ential a- part of our duties as recommendations for the pro-; of land. Both of them are equally &quot;needs of natives in &apos;ct of land&quot;.1504. There are two principles by which in our opinion any Summary of system must be judged, namely, security and fluidity, and it Chapter, vvnlial that there should be a proper balance, between the two. feel that the present system in Kenya, as embodied in the ve Lands Trust Ordinance, lays too great an emphasis on ity in so far as the native reserves are concerned. The security led amounts, in effect, to a permanent entail to definite tribes even to units of tribes. In the circumstances which called the mance into being, it was right that security should he accorded prior emphasis, and in making our recommendations for the jment of claims of right we also have given it first place in our id. But we recommend that the severity of the entail to par-.u- tribes should be mitigated by a liberal interpretation which id admit of a peaceful penetration by groups or families of r tribes to the utmost extent which native custom and the rily of the occupant tribe permits. When we come to the ircments which are based on economic needs, we have en-onred to lay the stress on fluidity.  When facing an uncertain
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED Part III-Chapter II]future, we consider it most important that the task of Governnieni in future years should not be compromised by a premature lockim up of the country&apos;s assets in land. They must be kept as fluid ai is consistent with the security of the developing occupiers. Whili every precaution must be taken to safeguard their rights, we do no consider it necessary-y or desirable that extensions made to nativi reserves on economic grounds should be accompanied by any gnat antee of absolute permanency.1505. We can conceive a tribe so decreasing in numbers tin the land would no lonsrer be economically necessary for them and, in that case, facilities should be available to permit of it development by other people.1506. &quot;Furthermore, tribalism cannot be considered as necessary  sarily permanent in itself, but is merely a stage in social evolution When tribalism vanishes, land reserved for ever for a particula tribe is meaningless. While therefore we have taken care to reeom mend the reservation of adequate land for the present and immediat future needs of each tribe, and have provided for the contingent:; that a tribe may need to extend its boundaries still further by mean of the Governors power to add to reserves or by means of a triba lease, we have devoted equal attention to the provision of mean whereby individuals may, sq to speak, hive off from the tribe, am go and take up land in &quot;C&quot; or &quot;D&quot; areas on lease. It is clea that the whole problem turns on the use to which the land is put both in these areas and also in the reserves. If the reserves ai developed under improved methods of agriculture aud stock-farmin they will carry a larger population and the requirements in the wa of &quot;C&quot; areas will proportionately be less. Similarly, if the part of the &quot;C&quot; areas in use are well developed, the raising of revenu for further development will be easier.1507. But we believe that it will not be possible for the nativi to develop the &quot;C&quot; areas entirely unaided. Problems of watt supply and conservation have to be considered, and it will probabl be found beneficial to allow large companies either to take n *eases on terms or to enter into contracts which will ensure th development of the resources in the best interests of the natives.1508. The development of parts of these areas will, we feai require very considerable capital expenditure. But it is probabl that before these parts are required the native population will hat increased considerably beyond its present proportions, and tlu increase in population and prosperity will, we hope, simplify tl raising of the necessary capital.
ON THE GENERAL LINES OF ACTION PROPOSED lT ]JI Chapter H]1500. It may appear to some that the native leasehold areas e unnecessarily large, but on the. evidence before us we consider in to be justified. There are likely to be considerable numbers natives living outside the reserves, either in towns or as labour-ant.&apos;&apos; ou farms, who may find it difficult to re-accommodate piuselves in the reserves, and for whom alternative provision has he made. This is a problem which is likely to increase in magnitude-le with the passage of time, and has occupied a foremost place our minds in determining the extent of the areas which we pider necessary to set apart under Class C.1510. Our fourth type of land. Class D, is land in which tin I grants and transfers shall be made absolutely irrespective race. This method provides a free market in land and the simttm of fluidity, and it is a method to which the natives may expected increasingly to resort as they advance in civilization 1 experience.

Considerable difficulty has been experienced, especial! in the Kikuyu Province, in finding&quot; a satisfactory&apos; method of coij compensating right-holders, when plots are required for purposes social service, trade, or industry.   The method provided in tlj Lands Trust Ordinance for the acquisition of such plots is leasl .or, if the plot is required for a public purpose within the meanii of section 15 (1) of the Ordinance, there may be exclusion ail exchange for another area to be added elsewhere.   There is all a practice of &quot;setting apart&quot;, the authority for which is derivj from rules made in 1931, which will be quoted below.  It is nece sary to consider the operation of these methods.1512. Under the method of exclusion, it is provided that, whaj land is excluded for a public purpose, an area equal in extent and i -nearly as possible equal in value should be added. The intention fair-enough,&apos;but it has been represented to us that tribes a often very, jealous of their territory. As one witness put it, thi do not so much consider the land as belonging to them, as tbj they belong.to the land.1513. We,,incline to the belief that a permanent exchange, sui as would he represented by an exclusion of land for a public prfl &apos;pose and a corresponding addition elsewhere, is not a niethf which is likely to appeal to a native tribe, and we are convinej that there are some tribes to whom it would not appeal.1514. When we turn from the point of view of the tribe I that of the individual, the position is even less satisfactory. He ga compensation for disturbance and the use of the added block, whij in all probability will be useless to him, since it is unlikely till he will leave his own relatives and go and live in a place whif in most cases would be far distant from his home, even if the addj block were contiguous to the reserve. It is true that in Kikuyu i might sell or pawn it, but that is certainly not a form of coil pensation which would be acceptable to him. Moreover, he won! object most strongly to the loss of his own land, and woul prefer to keep a reversionary interest in it, however shadowy, rathl than receive alternative land elsewhere.1515. Another serious objection to the method of exclusion] that many of the public purposes are for the direct benefit of
507ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES ht III-Chapter III]lives themselves, and are often undertaken at the expense of the .*.&apos;-?. jcal Native Councils. It would be absurd that, when a hospital&apos; school has been erected largely at the expense of the Local siive Council, the plot should be excluded. There seems to us be something incongruous in excluding a piece of land from the ;reserve merely for the purpose of making a road, or a bridge, or a. nip, or even a township, since all these services are part and ireel of the progress of the reserve. It is most desirable to en-iirage in the natives a civic pride in their roads and bridges, eir social service centres and their townships, rather than to elude them and create the impression of taking away everything licli acquires an exceptional value. We are somewhat doubtful lether the method of exclusion is really suitable in any circum-inces, and shall make alternative proposals in the sections below which we deal with &quot;setting apart&quot;.1516. Even when such undertakings are not exclusively for e benefit of natives, e.g. in the case of a road or a township, ere are strong arguments for keeping the land in the reserve.1517. In spite of the fact that we consider setting apart to be re suitable than exclusion as a means of securing land for public rposes, we are agreed that exclusion should remain a possibility, therefore becomes relevant to consider on what terms it should -j ,allowed. &apos;&apos; :,. .&quot;  .1518. Section 15 of the Ordinance provides that exclusions The Nature; of&quot; a only be made with the advice and consent of the Lands Trust rgSuu^g(jllol&apos;ty jard, and that before such consent is given, it is necessary : (a) berore6; the proposed exclusion should be brought to the notice of the Exclusionsal Native Council and of the natives concerned; (6) that the pj^0takecid Land Board must discuss the matter; (c) that representa-es of the location or section concerned and of the local natives v.-  -icerned must be co-opted on the Board for the purpose of thecussion; and (d) that, if the area is over 200 acres in extent, and2 Local Native Council or the African member or members of theical Board object, the exclusion cannot take place without theisent of the Secretary of State.   If consent is obtained, thelusion takes place by the process of exchange already describedpve.1519. Since we shall make a recommendation in another place put the Local Board should consist entirely of members of the goal Native Council with the District Commissioner as chairman, regard (a), (6) and (c) as suitable, but consider that in view of composition of the Lands Trust Board which we recommend where, (d) should no longer be required. -

We find it regrettable that no recourse has been provide: against a veto by the Lands Trust Board against the exclusion land required for public purposes, since it is one of the fundamental necessities of Government that it should always have the power trj secure land for public purposes by means of Land Acquisition Acti or similar instruments.   In our opinion, some such recourse outditl to have been provided, although we agree that the necessity lot resorting to it should be very rare.1521. We consider that, if land is required for public purposi and if no satisfactory solution can be found either by the method ol setting apart (with or without lease) or by the method of exclusion^ and compensatory addition as provided in section 15 of the Ordin ance, then it should be possible for the Governor to make use ol the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, subject to the approved of the Secretary of State and subject to the Lands Trust Board being consulted upon the terms.   We are convinced that native would prefer that the land should be their land even with the coi dition that the Land Acquisition Act applied (wdiich applies to a other land in the Colony), rather than that it should remain Crow land as it is now.1522. An alternative way of acquiring land for public purpose; is lease. But apart from other difficulties, to which we shall retei later, there appiears to be something incongruous in Governmenl having to take a lease of land in a native reserve, e.g. in order tj build a dispensary entirely for the use and benefit of the natives, And the incongruity is still more marked if the lease is issued t the Local Native Council, wdiich in that case would first hav compensate the right-holders and then pay rent to itself.1523. We may conjecture that it was largely in order to cir cumvent these difficulties that the rules under the Lands Trusl Ordinance, published under Government Notice 531 of the 31 August, 1931, w:ere introduced. Rules No. 9 and 10 are as followsRule No. 9. &quot;If in the opinion of the Provincial Cornmi sioner it is desirable that a specific area in a native reserv should be set apart for the purpose of a trading centre or for school, hospital, or other institution for the benefit of tl: natives residing in the reserve, or for a Government camp o station, or for a police or military post, or for afforestation water supply, or for any other purpose which in his opinion likely to benefit the natives resident in the reserve, be slia cause a proposal to that effect to be laid before the Loci Native Council and before the natives concerned, whose recoil mendations shall be communicated to the Local Board at it.
508ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES T i 11 Chapter 111]next meeting. The report of the Local Board shall be for-uaided without delay to the Central Board for their considera-tion.&quot;Rule A&apos;o. 10.-&quot; When any area has been duly approved and set apart by the Central Board for the purpose of a trading centre it shall be marked out into plots in such manner as the District Commissioner (subject to the directions of the Pro-vineial Commissioner) may direct, and in such case it shall not be necessary to obtain the further sanction of the natives concerned to the grant of any individual lease or licence in respect of a plot situate in such area.&quot;1524. These rules have been commonly interpreted to mean at the area as a whole may be set aside without lease, though uses of individual trading plots in it would be necessary. The provision has already been put into practice in several cases, and , Kikuyu it has been found that strong opposition is evinced by jht-holders to the acceptance of an outright compensation, but iat there is less objection to payment in the shape of an initial sweetener&quot; and thereafter an annual compensation, practically distinguishable from a rent. Evidence given to us by some of le more intelligent natives at Kisumu and in baraza at Murnias idicated that the Kavirondo natives hold the same view. The chief terits which we see in the method of setting apart are : (1) That it raids the anomaly of the Native Council having to pay rent to self; (2) That it secures a whole block for development and com-ensates the right-holders, generally by annual payments, for the Imle of it, so that the area can be subdivided directly by Govern-letit or the Local Native Council without complicating embarrass-tents about compensation having to be considered in the case of ich separate plot; (3) That it preserves the tribal territory as an itejfr.il whole in contradistinction to the method of exclusion.1525. In regard to the authority to be required before land is The Nature o set apart&quot;, we make the following recommendation which is in requi^edb0r&apos;ty mformity with the existing rules. before Land-    - , ^        -   - ,     iii        ii ,    can be Sot1526. The Provincial Commissioner should have the power to Apart.it apart land for public purposes or as a step preliminary to the sue of any lease, which in his opinion is for the benefit of natives silent in the tribal unit concerned, either in respect of the use i which the laud is to be put or because of the revenue to be tpected from rents.

While the rules regarding setting apart may be applie.1roases&apos;1&quot;1 a&apos; to secure tue *and wanted for a trading centre in which the plot-] can then be leased severally, it is more doubtful whether it applh to isolated plots, such as mill plots in the reserve or to ordinan industrial or agricultural leases. But since no lease may be issnec in a native reserve unless the Land Board considers that the issue of it will benefit the natives, and since Bule 9 covers any purpost which in the opinion of the Provincial Commissioner is &quot;likely t benefit the natives&quot;, it seems probable that it could be held to] cover all cases.I52S. However this may be, it would, in our opinion, generally convenient if all leases issued in native reserves shouloj be preceded by the land being set apart, so that the Local native - -&apos;- Council would first make itself responsible for compensating tin]right-holders, before the lease is issued. The lessee would the:;! get a straight lease of the land, specifying the rent payable to th Local Native Council, without any complicating clauses abotij compensating right-holders.&apos; &apos;   1529. Although leases of large areas to private enterprise ura possible under the Ordinance, we understand that only one sucfl lease has actually been carried out. and that was to give effect tj an arrangement already in train before the Ordinance was passed There is every reason to endorse the opinion expressed by three el
509ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES ijni III Chapteb III]lie members of the Hilton-Young Commission, that such leases will ie extremely rare.  It observed in regard to them : &quot; Our conclusion is that, until the natives are sufficiently educated and organized to express a responsible and intelligent opinion, until their requirements in land and the potentialities of the reserves to meet them can be assessed with much more certainty than at present, the leasing of substantial areas of land in the reserves to non-natives for cultivation ought not to be permitted except in very exceptional circumstances.&quot;1530- Apart from the special case of mining lease, almost all eases of small areas in native reserves are likely to be for mission hooks or trading plots or the like.1531. After land has been set apart, it could, where so required, The Nature of subdivided into plots to be leased in conformity with the pur- the Authority dses for which the land was set apart.   The Provincial Commis-  efore^Lancl loner should decide after consultation with the Local Board, pro- can be that the Lands Trust Board or (where it has delegated its Leased, uthority to him) the Chief Native Commissioner should have the sver of veto in respect of the lease of any plot exceeding ten cues in extent.1532. Since we have already recommended in section 1526 bove that the Lands Trust Board should have a power of veto in pect of the setting apart of any land in excess of ten acres, this stra safeguard may be thought unnecessary.  But sometimes the kinds Trust Board might approve of a much larger area being set ,ut, for instance for the institution of some scheme of industrial operation in which non-native capital might play a part.  It is lit that it should retain a measure of control, not only in respect the original setting apart, but also in respect of subsequent ises, in order to ensure that leases are not being granted in such aanner as would involve a departure from the purposes for which ic land had been set apart.1533. There still remain certain difficulties to be considered. Certain etion 10 of the Ordinance provides that, whenever land is leased, difficulties le Board &quot;shall fix the rent at the highest amount that can about Leas08-isonably be expected to be obtained for the land, having regard all the circumstances of the case&quot;.  We consider this provision d rigid.  There are cases in which a low rent with strict better-lent conditions would be preferable.   We consider that the Pro-mcial Commissioner should assess the rent after consultation with ie Local Land Board.1534. Under section 7 (b) of the original Ordinance, it is pro-ided that no land may be leased, unless benefits will accrue to the serve apart from the revenue to be derived.  We fail to see any
Snmmary ol Methods for Acquiring Plo:s for Public Purposes.GeneralRecommenda-tion.ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES part III Chapter 111]reason or commonsense in this clause. It might have the result for instance, that a piece of land of no use to the natives could not be leased for an electric power scheme even at an enormous rental but that a much larger area could be leased for a golf links on the score that caddies&apos; fees will be paid to the natives.1535. Under section 7 (a) of the original Ordinance, no land can be leased if it is being beneficially occupied by the natives, ur even if it is likely to be required for their use and support durinn the currency of the lease. In some of the reserves, notably Kikuyu it would be practically impossible to find any land except barren rock which would be held to be free from these disabilities. But it would be. absurd to hold that land could not be leased to a mission or even a body of natives for a church, merely because a few goats habitually run on it. We think that this clause should certainly be discarded.1536. The. discussion of these methods has been somewhat discursive, and a summitry is necessary.   Several methods hav been discussed for securing plots for public purposes.  One of then namely direct lease, can be omitted, since we have made a recom-mendation that in all cases lease should be preceded by setting apart.  The remaining methods are : (a) Exclusion under section 15 of the Ordinance, entailing theaddition of a compensatory block, &quot;equal in extent, am&apos; as far as possible equal in value.&quot;(b) Setting apart  (with or without lease), plots within thearea set apart being either leased to private persons or bodies or else developed directly by Government, or the Local Native Council for the purposes of some public institution, in which case no lease is necessary.(c) Land acqiusition under the Land Acquisition Act, in which case exclusion takes place on payment of the full value of the land plus 15 per cent, and no compensatory block need be added.1537. It is clear that the public pmrposes for which methods (a) or (c) could be invoked must be public purposes as strictlyI defined.   But method (b) we have decided to be suitable for leases! of all kinds, and not only for those which are required for public! purposes; provided that they must be for purposes which are bene-ficial to natives.1538. Our general recommendation is as follows :1539. We recommend that setting apart should be regarded as the regular method of securing plots for all purposes, including public purposes; for social services; and for trade or industry, etc. But in case the Board should have exercised its veto against this
510ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE reserves ijist HI Chapter III]jnctnod in any particular instance, there should be no other re-lotirse, unless the purpose is a public purpose strictly so called, is declared by the Governor to be so.  In that case, the method[exclusion should be the next recourse. But if the Board will not we to either of these courses (setting apart or exclusion), and a Hillock would otherwise ensue, the Governor should have the nver, as a last resort, to apply the Land Acquisition Act, provided lull the approval of the Secretary of State should first be obtained.1.54.0. This recommendation applies only to Class  A lands, imilar or identical clauses would be required to govern the ac-sitiou of land for public purposes in &quot;B&quot; areas.1541.

ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS JN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Giiapi-er III]at any time that annual compensation should cease, and an outright payment be substituted.(6) That in districts where private right-holding is less de-developed than it is in Kikuyu or Kavirondo, the Provincial Coin-missioner should decide, after consulting the Local Land Board, whether compensation should be under (a) or under (6), or, indeed, whether it need be paid at all (e.g. in the case of a piece of tin-occupied land in an area where no recognizable practice of private right-holding exists). The Local Land Board should be consulted on the assessment of compensation when land is set apart, and if the Provincial Commissioner does not agree, there should be an appeal to the Governor, whose decision should be finaf.(7) That outright compensation should always be assessed on the same basis as if the land were being taken over under the Land Acquisition Act the full value, plus 15 per cent. But if an initial premium has already been paid, as in the case of an annual com-pensation, and it is subsequently desired to convert to an outright compensation, the amount of the premium should be deducted, in so far as it does not represent compensation for buildings or crops.(8) That, except as otherwise provided in sub-section (6) above, the Provincial Commissioner shall assess the compensation after consultation with (a) the local natives concerned, (6) the Local Native Council, and (c) the Local Land Board; provided that, if the Provincial Commissioner and the Local Land Board disagree, the matter should be referred to the Governor, whose decision should be final.(9) That if, after compensation has been assessed, a dispute should arise as to who are the persons entitled thereto, the Pro-vincial Commissioner should cause the amount of the compensation to be deposited in the office of the District Commissioner pending award, but that the setting apart of the plot should not on that account be delayed. The amount deposited should be the whole of the compensation, if it has been decided to compensate under method (u), or the amount of one year&apos;s annuat compensation am! the initiai premium, if it has been decided to compensate under method (b).The Local Native council should have the power to make the award after hearing the representations of the parties, but there should be an appeal to the Provincial Commissioner, whose decision should be final.(10) That in the case of annual compensation the right-holder should keep his reversionary interest; but not in the case of an outright payment.

(6) In respect of land set apart to be developed by leases (e.g. a trading centre) :The Native Council should in all cases be expected to pay the compensation, since it will receive all rents. In the event of the Native Council refusing to do so, the money might be advanced from the Native Better-ment Fund, but in that case there should be a provision for recovering the amount from rents. 1542. The general methods of acquiring land for public pur- Application of )ses or for purposes of social service, trade or industry, etc., have jr^s%ciaItll0dBbeen sufficiently discussed. It remains to consider them in Cases, leir application to special requirements. The cases which must ? mentioned as possessing exceptional features are : (a) School jd Church Plots; (b) Townships; (c) Mining Leases; (d) Other ispects of mining; (e) Control of water; (/) roads and Railways; l&apos;i Native Forest Reserves; (7t) Licences of various kinds.1543. The question of school and church plots in the Kikuyu clmrch^Plots&quot;4 Vovince is discussed at length in Appendix No. 7. We believe nit the study there given of the subject will be useful as a general aide, although it is probable that the arrangements which may e found applicable to other provinces will be less elaborate in ^portion as their system of land tenure is less developed. We ivite attention to the evidence given by the Director of EducationBijV,

In respect oi&apos; the creation and development of socis service centres, trading centres and townships, we recommend tha the basic principle should be that they remain in the reserve and grow progressively out of plots set apart as need arises. As each area is set apart, compensation is paid to the right-holders, if \)[r land is subject to right-holding. Otherwise there is no need to pay compensation, except for disturbance. Compensation to ritrlit holders might either take the form of an outright payment or oi an annual payment after the manner of a rent. In the latter case, there should he a power reserved to buy out for an outright pay. ment when necessary7, in the same manner as if the land were bein&quot; acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, but, though this would buy out the right-holder, the land would still remain part of the reserve.1.545. In the stages before a township is declared, the centre are managed and controlled by the Provincial Commissioner work-ing through his stall, the Local Land Board being consulted whet a lease is issued or when compensation has to be fixed, and Hit Lands Trust Board being consulted when any lease exceeds ten acres in extent; saving that, where the land to be set apart doe not exceed one hundred acres or the land to be leased does not exceed fifty acres, the function of the Lands Trust Board in tin-respect should be delegated to the Chief Native Commissioner (Sec section 1631 below.)1546. At a later stage, the Provincial Commissioner, afte consulting the Local Native Council and the Local Land Board] causes a township (Class II) to be declared, and may then requira the Local Native Council to make due provision, out of the rentj wdiich it receives, for the discharge of landlords&apos; responsibilities (a matter requiring amendment of the Native Authority Ordinance)) At this stage, there is a small township committee with power] to raise conservancy fees and the like.1547. The next stage is that, at the instance of the Provinci Commissioner and with the approval of the Lands Trust Board, township (Class I) may be declared, and the Commissioner of Land would then assume control. The terms and conditions would bt arranged by agreement between Government and the Lands Tins Board, any point of disagreement being referred to the Secretary&apos;.&apos; of State.1548. The contingency that the Board might refuse to agre on any terms acceptable to Government, and that the developmer, of the township might thereby be impeded, is sufficiently met b]

Or, if the jard should still withhold consent, the land could be acquiredijder the Land Acquisition Act, subject to the approval of the eeretary of State.1549. But it may be assumed that normally agreement would reached, and the laud would then remain an integral part of the Wive territory, though set apart as it, township. In such case lansference of control to the Commissioner of Lands would not ifect the primary destination of the rents. They would still be (aid to the Local Native Council, but, as part of the terms, the jotmcil would be required to make an annual contribution from jiein on a percentage basis to be arranged.550. We recommend that all existing townships in native The Question eserves should be held to be townships, Class II, and we are Q.f Comprnsa-atisiied that, except in two cases to be mentioned below, no holders in&apos;6 *&quot; jijustice will result if it is held that within the existing boundaries existing &apos; such townships no private right-holders remain to be compen- Townships, ted either for the reason that all right-holders have already been fficiently compensated or that at the time when the township me into being no system of private right-holding had yet been cognizably established  in  respect of the area covered by the nship.  But if any extension of these townships should ever be quired, it should be on the same conditions of compensation as applicable to townships generally.1551. The two cases which appear to be exceptional are those Two Special Fort Hall and Ivakamega.  In each of these places it so happens Cases, it there are twenty-six huts occupied by persons who claim to e rights in the land on the ground that they were occupying it ore its alienation, and there are also certain natives who have en allowed to come on to it afterwards.1552. We consider that the settlement of any claims which ese natives may have should be as recommended in cases of putting apart (section 15-11 (11) above). The Native Council in each , as the recipient of the rents, should be responsible for paying v compensation in respect of that part of the township which is part for purposes of leasing; it should also pay any compensa-ou due on account of any part developed by Government for the nelit of the natives of the district.   The liability of Government pay from general revenue should be confined to that part of the wnship, if any, which is being developed by Government directly, I by lease, for purposes not connected with the benefit of the lives of the district.

Difficulties of allocation will no doubt arise, as for stance whether the sites occupied by a police parade ground, or post office, or even a tennis court for the use of officers emplove in administering the reserve, are to be counted as land developed ft the benefit of natives or not. We consider that the Provincii Commissioner should make a recommendation, after consultii&apos; the Local Land Board, and that the Governor should decide.1554. Oar own opinion is that in the case of Fort Hall th whole township may be said to exist for the benefit of the native and that the Local Native Council might legitimately be require to pay all the compensation assessed for right-holders, withoi assistance from Government. But since the District Commission is of opinion that an unnecessarily large acreage has been set apai for the township, we suggest that it may be found practicable reduce it in the manner which he recommends in his evident (Evidence, pp. 580, 581), and for any natives who now occupy il township to move on to the land surrendered.1555. If a monetary compensation is paid, we consider that generous assessment on a disturbance basis would be equitable. Tl: fact must be taken into account that at the date when the land w; taken into use as a Government Station, private right-holding w; so undeveloped a conception as to be hardly recognizable, and compensation, if now assessed on the full value of the land, woulj exceed the extent of the true loss sustained.1556&apos;. The case of Eakamega is similar, but, although tlj township has existed in the past almost entirely for the benefit t the natives, its character is already changing to a considerab! degree. The proportion of the compensation to be paid by Coved ment as compared with the Local Native Council should therefor be greater than in the case, of Fort Hall, and perhaps half-and-ha would be a fair arrangement in respect of that part of the townshi which is being developed as a Government Station. But in respei of that part which is to be surveyed into plots for leasing, til Native Council should pay the whole of the compensation, since] will receive the rents.1557. While at the early stages in the development of a tradii centre it is fair that compensation for any land required for ei tension should be assessed on the agricultural value, it is propj that, when it has grown into a township, compensation for further extension should be assessed on a basis which would mall allowance for the enhanced value which the land had acquired account of the proximity of the township.
513ON THE ACQUISITION OE PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES lit III-Chapter III]1558. We have made special recommendations to meet particu- (c) Mining ;ases which have already arisen at Kakamega, or which may Leases-jse before any amending legislation which may be consequent on Report has been effected (vide Sections 1146-1148 above).  We Bill now discuss the question of mining leases, not with any parti-lar reference, but on its general merits.1559. We see no reason why setting apart followed by lease Sonld not be as suitable a method for mining leases as it is for leases, subject to a slight variation to suit the special con-ions of the case.1560. In ordinary leases, the Native Council would receive rents, and so recoup itself for the compensation which it has to to right-holders, and would probably secure for itself a small rgin of profit as a recompense for its services. But under the ding Ordinance it is prescribed that the lease of mineral rights Sh. 5 per acre annually, payable to the Crown.1561. We consider it desirable that in respect of mining all ses of the community should be treated on an equality, as nearly may be.1562. In our opinion, the following arrangement would be fair [all parties :  The first stage is that the Provincial Commissioner, Her consultation with (a) the natives concerned, (b) the Local [live Council, and (c) the Local Land Board, sets apart the land posed to be leased, the method being precisely the same as in ier cases of setting apart (vide sections 1526 and 1541 above).1563. The area having thus been set apart is available to be ed.  We recommend concurrent leases, one issued in respect he mining rights and carrying a rental of five shillings annually able to Government, the other issued in respect of the land la rent to be paid to the Local Native Council.   The initial in respect of the land should be assessed so as to give a fair lomic return on the agricultural value, and should be sufficient eimburse the Local Native Council for its expenditure in com-isating the right-holders, and also to leave a small margin of 1st, both as a general recognition to the tribe and also as pay-it for services rendered.  We also recommend that the lease of land should automatically expire or be renewed on the expiry enewal of the mining lease. In the event of renewal, we recom-that the rental for the land be raised by, say, twenty per If, and that a clause to this effect be included in the original as a condition of renewal.1564. It may be objected that it is not fair to prescribe that e should be two concurrent leases in respect of mining opera-is in native reserves, while one lease suffices in other areas.
An alternative Method. Temporary Exclusion.ON THE ACQUISITION OE PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part 111 Chapter ill]But a landlord on a private estate outside the native reserve has the right to make his own terms with the applicant for a nrininn lease, subject to a recourse to arbitration, and the terms which he secures are likely to be at least as favourable as those which he would have secured by a lease of the land based on its a&quot;ri cultural value.1065. A second objection which might be raised is in regard] to the enhancement of rent on renewal. It may be argued that thej lessor is not entitled to any profit from circumstances arising ou of the success of the. mine. But while we agree that the ainountj of gold won from the mine should not be a circumstance direct! affecting the rental value of surface rights, we consider that the value of land in that neighbourhood will certainly improve because of the better roads, communications, markets, and other amenities which successful mining operations are bound to produce, and these arb circumstances which ought to be taken into account. We therefore consider our proposal to be justified.1566. The contingency must be considered that the Native Council might attempt to frustrate the issue of the lease by refusing to make the compensatory payments. In such case, it should be competent for Government to compensate the right-holders and recover the amount by distraint upon the rents payable to the Local Native Council.1567. As an alternative, we propose a method of temporary exclusion, which could be put into operation in any areas, if the Local Native Council and the natives affected prefer it, and if it found to be practicable in the particular circumstances. Thel operation of the method would be as follows :1568. The area required for the mining lease would first excluded from the reserve and an area equal in extent and as far as possible equal in agricultural value would be added. Any right holders affected would have the option of taking compensation in cash both for disturbance and for the full agricultural value of tht iand, or of taking compensation for disturbance only and going to live on the piece of land added, or, as a third possibility, it might be found practicable, as in the case of Kakamega, that they shouh be given a piece of native reserve forest near their own homes or i piece of commonage not subject to right-holding, so that individual; would be compensated from land already in the reserve, while tin tribe at large would be compensated bv the added block.1569. Compensation for disturbance would include full com pensation for huts and other buildings, for any crops not reaped and a sufficient sum to enable the natives affected to purchase foot for themselves and them families until they should be able ft reap crops from their new land.
51ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES gt I LI-Chapter III]1570. To avoid the difficulty of finding a fresh piece of land add every time a lease is issued, it would, as a matter of prac-ce, be convenient to set aside a block from which the com-nsatory addition could be made as required.1571. The position on termination of the mining lease would rmally be that the land comprised in the lease would revert to e reserve while the block added in compensation would revert the Crown, excepting only such portion of it as might be held be a fair set-off against any part of the area leased which had en permanently impaired by the mining operations. That portion oulil be permanently added to the reserve.(Note. The present obstacle to this method is that there is no provision under the Ordinance for making temporary additions.)1572. After the land has been set apart and arrangements for ying compensation have been completed, the mining lease could issued.1573. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods Comparison of v he summarized as follows :  tho &quot;two80 C*(a) From the point of view of the tribe.- Under the &quot;exclu- Methods, sion method&quot; the tribe loses temporarily, and possibly permanently, an internal area, and receives instead an area external to its former boundaries. The more often this has taken place, the more pock-marked the reserve becomes, and on each occasion it loses an area from which increased rentals may be expected as each renewal of the lease takes place, and in return for it gets a tract of agricultural land in au area which is not so likely to increase in value. Under the &quot;setting aside plus lease&quot; method, the tribal territory remains intact, and the tribe stands to gain largely in revenue.Some of the tribes of Kenya attach immense signi-significance to the integrity of their tribal boundaries, and occasions when they would voluntarily agree to any land being excluded would be extremely rare. As they become more educated in methods of land tenure, it will be possible to wear down the opposition against lease, but the opposition against exclusion is based on what is almost a fundamental article of their tribal faith, namely, that their land is their mother and that they are not at liberty to abandon it.(b) From the point of view of the individual. Under the ex-clusion method, the individual gets compensation for dis-turbance; the use of an area which may often be remote from his own home; and cash compensation for the
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter III]difference in value, if any, between the area lost and the area added. And when the lease falls in, there may be a second disturbance.Under the &quot;setting aside plus lease&quot; method he gets : Compensation for disturbance; annual compensa-tion equal to the fair agricultural rental; with the possi-bility either of ultimate reversion or of being bought out at the full agricultural value, plus 15 per cent; and he continues to live near his own home. Or, if he prefers it, he can take outright compensation, and use it to get himself other land in the reserve or a lease of land in a Class C native area, or in any other way.1574. Two objections mayr be raised : Eirst, that if a native-gets cash compensation he will squander it; second, that he may not- be able to get alternative land to cultivate.The first of these objections may have a certain force against an outright payment, but not against an annual compensation. In any event, the alleged improvidence of natives in respect of money does not seem to be supported by much evidence. Except that they are prone to invest their savings in cattle, they appear in most cases to. be given more to hoarding than to improvident spending. As to the second point, there is no evidence whatever that any native ever has serious difficulty in getting land to cul-tivate, although he often has difficulty in getting land which he may cultivate as a right-holder. This latter consideration is largely of ,a sentimental kind and payment of an annual compensation is a,standing recognition of his right, and he keeps the reversionary interest.(c) From the point of view of general convenience.-Lease isa well-known civilized practice, and it seems to us gener-ally desirable that.when innovations are introduced into a native system.they should be such as will lead it gradu-ally to conformity with more civilized practices. The method of balancing every exclusion with an equal addi-tion has no counterpart in civilized countries; is extremely awkward in practice, and is not so just as it seems, since it ignores the essential factor of the convenience of the person dispossessed.1575: In spite of the fact that the above summary shows every reason to prefer the system of setting apart to the system of ex--clusion, nevertheless we recommend that the latter method should remain a possibility, if ever the people prefer it. There may be -cases in Which ingenuity can suggest a satisfactory solution on those lines, and, in order to satisfy the provisions of the original
PartON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES III-Chapter III]Recommenda-tiona regard-ing Kakamega-(d) Other Matters relating to Mining.-finance, we have sought for such a solution in the case of Kaka-lega in respect of such leases which may already have been issued before action has been taken upon our Report.1576. The particular question of Kakamega has already received itention in Chapter XIII of Part II of our Report (sections 1146 sqq.).,577. We have shown our reasons for thinking the method of Local Option jtting aside plus lease to be far preferable to the method of exclu-Jon, and it is only out of respect for the existing Ordinance that we ive recommended that the latter should remain as a method. But, ing what we have written about Kakamega, we recommend that method of exclusion, as a means preliminary to the issue of ining leases, should never be applied unless there is the clearest issible indication that both the local natives alfected and the Kill Native Council prefer it to the method of setting apart.1578. Suitable regulations for mining leases will contribute to , solution of the land problems created by mining in native serves, but they only cover a very small part of the field.  The sturbanCe caused by prospecting, and by alluvial mining, and by ;ning from claims is incomparably greater than the disturbance ;ely to be caused by the issue of any mining leases which are contemplation.  But while the question of a mining lease is a jightforward problem on which we can recommend with some ilidence, we believe that we may easily do more harm than good we attempt to make precise recommendations on the other jects of mining which would largely have to be based on theory, ce the actual practice of mining and even prospecting in Kenya still in its embryonic stages.   The evidence before us is that her to there has been extremely little disturbance.  There seems only one authenticated case of a hut having been moved, and t was by mutual agreement, and there has been little disturb-:e of cultivated land.  It is generally admitted, and indeed ob-liis, that the natives have gained greatly from the creation of a market for their produce and their labour so near their homes. , 1579. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the presence [some hundreds of Europeans living in a native reserve on no led form of tenure is bound to cause embarrassment, and that [s desirable that it should be regulated. What is more question-is how much regulation ought to be attempted yet.  It may possibly be wise to wait until the situation has developed more experience has been gained before attempting any very mite regulation.
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter ill]1580. Nevertheless, there are aspects of the position which ar serious and may become urgent, and we consider it our duty a least to offer a tabulation of the main difficulties in sight, and t .comment upon them.Prospecting 1581. Under section 13 (i) of the Mining Ordinance, it is proRights. vided that land within a native reserve is excluded from prospectincr occupation under any prospecting right except with the consen of the Native Lands Trust Board in writing. Under section 5 o the Mining (Amendment) Ordinance, it is provided that th Governor, on the written request of the Lands Trust Board, ma appoint Provincial Commissioners as delegates of the Board in thi respect. We can well imagine that the provision that the consen of the Land Board should be obtained in each individual case befor a prospector could prospect in a native reserve proved thorough! unworkable, and that therefore it was desired to make this delega tiou.1582. We believe that it would have been better to go a ste; further, and make Government and not the Board the responsibl authority. The Board is declared under section 14 of the Ordinanc to be the &quot;owner&quot;, and it seems reasonable to regard it as occu pying a position similar to an owner of private land. The rights o a private landowner do not extend to prescribing who may pro: pect or upon what conditions, but he has the right to be com pensated and to appeal to arbitration if the compensation is no satisfactory to him.1583. It does not seem to us just or advisable to go beyond thi point to the extent of requiring the Board to make the condition; The Board re])resents the natives, who are only one of the intereste parties, and therefore its scope ought to be confined to defendin their interests.1584. For these reasons we recommend that Govermnen should be the responsible authority for issuing prospecting licence and prescribing the conditions, but that the Board should hav the right of making representations to the Governor or to tt Secretary of State-Mining from 1585. It is necessary under the Ordinance that, before a ret Reef Claims. c]aini can be granted, there must be a discovery of reef. For eac discovery, ten claims of 20,000 square yards each may be pegge Under the original Ordinance of 1925, export of gold from a claim was prohibited, and therefore, as soon as a claim had been prove it would have been necessary for the holder to take out a lease befor he could export. But under the present Ordinance there is no sue restriction, and everything can be done on a mining claim whic could be done on a mining lease. Although it is issued only for
516tar, it is renewable at will, provided that the conditions are ^served.   There is therefore no inducement to take out a leaseiless it is desired to obtain security for the purpose of raisingpital.1586. A provision that no mining should be allowed off a claim dght tend to cramp development by preventing the holder from [ising working capital; or else it would lead to a multitude of iplications for mining leases on land which might ultimately prove rihless. The natives are compensated for disturbance, the rate yable in the Nyanza Province being a cent a quarter for every wire yard of disturbance, or at the rate of nearly ten pounds r acre per annum. This is not a rule, but is a local standard ;ed by the Provincial Commissioner, to whom all appeals on the jve of inadequate compensation are referable. Consequently, it observed in practice. 1587. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the natives like the ration, and for the general security it is advisable that such uigements should be of short duration. We suggest that mining a claim should be limited to a reasonable period, after which claim should either be surrendered or a lease should be taken1588. The type of alluvial mining which has been in progress Alluvial therto in the Kakamega mining area is panning in river beds. Mining, turns are 100 ft. square, and natives are fully compensated.   If [y native objects to the compensation offered, the District Com-commissioner inquiries into the matter and makes an award; the Pro-icial Commissioner is the final arbiter.I 1589. Since considered  -ations of health may preclude residence (mediately adjoining the claims, the practice is that alluvial claim-ders make arrangements with natives to allow them to reside unoccupied land for a payment, which in Nyanza Province has u standardized at the rate already quoted, together with three llings a month for every non-native resident there in addition the claim-holder.   The payment is normally made to the right-Ider, but if the land is grazing commonage, it is made to the eal Native Council. In this respect the natives are on the same ting as the holders of any private land in the Colony, for ion 15 (2) of the Mining Ordinance authorizes any prospector, 1st engaged in bona fide prospecting, to erect his camp and h buildings or machinery as may be necessary for the purpose [prospecting.1590. We notice that a Bill is before Legislative Council which give Provincial Commissioners power of expelling undesirable [sons, and will create advisory boards by whose advice Provincial missioners will be guided.ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES rabies III-Chapter III]
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVESPart III CnAPTKR III]SpecialAlluvialClaims.Control of Water in Native Reserves.&apos; 1591. We consider the arrangements contemplated to be ade-quate to meet existing circumstances. If it should ever become necessary to set aside areas to be used for residential purposes the provisions which we have already recommended for setting apart could be applied, the Native Council compensating the right-holders and reimbursing itself from rents or camping fees received.1592. We are advised that another type of alluvial mininj may shortly make its appearance. Alluvial deposits of gold are not confined to the river beds, but we are informed that practically the whole of the Kakamega mining area could have been pegged as alluvial, since large quantities of gold detritus are found in the surface soil. It is suggested that applications will be made for the operation of schemes on a large scale for diverting rivers and wash-ing off the surface soil.   .1593. Special alluvial permits may be granted under the headj of Exclusive Prospecting Licences, and are governed by section i(\ of the Mining Ordinance (No. 1 of 1931), as amended by section I of the Mining (Amendment) (No. 2) Ordinance of 1932. Among) the conditions it is provided that the application shall be published! in the Official Gazette for criticism.1594. We suggest that the Lands Trust Board, as the &quot;owner&apos; should receive formal notification of the scheme before it is gazetted for criticism, and should have the right to comment upon the conditions by letter to the Governor or to the Secretary of State. It is further provided in the Ordinance that, in so far as the scheme may entail the use of water, a permit from the Water Authority must be obtained before any water can be diverted ot used. Under the Water Ordinance, it is provided that the Lands Trust Board must be consulted. We shall deal with this aspect oi the case in the sections now following, in which we discuss the proper functions of the Lands Trust Board in connexion with the Water Ordinance.1595. The general water legislation of the Colony is contained in the Water Ordinance (No. 35 of 1929). But this Ordinance has never been applied, and the present practice is that permits art issued under section 145 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, whicf provides against the damming of any spring, river or stream or tht diversion of any water, except under permit or special authoriza-tion. But it is anticipated that the Water Ordinance will eventual!) be applied, though probably in an amended and simplified form.1596. As it now stands, the Water Ordinance limits itself hi -declaring, in section 75, that in any area declared to be nativej reserve its powers &quot;shall be exercised subject to the provisions any law for the time being in force relating to native reserves of
Uimunal reserves&quot;. It therefore becomes in that respect subser-[ieiit to those sections of the Lands Trust Ordinance which relate (lie use and control of water.11507. Section 4 of the Lands Trust Ordinance declares all jtters relating to land in native reserves to be in the unfettered mtiol of the Lauds Trust Board. It seems impossible to escape e conclusion that the control of water which passes over the land likewise in the hands of the Board.1598. But while the Board appears to have an absolute control water during its passage through the reserve, we find no indica-on in the Lands Trust Ordinance that the Board has any standing (whatever in respect of water which has not yet entered the reserve.1.599. If these things are so, it appears to us that the Board s at once too much control and too little.  If the consent of the Hoard is an essential condition before any permit of any kind can ;issued in respect of water in a native reserve, then its power is [early excessive in this respect : the Board, as trustee for nativeilerests, is bound to object if it finds that those interests are juriously affected even in a slight degree; it is not concerned th the interests of the Colony as a whole. For this reason we nsider that the Board ought not to be the final authority. Its addition  is rather that of tnistee for owners who are minors, and rights should be comparable with those of owners on private [ml. In equity therefore it has a right to be notified and to enter ijections, but not to be the final judge of the matter.1600. It seems equally clear that in respect of water which is not yet entered the reserve, the Board has too little power : j In cases where there has been a diversion of water up-river Id loss has been caused to the reserve, we think that the Board ould have the same rights of protecting its lower riparian in-tests as an owner of private laud would have. In cases where an raer of private land would be entitled to sue, the Board should ientitled to sue in the person of the Chief Native Commissioner; id there should be a similar obligation to be sued by owners ttlier down the river.1601. We make no definite recommendation, because an lended Water Ordinance is in draft, and it would be wise to (ait it in its final form before the corresponding provisions of an tended Lands Trust Ordinance are framed.1602. We now turn to the consideration of certain administra-ie difficulties which have been experienced.   The present prac-is that the Lands Trust Board and the Local Board concerned notified whenever any application for a water permit is made tich might by any possibility affect native interests in the reserve.ON THE ACQUISITION OP PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES bjbt III-Chapter&apos; ill] - _&apos;
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part HI Chapter III]Many of these applications are of a petty character. If it is pro vided that the Board must be notified on every occasion and mm have an opportunity to enter objections before action is taken, th more important work of the Board will become clogged with ; mass of petty detail, and there will be unnecessary delay. We an therefore of opinion that a division must be made between &quot;major&apos; and &quot;minor&quot; matters. In minor matters, the Provincial Conunis sioner should recommend, after consulting the Local Land Boan and the local natives concerned; and, if both the Provincial Corn missioner and the Local Land Board approve, then the application should be taken as approved in so far as the native reserve is con cerned. But if either the Provincial Commissioner or the Loea Land Board objects, then the matter should be referred to th Governor for decision. If the Chief Native Commissioner consider the matter to be of sufficient importance to require that the Land Trust Board should be notified, but not otherwise, the decisioi should be deferred until the Board has had an opportunity o recording its opinion.1603. If the matter in issue cannot be classed as &quot;minor&quot;, th procedure regarding the consultation and recommendation should be as before, but the Lands Trust Board should be notified am should have the opportunity of recording its opinion by letter t the Governor, and to the Secretary of State. Decision should res with Government.1604. The difficulty is to find a suitable definition of &quot;major&apos; and &quot;minor&quot;. We shall not attempt it. But it may serve ti indicate the general nature of the distinction which we have ii mind if we say that the criterion should be whether the effect oi the water in the river or stream affected will be of consequence o trivial. It is not a question of capital cost of the work contemplate) but of the result. We consider that the Chief Native commissioner should decide any question of doubt in this respect.1605. We need not go into details or examine every variation of the problem. But we should perhaps allude to two forms o special cases : (a) It might happen that a major scheme is projected higlieup the river, outside the reserve, and that the effect oi the reserve will be very slight. In this case, the project would be held to be minor in so far as the reserve i concerned.(b) It might happen that a large number of irrigation workseach small in itself, is required in one area and that th cumulative effect on the flow of water in a native reserv lower down the river will be serious.  In this case eac
518ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES III Chapter III]separate application would be minor, and would not con-cern the Board, but we consider that the Board should be kept informed of the general position so that it should be able to make representations to the Governor and, if necessary, to the Secretary of State. No useful purpose would be served by the submission of returns, unless the Board calls for them, but the Chief Native Commissioner should have the duty of keeping the Board generally in-formed ; in the discharge of this duty he should be guided by any general or special instructions which the Board may issue.In view of the information which would be supplied to the aid, we see no object in retaining a provision that returns should forwarded to the Secretary of State.1606. It may be objected that these proposals do not give the ud so much power as it has under the Bands Trust Ordinance it now stands. But we are unable to recommend that the arc! should retain a power of absolute veto, which might pi-event proper development or conservation of the water supplies of Colony. The necessary safeguarding of water is, in our nion, a matter over which Government ought to keep a direct ti ol.1607. Under section 15 (i) of the Lands Trust Ordinance, the (/) Roads lernor may at any time, with the advice and consent of the Rtlllway8&apos; jislative Council, exclude from a native reserve any land which y be required for roads or bridges, railways or tramways. 1608. If this method is followed, there is both the general diffi-ty that the reserve becomes fragmented, and the special difficulty t there must an addition of land to the reserve to compensate all the land taken, except the land actually occupied by the ack&quot;, which is specially excluded from this provision. 1609. After consideration, we do not believe that it will ever found necessary or advisable to exclude such land, but that the uirements can be met by a special form of setting apart.  We sider that the whole area required should be set apart by the &quot; ovincial Commissioner, after reference to the Local Land Board h in respect of the area to be set apart and the compensation be paid.   Power would be reserved to the Governor to settle matter in dispute.    The amount of compensation payable nld be assessed as a lump sum.1610. The Lands Trust Board should have no power of veto this respect, but should have the power of making representa is to the Governor or the Secretary of State. There should be obligation on Government to delay construction pending the sideration of any objection.
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III-Chapter III]1611. If a road is classed as a native reserve road, the Nath -Council should provide from its own revenues the full amount i the compensation assessed, and should have the power to determir, the distribution of it to persons injuriously affected.1612. In the case of a main road or a railway, Governrnei should pay the amount to the Native Council as a lump sum, an the Native Council would determine the distribution to persor injuriously affected.1613. In our considered opinion the method of annual eon pensation is not applicable to these cases and compensation mu.-he by payment outright.1614. In order to make our recommendation clear, it is nece-sary to state what we mean respectively by a main road and a natii reserve road. For the purpose of these sections, we consider tin any road should be classed as a main road as soon as it is recognize by the Director of Public Works as a public road for the directio -of which he is responsible; but a road made by the Local native Council on its own initiative should be classed as a native resen road until the Director of Public Works takes it over.1615. If a native reserve road, for which the Local native Council has already paid compensation, is taken over by Govern ment, and a new alignment is made, a question will arise not onl of compensating the right-holders in respect of the land covered b the new alignment but also of Government repaying to the Loca Native Council the whole or part of the money which it paid on in compensation when the original road was made. In such cases we recommend that the Provincial Commissioner should make pro posals after consultation with the Local Land Board, and that such proposals should be considered by the Central roads and Traflii Board, the Governor deciding in any case of dispute.1616. Although we have recommended against the method o excision and compensatory addition in these cases, yet we liav. to consider the possibility that a large extent of native reserve lam might sometimes be put out of agricultural use for the sake of at arterial road in which the natives of the reserve have small interest We therefore recommend that, if the Board considers that tin available agricultural land in the reserve has been reduced by thit means below the amount economically required by the people, it might properly recommend to the Governor that an additional are; be added. The acquisition of such an area to be added to the native reserve should be regarded as a public purpose for which, il necessary, the Land Acquisition Act could be applied. The area -occupied by the road would remain part of the native territory, although subject to the same regulations as are applicable to roads in other parts of the Colony.
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES i ill-Chapter III][617. In order that the Lands Trust Board may be able to rcise a proper, protection, we consider that information should supplied to it concerning the amount of land likely to be taken of agricultural use by any main road which is projected. 1618. Under section 18 of the Lands Trust Ordinance it is (o) Native-vided that &quot;no land in a native reserve shall be declared to be a poiesfc8 st area or demarcated forest without the prior consent of the Reserves, tad Board&quot;.   As to this we agree, since the declaration of a st area would diminish the amount of land potentially available e taken into agricultural or pastoral use, and native interests lit be very seriously affected.  But the section goes on to pro-that &quot;no rule shall be made in respect of any such forest area emarcated forest without the prior consent of the said Board&quot;. It appears to us that the Board, having settled the major issue agreeing to the declaration of the forest, does not need to be stilted further.   Bules for protecting and managing the forest matters of internal administration and control, which, as we 1 recommend clearly in&apos; a subsequent chapter of our Beportr lit to remain in the hands of Government.1619. In section 8 (3) of the Ordinance, it is provided that all ts accruing from &quot;timber or other forest produce&quot; in a native &apos;o &quot;shall be paid to the Local Native Fund or, where there Local Native Fund, to the Native Trust Fund, or may be paid ny member or members of the tribe concerned who may be considered by the Central Board, after reference to the Local id, to be entitled thereto&quot;.1620. The point has been raised by the Conservator of Forests this provision would compel him to pay to the Local Native cil his gross receipts, and that he would then be left without moans to pay staff to administer the forest. It will be many s. and perhaps generations, before the Native Councils, con-ed generally throughout the Colony, will be able to administer own forests, and it is necessary that the Conservator should n the means of control. We therefore recommend that only net receipts, after all liabilities have been met, should be paid le Local Native Council.1621. We may also allude in passing to the curious result h would come about if any attempt were made to interpret section at its face value, and all &quot;profits whatsoever, accruing . from timber&quot; were to be paid to the Local Native Council, Id in abeyance what time the Central Board consults the Local d as to what member or members of the tribe may receive . The quaintness of this provision will be realized when it is :1 that the Kikuyu export round about  15,000 worth of wattle annually, all grown by private owners.
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III-Chapter III]1622. There is a point which has been raised by many nativl witnesses and at nearly all barazas. They represent thafthe native, ought to receive preferential treatment.and that firewood and huildH ing poles ought to be given to them free or sold to them at cheaper rate than to non-natives. We are unable to support thi view. It is the duty of the Forest Department to manage native reserve forest reserves on economic lines, and the Native Count gets the profits. We see no reason to interfere with the discretioi of the Conservator to fix whatever prices he considers proper. W understand that, in point of fact, natives are frequently allowed! have firewood free of charge, and poles are sold to them at a vet] reasonable rate.wi^ktodsf 1623, Section 8 of the Lands Trust Ordinance provides that th Governor, with the advice and consent of the Lands Trust Board may grant licences to &quot;persons not being members of the tribe&apos; in respect of (i) the grazing of cattle, (ii) the removal of tirnbe or other forest produce, and (iii) the taking of sand, lime, stone etc.; but it is provided in section 7 that no such licences may h issued without reference to the Secretary of State if the Loea Native Council or the African member of the Land Board objects.1624. In respect of the issue to non-natives of licences to graz cattle in a native reserve, we do not consider it necessary fof specific reference to be made to the Lands Trust Board on ever occasion. - We recommend that such licences should be issued by tb Chief Native Commissioner or such administrative officers as h may depute.  Many of these licences are of a trivial character, am no good purpose would be served by a provision that returns them should be rendered to the Board, but we recommend thai the Chief Native Commissioner should keep, the Board informed el all important matters, and in the issue of licences should confoniM to any general or special instructions which the Board may issuer We see no reason for any reference to the Secretary of State.1625. We are inclined to recommend that the question whetliel natives of one tribe may or may not depasture their cattle in thl reserve of another tribe should be regarded as a matter betweerf native and native such as would not come under the purview the Lands Trust Board. We have recommended that such matter! be regulated by the native law and custom of the occupant tribi (always supposing that there is no infringement of the quarantinl regulations or other ordinance of the Colony). If native custom does not suffice, and further regulation is required, it can be introj duced by a rule, which would have the effect of modifying supplementing native custom. There would, so far as we can seel lie no objection to such a rule taking the form of providing for thl
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES [bt 111   Chapter III]jue of permits by the District Commissioners in certain circum-aces. Such a provision would impose no greater strain on native ;tom than Would be caused by several of the rules which are leady projected to regulate the gibhaka system, and which would the District Commissioner wide powers, which he would not e had under native custom, for instance a power to order ithaka ie demarcated and registered.1628. We recommend that, subject to any general or special [tractions of the Lands Trust Board, the Chief Native Commis-ier and such administrative officers as he may depute should fe the power to issue licences under section 8 (6) (2) for the aoval of timber.  Such licences may be for very minor purposes, instance a licence to cut one tree for a dugout canoe.  Other Inces might be for very large quantities of timber. In the latter we recommend that the Chief Native Commissioner should, lis discretion, refuse to issue the licence until reference has [n made to the Lands Trust Board.   Presumably, some of the st important licences of this kind would be those issued to the [hvay and its fuel contractors, and it may therefore be necessary reserve a power to the Secretary of State to override the veto [he Board, if it should have the effect of depriving the Railway tital supplies.1627. In respect of licences under section 8 (6) (3) for the joval of sand, lime, stone, etc., we have to remark that these often of a trivial character, and it seems quite unnecessary the Lands Trust Board should normally be troubled with them, consider that the Brovincial Commissioner should have the ^er to issue such licences, and to delegate such powers to District nnissioners. We would not even make it statutory for the LocalIive Council or the Local Land Board to be consulted, although tight be a matter of administrative direction that they should lonsulted in all save trivial cases.1628. We consider that the protection of native interests in lect of all classes of licence mentioned in this section would be ntately secured by the following procedure : (a) Licences for the purposes contemplated in section 8 of the Ordinance to be issued by the Provincial Commissioner; or by the District Commissioner, if the power is delegated to him by the Provincial Commissioner.(b) An administrative direction to be given, in such detail as may be thought necessary, that licences should not be issued without prior consultation of the Local Land Board and of the natives concerned, except where the amount of loss or disturbance likely to be caused is, in the opinion of the issuing officer, trivial.

We realize that licences would generally be issuei before u&quot;he Lands Trust Board hears of them, except ii important cases referred to it by the Chief Native Com missioner. We view this position without misgiving, be cause we are confident that the Chief Native Commis sioner would refer cases m which reference is desirable If it should occasionally happen that a licence is issues to which the Board would have objected, the objection of the Board would be valid against renewal.)1629. In the foregoing recommendations we have endeavourei to provide protection for native interests without so hedging thi position about with safeguards that the freedom of Government h develop the reserves to the best advantage would be seriouslj impeded.1630. Before concluding this chapter, we wish to allude brief!; to two matters which are of considerable importance to the smooti working of our recommendations in respect of the acquisition c: plots hf native reserves. They are : (a) Delegation ; and (b) Survey1631. In respect of the setting apart of land and in respect o the leasing of land we have recommended that the Lands Tnrs Board have a power of veto, if the land to be set aside or lease: exceeds 10 acres. We do not consider that it should be neeessan to trouble the Board with every case in which it is proposed ti set aside or let land above ten acres, and we propose that tin
ON THE ACQUISITION OF PLOTS IN NATIVE RESERVES ,,T 111 CnAPTEit III]oanl should have the power to delegate to the Chief Native Com-commissioner the power of assenting on its behalf to the setting apart land up to one hundred acres, or the leasing of land up to y acres. If the Chief Native Commissioner should feel himself able to assent to the lease or the setting apart in any case, he aid refer the matter to the Board with his recommendation.1632. These provisions would obviate the necessity of ordinary niiig leases having to be referred to the Board, and would relieve of all save important matters.1633. We are amply satisfied that too many safeguards would feat their own end. It is the broad aspects of native land policy which the protection of the Board is principally required, and consider that it would be a mistaken conception of its duties if it thought that it is called upon to exercise a constant vigilance er the actions of Government in routine matters. 1634. We do not consider it necessary that land should be Survey veyed before it is set apart, but that a suitable and cheap de-rcation on site should suffice, and a simple record should be t in the District Commissioners office. Similarly with leases areas for such purposes as school and church plots, or for trading ts or mill sites, we do not consider survey necessary, but any ty desiring to have the plot surveyed should pay for it. But it 1 probably be advisable that survey should be required in the e of leases to non-natives, when the plot exceeds a certain nimum. sav, fortv acres in extent.
pCHAPTER IV.Crown Land or Native Land.A Proposal stated for Discussion.LAND TENURE BY NATIVES IN THE RESERVES.1635. The point has been raised by several native witness and sometimes as a general opinion of natives assembled in bum, that native reserve land should be conceived as belonging to I natives and not to the Crown. The legal position, as laid down the &quot;Barth Judgment&quot; of 1921 (Original Civil Case 626/19: reported in Vol. IX, East Africa Law Reports, pp. 102-105), is tl as a result of the Kenya Order in Council, 1921, combined with t Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915, it is Crown land, and that the le: position of the native is that lie is only a tenant at will of t Crown. But it is clear from contemporary despatches, and esj cially from Sir Henry- Belfield&apos;s Despatch No. 144 of 25th Augn 1914, that this legal position was only created in order that nati rights might be the better safeguarded and defined.1636. This legal position has never been popular with native and, without going into the question whether the Crown Lat Ordinance, 1915, was a competent instrument to do what it p; -ported to do, it must be admitted that to deprive a man of 1 rights in land for the sake of protecting him is a method procedure which is liable to be misunderstood.1637. We have therefore given consideration to the questi whether these measures were necessary or need now be continue163S. Eor the purpose of examination, we state the follow: proposition :1639. That the native lands as a whole (Class A) be not sty Crown land but Native lands, the nuda proprietas being deen to lie with the native population generally, but vested in a tr and subject to the sovereignty of the Crown and its general pow of control. The rights of particular tribes, groups, farm! and individuals should be covered by a declaration that they si have all the rights and powers in respect of land which they lit under native custom (as it is, or as it may become), in so far they are not repugnant to the Lands Trust Ordinance or re under it, or any other law or ordinance of the Colony.1640. We have not attempted an exact drafting, but the nix description should suffice to make the meaning of the proposili clear.

The twofold nature of the Trust, as being partlyprotective1&apos; and partly, &quot;constructive&quot; in character, and the dis-jmtion of functions between the Lands Trust Ordinance and the liniment are matters which we shall discuss in the next jipter.)Kill. Before recording our recommendation, it is right toIisider possible objections. Certain objections have been brought our notice, which deserve consideration.1642. The first objection is that, although the rights of theinvn might seem to be adequately safeguarded, some flaw might detected, and it might be found that the Crown had parted with tits essential to the proper control and guidance of land tenure ong primitive peoples.1613. It is even conceivable that, although the wordinjr of the (use itself might be completely adequate, its validity might be (tested on the ground that the native rights which it seeks to itiol pre-exist the Lands Trust Ordinance and are independentit.1644. We are of opinion that this objection can be adequately It ii the position is clearly defined and safeguarded by Order in jttneil. We agree that it is absolutely essential that Government Ink! have the power to control and direct, and, where necessary, fiiodify the system of land tenure, both in respect of the acquisi-of land for public purposes and for purposes of trade and de-bpment, and also in respect of the tenure of land as between jives themselves. It would be necessary that the Order in Council make this abundantly clear.1615. The second objection which is urged against the proposal [that natives are unable to understand the distinction between pal ownei-ship of land and tribal sovereignty.   This difficulty particularly marked among the Kikuyu, and we have already ficled to it.  Administrative officers who know the tribe are piehensive that, if the land is called native land, the natives interpret the position in the sense that they are, as it were, Separate entity independent of the Government of Kenya, but jmitting to a temporary tutelage.  We believe this apprehension )e very well grounded.  But we do not regard the objection as iperable, since it ought to be possible for a declaration to be le in unmistakable terms which would make it clear that His jesty King George (and his successors in title) is the sovereign ir of the whole country, and that the native land remains an Jgral part of the Colony in all respects.Criticism of the Rropoaoi.
ON LAND TENURE IN NATIVE RESERVES Part 111-Chai-ter IV]Reeonimenda-tion.Tribal vs. Individual Tenure.Alteration of Custom.1646. We consider that the dislike of the natives to the lai being called Crown land is natural. They cannot understand th it is largely a conveyancing measure, and they believe that would be more secure if the land is called native land.1647. We foresee that any conveyance of the land in freeho or otherwise to the natives would cause great complications, would, for instance, be extremely difficult to distinguish betve, the rights enjoyed by a tribe and by the individual members groups of which the tribe is composed.   In order to avoid t difficulty, it is suggested that there should be no conveyance, that those sections of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915, and Kenya Order in Council, 1921, which, in combination, were i dared by the Barth Judgment to have had the effect of making the land Crown land, should cease to be operative in respect any land in the Native Reserves, Class A. so that the tenure wot revert to its former condition, subject to the sovereignty of t Crown.   This would create a state of affairs in which - the la might properly, though somewhat vaguely, be called native land.1648. While such a position might cause concern to perso: who set store by precision of definition, we see no advantage attempting to define in terms of English jurisprudence conditions native tenure to which they are inapplicable. The practical poi is that it should be possible for a system of landdiolding to built up from a basis of native custom, and we need not conce ourselves with abstruse questions of ultimate proprietorship.1649. After considering all these points, we recommend : That the rights of the Crown to control and dispose must be adequately safeguarded in every respect; (b) That it must be ma perfectly clear to the natives that the Crown has these rights; I That Class A land be called native land : and (d) That the positii be declared and safeguarded under an Order in Council.1650. On the question raised on the first term of referee: whether the tenure of land should be tribal or individual, recommend that the tenure of each reserve should be built on ; basis of the native custom obtaining therein, but that it should progressively guided in the direction of private tenure, proceed; through the group and the family towards the individual holding,1651. While we do not consider that either the Native Couni or the Native Tribunals should have the power to alter custom respect of the tenure of land, we can see some utility in the that Council having the power, subject to the prescribed sanctions, make a formal declaration that custom has become altered in respect.  In this way, when a change in practice has been adop

But the institution of settled Government, the fixation boundaries, the introduction of money, the increase of popula-n, and the general industrialization of the country have caused dare causing profound changes and even disintegration of native vand custom.

Some witnesses, notably Dr. Leakey and Mr. McGregor xiij, have stressed the dangers of attempting to introduce modifica- t*l ..3 into a native system by rule.   We fully appreciate those ngers and realize that, even when the ground has been exploredexhaustive study and the utmost caution has been exercised, c rules will have unexpected repercussions and many mistakes 11 be made. Nevertheless, we are impressed in an even greater gree with the certain misery which will result if a policy of drift pursued.1654. Comparative study of the difficulties encountered in other countries should enable Government to foresee and guard against ngers which are hidden from the natives. Fragmentation both land-holding and of cultivation (an evil which in many parts of dia has proceeded so far as effectively to defy all attempts at momic cultivation) is already becoming marked in Kikuyu and its of Kavirondo, and threatens to become acute in Southern kuyu within a generation.1655. It is futile to imagine that an undirected mass evolution a solve the many new problems, which have resulted from settled vernment and the impact of an industrial civilization on a imitive people, and are entirely outside the range of tribal ex-experience.

Great caution will be needed in the making of rule;&apos; It is important, in so far as it may be possible, to prepare the wa by education and experiment. But native opinion will always l; conservative and slow to appreciate the need for changes of whirf ti. has no experience. The need may be urgent, and therefore j will sometimes be necessary to introduce rules even against tli weight of public opinion.   But such a step would only be justifie- after the most careful consideration, and the natives are entitled t be protected against the possibility of rash or ill-considered reforms1657. We therefore recommend that, when representation have been made to the Provincial Commissioner that rules ar necessary, they should first be debated at a District Commissioner; meeting, the Provincial Commissioner presiding, and a record c the discussion should be kept. reference should then be made t the Local Native Councils and the Local Land Boards concerned and records of their discussions should also be kept. The rule should then be debated a second time by the District Commissionet in the light of the criticisms received. The draft rules should the: be sent to the Chief Native Commissioner for discussion at Provincial Commissioners&apos; meeting, and then to the Governot together with the records of all these discussions and the Provineis Co mmissioner s recommendations. P^ie Governor should then hat the power to gazette the rules. Notification should be sent tn tl Lands Trust Board, and a power of disallowance should lie wit the Secretary of State.1658. Even after they have been gazetted, the rules should tit be automatically applied, but the Provincial Commissioner shoul have the power to apply them or any of them, by further tiotit in the Official Gazette, either to the whole province or to an district or to any part of a district.1659. We are aware that the course recommended in respa of debate and discussion would probably be pursued as a matt-of practice, even without any statutory provision to that effec But the natives will feel more secure if the procedure to be oi served is fully set out in the Ordinance.1660. The provision that the niles may be applied in the tit&apos; instance to a part of a district should prove very useful in sat matters as the registration or demarcation of right-holdings, whet ever such a step may become desirable. Small flaws in the arrangi ments will probably be found when they are applied in practici and will mor-e easily be rectified if the rules are first tried out in comparatively small area.
524ON LAND TENURE IN NATIVE RESERVES [II-Chapter IV]661. We do not consider that it concerns us to indicate in The partienlar what particular rules are required. If we had regarded that &quot;uloere^u&quot;ed--t of our duties, we should have had to spend some additional is in taking evidence.   We have, however, made several ms to what we regard as the most important matters (vide as 501-535 above).662. We record no very definite opinion regarding the advisability- Registration of a register of right-holdings in any particular area.   In tjon of itig^t-districts of the Colony such a step would quite obviously be holdings, iture.  We note that both the Kikuyu Land Tenure Report he North Kavirondo Land Tenure Report were in favour of a er, but we have evidence to the effect that, after further, ies, administrative officers in North Kavirondo are - agreed   ;,    , no steps in that direction are at-present practicable in that :m,Tie weight of the native opinion as expressed to us, both in i and Central Kavirondo, was clearly against a register, al- -&apos; li the Kavirondo Taxpayers&apos; Welfare Association and a few s held a contrary opinion (Evidence, pp. 2139-21-11). Opinion in Kikuyu Province appears to be more open. Some sed rules for the regulation of ithalta were drafted by the late Native Commissioner (Mr. G. V. Maxwell), and we, note that a seventh draft rule it is stated : &quot; When directions have been 1 by the District Commissioner; for the marking out of the furies of various ithaka; he shall establish a register, to be i as the Githaka Register.&quot; The District Commissioners, in ing this matter, proposed to alter &quot;shall&quot; to &quot;may&quot;. 653. The only opinion which we wish to record on this point t, while we have not enough evidence before us to say whether ister of ithaka is or is not desirable at present, we regard a ious advance towards private right-holding to be..generally ihle, if land is to be developed to the best advantage., and we dined to think that the experimental introduction of a register part of the Kiambu district on the lines recommended in the rules would be of value. .   .1664. But demarcation on site is certainly more valuable at lage than registration, and we call attention to the suggestions, h have been made to this end, especially to the rules -proposed Mr. Maxwell. We take this opportunity of saying that the 3 of demarcation should be simple, and that the employment veyors in native&apos;reserves should seldom, if ever, be necessary p.--..-;. . -&apos; present conditions as regards native holdings. : &apos; &apos;&apos;     -&apos; &apos;-
ON LAND TENURE IN NATIVE RESERVES Part III Chapter IV]sSettlomen b of Disputes.Rights of Protection in Respect of Trespass.Use of Areas added to the Reserve.1665. We consider that a good case exists for the application of rules to extensive parts of the Kiambu district ordering th demarcation of ithaka; of right-holdings; and possibly of tenant holdings by some simple distinctive method. There is ampf justification for selecting this district for exceptional treatment since the accident of position as the well as the peculiarities of it customs and traditions of land-holding render its problems excr tionally difficult. The aspirations of these natives towards a nior individual form of tenure deserve to be fostered, under adequat safeguards, and the lessons learnt here will afterwards be of valu to other native areas as they also begin to advance in the directio of private ownership.1666. Disputes are at present settled under the machinery pr vided by the Native Tribunals Ordinance, and we recommend r, change.16G7. We believe it is a fact that a tendency has lately bee evinced in some districts, notably Kiambu, for natives to treat th presence of Europeans in the reserves as if it were trespass. Case have occurred in which Europeans, who have been peacefully fish ing in the rivers, or picnicking on unfenced land, or even walkii or motoring on the roads, have been challenged by natives art told they have no right to be there. We consider that while native are entitled to protection under the ordinary law of trespass again: trespass on fenced land, any person should be entitled to procee along any road, track, or footpath, or even any unfenced uncull vated land, and to picnic or camp on any unfenced land not plants in seasonal crops, provided that any damage is made good, art that non-natives should not camp in the same place in tlie resen for more than forty-eight boms without a permit from the Distri Commissioner. We consider also that fishing should be allowe in all rivers and from the banks of all rivers in the native reserve subject to the possession of a fishing permit and subject to the la of trespass.1668. Judging from the evidence which we have received, \ believe that ft is necessary that the position should be clearl defined in the Ordinance or by rules under it.1669. We wish to invite especial attention to our recommend tions in Chapter XV of Part I of our Deport, in which we reco 1 our opinion that areas added to the Kikuyu Eeserve should ee tainly not be used as grazing commonages, but that the land shoal pass into private ownership by groups or individuals (sections 51 547).1670. To some extent these remarks will be found to apply other reserves besides Kikuyu, and the emei-gence of private rigli is generally to be encouraged.  We wish to record a comprehensi.

CHAPTER V.Object of the CTiapcer.The respective functions of the Lands Trust Board and the Administrn-tion.THE APPROPRIATE METHOD FOR THE PROTECTION. ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL OP LAND IN NATIVE RESERVES.1(571. In the foregoing chapters we.have made a number 01 recommendations regarding the protection, management, admini tration, control and development of land in native reserves, and it will have been noticed that we have regarded certain functions as being appropriate to the Provincial Administration and the Govern-inent generally, and others to the Lands Trust Board. The object of the present chapter is to show the basis on which this distinction is drawn; to summarize the duties on each side; and, finally, to make our recommendation as to the constitution of the Lands Trust Board.1672. The general basis of the distinction is that the responsi-bility of the Lands Trust Board should be to fulfil the protective need, and that of the Administration to discharge the requirements of the constructive need.1673. These needs are respectively defined in the letter ap-pended to the Report of the Hilton-Young Commission addressed to the Secretary of State on the subject of the Lands Trust Bill, and signed by Sir R. Mant, Sir G. Schuster, and Mr. J. H. Oldham, where it is stated : &quot; The first and principal need, which may be described as the &apos;protective need&apos;, is to fix the areas to be set aside, and provide secure protection for the preservation of the beneficirights over such areas to the natives.&quot; The second and almost equally important need, whichwe will call the &quot;constructive need&apos;, is to provide for theactual use of land in such a manner as will be of the greatestbenefit to the natives.&quot;1674. A division of functions in this way does not simply mean that the Lands Trust Board is responsible for protecting the bound-aries and the Administration is responsible for whatever happens inside them. . Internal development undertaken by the Administra-tion in pursuance of the constructive need might have aspects which require that the protection of the Board should be invoked to safe-guard the rights of groups, or families, or individuals affected. We have therefore endeavoured to secure to the Lands Trust Board all

In the course of our examination, seriatim, of the various Duties of the Joblems, we have already stated our recommendations regarding y^&quot;^ Trustduties proper to the Lands Trust Board in each case. We shall liw state them in summary form.1076. Great care is taken under the Ordinance that the total (i) In respect a of the reserves shall never be diminished.  To this end, they pv^ct-10n 0f vested as a trust in a Lands Trust Board, whose duty in this Boundaries, anexion is merely to preserve the boundaries intact.   There is -a provision that the boundaries may be extended (under sec-n 2 (2) of the Ordinance), but this is done by the Governor, object to the approval of the Legislative Council, and the Board not concerned except to the extent that, once the land has been led, it becomes part of the trust. In respect of exclusions, for rich provision exists under section 16 (i) of the Ordinance, the arc! has a more active function, and exclusions cannot be made less the Board advises and consents. But we have already ex-ssed the opinion that the method of exclusion would generally unpopular, and resort should seldom, if ever, be had to it.1677. We have contemplated (section 1539) that very excep--,al cases might occasionally arise in which land is required for important public purpose, and no satisfactory method can be nd for securing it either by exclusion or by setting apart.   In cases, we have recommended that it should be possible, on direction of the Secretary of State, for the provisions of&apos; the pel Acquisition Act or similar legislation to be applied.  In such le. the Land Board would express an opinion but would not have final voice.   But it is expected that such cases would be of remely rare occurrence.167S. It is admittedly a weak point in the Ordinance that no ichinery exists for making exchanges, but even when an amend-it has been introduced to allow for them,  they will be of paratively rare occurrence. It is true that at the moment there a number of small exchanges to be conducted, but they arise tly from misconceptions or errors which were brought to light the survey of the boundaries, and, when once they have been ilied, subsequent changes would seldom be needed and could erally be by mutual lease. We have recommended (section 1475) exchanges by means of exclusions and additions should not be e unless the Board agrees.

In respect of exchanges by mutual lease and in respect extensions of boundaries by lease, we have recommended, amongl other safeguards, that they shall not take place unless the Board! agrees (section 1474).1680. We have recommended, among other safeguards, thatI no land in excess of ten acres shall be set apart or leased except! by agreement of the Board, but that the Board should be able to] delegate to the Chief Native Commissioner the power of assenting on its behalf to the setting apart of land not exceeding 100 acres,I and the leasing of land not exceeding 50 acres (section 1631).1681. The Board would have the power to issue general special instructions for the safeguarding of native interests which! would be affected by the granting of licences for the purpose! specified in the Ordinance, but, subject to such instructions ami to the safeguards stated in section 1628 above, the duty of issuing or refusing any particular licence would rest with the Adminis-tration.1682. In respect of licences connected with mining, the Board would not have a power of veto, but should be able to making representations to the Governor, or to the Secretary of State. In the case of special alluvial claims, we have recommended tha formal notification should be sent to the Board before the scheia is published in the Gazette for criticism (section 1594).1683. In the case of water permits, we have recommends that applications be divided into major and minor, and that refer ence to the Board in minor cases should be unnecessary, except a: the instance of the Chief Native Commissioner. In major case reference should be made to the Board, which should have tl: power to object and to make representations to the Governor or the Secretary of State, but should not have the power to decide, Details of this recommendation are given in section 1602 above.We have made a further recommendation, at section 160 above, that the Board should be capable of suing or being sued matters affecting riparian interests.1684. Besides the protection which the Lands Trust Boat would be required to extend to the natives in the particulars er merated above, we conceive that the terms of the trust, dedicatinj the land to the &quot;use and benefit&quot; of the natives, imply that tli trustees must have the power to assure themselves that the land actually being devoted to the purposes for which it was assignei Therefore, although we shall recommend that the internal inanagt ment, development, administration and control of the native landBjT
527ON METHODS OF PROTECTION AND CONTROL ipim III-Chapter V] _should rest, as it were in a separate trust, willi Government, and (lull Government should have the sole responsibility in respect of [he &quot;constructive need&quot;, we shall nevertheless recommend that the Lands Trust Board should have the power and duty of making [^presentations to the Governor, and, if necessary, to the Secretary If State, if it considers that the land is not being devoted to the use [nil benefit of the natives in conformity with the terms of the trust r is not being properly conserved and developed.1685. The above enumeration shows the duties proper to the QllaIltiesm ^ i.   i i     -i      m, -n  necessary inIs Trust Board as protector of the native lands. Ihey will the Lands Irani time to time include the consideration of extensions, exclu- Trust Board, lions, exchanges, major leases, and important licences. But, taken jnsum, the work is not arduous, and the occasions will be rare when liactical issues arise for settlement. The chief requirements in any Board which is appointed as trustee in this regard, i.e. for conserva-iion as apart from development, are independence and a sense of Justice. No high degree of local knowledge is required; and the one Issential point is that the Board shall command the respect and Jonfidence of the natives and of the Colony at large.1686. In order that this might be secured to the fullest extent, iir Edward Grigg had envisaged the position when the duties of he Board would &quot;pass by general agreement into the hands of a uglier East African authority&quot;. It is a point for consideration Aether it is necessary that the members of the Board should eside in Africa at all. We shall defer our recommendation on this natter for the moment, until we have reviewed the requirements of he constructive as well as the protective need, and made good our ontention that the matters of internal development and control re the duty of Government and not of the Lands Trust Board.1687. The conditions obtaining in native reserves in respect The Require-f the use of land have been comprehensively summarized in the internal ret chapter of this part of our Report. It would be quite impossible Management or anybody to read that chapter and not be convinced that the and Contro&apos;-^management, development, administration, and control&quot; of native kinds is a most complicated task, requiring great local knowledge, dininistrative skill, patience and experience, and much study.  The eed for caution and the need for energy are equally obvious, and bove all, perhaps, the need for authority.  The whole machinery of dministration must be called in, and it would be quite impossible p a Lands Trust Board to attempt to deal with the matter except firough the Provincial Commissioner.   But the Provincial Com-Jtissioner and his officers cannot serve two masters, and it is not Practicable to effect a strict division between their functions as
ON METHODS OE PROTECTION AND CONTROL Part III Chapter V]land development officers and the rest of their duties. For instance orders given under the Native Authority Ordinance for the con struction of roads or bridges, or to prevent the wasteful destruction! of timber, or to regulate the movements of natives from one location to another, relate, in some sense, though not exclusively, to the management and control of land. It would be ridiculous to expect the Provincial Administration to conduct all these matters in sub-ordination to the Lands Trust Board.1688. The difficulty is still more obvious when we consider i in its political aspect. A dispute about land, especially in Kavi rondo, often involves a location boundary, and the political sphere of a heamaiPs control is as much in the argument as the question of land to be used and cultivated. The conception of land tenure has barely yet emerged to a point at which it can be distinguish^ from political control, and power and proprietorship are still largel confused. It is obvious that the settlement of disputes of this kine must rest with Government directly, and no Land Board should h expected to take the responsibility.16S9. If one regards the matters from the judicial aspect andl considers the settlement of land disputes between natives, the samef conclusion is reached. These disputes are heard in the Native Tribunals, and under the existing Ordinance the Provincial Com-I missioner is the final court of appeal. It would be an impossible! position if, after having given a judgment in one sense in a dispute, he then had to take action in an opposite sense at the direction ot the Board, which might differ from him in opinion. It is easy to say that such a position would never arise, but natives are adepts in playing off one authority against another.1690. On all these grounds we are satisfied that the manage-ment, development, administration and control (to use the words employed in sections 4 and 6 of the Ordinance) should remain with the Administration in respect of all matters arising between native! and native in the reserves. The direct authority would be the] Provincial Commissioner, and his responsibility should be Government, and not to the Board.General State-        1691. The conclusions which we have reached, and which arejrnent of the    supported by the above arguments, are as follows :  Conclusions. j o(i) The duty which Government has towards the natives protect them in the use and enjoyment of their land hasj two essential aspects :  (a) Conservation of the reserves generally for their inhabij tants; the safeguarding of the integrity of the boinil daries; and the protection of private rights.
528ON METHODS OK&apos; PROTECTION AND CONTROL iht III-Chapter V](b) Management, development, administration and control of the land with a view to improvement.(ii) The aspect of conservation may appropriately be entrusted to a Lands Trust Board, the chief requirements of which are that it should be independent and just, and should command universal confidence. , It need not have special local knowledge.(iii) All power of management, development, etc., must be pre-served in the hands of Government, the immediate auth-ority being the Provincial Commissioner, working through his staff.  His responsibility must be to Government, but for  the  better  safeguarding  of  native  rights  certain powers of veto and representation must be secured to the Lands Trust Board. 1692. We have left the question of the personnel of the Board Personnel of nlil last, because it seemed logical first to review the duties which TriisVuoarcl ave to be performed.   We can see nothing in the list of duties hich demands of necessity that the Board should have close local nowledge or should necessarily be resident in Kenya.1693. The present constitution of the Board is determined by etion 3 of the Lauds Trust Ordinance, which provides a mem-ership very like that of the Executive Council.  Some of the wit-esses before us, who are members of both these bodies, have mitted that they experience a difficulty in attuning their minds the capacity in which they are acting at the moment, especially lien a case arises in which &apos;the advice they have to tender to overnment in their official capacity, after taking all aspects of e matter into account, does not correspond with the attitude hich they have to adopt as trustees considering only the native lerests.  We do not consider that any official should be placed in eh a position.  Nor, when we. reflect that occasions may arise in hich the native reserves may have to be protected even against e Government of Kenya, do we think it right that the Board of rastees should correspond so closely with the Executive Council, e are most strongly in favour of an independent Board in all atters relating to the protection of the native reserves, although e agree that matters of internal administration and development only remain in the hands of Government.1694. We believe that public confidence in the Board will be eater if the members have no direct concern with the political e of the Colony. But it would difficult to find in Kenya men of linence and distinction who are not already involved in some ty or other in politics, which, in so small a community, are ost a part of daily life. We do not say that such men could not
ON METHODS OE PROTECTION AND CONTROL Part III Chapter V]be found, but they would have to be chosen from an extren.eh[ limited field, and that in itself might tend to some extent to inipaj,! their authority and the confidence reposed in them. j.1G95. A further consideration is that members of the Board I will be, in a sense, the representatives of the Privy Council, sincf 1 they will be the protectors of a trust, of which, as we recommend 3 an Order in Council would declare the principal terms and nominate the trustees. They will therefore, as carrying out the duties im posed on them by the Privy Council, be to that extent represents. I fives of Government, though independent of the Government o Kenya. They would be able in certain specified classes of cases should occasion arise, to interpose a veto on leases or licences which! the Government of Kenya had recommended to be granted. If then members of such a Board are resident in Kenya, the position, ill not actually embarrassing to Government, would certainly be river\B hard for the natives to understand, and would be more likely til bewilder them than inspire confidence. The point of greatest im! portance is that the Board should command the confidence of thfl natives, and it is essential that it should be removed from tlvH sphere of local politics. If it is resident in Kenya, there is alway! the danger that interested parties will make capital out of the con! tention that there are too few, or too many, natives or settlers cm officials or missionaries on the Board. Without wishing to laborrH the point, we do not think that it can be denied that a BoaroB consisting of trusted and impartial men resident in England would! carry more weight than a Board resident in Kenya.1696. The strongest objection which we have heard urgedB against such a Board is that it might lack the means of discovering whether the reserves are in fact being conserved and utilized fcfl the use and benefit of the natives. It is, for instance, the case than some native tribes bid fair to render their reserves quite unfit tfl support human life if they continue their practice of overcrowdinfij them with herds of useless live stock. It is represented that thfl trustee, even on the protective side of the trust, should not allovH such a state of things to occur without protest, or without malrinfl representations, if Government fails to deal with the situation! We consider that the Board is entitled to inform itself of thfl situation, and we recommend not only that it should receive periodifl reports from Government on any matter affecting the condition cfl the trust, but also that it should be able, if it ever conceived it to ffl necessary, to appoint representatives to inspect and report to I directly. If this recommendation is accepted, we are of opinion thfl the objection disappears.
ON METHODS OF PROTECTION AND CONTROL jjijBi III Chapter. V].697. We think that the advantages and disadvantages of a jgoard in England and of one in the Colonies are fairly evenly Juiced, except for the much greater confidence which a Board in Jjjigland would enjoy in the eyes of the native unless natives were be members of it.  We are definitely of the opinion that many his must elapse before a class of Kenya-minded natives has grown rfrom whom it would be possible to select fitting representatives ; members of a Board which has to deal with the interests of the iitives. of Kenya as a whole.  For these reasons, we are inclined ii the view that a Board in England would be preferable, and Ir. Hemsted would make it a definite recommendation.We recommend that the Order in Council which defines the list should also nominate the trustees, providing at the same time it the method of succession and other matters relevant to the intment.
CHAPTER VI.THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCEThe Term of 1G98. The term of reference is as follows :-Reference.&quot; To review the working- of the Native Lands Tr.. Ordinance, 1930, and to consider how any administrative difficulties that may already have arisen can best be    It whether by supplemental legislation or otherwise, withe I involving any departure from the principles of the sa Ordinance.&quot;The Principles        1699. The first question which we have set ourselves to answ rf.rie0 ^        &apos;s : &quot; What is the basic principle of the Ordinance?&quot;   And v have arrived at the conclusion that it is security for the native in respect of their land.  The Report of the East African Cotnnii sion in 1925 gave great prominence to this question.  It stated :- I In order to implement the White Paper of 1923, wl so definitely affirms British trusteeship for natives, it seenj necessary that a further instrument should be issued, laykf down the terms upon which the Crown holds native lands i Kenya, and the principles upon which the native estates shouj be managed on their behalf.&quot;1700. After dealing with some questions of detail, the BcpoJ proceeds : -&quot; We believe that, if this recognition of right and the! proposed safeguards were adopted in Kenya, a great deal the present misunderstanding and unrest would be allayed.&quot;!1701. It is clear from the context, which alludes to a meetiij with the Governor in Nairobi, that an Ordinance was already i contemplation, and we consider that the above passage correct! reflects the general objects for which it was to be enacted. Tj main objects are stated or implied, and both of them are concern with security. The first relates to the native lands as a whole, at requires that the terms on which the Crown holds them for natives should be defined, while the second relates to internal natiJ land or &quot;estates&quot;, and requires that the principles of managemel should be laid down.Tho Original 1702. We may conclude therefore that the original intention (Intention ot tne Ordinance was to create security for the natives, both in respet the Ordinance. ^ landg regarded as a wh0Ie, and in respect of privalrights under native law and custom. We may perhaps refer to the; two aspects as the tribal aspect and the private aspect.
530ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE ,,T III-Chapter VI]L703. The Native Lands Trust Ordinance, 1930, creates a trust The Tribal respect of certain lands reserved for the use and benefit of the -^T&quot;304-representative tribes of the Colony for ever. The lands are those which e described in Government Notice No. 394 of October, 1926, and ease of the word &quot;respectively&quot; in section 4 of the Ordinance is nerally understood to imply that there are separate trusts for each the several areas declared to be native reserves in the said dee. This, however, is a matter of inference rather than of direct iteraent, and is not completely satisfactory, because under the itice there are some tribes which have more than one reserve, nl some reserves which have more than one tribe. No provision is -ule for altering these boundaries except to the very limited extentaeltthe regulations about exclusion and addition allow.According to the grouping followed in the gazettement, The several &quot; * -      1    &apos;. . native reserves.1704..............ire are twenty-four units separately gazetted.1705. The first is called the North Kavirondo Native Reserve, jst of it is inhabited by the tribe known as the Bantu Kavirondo, : there are also other tribes, such as the Wakidi and the Elgohyi It a section of the Masai, who inhabit certain locations. It would irefore be inexact to call it a reserve for a tribe.1706. The next two reserves on the list are the-Central Kavi-tdo and the South Kavirondo. The chief tribe found in both se reserves is the Luo (Nilotic Kavirondo), who inhabit both es of the boundary between the two reserves, which therefore isi tribal boundary.  The Kisii are a large Bantu tribe inhabitingeastern locations of the South Kavirondo district, and the itende and other minor tribes are found in the southern areas. :se-reserves therefore cannot be called tribal in any strict sense.phrase employed in section 4 of the Ordinance -&quot; the tribeswhom they have, respectively, been reserved &quot; might be light to imply that the &quot;South Kavirondo Reserve&quot; was only for south Kavirondo, but it is obvious that it was not intended to aide the Kisii and other tribes which inhabit it, although they ie not been specified.1707. The next on the list is the Nandi Native Reserve, and next is called the Lumbwa (Belgut, Buret and Sotik) Native ive, being apparently one reserve shared by three units of the :e tribe.I170S. The sixth on the list is a comprehensive gazettement of Jnative reserves of the Kerio Province. Although they are all lided within one boundary, they are not called one reserve, but jStik, Kamasia, Marakwet, Elgeyo, and Njemps Native Reserves, jsutnably therefore each of them is devoted to the use and benefit
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part III Chapter VI]of the tribe concerned &quot;for ever&quot;, and the position of the bound-aries between them must be a matter of some moment. Yet it ha; not been specified.1709. The seventh on the list is the Masai Native Reserve, ant the eighth, ninth, and tenth are called the Kiambu, Fort Hall and Nyeri Native Reserves. It is interesting to note that none o these last three are specifically stated to be reserved to the Kikuyi tribe, which, except for the presence of a few Dorobo. inhabit them almost exclusively. The boundaries between these thie; reserves are in no sense tribal boundaries, ami the same tribi inhabits all these areas.1710. The Embu Native Reseiwe. which is the next on tin list, contains several tribes the Embu, Chuka, Emberre, am Atharaka.1711. The above enumeration will be sufficient to illustrate th-general character of the gazettement. and we need not pursue thi list to the end. But the twenty-first item perhaps deserves specia mention, since it shows seventeen separate areas gazetted uncle the comprehensive title, &quot; Native Beserves in Digo Administrativi District other than the Nyika Native Reserve.&quot;1712. The thought will readily suggest itself that, it&apos; a seriously attempt were to be made to enumerate the native tribes and statt exactly what areas had been reserved to the use and benefit of eacl &quot;for ever&quot;, no little confusion and disturbance would be caused. Fo these reasons, we have concluded that, provided that all the lam included in the gazettement remains native reserve, there is ni need to preserve the precise grouping, which does not represent i logical or a convenient, or even an intelligible, arrangement. Fo reasons already stated in sections 1442-1445 above, we have reeom mended very much larger units, and we have attempted (in sectiot 1446) a much more practicable description of the degree of exchisiv right which a tribe should be held to possess in the land which i occupies. Our objecf has been to avoid unnecessary restriction; to remove causes of petty jealousies,between tribes, and to permi of more freedom in the flow of population by means of peaceft interpenetration.1713. We may pause for a moment and consider the positio which would have been created in England if, after the land ha been consolidated into one kingdom, an ordinance had decreed tha each of the seven former kingdoms of the heptarchy was (o b set aside for the use and benefit of their respective inhabitants fo ever. Would such reservations have been for the benefit of Englisl men as a whole or even of the inhabitants of, say, Wessex or Nortl umbria, or would it have been to the advantage of the descendanl

The provisions in the trust concerning the alteration of Rigidity of (ibiil boundaries are exceedingly rigid.  There can be no exclusion p^MuLries land except for public purposes as enumerated in section 15 of Ordinance, and then only with the consent of the Board and :;t to a provision than an area equal in extent and as far as )!e equal in value must be added. Apart from this, there is no -ion for exchanges, and even additions can only take place the Governor considers that the land is &quot;required&quot; for the main-ice and support of the native tribes of the Colony, and if the nslative Council  assents.   No lease or licence can be granted ithout the consent of the Board.1715. The next point is the reservation of the land to the Tho Reserva-(ver.il tribes or tribal units &quot;for ever&quot;.   As we have already re- *^ ,&apos;, ked in more than one place, there is no reason to suppose that present groupings of tribes or even tribalism itself will last for1710. It is quite illusory to suppose that the inclusion of thetrds &quot;for ever&quot; in an Ordinance gives any legal sacrosanctity linst amendment.1717. We consider that our own proposal that the essential uses of the Ordinance should be safeguarded by Order in Council Jjvides a less pretentious but far more effective guarantee.1718. While the tribal aspect of the trust has been carried out The private so scrupulous a regard for security and permanence that it Aspect. Jcludes the possibility even of agreed exchanges, the private , namely, the security of native groups, families, or indi-Itials in the possession of their lands or &quot;estates&quot; has received [h scanty attention that it might almost be said to have been .-ted altogether.1716. In the Bill as originally drafted there was a clause en- xhe Ordinance ling the Governor to make rules defining the rights of groups, as Originally lilies, or individuals, but it was cut out after the Bill had been J)rafted-[established for criticism.  The explanation given by the Governor in letter to the Secretary of State in June, 1928, was that he was plied that it was better to deal with native customary tenure in the reserves by another Ordinance after a full investigation each area, which he proposed to institute as soon as the Land? (ist Bill was passed.1720. It is therefore clear that the legislation before us, namely, Incomplete Lands Trust Ordinance, is not the whole of the legislation ^^resent lich was projected.  Of the two principal ends in view, it deals Ordinance.
ProvisionregardingManagement,Development,Administra-tion andControl.ON THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part 111 Chapter VI]Icomprehensively with only one, which is probably the less impor tant. Doubts might be held of the wisdom of reserving areas land severally and rigidly to tribes &quot;for ever&quot;, when we I that tribes have frequently coalesced or split into sections an tribalism itself is already showing signs of disintegration. Btr there is nothing ephemeral about the need for guarding private rights, and we are sure that it will become more and more necessar as the natives advance in civilization.1721. After it had been decided to omit native private right; from the Ordinance, one would have supposed that its scope won be confined to the protection of the integrity of tribal land by stric regulation of the conditions under which any part of it could bi alienated either permanently by exclusion, or temporarily by leas or licence. The field would then have been left clear for question of internal management and control of native land to be coverei by the companion Ordinance which would deal with native private rights.1722. In attempting to make provision for internal manage merit, development, administration and control, while excludin; consideration of private rights in land, the Ordinance inevitabb creates the impression that the whole land is a common. For in stance, section 4 declares that all lands in native reserves are tine the management and control of the Central Doard, and shall administered for the use and benefit of the native tribes for whicfj they have been respectively reserved, a provision which apparent! gives the individual right-holder no voice in the matter. Again, ii section 6 it is laid down that the Central Board must consult th Local Board in all matters relating to management and develop ment of land in the native reserve, and since section 7 prevent anything being done except in accordance with the provisions the Ordinance, it would appear that a muramati could not managl his rjithaka nor a right-holder develop his land until the Centnj Board has consulted the Local Board about it.1723. In section 8 it is stated : &quot; All rents, stand premia, grazing fees or other profiJ whatsoever accruing from land in a native reserve, or froij timber or other forest produce, or from sand, lime, stone, other materials removed or taken from a native reserve, shall paid to the Local Native Fund, or. where there is no LocJ Native Fund, to the Natives&apos; Trust Fund, or may be paid any member or members of the tribe concerned wdio may 1 considered by the Central Board, after reference to the LocJ Board concerned, to be entitled thereto.&quot;Here the possibility that there might be private rights appealalmost as an afterthought.

But in the more thickly populated reserves private rights re the whole essence of the matter, and cannot be dismissed with a -sual reference, as a detailed examination of the section will show.1725. The section lays no obligation  on  the Local Native Pouts, onncil to determine whether the land leased is the property of nv group or family or to compensate it in respect of the value of ie land. And yet the evidence given to us both in Kikuyu and aviiondo shows that such a course is clearly desirable.1726. If the part of the section which deals with grazing land Grazing Fees, read as relating only to the hiring of grazing land by non-natives, is perhaps unobjectionable. But there is nothing to show that it hues only to such cases, and we have also to consider the practice ; obtaining between the natives themselves. While natives do ot charge each other grazing fees, they often make arrangements ith a poor relation to herd cattle for them, and make a paymentkind.   The recipient naturally does not pay it into the Local &quot;ative Fund.1727. As regards the provisions relating to all &quot;other profits iratsoever&quot;, the custom of pawning land, generally for goats, exists several districts, and the goats received would presumably come tier this head.  But nobody pays them to the Local Native Fund. -1728. To take the case of timber, many natives grow wattle Timber. 1 sell the bark outside the reserve.   They put the cash received io their pockets, and do not wait while the Central Board consults e Local Board as to what member or members of the tribe are titled thereto.1729. There are a few natives who dig sand and export it Sand, Lime,;n the reserve, and there have occasionally been instances of Stone, or. otherlives selling building stone or murrum, which they have dug materials, emselves, for use outside the reserves.   So tar as is known, no trney received on this account has reached the Local Native&quot;iltlfil.1730. We do not wish to press our criticism iu detail, hut the ait which we wish to make is this : The Ordinance was originally signed both to protect the integrity of tribal lands a whole and 3to protect the rights enjoyed by groups, families or individuals.subsequent decision to confine it to the first of these two jeets left the clauses relating to the internal management, de-ftnent, adminstration and control of land, so to speak, in the For although power is taken to manage and develop all hmd the native reserves, it is not suggested how it could be operated iliout subversion of existing customary rights.
ON THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part III Chapter VI]Requirements of Land Legislation for tho Native Reserves.General Criticism of the Ordinance.Criticism of the Ordinaacc in detail.Section I.1731. The Ordinance before us, on whose workings wc are required under our terms of reference to report, lacks its compleJ mentary half which was to deal with these blatters. That hall has never been drafted. We venture to say that it could not be drafted without a drastic revision of powers already granted under the existing Ordinance to the Lands Trust Board.1732. It is immaterial to our purpose whether there should be one Ordinance or several, provided that the essential requirements of land legislation for native reserves are met. Protection must be provided for the tribal lands as a whole, and also for private rbdits of groups, families and individuals under native law and custom. Nor is this all. It is not enough that the lands should be protected; they must also be developed. As is stated in the letter addressed to the Secretary of State by Sir 11. Mant. Sir G. Schuster and Mr. I. H. Oldhani, and appended to the Report of the Hilton-Youns Commission : &quot; It is not sufficient merely to reserve the land under ti dead hand of a rigid and unalienable legal restriction, and it a necessary consequence of these considerations that a measure! which aims at preserving the beneficial use of the land to the natives must include regulations for handling it.&quot;1733. The essential requirements being (a) protection of tribal lands, (6) protection of native private rights, and (c) development, it has to be confessed, if we are to judge of the Ordinance from the way in which it meets them, that, for a reason already given, it does not meet the second requirement at all, and that the failure to do so has prevented the provisions regarding internal management, control, and development being other than vague and nebulous. The point upon which the Ordinance has really concentrated is tin first requirement the protection of tribal lands. But even then we are unable to discern the principles upon which the particulai units of native reserve have been determined or the precise mean ing of the statement that they have been respectively reserved ti the various tribes. In face of the rapid changes which are takinj place, we consider as almost a contradiction in terms a provisioi which attempts to reserve specific lands to specific tribes &quot;for ever&apos; and we find that it is a serious defect in the Ordinance that nd machinery should have been provided for rectification of frontiers! or for agreed exchanges.1734. We now turn to criticism in detail, and shall pass rapidijj through the Ordinance clause by clause. At the conclusion of this process we shall offer our own proposals for reconstruction.Section 1 gives the short title.  We have no comment.
$&quot;33 ftON THE WORKING OE THE LANES TRUST ORDINANCE JpiKT III Chapter VI]Section 2 deals with the reservation of land for natives.   In Section 2. the first sentence it is stated that the areas of Crown land described [Government Notice No. 394 are native reserves set aside for theI;e and benefit of the native tribes of the Colony for ever. We jve already commented on the units selected, and have recom-lended wider units (see sections 1442-1446 above), and have recom-lended that the land cease to be Crown land (section 1649).1735. In connexion with the phrase &quot;use and benefit&quot;, refer-Jnce may be made to section 1446, in which we discuss the rights [occupant tribes and the extent to which there should be a right &apos; excluding members of other tribes.1736. We have commented on the phrase &quot;for ever&quot; in sections J15-1717, and also on the absence of adequate provision for rectifi-ition of frontiers (section 1723).1737. The demarcation of the boundaries on site in accordanceIitli the gazetted description has revealed many small discrep-ncies with the boundaries as till then observed. In several of liese cases, the position could have been set right to the satisfaction 1 parties by means of small exchanges, if a machinery had [eea provided.1738. In the second part of the section it is stated that the governor, with the approval of the Legislative Council, may &quot;re-:rve for the use and benefit of the native tribes of the Colony such ather areas of Crown land as in his opinion may be required for Jieir maintenance and support&quot;.1739. Several additions have been recommended by the Execu-Ive Council, but have not been brought before the Legislative luncil, because of the uncertainty regarding the meaning to be jtaehed to the word &quot;required&quot;. If it is to be interpreted to mean [necessary&quot; in the sense that the native tribes of the Colony could jo; otherwise be supported and maintained, it becomes impossible make any additions to meet some useful, but not absolutely isential, purpose.1740. In the second sentence of section 2 (2), it is stated that areas so reserved shall be deemed for the purposes of the Hi nance to be native reserve.    It would follow that it would (eiome reserved &quot;for ever&quot;.1741. Our own proposals are far less rigid. They would admit exchanges, additions, and, in certain circumstances, exclusions. Iditions now recommended to be made under Classes A and BI raid, it is contemplated, be made by the Governor with the Ivice and consent of the Legislative Council; additions now recom-ended to be made under Class B2 would be by lease at a low
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part HI Ciiapteh VI]rental, perhaps a peppercorn (sections 1456, 1457). Subsequent adJitions would normally be by lease at an economic rental, but it would also be possible for the Governor, with the approval of the Legislative Council, to add land as Class A or Bl without lease provided that additions in Class A should only be for the purpose of exchanges or petty adjustments (section 1473). The question of land given up by a native reserve in exchange for land added is covered in sections 1474 and 1475. The possibility of exclusion of land under Class Bl, if it should no longer be needed, is content-plated in section 1459, in which adequate safeguards are provided. Section 3. 1742. Section 3 deals with the constitution of the CentraBoard. Our criticisms have been made comprehensively in the las chapter (section 1693).At the end of this section is a provision that no lease or licence shall be granted and no land shall be excluded from ; native reserve for public purposes unless there shall be a meetiii! of the Lands Trust Board and at least five votes shall be records in favour of such lease, licence or exclusion. It has been pointei out that some licences are for very trivial purposes and that th Lands Trust Board ought not to be troubled with them at all. i case in point was an application to move one cart-load of lime fro a native reserve for testing purposes. We shall comment furihe ou these matters under the relevant sections below.Section 4. 1743. Section 4 provides that all lands in native reserves amall matters relating to such lands should be under the management and control of the Lands Trust Board.We are in complete disagreement with this section, both on th ground that it appears to overlook the existence of native private rights (see our comments in sections 1724-1731 above), and alsi because the control, administration and development of the nati reserves is a fundamental duty of Government, which it ought no] to delegate.1744. The existence of the trust implies that the Lands Trns Board should have a protective power, and we have endeavoure to provide for this by numerous safeguards (set out fully in Chat: ter III of this Bart). We have also proposed a general safeguar that, if the Board considers that the native reserves are not Lein. devoted to the use and benefit of the natives or that the land is n being conserved and properly developed, it should have the pow and duty of making representations to the Governor, or to tl Secretary of State. But, subject to these safeguards, the nianagi ment and control should remain with Government.
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE ptBT III Chapter VI]1745. Section 5 deals with the constitution of district advisory gection aims, called Local Boards. The working of the Local Boards calls ol- little criticism. They have fulfilled a useful function, and it is generally agreed that the European member has contributed use-ally to the debates. Nevertheless, in the reconstruction of the Inlinance which we shall presently recommend, we shall propose i:it the principal function of the Local Board will be to advise the Vovincial Commissioner, and also to record for the information of lovernment the extent of its agreement or disagreement with any proposal put before it by the Provincial Commissioner. The end in few is to obtain responsible native opinion, and the Provincial ominissioner will have at his command other sources of obtaining on-native opinion. We shall therefore recommend a purely native ,oc&quot;il Board, with the exception of the District Commissioner, who ould be chairman.174G. A point which cannot be neglected in these difficult times ;t!ic unnecessary&apos;expense entailed in meetings of the Local Board, he members are five : the Provincial Commissioner (chairman), se District Commissioner (vice-chairman), the Chief Native Com-lissioner (ex officio), one European unofficial, and one African. : is provided that &quot;the chairman or deputy chairman and three :her members shall form a quorum&quot;. Since there are only three her members besides the chairman and deputy chairman, it fol-nvs that they must all be present, and that no meeting of a Local iird can be held unless the Chief Native Commissioner attends, his curious provision has been ignored in practice or circumvented ithe doubtful expedient of co-option, and many meetings of Local onus have been held without his presence. But, even then, the rovincial Commissioner would have to be present, and that in self entails much travelling&quot;, especially under the new arrangementfewer and larger provinces. According to our proposal, the Local bards will be advisory to the Provincial Commissioner, and it is :tter that he should receive their reports in writing rather than bemember of the Board himself.1747. Section 6 provides that the Lands Trust Board shall Section insult the Local Board on certain matters specified.   In practice, iese matters do not reach the Lands Trust Board at all until the acal Board has reported on them.   This practice is far more avenicnt than the procedure laid down in the Ordinance.1746. The matters regarding which such consultation is de-required  to be necessary are :. (a) The granting of leases or licences nler section  ; (b) Exclusions for public purposes under section 15 al other powers exercised by the Governor under sections If) and(c) All matters relating to the management and development &apos; land in a native reserve.
1749. Regarding (a) and (6), we defer our comments until w( come to the sections concerned. Regarding (c), we dissent cum prehensivcly and profoundly.1750. The clause implies a static condition in which the initiative tion of development lies with the Lands Trust Board, which ask&apos; the advice of the Local Board, and finally authorizes somebody ti do something so that the reserve may be developed. We prefer ti think of a dynamic condition in which natives are themselves tin principal developing agents by cultivating their own crops on theii own land and pursuing their lawful occasions, the Lands Tins Board being only concerned in a protective capacity. Advice o regulation required for helping the natives to develop their owi land should be the active concern of Government. We agree, how ever, that the Lands Trust Board should make representations, &apos; it considers that Government is neglecting its duty in this respect.1751. In so far as it may be contended that the clause has m the meaning assigned to it, but is intended to apply only to applic; tions for leases or licences or the like, we remark that it is at one redundant to (a) and misleading.Section 7. 1752. Section 7 is entitled &quot;Disposal of land in Native Ihserves&quot;, and provides that no land may be &quot;leased or otberwi; disposed of&quot; except in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance The methods provided in the Ordinance are lease, licence, and, i certain cases, exclusion.1753. In practice, it has frequently been found convenient t deal with land required for purposes of social service or for trade h a different method, called &quot;setting apart&quot;, and described in rule under the Ordinance. These rules are made under section 22, wliic admits of rules being made &quot;for the purpose of carrying this Ordir ance into effect&quot;. But we confess to a doubt whether rules wliic seem to involve a departure from the Ordinance can properly b called an implementing of it.1754. However, we fully agree that there ought to be a metho of setting apart, and have recommended (section 1539) that it b given a wider application than is contemplated in the rules. 13:: we consider that the provisions should be embodied in the Ordinanc itself.1755. In the second clause of the section it is stated that n lease or licence shall be granted until the Lands Trust Board ha consulted the Local Board and is,satisfied that the proposal ha been brought to the notice of the local natives concerned and o the Local Native Council. It is further provided that if the AfricaiON THE WORKING OE THE LAN OS TRUST ORDINANCE Pakt III Chapter VI]
ON THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRTJST ORDINANCE III-Chapter VI]534ember of the Local Board or the Local Native Council objects, lease or licence shall not be issued without the sanction of the etary of State.1756. These provisions appear to us to entail an excess of ence to authority. Taking first the case of leases, we consider our recommendations at sections 1526, 1541 and 1631 give all safeguards which are necessary, entailing as they do (a) an ori-I setting apart, duly safeguarded; (6) discretion to the Pro-ial  Commissioner, after consultation  with the Local Land id, to grant a lease of a plot up to ten acres in an area so set t; (c) discretion to the Chief Native Commissioner to assent, behalf of the Lands Trust Board, to the leasing of land up to acres in an area so set apart: (d) direct reference to the Lands -t Board and a power of veto by the Board in cases where the to be leased exceeds fifty acres. In our opinion, that gives all safeguards which are necessary, provided that, as we shall commend, the Local Board is reconstituted to consist almost rely of natives, and the Lands Trust Board is a body com-oly independent of Government.1757. Our second criticism of the provisions regarding leases that they sometimes involve unnecessary delay. For instance, en once a piece of land has been set apart for a trading centre,the Local Board, the Local Native Council, and the local tives have all been consulted, and the Lands Trust Board has eed, it is a wearisome procedure to have to repeat the whole aeess of consultation over again each time that an individual plot (he trading centre has to be leased..175S. We have already commented (section 1534 above) on the jvision in section 7 (b), that there may be no lease unless there reason to believe that the natives of the tribe will derive benefit art from, revenue. We regard this as unnecessary, but agree thatlease should not be granted unless there is reason to believe that will be of benefit to the natives when all the circumstances,, hiding the rent, have been taken into account.1.759. We have also commented (section 1535) on the provision atained in section 7 (c), which forbids lease if the land is being eficially occupied, or is likely to be required for the use and iport of the natives of the tribe during the currency of the lease, aring in mind that plots for public purposes or for purposes of al service, such as schools and churches, are most likely to be jaired where the population is thickest, we cannot subscribe to s provision, but we agree that there must be full compensation, ren when the purpose is for an industrial lease, we cannot entirely jo that occupation, however sparse, should preclude the issue of
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part HI-Chapter VI]the lease, however important the object may be and however bene-ficial to the natives it may be. We consider that, subject to con-sent of the Lands Trust Board and the agreement of the Governor it should be possible to grant leases in such cases, provided that the compensation paid is full and generous and that every reasonable precaution is observed.1760. Section 8 deals with &quot;Alienation or other disposal ot land in Native Reserves&quot;.1761. Section 8 (1) (a) provides that the Governor may issue leases with the advice and consent of the Lands Trust Board, but that the Lands Trust Board should fix the rent. We have recom-mended (section 1531) that the Provincial Commissioner should decide the matter after consulting the Local Board, but that there be an appeal to the Governor, and that the Lands Trust Board! should have a power of veto in the case of all leases of land in excess of ten acres. The present provision involves too much reference o! petty matters to the Lands Trust Board.1762. Section 8 (1) (b) deals with the issue of licences to &quot;persons not being members of the tribe&quot; in respect of (1) the grazing of cattle; (2) the removal of timber or other forest produce: and (3) the taking of sand, lime, stone, etc. It provides that the Governor may issue them with the advice and consent of the Lands Trust Board. But it is provided in section 3 that no such licence! may be issued unless at least five members of the Lands Trust Board are in favour of them, while section 7 requires that there must be a reference to the Secretary of State, if the Local Native Council or the African member of the Local Land Board objects, j1763. We consider the whole process to be far too cumbersome]! We have already made our criticisms (sections 1623-1620). and havel endeavoured to make recommendations which will provide an ade-nuate safeguard for native interests, while allowing a much widet discretion to the local authorities. Constant reference of pettj matters to the Lands Trust Board has the triple disadvantage that il distracts the attention of the Board from more serious duties, hold: up legitimate development, and introduces a creeping paralysis into the power and ultimately the will of the Government tc govern.1761. Section 8 (1) of the Ordinance contains a special clause! relating to the Masai tribe. For reasons already stated in section o71, we think that the considerations governing the question ofl leases or licensed&quot;es in the Masai Native Reserve should be the sameS -as they are in any other native reserve, and we see no need for thfl retention of the special clauses.
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE ,jBT 111-Chapter VI]5351765. Section 8 (2) relates to leases for special purposes.  We uve no comments other than those which we have already made leases generally.1766. Section 8 (3) deals with the destination of all rents, luiid premia, grazing fees and &quot;other profits whatsoever&quot;. We uve already given our opinion that it takes insufficient account of lie existence of private rights. We have also pointed out (section the difficulty caused by the requirement that all profits from lie sale of forest pi-oduce in a native reserve forest reserve have be paid to the Local Native Council.1767. Section 8 (4) provides that a yearly return of all leases ad licences should be forwarded to the Lands Trust Board.   We dint consider this to be necessary, and have given our reasons in -actions 1624-1629 above. 1768. Section 9 deals with the forms of leases and conditions Section &amp;. plied in leases. We only wish to comment on one point. .1769. In section 9 (2) (6), it is provided that the lessee shall 1 himself to pay such compensation for damage or disturbance sthe Lands Trust Board may assess. According to our recommen-ations there would be no such obligation.  The Local Native Coun-1 would arrange to compensate the right-holders when the plot is ;aside, and the lessee would get a straight lease (section 1528). ay other arrangement would be cumbersome, because right-holders eraiently prefer annual rather than outright compensation, and, if e lessee were to pay it, he would have the appearance of paying o rents one to the right-holder and one to. the Local Native juncil.  And, if there should be more than one right-holder, the triplication would be worse. Another point is that, in our recom-endation, the Provincial Commissioner assesses the compensation rect to safeguards enumerated in sections 1526 and 1541, which elude a power of veto by the Lands Trust Board if the land to be t apart exceeds ten acres.1770. Section 10 provides that the rent charged in all leases Section 10. nst be fixed &quot;at the highest amount that can reasonably be ex--ted to be obtained from the land, having regard, etc. . . .&quot;1771. We have already stated in section 1533 above that we Bird this provision as unduly rigid, and that more latitude should allowed.1772. It is worth remarking that the Governor of Kenya, in :roducing the Bill in the Legislative Council, stated of the lease-1 clauses : &quot; The first object of these clauses has nothing to do with alienation from the tribe concerned. It is to provide that in-dividual leasehold tenure may be introduced for the benefit of
ON THE WORKING OP THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part III-Ouafteb VI]members of the tribe to which the reserve as a whole secured.&apos;&apos;It seems somewhat strange, if such was the primary object of the: clauses, that the Ordinance should have gone out of its way I demand a maximum rent.Section 11. 1773. Section 11 provides that lessees may not alienate lacby sub-lease or otherwise without the consent of the Lands Tin Board. We have no comment on the fairness of this proposal, hu pursuing our general design of relieving the Lands Trust Board i non-essential duties, we recommend that reference to it should ni be necessary if the land to be sub-leased or otherwise alienated less than fifty acres in extent, unless there is to be a change i user; but that the Provincial Commissioner should deal with sue matters after consulting the Local Land Board, and subject to a appeal to the Governor. Even if there is to be a change of use we do not think it necessary that reference should be made to tl Lands Trust Board if the land affected by the change of user less than ten acres in extent.frlnd if&apos; 1774- Sections 12 and 13 provide for forfeiture of lease ilicence for non-payment of rent or breach of covenant. Section 1 provides that such forfeiture does not extinguish the debt. \\ have no comments.Section lo. 1775. Section 15 (1) gives power to the Governor to excltuland from a native reserve for certain public purposes, but on subject to the advice and consent of the Lands Trust Board. Whi we have given reasons for thinking that exclusion is generally a the best way of securing land for public purposes, and that settir apart is better, w7e have recommended that exclusion should remarkable a possibility (section 1517). But in case it should happen that tl Lands Trust Board refuses its consent, and that no satisfactoi arrangement can be made either by the process of setting apart i exclusion, we have recommended that it should be possible, wil the consent of the Secretary of State, for land to be acquired undi the Land Acquisition Act or similar provisions (section 1521), at we have advised that in our opinion such a provision would not 1 unfair to natives, as all land in the country is subject to simil; provisions.1776. There has been much criticism on the score of impra practicability of the clause that, when any land is excised, an an equal in extent and as far as possible equal in value must he adde We agree that the provision would be impracticable in many case but consider that it should be allowed to stand, subject to tl modification that, in the last resort, if no satisfactory arrangemei
ON THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRUST 0RDINANCE si III-Chapter VI]to.-lio reached either by this process or by setting apart,-the pro-jons of the Land Acquisition Act can be applied, in which case upensation need not necessarily be in land.1777. While section 15 only provides for excision for public oses, we consider that there should also be provision for ex-is to balance additions in voluntary exchanges, but we consider alence to be a more important consideration than exact equality va in such cases.1778. If our views in regard to the constitution of the Lands t Board are accepted, we consider that the provision niado at :nd of section 15 (1) should be omitted, since the safeguard of jrence to the Secretary of State in cases where 200 acres or re are involved, should no longer be required (see section 1510 ire).     -    - &apos;1779. We consider that the proviso to section 15 (2) should be lied, because we cannot conceive that it should ever be neces-v to exclude roads or railways or the sites of single buildings ii the native reserve, and we have made proposals dealing with n bv&apos; means of setting apart. For our proposals, see sections 17-1617.1780. Section 16 provides that the Governor may (a) take stone Section ither materials from any land in a native reserve for repairing Is or for other public works upon payment of compensation for or disturbance ; (6) conduct electric lines, water pipes, sewers,. without paying compensation, but making good all damages;do any work in connexion with specified classes of waterworks:i compensation for loss or disturbance; (d) grant written auth-i to Government officers and contractors and their servants or its to do these things. &apos;   1 -1781. The clause seems satisfactory enough until one discoversfact of which the section itself gives no hint that it is governedsection 6, which provides that the Lands Trust Board mustalt the Local Board about &quot;matters relating to and arising outic exercise of the powers of the Governor&quot; under this section.1782. Thus it happens that, if a District Commissioner, havingGovernors permission in writing, authorizes a contractor toI in the reserve a native tribunal court, for which the Docalive Council has voted funds, and for that purpose to take stoneii the neighbourhood ; or if he instructs the station hands to dig rum, sand or clay for the repair of the police lines, or if he fills in a hole in a road in the reserve-and moves any material any land-^-these are matters upon which the Lands Trust frcl must consult the Local Board.      - -
ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Part III Chapter VI]1783. We consider that the actions of the Governoror toauthorized agents under this section should not be liable called in question by the Lands Trust Board or by the Local B except in so far as the Provincial Commissioner may refer to Local Board any question of compensation which may arise.Section 17. 1784. Section 17 provides that nothing may be done byGovernor or be allowed by him to be done under sections 15 an which would have the effect of depriving the natives concerned any water without the prior consent of the Lands Trust Board, comments have already been made in sections 1595-1G06 above.Section 18. 1785. Section 18 provides that no forest area in a native resetmay be declared without the consent of the Lands Trust Board that no rules may be made concerning such forest area, w. declared, without consent of the Board.   We have recorded general agreement with the first part of this proviso, and oui agreement with the second part, in section 1018 above.Section 19. 1786. Section 19 provides that the Chief Native commission is the responsible officer for representing the Crown or the Govern in all actions instituted under the Ordinance.   We have no ments.Section 20. 1787. Section 20 deals with the power of officials to enter u\lands in the execution of their duty.  We have no comments.Section 21. 1788. Section 21 prescribes the penalty for unlawful occution of land in a native reserve. We consider that, in order to av the necessity of reference to other Ordinances, the position sho be made clear as to what constitutes unlawful occupation, this connexion, we invite attention to sections 1667 and 166S aboSections 22, 1789. Section 22 provides a power to make rules; section23, and 24.      saves existing rights held upon title : and section 24 repeals Partof the Crown Lands Ordinance.

In the final chapter of our Report we shall offer sug tions as to the particular matters for which the protection of Order in Council should be sought, but we shall content ours
537ON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE nui 1 LI Chapter VI](his place with reiterating the salient features of our recoin-mndatious.1792. The land reserved for tribal tenure should be :  Class A Reserves, to be known as Native Lands. Class Bl Reserves.Class B2 Reserves. *These categories have been defined in section 1433. The par-Kjlar areas included in each category are described in the schedules (lowing section 1510, and are shown in the coloured map following Uion 2152.1793; We recommend that Class A be native land, and not tiiuii land, and that the boundaries of the nine main units which eliave recommended be denned and protected by Order in Council.1794. Class Bl should be called Native Reserve, but remain iinni laud.  It should be under the protection of the Lands Trust Had.   It should not be diminished or taken away without the iiisont of the Board, excepting only that an appeal should lie to Secretary of Stale, who should be able, if he considers that -iient cause exists, to override the veto of the Board.  Class B2 toild be held on lease. In respect of areas now recommended to Class B2, we advise a very low rental, perhaps a peppercorn, lit strict conditions of conservation and use.  In respect of further as which may possibly be required as B2 in the future we recom-ditl an economic rental. The protection of the Lands Trust Board iiald be extended to Class B2 in the same way as Bl, and should subject to the same appeal to the Secretary of State. 1795. Adjustments of tribal subdivisions occurring within the midaries of the main units should be matters for decision by the Ternoi-; and it is not advisable that the protection of  the tor in Council or of the Lands Trust Board should be extended hem. This would, of course, not affect private rights in land.1790. Grouping of tribes within a single unit of native lands Dtild be held to imply that the system or systems of land tenure tuning among them are the same or similar, and can be de-oped along similar lines, subject to such local variations as are ad to bo required. Neither the units themselves nor the separate ups within tlie units must be held to constitute an impenetrable Tier against immigration of members of other tribes or groups, live recommend that the following provision should be inserted the Ordinance to define and safeguard private rights, whether of groups, families or individuals : In respect of the occupation, use, management, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of any land situated in(1) The Land to bo reserved&apos; for Tribal Tenure.(2) Status el&apos; the Land go reserved.(til Security for Tribal Sub-Units.(4) Rights Occupant Tribes and -PrivateRights.;.-.

(5) Additions.&apos; 1797, Our recommendations regarding the extent  to windadditions should be allowable, and the method for making therhi have been- clearly&apos; set out in sections 1473 and 1741.

We have agreed that the method of exclusion and com pensatory addition, as described in section 15 of the Ordinance] should remain as a way, but not as the only way, of acquiring Ian for public purposes. We have proposed certain amendments t details (sec sections 1607-1617; also 1778 and 1779).... .1799- Our proposals in regard to setting apart have been t-oni prehensively stated (sections 1523-1541). and it would be wearisom to repeat.them here.

We have recommended that an objection by.the Board linst a licence already issued should be valid to prevent renewal, tept that it may be necessary to provide for appeal to the jrctary of State against the veto of the Lands Trust Board in liters vitally affecting essential supplies (section 1628 and note).1803. Our recommendations in regard to the special cases, of speeding licences, special alluvial permits, etc., are given in tions 1582-1594, and in regard to water permits in sections 0-1 GOG.,1804. We recommend : (a) that the Provincial Commissioner sild be able to do and to authorize.others to do all the things sifted in section 16 of the Ordinance in respect of taking stone or :er material required for public works, conducting electric.lines, ler-pipe lines, etc., undertaking works for the conservation of w or improving the flow of any river and works of it like nature, vuled that, he should observe the requirements of the Water ance and any other relevant Ordinance; (b) that he should be e to delegate his powers to District Commissioners in respect of !section; (c) that he should assess any compensation due, after saltation with the Local Board ; id) that in the event of a dis-iement between the Provincial Commissioner and the Local ird regarding the amount of compensation due, the Chief Native miissioner should decide; (e) that the Lands Trust Board should be concerned, except that it should have the right to be supplied any information for which it may ask, and to make representa-to the Governor and to the Secretary of State.1805. We recommend that the provisions of section 8 (3) re-ling the destination to the Local Native Council of all rents, il premia, etc., should remain, in so far as their general inten-is concerned, but that they be amended in detail so as to ate the difficulties to which we have invited attention..1806. We have also recommended (section 1546) the introduc-of provisions which would compel disbursements or recoveries e made from rents for the fulfilment of certain obligations:  . ;1807.

While we have no comment on the general provision i section 22 of the Ordinance that the Governor, with the advit and consent of the Lands Trust Board, may make rules for tl purpose of carrying the Ordinance into effect, we have recon mended a somewhat different procedure in regard to rules made fi the regulation of matters affecting land tenure as between natii and native in the reserve. There wre have recommended that, alt full discussion and debate, the method of which for the sake security should lie laid down in the Ordinance, the Governor shott have the power to make the rules, subject to notification to t! Lands Trust Board and a power of disallowance by the Secretary State.1809./The reason for the distinction is that the regulation of system of land tenure by a development of native custom calls f close study and expert knowledge, and we consider that the advi and consent of the Lands Trust Board in such a matter would be less sure guide to right action than the advice and consent of tl various other bodies for whose consultation we have provided.1810. We have recommended that the Brovincial Commission should be the officer directly responsible for the operation of tl Ordinance in his province.1811. In view of our recommendation that Class A land shouH be native land, it is probable that section 20 of the OrdinanrJH dealing with the rights of officers to enter upon any land in tl performance of their duties, will have to be amplified and extendeffl The power of the Government to carry out its duties must J] completely safeguarded.1812. The duties of the Lands Trust Board should consist] the exercise of a protective control in accordance with the terj of the trust, as safeguarded and defined by Order in Council, in conformity with the Ordinance.1813. The duties of the Local Board should be : (1) To adv the Brovincial Commissioner in matters relating to land bothI respect of the protective need and to some extent the construct) need; (2) To act as a check on the Brovincial Commissioner means of objections, which would entail reference to higher august ority.  We recommend that the members should consist of (a) District Commissioner, (b) two of the nominated members of Local Native Council to be chosen by the Brovincial Commission? (c) two of the elected members of the Local Native Council, one. be chosen by the Provincial Commissioner and one to be electedj the Local Native Council.
5391814. It is a matter for consideration whether the provisions for (IS) Native ,tive Lands, Class C should he under the Crown Lands Ordin- Jjands. Claas M or the Lands Trust Ordinance.   We have recommended, in tion 1469, that their external boundaries should be protected by ler in Council, but should be capable of modification by means exchanges, subject to the consent of the Lands Trust Board ini case.1815. We. have now summarized what we consider to be the The proposals [ding requirements for an equitable and workable Lands Trust &quot;^jf&quot;&quot;^ Hinance.   We should wish our proposals to be judged by the existing Uvers which they provide to the following questions :-  Ordinance.(1) Do they give the natives more security that the existing Ordinance?(2) Do they afford a better method for management, develop-ment and control?1816. To ensure security, we have recommended that an Order (1) Th9 j Council be sought to ensure the proposed Ordinance against p^j^y ot lendment of essential chaises without the authorization of a sub-tiucnt Order in Council.   This gives far better security than an iinance which purports to reserve the native lands &quot;for the use benefit of the native tribes of the Colony for ever&quot;, but which litself. not safeguarded against amendment.We consider that when this has been done it will no longer necessary to provide that the Ordinance should be an overriding ilinance. If the essential clauses are safeguarded by an Order in iiincil, there is no reason why the subsidiary clauses should not as freely amended as those in any other Ordinance, and if theypen to conflict with the provisions of some other Ordinance, -re is no reason why they should always prevail.1817. We have proposed that all the land which is now native dve and all the additional land which we consider that the lives can claim &quot;as of right&quot; on historical grounds, should cease be Crown land and should be native land under the protection the Lands Trust Board on terms secured by Order in Council, e have also recommended that lands required for economic needs fch seem likely to be permanent should be added to the native erves under protection of the Lands Trust Board, but should main Crown land.&apos; Such lands could not be taken away or uiinished without the consent of the Lands Trust Board, except it there would be an appeal to the Secretary of State, who would able, if he considers that sufficient cause exists, to override the to of the Board. There are also cases of economic needs which less likely- to be permanent, and in these cases we have (commended lease on a low rental, perhaps a peppercorn, but withON THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE l,r HI-Chapter VI]
ON&apos;THE WORKING OF THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE1&apos;aht III-ClUVTBR VI]strict conditions of conservation and use. To meet further tribs heeds which may arise in future, we have recommended lease , the normal method, but have provided means by which, if nice sary, exchanges or petty adjustments could be made on a mot permanent basis (sections 1473-1475).1818. These arrangements give far more security to native, against shortage of land than the provisions of the present Ordir ance. The proviso of the present Ordinance that land, once addei is added for ever must inevitably invite strong opposition to over extension, and none can he made without the approval of tl Legislative Council.181.&apos;.). A second point is that it has been argued, under tli existing Ordinance, that no land can be added to a reserve, mile-the tribe concerned could not otherwise be maintained and sri[ ported. Whether or not this is the real meaning of section 2 -of the. Ordinance, no addition has in fact been made to any native reserve since the Ordinance was passed. Several additions hav been approved by Executive. Council, but have not been placed bt fore Legislative Council on account of this difficulty. Our proposal contain no such disability.1820. As a practical step to preserve the integrity of tribe ; territory and to foster the growth of a tribal pride in its develoj ment, we have proposed that land required for townships or otlr public purposes, instead of being excluded as the present Ordinanc provides, should remain in the reserve concerned, and be develop; as par!&quot; of it;1821. We consider it a just criticism of tlie original Ordinanc that it is too much obsessed with the idea of land as a son common reserved for a tribe.   Our proposals throughout will found to give far more prominence to private right-holding, a they are based on a frank recognition of the fact that the tciui of land is progressively becoming more individual, and that ill problem of land for natives certainly cannot be met simply by t: expedient of reserving areas to specific &quot;tribes of the Colony ftj ever&quot;.1822. In all these ways we claim to have come to closer gri[ with the practical piroblem of providing land for natives and di veloping it for their use and benefit. We believe that our proposal taken as a whole, offer them far more security in these respeel than does the present Lands Trust Ordinance.1823. Our recommendations in respect of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; area: of which more details will be given below, are outside the scope ( the present chapter, but must be taken into account, when ill
540ilities which natives would enjoy under the terms of our Report i compared with those which they now&apos;have under the Lands nst Ordinance.1824. The statement is not open to serious challenge that the QucTt&apos;j*n of isions of the existing Ordinance, iii which all management,   Development, adopment, administration and control of native land is placed --die hands of the Central Board, are utterly unworkable, ami have :;; &apos;&apos;.n generally ignored. The Provincial Administration has, very iperly, continued to regard itself as responsible for the tutelage the natives in respect of the development of their reserves. We iieve that our proposals, if implemented, will strengthen the. iid of Government and enable it. to face with more confidence - urgent task with which it is confronted, both in developing oufces and also in conserving the soil against deterioration.1825. Our whole endeavour has been to provide for an Ordin-:e which will work, instead of one which, in the opinion of most inistrative officers, is so lost in the tangle of its own checks counterchecks as to constitute a serious hindrance to progress ie reserves. If the Land Board is required to deal with all ts of petty details, we cannot expect men of distinction to con-it to serve on it. We consider that we shall have the support of races and.sections in Kenya in recommending the creation of a wig independent Board to deal with essential safeguards, and &apos; liberation of Government from the irksome petty restrictions ich, under the existing Ordinance, have to a large extent alysed its power of action.nu (1t!iON THE WORKING OE THE LANDS TRUST ORDINANCE Iibt III-Chapter VI]
CHAPTER VII.Existing Claims of Right.The Basis of the- Claims.Tribal Claims.Private Claims.EXISTING NATIVE RIGHTS OR CLAIMS OUTSIDE NATIVE RESERVES.1826. Before proceeding to the consideration of what facilitieJj ought to he given to natives in respect of the nse and occupation ofl land outside the reserves, we shall devote a chapter to the considera tion of the steps to he taken in regard to rights which already exis or are claimed.1827. With insignificant exceptions, there is no land in tin Colony (as apart from the Protectorate) which has been issued ti natives on any form of private title more durable than a temporal&apos;] occupation licence. No difficulties arise in this connexion whici need be considered here. The difficulty is of another kind, am arises from the fact that certain rights are claimed as either pre existing the Government land legislation and independently valid or as being specially saved under that legislation. These claim have both a tribal and a private aspect.1828. In the tribal aspect they are claims that the tribe question was formerly in occupation of territory of which, it 1 been deprived. We have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into thes claims, and the results of our investigations have been stated in tli first two parts of our Report. The arrangements which we hav proposed for the settlement of this question should be held t constitute a full quittance of all tribal claims of right external t the boundaries of the tribal territory as they will become as a resul of the additions recommended.1S29. The question arises whether these settlements with th tribes should be held to carry with them automatically a settlemer with all the individual members of the tribes.  For instance, if piece of tribal territory has been lost and a compensating area ha been added, are we to hold that the individuals who occupied th area lost are sufficiently compensated and can justly be required t accommodate themselves in the reserve or in the added area? Th question arises as a clear issue in respect of section 86 (1) of th Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915, in which it is provided that:-&quot; The Governor may grant leases of areas of land co taining native villages or settlements without specially exclu ing such villages or settlements, but land in the actual occupation tion of natives at the date of the lease shall, so long as it actually occupied by them, be deemed to be excluded fro the lease.&quot;
&quot;oN NATIVE RIGHTS OR CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE RESERVES ,r III-Chapter VII]541L830. The same provision, in almost identical terms, is con-ined in section 31 (1) of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1902. It therefore very pertinent to ask whether, an equitable settlement iving been reached with the tribes regarding their territory as a io!e, these particular rights may now be extinguished.1.831. It is not only in respect of the leasehold lands that this lost ion arises, for it is provided in section 30 of the Crown Lands liinance, 1902. that : &quot; The Commissioner shall not sell or lease any land- in the actual occupation of natives.&quot;;we have had occasion to point out in more than one instance,Is clause has sometimes been disregarded in the disposal of free-id. In our opinion, the private claims of any natives affected by -h action are in equity quite as worthy of consideration as the ms which are protected under the leasehold clauses. The whole tie must be considered as one, and may be stated thus : &quot; An equitable settlement having been reached with the tribes, is it desirable or is it fair that all native private rights existing outside the reserves should now be extinguished? &quot;1832. With certain reservations and exceptions which will have I be explained later, it is manifestly- undesirable that native rights side the reserves should continue on their present basis. The crds to which we have had access show that the Law Officers the Crown have differed as to the meaning of &quot;native villages or tlements&quot; or &quot;actual occupation of natives&quot;, and the legal evidence-ce which we have taken upion the point would appear to indicate it a state of uncertainty exists which must be extremely pre-licial to that security of land-holding and development which it ist be one of the first duties of any Government to create. It is mdantly clear, that these natives rights must either be defined, be compensated and extinguished.   The first alternative is openJthe objection that it would create a large number of native dements scattered about at a distance from each other and from reserves, and we believe that all responsible opinion in theIiony, both native and non-native, would be united in preferring olution on the lines of consolidation: that is to say, an extension the reserves in return for a surrender of rights outside them. 1S33. Such consolidation we have endeavoured to bring aboutIour proposals for various extensions of the native reserve bound-is. The question is whether, in consideration of them, native his outside the reserves should now be extinguished without re ado, or whether some special compensation for disturbance ist be paid over and above the block additions of land to the concerned.The desirability of excinguish-ing Native Rights in Land outside the Reserves except such Rights as are held upon Title.
ON.&apos; NATIVE RIGHTS OR CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE RESERVES Part 111-Chapter Vll]The Fairness, - . 1834. The fairness of the proposal to extinguish depends u Prep msil the adequacy of the compensation in each case, and it will he rito review the matter as it affects each tribe.The Kikuyu. 1835. In the case of the Kikuyu we found that some of tlinatives who were on the farms when they were alienated ft compensation and left; others left subsequently without compi sation; and yet others still remain.   We decided first that a I settlement should be made with the tribe by the addition of la equivalent to the net loss, but that over and above this, a funlit addition of territory should be made as a sort of general com pens tion for disturbance, but that it wotdd not be practicable or desi able to seek for the actual persons disturbed and compensate Una severally-, excepting only those who still remain on the farms, their case, we recommended the payment of a sum of  2,000 to distributed among them.1836. Special features exist among the Kikuyu which have counterpart among most of the other tribes. Partly because of tli density in which&apos;their land is now inhabited, and partly because? of peculiarities in their system of land tenure, more actual loss an inconvenience is likely to be caused in their case if a man is rc ; : &apos; :i: quired to move his huts and go and live and cultivate elsewh &apos;r For this reason we have recommended a cash compensation, whict...   .&apos;.  &apos;-      we shall not find to be necessary in the case of those tribes wliii :      have a- less individualized form of land tenure.Tne Masai. 1837. The tribal settlement with the Masai was secured Itagreement, and must be held to have covered all rights both publi e     and private.   The only point of doubt which exists in our mind is whether a few farms on the Mbagathi River, which have bee: alienated by an oversight, lie partly in the Masai Native Reser or in that part of it which might be held to be subject to certain private or group rights of the late Laibon Lenana&apos;s successors otlice.   We have recommended (section 692) that the Local Natr Council should receive the amount which was actually paid Government for the purchase of the land, and that the question whether the Laibon is entitled to a share in it should then I investigated.   All rights of the Masai on these farms, both public and private, should then be extinguished.The Katnba. 1838. In the case of the Kamba. we are fully satisfied titthe settlement which we have proposed is an equitable settleniei of all rights, both public and private. By the recommendatic-r made at sections 759 and 767 above the tribe will gain a vet large addition of territory. Any natives disturbed by reason the proposed Kikumbuliu exchange will be amply compensated i the greater extent and better quality of the land in the area whi the tribe would receive in exchange and to which they&apos;could

The tribes of tlie Northern Frontier mce are nomadic in character and private tenure of land does not k^ntier t in any recognizable form.   Wlien we recommend, in general ^&quot;r&apos; Tai-kana ;s, that no private rights of natives to any land outside the Plovinc08, vo reserves should be deemed to exist except such as may be , on private title, we are making a recommendation which jably does not affect them in any sensible degree.  Nevertheless, ivili probably be better to consider the Northern Frontier and ma Provinces as excluded from the scope of the recomnienda-In so far as private rights to land may be conceived to exist mg them, they should not be debarred from consideration within Mieral limits of the land occupied by the tribe.  Outside those is, no member of the tribe should be deemed to have private its, unless he secured them on some form of title.1810. For the tribes of. the Rift Valley Province, the Suk, the The Tribes of nuns and the Kamasia, we have made proposals which will result the Rift extensive additions to the native reserve.   The settlement with pj&quot;&apos;^^ tribe should be held to comprise a settlement with all its mem-und no private rights of natives of these tribes outside the mils of the native reserve should be held to exist. We are satisfied at no hardship will result from this recommendation.1S41. Certain families of Kamasia and Dorobo have rights of The Grogau izingvin parts of the area known as the Grogan Concession, and Concession, y recommendations which we may make for a general expunging private rights outside the reserves,&apos; except such as may exist or created on title, should not be held to affect these rights of izing.1812. The Elgeyo made certain claims to have exercised rights grazing on the Grogan Concession, but the contention was not instantiated. We have recommended an addition to this reserve lioimting, on balance, to 161- square miles (section 1027), and wTe usider that any question of private rights may be held to be aged in this settlement with these tribes.1843. The case of the Nandi resembles that of the Lumbwa, The Nandi t natives disturbed from the Kipkarren farms actually received npensation at the rate of Rs. 50 a hut. On the Kaimosi farms ere were, so far as we are able to ascertain, practically no natives the time of alienation. The Kaimosi and Kipkarren farms main theoretically in the reserve, though alienated on 999 years&apos; , . lse, and the Native Council gets the rents. At sections 1065 and we have made recommendations which offer a full recompenseThe Elgeyo, Ch&quot;rangani and Marakwet.
ON NATIVE RIGHTS Oil CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE RESERVES Paiit ill Chapter Vll]to the tribe for the true loss sustained by reason of the alienation. We have, done our best to reach a settlement fair to all partie-and we consider that it would not be right or equitable at this dai to consider individuals as apart from the tribe.The Elgonyi. 1844. We have made recommendations at section 1087 ahuvlthat the Elgonyi be moved from the Trans Nzoia farm area, con pensation being paid to any of them who have been in resident for more than three years. After the compensation has been pai and the move has taken place, any private lights which they ina have could equitably be extinguished.The Lumbwa. 1845. We shall next consider the Lumbwa.  At the time of tlialienations they were a semi-nomadic tribe, who used to move the dwellings freely and frequently&apos; as they sought for better pasture No perceptible difficulty arose about the tenure of land, and tl loss occasioned by disturbance was nothing but the labour of buili ing a new hut, and conceivably a loss of amenities, although vvhe the group moved as a whole in accordance with its own nomad custom it is not easy to perceive what amenities were lost. Tl loss occasioned by the alienations was almost exclusively triba since it caused a restriction of the area over which the comnu, right of grazing could be exercised, and it is difficult to say tli, any one native sulfered from it more than another.We do not wish to contend that, if some fresh alteration i boundaries were to take place to-day, it would not be right to con compensate the individuals affected.  It would obviously be just to i so, but in seeking a settlement of difficulties arising from alienatioi which took place many years ago, there is such a thing as being t( meticulous, and we believe that at this date, if we were to *Jl out a few special cases of Lumbwa who were personally affecteH and make a distinction between them and other natives who nufl have gone later on to the farms as squatters, the action would iifl be appreciated by the tribe and the distinction would be accoimtflj as invidious.1848. We have therefore concluded that the general settleimiB which we have proposed, by which the tribe gets land in ChepB lungu, subject to an obligation to receive certain Dorobo, is M equitable settlement of all rights, both tribal and private, and : ill all Lumbwa claims of right on the farms should now be efl distinguished. Natives will have the option of signing squatter contracH or going to live in the reserve or in the block which is recommemlffl to be added. ; fahe 1847. We do not find on the evidence that any section of :fljKavirondo.       Nilotic Kavirondo has made good a claim to have lost any land ovH which private rights existed.  The question of private rights outsifl
(ON NATIVE RIGHTS OR CLAIMS OUTSIDE THE RESERVES ,bt HI-Chapter Vll]543[the reserve, therefore, iu our opinion, does not arise. The tribe as , whole may possibly be held to have suffered a very small loss of erritory in respect of Mr. Maxwell&apos;s farm, but we do not consider hat the loss was such that it need be regarded at this date, except hat we have recommended that the Kavirondo should be allowed 0hid for the farm should it come on the market.1.848. Wo find that the only loss which may be suffered by theIlantu Kavirondo is in respect of certain mining operations, and ;e have made full recommendations for compensation both of the ribe and of individuals.1849. If the proposals which we have, made for additions to Tho Teitn. lie reserve, are accepted (sec section 1270 above), there will be no jrilship in extinguishing native rights outside the boundaries as (constituted. But if the recommended additions are not made, leu there tire large numbers of Teita natives living outside the serve, whose rights it would not be fair to extinguish without full compensation. It is obvious that the fairest solution is to make the Jditions as recommended, and avoid a complication of rights which raid be likely to cause the greatest embarrassment in the future.1850. The additions recommended at sections 1229 and 1230, The Taveta. v which 22J square miles would be added to the reserve as Class B, ;only augment the reserve by nearly 50 per cent. No suggestion is been made to us that any Taveta have private rights outside the serve, but, if there are any such, we are satisfied that, in view of iis large increase of the tribal territory, they may justly be ex-anged. The Native Council should be free to make such arrange-Mits as it may think fit for the pmrpose of compensating any [dividual whom it may- consider to be adversely affected.1851. Certain Duruma natives are cultivating on alienated The Duruma. aids in&apos;the Mwachi Valley, and it is clear that there was already stensive native occupation before the land was alienated. It is ated in the agreement made with the Duruma elders in 1908, liieh is quoted in section 1205 above, that any original &quot;owners&quot; ad their families cannot be disturbed without compensation. The laitn to compensation might also extend to other natives living on lie land and to the tribe at large, if the suggestion that the Duruma ere not willing parties to the original agreement is true. But, as e have already  written in section 1209 above, we doubt wdrether e are in possession of all the facts, and have therefore reeom-lended an investigation by the Provincial Commissioner.1852. Meanwhile it is clear to us that there are rights on the nd which cannot be expunged without compensation. The nature id extent of those rights will have to be ascertained. The Mwachi alley is actually situated within the ten-mile strip and is part of ie l\env.i Protectorate.

Private rights in the Const strip (i.e. the Kenya Pro! tectorate) are so involved as to be a matter for special and expej study, such as we could not have undertaken without transferrin our headquarters to the Coast  and conducting an invcsti&quot;ratio through several months.   We do not think that anything of th, kind was required of us, and we note that Government has a; pointed a Departmental Committee wdtose terms of reference ii elude this matter,  So far as wo are able to determine, native privatl rights in the Coast ten-mile strip are not susceptible of treat met by the method which we arc contemplating, and must be take] to be excluded from the scope of our recommendations.1854. We now proceed to our recommendation, which i follows : Provided that till the recommendations which we 1 made for extensions of native reserves are accepted; and vided that compensation in other forms is paid in those easel in which we have recommended it; and provided that recommendation  shall not  be deemed  to affect the Kenvi Protectorate ; we recommend the extinction of all native riglitj in land other than land gazetted as Areas A, B, or C, whet! . such rights be of tribes, groups, clans, families or individual! except such rights as may be enjoyed by individual native! under specific title issued to them.Further, we recommend that steps be taken to reade] section 86 of the Crown Bands Ordinance, 1915, and section: of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1902, inoperative both in exisl ing and future leases.Further provided that : -(i) The rights of labour-tenants secured upon contraij shall not be affected by this recommendation.(ii) Existing rights of grazing in the &apos;Grogan Cotj cession&apos; shall not be affected.(iii) Existing high t-holders&apos;, living on farms under tiiSJ protection of section 86 of the 1915 Ordinance ( section 31 of the 1902 Ordinance, shall not disturbed until they have reaped their crops.(Note. This recommendation should not be read in stuj sense as to deny the rights of tribes such as the Galla or Boil or the tribes resident in Turkana and the Northern Frontief to be protected by Government in the use and enjoyment land, although no reserves have been specifically set aside f^ them.)

The space given to the discussion of this matter may Numbers of uy the impression that the numbers of natives affected are than is in fact the case. The only place where the problem arisen in anything like an acute form is Kikuyu, and there it relieved that the number of persons who could justly claim the gut of section 88 and corresponding sections, and are still living the farms, is not more than two or three hundred, inclusive of men and children.1856. The disturbance likely to take place in other areas is most negligible.1857. The necessity for the recommendation has been suffi-ntly illustrated in the part of our Report which deals with the aivu. It is not too much to say that relations between the races ie becoming embittered because of the extravagant pretensions ihis tribe. Our investigations have satisfied us that, as a tribe, y have certain legitimate grievances, which we have been at as to rectify. But their claims and pretensions were exaggerated of all proportion to the truth, and we find it essential to the lire well-being, both of the tribe in particular and of the country large, that the settlement now proposed should be definite and il, and therefore it was absolutely essential to be rid of such ential fruitful sources of trouble as section 86 of the Crown Lands Snance. Moreover, if we are to consider what facilities natives lit to have in respect of land outside the reserves, it is essential i we should start from a firm basis and not be encumbered by existence of ill-defined and nebulous claims.11858.

A memorandum produced in evidence compute the number of Ivikuyu resident outside their reserves to be as marl as 110,000 (inclusive of women and children), and most of the: are squatters. The total from other tribes is not so formidable, arj the sum total of all squatters may probably be found to be in tl neighbourhood of 150,000. The contract on which these native. work ensures to them a right to land on which to build a dwellii and to cultivate, and also lays down the number of stock whi may be brought on to the farm and implies a right to pastura; for them. There is also an obligation to work for a period of if less than 180 days for a wage specified. No charge or dednctio from wages is made in respect of the land.1861. In view of certain criticisms which we have read, it take this opportunity of stating that the contracts are completel voluntary, and natives go to work on the farms because it paj them to do so. The chief attraction is that they get better grazia for their stock. This is not necessarily because the land on the farrr is better than land in the reserves, nor because insufficient Jane were reserved for their legitimate needs. It is often because tli natives have misused their own land by constant overstocking.
1862. After some years on the farms, it is nearly always found the stock has improved in quality and increased in numbers, it is beyond question that labour-tenants own more than then lions in the reserves. They are able to acquire more wives and e more children, and it is computed that, for this reason, their ! of population-increase is greater than in the reserves.1863. On the expiry of the contract labour-tenants sometimes er certain disabilities, to which we shall allude, and for which shall propose remedies in so far as they relate to land and fall hin our terms of reference. But, generally speaking, it is true iv that the labour-tenant, after he has finished his contract&apos; and lined to his reserve, is materially better off than his neighbour ) stayed at home, notwithstanding that some of his cattle may when they return to the reserve, and that he may be put to ie trouble and expense, in re-establishing himself on his former1. :,      . .1864. On expiry of the period speciiied in the contract/unless Conditions onii ,      ,. . -,    ,-,     , . ...   .,     n,, .    Expiry oflabour contract is renewed, the tenancy expires with it. This Contract, it be held to give insufficient security to tenants in cases where mployer cuts down his labour force by way of retrenchment through no fault of the labourers themselves. In the case of a tter family which has been absent from the.native reserve for al years, the disturbance might be serious. It would therefore tssible to argue that, when the tenant has performed the terms 5 contract faithfully and is willing to renew it, he should not be a! without compensation.But such a provision, though on the face of it just, would ni prove of practical assistance to the tenant, and would cer-t lead to a number of bogus claims. We consider it a better ion at this stage of the country&apos;s progress that Government d accept the obligation of finding land to which time-expired ters can go, either in their own reserve, or, if they prefer it, Areas, and that care should be taken to arrange the move seditiously and cheaply as possible.IS65. It is represented that in the case of the Kikuyma returned Special tier family often has a difficulty in re-establishing itself in the Kifuvu16&apos; ve, either because it belongs to an mbari which lost Its land msequence of the alienations which took place in, the first .....,&apos;.V..ie of the century, or because other right-holders on . their. h.i have extended the area of their cultivation and there is no: left for them.545ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES III-chapter VIII] . -
ON FACILITIES EOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Part HI-Charter VIII]1866. We consider that these allegations are much exaggera but have a certain degree of truth in some cases. The existent a Kikuyu Native Deserve iiiijjiiea that every Kikuyu must hav right to live.in it, as least as a tenant, and we feel that then some danger that the conception of private rights in Kikuyu r be pressed to an extent which is incompatible with this requiremt We therefore recommend, both in respect of the Kikuyu and &quot;ei ally, that rules should be made under the Lands Trust Ordinal giving powers to District Commissioners, subject to whatever si guards may be deemed necessary, to provide for the accommodat of landless natives in their own reserve where they experie difficulty in finding such accommodation for themselves.1867. In the case of Kikuyu there should be a rule to effect that the District Commissioner, after consulting the D Board, might require any landless family to be received on ; githaka where there is room, but preferably on a githaka of same clan in an area which is comparatively sparsely inhabit Such a provision will largely remove any grievance on the sc that ex-squatter families are unable to find accommodation in reserves, while in case they&apos; may prefer to take up land on a m individual form of tenure they will have the alternative of go into C or D Areas and taking land on lease.   When one refit that the three Kikuyu districts are only 1,931 square miles extent, even with the addition of Mwea, it is apparent that possible return of 110,000 squatters would augment by 57 to square mile a population which is already dense enough to ea embarrassment.   While such a contingency as the return of the squatters and their stock need not be considered, there seem us to be good grounds for taking precautions.1868. We have recommended extensive additions to the Juki Deserves on economic grounds, and we have provided for establishment of a large C Area on the Yatta. These two facilit taken together, as well as the introduction of greater elasticity the Kikuyu system of land tenure and a greater possibility interpenetration between tribes, should go far to alleviate the di culties of finding accommodation for time-expired squatters, be adequate to meet any contingency which is likely to arise many years to come. The problem in the case of the other rese is not so urgent.1869. We now turn to the various questions concerning in natives.   There are two main aspects of the problem : (a nature of the provision required for the accommodation of n in towns; (6) The nature of the provision required for the a modation of natives who leave the towns.   In commenting
matters, we shall confine ourselves to observations of a general-tier, since our specific proposals regarding -Nairobi and Mom-have already been made.870. Without going into detail we record our opinion that Aceouvmoda-finally housing schemes, while they fulfil a useful function, are *lon. ior. inly not the whole solution of the problem of finding suitable Towns, tmodation for natives in townships.   They have three draw-;: first, they are expensive and seldom repay the money spent lem; secondly, in order to reduce losses they are bound to e a rental which few natives can afford, and therefore do not for the class of natives which is most in need of protection ; ly, they discourage native enterprise and tend to pauperization.therefore desirable that any scheme of municipal lodging-is should be supplemented by a further scheme, such as exists, ainwani, whereby the Municipality undertakes the responsi-for the layout and administration of a native location, but the es build their own houses, subject to the design being approved le Health Authority. In small townships in the Highlands, e most natives are working only on short-term contracts, it (1 not be reasonable to expect that they should build their own es. but it is probably more feasible that their employers shouldthe houses in the shape of. labour lines constructed in eon-ity with the requirements of the Health Authority. &apos; &apos;   \1871. Lodging-houses kept by natives are often undesirable     &apos; ;&quot;&apos; unions at the present stage of native development in Kenya.courses are open : suppression or improvement. In the case nail townships in the Highlands their numbers should be icted to the requirements of the itinerant population, since ing for resident natives can be provided otherwise, and regular vision would be difficult. But in larger townships, such as ru, the aim, ia our submission, should be improvement rather suppression, and native lodging-houses certainly should not be in aged merely on the ground that they compete with municipal ing schemes. They may be useful in accommodating poorer es who could not afford the comparatively high fees which municipality is bound to charge, unless the scheme is to be wed as a charity dependent on extraneous support. The keep^ of a lodging-house, if obiectionable features are removed, is a imate enterprise which should not be discouraged, except in small towns, but should be subject to licence and strict rvision both by the Health Authorities and by the Police.1872. We regard it as of special importance that native quarters wnships in the European Highlands should not become centres re natives discharged from farms mav congregate in preference etnrning to their reserves.   It would hardly be practicable toON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES II-Chapter VIII]
ON FACILITIES FOlt NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Part III-Chapter VIII]restrict native residence in such townships entirely to natives wl are actually employed in them, but we consider that the regulntio should be strict and should keep that general end in view.1873. In townships which are not in the European Highlani it is less objectionable that quarters should be found for urbanizi or detribalized natives, even though they have no work in the tow and therefore the formation of garden colonies in proximity to ti towns, as for instance at Makindu, is not altogether to be ruled oc We have already shown that the success of such enterprises is vei doubtful, but we think that they have a better chance of succe in D Areas, especially down-country, since natives who wish leave the settlement can more readily obtain alternative land eh where, if not as owners, then as tenants to some Arab or nati landowner on the Coast.1874. It is perhaps an observation worth making that the lea difficulty in respect of native housing is experienced on the Coa; where most of the land is privately owned, and natives general make their own arrangements with some landowner. In the circumstances, the task which devolves on Government is not much the provision of land for native settlements as the devisi of rules for the protection and greater security of tenants.Accoimuada- 1875. It is a short-sighted View to suppose that urbanizNatives who natives must of necessity be unsuited by conditions of life in th leave (he own reserves, or that townships will not grow up in the resen 1 ^ &quot; where they may live in congenial surroundings.  Plans for tonships in native reserves will certainly have to include resident sites for natives. It may also be expected that considerable villa; and possibly townships will grow up in C Areas.1876. Again, it must not be supposed that many of the nati who live in the towns have become so thoroughly deruralized t they could not resume an agricultural life and be content..1877. We therefore recommend that the general method dealing with natives who are not wanted in the towns, and h no means of honestly supporting themselves there, should be return them to their reserves. If they do not wish to remain tin they have the alternative of taking up land in C or D Areas.1878. In respect of any native of uncertain origin, who t be ordered to leave a town as a vagrant and protests that he nowhere to go, we recommend that the District Commissioner such other authority as may be appointed, should have the p( to determine, after due inquiry, the tribe and reserve to w such native properly belongs, or with which he has most affii and that there should be a power to send him to such a rese
ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES III-Chapter VIII]lie does not like the life there, he would probably not have much Jjiculty in arranging to be received as a tenant in a C or D Area, if he can find the capital, in taking up land there.J879. We now turn to the consideration of C Areas, and the loh^^ of ilities to be enjoyed by natives in them.   The following is a icdule of the areas which we recommend to be C Areas. They are jjwn on the map following section 2152 : TABLE No. 4. Schedule of Native Leasehold Areas. (Native Areas Class C.)Approximatearea in Square Mitesi The area between the Mwita Siano river on the Yatta and the Kitui Native Reserve :is shown on the map following section 796.The land to the south of the Uaso Nyiro river, lying on both sides of the Ngare Ndare in the Northern Frontier Province; being the areas marked 2 and 4 on the map following section, 884 but excluding : (a) Such part of the area 2 as may be wanted for theMukogodo.(b) Such part of the area 2 as may be required for vetcrin-ary purposes or in connexion with a fertiliser fac-tory.(c) The eastern end of the area 4.Note. The total extent of the area contained in 2 and 4 is approximately 1,150 square miles. After making allowances for (a), (b) and (c) above, we may set down the balance roughly as 7C0 square milesThe area shown as &quot; E &quot; on the map following section 7C0 to the Report. It is the area to the south eastward of Mbagathi Township Reserve, described at section 7C6 of the Report. Its constitution as a Native Leasehold Area must be contingent on the necessary arrangement being made with the Masai . .170700699391880. We recommend that every C Area should be under the Supervision division and control of the Provincial Commissioner in whose ?,ncl Conlrol of ivince it is situated, and that he should deal with it through an isory body constituted on the lines of a Local Land Board in a ive reserve.  As the area becomes more occupied and settled, a eal Native Council might be, constituted, from whose members &apos;1 Local Land Board would be chosen with the District Commis-Iner as chairman. &apos;
ON FACILITIES FOB NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Part 111-CiiAFren VIII]Methods by which   Natives should apply for Land.Method of granting Original Applications from Natives.Forms of Lease.Reason for allowing Group Holdings.1881. We have already recommended (section 1409) that tfj external boundaries should be under the protection of an Ordc Council and of the Lands Trust Board, and we now recomtnenl that any rules made for the management and control of land C Areas should be under the Lands Trust Ordinance. We considJ that the Governor should have the power to make such rules, subjecj to a power of disallowance by the Secretary of State.1882. We consider that natives wishing to obtain land Areas should apply through the District Commissioner of the] reserve, except that in cases in which they are living a long from their reserve they should be ttble to apply through the Distrii Commissioner of the district in which they are living.  The Distrii Commissioner should help them  to make their applications suitable form, and should forward them to the Commissioner Lands with his remarks.1883. It will no doubt be possible for standard forms of applic; tion to be devised to suit the various types of lease required. Tlii will be of advantage, provided that it does not lead to excessiv standardization.1884. The Commissioner of Lands should have the power granting or refusing original applications from natives after refeJ ence to the Chief Native Commissioner.   Provided that he shoull not grant an application to which the Chief Native Commissions objects.   When an application is granted, the Commissioner Lands should execute the lease.1885. We are strongly opposed -to any measures which woull seek to confine the various forms of lease too rigidly into categoriej If we discuss in too great detail the conditions which should imposed, we may convey the impression of attempting to sterej type.  We shall therefore deal only with the leading features, the major safeguards which in our opinion are essential to succes We shall first consider the conditions which should govern leasj] of land to natives.1885. We shall distinguish between three main types : Leases of land to be held on group tenure; (b) Leases of land tol held on individual title; (c) Leases to corporate bodies.  We sh describe the general conditions which we consider to be suitabl to each type, but this classification is for the sake of clearness onlf and we do not suggest that every lease should necessarily confotj to one or other of these patterns.18S7. Seeing that C Areas are primarily intended for nativj who desire to hold land on a more individual type of tenure tlij is possible in the reserves, the necessity for group leases may

But we are satisfied that it is too much to ex-st of natives that they should he prepared at one leap to emerge in tribalism and hold land completely on an individual basis. ieve may be some natives who are capable of doing so, and we jll provide for their needs. But the generality of natives certainly U be better suited at this stage by a type of holding which still serves features of the group control to which they are accustomed der the tribal system, but which is capable of being transformed i subdivided into individual holdings as the natives become fitted them.1S88. Since the applicant for a lease might be either an in- The Titular idual or a family, or a family group, or even a collection of ftfethod^of1 ires applying in common, much confusion will arise, unless it is Succession de clear who holds the title and how it passes by succession and jj ij&quot;,&apos;&quot;!&apos; iiiiance.  We must be assumed, in what follows, to be consider-      &apos; the case of pagan or Christian natives, and afterwards we shall mine whether any modification is needed in the case of Mp-nmedans.1889. We consider that whenever a lease is granted in respect jfamily or group of related families, the lease should be issued the name of the senior representative, who should be regarded die seigneur. But if the persons for whose benefit the lease is ,ied are a group of unrelated or loosely related families or in-iluals, then they should be required to enrol themselves as a prate body, with a clear method of inheritance, before the lease issued.1890. We believe that it is a sufficiently accurate statement of Bantu system of inheritance to say that there is a power of iory or general control or supervision which passes to the senior -, while the property itself is distributed among all the heirs by hods varying slightly according&quot; to local custom, an undistri-ed residue sometimes remaining with the senior heir. Those, odispute the truth of this statement in regard to the inheritance and, will probably admit it in respect of other property. Among :ribes of Kenya, Bantu or otherwise, among whom a recognizable l of right-holding in respect of land exists, we have good grounds believing that it follows these general lines.1891. We suggest that in cases where the leases have been ed to a family or family group this customary practice can be ed to good account by a provision, which could be regarded as logical extension of custom, that the title, as embodying the ,&apos;iiiory, should pass to the senior heir, but that the right of use aid be distributed. In other words, the land would be impartible sspect of title, but partible in respect of use.
Settlement of Disputes.ON FACILITIES FOB NATIVES OU&apos;i SIDE RESERVES Part III-Chapter VIII]Provision for the Prevention of excessive Sub-division *f TJser&apos;a Rights in Group Leases.1892. In so far as we are able to judge, there is nothing these   provisions  which  would  be  repugnant  to  Mohammedan methods of succession, since in distributing the user regard would be had to the due proportions fixed by Mohammedan law. But i Mohammedan group or family should be unwilling to apply onl these terms, the alternative should be open to it of applying as body corporate, stating in the application the proposed method succession and inheritance.   But the application should not beS granted unless it provides clear safeguards against uneconomic siib-l division and fragmentation and against the contingency that tin title may become encumbered by dubious rights and claims.1893. The state of things existing on the Tana Iliver, whercj titles are inextricably mixed and confusion prevails, gives a clear) warning of the necessity for these precautions.1894. Our further remarks below, unless otherwise stated, to be understood to apply to group or family leases on a basis native custom rather than to leases to corporate bodies.1895. Disputes affecting title would naturally be settled in tin ordinary courts of the Colony. But disputes might also occur be tween &quot;right-holders&quot; or tenants, when a large area inhabited b; several families is comprised under a single lease. We recommeni that the lessee, as &quot;seigneur&quot;, should be arbitrator, but that, whei he has given his arbitration, if the parties refuse to accept it, the; should be able to file a suit in a native tribunal to be constitute under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, subject to revision am appeal as provided in that Ordinance and with the Provinciaj Commissioner as the final authority.1896. In all cases of family leases it would be necessary provide against the possibility that the land might become es cessively subdivided in use because of the number of right-holdersj or that some right-holder might leave the land and yet retain interest, which would be inherited by his heirs after him, witg the result that the land would become burdened with vague anl nebulous rights. To this end we recommend : (a) That, if a righ holder has been absent from the land for more than three years, arj has made no use of the land either himself or by agent, the seigneJ should be able to approach the Local Land Board for a declaratirf that such right-holder has forfeited his rights, and, if the Loci Land Board agrees, such rights shall be forfeited, subject to a rigl of appeal to the Provincial Commissioner: (b) That, subject to ta approval of the Local Land Board and the Provincial Commissions the lessee should have the power to buy out superfluous right-holder) Provided, firstly, that he should not be able as a matter of ordinal practice to buy out his senior heir or that heir&apos;s immediate fan:if or any old or decrepit persons who by native law and custom ai
549ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES HI-Chapter VIII]ependent on him 1&apos;or support; and, secondly, that any person grieved in respect of the amount of compensation offered or in Kpect of the redistribution as between right-holders should have he right to file a suit in the native tribunal.1897. It will sometimes happen, when a lease of a large area  [^&quot;^evention is been given to a group, that the holdings of individual right- of excessive oklers would tend to become excessively fragmented, as they often J\ljng&quot;fe,user&apos;8 ounder the githaka system. It is most important that this should Rights in e prevented.  Although large group-holdings are suitable to natives GrouP Leases, ho have,not yet fully,emerged from tribalism and should therefore t allowed in the early stages of the occupation of C Areas, it is ortain that leases must ultimately take a more individual form, t is therefore essential that individual shares in group holdings would remain consolidated, so that, when the time is ripe, sub-vision of the lease may take place until eventually the group estate broken up into private estates secured by separate leases.1.898. We therefore recommend that the lessee should have offer, with the consent of the Local Land Board and the District emmissioner, to consolidate the holdings on his land by means of redistribution between right-holders; provided that any right-older aggrieved by the redistribution might file a suit in the native nal. We are further of opinion that if the lessee fails to the necessary steps to keep the right-holdings on his land iisonably consolidated, the District Commissioner, with the ap-roval of the Docal Land Board, should require him to consolidate em, and, if he still fails to do so, the Provincial Commissioner ould have power to recommend the cancellation of the lease, and at, subject to the consent of the Chief Native Commissioner, the ommissioner of Lands should cancel it. The apparent harshness this provision would, no doubt, be mitigated in practice by giving e lessee a reasonable period in which to dispose of the land by proved transfer.1899. It should be lawful for any right-holder having a share J&apos;e1*0Jrijii&quot;ua any group holding to apply for a separate lease to be issued to Subdivision of mi in respect of his holding, which would then become distinct 7/Q^,QU1SjgUed om the pai-ent holding.   The application should be made to the   0   &apos;oups&apos; ovincial Commissioner, who should consult the Local Land Board fore making his recommendation.  If it is found practicable, we nsider that the Provincial Commissioner should be empowered to tie leases in respect of such subdivisions of main blocks, a local ;ister being kept in the office of the District Commissioner.  It is portant, however, that subdivision should not be allowed to an tent which is uneconomic.
ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Part HI-Chapter VIII]Transfer of Lease in the ease of Group Leases.Consideration paid for Transfer in respect of Group Leases.Tenants.1900. Transfer of the lease by means of a sale of the whole block comprised by the group lease should only be allowed with the sanction of the Provincial Commissioner after consulting the Local Land Board. Transfer of subdivisions should be subject to the same conditions. Provided that temporary pawning of the use of land in accordance with native law and custom should be deemed to be permissible by verbal arrangement, save in so far as the practice may be prevented or restricted by rule.1001. The consideration paid for transfer of a group lease should be paid to the lessee from whom the land is transferred, and he should make distribution to such right-holders as have a right] to receive a share. Any right-holder aggrieved should be able file a suit in the native tribunal.1902. Tenants should be allowed, and should be deemed to! have the rights which  they would have under native law andl custom, save in so far as they by rule.Transfer ofIndividualLeases.InheritanceIndividualHoldings.ofmay be regulated and safeguardcLease of Land on Individual Title.1.903. When the applicant for a lease is a single individual, he should state in his application whether he wishes (a) to hold the! land as a group-holding, i.e. as the founder of a family group! among whom succession would pass as already described ; or (b) to! hold it on individual title, in which case the land would be held! on similar terms to those on which leases are ordinarily granted toj Europeans.1904. We do not think it right to prescribe any maximum orl minimum size of land which should be allowed to be leased onj individual title. In our opinion, it is a sufficient safeguard to pro-I vide, as we have already suggested, that no lease should be issued) to which the Chief Native Commissioner objects. The chief factor in the decision would be the use for which the land is required, and the ability of the applicant party to make adequate use of it for the purpose specified, and the Chief Native Commissioner would naturally take steps to satisfy himself on these points by consulting the District Commissioner and the Local Land Board.1905. We recommend that the lessee should not be able to subdivide, sublet, sell or transfer his interest in the land without the sanction of the Provincial Commissioner, who should consult the Local Land Board before giving his decision.1906. When the land has been leased as an individual holding, it is important to ensure that it should be maintained as such. We therefore recommend that when the lessee dies intestate the title should pass by primogeniture. But we consider that the lesse1 should be able to.dispose of the land by will, subiect to the follow in provisions : (1) That he should not bequeath it as an inheritani
ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Mir III Chapter VIII]be held in common ; (2) Thai, although he might dispose of it &apos; specific bequest of particular shares, no share should be smaller Ilium a certain minimum; (3) That, when the land has been be-Licathed in shares, a separate lease must be executed in respect lof each share, which then becomes a separate holding; (4) That if will infringes the above conditions, the Local Native Tribunal should advise on a settlement which does not infringe these con-[iitions but otherwise preserves, in so far as possible, the intention the testator; and the Provincial Commissioner should decide, it is impossible to arrive at any such settlement, the will should ! null and void.1907. It will sometimes happen that a right-holder in a group Conversion of lioiding obtains leave to have his share detached from the main hnHjJjgg to use by subdivision, and have a new lease issued to him.  In such Individual jse, he might desire that it should be registered as an individual    0 lnKS&apos; lolding, and not as a group holding.  We consider that this should ij permissible with the consent of the Provincial Commissioner, [his gives a clear method for the devolution of group holdings and iheir piecemeal and gradual conversion into individual holdings, rhich we take to be the general end in view7.1908. The distinction is that, in an individual holding, the tie cannot become encumbered by any rights of share-ownership a the part of co-heirs. In a family or group holding co-heirs have ights of user which can only be voided by purchase.1909. When land is leased to unrelated groups, so that no one Land Leased srson can be said to be the seigneur by native law and custom, Bodies!&apos;01 re recommend that the lease should not be granted until the appli-mts have enrolled themselves as a corporate body, with a recog-ized method of succession. We recommend that no such lease liould be granted unless it is made clear, either by clauses in the ise itself or by some rule governing the matter, that due pro-sion exists by which the land can be kept free from the difficulties aused by uneconomic subdivision or fragmentation.1910. We are inclined to think that this form of lease will be rainly suitable for special forms of enterprise, as for instance when group of natives want to lease a piece of land on which to build church. It would also be suitable for co-operative agricultural aterprises, but the greatest caution would be needed in devising he terms of the lease, and it will probably be wise to refrain from suing such leases until considerable experience has been gained a the administration of C Areas, and the difficulties likely to be ^countered are better understood.

We recommend that the normal period for which a leas should be issued should be for thirty-three years, but it should bj renewable if the lessee has complied with the conditions.  This an the following recommendations apply to all classes of lease t natives in C Areas.1912. We see no reason why the original allotment of lan should not be by auction between approved applicants, but w regard this as a matter of administrative detail, on which we mat no specific recommendation.1918. The rents should be fixed so as to give a fair economi return to the Government, but regard should be had to the ris which the pioneers in C Areas will take, and, in our opinion, th consideration would justify a very low assessment of rents ni stand premia in the early stages.1914. We also make the suggestion that payments should 1 made, in a large measure, in the form of stand premia, so thai the rents may not be burdensome.  Fees for registration and trans] fer should he low; otherwise deaths will not be reported, and authorized transfers will take place.1915. The. lease should be subject to conditions of develop! ment, conservation and use. The conditions of development neei not be exacting, but the conditions of conservation should be siriciS and should provide against the wanton destruction of timber ol pasture, or the damaging of any watercourse. A certain maxinninl number of cattle, sheep and goats which the land may carry shoalfl be specified, but that number should be liable to revision.1916. In respect of use, the lessee should be required to keeJj the shares of individual right-holders consolidated ; to demarcatS boundaries in such a way as may be required ; and to furnish ana returns in respect of the number of right-holders or tenants oJj the land as the District Commissioner may direct.1917. If the conditions of the lease are infringed, the Districts Commissioner, after consulting the Local Land Board, and afteH due warning to the lessee, should make representations to thl Provincial Commissioner, who should require the lessee to comphjB with the conditions forthwith. If he fails to do so, the ProvinciaH Commissioner should be able to recommend the cancellation of thl lease, and the Commissioner of Lands, after consultation with thjj Chief Native Commissioner, should have the power to cancel it.1918. We recommend that no native shall have the power tl mortgage his land without the sanction of the Provincial Commisf sioner, which should only be given in cases in which it is sought tc mortgage the land to the Land Bank or some other institution approved by Government.
551ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES pur 111 Chapter will]1919. In our opinion survey is not necessary, but demarcation Suryoy, 0n site is necessary.   The Provincial Commissioner should have Registration power to direct, after consultation with the Local Land Board, in Demarcation, jliat manner the boundaries of the land leased are to be demar-(jtcd, and in the case of group leases should a;so have the power to prescribe the manner in which the right-holders&apos; shares should be eniiircated.   &quot;We suggest that hedges with occasional standards it be suitable for marking external boundaries, and hedges itliout standards might be used to mark right-holdings.  But this point of detail.1920. We consider that the District Commissioner should keep he register, and that it should be as simple as possible.1921. There should be the usual special clauses enabling the ;nvernment to conduct roads, telegraphs, etc., through the land; Leases, to resume any land required for public purposes upon payment compensation. We recommend also a clause to provide for for-tttre in the event of rebellion or sedition.1922. It is most important that there should also be a clause committing  specifically that the terms of the lease may be varied by uclamation or rule under the Lands Trust Ordinance, which may either of general or special application.1923. In recommending that it should be possible to modify Modification e terms of leases by means of proclamation or rule, we are follow- &quot;f Leases Try 2 the precedent of the Quit Bent Titles in the Transkeian Terri- Proclamation &apos;ies of the Union of South Africa.  There the Governor-General or Ruln-; the power to modify the conditions of the title by proclamation, 1 has in fact made use of the power to do so. The reason for the svision is clearly that the form of land tenure granted to natives, :-re as well as here, cannot be regarded as final, but must be iified from time to time as natives become fitted to exercise a ;r freedom in matters relating to the owning and disposition of I. For instance, although the Quit Bent System was inaugur-ed in the Transkei in 1898, the natives were not given powers of insfer and sale, and the embargo was still in existence when the rath African Economic Commission issued its Beport in 1932, which a limited freedom to buy and sell is recommended, but ly up to a certain maximum.1924. Circumstances may require us in Kenya to proceed some-at more rapidly, and it appears to be necessary, even at this ie, to allow a limited freedom to buy and sell in C Areas. but more rapidly we are compelled to advance, the greater the office of making mistakes, and the greater the necessity for such provision as is here proposed. It will have the double purpose of

The criticism is likely to be advanced that our proposa regarding the leasing of land to natives in C Areas are too con plicated. We reply that it is a complicated matter, and we ai satisfied that for the successful settlement of a native population i a C Area there must be a form of tenure which is not entire! divorced from native custom.1926. The alternative would be direct leases to individual and it is doubtful whether, in settling&apos; a native population in [ C Area of some 30,000 acres, for example, it would really be lei complicated for the Commissioner of Lands to grant a. large numb of leases to individuals, than to grant a smaller number of bloj lenses to family groups.1927. An advantage of the group lease is that it allows moJf freedom.  Local arrangements may be made between right-holds in a single holding and redistribution of internal boundaries betwee them may take place without reference to Government. Inheritara and succession of user&apos;s rights inside the total area of the grorJi holding is determined by native law and custom, or in the case ( Mohammedans by Islamic law.  The seigneur becomes in effect tl local agent, and the danger is avoided of cramping development! excess of registration and record.1928. But in a system of small holdings, complicated questiorj of inheritance will be constantly coming before Government decision.   For instance, the lessee dies, leaving no sons, and ttfl inheritance is disputed.  Or a man inherits two holdings, one froi his father and another from his uncle, and then dies intestat leaving two sons; does his eldest son get both (vide section 1901 or do they get one each? In a group holding it is only when seigneur dies that such questions arise, and it is very seldom thi there would be any dispute as to who is the legitimate successor.!1929. The respective merits of a system of small holdings fl natives and a system based on group tenure have been examine! at length in the memorandum, which stands in evidence, in whiJ the Kikuyu system of land tenure is compared with that obtainil in the Transkei. The argument is not capable of compression nil a small space, and we have therefore directed that the part of the memorandum which is relevant to this discussion be printed wifl the record of the evidence (vide Evidence, pp. 1069-1098). We fin
ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Ijbt HI-Chapter VIII]rselves in general agreement with the arguments and main con-isions, and as far as the present question is concerned we are satis-led that the most important points in the issue of leases in C Areas(i) That excessive uniformity should be avoided, and that itshould be possible to lease both large and small areas.(ii) That some leases should be on a group or family basis,preserving the essential features of native tenure but em-bodying safeguards, and some on an individual basis.uii) That there should be means of gradual conversion of group leases into individual leases.(iv) That freedom of action and enterprise should not be stilled by excessive regulation.!v) That whatever system is applied, it should not be conceived as final, but should be capable of adaptation to changing conditions.1930. We consider that it should be possible for land to be Conditions lased to non-natives : (a) on a .short-term lease for any purpose, in LeasesTopart of a 0 Area as is surplus to the immediate or near future Non-nativea in Jquirements of the natives; (6) in any unalienated part of a C Area &quot;c&quot; Areas-tit purpose which is beneficial to the natives, the lease being for Jch period as may be considered necessary.1931. In cases under (a), the Commissioner of Lands should ktiute the lease subject to the approval of the Chief Native Com-fosioner. The Provincial Commissioner should be given an oppor-[nity of making recommendations as to the proposal.1932. In cases under (6), the consent of the Lands Trust Board ould be necessary, except that, if the Lands Trust Board objects J the Governor considers it to be of importance to the Colony it the application should be granted, he should be able to appeal the Secretary of State, who should decide. iVote. Applications as under (6) should also be possible in ses where the land has already been alienated, provided that the sees are willing to sell and the transfer is sanctioned by the Bvineial Commissioner.1933. The difficulty of settling large numbers of natives in un- importance of miliar surroundings in untried areas will be less acute if facilities encouraging e granted for a few large enterprises conducted by Europeans or Enterprises, her non-natives.  They will help the natives by developing the sources of the country, by offering employment, and by creating local market for produce.   While large agricultural enterprises any kind would serve a useful purpose in this regard, those are specially to be encouraged which admit of a high degree of co-seration with natives.
\ON FACILITIES FOR NATIVES OUTSIDE RESERVES Part 111 Chapter will]Importance of nn Economic Surrey and a Lay-out Plan.Facilities for Natives in D Areas.1934. As the C Areas fill up and a resident native population becomes established, the conditions governing leases to non-natives should be made more exacting, and only such undertakings should be allowed as can show a clear and direct benefit to the natives But a policy of rigid exclusion against non-native enterprise is nevei likely to be wise, and we are anxious that the preference which natives are to have in these areas should not be interpreted in that sense.1935. We recommend that an economic survey of each 0 Are? be made, and that a layout plan be devised showing the site oi proposed roads, social service centres and trading centres. Howeveii often it may be necessary to alter it we consider that such a plan should exist, and it is likely that a timely planning in advance ol requirements will sometimes save Government the expense oi having to reacquire alienated land which may afterwards be found to be needed for public purposes.1936. We find no occasiou for making recommendations in regard to the method of tenure of land by natives in D Areas. Our general recommendation on the question is that natives should be on the same footing as persons of other races. We do not consider that it would be wise, for the present, to issue any group leases i such areas except to corporate bodies. But use may be made of the experience gained in C Areas, and, in so far as it is found thai group leases or a modification of them could be successfully ad-ministered in D Areas, there is no reason why they should he debarred from consideration. Our general feeling on the matter however, is that tenure of land in D Areas should normally confor to civilized practice.
553CHAPTER IX.I    DEFINITION OF THE EUROPEAN HIGHLANDS.1937. The sixth term of reference, under which we are required The Term or lodefine the &quot;Highlands&quot;, is as follows :- Reference.I&quot; To define the area generally known as the Highlands, within which persons of European descent are to have a privileged position in accordance with the White Paper of 1923.&quot;1938. The impression is perhaps conveyed that there is an ma generally agreed, within approximate boundaries, to be the rea within which a European privilege obtains, aud that we are lerely required to determine disputed points on the boundary by sact delimitation. So far is this from being the case that a Sub-oiainittee of Executive Council, sitting in 1929, proposed a boun-sry enclosing (in round figures) some .16.000 square miles, while se Governor proposed an alternative boundary enclosing about tree times that area. These two boundaries have no points in lannon, except where they intersect, and no decision has ever em made between them. Our task therefore is much greater than :e simple resolution of a few points of doubt. The whole boundary I undetermined, and the material does not exist from which the sue could be settled by a finding on facts. Neither Lord Elgin&apos;s fdaration of 1906 nor the White Paper of 1923, which are the isic guarantees of the European privilege in the Highlands, - afford njr direct help in fixing the position of the boundary, except at .jo points on the Railway. In these circumstances, since it is spossible to state where the boundary is, we conclude that we are ipected to recommend where it ought to be.1939. Our recommendations must depend on two principal cori-lerations : (1) What inferences concerning the position of the Rindary were the Kenya Government and the public entitled to aw from Lord Elgin&apos;s declaration of 1906 and the White Paper 1923? (2) What is the present situation?1940. Seeing that we have been especially enjoined to base i recommendations on facts as they exist to-day, we regard the Iter consideration as at least as important as the former.194L The history of the matter is as follows : In May, 1905, ^y tioj3fe Land Commission, consisting of Mr. Justice (now Sir Robert) Boundaries, iinilton, Mr. J. W. Barth (now Sir Jacob Barth), Lord Dela-ere, and Mr. Frank Watkins, reported in favour of the main-nance of a European Reserve, and accepted Kiu to Fort Ternan a suitable definition &quot; without wishing to bind themselves too ssely to that area or to restrict its limits.&quot;
ON THE DEFINITION OF THE EUROPEAN HIGHLANDS Part III Chapter IX]Extension of Boundaries beyond -the Kiu-Fort Ternan Ximits.1942. In September of the same year, Sir F. J. Jackson (the Commissioner) wrote to the Land Officer : &quot; I am not aware if a definite ruling was laid down or no but it has always been understood that no large grants of Ian between Kibwezi and Fort Ternan could be taken up b Indians, and you can act on this understanding.&quot;1943. In July, 1906, Lord Elgin, as Secretary of State u the Colonies, expressed his approval of the practice then in fore of limiting land-holding by Indians (outside townships) to th areas east of Kin and west of Fort Ternan. Since settlement that time was still confined to the general vicinity of the Railway there was perhaps no great occasion for a more precise definitio at that date.1944. Lord Elgin confirmed his decision in 1908, stating thai while it was not consonant with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Covert ment to impose any legal restrictions upon any section of the com munity, grants in the Highlands should not, as a matter of admini; trative convenience, be made to Asiatics.1945. The White Paper of 1923 dealt with an objection raise by the Indian community that, whereas Lord Elgin&apos;s decision onl related to the initial grant of Government land in the Highland; it has since been stretched so as to preclude the transfer of lan from Europeans to Indians. The White Paper ruled that the exisl ing practice must be maintained as regards both initial grants an transfers.1946. No reference to boundaries was made in the White Papei It might be argued on the one hand that, in the absence of statement to the contrary, the declaration must be held to appl only to land lying between  Kiu and Fort Ternan, as contemplate by Lord Elgin. On the other hand, a large number of farms ha already been alienated outside that area under a Soldier Settlemeti Scheme restricted to Europeans, and in 1913 two farms in th Kaimosi area had been sold at an auction restricted to European-It is commonly contended by Europeans that the restriction t Europeans observed in the original alienations constituted the lan European Highlands, and that the same restriction must thereto be followed in subsequent transfers.1947. In our opinion, neither of these two views is entirel correct.&apos; We cannot agree that, when Lord Elgin set the limits the European&apos;Highlands at Kiu and Fort Ternan, it was permiss to infer that-they could never be extended or contracted. Tl obvious unwisdom of giving any such undertaking in the ini stages of a policy of land settlement should alone be proof ajrai it.   To some extent, the alienations under the Land Settlemee
554tune represented an extension, for at least they created a specialopean interest in certain areas not previously comprised in the [uopean Highlands. These alienations were made with the con-nt of the Colonial Office, and were a matter within the cognizancethe Secretary of State when the White Paper of 1923 was afted. It is probable, therefore, that specific allusion would have eta made to them in the White Paper if it had been desired tohide them from its terms.1948. But if we assume that the area of the European High-iids could be extended so as to include further upland areas which ght be considered suitable for European settlers, so also we must tune that they could be contracted by the exclusion of areas ich have proved by 3X2)erience to be unsuitable, since it would irly be a foolish procedure to reserve permanently and exclusively European use areas which had proved to be unhealthy for aropeans, but possibly healthy for Asiatics.   This, no doubt, is explanation of the permission which has been granted in a few ses for the transfer of soldier settler farms to Indians.   Farms &quot;OS, 1609, 1618, and 1586, in the Muhoroni area, are instances.1949. There is perhaps a tendency to carry the argument of of16^^^,0&quot;&quot; stability too far and to contend, as some witnesses have done, at any land which is suitable for European settlement is Euro-n Highlands.  We are not prepared to accejit that view.  Con-ions in the lowlands improve very greatly as the country is jeiied up and better housing and sanitation are introduced, and any residents of Aiombasa would not admit that the health con-tions of the town are inferior to those of Nairobi.  But, however ealthy they may become, we clearly cannot hold that lowlands highlands.1950. It is not a mere pedantic point, as if it were a mere xatlent of terminology that the European reservation has been lied the European Highlands. In a country where the immigrant iiiinunities are of more than one race, as in Kenya, where there approximately 39,644 Indians, 16,812 Europeans, and 12,166 abs, it is a fair and reasonable arrangement, in the particular cumstances of the case, to reserve agricultural land in the &quot;her and cooler areas for the Europeans, while allowing the In-ns and Arabs to take up land in the lower and warmer climates to liich they are accustomed in their own land, but, in our opinion, jt du I tl not he fair that the privilege be extended to the point of claim-; for Europeans the exclusive use of all available agricultural nd, even in the lowlands, on which they could maintain them-Ives.

Tho Proposal of the Sub-committee of Executive &quot;Council made in 1923.ON THE DEFINITION OF THE EUROPEAN HIGHLANDS Part III Chapter JX]1951. Nevertheless we have to remember that it is not thi altitude itself which renders land favourable to Europeans, but th cooler and more bracing conditions which go with it. In Keny the climatic conditions which have in the past generally been re garded as favourable to European settlement have usually beei encountered at about 5,000 feet and upwards. But it would b idle to seek a definition of the Highlands by following the 5,000 fee contour line, except as a rough general guide. Climatic condition are not uniform at all points along such a line, and there would h no logic in following it. It is a question of climate, which cai be better ascertained by considering the history of farms which hat actually been alienated on the borders of the Highland area, thai by slavish following of a contour line.1952. A very able memorandum,&quot;submitted to us by the Com missioner of Lands, which we understand to be the work of Mr C. E. Mortimer, of the Land Department, describes with accom pauying maps all the principal proposals which have been madi for the definition of the Highlands. The proposal which appear to us to accord best with the de facto situation, and also to giv; the fairest interpretation of Highlands in respect of altitude am climate, is the recommendation of the 1928 Sub-Committee ol Executive Council, consisting of the Commissioner of Lands, tht Chief Native Commissioner, and the Hon. Mr. Conway Harvey.1953. The Sub-Committee made three proposals : (a) an ori ginal proposal: (6) the same proposal slightly amended by tL omission of the Mwea area and the addition of certain words i; the form of an explanatory note; (c) an alternative proposal to b considered in the event of the proposal under (b) not provic. acceptable. All these proposals may be studied on the map at pac 2841 et seq. of the Evidence. The definition proposed in (b) wast the following terms : ;&apos; The Highlands of Kenya comprise the Administrate Districts of Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gishu, Bavine, Nakuru, Ni vasha, Laikipia, North Nyeri, Nairobi; and those parts of ti Administrative Districts of Kericho, Kiambu and Fort Ha which are not gazetted native reserves; that part of the M chakos district which is not gazetted native reserve, and whit lies to the west of Sultan Hamud Station and the eastei boundaries of farm No. L.O. 1758; the Kaimosi farms at that part of the Kisumu-Londiani district which lies east the eastern boundaries of farms Nos. L.O. 5422, 1612, Mi and 3075, and north of the northern boundaries of farms X 3075, 1621, 3076 and 1620.
ON THE DEFINITION OF THE EUROPEAN HIGHLANDSIIT III-CHAPTER IX]&quot; Note. Land in native reserves wherever situated has been excluded from the definition, in order not to restrict in any way the powers of the Native Lands Trust Board to be established under the Native Lands Trust Ordinance.&quot; 1954. The most controversial points in this definition are the Certain them boundary, which excludes Leroki. indisputably an upland Coiuwweiaial i; and the western boundary in the neighbourhood of Muhoroni. (,) i^oki have already expressed our opinion in Chapter VI of Part 11 the Report that Leroki has been rightly excluded, because of extent of the native interests involved.  The other matter has yet been discussed.1955. It appears that in March, 1924, the Commissioner of (ih The nds made the proposal illustrated by the line a a on the plan Chenielil Line, page 2842 of the Evidence, which would have placed the western lits of tho Highlands at Kibigori. In 1925, lie made an amendedposal, the line b b on the map, placing it near Muhoroni. c Hub-Committee of Executive Council, sitting in 1929, splitdiiferenco and placed it near Chemelil, at the line c c.1956. It is understood that the reasons why the Commissioner Lands amended his proposal of 1924 were partly the fact that a tain number of applications had been received from Indians, ing leave to purchase land in the area, and partly a realization t his original proposal would have placed the boundary too far ow the 5,000 feet line, and in an area which cannot with any litude be called favourable for settlement by Europeans. On the hand, by setting the line back as far as Muhoroni, he did in [ exclude a largo number of farms already alienated to Euro-ins under the Soldier Settlement Scheme. It might perhaps argued in two ways whether this impaired the European interest not. On the one hand, it is possible to point to several Euro-in the area who have sold or have asked sanction to sell to lians. On the other hand, if the Europeans of the area are aided corporately rather than individually, it is clear that their pnrate opinion would condemn such action and regard it as an ingement of privilege. We consider that the Sub-Committee Executive Council reached a fair and impartial decision on a cult question.1957. There is, however, a comparatively small block of farms aediately to the east of Muhoroni. which was alienated to Indians 1906. We recommend : (a) That this block should be deemed the present to be excluded from the European Highlands; (6) at if any plot comes into the market it should be permissible for er a European or an Asiatic to buy it; (c) That when any suchhas been bought by a European, it should thereafter be nrled in the European Highlands.

This block forms an exception to the general rule! which we recommend, that where land is neither a native reservj(iv) The Mile Zone.nor White Highlands it is to be regarded as a D Area, avail for alienation to persons of any race.)1.958. There is one part of the boundary recommended In d,,, Sub-Committee where a difficulty of interpretation occurs. It con. cerns the South Nyeri district. In its first definition the Sub. Committee included this district in the Highlands, except such part of it as was gazetted native reserve. Shortly afterwards it was agreed that the Mwea area should be added to the native reserve and the Sub-Committee, supposing that there was no longer am part of the district which was not native reserve, excluded it frora the definition of the Highlands &quot;as the whole of the South Nyeri district now lies within native reserve&quot;.1959. The Sub-Committee was misinformed. The whole of tin district did not lie within the native reserve; it contained also 52! square miles of gazetted forest reserve, part of which is in Moan: Kenya forest and the remainder in the Aberdares.1960. The draughtsman of the map which illustrates the Sab Committee&apos;s recommendation appears to have exercised discretion ii interpreting the intention of the Sub-Committee. He has include the Aberdares block of 277 square miles as part of the Highland and has excluded the Mount Kenya block. We consider that t! whole of the Mount Kenya forest reserve should be included.We consider that the position as regards the forest reserve oi Mount Elgou is on a similar footing, and should be treated o: similar lines.In making these recommendations, we are following the pre cedure adopted by the Committee with regard to other forest re serves similarly situated.   The matter is of no great practical portance, since there is no intention of any change of user and land will continue to be forest reserve.   If ever a change of should take place, the native interest will be sufficiently safeffuarde by our recommendation in section 3977 below, in which with this contingency.1961. The definition of the European Highlands, as given b the Sub-Committee, includes &quot;that part of the Machakos distrif which is not within native reserve and which lies to the west Sultan Hamud Station and the eastern boundaries of L.O. 1758 This seems clearly to include the Mile Zone to the south of tl1deal

More-, a glance at the coloured map at the end of the Report will o\v that for general suitability of arrangement it is better that block should be classed as Highlands.1969. We also recommend the addition of the following items forest reserve, which would be subject to the recommendation in ion 1977 below : Square MilesThat portion of the Mount Kenya Forest which is not included in theSub-Committee&apos;s definition ..       ..       ..       ..       . .      658That portion of the Mount Elgon forest reserve which is not included in the Sub-Committee&apos;s definition, except the areas recommended in sections 1087 (3) and 1148 ..........      213The total of all additions then becomes 911 square miles.1970.

Although the map did Europeanagree at all points with the resolution which it purported to Highlands.Irate, we found it generally preferable, as showing a closer^spondence with existing facts.1971. We first modified this map by adding in the Mile Zone, not, in common with the Sub-Committee, we hold to be Euro-ui Highlands.   We thus obtained a total area of 16,500 square les. We then made a list of exclusions totalling 715 square miles ie made in conformity with recommendations which have al-ly appeared elsewhere in our Report, and we have now proposed ditions totalling 911 square miles.   The resultant total area is S96 square miles, but the areas have not been so closely ascer-ned that reliance can be placed on the figures to the nearest unit, we therefore call the area, in round figures, 16,700 square les; their position is shown on the map which we present at the of this chapter as our definition of the European Highlands.The total amount of forest reserve in this area is approximately 50 square miles.

The serious position created by the existence of native .11H aims. rights on European farms has already been reviewed in a previous chapter, in which we have made recommendations for the ex-distinguishing of those rights upon payment of compensation in cases where it is found to be due. We recommend that, as soon as that has been done, section SO of the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1915, should be repealed, and sections 30 and 31 of the Crown Land? Ordinance, 1902, in so far as they still have force, should be re-pealed also.^Ka^mosr 1973- Tlle land in which fche Kipkarren and Kaimosi fain: iuooka. blocks are situated is native reserve, and therefore in a territorialsense cannot be said to be European Highlands. But we are asked to define the area within which persons of European descent are to have a privileged position, and since we hold that Europeans should have the same privileges in respect of initial grants and transfers of land in these two blocks as they have in the Highlands proper, we include them in the area covered by our definition, but with the qualifications that the land should remain native reserve; that all rents and other profits accruing from Crown leases should be paid to the Local Native Council; and that the natives should retain the reversionary interest.&quot;Native li   the        1974. In sections 1490 and 1496 we have recommended thai Highlands,       land in the European Highlands may only be leased to natives if it is adjacent to the native reserve concerned, and if Government and the accredited representatives of the European Highlands all agree.1975. This provision is intended to apply to any future appi;-cations which may be made for permission for natives to lea land in the Highlands, but we do not suggest that the areas whb i we ourselves have recommended to be leased to natives in native reserves, Class B2, should be subject to this condition. We pre-summon, however, that Government will not act upon any of m recommendations until they have been debated by the Legislativ Council.A point 1.970. In considering the rights of natives to land in the Euro-LaWur&quot;S pean Highlands, it is perhaps necessary to mention labour-tenants tenants. or squatters.   They have no right to the land, but they havetemporary right to use land while in employment. In our view care should be taken to ensure that the essence of the contract i-a labour contract, the employee being allowed, for his greatei comfort, to keep the number of cattle which are necessary for lib use. But if he is allowed to keep more than that number the character of the contract changes in effect, until it is predominant!;

We regard all forest reserves which are completely sur-auled by European Highlands as being included in the High-Is, and potentially subject to European privilege, if ever a age of user takes place and the land becomes available for ieultural use. But in respect of forest reserves, such as the erdares, which are bounded partly by European Highlands and tly by native reserve, we consider that any question created by nge of user in respect of any part of the forest contiguous or r to the reserve should be a special case to be decided on its rits.1978. It has to be admitted that the provision which we have onunended for natives will entail some sacrifice on the part ofEuropean community. Eeluctance to make the concession Id be natural, since it was generally believed that the gazette-it of the native reserve boundaries -in 1926 would settle the iter of native claims and requirements in respect of land for ny years to come, and a certain exasperation will naturally bethat substantial alterations have to be made so soon. But austive inquiry has satisfied us that these modifications are essary, and we consider that, when the evidence has been lied, the need for them should be generally realized.1979. These recommendations may perhaps give rise to a ura 1 apprehension among Europeans that the extent of the hiunds may be again diminished. One of the main objects of our oit has been to frame recommendations which would instil a ins of security in the minds of the natives with regard to their If, in doing so, we had only transferred the feeling of in-irity from the natives to the Europeans, we could not feel that had succeeded in our task.

CHAPTER X.\Vh.v Over-stocking is a Question relevant to -our Report.The Position about 1900.An 1920..THE POSITION CREATED BY UNECONOMIC ACCUMTJ TION OF LIVE STOCK, AND PROPOSALS FOR AMELIORATION.1980. It may be asked why a Commission appointed to inquit into the question of native lands should devote so much spat overstocking in native reserves.     Our answer is that, under tl heading&apos; of &quot;The future needs of the natives as regards lands&quot;, tl use and conservation of their estates is at least as important the extent of the areas allotted to them ; the amount of land i quired is mainly dependent upon the manner in which it is use British Administration, by minimizing or abolishing the cause such as raiding, which frequently spreads disease, and epidemii which, uncontrolled by veterinary measures, formerly used to act: a check ou the increase of stock, has caused an enormous additie to the stock population of Kenya, wdiich gravely threatens whole future of the native lands.   This problem is the direct rest of British rule, and it is therefore an obligation on Govertime to face it and devise adequate remedies.   It is definitely not problem which can be solved by an increase of land. If the uncot trolled increase of stock be permitted to continue, then the whole Africa would be insufficient to satisfy the wants of the future.1981. We feel that these most essential points have been ne. lected in the past, and before coming to our recommendations c this difficult question we shall here briefly review the position the more important pastoral reserves, as it has developed and we see it now.1982. At the beginning of this century, in the country noi known as Kenya Colony, the cattle had been suffering for previous twenty years from a series of disastrous epidemics; numbers they were comparatively few, and the grazing was mot than ample to supply their needs.1983. With the introduction of British Administration, veta inary measures for the control of these diseases were introduce! and by 1920, the cattle population had increased to an estimar total of 3,000,000. Up to that year signs of overstocking an consequent deterioration of land and cattle were hardly noticeable.1984. We have heard evidence that twenty years ago the Ki masia Beserve was still a well-grassed country, and the Suk wet burning their grazing areas every year with a view to conlrollir
560ON OVERSTOCKING Jt III Chapter X]brass. Also, to the personal knowledge of two of our members, conditions in the Kamba Reserve and in the drier parts of the sii Reserve were still tolerable.1985. Now, in many parts where there used to be.grass, there Today, lotliing but bare earth, and, although we do not agree with some messes that, there has been a decline in the annual rainfall, there io doubt that, owing to the denudation of the soil, such rain as 5quickly runs oil&apos; the hard pan which has formed, or evaporates, 1 is of far less benefit to the land than it was when the soil was ered with grass.L986. Another serious factor; pointed out to us by several wit-ses and corroborated by our own observation, is that areas which I to be open grass plains are now being rapidly overgrown by .,e thorn bush, which absorbs the moisture and plant food at expense of any grass which may be endeavouring to re-establish If.1987. Probably about 1920, the main stock areas of the native tves had attained their optimum carrying capacity, and, al-ogli fully stocked, were not overstocked.   Since then the cattle ukition has, according to the evidence given before the Commis-by the Chief Veterinary Officer, increased to about 6,000,000, roughly speaking, doubled itself in the last twelve years. 1988. We have therefore, at the present moment, a preposter-state of affairs in the Colony, which can be summarized as iws :  A human  population of under 3,000,000 owns about 10,000 cattle, and probably many more sheep and goats.   The e majority of that population has little or no milk for the use lieniselves or their children during the dry months of the year, many parts of the reserves, the cows do not produce sufficient k even to feed their calves.   Meat consumption is far below it would be considered the necessary requirements of the natives ; annual sales, apart from sheep and goats, to outside markets not more than 20,000 beasts and a negligible amount of ghee. 1989. In the midst of plenty, the natives in pastoral and semi- Rt,al Poverty oral areas are, in fact, living under conditions of extreme AjatiVes0ral aty. After paying their taxes (which they are not always able o), money for food and clothing is practically non-existent, and continue to be so until they turn the products and increase of r large herds of stock into some more useful and fluid kind of ency.1990. As a contrast to these conditions, we may compare them the position in Australia. As given in the Official Year Book lie Commonwealth (No. 24), 1931. Australia, with a population .176,032, has 11,202,134 head of cattle.  With less than twice
ON OVERSTOCKINGPart III Chapter X]The Waste of Valuable Material in Kenya.The Similarity with Condi-tions in South Africa.the number of cattle which there are in Kenya, Australia not onlJ keeps more than double the inhabitants of Kenya on a far hi^htj scale of living, but also exported in 1929-30, 157,748,655 lb. of heel 107,663,264 lb. of butter, and 3,094,092 lb. of cheese.1991. The enormous waste of valuable material in Kenya lamentable. For example, during a period of two or three &quot;noi seasons in the Masai Reserve the cattle population will prolmbll increase by two or three hundred thousand ; a bad year ensues, ;U]J nearly the whole of that increase will die. In two months of dry year of 1929, 50,000 hides were sold out of the Kajiado distill of the Masai Reserve alone, and probably at least as many rnorl left to rot on the veldt. Similar conditions apply to other pastoral and semi-pastoral reserves, and all the time there is a steady date oration in tlie quality of the stock.There is reason t:) believe that the mortality of cattle in tfj present drought is at least as severe as in 1929, and we quote] in Appendix 10, extracts from reports furnished by the ITovinc Commissioners.1992. We have no doubt that in the last twenty years tli Kamba cattle have notably deteriorated both in size and in mi! yielding quality. The experience of the native training centrj recently established near Machakos. indicates that about 50 cent of the heifers are considered unfit for breeding purposes whel they attain maturity.1993. There is more reliable information for us concennij the Kamba Reserve than with regard to others we have mentionei but we see no reason to think that conditions in general are similar throughout other pastoral reserves in the country.1994. It may be appropriate here to quote a few extracts froj the Report of the South African Economic Commission of 1932 : Para. 69. &quot; The result is that we have now throughoi the reserves a state of affairs in which, with few exceptions, carrying capacity of the soil for both human beings and aniniJ is definitely on the down grade; a state of affairs which, mile soon remedied, will within one or at the outside two decad create in the Union an appalling problem of native poverty.&apos;Para. 71.-&quot; To what has this led? To a state of affair in which, with the exception of a few favoured parts, a nati area can be distinguished at sight, by its bareness. Oversioc ing is so general in the reserves as to have become an evil the first magnitude. Your Commissioners wish to stress t fact that unless some limit can be placed to the universal owing  stocking, the very existence of the large numbers of natives the reserves will in the near future be impossible.&quot;
ON OVERSTOCKING ,r III-Chapter X]Para. 72. &quot; In Gcluks location, actual desert conditions have in twenty years been created where once good grazing existed.&quot;Para. 73. &quot; Unless precautionary measures are taken against overstocking, the conditions in the Transkei and the native areas in the rest of the Union will be to-morrow what that of the Giskei is to-day. The same causes are at work there, and they will inevitably produce the same effects in the near future denudation, e/oHf/a-erosion, deleterious plant suc-cession, destruction of weeds, drying up of springs, robbing the soil of its reproductive properties; in short, the creation of desert conditions. These are strong words, and people who have not had the opportunity of seeing conditions in detail, as your Commissioners had, may perhaps consider the picture over-drawn. Your Commissioners must, however, reiterate them and continue reiterating them if they hope for success in bring-ing to the notice of those concerned the extreme seriousness of the evil of overstocking.&quot;Para. 92 (part of). -&quot; Measures for combating animal dis-eases have largely increased the number of cattle. Normally, this should have increased the capacity of the country for carry-ing population ; but the natives&apos; non-economic cattle outlook caused it to have an opposite effect. Overstocking even reduced the milk yield, in spite of a large increase in the number of cattle.&quot;Para. 108 (part of). &quot; Another factor in the problem of overstocking is represented by donkeys and goats, which are very destructive of vegetation. It is most desirable that steps should be taken to limit the number of these animals in re-serves.&quot;Para. 109 (part of). &quot; Any scheme to deal with the prob-lem of overstocking will have to face the question of marketing the present surplus stock. It is of no use transferring animals from one overstocked area to another. It is imperative that large numbers be slaughtered and converted to the best econ-omic use.&quot;Para. 11G (part of). &quot; The magnitude of the problem is appalling. But the problem which will present itself, if the reserves continue at their present rapid pace towards desert conditions, will be even greater and more appalling.&quot;act, much of the above Commission^ Beport on overstocking e native reserves of South Africa might have been written, Us mutandis, by us with regard to the reserves in Kenya.

The memorandum and evidence of the Chief Veterinarv Oflicer and Assistant Chief Veterinary Officer on the subject, in I,&apos;, found in the Evidence, is worthy of study.1990. In the following extracts from the Report of the Ajjri cultural Commission, presided over by Sir Daniel Hall, K.G.B. EL.D., E.E.S., there is evidence of what so distinguished uni authority thought of the conditions prevailing in Kenya in 19*29 : -Para. 117. &quot; Of the native live slock, the goats consti tute probably the greatest danger.  They not only graze closer but they attack shrubs and young trees on the higher land, mid so destroy the scrub and forest which should regulate the re-tention of water by the soil and prevent the starting of dan-dangerous erosion.   It will be remembered that to the goat wore than anything&apos; else may be attributed the -deforestation oi Greece and other Mediterranean districts, where the former soil has been completely washed away, creating on the one hand a bare hillside, and on the other swamps in the valleys.&quot;Para. 118. &quot; This process is going ou in Kenya, and will in the end deprive the native peoples of much of their means of sustenance. It is necessary to take in hand at once the reduction-tion in the numbers of live stock kept by the natives. Though the ultimate solution can only be obtained by the education of the native to treat his live stock as a means of producing fooi it will in some cases be necessary to apply immediate coinpnl-sion to get the natives to part with the stock that are in excess of what the land will carry. The conditions are not the same in all the native reserves, and the Commission proposes to treat them separately.&quot;Para. 121 (part of; re Ukamba). &quot; It is not too much io! say that a desert has already been created where grazing for merly was good, and where even cultivation existed, and tha the same desert conditions are steadily approaching tho land at present carrying stock and cultivation. The droughts of the past two seasons have intensified the rate of destruction and are causing great disturbance in the tribe.&quot; 1998. &quot;We believe that Kenya is fortunate to the extent that overstocking is of comparatively recent growth, and we do not consider the damage already done to be irreparable.This fact is perhaps one of the strongest arguments which caul be found in favour of prompt action, while the evil is still capablej of being remedied.1999. In making the foregoing quotations, we wish to reinforcfj our own strong conclusions that the problem of overstocking is grave: and urgent, and that unless immediate and decisive steps are takes
562ON OVERSTOCKINGCHAl&apos;TF.lt x Iiiiibat this ever-increasing evil, many of the native reserves will -iriovably ruined and their inhabitants reduced to a state * on starvation.   The process of denudation and destruc-oiice started, continues at an ever-increasiug rate as the stock ply at compound interest, and the longer firm action is delayed ater will be the difficulty and  expense of restoring the to prosperity.jOOO. But there is another side to the picture which we prefer sage.   The native reserves of Kenya contain some of the drying land in the world, and should be capable, not only ividing ample supplies of meat and milk for their inhabitants, o of exporting large quantities of dairy produce.  This would not only to their own wealth but also to the wealth of the of which they are a part.   The potential working capital development of these estates is present in the shape of stock and the annual increase.   If these estates were pro-developed, and the revenue, or part of it, accruing from the (I of surplus stock applied to their betterment in the shape iit water supply, fencing, dipping, and all the other improve-with which the intelligent European farmer develops bis the future of these reserves is indeed bright. The lands would irry even more stock than they do now, and of a better , producing wealth for the native inhabitants.Xtl.  The disastrous losses from drought which now occur ally would be memories of the past; the pastoral natives then have money which he now lacks with which to buy from his agricultural kinsman, who, in his turn, would be in obtain cheap animal fertilizer products for the renovation oiiservation of. his lands.   All this would promote the free &quot;tion of money in and between reserves and encourage the unent of the subsidiary industries which are at present so ;ded; and the Government, as trustees, could feel that sere carrying out their trust, not only as now in the letter, the true spirit of honest guardians.(12. Tn view of the remarks which here follow, and lest any-mild construe them as in any way reflecting on the officers &apos;ible for the administration of the native reserves, we desire tribute to the work which they have done, and are doing, 1 betterment of the native and his land.

Since the Great War, it has been difficult for Govern ment to lay down a steady, continuous policy of development fo the native reserves. In all the circumstances, it is remarkable tha any progress has been made, and -the credit for what has beei done must largely go to the District Officers who have displays such untiring devotion and ability and to the agricultural technical staff who have assisted and advised them.2004. Unless, however, in a matter which so closely affects ilij native as destocking, a clear and definite policy is laid down bj headquarters, and an officer can be assured of the fullest supped and sympathy in what will be at first a thankless and most d illicit! task, there may be a natural inclination to minimize the evil, the hopes that matters may last out his time, and Aprcs moi deluge.   Realizing this, we record our opinion that any policy destocking should be one laid down by Government on compr hensive lines, and must have as its main consideration the fa that there is a definite relation between the area of the land and tl stock which it can support.   Unless this relationship is constant borne in mind, and the principle adhered to, even further deterior tion of both the land and the quality of the stock is inevitable.2005. In a country such as Kenya, where the native looks t his stock as currency, and not as a productive asset, and wire mere numbers count far more than quality, where, in fact, t question of stock is interwoven in every direction with the nati habits and customs, tho solution of the problem is indeed d illicit Radical and drastic attacks on deep-rooted customs are repugna to the general principles of British Administration, and may ev lead to unrest and resentment among the natives concerned.2006. We would point out that the urgency of action agail overstocking has been pressed on Government for many veal A Committee to inquire into the disposal of surplus live stock al hides and skins was appointed in 1927.   Sir Daniel Hall&apos;s An cultural Commission, wdiich reported in 1929, laid great stress the seriousness of overstocking in native reserves, especially Kamba Reserve, and made recommendations.   The Crop Trod tion and Live Stock Ordinance was put on the Statute Book 1926.   For various reasons, this Ordinance has not been put i operation, except in minor details, and no effective action has bej taken to implement&quot; the reports just mentioned.
56ON OVERSTOCKING[II-Chapteb X]2007. As we have already stated, we are fully alive to the Our ;ulties of the situation caused by the deep-rooted native con-     pheCiat*on ion of stock as the only source Of wealth, bound up as it is Difficulties, the religious significance which is attached to them.2008. We also fully appreciate how much better it would be if natives could be made to understand the necessity for de-king, and if the Government could get their support for suchlicy.&apos;009. It has ben urged that the only course in this connexion wait until, by a process of education, the natives&apos; consent has won; but we are convinced that, except possibly in the casele of the more advanced tribes, such consent would not be lined for many years, and probably not for one or two gencra-:, by which time the progressive ruination of pasture landsdeterioration in the quality of the stock would have reached a stage that any action would come too late.2010. The fact that large numbers of native cattle are the ject of trusts, whereunder several persons have an interest inbeast, in itself precludes the possibility for years to come of lining consent to the culling of stock. It is, iu our opinion, a taken kindness to await the time when the almost inevitable irrenco of drought and pestilence will take its toll of hundreds housands of animals and so bring a temporary respite to thegrazed pastures, only to be followed again by dreary cycles iverstocking and epidemics of disease.2011. We therefore recommend, with ail the emphasis at our Tho Th-seney limand, that action be taken with the least possible delay to tor Action, agurate the culling of surplus stock and to pursue unremittingly aiicy of contrclling the cattle population within the limits which I grazing facilities available from time to time dictate. 2012. We should make no such recommendation if we were Tbo satisfied that, in spite of all the difficulties, such a course is Practibilrjjy leticable.   This opinion is already&quot; shared  by several of the pro^proposals. lor administrative officers upon whom will fall the burden of ug that the task is carried out.  They realize that such measures not be popular, and may cause strained relations between the pinistratiou and the natives, but they feel that no other course Justified, and, as one of tliem has stated, whenever droughts jir and steps have to be taken to confine the cattle within the pdaries set to the tribes, a similar situation already arises and continue to arise, but carries with it no amelioration of the addition .
ON OVERSTOCKING1&apos;aht III Chapter X]201-1. Before setting out our proposals, which follow in broj &apos; &apos;&apos; outline those which have already been made in the Reports to wliij.... we have alluded, there are one or two further points which we wislto emphasize. There is no stage of the operations reconimendtT at which the food supplies of the pastoral tribes will he detrimental! affected. They will throughout have adequate supplies of meat arj blood, and the milk available, will never be diminished but wil progressively augmented. The amount of stock available for marriage transaction will for the time being be less, but will ahvafl be greatly in excess of that which they had in the early days of century, and will later increase by degrees until it exceeds til present amount. Prom the beginning their actual material positiol will be improved, even though they receive only four or five shilling for each beast which is culled.Proposals for 2014. We now turn to the proposals which we have to makjAmelioration. Demonstrationor remedying the present dangerous situation.20.15. We consider generally that the mere addition of more land to the reserves would do little to solve the problem, thonu in certain cases some additions are necessary upon economi grounds and in order that reconditioning of the devastated area may be undertaken. The ideal to be aimed at is to educate, th natives in better methods of animal husbandry, in the eeononii use of their land and stock, and to bring home to them by ever possible means the calamitous results of overstocking, both in thei own interests and those of the country at large.2016. Although such education has not been neglected, w recommend that it be pressed forward persistently, widely am more intensively than hitherto.   We think that a great deal eai be done by teaching and demonstration at the veterinary traininj centres (which have, so far, in our opinion, given insulin ien attention to the question of overstocking), by boundary fenciiiM bush fencing, paddoeking, resting of grazing grounds, recondition ing, and the development of such systems as the kisesc amongst thi Kamba.   We believe also that much can be, accomplished by adfl ministrativeT officers working through the Local Native Council and tribal authorities, by agricultural officers, veterinary oBicerf and even by the Education Department.   The natives must learj to limit the numbers of their stock to the carrying capacity of till land, and at the same time improve the land and the quality ol their cattle.   Communal grazing, with its resultant inequalities should be controlled, and the system gradually superseded by onl of private tenure.   Efforts should also be made to change till superstitious and religious outlook of the natives towards then stock, and to persuade them to regard them more as an economiJ
ON OVERSTOCKINGi III-Chapter X]564;t. The establishment of meat markets and butcheries should be red with a view to encouraging natives to include meat as an nary article of their diet.2017:. But, as we have clearly said, and as has been so strongly iliasized in the Report of the South African Economic Com-ssion of 1930-32, it is a race; against time, and we are of opinionihe above methods of themselves cannot take effect in time to front the irreparable destruction of large areas of grazing land, (jit possibly among one or two of the more progressive tribes, ii as the Kamba of Machakos District. Other and more direct limits must, we consider, also be carried out concurrently with it of education in the proper management of live stock.201.8. The prevalence of tsetse-fly, carrying trypanosomiasis in lie over large areas of many of the native reserves, is an import-: factor in connexion with overstocking. Such areas contain th valuable grazing land (as well as agricultural land) which mot be used lor depasturing cattle, while there is over-concentra-i of stock in other parts of the reserves.2019. Bush clearing for the eradication of fly would do much ease the overstocking problem, would render available further jhsuvo areas of grazing, and so enable other parts of the reserves be rested.2020. We recommend that an extensive campaign for the clear-&apos;of the fly-infested areas be undertaken, and that the measures, ich, we understand, have met with considerable success in auanyika Territory, be studied.2021. Bush clearing, apart from the question of &quot;fly&quot;, is also -i necessary in many of the reserves in order to improve and tease the available grazing.  We have seen that thorn scrub is id I v spreading over many areas which were a few years previous-open grassy plains, but which are now practically devoid of -s and useless for depasturing cattle.   Figures quoted in Ap-lix No. 11 show that very substantial results could be obtained by it comparatively small labour force, if the effort is conducted organized.Bush r Clearing.2022. For many years past, the Veterinary Department has Quarantine inly devoted itself to the question of the eradication of stock ^J^t^ocJc ases, and a corollary of this has been the imposition of quaran-. restrictions. Most of the native reserves have been kept in lost perpetual quarantine ; the sale of cattle outside such reserves been very much restricted, and the overstocking problem has, :ensequence, been accentuated. It is futile to tell the natives t they have too many cattle for the land and at the same time iiibit or hamper movement to the markets.

In the above connexion, we would quote tlie follow!., extract (para. 84) from the Report of the Kenya Agricultural Com. mission, 1929 : -&quot; The Commission, however, doubts whether the quarah-tine regulations have been successful or even can be properly enforced, having regard to the presence of native-owned cattle in close proximity to European settlements. Meantime, ir js undoubted that the restriction of movement does impose a grave handicap upon the progress of the stock industry. Many com-petent witnesses have maintained to the Commission that thev would be better able to prosecute their business il&apos; the quaran-tine regulations were abolished. They consider that they would run no more risks of disease, whereas they would be ah! tt &apos; obtain and to sell cattle on better terms.&quot; The Commission recommends that the quarantine it gulations should receive consideration, in which the needs o the industry for freer movement and more markets should receive careful attention. In particular, rhe Commission con siders that the provision of stock roads, whereby the settleri could obtain breeding cattle from, for example, the Northen Frontier, should be facilitated.&quot;2024. We have no information as to the measures taken ti implement the above recommendations, but the fact remains tha most of the native reserves are still in quarantine for cattle, and ni provision appears to have been made for stock roads.2025. In our opinion, it is most necessary to permit of free &quot;   . movement of cattle, from the native reserves, and to provide stoc! routes in order to facilitate such movement.Stoeb Tax. 2026. The imposition of a stock tax has much to recommeniit, and has the support of so eminent an authority as Lord Moyric though he regarded it more from the point of view of taxatio than from that of overstocking. But the absence of markets lor th large number of cattle which would have to be sold to realize tha tax has hitherto precluded its introduction, and, even if sutficier markets were available, several factors militate against its succef under present conditions. We have had evidence from experience European stock farmers of the difficulties of accurately countk even comparatively small numbers of cattle, and when seven millions are involved the difficulties become very great indeei Constant movement in search of grazing, and the native method ( keeping his stock in several different places, often widely separate! are other factors against accurate assessment. We think also thi the native would generally prefer to sell a small number of his bei
ON OVERSTOCKINGji III Chapter X]x&apos;k at a good price than a large number of inferior stock at a poor je, and so its effect on the overstocking problem might be iligible.-2027. We would not, however, rule out the consideration of a ok tax in the near future, and we consider that it will be possible introduce it in the not very remote future, but it would not be ised directly to deal with the overstocking problem and would ,,&apos;iyable in cash. We have advocated a system of culling in the [owing paragraph, but we think that the time is not very far dint when it may be superseded by a stock tax. While therefore are doubtful of the practicability of a stock tax or its adequacy solving the overstocking problem under present conditions, wo ild recommend consideration of its introduction as early as sible. We would further recommend, should if be imposed, : die revenue derived from it be employed for the benefit of the ives.-2028. The Crop Production and Live Stock Ordinance was fodttced in 1926, but has never been put into force as regards j stock. It provides for the defining or limiting of the number, d, ages and sexes of the live stock to be carried on any area:promoting the improvement of the quality of the live stock; I for the disposal of surplus and undesirable live stock.2029. We are of opinion that the Ordinance is an excellent , and would recommend its application, in the first instance, on national lines, as soon as the necessary markets for meat, bloodbone products, etc., which will be discussed in a later para-ph, are available.2030. We consider that the Ordinance should be apjjlied gradu-, and be employed primarily in the areas in which devastation iking place most rapidly and where purely educational methods likely to be slow in their effect and unlikely to prevent irrepar-&apos; damage to the land within a short period. 2031. In the first year or two therefore, we recommend that ing under the Ordinance be limited to all lame, blind, worn out, repit animals of little or no value as food or incapable of breeding iekling milk.  We realize that this would, in the initial stage, materially reduce the number of stock, but might, possibly, e the opposite effect.   In succeeding years, however, culling aid become progressively more severe, and be applied to all iindant male animals and generally uneconomic beasts.   The ives should be given the opportunity of selling in a meat market f slaughtering and eating any animals which it is decided to , but should they be unwilling to do so, or the numbers render
ON OVERSTOCKINGPart III-Chapter N&apos;Jthis prohibitive, the responsible officer should kill the animals hiir sell&apos;, or through agents, if their condition renders this com able, or remove them to the nearest markel or fertilizer factor^ In the latter case, the owner would be paid the estimated value the animal, either in cash or by means of a ticket redeemable the District Commissioners office.   We would suggest that, possible, an arrangement should be made with the natives that percentage of the price paid for all animals should be credited the Native Betterment Fund, or to a fund for reconditioning, pa] docking, fencing and general improvements in the relative reserve! Fertilizer 2032. It is clear that, even with the moderate, degree of culliiFactory, proposed in tho initial stages, the total number of stock toslaughtered would be very considerable. The number of natij cattle has been estimated by the Chief Veterinary Officer at si million head, and we do not think that (his is very wide of mark. Assuming that culling measures were applied to half thj number to the extent of 7-J- per cent of them (a very modern! figure), it would mean that 225,000 a year would have to slaughtered, and many of them would be unsaleable or unfit fl human consumption. This brings us to the question of a fertili?! factory for the preparation of blood and bone meal, subsidial activities such as curing and tannin&apos;lie of fresh or driedhides, and. if possible, tl improvement in the work&quot; of meat extract for expimeat. With an economic conditions, the preparation might also be considered.2033. We wish to emphasize that, in our opinion, feri factories must be an essential corollary of any measures taken; deal with the overstocking problem, and in this connexion woi* quote the following extract (paragraph 126) from the Report of t] Agricultural Commission, 1929 : -Before such action can be taken, one preliminary st is essential : A meat factory must be established, preferal at some point on the Railway, with water facilities, to ta over the stock to lie culled.   At the outset, it is improbaM that this factory can be a paying proposition.  The live stoffl that will be culled are of such poor quality and in so low condition that little saleable meat can be obtained.  rMoreovj it is stated that &apos;measles&apos; is so prevalent amongst the. Kar stock that a considerable proportion of (he meat would unsaleable.&quot; The factory will therefore have to convert the greaj part of its purchases into meat extract, fertilizer and hie From the evidence the Commission has received, it is imprj able that the factory would be able to piay for the cattle at value the native palaces upon them. The Mkamba considers,)
ON OVERSTOCKING m III Chapter X]the nativo witness stated, that all cattle arc of equal worth, nnd, if he has to rate them as money, he is disposed to regard even the worst starveling as worth the kind of price he knows is being given for working oxen or beef cattle.&quot;2034. We prefer to recommend a fertilizer factory, as indicated the preceding paragraph, and see no reason why it should not ia paying proposition, in the first place, the price paid for an linial would have to be based on its economic value, and would obably amount to a few shillings only. Secondly, there would rtainly be a large and increasing demand for fertilizer products, jiich are now imported to the amount of some 2,500 ions annually, ,d thirdly, the preparation of hides for export should be a profitable idertaking, while incidentally benefiting that industry.2035. While therefore we think no loss should be incurred, we nsider that, if it were, a State subsidy would be amply justified the circumstances; as has been stated, the question is not whe-er the country can afford to have a meat factory, but whether it n afford to be without one. Ou the other hand, it is essential at the interests of the producer should be protected and that he oukl be paid as good a price for his stock as possible. This price oar opinion should depend on the prices realized for fertilizers, lich would have to be fixed at such rates as would enable them secure the whole of the East African market for these types of ttilizer.2036. We recommend something in the nature of a public ility company, over which the State would exercise a considerable asure of control, and that a certain percentage of the profits be dited to the Native Betterment Fund and earmarked exclusivelythe improvement and development of the pastoral areas. Every ility should be given to such a company, but if none can be iuced to establish and operate the necessary factory or factories, a we consider Government itself must step into the breach.2037. Tn the opinion of many witnesses, the damage caused ^e^&apos; the grazing areas by excessive numbers of sheep and goats, th consequent denudation and soil erosion, is greater even than it caused by cattle, and with that opinion we are inclined to to. The problem, however, is a more difficult one, as there uld probably not be a market for the large numbers it would be :e.ssary to cull, and their value to a fertilizer factory would be :y small. A tax would be difficult, if not impossible, to assess or bice, and would be strongly resented by the natives. Sheep and its are, moreover, very necessary as a food supply to the natives, 1 in many areas they do little damage and are the only live stock
fSquatters.Proposed Committee on the Over-stocking Question.Summary,Taut III-Chapter X]ON OVERSTOCKINGwhich thrives. Culling may be necessary in certain locations, bu generally we would recommend that steps be taken to confine then to certain areas, where they are unlikely to cause serious damage.2038. The evidence of Mr. T. J. 0&apos;Shea, a member of Le&quot;is lative Council, on I he subject of squatters and their stock is o interest and worthy of careful study. He has reason to believ there are something like a quarter of a million of native cattle oi European farms in the Nzoia Province alone, and there are probabl at least that number of sheep and goats. The Resident native&apos; Labourers Ordinance, so far as stock is concerned, appears to be ; dead letter ; the numbers kept on the farms are out of all proportioi to the requirements of the natives; a system of &quot;kaffir farming&apos; is prevalent, and the abuse, as Mr. 0&apos;Shca has said, far outweigh any possible benefit. We are in complete agreement with the view: expressed by him, and recommend that a strict limitation of the number of stock which resident labourers are allowed to have r.i the farms should be imposed.2039. We fully realize that the return en masse of all thi excess squatter stock to the reserves would seriously increase tht overstocking problem in them and embarrass the Administration but a policy of limiting the numbers on the farms to the economic requirements of the natives should gradually and steadily be pursued concurrently with that of reducing the numbers of uneconomic stock in the reserves themselves. We do not consider it is a matter which should be left entirely to local opinion.20-10. The measures which are necessary and desirable to coin-bat the evil of overstocking by natives are so many and so vatieel that we&quot; have confined ourselves to certain recommendations c broad lines, and would advise that a Committee be appointed I consider the matter further and in greater detail than we hai found possible in our Report.In brief, our proposals and recommendations are as follows :-(a) That education and propaganda in the economic use of Ianand stock in the native reserves be pressed forward iwidely and intensively as possible.(6) That measures be taken to correlate the stock to the available able grazing in the native areas.(c) That the question of allowing freer movement of stock b relaxation of the quarantine regulations, and the provision of stock routes, be investigated.((7) That the imposition of a stock tax as early as circur. stances permit be considered.

Si1CHAPTER XLTHE FINANCIAL ASPECT OF OUE E ECOMMEND ATION S.e&quot;!11 ditmS of        204JL 0ur recommendations, if carried into effect, will involveP n   ure.    considerable expenditure, which falls under the following heads :___(a) Direct, of which the following are  some of the rnairi items : (1) The purchase of alienated land.(2) Compensation to natives in respect of their rights undersection 88 of the Crown Lauds Ordinance, 1915. 01) Compensation to detribaiized natives in respect of their proposed removal from certain localities in which theyare at present resident. (4) Compensation to certain Dorobo in respect of their proposer)removal.(5) Compensation to the Nandi tribe in respect of certain standpremia which were waived in Kipkaixen and Kaimosi. (6) The fencing of Chematum salt-lick.(7) The upkeep of the supply furrow to the Morania furrow in Meru.(8) Leasing of certain farms for the Kamasia. (9) Eent in respect of the King&apos;s African Eifles lines at Meru. (10) The re-creation of the office of Eecorder of Titles at the Coast.The approximate estimate of the total under these heads is shown in Appendix No. 13, and amounts to  36,000 for capital costs, inclusive of ten years&apos; estimated rent under item S. Nearly  11,500 of the capital amount represents compensation in respect of the removal of natives from Tigoni, Kithirioni, Pangani, ami the land occupied by the Man and Tinet Dorobo, and for the partial evacuation of the settlement at Kibira. The land so eviicu-ated will be an asset in the hands of Government, the disposal of which should more than cover the financial costs of the com-pensation.The figure for recurrent costs under items (8), (7), (9) and (10 is estimated at  1,300.The contingency that at the end of ten years it may become necessary to renew the lease of the Kamasia farms is not taken into account in the above estimate.

Loss of potential revenue (stand premia and its! caused by setting aside further areas for native reserves in i uf opening such land for settlement.2042. The practicability of these recommendations must de-il to some degree on questions of finance; therefore we makefollowing suggestions as to how money for these projects may found and how the cost should be borne.2043. The Kenya Missionary Council, in their memorandum, Peyponsihility stated : &quot; The real responsibility for the errors of the past lies Government :i the Imperial Government, and while many of these errors e committed without any wrong intent, but through ignorance lack of staff and resources, yet a definite obligation of honour upon the Imperial Government to endeavour in every possible to secure either a restitution of alienated land, or, where this so difficult or costly, a granting of other land, or of adequate letary compensation for the injustices clone in the past. It ild be unfair to lay the whole bm-den of this on the local Govern-it. which would mean that the cost would be borne by native non-native alike, and that this generation would have to pay the faults of the past. The local officials were the servants of Imperial Government, and that Government should itself ttlder the responsibility and make proper reparation in every :ed case.&quot;2044. While not endorsing the whole of this criticism of what been done, we think that there is considerable force in the main iment, especially when it is true that many of the purchases payments which we have recommended are occasioned in the n by acts of the Government at a time when the Imperial eminent was directly controlling the finances of the country, and n local non-official opinion was little, if at all, represented in local Government, and that, inasmuch as the need for this -nditure was not recognized when it took over control of the nces, they constituted an undisclosed liability on the Govern-it. We therefore trust that this view of the matter will be given weight and that the Imperial Government will assist in the ision of the funds necessary to implement these particular re-mendations and the cost of this Commission, leaving the local eminent to make good the balance and the loss of potential inue due to the proposals for additions to the reserves.
ON THK FINANCIAL ASPECT part III Chavtkh XI]-Counter-balancing Advantages.Fertilizer Factory.Development Expenditure.Money owing to Carriers of the Military Labour Corps.2045. As a set-off to the expenditure caused by the appointmetl of our Commission and our recommendations, we consider that] the policy we have outlined in connexion with the proper use of tlj land by the natives and markets for their surplus stock be carricj out, their prosperity and that of the country generally wil greatly enhanced, with a consequent improvement in Governmeti revenue.2040. We recommend that every encouragement should given to a company or companies to establish and operate fertilia factories which would obviate the necessity of capital having to found by the Government.But if this be found impracticable, or if it be considered tin such factories should be a Government concern, the finding of t necessary capital would then devolve on Government.2047. We have throughout our Beport laid stress on the nee. sity for the proper utilization of land in the native reserves, a have made recommendations with regard to the need of the in provement of water supplies, fencing, combating of soil erosioi the elimination of tsetse-fly, and the reconditioning and conservi of land, all of which will involve capital and recurrent expenditt which are not included in section 2041 above.204S. We consider that much of the early expenditure could properly met by the allocation to these purposes of the sum of near ,- 50,000 which is owing by the Imperial Exchequer in respect unclaimed balances of pay due to native carriers of the military: Labour Corps, who died or disappeared while employed in ti campaign against German East Africa.2049. The payment of. the debt has repeatedly been urged 1 successive Secretaries of State for the Colonies for a period of twef years, but has been refused by the War Office and the Treasury2050. The whole position is reviewed at length in Despatcl Kenya, No. 83, of the 7th February, 1931, from the Acting Go] ernor of Kenya to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, which emphatically endorsed in Despatch, Uganda Protectorate, No. 1 of the 16th May, 1931, from the Governor of Uganda. We si endeavour to state the position, as it appears to us, as shortly possible.2051. At the outbreak of the Great War, forces had to raised for the defence of Kenya against attacks from German I Africa, and the necessary transport had to be improvised by ti enrolment of native porters.2052. There were neither the men nor the time to provide; proper organization for registering the men enrolled ; it was vii
ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT It iii CuAr-Tiiit XI]It tho porters should be obtained and sent off without delay.   TheJal authorities were ordered to furnish quotas of porters, who e were obliged to serve.2053. In such circumstances, no adequate system for the futureIndication of each individual was possible; moreover, not only e there bound to be many cases of men serving under the same ne. but in several tribes a man may not by tribal custom men-his birth-name.205-1. A similar course was followed until later in the War,fm Lieut.-Colonel Watkins, who was appointed to command the itary Labour Corps, evolved a system of registration.2055. The consequence has been that of a total of over 400,000 lives of Eastern Africa who passed through the books of that some 39,000 are still untraced, as their relatives have not in able to identify the names under which they served, and h of course in most cases ignorant of the numbers under which 1 particular individuals were enrolled.2056. lu 1918, an Ordinance was passed in Kenya with the iroval (except in one particular) of the General Headquarters Ithe East African Campaign, providing, inter alia, that any un-jiied money belonging to a native of the Military Labour Corps fell remained undisposed of should be made over for the benefit lie tribe to which the native belonged. Owing to inadvertence, 1 Ordinance was not submitted to the War Office, and in 1920s repudiated by it on the ground that it was ultra vires for the Legislature to legislate regarding the disposal of Imperial is; this provision of the law had therefore to be repealed.2057. In .the early days of the war in East Africa there was, eeessity, no adequate system of identification, and His Majesty&apos;s eminent was relieved from incurring the expenditure whichIan organization would have necessitated. The War Office later ed to incur expenditure in appointing a special military staff ivestigate the circumstances in which so many natives had ; outstanding to their credit, to find them or their heirs, and to Ithe sums due.   As a result of saving money under these two . the War Office finds itself entitled to retain the money fli had been actually earned by porters, and which should have i paid to them or their heirs.2058. There are three factors of importance in the consideration te question to which we can find no reference in the records ii  with the matter, and to which we wish to invite attention. 20 59. The first is that throughout the war the natives were(e lesrn.1 position of &quot;protected foreigners&quot;, and that they were elled to serve in a war which was in no way caused through
I)latheir action or by local misunderstandings, but which was di European dissensions with which they were not concerned, in winch they had to take part to help in protecting their protectors.2060. Secondly, however much it might be argued th; the early part of the war the natives were helping to protect own country from invasion, this argument could not be said to apphH to the later stages of the war, which took place in (ionium K;,JI Africa in furtherance of Imperial policy ; and it was during thai part of the war that the great bulk of the porters were called ii(:or to serve at the risk of their lives; no such numbers would hi been necessary for the mere defence of Kenya, wdiose natives ham no share or profit in the territory which has been acquired.2061. Thirdly, in support of the payment of unclaimed bal ances of pay being handed over for the benefit of the tribe ti which the individual porter belonged, the analogy of the Regiments Debts Act of 1893 has been invoked. Under that Act, arrears o: pay are applied towards the creation of compassionate funds fo: the benefit of widows or children of soldiers dying on service, etc. it would thus appear that it is felt that special consideration should be given in respect of such matters to the section of the community to wdiich the soldier belongs in preference to the interests of general body of taxpayers, although that section forms a part of t same community and would have pro tunto benefited if the money due had been retained in the national purse. But when money h; been earned, in fighting the battles of another people, by natives tribes in obedience to the orders of their tribal chiefs, the clain of those tribes that the money earned by their tribesmen, who a dead or missing, should be received by them, instead of going the benefit of an exchequer in which they have no share, won seem to be very much stronger than in the case from which tl analogy is taken.2062. The tribes of Kenya have suffered a grievous loss of merU and it would be but bare justice that they should receive the mor these men have earned in obedience to their chiefs.2063. The subject is one on wdiich all sections of the eotr^ munity in Kenya are agreed, whether they be the Governmen settlers, missionaries, officials, Indians or natives, who all ali! feel that a grave injustice would be done if (his claim were ikB fully met.2t)61. Mr. Amery, when Secretary of State for the ColonieB described it as a debt of honour, and we feel confident that : jit British Parliament, as representing the nation, will not accept sit a sacrifice forced upon the natives on the technical financial grour:1:t aON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT Bart III Chapter XI]
570juh the War Office and the Treasury have felt it their duty to t on behalf of the British taxpayer, who has been served so grously and loyally by the native tribes of Kenya.2065. The War Office, while apparently admitting that this ney is due to dead and missing porters, contended that in no ewas the full sum payable, as from it would have to be deducted -jey which had been overpaid to other porters and the pay of era who had deserted. To what extent such overpayments or bilious existed it would be impossible to prove, but in any event uaost improbable that the sums which would be an offset could iimt to the interest which would have been earned on the sum (subject to such deductions) if it had been credited to the native es when it should have been paid, some twelve years ago; the ish Treasury has in effect had the use of the money during period.2006. The position then, as it appears to us in relation to v,!. is that the compulsory labour of thousands of natives has i utilized by the British Government in the main for the. :fit of the Empire, and that the pay earned by thousands of i who died or who were missing in the war has hitherto been ined by the British Government for its own use, and withheld a the relatives and fellow tribesmen of these men, mainly be-i the British Government were saved expenditure in establish-a proper system of registration or of instituting inquiries to retain their heirs and next-of-kin.2067. The benefits of the work of these men are being enjoyed be British Government, and the losses have alb fallen on the :s who sent their fellow tribesmen to the war by order of the :&apos; authorities.2068. We consider that if such treatment were meted out it !1 constitute a much more callous violation of the principles of eeship to the natives than any of the injuries which the natives i suffered by the alienation of their land, which, as we have 3, were due to ignorance of their needs and of their land tenure sns, and were inflicted with a complete absence of any conscious ose of depriving them of what was their due.5069. As regards the main expenditure required for the im- Funds for the siient of pastoral areas, we are of opinion that this might be of*^Pa^r3p by the allocation of a proportion of the revenue of the fertilizer Areas ries for the purpose, but we recognize that this would necessi-a very low price indeed being paid by these factories, for the t dealt with by them.   An alternative to this proposal would special levy on pastoral tribes, the proceeds of which would ntirely expended in carrying out this policy, or, if a stock tax on the financial aspectr [I I CnAPTKR XI]
ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT Part III Chapter XI]Communal Labour in Reserves.were found to be the most practicable proposition, a propbrtiu thereof might be devoted to the purpose.   We are satisfied UiJ whichever of these alternatives be finally adopled, if the money &apos; wisely spent, the position of the pastoral natives and of the count] generally vviil be very materially improved.2070. Much of the work required for the reconditioning pastime fund, the reclamation of liy areas by the cutting down bush, for the drainage of swamps and construction of dams, in fal for any such work which would be of.direct benefit to the nativl themselves, should, in our opinion, be carried out by means communal labour, especially where the land is communally heij thus saving considerable expenditure.2071. There are hundreds of square miles in reserves wiie stock are frequently on the verge of starvation for lack of grazinl which are covered with bush and which if cleared would becorj excellent pasture land.2072. In these reserves the natives complain of the lack I land for grazing, and ask for more, whereas they have that lrJ in them present reserve if they would only clear the bush. Thl able-bodied youths and men live for the most part a life of idlenel and are prevented by Government from indulging in their maj form of manly exercise raiding and fighting; they are unlike] for years to come to appreciate how they could improve position as stock owners by work of this kind; so that it is uhlikJ that their Local Native Councils will pass such resolutions as id been passed in other districts, as mentioned by Lord Moyi paragraph 90 of his Report with regard to normal civic obliga It would, moreover, seem doubtful whether such work would col under the provisions of Article 2 (tf) of the International Convent concerning forced and compulsory labour, unless and until &quot;a e of emergency&quot;, arises;  in  our opinion,  calamity is ultimatj threatened by these increasing invasions of insect (fly) and ven able pests (increase of bush), but cases of emergency in this cJ flexion would never arise if such work could be ordered to be do a 2073. It seems that the natives in these areas, owing to) decrees of European Governments, directed towards the prevent of compulsory labour by natives for others, are likely to find the .;. selves in that unfortunate position described by the Prince of Wa in a recent speech : &quot; It is hard enough to be out of a job, bul ..&apos; is far worse not to be fit enough through enforced idleness to ti up a job when given the opportunity.&quot;It is true that in this case the lack of a job and the enfon idleness is in part due to the disinclination of such natives work, and it is submitted that it is to their undoubted moral
ON THE FINANCIAL ASPECT , 11I Chapter XI]jical interests that they should be required, for a few months [jeh year, under proper safeguards, to do work for their owd erial benefit, rather than that they should be permitted to de-erate, as they undoubtedly will, if they are permitted to live a of idleness.We suggest that if the words &quot;in cases of emergency&quot; in the re-mentioned Article are held to prevent reclamation work of kind, steps be taken to delete them, and that the scope of the lie might with advantage be somewhat widened to embrace-:r work for the benefit of the natives themselves.2074. The above remarks apply not only to the pastoral, but to some extent to some of the semi-pastoral and agricultural:s.That such a course would have i ?al results in increasing the ; available for native use may be gathered from Appendix 11, riiich it is shown that a thousand natives, working for a year ler supervision, should be able to clear 50,000 acres of land.
CHAPTER XIT.Purpose of tho Chapter.The Terms of Reference.The Future Needs ot Tribes.SUMMARY OP RECOMMENDATIONS.2075. We shall conclude our Report by a brief survey of problems referred to us and the manner in which we have templed to deal with them. Although the chapter will contai summary of our conclusions, we wish to be concise, even at soini sacrifice of accuracy. In the course of the Report it has sometime] been necessary to discuss minor, but difficult, problems in ineticJ lous detail, wdiile relatively more important problems have occupiel less space. A survey of the kind which we now contemplate inaf be of assistance in restoring a proper perspective and enabling thl recommendations to be regarded as a whole. But we take precaution of stating that the very much abbreviated version \vl will be given of the recommendations in summary form tin;-! be accepted as anything but a description in outline, and in no wj qualifies the authentic recommendations which appear in the body of the Report.21)70. It is clear, both from the terms of reference and omen wise, that your Commission was appointed with two prineipi objects in view : that we should make recommendations for satisfied] ing the needs of natives in respect of land, and that we shoal propose a settlement for certain doubtful questions of right.The first, and perhaps the most difficult, question to which J directed our attention was how we should deal with the first ten! of reference, in which we were asked to &quot;consider the needs of H native population, present and prospective, in respect of land&quot;. (J what basis should we determine future needs?2077. It will be appreciated that there has been great difficult in determining what land is necessary for the future needs of nati tribes.   If a population is increasing it is hard to set any limit the land which it may ultimately need.   At the present stage development the natives have, for the most part, to be regan tribally, and it is necessary that land should be reserved to tribe sufficient for its needs in the present and the near future, beyond that point the necessity is not so much that land slio be reserved as that there should be a facility by which tribes individuals could obtain more land, if it is needed.

With these considerations in mind we made a prelim- of &quot;Native&quot; ;ry classification of native areas.   Our first class of land, which Areas. !called Class A, was to comprise the present native reserves gther with the additions to be made on grounds of right.  These :recommend to be &quot;Native Lands&quot;.Our second class of land was to comprise the land which we nhl recommend to be added on economic grounds. These we iled to call Class Bl, or &quot;Native Reserves&apos;&apos;, if the need to be [filled appeared to be of an enduring character, and Class B2, orjiporary Native Reserves&quot;, if the need appeared to be of a ire temporary kind.j)70. We decided also that it would be necessary to provide which might be held by natives on a more private form of rare than is at present possible in the native reserves, and we ref ore proposed the provision of Class C land, or &quot;Native Lease-Id Areas&quot;.2080. We also decided to recommend that there should be compulsory Class D, in which no special privilege of race should obtain respect either of initial grants or transfers. Such land would in ;ct lie. all the land in the country, which is neither existing native -reserve, nor A, B, or C, nor European Highlands, nor an area, .li as Turkana, in which certain tribes have special, though not elusive, rights.-2081. We considered that by such an arrangement we should able fo provide for the needs of natives, both on tribal and lividual lines, and to propose safeguards which would create a Sictent security, while at the same time preserving a reasonablesticity.2D82. With this general plan in mind, but leaving the precise hire of the safeguards for subsequent consideration in a later Age of the Report, we first addressed ourselves to the tribal pect of the matter, and for the first two parts of the Report
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part Hi Chapter XII]the satisfaction of Tribal Rights.Estimate of Tribal Needs.confined ourselves principally to the task of deciding (a) what h the several tribes could claim on historical grounds, and (6) w] hind is necessary to them for the present or for such future reqtii menbs as can be clearly foreseen.2083. In so far as tribal claims of right are concerned, have made a detailed examination in each case and have m: recommendations for a final settlement.2084. The total additions which we have recommended to be made to tribal territory in satisfaction of such claims amount (oni balance, after allowing for exchanges) to approximately 1,474 square! miles, or 3 per cent of the present total area of the native reserves.2085. In order to reach an estimate of the needs of the various tribes in respect of land, we took evidence regarding the quality of the land at the disposal of each tribe and regarding the habits ami degree of advancement of the people. We found that the reserves, taken as a whole, should easily be able to support the total native population which lives in them, the general density being 53 to the square mile.   But there is a very uneven distribution.2086. We found that in the three Kikuyu districts some degree of local congestion exists, but no general congestion; that it could to a large measure be relieved by the practice of better methods of agriculture and animal husbandry, and by modifications in the system of land tenure designed to promote a greater fluidity oi distribution ; but that the learning of these lessons would neces-sarily be a slow process, and that an addition of land was required in order to reduce the pressure of population on the land until sueb time as the Kikuyu should have attained greater skill in agriculture and the conduct of social life, such as would render the land capable of supporting a larger population in a greater degree of material comfort. We have therefore recommended, a substantial addition to the Kikuyu Reserve.2087. The case of the Teita is somewhat similar, and for then also we have recommended an extension on economic grounds. Biri among the agricultural tribes generally, and especially the Kavir ondo, we found that the land is being so unskilfully used that ever a moderately successful programme of education in agricultural ant pastoral practice should suffice to raise the standard of life pro gressively for many years, even though the population is increasing20S8. Claims for extension of territory were advanced by rnos tribes on the ground that they have not enough pasture land foi their cattle. In some few cases, for instance those of the Taveti and the Elgeyo and to a less extent the Kamba of Machakos dis (district, we have found the claim to be justified in the sense that thi land which the tribe has at its command is not sufficient, unless i
573summary of recommendations iii CnAPWsn xii]johible improvement in methods of stock-farming takes place, to Lable it to keep the number of cattle which it may reasonably . thought to require. In these cases we have recommended Jdiiions of land on economic grounds.But in most cases for instance, those of the Suk and the pups the truth of the matter is that the tribe concerned, by juton accumulation of unmarketable live stock far in excess of its ;dissapointed, has produced such devastation by overstocking that, unless juditions are drastically changed, the ruination of &quot;these reserves is , sight. In such cases, the only real remedy is to strike at the ,;: of the evil and reduce the number of live stock, and we have litton a special chapter stating the lines on which, in our opinion, lion ought, to be taken. In the confidence that these measures 31 be taken, we have recommended certain additions of grazing ids in order that they may be used as resting grounds in con-sion with an organized plan of regenerating the reserves.2089. The sum total of the additions which we have recom-ended to be made on grounds of economic need are 896 square ies as Class Bl and 259 square miles as Class B2. The total Uitions which we have recommended to be made to native areas, tether as Class A. B, or C, are 2,629 square miles, or an increase 5.1 per cent of the present total area of the native reserves.2090. The specific recommendations which we have made for Recommende various tribes may be summarized shortly. tions byTribes.2091. Most of the alienations of which complaint is made by Kikuvn. i Kikuyu took place in or on the borders of what is now the ianibu district. Our examination of the facts has justified the inclusion that this district was only sparsely occupied at that time far as any visible occupation was concerned, and it was natural at Government should have taken the view that there was much isle land which could be alienated without detriment to the lives:2092. But the alienations increased the density of the native pnlation in the Kikuyu Reserve, not only by restricting the area, t also in other ways.&quot; They were part of the policy of white ttlement which resulted in the establishment of a considerable m and market at Nairobi, which has drawn population in that tection, and problems of local congestion are arising in the reserve itch threaten to become acute in the next generation.2093. In all the circumstances we decided that it would be a it settlement with the Kikuyu tribe if we should first make an sessment on the lines of a &quot;profit and loss&quot; account, showing the
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part III-Chapter XII]extent of their true losses of territory and give them cbmpehsa tion by an addition of an equivalent area to rank as &quot;Native Lands&quot; and should then add another area as Native Reserve, Class B:, to satisfy their economic needs.2094. For the purposes of striking the balance we assumed that the following areas had already been added to the reserve :  The Mwea Area. 205 square miles, the addition of which hadalready been approved by the Governor in  Council h1928, and which had been used as native reserve evesince, though never so gazetted. L.O. 4450. 0.69 square miles, which had been used by nativewith the permission of Government for a number of years L.O. 388/1. 0.62 square miles, surrendered by the Africa. Inland Mission at Kijabe in 1930 to satisfy native claims.2095. By an exhaustive examination of the evidence and re cords we reached a conclusion on the position of the old Kikuyii boundaries in 1895, and the extent of the area which might be held to have been &quot;admissibly acquired&quot; since that date, and linalh concluded that a further balance of 16,520 acres was due to tht Kikuyu tribe to be added as &quot;Native Lands&quot;.   We then added 11 further 2,000 acres as general compensation for disturbance; m further 1,000 acres in connexion with the admission to the reserve! of certain Dorobo now resident in the forest reserve; and a fun he! 1,522 acres as a provision for the Kithirioni and Tigoni exchanges! We knocked off the odd amount of 42 acres, and made the result! round figure of 21,000 acres.2096. We then made recommendations at section 466, as iM how the necessary land might be found.   The bulk of it is froirj forest reserve ; 2,000 acres are by voluntary surrender of mission] land ; and there are four cases where the acquisition of private land&apos; either by exchange or purchase, is recommended.

The recommendations in regard to the Tigoni exchange, jy which the natives would be moved from Tigoni on favourable grins and Tigoni would be at the disposal of the Crown, are to be ound at section 394 of the Report.2098. In settlement of the claim of the Kikuyu to more land &quot;^t^oHtoe [he ground of economic needs, we have recommended, at section Kikuyu Claim I1 that 383 square miles of the northern part of the Yatta be co Land on dried to the Kikuyu tribal area as Native Reserve, Class Bl.

A point arose at to whether the settlement of tribal The Kikuyu trims as a whole could equitably be held to comprise a settlement from^the^-Jrith every member of the tribe, or whether individuals should still Point of View sable to claim rights outside the tribal boundaries, on the strength Qjajm&apos;j1Vil^e githaka rights or claims to protection under section 80 of the Irown Lands Ordinance.  We reviewed the matter in considerable jetail in Chapters VII to IX of Part I. Our recommendation, given section 367, was to the effect that in consideration of a sum of ! 000 to be paid to the Local Native Councils for distribution to Jie persons affected, and in consideration of the block addition &apos; two thousand acres which we had recommended to be added to lie tribal territory in general compensation for disturbance and in pisideration of the general settlement with the tribe, both in spect of its rights and its economic needs, all private rights of bkuyu to land outside the Kikuyu Native Reserve should be Istinguished, except (a) such rights, if any, as may be held upon (tie and (b) such rights as may have been acquired in another lative reserve, e.g. as a muhoi or tenant under the system of land lenure obtaining.2100.

We have recommended that the addition be made.At section 569 we have made a recommendation that Govern-ent should meet the full charges in connexion with the supply-trrow to the Morania furrow, both in respect of actual cost and Hpaintenance.At section 570, we recommend that the Meru should be allowed negotiate for the purchase of L.O. 4634, if the lessee is willing sell.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part III Chatter XII]The Land Problems of the Masai.At section 5r2, we recommend that the Somalis should evacii-ate the land which they now occupy in the Meru Native Reserve.At section 573, we recommend that the question of the boun-dary of the native, reserve forest reserve be reconsidered.At section 576, we recommend that the King&apos;s African Rifles should pay rent for the land which they occupy in the Meru Native Reserve.2101. In Chapter I of Part II we review the circumstances which led to the Masai Agreements of 1904 and 1911, and consider the effect of those agreements.At section 671, we recommend that, in so far as our proposals in Part III of the Report respecting the Lands Trust Ordinance are acceptetl by Government, they should be equally applicable to all tribes, and that there is no need for special clauses for the Masai.At section 677 we have recorded our finding to the effect that the Masai have no claim of right either to the Mile Zone or the Chyulu Triangle. At section 681. we recommend that the Masai should be given an opportunity of taking out annual leases at a reasonable rent, such lenses to be renewable until such time as equivalent watering facilities are made available in the adjoining parts of the Masai Native Reserve. At section 1963 in Part HI of the Report we recommend that, this temporary facility to the Masai notwithstanding, the status of the Mile Zone should be European Highlands.At section 684, following a decision of the Governor in Council, we have recommended that the area known as the Quarter Mile! Zone along the Magadi Railway, be included in the Masai Native Reserve.At section 691 we have recorded our finding that those parts of farms L.O. 193, 196 and 197 which are south of the Mbagathi River are at present in the Masai Native Reserve, and we have recommended that the Masai Local Native Council should receive the amount which was paid to Government for the purchase of the land.At section 695, we have recommended that the Masai should receive an area of the total extent of 14.06S acres, most of which is valuable grazing land on the southern extremity of the Eastern Man Forest Reserve, in exchange for an area, of 13,245 acres of forest which would become forest reserve. The area which the Masai would receive contains a tongue of forest land, about 1,216 acres in extent, in which there is valuable cedar. We have recom-mended that it should become native forest reserve.
575SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part III Chapter XII]At section 690, following a recommendation of the Giovernor ui Council which has already taken effect, we have recommended lliat the gift to the Masai of 118 square miles in the Kedong Valley iii return for the Kinangop circumcision area should be regularized by the addition of the area to the Masai Native Reserve.At section 697, we have recommended that a portion of L.O. 110/1 be exchanged for an equivalent portion of adjacent native reserve with a view to giving the Masai a more convenient access :o the river Marmonet.At section 698, we have discussed the advisability of certain exchanges or leases which are illustrated in the map at section 700 of the Report. One of these exchanges is already in operation as i temporary arrangement between the Masai and the Kikuyu, by rhich the Masai have the use of a part of the Ndeiya location of Kikuyu in return for an equivalent area near the Einbakasi forest reserve. The area involved on each side is believed to be approxi-mately ten square miles, and we have recommended mutual leases.It is particularly important that, if possible, Government should secure, by lease or exchange, the area marked E on the nap in order that it may be used as a native leasehold area. We have shown it as such in the schedule at section 1879, and have made clear, at section 620, the advantages of securing such an uea in reasonable proximity to Nairobi.At sections 712 and 713 we consider the possibility of future exchanges.2102. The facilities which we have recommended for the The Claims of Kamba tribe comprise (i) the addition of approximately 300 square T1!;ix^amba uiles of the Yatta Plateau; (ii) an advantageous exchange by riiich the tribe would give up the Kikumbuliu location of 3S9 square miles south of the railway and receive an area of approxi-rattely 512 square miles north of the railway between Emali and Makindu ; (iii) the addition of 700 acres at Mwani hill; and (iv) ibout three square miles in the neighbourhood of Emali station. The first of these items is recommended as Class B 1, and the remainder as Class A. The section references are 759, 776, 779, 183, and the position of the land involved is shown on the coloured nap following this chapter.Becommendations of a minor kind include a proposed exchange if twenty acres in the neighbourhood of Alomandu (section 774) md a proposal that, if ever Ngaleni farm (L.O. 4969; 100 acres) :omes into the market, the Kamba should be allowed to bid for it section 772); and a proposal that Government should negotiate rith the Church of Scotland Mission for a corridor of access to lonnect the Mbuinzao block with the main reserve (section 789).
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part HI Chapter XII]Native Rights in the Northern Frontier anrl Turkana Provinces.TheJlukogodo, the Ndigiri, the Ilimwesi and the Mumonyot Masai.Claims of the West Suk.The Uasin Gishu MasnThe Pokwot (Fast Suk).At section 782 we have recommended that an area of approxi-mately 100 square miles eastward of Eniali in the general position shown on the map (at section 796) should remain at the disposal of the Crown, since we consider that this area may be required in connexion with the establishment of a blood and bone fertilizer factory.At section 793 we have recommended that a mistake which occurred in the gazettement of the Kitui district boundary be rectified. This will add sixty square miles to the Kitui Native Reserve as at present gazetted.2103. We have recommended that except for the West Suk and North Pokomo reserves there should be no native reserves in the Northern Frontier and Turkana Provinces; the land, except in these two reserves, should not be regarded as wholly devoted to native purposes; but it should be recognized as land in which natives have a prior interest; leases to non-natives should not be allowed to such an extent as to justify the apprehension that the natives might not have sufficient land remaining for their use. The above recommendation should apply generally to the Leroki Plateau as well as to other parts of these provinces, at least for many years to come, but leases of large areas to non-natives on the Leroki Plateau should not be allowed except for purposes directly beneficial to natives (sections 805-807).210-1. We have recommended that the Mukogodo area should be detached from the Kikuyu Province and added to the Northern Frontier Province for purposes of land administration, and that the Provincial Commissioner should make arrangements lor the provision of sufficient land for the Mukogodo, the Ndigiri, the Ilimwesi and the Mumonyot Masai (section 810).2105. We have not thought it necessary to recommend any land to be given to the West Suk in addition to the land of which they now have the use. A proposal was put forward for our con-sideration to the effect that, by an adjustment of the inter-colonial boundary, the districts of Turkana and West Suk in Kenya and Karamoja in Uganda should be included under one administration. We regarded this matter as outside our terms of reference, but remarked that it appears to merit serious consideration (sections 909-913).2106. At section 923 we recommend that the Uasin Gishu Masai should leave their present area and be accommodated in the Trans-Mara region of the Masai Native Reserve.2107. At section 939 we have recommended that the Pokwot should have Churo as a provisional native reserve (Class B 2) and that the area of the extension should be between 130 and 150 square miles.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS ,B1 HI-Chapter XII]2108. We have recommended an extension amounting al-irether to 100 square miles to be added to the reserve as Class 13 1. ieciions 942 and 969.)As further facilities for the Kamasia we have recommended i (hat they should be given approximately 71 square miles of the ml evacuated by the Uasin Gishu Masai as native reserve ClassI and that the balance of some five square miles round EldalatII should be forest reserve; (ii) that Government should lease for ;em certain alienated farms comprising twenty-three square ;ies; (iii) that L.O. 1168 (920 acres) and a further area of 960 res to the east of Lembus forest should be given to them as tive land Class A.  (Sec sections 967, 968, 970 and 971.)2109. At section 977, in agreement with the findings of the lecial committee appointed in 1929 to report upon the Dorobo oblem, we have recommended that as a general rule, Dorobo on id be moved into the reserves of those native tribes with lich they have the most affinity. But in regard to the Man ;tion we have recommended at section 979 that they should be nsuited as to whether they would prefer to go to the Chepahmgu i he added as part of the Dumbwa Native Deserve) or into other native reserve.2110. The facilities which  we have recommended for the The Elgeyo. ffeyo, Cherangani and Marakwet comprise : (i) an advantageous Cherangani change by which the Elgeyo give up 4,933 acres of forest or and Marakwot rub in return for 4,977 acres containing a large proportion of sture land ; (ii) the addition to the reserve as Class B 1 of D.O. 69 and also of certain unalienated land in the Cherangani farm :a, the total extent of the relief afforded being, on balance. 16?,-lare miles (see sections 100S, 1009, and 1020).2111. At section 1066 we recommended a payment of  o.0()0 The Nandi. the Nandi as an estimated equivalent of the true loss sustained them by reason of circumstances connected with the alienation the Kipkarren and Kaimosi farms, particularly in connexion (h the waiving of stand premia.At section 1068 we have recommended a modification of the gle Line which would have the effect of restoring three square les to native use together with valuable salt licks. We have led a recommendation that when the boundary of the Kipkarren ins has been amended in this way, the unalienated land inside should be available for alienation to Europeans.21.12. Our recommendations regarding the El Gonyi are stated The El Gonyi. section 10S7, and are to the effect that (i) they should be moved sit the alienated farms, compensation being paid to those natives ohave resided there continuously for three years or more, and thatThe Njemii&quot; and the Kamasin.Accommodation for the Dorobo.

Besides the addition of the 40,000 acres just mentioned the following facilities have been recommended for the Kavirondo Native Beserve.At section 1118 we noted tho intention of Government to add] to the reserve 1,380 acres which now form part of the Kistnmjj Township, and we recommended that it be implemented, rentark-ing that in our opinion the natives will have been treated not only I fairly but generously.At section  1127 we have recommended  that 900 acres at] Maseno, at present in use as a social service centre but excluded j from the reserve, be no longer excluded but become a social service centre in the reserve.At section 1136 we have made a proposal that, if ever the I farm L.O. 653 comes into the market, the natives should be allowed! to bid for it, either tribally or privately.A special chapter (No. 13 of Bart II) has been devoted to the! question of mining leases in the Kakamega area.2114. At section 1176 we recommended that approximately! 14811 square miles of the area known as Chepalungu be added to thej Lumbwa Native Reserve as native land Class A, but that Govern-ment should reserve in it such locations as it may consider advisable] for the use of the Dorobo who are moved into Chepalungu front] the Mau area.At section 1153 we recommend that the Lumbwa should have the use of the Chematum salt-lick and that Government should erect and maintain a fence along the road of access out of general revenue.At section 1180 we recommend that the Lumbwa should have] access to the Kibeit Bitein salt-lick for the purpose of removing] salt but should not have rights to take their stock there.At section 1183 we &apos; have recommended that an area not I exceeding two square miles should be set apart at Chemagel foi township, but should not be excluded from the native reserve.2115. At section 1203 we have stated the facts concerning thej Duruma claim to the Mwachi Valley in so far as they arc known j
577SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS toAnT III-Chapter XII]i,0 us. But certain evidence coming to hand at the last moment laused a doubt as to whether we have, even now, all the factslefore us. We therefore decided to make no recommendation, txeept that a special inquiry should be undertaken, preferably bylie Provincial Commissioner.At section 1213 we have recommended an exchange in thellwachi forest area involving approximately 2,000 acres on each !j,le. The chief advantage to the natives is that they will have a tjearly defined boundary which will include two lcayas or sacredlaces in the reserve.2116. We have recommended additions to the Taveta Nativeteserve of 22.J square miles as Class B 1.   We have also recom-lended that the Local Native Council should be allowed to opentei&apos;negotiations for the purchase of L.R. 1881 from Messrs. Sedgwiek Goodwillie (sir sections 1229-1231).2117. In order to satisfy a claim of right by the Teita tribe have   recommended   that   Government   purchase   L.O.   921 mdanyi Estate and  that it be added to the Dabida Native Reserve as native land, Class A.   The section reference is 1255.We have also recommended that negotiations be opened with jae Teita Concessions, Limited for the surrender of two areas, -respectively three square miles and eleven square miles in extent, thereabouts, in satisfaction of rights held respectively by the captaine and the Kasigao, these areas being, in our opinion, subject fo native rights and deemed to be excluded from the lease as pro-in section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance.   With the Iddition of these areas to the reserve, the residue of the estate fhould pass unencumbered to the lessees, who, under section 31 if the 1902 ordinance would be entitled to a reduction of i-ent. see sections 1259-1271.)We have made further rec-recommendations at sections 1273 and i5, by which additional land amounting to 65 square miles wouldIe added to the native reserve as native lands, Class A and 119 pare miles would be added as temporary native reserve, Class 2. These areas would be added from adjacent unalienated CrownIind, and we have recommended that, if the Teita are successful it clearing the temporary area of tsetse fly, they should have it as istive reserve, Class B 1.At section 12S0 we have recommended a very minor adjust-eut of the boundary near Voi River bridge. 2118. At section 1286 we have recommended that, if con-tidered desirable, the Sagalla natives should be given permission to cultivate on Maungu hill on temporary lease or licence.  At section the Claims ol the Taveta.The Claims of the Teita and the Kasigao.The SagallaNativeReserve.we propose a small adjustment of boundary, duo to the fact the Voi River having altered its course.

At section 1293 we have recommended that the nativeStrip. reserves on the coastal strip should not be extended without very good reason; but we have found good reason to exist for giving 600 acres, now used as commonage, to the Pungu-Mzichenda Native Reserve (section 1296).2120. At section 1297 we have recommended that the land occupied by the Galla between the Tana River and the Kitui Native Reserve should be treated on the same footing as we have recom-tnended for the Northern Prontier Province and Turkana.Native^ands. 2121. It seemed to us that the Lands Trust Ordinance, byreserving particular lands for the use and benefit of particular tribes &quot;for ever&quot;, had introduced a rigidity into the land system which might be extremely detrimental to future progress. While fully appreciating the need for security we decided that greater elasticity ought to be introduced.2122. In our opinion the present system of a large number of comparatively small reserves had little to commend it. There appeared, for instance, to be no reason why the land of the homo-geneous Kikuyu tribe should be divided artificially into three units. We considered that peaceful interpenetration would be facilitated and a more economic distribution of the population would ultimately be secured if the tribal units were larger. We therefore recom-mended only nine maiu units of native lands, as set out in the table following section 1510 of the Report.Degrees of^ 2123. It was also in the interests of elasticity that we madeDifferent 0l ^ne classification of lands into A, B 1, B 2, etc. It seemed to us Classes of absurd that land added to tribal territory for the fulfilment of an Land- economic need should be added &quot;for ever&quot;, although there is no guarantee that the need will be permanent. We therefore deter-mined that a different degree of security was necessary for each class.The Security 2121. At section 1639 we have recommended that Native Landsof Native should cease to be Crown land, but should be vested in a trust.Areas. .    &apos;and be subject to the sovereignty of the Crown and its rights tominerals, forests, water, and general power of control.The conditions oil which exclusions may take place are covered in sections 1518 and 1521.2125. The security proposed for Native Reserves (Bl) is that they should be Crown lands under the protection of the Lands Trust Board. They could not be diminished or taken away without the consent of the Lands Trust Board, excepting only that an appeal should lie to the Secretary of State (section 1459).   &quot;Temporary

The recommendations hitherto reviewed in this sum-mary have concerned themselves mainly with matters affecting the tribal boundaries, either in respect of extensions, or exchanges or srfeguards. We now turn to the recommendations affecting the tenure of land inside the boundaries :Such questions are of two kinds : tenure of land as between ative and native, and questions affecting the acquisition of land j[or purposes of social service, trade, or industry.2127. On the question of tenure of land by natives we have recommended, at sections 1639 and 1796, that the rights of particu-lar tribes, groups, families and individuals should be covered by a leclaration that they shall have all the rights and powers in respect of land which they have under native law and custom, as it is or as it may become, in so far as they are not repugnant to the Lands Trust Ordinance or rules under it, or any other law or ordinance of the Colony.2128. At section 1653 we have discussed the point whether the lystem of land tenure should depend entirely on native custom, or adiether it should be capable of modification by rule.   We haveIrecommended, at section 1655, that Government must take and rse the power to make rules. At section 1657 we recommended a irocedure which would ensure that no rules would be made without rolonged deliberation or without consultation of the natives.2129.   In Chapter III of Part III we have. discussed exhaust-Ively the methods which we recommend for the acquisition of plots or the purposes of social service, trade or industry. The chapter !oes not lend itself to compression in the form of a summary.2130. At section 1544 we recommend that in the creation and evelopment of townships in native reserves, the basic principle would be that they should remain in the reserve and grow pro-jessively out of plots set apart as need arises.At section 1551 we recorded our opinion that in the cases of ort Hall and Kakamega townships there are certain right-holders ) whom compensation is due; we also recorded our opinion that fiese cases are exceptional and that there are no other existing ewnships in native reserves in respect of which any compensation due to private right-holders.2131. Our general recommendations in regard to mining leases nd other matters relating to mining are to be found at sections 1)58-1594.  But in the particular case of Kakamega we have made Social proposals at section 1146 et scq.Questions ofInternalTenure.Tenure of Land by Natives.The Method of regulating the System of Land Tenure.The Acquisi-tion of Plots for purposes of Social Service, Trade or Industry.Townships inNativeReserves.Alining Leases.

Our recommendations in regard to water rights are at sections 1595-1606; in regard to roads and railways at sections 1607-1617: and in regard to native reserve forests tlicv are at sections 1618-1622.2133. Turning from the subject of land tenure to the allied subject of the utilization of land we wish to invite especial attention to the recommendations at section 2040 of the Report in which we state the measures necessary to safeguard the native areas from deterioration through overstocking.2134. At section 1691 we have recommended that, while the function of the Lands Trust Board is to protect, the responsibility for the management, development, administration and control of native lands rests directty with Government.At section 1697, after reviewing the duties of the Board, and stating the comparative advantages and disadvantages of a Board resident in England and a Board in Kenya, wc have expressed a preference for the former, for reasons stated in the section.2135. We have devoted a special chapter (Chapter VI of Part III) to a review of the workings of the Lands Trust Ordinance. We have recommended a reconstruction of the ordinance on lines which will constitute the Lands Trust Board essentially a protector, while the task of internal control and development would belontr unequivocally to Government. We have also recommended that the existence of private rights should be kept more closely in mind. We found in the present ordinance too pronounced a tendency to regard the native reserves as a common.2136. That concludes our summary of those parts of the Report which deal with tribal areas. We now turn to the recom-mendations concerning facilities for natives outside the tribal areas.2137. In Chapter XVII of Part I and Chapter VI of Part II we have examiued certain special problems of Nairobi and Mombasa respectively. Our specific recommendations will be found in the following sections : at section 591, regarding Pangani native village; at sections 593, 594, regarding Pumwani native quarter at 601-608 regarding Kibira Sudanese settlement; at 631, regarding the Somalis on Nairobi commonage; and at 1363 regarding Mombasa housing scheme.2138. At section 623 wfe make a recommendation of a more general application.. It is to the effect that,- when a native is returned to his reserve from an urban area, either as a vagrant or under any lawful order, the District Commissioner of his own reserve must have powet to find accommodation for him; the rules
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS p.fit  &quot;ill Chapter XII]10f land tenure must not be such as to preclude such a native from obtaining accommodation at least as a tenant, and receiving a (sufficiency of land to cultivate.2139. At section 1879 we have given a schedule of the lands ^olclAr^ease&apos; Iffhich we recommend to be native leasehold areas.   Their total     &apos; lareu is 939 square miles.At section 1880 we recommend that every such area should beIunder the supervision and control of the Provincial Commissioner in fdiose province it is situated, and that he should deal with it through an advisory body constituted ou the lines of a Local Land Board [in a native reserve.Sections 1882-1935 contain our proposals for the method of Iteuure of land in native leasehold areas.-2110.   At section 1S54, we have recommended in effect that, Section 86 ofIprovided that our proposals for extensions of native reserves are i1!Jn^rown accepted, aud provided that compensation in other forms is paid Ordinance, in cases in which we have recommended it (e.g. the recommendationIat section 1087 regarding the Elgonyi), then steps should be taken to render section 86 of the Crowm Lands Ordinance, 1915, and vtion 31 of the Crown Lands Ordinance. 1902, inoperative both [in existing aud future leases; provided that the recommendation [should not apply to land in the Coast strip.In this connexion we have recommended, at section 1858, that Ian i irder in Council be sought.2111. Section 1970 states the manner in which we have arrived The European at a definition of&quot; the European Highlands; in section 1971, the H,Khland3-area is stated to be approximately 16,700 square miles, as shown total the map following section 1976. In section 1979 we recommend that the boundaries of the European Highlands he safeguarded by Inn Order in Council.2142. Although the matter is not strictly within our terms of Proposals for erence, we supported, at section 632, a proposal by the Game Game Park. [Warden that the greater part of the Nairobi Commonage should Become a national game park, and we stated that, in our opinion, would be in the best interests of the Colony that the land should e devoted to this purpose.  In regard to a further proposal by the ianie Warden that there be a national game park near Mount llarsabit, we stated, at section 817, that we saw no objection to it, provided that adequate safeguards are introduced for limiting the number of animals to a point at which there is no danger of their pausing impairment to the land.2143. We invite attention to the financial recommendations t^recommend-hich we have made in the previous chapter. tions.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS Part 11I Chapter XI1JRecommenda- 2144. Before closing our Report, we wish to make a finalan Order hr8 recommendation. In regard to all claims based on an allegation of Council. right, the public of Kenya, both native and non-native, is looking to us for recommendations which will secure finality. These we have striven to provide, and wo hope that, if our recommendations in this regard are accepted by Government, steps will be taken to ensure that these claims will not again bo reopened. We consider that no other safeguard could be so effective as an Order in Council. We arc not concerned to propose what form it should take, but the effect should be that, subject to the special exceptions and qualifica-tions contained in our recommendation at section 1S54 above, all native rights outside the reserves should now bo expunged in view of the additions made to tribal territory and the other forms of compensation provided.2145. It must not be thought that this proposal is made with any intention of preventing the natives from obtaining rights in land outside the reserves. On the contrary, the recommendations made in the Report concerning native leasehold areas and areas in which all races should have equal privileges in respect of land will provide the natives with far more facilities for acquiring land out-side their reserves than they have ever had before. But it is to the advantage of nobody that the present precarious occupancy, rest-ing on unasccrtainable claims of right or the protection of section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance, should continue. We recommend that the slate be cleaned by an expunging of these nebulous rights, and afterwards natives will have ample opportunity to take up land on lease in native leasehold areas should they prefer that course to living in the reserves.2146. The essential point is that there should be no hang-over of further claims in the areas for which we have recommended a settlement on tribal lines. Areas such as the Kenya Protectorate are exceptional, and are excluded from the scope of our reconr mendation.2147. In the satisfaction of economic needs finality is not, it the nature of tho subject, procurable. But we have proposed i general framework for a land system which provides, in our opinion both sufficient security and sufficient elasticity. This framework, i accepted by Government, would be embodied in a reconstitute Native Lands Trust Ordinance. We recommend that the Ordinanc itself be safeguarded by Order in Council ; not as to all its clause; but in all cardinal matters.2148. We recommend that the boundaries of the nine mai units of native lands which we have recommended be defined b the Order in Council; and that the clauses in the Lands Trufl
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS &quot;art III-Chapter XII]Ordinance which lay down how additions, exclusions or exchanges may be made should be safeguarded against amendment, unless by i now Order in Council.2149. We recommend that the protection of the Order in Council should also be extended to native leasehold areas in respect if their external boundaries.2150. We further recommend that the clauses which define he constitution and powers of the Lands Trust Board be similarlyirotected.2151. We further recommend that the Order in Council should ontain a declaration regarding the private rights of natives in the escrves on the lines suggested in section 1796 above.2152. We consider that it would be invidious if the native eserves were to be protected in this manner and no similar security ie given to the European Highlands. We recommend therefore hat the external boundaries of the European Highlands be defined inder the Order in Council, and be subject to analogous safeguards j to exclusions, additions and exchanges.W.

APPENDIX IExtracts from Documents and Evidence Relating to the Question of the Extent of Kikuyu Territory in the period 1895-1902NOTE. The following extracts from files, documents and evidence are quoted for purposes of ready reference, but it is of course obvious that the conclusions reached by (he Commissioners arc based on the whole of the evidence. There is much important evidence which does not lend itself to quotation in short extracts.SECTION A.ON THE SUBJECT OF THE BOUNDARY WOOD. (lieferring to Sections 32-01 of the Report.) Extracts from Through Masailand (Joseph Thomson), 1S83-S4:  Page 308. &quot; The Masai have made repeated attempts to penetrate into the country, but they have found that the Kikuyu were more than a match for them in their dense forests.&quot;Map from Through Masailand. (Joseph Thomson):  &quot; Tho position of the words &apos;High Forest Region&apos; shows that the forest existed along the eastern boundary, where there is now verylittle trace of it, as well as on the other sides.&quot;Extracts from Discovery by Count Tclehi of Lakes liudolf and Stephanie (Von Hohnel), published in 1894 (the extracts relate to 1387)Page 289. &quot; The Kikuyu do not venture out of the forests for foar of the Masai.&quot;Page 302. &quot;The narrow belt of primeval forest which forms a natural frontier encircling the whole of Kiknyuland.&quot;Page 330. 11 Our camp on tho ridge was near the eastern frontier of kikuyu land, about 2i to 3 miles from tho wood which seems to encircle the whole district.&quot;Page 332. The next two days we marched in a north-easterly direction, at a distance of about 3.J- to 4.V miles from the boundary wood.&quot;Page 352. &quot; The industrious natives have cleared away almost every trace of a forest from the interior, leaving only a belt as a frontier buttress from one to two hours&apos; march deep.&quot;Extract from Early Days in East Africa (Sir Frederick Jackson), relating to 1891:  Page 169. &quot; Our camp just outside the protective belt of forest and natural boma of Kikuyu.&quot;Extract from The Pise of Our East African Empire (Lord Lugard), 1893: -Page 419. &quot; It (Kikuyu) is surrounded by a belt of very fine timber forest.&quot;
APPENDIX I contd.Extract from Kenya from Chartered Company to Crown Colony (Hobloy):-l&apos;age 140. &quot; Much of the land so allocated (to settlers) was a buffer zone between the Masai and Kikuyu.&quot;Extract from British Mission to Uganda in 189.3 (Sir Gerald Portal): -&quot; We left the open plain and plunged into the darkness of a dense bolt of forest which forms the natural boundary of the regions inhabited by tho treacherous, cunning and usually hostile people of the Kikuyu.&quot;Extract from British East Africa or IlifiA (P.L. McDermott) 1895:-Page 423. &quot; Encircled by a dense belt of forest, which affords effective protection to tho people from their enemies.&quot;Extract from James Hanninglon (Her. E. g. Dawson), 1885:   Page 342. -&quot;August 25th :  Arrived in tho evening at Ngongo a Bagiis.   This place is situated on the borders of Masai land and the country  of the Kikuyu. . . .    Tho  Kikuyu   inhabit  tho  forest-clad uplands, which here abut upon the plains of the Masai country. . . .&quot;Page 343. &quot; Tho bishop was very anxious to hold some inter-course with the Kikuyu, but they dared not venture down to his camp. Ho therefore went up to them with an escort of only ten men. Even then, he failed to gain their confidence. So far from attempting to do him any violence, the unhappy Wa-Kikuyu (led before him every-whero.&quot;Page 334. &quot; After waiting two hours, a single man came out from the forest, with fresh leaves in his hand, as a mark of submission and peace. He said the Chief was close by, and wanted to know whether we had come to light or to buy grain. We explained . . . Three men next stepped out of the wood, told us the Chief was coming, and disappeared. Then the Chief came towards us, a man of about fifty years old, and half-drunk, reeling to and fro like a ship in a storm. . . . They refused to eat tnuma with us, and clamoured for the presents, which I gave them; after that they promised to bring food for sale. Off they went, and in a quarter of an hour buying and selling began . . .&quot;Page 3-17. &quot; Things wont for a whole very smoothly, though our famishing men were hard to restrain; till suddenly the cry of &apos;Masai&apos; was raised, and a number of warriors leapt from the jungle with spears and shields. It was a false alarm, but the Kikuyu took fright, and again the market was stopped . . . The apparently desolate forest was in reality swarming with the Kikuyu; but they live in impene-trable fastnesses. Even the Swahili traders, with all their pretences, have not succeeded in peeping into their huts, and the formidable Masai cannot cope with them in tho recesses of their own forest high-lands. On Monday, the 7th, a more successful attempt was made to purchase food. Tho Bishop again wont out with about a hundred men, whom he caused to sit in a circle while he dealt with the natives. Tho plain was soon crowded with the Kikuyu, who pressed in on every side. Our men, who had no trust in them, each had his loaded gun by his side. It was, however, almost impossible to prevent things from being stolen by these thievish people . . .&quot;
APPENDIX J contd.Extract from Through Musailand (Joseph Thomson):  Page &apos;.107. (At Ngongo Bagas): &quot; We had to try to get into con-ivuxion with the Kikuyu to buy food.   It was not an easy matter. . . .The large numbers of Masai who came to tlio camp by their presenceprevented their enemies venturing down to us. ...   A fight resulting in several deaths took place.&quot;Extracts from The Genesis of a Colony (R. O. Preston):   Of tho forest near Nairobi, he states: &quot; Those people (tho Kikuyu) lived in fear and trembling of the Masai, and would not venture out ill their forest country. When therefore the rails arrived in their country, and the hordes of railway workmen appeared on the scone, the Kikuyu felt safer and ventured out more.&quot;Of the Escarpment forest, he states: &quot;The Masai constantly preyed on their timid neighbours and were ever on the alert to drive oft&apos; any sheep or cattle that might stray a short distance from tho herds. Lying on the plains for days, they would watch their oppor-tunity and silently stealing up the hill would drive tho wanderers down the mountain. When a Kikuyu herdsman caught sight of a Masai anywhere in their vicinity, he would sound the warning cry that would at once be taken up by all the women in the fields for miles along the escarpment, and the herdsmen would hurriedly gather their flocks together and make for safety, further up the mountain.&quot;From the evidence of Hassan bin Jumbe (Evidence, p. 244):   1 was on a safari with Count Teleki, who was known to the natives as Dakitumbo. He went to Ndoro in Masai country, about four days&apos; march from the Kikuyu border. Nyeri was then Kikuyu country and the Uaso Nyiro was the Kikuyu boundary in the north and the Chania was the boundary between Masai and Kikuyu in the south. Count Teleki met the Samburu people near Rudolf.&quot;from the evidence of Hindi bill Hamisi (Evidence, p. 242):   &quot; Mr. Thomson went to Ngongo Bagas. The place was inhabited by Masai, who were in fact spread over the wdiole countryside, includ-ing Thathmi. The manyatta of the Laibon Lenana was at Keya. On two occasions I visited Ngongo Bagas: once with Mr. Jackson, and once with Bishop Hannington, and saw Masai there but no Kikuyu. If we wanted food, we used to follow the Kikuyu with thirty or forty riflemen, and buy food at their market at Dagoretti, which was then in Masai country; so was Karen Estate, so was Mararoi.&quot;SECTION B.ON THE EXTENT OF KIKUYU OCCUPATION ON PLAINS BEYOND THE BOUNDARY WOOD. (Referring to Sections 45-51 of the Report.) Mr. 0. W. Hobley, C.M.G., speaking of 1894:-&quot; We . . . camped on the future site of Nairobi Town.   It was an open plain with relics of old Masai villages, and there were many skulls of Mastii who had died in  a smallpox epidemic a few years previously.   There was no evidence of the Kikuyu having established any villages or cultivation on the plains outside the forest belt.&quot;
APPENDIX I contd.Colonel Ainsworth, C.M.G., D.S.O., C. 15.10., writes that in 1892 ho recovered a number of Masai women and children, who had been captured by Akaniba, and wishing to hand thorn back sot out to find the Masai.   He continues:  &quot; Wo eventually arrived within the vicinity of tho place we know now as Muthaiga, where some kraals were located. Here I handed over the women and children. . . . As I wanted to buy somo donkeys for transport, the Masai took me to some kraals located near the Kamiti River. I went short distances up some of the forest glades. I, how--ever, saw no cultivation and no natives other than the Masai.&quot;But in another part of his memorandum he records:   &quot; Long beforo 1898, those sections of the Masai who had been in the habit of occupying tho grazing along the forest area had become considerably weakened through pleuro amongst their cattle, and smallpox. During 1s96, it was necessary to take tho remnants of the Kapfce and Matapatti elans under tho direct protection of Government, arid they wero moved temporarily to a place near Fort Smith, but early in 189G we moved them to Ngong. . . . From this time on, the grazing north of the Nairobi River was less and less used by the Masai, but up to about 1898 a few kraals were to be seen on the higher land now known as Nairobi Hill.&quot;SECTION C.ON THE SUBJECT OF THE NORTHERN BORDER NEAR NYERI.(Referring to Sections 73-87 of the Report.) Senior Chief Wambugu (Evidence, p. 83):  &quot; Another old man called Wangai Kigira used to go to the junction -of the Amboni and Gathingurengai Rivers for the same purpose (sacrifice).&quot;Evidence of Chief Enderi (Evidence, p. 85):  &quot; Our grandfathers used to tell us that the boundary with the Masai was the Amboni River.&quot;Evidence of Chief Nduini (Evidence, p. 107):  &quot; The boundary of tho Kikuyu was the Amboni. . . .&quot;Q. &quot;Were the Dorobo beforo the Kikuyu?&quot;A. &quot; Neither was there before tlie other. When we went to hunt wo used to find their fires. Our great-grandfathers used to tell us that they found Dorobo living on the other side of the river, but there was a market where we used to sell food to them. They used to wander about, and even went as far as Chief Murigo&apos;s home to hunt.&quot;Evidence of Kithegi Kagwamba (Evidence, p. 109):  &apos;- These  Europeans  camped  at Munyu  Airitu.   It  was Kikuyucountry.   Now it is on -Mr. Tuke&apos;s farm, between tho Nairobi and:Sagana Rivers.&quot;Evidence of Wambugu Mwigwa (Evidence, p. 110):  Q. &quot; Did you tell Mr. Evans that in your young days there weremo Kikuyu north of the junction of the Chania and Sagana Rivers?&quot; A. &quot; Yes, 1 did.&quot;
APPENDIX I contcl.Revision Case No. 23/29, Nyeri: Statement by Muhoya Kagumba ^tho defendant):  &quot; Before tlie Government came, all that land was Bush, and no-body went there because of lions and elephants and the Masai. When my father went in, although he was not the first man who went into the bush, nobody else had established himself in that part, and no ithaka had boon fixed.&quot; (Note. Tho land in question was in Ihururu githaka, near Nyeri Hill.)Extract from King of the Wakikuyu, (John Boyes), p. 132:   &quot; Arriving at last at Kakeri&apos;s village, we were met by the chief himself and some of tho elders of the tribe.&quot;Evidence of Mr. John Boyes (Evidence, p. 729):  Tho Chairman made reference to a passage in Mr. Boyes&apos; book, reading, &quot; There is now a fort and Government station at his old place at Nyeri, where I had first come across him,&quot; and asked:  Q. &quot; Could you swear if that was the actual spot? &quot;A. &quot; No, I could not.&quot;Extract from King of the Wakikuyu (John Boyes), p. 151:  &quot; It was Wangombe&apos;s boast that Mount Kenya belonged to him,and tho Wanderobo were his people, and joined him if there was a fight.&quot;Evidence of Mr. John Boyes (Evidence, p. 729):   Q. &quot; Had Karuri got a lot of people? &quot;A. &quot; Yes; but after I crossed the Chania River there were no more Kikuyu. Wangombe lived on the south-west slopes of Kenya on a hill near Ragati River at Kargona.&quot;Evidence, p. 730:  &quot;Near Nyeri, tho Chania River was considered the boundary, but Kikuyu went to graze their cattle on the north side after the Masai had shifted.&quot;Evidence of Brother Benedetto (Evidence, pp. 546, 547): -&quot; When I came here in 1903 there wore no natives on the whole .of our present farm. There were some Masai on the polo ground. . . . I hear that tho Aithirandu Clan were on the west of Nyeri Hill. I never heard of anybody claiming the other side. . . . Before we came here, the Aithirandu Clan claimed tho west side of Nyeri Hill, .at, I think, the line they marked on the other side of the Chania River.  Tho name &apos;Muthari&apos; means &apos;placo of division&apos; in Kikuyu.&quot;SECTION D. ON THE WESTERN FRONTIER. (Referring to Sections 95-128 of the Report.) Evidence of Mr. F. W. Isaac (Evidence):  &quot; The forest was tho hiding-place of their live stock. They were ;pasturing in the forest glades.&quot;Q. &quot; Could they pasture cattle in the forest itself? &quot;A. &quot; No, not cattle, but they could pasture goats. All those forests are divided up, and you will got open glades suddenly in the middle of the forest.&quot;
APPENDIX I contd.&quot; At the back (of the Aberdare forest) it would have been entirely Dorobo. The disputes which arose, which I can remember, were largely botween Wa-Kikuyu and Dorobo. . . . They wero scattered. If they wero hungry they would go and steal tho honey, and periodically the Kikuyu would steal theirs back again to got even. Then there would probably bo a murder.&quot;Extract from a Memorandum by tho Port Hall Native Council (Evidence, p. 119):-&quot; Tho boundaries on the west of Fort Hall District were in the earliest times as follows:  &quot; From the junction of Chania and Kiboro Rivers (which was the boundary of Kikuyu and Masai, who met with the Masai at a place called Gatura-ini).&quot;-From Kiboro River to the junction of lbuteti and Chania Rivers right up to Gathara-ini to the junction of Gathara-ini and Turasha Rivers, thence to Mutarakwa or Gitamaiyu (whore Kikuyu of Fort Hall and Nyeri were making their sacrifices before proceeding to Masai Reserve).&apos;&apos;Evidence of Lokomoro 0/0 Mbirya (Kakanyuki: Masai) (Evidence, p. 238):-&quot; i showed you four different manyattas. One at Uplands (Ngar-oya&apos;s), one (my own) at Escarpment, two at tho junction of Limuru and Kikuyu roads, one between two hills, in the valleys. I swear that all these were in Alasai country and were not Kikuyu country.&quot;Evidence of Turuthi wa Githei (Dorobo) (Comments on above), (Evidence, p. 239) :-&quot; Most of tlio evidence given by these Masai is quite untrue. . . . They (the witnesses) said they had their manyattas at Escarpment (Lari) and Uplands.  They never had their manyattas there.&quot;From the evidence of Abdulla bin Omari (Evidence, p. 213):   &quot; Mr. Hall and I saw Lelian at Uplands. His manyatta was just below the station, and he herded his cattle above it. Where Escarp-ment Station now is was purely Masai country. The Masai wero at Kijabe when Mr. Dick was killed, and indeed their country stretched from Kijabe to the Kinangop, and on to Naivasha. The Kikuyu stayed in tho forest because they were afraid of tho Masai.&quot;Evidence of Mr. Battiscombe (Evidence, p. -108):   Regarding 1907 or thereabouts: &quot;The greater part of the forest round the Lari Swamp . . . was claimed by a native chief ... to have been bought from the Dorobo, but his claim was not recognized by Government. ... I think they still claim a great deal of that forest, but the claim has never been recognized (the southern end of the forest surrounding Uplands Bacon Factory). He claimed the whole nf the forest.&quot; -- ;&quot; There was cultivation by Kikuyu. They were encroaching in the forest. Tho Railway had been constructed, and the country settled, and there was nothing to worry the natives; I think they were increas-ing their cultivation then. . . . The Kikuyu were all eating into the forest. . . . To a certain extent, secondary forest grew up behind them, but they were continually going on nil tho time.&quot;
APPENDIX I contil.Q. &apos;.&apos; Did you ever sec any signs of boundaries having been cut or indicated by marking trees P &quot;.1. &quot; No. 1 have no recollection of any having been pointed out to mo, or having come across one. 1. do think it is possible that the forest was cut up into sections, but that was for purposes of elephant (ivory) and honey-gathering.&apos;&apos;Evidence of tho Hon. Charles Dundas (regarding 1911) (Evidence, p. -119)Q. &quot; Would they have used tho forest for any distance in? &quot;A. &quot;Oh, yes, they would go a long way in. And there arc also certain grasses and, if I recollect rightly, also mosses which they used for the bedding of stock and so on. Undoubtedly, I should think they might justifiably claim forest territory of which they had tho absolute use before wo came.&quot;Evidence of Air. A. G. Baker (regarding 1907) (Evidence, p. 447): &quot; (On the Aberdare Range? there wero constant encroachments by tho Kikuyu, who were continually burning and destroying the forests, eating their way in. . . Thej- liko every other year to get on to fresh land; they like to get new forest land. I think it was a general.move westwards, as far as 1 could tell.&quot;(,). &quot; I see you say in your memorandum that there were a largo number of pockets, as it wore, of cultivation in tho forest? &quot;A. &quot; Yes. Generally speaking, it was only within, say, half a mile of the edge.  They did not go very far in.&quot;Q. &quot; Where there any traces of cultivation well into tho forest? &quot;A. &quot; Not many.   It was all practically on the edge.&quot;Q. &quot;Was there any grazing inside the forest itself? &quot;A. &quot; Very little. The Kikuyu had very few cattle in those days. . . . (goats) were going into the little glades. They were working in. They would go into the glades and work into the forest, and eat up all the young trees . . . (there were) quite a lot in those days. There wero a good many sheep. Generally speaking, there was not much grazing in the forest. It is a wet tropical forest, and it is naturally very thick. It is only as a result of fires or destruction by human beings or animals that you get much grass at all.&quot;Q. &quot; Did you see any signs of the forest being demarcated in any way between various sections of the tribe? &quot; A. &quot; Not that I saw.&quot;Q. &quot;Did you find beehives in the forest?&quot;A. &quot;Yes; I should say they would be a good way in.&quot;SECTION E. ON THE LIMURU FARM AREA. (Referring to Sections 129-137 of the Report.) Extract from Discovery by Count Teleki, etc. (p. 315):-&quot; On September 12th, wo started again . . . the path leading, as before, over many ridges and streams, tho whole district being covered with  fairly steep  hills,  oxtending north-west and south-east with a south-easterly trend. . . .   The country is almost bare of trees, but
APPENDIX I contd.very well cultivated, the more humid valleys with sugar-cane, more rarely with bananas or colocasia ; the hill slopes with potatoes, beans, millet, tobacco, and so on. . . . Count Teleki at tho head of the caravan had the worst of it, tor he had to clear his way through tho natives, who always gathered in force at the streams. . . .&quot;&quot; Tho next day&apos;s march (September l:itli) took us over tho highest ridge of kikuyu land, and we camped at a height of about 0,800 feet, the maximum reached by us so far. The Hat summit of the ridgo was now completely overgrown with a species of fern from 0.1 to 8 feet high, forming whole thickets. . . . Tho camp was besieged once more by hundreds of natives.&quot;&quot; On September 14th we resumed our inarch amid scenery very much tho same as that just passed through, except that there was less cultivation, with more grass, bush and ferns. The country was, how-ever, still well populated, and we passed several little settlements, consisting of from three to about twenty huts, either hidden in the woods or nestling against the slopes of the mountain in tho midst of banana plantations. . . . Tho number of natives who attended our march increased to thousands as we proceeded, the women and children dashing oil&apos; in terror at the slightest incident, whilst tlio warriors pressed more closely upon the caravan. . . . (A light ensued, followed by a ceremony of blond-brotherhood.) We also paid for the use of our camping ground.&quot;From the evidence of Hindi bin Hamisi (Evidence, p. 243):  &quot; Near Limuru there was a swamp which the Masai called Mnn-gao (Kiboko), and there was a boma nearby belonging to Neilyani.I myself never saw these Masai at Limuru, although I am certain ofmy facts because we Swahili intermarry with the Masai, and they nroour brothers.&quot;Evidence of Hon. A. de V. Wade, Chief Native Commissioner:   &quot; I have often heard Mr. Hope talk about what happened in the Kiambu area. He mentioned the existing boundary, with particular reference to Farm 12.&apos;! and the &quot;corridor&apos;. I asked him about that, and old maps on which this farm used to bo marked &quot;Native Reserve&apos;. He said: &apos; The reason I reserved that farm was that I realized I had been giving away too much grazing, so I secured what T could at the last moment, and made that reserve with the corridor to it.&apos; He said, generally in regard to that bit, and the Limuru farms: &apos; If we had known then what we know now we could not possibly have done it.&apos; Tt was a source of very bitter regret to him.&quot;. (,&apos;. &quot; When he made that statement, did you understand him to mean that, if he had realized what the nature of the Kikuyu native was, he would not have done it? &quot;A. &quot;That is what ho meant when he was talking about these Limuru farms. He knew nothing about the Kikuyu system of land tenure; he thought there; was room for the natives elsewhere, and that no injttstice would be done.   They had compensation.&quot;Evidence of Omar Mohamed (Evidence, p. 1805):   &quot; At Limuru in the old days there were Dorobo. They were Kikuyu Dorobo.&quot;
APPENDIX l-contd.Evidence of Lengimojik, Masai (Evidence, p. 335) &quot; All this Kikuyu land I showed you was ours. Where the Kikuyu Railway Station is now, all that country from Maguga down to the Kikuyu Railway Station and down to Port Smith was Alasai country, including tho Ondiri Swamp and Naikumu, ami all the country wo went through till wo got to Kihoko Swamp belonged to Masai.&quot;SECTION F.ON THE SO i- TIL-WESTERN FRONT JEtt NEAR DAGORETTI. (Referring to Sections 142-155 oj (lie Report.) Extract from Through Masailand (Joseph Thomson), p. 310:   &quot; (Setting out from Ngongo Bagas)   Wo traversed one of the most lovely woodland  scenes. . . .    Roads  ten   to   twenty  feet  broad . . penetrated the woods in every direction.  Every here and there these roads opened out on a beautiful park or charming glade.   Everywhere were evidences of tho presence of elephants, although wo saw none. These fine footpaths were a great puzzlo to mo at first. . . .   On in-quiry, J  found that they had been formed by the continual passage of the great herds of the Masai between the different open roaches in the forest.&quot;Extract from The liise of our East African Empire (Lord Lugard), 1893: -Rage 320. &quot; .1 spout some time in examining the surrounding country (i.o. from Port Smith) towards the forest under tho guidance of the local chief, Eiyeki, and his brothers, and eventually selected a charming site at a little distance from the cultivation and villages. A clear mountain stream flowed at the foot of the slope; beyond was dense forest: in rear was another stream. Timber and fuel were of course iu abundance. Tho name of the place was Dagoretti.&quot;Rage 332.--&quot; (In building tho fort at Dagoretti) we paid tho penalty of disturbing the virgin soil, in a certain amount of fever in the caravan.&quot;Extract, from, the private diary of Captain I&apos;. I). Lugard (now Lord Lugard):--&quot; To-day we settled up with Eiyeki and gave him a handsome pre-sent for the ground, etc. Altogether, to various chiefs, headmen, etc., everything included and deducting the value of 5 sheep bought, I estimate wo. had given the local value of 14 goals for presents, land, etc.   .1 think this very fair on both sides.&quot;Extract from Soldiering and Surveying in British East Africa (-Major J. R. L. Mac-Donald, R.E.) (1891-94), p. Ill:--&quot;In 1890, tho Company decided to form a station near Kikuyu . . . and Captain Lugard was entrusted with this tusk. . . . luigard decided on a place called Dagoretti. He chose the site more for poli-tieal than military considerations, as he considered that there would be less chance of friction with the natives if tho fort was not actually located among their clearings. By this means he also hoped to he able to influence the Masai, who could hardly venture to visit a station in the midst of their hereditary enemies, although they might go to Dagoretti with safety.&quot;
KENYA LAND COMMISSION REPORT

APPENDIX I-contd.

From a judgment by Mr. Justice Maxwell (Supreme Court Case 43?8/20 of 17th November, 1920: Kimani and Kitosho, sons of Kahoto versus Kioi wa Nagi)-

" Up to that year (1899), and probably after, two rival bands of Masai used to come to this neighbourhood raiding. In one, probably the last such raid, Kahoto, the putative father of both plaintiffs, was killed, &apos;one harvest before the famine&apos;. According to one old gentleman, in 1899 the Masai and the Dorobo were &apos;fighting with tongues and not with spears&apos;. I cannot be far wrong then in assuming that after the raid in which Kahoto was killed there was an armistice, and that &apos;peace was signed&apos; some few months later.

" And one of the conditions of peace was that the Masai were to have all that part of my imaginary square south of the Neangara River and the Dorobo were to move over to the north of it.....

" I am satisfied that it is an historical fact. The entries in the Dagoretti record book allude to it. Ellagombe (a Masai) and Thinde Nuanambe (Dorobo) ... speak of it quite clearly."

(Note.-The sketch plan at the head of it makes it clear that the section of the Neangara River in reference is a stretch of approximately five miles immediately to the north of Dagonetti ?)

Evidence of Mr. Johnstone Kenyatta (Evidence, p. 426):-

" The Ngong is a boundary.... The Masai call it Ngong, and we call it Gitiba.... Take people like the missionaries who are near to the boundaries, like Dr. Arthur. When he built his mission house there he would have started teaching the Masai, or he would have got his land from the Masai. I think that is a proof showing that the land along there was occupied by Kikuyu people ..."

" Wayaki was not very far away from Dagoretti, and not very far from the Ngong River. All that part used to be Kikuyu land. You have asked me about my personal experience. I remember when I was a young boy ... it must have been some time ago, because there was no ? in Dagoretti; we used to take our sheep and goats to the Gitiba, where there were salt-licks.... I know the land there used to belong to Kikuyu. Gitiba is south-west of Dagoretti on the way to Ngongo Bagas, but nearer to Ngongo Bagas."

Evidence of Chief Koinange (Evidence, p. 245):-

" What was really known as the boundary between the Masai and Kikuyu was the Mbagathi River."

From the evidence of Hindi bin Hamisi (Evidence, p. 244):-

" The Kikuyu who brought food to the Dagoretti market lived across the Karura River. There were no Kikuyu where the Scotch Mission now is. There were Masai living there. I remember quite clearly that we moved them from what is now the Scotch Mission land owing to the fact that they were infected with smallpox."

Evidence of Mr. C. R. W. Lane (relating to 1896) (Evidence, p. 400):-

"South of the Railway there were natives in the vicinity of Dagoretti.... Before the move to Laikipia there were Masai all round Lake Elmenteita and Nakuru, and they were moved up to Laikipia with the Naivasha Masai. The Kikuyu then spread from the vicinity of Dagoretti towards Ngong, occupying lands which hitherto had belonged to the Masai."
APPENDIX I contil.Evidence of Dr. .1. W. Arthur (Evidence, p. 456):   &quot; They (the Kikuyu) spread south until thoy readied the Dagorotti area. . . .    Even  at  the  lime  tho mission  came there was  a good deal of forest there that is not there now.   The mission itself stands absolutely on the south-westernmost point of the Kikuyu country.&quot;4th September, 1912: Provincial Commissioner, Naivasha (Mr. JT. W. T. McClellan), writing to tho Provincial Commissioner, Nairobi (on tho subiecfc of the Kikuyu claiming tho source of tho Mbagathi River as &quot;Kikuyu water&quot;): -&quot; If there is likely to be friction over this water source, T would suggest that tho Kikuyu ho removed to the lino jusfc below the Dagorctti Station, which was their boundary in 1902.&quot;13th February, 1912: Mr. M. W. Beech, Assistant District Coin-missioner, Dagorctti, writing to Mr. F. G. Hamilton, District Com-missionor, Ngongo Bagas: &quot;In tho event of further dispute, 1 am prepared to furnish in-disputable evidence proving that the country really belongs to tho Kikuyu as far as tho Ngong Hills.&quot;18th March, 1913: Provincial Commissioner, Naivasha (Mr. Mc-Clellan), writing to Chief Secretary:  &quot; I know the country in question and (he respoetivo rights of Kikuyu and Masai probably better than anyone, as I selected tho Dagoretti Station site (i.c. the new station at Dagoretti, which was made after tho old station made by Captain Lugard had been des-troyed), in order to be on the dividing line as nearly as possible between the Kikuyu and the Masai. Mr. Iloblcy, however, having only Kikuyu with him, went over a line agreeable to them, which, as gazetted, gave Kirianjui, a man with no hereditary claim whatever, the lands on which the Masai kraals stood, including Lenana&apos;s, in 1902. We therefore have not only deprived tho Masai of grazing land . . . but have now taken away their water supply by giving it to the tribe they most despised, i.e. tho Kikuyu.&apos;&apos;15th December, 1912: District Commissioner, Ngongo Bagas, to Provincial Commissioner, Naivasha (regarding the fence erected near tho Mbagathi):-&quot; On the Kikuyu side of this fence is a vast amount of land which was undoubtedly Masai. I was shown to-day the site of an old kraal of Lonana&apos;s, perhaps a mile from the fence, where Kinaujui now keeps a large herd of cattle, which .[ saw grazing.&quot;8th April, 1913: Provincial Commissioner, Nairobi (Mr. C. W. Hobley), writing to Chief Secretary:  &quot; I would point out that tho area immediately north of tho lino was not occupied by the Kikuyu on their own initiative, but the Quar-antino Board, with the approval of Government, moved some 10,000 head of stock into that area off tho European farms, and there was no other area to move the cattle to . ... No land was given to Kinanjui. Kinanjui is only one among many Kikuyu stock owners . . . ho has never claimed hereditary rights . . .&quot;
APPENDIX J could.31st May, 1913: Provincial Commissioner, Nairobi (Mr. S. L. Hinde), writing to Chief Secretary:  &quot; I have no hesitation in stating that Mr. McCIellan is right in that tho Masai certainly in 1898, when i was stationed at Ngong, oc-eupied the banks of the Mbagathi River and several miles to the north of this river. Their stock route ran north-west to within a couple of miles of the Sclater Road, about two hours&apos; inarch west of what is now Kikuyu Railway Station.&quot;SECTION G.ON THE NORTH-EASTERN FRONTIER, NEAR FORT SMITH AND TOWARDS NAIROBI. (Referring to Sections 15G-102 of the Report.)Evidence of Mr. Hobley (Evidence, p. 442):  &quot; (1891, starting from Nairobi) There was no evidence of the Kikuyu having established any villages or cultivation on the plains outside tho forest belt. Within about half a mile of our camp wo entered tho forest. We passed through a quarter or half a mile of forest, and then passed an open area which in later years became the sports ground. There was no occupation in this stretch. We then passed through another belt of forest, perhaps a mile thick, and then entered a scrub-covered area, with occasional villages of Kikuyu which extended to what is now Fort Smith. At Fort Smith, we found Mr. F. G. Hall in command. This station had been founded a collide of years previously. There was a considerable amount of Kikuyu cultiva-tion and occupation in the vicinity . . .&quot;&quot; Dagoretti had been vacated by Mr. George Wilson owing to an attack by the natives. In the vicinity of this fort (Fort Smith) there was also a considerable settlement of Masai. I understood that this section had quarrelled with the main Masai, and they had been brought there by Mr. Hall for shelter.&quot;Extract from Memorandum by Colonel Ainsworth (Evidence, p. 494):-&quot; Early in 1893, the Kikuyu of Lugtiru and the area round Fort Smith attempted the same tactics which were successful in the case of Dagoretti ; they also endeavoured to invest the station. Mr. Purkiss was successful in getting a message through to Machakos. upon receipt of which I left at once with a mixed force to help Purkiss. We pro-ceeded via Muthaiga, and duly arrived at Fort Smith. The arrival of this force was the signal for the Kikuyu to disperse. It was only the fact that between Muthaiga and Fort Smith very few villages existed until close to Fort Smith that onabled us to arrive at our destination without any hostile opposition on the part of the Kikuyu.&quot;Evidence of Mr. Lane (Evidence, p. 400):  &quot; 1898. There were dense forests on either side of the road from Nairobi to Fort Smith. All caravans had to close up here, as there were always natives in the bush to spear the stragglers. Very soou this country was brought under administration by the late Jlr. Frank Hall, and caravans were able to pass through unmolested. I have often ridden through the valleys down to Nairobi, shown on the north of the Uganda Railway, and I found native stock grazing in those valleys. I &quot;cannot remember whether there was any cultivation. I know thoy wero grazing lands.&quot;
APPENDIX I control.Evidouce of Hindi bin Hamisi (Evidence, p. 24.3):   &quot; Mr. Hall told one section of the Masai to live at Port Smith, and they built their manyatius there. Tho Kikuyu were then some distance off, although at the time the Fort was built by Major Smith it was then in Kikuyu country. There was a Misai manyatta where the present Agricultural Showground is, near Kabete. This was beforo tho Loita fighting. Lord Delamere actually built his house at Loresho. which was in Kikuyu country &quot;Evidence of Abdulla bin Omari (Swahili) (Evidence, p. 243):   &quot; There was a Masai manyatta where the present Agricultural Showground is near Kabete.  This was before tho Loita fighting.&quot;Evidence of Ole Pidis (Kaputie Masai, age about 50-60) (Evidence, P. 237):-&quot;When Mr. Hall was heye, Kikuyu were on the Showground. They were right up to Fort Smith; going to Fort Smith all that was full of Kikuyu. They were like grass at this place called Ngechi. At the time when the white people came to this country, some Kikuyu had crossed over on the other side of tho Nairobi River, and were cutting down forest.&quot;Evidence of Mr. John Patterson (Evidence, p. 744):- -&quot; Mr. AVatson and myself went to Kikuyu ... in September, 1895. Wo stayed in Kikuyu until October. During that time we examined the country round Fort Smith. . . . From Nairobi to Fort Smith the greater part of the Kikuyu country was forest, intersected with small open glades, and in one part of the country of which I am speaking theso glades were occupied by Masai and Dorobo, who were grazing their cattle. The Masai munyattas were all over these plains. Also at that time, the Kikuyu forest extended from Nairobi round the edge of the country to Fort Hall.&quot;Evidence of Mr. T. A. Wood (Evidence, p. 742):  &quot; (1902) I took up a piece of land on the Karura River-Limuru Road the road that goes through the top half of Mnthaiga, north-west of the Karura Forest Reserve (vide map 19/1). When I took up that land there were one or two natives living on it. This was in 1902. Just a few Kikuyu.&quot; I was taking up a piece of land for residential purposes on tho other s;de of Ainsworth Bridge; the house which is behind tho one called &apos;Daraia&apos;. . . . There were one or two native kraals there, and I paid compensation to tho natives at Mr. Ainsworth&apos;s suggestion.&quot;Q. &quot; Kikuyu natives? &quot;A. &quot; Yes.&quot;&quot; (Regarding Eastleigh) I do not remember anyone being there at all. It was all black cotton soil.  There was a small settlement now known as  Pangani, which  Government are  now trying to  remove. Natives of all kinds were there.&quot;Q. &quot; The plot which you had at Karura, did you see any native occupation round you? &quot;A. &quot;Very little; just odd ones here and there.&quot;&quot; (Regarding tho country from Nairobi to Ruiru, flanking the Fort Hall Road, 1904-05): That part of tho country seemed to be very empty in those days. That part was given out to European settlers, mainly because it was bare then . . .&quot;
APPENDIX I-contd.Q: &quot; You do not recollect any signs of native occupation near the Showground ? &quot;.1. &quot;I do not remember seeing any. If there had boon I should have seen them. . . . It was a sort of buffer area between Masai and Kikuyu.&quot;Evidence of Father Bernhard (Evidence, p. 721):   &quot; (Regarding 1901) A man, Gathuku wa Chege, claims one mile by two miles of land on St. AustiiPs Mission Estate. . . . Gathuku occu-pied hardly three acres of that land, huts and cultivated land together. Put even to that he had only the Chief Kinaniui&apos;s permission to use it, as it was Kinanjui&apos;s, and the chief gave it to tho mission. ...&quot;&quot;The old aerodrome (Dagoretti and Ngong Roads) is claimed by the Kikuyu and some individuals to be theirs, whereas all know that it was not occupied by Kikuyu, and was in Masai area.&quot; (The witness goes on to explain that the Masai who were living there when lie came were refugees, and that the nearest Kikuyu were on Mr. ThoiusonVs estate.)&quot; Kinanjui, then the chief, and a blood-brother of the Masai, was acknowledged by the Masai and Kikuyu as being the chief controller of land on tho south side of the Nairobi River. . . .&quot;Q. &quot;Was there no occupation on the mission land?&quot;.1. &quot;Only the chief, Kanathego, Njuguna and his people.&quot;(). &quot;Did your land consist entirely of forest?&apos;&apos;A. &quot; Yes.   Just a few huts dotted here and there.   There, were very few shambas and a few cut trees.&quot;&quot; . . .(Note. The impression conveyed by this evidence is that Kinanjuiobtained this land as being an acknowledged- chief and also as havingestablished friendly relations and blood-brotherhood with the Masai,and that other Kikuyu wero only there by his permission; in that case,the beginning of this settlement could not well be earlier than 1895.)Evidence of Mr. McQueen (Evidence, pp. 716-718):   &quot; I arrived in 1S96. ... I remained at Fort Smith for some time and returned to Nairobi in March, 1S98. . . . We first located tlie Kikuyu round where the Scott Laboratory is now. . . . There were no Kikuyu natives near the French Mission nor along by Kiii-mani all Masai.&quot; In 1898, I built my house, by the Cemetery. It was tho first European house in Nairobi. I had to pay Sb. 5 a month for my plot. Ono Alasai munyatta was to the right and one to the left. ... 1 was on the plains, but right up against the forest.&quot; In 1897, I went out with Mr. Hall, of Fort Smith, on an elephant hunt. 1 should say we were about eight miles north of Port Smith. . . . There were plenty of Kikuyu there.&quot;Q. &quot; Did you notice any difference in where tiie Kikuyu were from the time in October, 1896, when you first arrived at Fort Smith, and when yon came from Uganda in 1902? &quot;&apos;&apos;      A. &quot;Rather.   They were stretching down that way,  in spite of having lost large&apos; numbers from the famine.&quot;
APPENDIX  L contd.Q. &quot;Wore there more in 1902 than 1890?&quot;.1. &quot; Yos; spreading towards Nairobi and Ngong.Evidence of Mr. Sandbach Baker (Evidence, p. 653):  Q. &quot; Were the Kiknyu at Government House? &quot;.4. &quot; That was getting on to the boundary. They were down below Government House, but there were Masai to the north of the Ngong River and to the- south of Nairobi. The Kikuyu were certainly on both sides of the Nairobi River, i.e. above Nairobi, because the French Mission were the first people to start round there, and they wero working in the Kikuyu country.   That is from memory.&quot;Evidence of Canon Leakey (regarding tho land round the site of the Church Missionary Society Mission at Kabete, 1902) (Evidence, p. 817):-&quot; The first thing my predecessor. Dr. MacGregor, did when i ar-tived was to show me the boundaries . . . We bought only from the mbari of Muthemba. . . . The whole land in the neighbourhood was parcelled up into mbaris.&quot;(Tho witness goes on to state that two miles east of the mission land at Kabeto was the boundary of Mr. Cooper&apos;s land, and that natives named Kariuki wa Muti and Mingu had land on or near tho site of the Government farm. Ho regarded the land as having, been held in clan ownership.)Evidence of Dr. Tl. A. Boedeker (regarding 1S96) (Evidence, p. 095):-&quot; We marched in a straight line to the Nairobi River and camped at tho present causeway where the Limuru Road begins, which was then dense forest, which began at that point. After leaving the last camp, there was no sign of cultivation until we reached the placo where the Scott Laboratory now stands. We saw a very few Kikuyu huts on both sides of the road, but on approaching Fort Smith the huts began to increase in numbers and there were more signs of cultivation. There was a good deal of forest on both sides of the road: not con-tinuous, but in patches. Where the Kabeto Veterinary Laboratory now is was all open grazing laud, which was being grazed by Kikuyu people round there.&quot;Evidence of Omar Mohamad, a Bajun (Evidence, p. 1S65):   &quot; When we came up from Mombasa we knew Fort Smith.   The Masai had not reached Fort Smith. Nairobi in the old days was Masai country up to Ngong.   Near to Fort Smith we found Kikuyu. . . . There were a lot of shambas at Fort Smith.&quot;Summary of points in a letter written by Mrs. I Undo, widow of Mr. S. L. Hinde, at one time a Provincial Commissioner:  &quot;In 1S9S, the forest extended, and was actual forest, to the Parklands side of the Nairobi River; there wero also a considerable number of trees on the Nairobi River side. The first stretch of the road to Fort Smith was through part of this forest, and there was also forest between Fort Smith and Ngong, sparse on the Fort Smith sido but fairly dense from Dagoretti on and between Ngong and Nairobi. The forest was irregular in patches, and it had always been the right of the Masai to graze their cattle along the edges of the forest during tho dry weather when  there was not sufficient grass on tho plains.
APPENDIX l-contd.Since the Kikuyu had, in these days, their villages and their cultivation in the forest (for fear of tho Masai raids), clashes during the drought wore frequent. These were stopped, and the position was regulated by the partition of the land and the definite boundaries fixed. The Masai retained their right over certain stretches of the forest tho outer fringe. The boundary was very uneven, but it was accepted by Lenana for the Masai and by Kinanjui for the Kikuyu, and it was honourably kept.&quot; Ngong in 1898 was undisputed Masai territory; the Wanderobo were not hunting there, as the game was easily approached, which was never tho case in regions where the Wanderobo wero hunting.&quot;SECTION II. ON THE EASTERN FRONTIER. (lieferring to Sections Ki.3-214 of the Iteport.) Evidence of Mr. F. W. Isaac (regarding 1892) (Evidence) :   &quot; There w-as nothing at all on the Athi Plains.  They had all been wiped out with smallpox.   It was absolutely hare.   There was nothing but game.&quot;Extract from letter from District Commissioner, Kiambu, No. 346/21/13 of April, 191.3, to the District Commissioner, Fort Hall:-&quot; . . . . Some questions have arisen as to tho date on which tho Masai evacuated this part of the Kikuyu Reserve, and it has been sug-gested that Kibalabala might possibly be able to throw some light on this question. Could you very kindly obtain from him the approximate date on which the Masai used the salt-lick which is close to this station; whether he can remember the Masai herding their cattle there; or how it was they gave it up. Any information on this question I shall be grateful for.&quot;Letter from District Commissioner, Embu, to Provincial Commis-sionor. Kikuyu Province, dated 30th April, i913:  &quot; Kibalabala states that the salt-lick near Kiambu was never used by the Masai, except possibly when they raided the Kikuyu. He says it was a Kikuyu salt-lick.&quot;Evidence of Abdulla Ambari (Swahili) (Evidence, p. 1865):  &quot; T helped build Fort Hall with Mr, Hall. . . . Going from Nairobi to Fort Hall, Ruiru was the first halt. Between Nairobi and Ruiru T did not see any people or shambas on the right; on the left-hand side, I saw shambas up on the hills. Ndarugu was the second day&apos;s halt. On the left again we saw shnmbas up on the hills; nothing on the right. Tho third day&apos;s halt was Punda Milia. I only saw people on the left-hand side up on the hills. On the fourth day we arrived at Fort Hall. On that day we saw people and shnmbas on both sides of the road. We crossed the Maragua. Between Punda Mdia and tho Maragua there were people. There were more on the left-hand side; on the right there wero a few. It was before wo reached Maragua.&quot;Evidence of Omar Mohanied (Evidence, p. 1865):   &quot; In the old days we crossed the country -where Kiambu llown is now.   We saw Kikuyu there.   There wero small shambas not very many of them ...   At Kiambu it was heavy forest; the big trees had not been cut down.&quot;
APPENDIX 1- could.Evidence of Air. C. It. W. Lane (Evidence, pp. -.101, 402):-&quot; Leaving my camp standing. I left at night and went down the valleys to what is now known as Kiambu. I took tho natives by sur-prise, and found their cattle there. Those lands in the vicinity of Kiambu wore grazed over by a few head of cattle, sheep and goats belonging to the Kikuyu. At that time the Kikuyu had very few cattle&apos;.&quot;Prom the evidence of Abdulla bin Oinari (Evidence, p. 243):   &quot; Returning from Fort, Hall, we followed more or less the present track, only we wont, round by Kiliinaboga (Donyo Sabuk). Karura was said by the Masai to bo on their boundary with the Kikuyu. Muthaiga is -Masai country&apos;. Actually, Mr. Jackson camped at Me-piran, which is near the old King&apos;s African Rifles lines beside the Power Station about half a mile from Muthaiga. It was forest country; inside wore the Kikuyu, and outside was entirely controlled by the&quot;Masai.&quot;Evidence of Mr. C. B. Hausborg (Evidence, p. 391):-&quot; (Regarding 1899; on safari from Nairobi.) We followed the plain. The present road follows the Railway to Fort Hall, but we followed the plains along the base of the foothills &quot; in a more or less straight lino from Nairobi, marching east of the present Thika Station &quot; The chief signs we saw of natives tbero were skulls and bones lying on the plain, tin&apos; result of a scrap either between Masai and Wakamha or between tho Masai and Kikuyu probably the latter, I should think. From Thika we marched practically northwards for about 15 miles to Punda Milia.&quot;Q. &quot; What was the condition with regard to occupation of the natives there? &quot;.4. &quot; There was none at all.&quot;Evidence of Mr. John Boyes (regarding 1901) (Evidence, p. 725):   &quot; The donkeys were missing . . .   Wo went all round Parklands,looking for them, and saw no one at all no Masai, Kikuyu, or anyother natives. . . .&quot;Q. &quot; Were the cattle allowed to graze in the Masai country? &quot; .4. &quot;No; they would only graze on tho edge of the country.&quot; Evidence of Mr. R. Woekes (regarding 1903) (Evidence):  &quot; i remember trekking from Nairobi to Fort Hall.   I saw nonatives at all. . . .    There was little (cultivation) as far as I canremember.  I would not say there was any on this side of the MaraguaRiver.&quot;Evidence of Lord Phillimore (regarding 1904) (Evidence, p. 414):   &quot; From the time I left Nairobi until I reached the Thika River, where there was at that time a rope and cradle crossing, I cannot remember having seen any evidence of native cultivation or native herds, and uncommonly few natives on the track, if any.&quot;(Tho witness remembered that at one point he &quot;must have been ablo to see a breadth of quite ten miles of country&quot;.)Evidence of Lord Cranworth (regarding 1906) (Evidence, p. 479):   &quot; On the way from Nairobi to Fort Hall there was no cultivation on the route at all, and I do not think there was a single native.

APPENBIX iii the Extent of Land now in Occupation by Missions, which has been &quot; Taken from Kikuyu.&quot;(The reference is to section 541 of the Report.) Tho following Mission Stations fall wholly or partly within tho area which we havo found to have been Kikuyu Territory, but have boon excluded from the native reserve:  1. Church of Scotland Mission. acres of the 3,000 acres of the Church of Scotland Mission Station at Kikuyu, tho portion which falls within the area found to have been Kikuyu territory is 2,000 acres .....................     a,0002. Consolata Catholic Mission.Of the Consolata Catholic Mission Station at Nyeri the portion which falls within the area found to have been Kikuyu territory is 2,227 acres, of the Con-solata Catholic Mission Station at Limuru the whole (644 acres) falls within the area found to have been Kikuyu territory ...      ...      ...      ...      ...     2,8713. The White Sisters Mission.Of the White Sisters Mission 5,150 acres fall within the area which we have found to have been Kikuyu territory, but is a part which we have found to have been, as to half of it, &quot;lost by abandonment.&quot;  The amount   fully   within   the  area   &quot;taken  from   tlie Kikuyu&quot; is therefore 2,575 acres     ...      ...      ...     2,5754.

Mission Islands in the Reserve. (Vide section 223 (a), Item 11).There are several mission stations held on lease in the reserve, but these are uot excluded from the reserve and are therefore not counted in this total. Only areas held on freehold are counted. Thev comprise L.O. 1150 (30 acres) and L.O. 1067 (32 acres), and other small areas making up the total of approxi-mately 100 acres or 0.10 square miles      ...       ...        100Tctnl7.939
APPENDIX IVVALUATION OF AREAS(Referring to Sections 223 and 224 of the Report.)Concerning Items 1 and 2 of Section 223 (b).The part of Mwea which ranks as given by Government is 174.45 square miles. Wo find that it is of small rise for agriculture, but is passable grazing land, and we consider that, after allowing for its somewhat remote position, we can class 4i acres of it as being equal to 1 acre of good agricultural land of tho Kiambu average. It therefore provides a set-off equivalent to 38.76 square miles of such agricultural land.Note. The evidence as to the value to be attached to this land is conflicting, and we have found difficulty in coming to a valuation. After considering all the circumstances, Mr. Hemsted would have set die proportion as live acres to one, and Captain Wilson (who has made a personal inspection of part of it) would put it at four to one. We have agreed to value it at 4  acres to 1, which the Chairman regards as a fair assessment. He is satisfied, from the evidence of Captain Grant, who lias stated that the natives consider the land to be better than any land except one part, in Ukamba, together with the evidence of Mr. La Fontaine and Mr. Lcckie that, in view of the fact that the Machakos district already has a population of 125 to the square mile, the area is capable of supporting a considerably larger population than that which Mr. Fazan in bis evidence has attributed to it.Concerning Item 3 of Section 223 (b).We find that Ndeiya should be regarded as falling into four parts:  -(a) Twelve square miles of agricultural land.(!)) Twenty-four square miles of good to average grazing land,some of which is arable. (o) Eighteen square miles of second-class grazing land, but of noagricultural value, (d) Twenty square miles suitable for goat pasture, but indifferentfor cattle.In regard to (a). We consider the twelve square miles of agri-eultural land as in other respects fit to be set off, acre for acre, against the land lost, but taking into account the difficulties about water, which have been overcome by bore-holes, and the expense of upkeep of these bore-holes, we consider that a deduction of one square mile is equitable, making the set-off value eleven square miles.In regard to (b). We consider a set-off of three acres of the land against one to be equitable. For purposes of set-off this area then becomes eight square miles.In regard to (c). We consider a set-off of eight acres of the land against one to be equitable. For purposes of set-off this land counts as 2.25 square miles.
APPENDIX IV-contd.in regard&quot; to (d). We consider a set-off of twelve acres to one to be equitable.   This land therefore counts as 1.67 square miles.The total value of Ndeiya for set-oft&apos; purposes is therefore: 11 -f. 8 -p 2.25 -h 1.67 = 22.92 square miles.In making the above assessment we have followed Mr. S. V. Deck, Provincial Commissioner (vide Evidence, pp. 938-939). It is remarkable that another and independent valuation made for us agrees with Mr. Dock&apos;s total to within 0.04 of a square mile.In regard to items 4, 5, and 0, we find that they may be reasonably set off acre for acre, since they are good agricultural land.   Their total area is: 17.29 square miles. The total set-off on the basis becomes:  Square Miles.Mwea       ..................38.76Ndeiya     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   22.92Items 4 to 6     .........      ......   17.2978.97Bay, 79 square miles. This figure has to bo set off against 109.50 square miles &quot;taken by Government&quot;, and the balance of loss to the Kikuyu is thus rendered 30 J square miles, or 19,520 acres.

APPENDIX VIA Short Description of the Githaka System(Being a Scries of Extracts from the Report of the 1929 Committee on-Native Land Tenure in Kikuyu Province.)I. General Description of the Githaka System. &quot; The Githaka System in its integrity is simply the methods of elan aud patriarchal control expressing themselves in relation to the land.&quot;   (Chapter 3, para. 3.)II. The Muramati. &quot; The immediate control lies with a responsible person living on the githaka, called the muramati (administrator), who is usually the eldest son of the senior branch of the mbari resident there. . . . Tho muramati is very chary of interference with the shares of the various occupant families, but it is admitted that, if one family were to diminish and another to increase abnormally, in the last resort, after consultation with the group and the members affected, he has powers of readjustment.&quot;   (Chapter 1, paras. 19-23.)&quot; It is stated that, when the tribal system is intact, the aramali hold an important, and special position in providing the people with their natural leaders and rulers, aud that their disappearance, which would be the natural result of subdivision, would aggravate the problem which is created by the fact that &apos;the youug men as a class have ceased to respect their elders&apos;.&quot;   (Chapter 3, para. 31.)III. General Efficiency of the Githaka System. It is represented as being the greatest possible tribute to the Githaka System that &quot; there are several places in the Nyeri and Fort Hall districts where one may stand and see more than a thousand acres at a stretch with scarcely an acre uncultivated, aud the disputes which occur, though complicated and troublesome, are surprisingly few.&quot;  (Chapter 1, para. 22.)Note. On the other hand, evidence given to the Commission indicates that disputes are far more frequent than they used to be, aud that far too much time and money is spent in litigation.IV. Disintegrating Tendencies in Kiambu District. &quot; The Kikuyu of Kiambu district have definitely departed from normal Kikuyu custom and admit the sale outright either of a whole githaka or a part of a githaka. If the present tendencies were to continue unchecked for another generation, it may be conjectured that in this area the githaka wotdd by that time havo given place to the small holding as the unit of land tenure. . . . Subdivision is in full swing, and though we have not yet got to the individual family (man, wife, and children), and to the small holding . . . definite pro-gress has been made iu that direction.&quot;  (Chapter 1, paras. 25, 29.)Note.-In all districts of the province, except Kiambu, this dis-integration of ithaka is prevented by the device of redeemabilitv (Chap-ter 1, para. 23).
APPENDIX VI-contd.V. The Position of Tenants. &quot; Tenants (ahoi) have no security in theory and may be evicted at will. Hitherto, this has been tempered in practice by the basis of friendship on which the whole transaction rests. As the commercial spirit grows, tho basis of friendship and quasi-feudal dependence dis-appears, and the position of tenants becomes precarious.&quot;VI. Native Aspirations. &quot; Native opinion appears to bo united in considering that the cardinal point is that ithaka shall bo recognized:  .&quot; (a) That owning mbari shall bo secure in tho possession of their land both for tho present and for the future. &quot; (b) That disputes arising shall be settled with due regard for and due knowledge of native law and custom.&quot; It is, however, not impossible that in the Kiambu area some of the more sophisticated natives join with these objects another which is not on all-fours with them, namely, tho hope that registration will teud to confirm the &apos;owner&apos; in the absolute proprietorship of land and facilitate transactions of buying and selling, and they probably have in view the development of private ownership with full title.&quot; (Chapter 1, para. 35.)VII. Individualism and the Githaka System. &quot; When wo observe an evolution in progress which is tending more and more in the direction of individual tenure and away from the controls of tribalism, we shall conclude that, although the process may mark an advance, it is not a ratification of the Githaka System, but a departure from it.&quot;   (Chapter 3, para. 3.)VIII. Causes of Evolution towards Individualism. &quot; The principal causes of the evolution towards individualism are stated to be: (a) The fixation of boundaries; (b) The growth of popula-tion; (c) Money; and (d) Permanent crops.&quot;  (Chapter 3, paras. 4-8.)IX. Modern Requirements &apos;to which the Githaka System is Ill-adapted.A formidable list of modern requirements is given to which the Gitliaka System is stated to be unsuited. It comprises: Townships, trading centres, permanent buildings, requirements of social service, the proper use of grazing, proper security for tenants, and the develop-ment of small holdings. It is not suggested in the Report that these things cannot exist under the Githaka System, but it is stated that difficulties arise in reconciling the Gitliaka System with them. (Chnp-rer 3, para. 9 et seq.)
APPENDIX vii the Method of Tenure for School and Church Plots in theKikuyu Reserve(Note. This Appendix has been written at the request of the Commissioners by Mr. Fazan.   Yide-section 1543 of the Report.) .Plots for Mission Schools and Churches. The Director of Education lias pointed out in his evidence that the initial impetus in starting a school generally comes from the natives. Somebody builds a building generally on his own gilhaka, and invites a mission to take it over as a school. In these initial stages the mission is prepared to accept the position that it has no rights in the land, and that the local body of its African adherents has only such rights as native law and custom allow. In process of time complications may arise, and have in fact arisen in many cases. The githaka holder may die, atid his successor may be less well-disposed to the mission. Or some question may arise as to the inheritance of the property, or there may be a dispute about church doctrine. In any case a time comes when some greater security of tenure is felt to be required.The first point of disagreement now arises. What should next be done? The administrative officers of the province favour the proposal, in respect of a school as apart from a church, that there should be two alternative courses open to the Native Council:  (i) To set apart a plot, on which the Council would build and own  the buildings,  and the mission would only have  ., teaeher&apos;s contract, (ii) To set apart a plot and then lease it to the mission or to a corporate body of its adherents for the purpose of a school to be conducted by the mission. In either ease the work of compensating the right-holder would devolve on the Council, but in 1 he second ease it would reimburse itself from rent.The Director of Education expressed the opinion that the first oi these alternatives, if accepted, would tend to commit Government to a policy of State education, a consideration which must not be allowed to depend on a land issue. Mr. Dougall, Educational Adviser to Protestant Missions, agreed with him. Mr. Calderwood, representing the Church of Scotland Mission, agreed as to the tendency but recommended the course in spite of it.   (Evidence, pp. 2994.)It is agreed on all hands that there is a serious objection to the method by which the Native Council builds and owns the buildings, because the school may also be used as a church. The proposal of Mr. Calderwood, speaking as one of the delegates of the Kenya Mis-commisionary Council, was that in such a case a corner of the plot should be leased or sot apart on special terms to the African adherents of the mission as a church plot while the remainder would be set apart for
5S7APPENDIX VII-cniUd.i\, school. But this course would heavily compromise the Council if over it should desire to make a change in its teaching arrangements and give the contract to another institution.In regard to the method of lease, to which the Director of Educa-tion sees no objection so far as his Department is concerned, the views of the Missionary Council are that, while at present missions arc not likely to avail themselves of it on account of the native opposition to be expected, it might be found that their local native adherents, after forming themselves into a corporate body with a recognized method of succession, could obtain a lease without incur-riug odium. I understand that in such case there would be no objection if the part of the plot which is leased as a school and the part leased as a church should carry separate conditions, a course which has been recommended by a resolution of the Kiambu School Area Committee.The delegates of the Kenya Missionary Council have suggested that something simpler than a lease should be devised, and that at all events there should be no need for survey. Moreover they point out that the right-holder would often prefer to receive no compensa-tion, and they suggest that the full economic rental as provided in section 10 of the ordinance should not be required.A system exists in the Nyeri District by which the Native Council has set aside plots after agreement with the right-holders, who in most cases have agreed to forgo any compensation. The plot lias then been allocated to a mission as a combined school and church plot, and a resolution of the council exists declaring that, if after three years&apos; trial the school is held to be fulfilling a useful function, the right-holder should cease to have any power to evict. This system is said by the District Commissioner to be working well.In regard to the Kiambu District, yet another method has been suggested. Mr. Calderwood proposes that, since outright sale is admitted by native custom in that district, the native adherents of a mission in any locality should be able to buy land for school purposes without approaching the Local Native Council. He agreed that, if the consent of the Provincial Commissioner should be made necessary before a sale under native custom is recognized, it would probably be a useful administrative practice that such consent should not be given unless the applicants had enrolled themselves as a corporate body with a recognized method of succession.I have been asked to give my own conclusions, and shall uow do so. In reaching them i have been guided not only by the evidence and memoranda, but also by records contained in tho minutes of Local Native Council meetings and School Area Committee meetings.The Initial Stage. I agree with the general opinion that with very small schools the buildings should be &quot;held to belong to the native adherents and that no security is required beyond what native custom affords to a tenant.
APPENDIX VII-contd.The Stage when more Security in required. Altogether five-methods have been proposed:  (i) Setting the plot apart, tho Native Council arranging to com-compensate the right-holder, generally by an annual compensation-resembling a rent, whereafter the Council would build such buildings-as arc required, and give the teaching contract to a mission.T. agree with the objection that this method, if made general, would very probably lead to State education, and therefore do not think it satisfactory except perhaps in a few particular instances. I also agree that practical complications would arise, especially in regard to churches. The method therefore is not. generally to be recommended.(ii) Setting the plot apart in the same way as above, but with the difference that the Council does not build tlie buildings itself, but permits a mission or the local adherents of the mission to build them, and the right-holder cannot evict after the first three years.If nothing is paid to (he right-holder, it is obvious that the arrangement can only bo made with his consent. If he requires pay-Government, especially in the form of annual compensation, which, would have to be recovered from the missiou, the method is practically in-distinguishable from lease.So long as the right-holders are content and the method suits the requirements of the district (Nyeri) where it is found, there is much to be said for it. But it does not appear by what right the Council can declare (hat the right-holder may not evict after three years, especially if he has received no compensation. The method appears likely to break down as soon as it is seriously challenged.(iii) Setting the plot apart and then leasing it to a mission or to a corporate body of mission adherents. The Local Native Council would compensate the right-holder by an initial &quot;sweetener&quot; and annual compensation, and would reimburse itself from the rents.Apart from the native objections this method appears to be perfectly sound. The Native Council is practically only the go-between or guarantor between the lessee and the right-holder.A simple method of marking-out could easily be devised, and there is no need for survey. I see no reason why the right-holder should bo required to accept anything less in compensation than the full economic rental of the land, but, if he wishes to be generous, he is at liberty to return it.I do not think that native prejudices should be allowed to stand iu the way. A lease is perfectly fair and is the method of tenure contemplated in the ordinance. While some missions may desire to avoid unpopularity by arranging for their native adherents rather than the governing body to apply for the lease, there are probably other missions which would not agree. No principle of land tenure is in-volved in the issue, and T see no reason why tho same method of lease should not be applied uniformly whether the applicants ire white or black.
APPENDIX VII-contd.(iv) Tho same as No. 8 above, but distinguishing between schools and churches, the lease being in two sections carrying different conditions.The proposal is supported by a resolution of the Kiambu School Area Committee and appears to be generally sound. It is interesting to note that a similar provision was made by the government of the Cape Province of the Union of South Africa in 1900:  &quot;In 1909 the Capo Government decided that applications for joint church and school purposes would not be considered, but that sites would be approved for the single purpose church or school only&quot; (extract from a Government memorandum entitled &quot;Occupation of Church, School and Mission Sites in Native Areas &quot;; 1918).(v) The proposal that in the Kiambu District the native adherents of a mission should be able to form themselves into a corporate body aud buy land for a church or a school, subject to tho approval of the Provincial Commissioner.I see no reason why the proposal should not be considered, but I find no record of any discussion on the point, and therefore prefer to give no opinion. As the sum total of the whole matter, I consider that lease is the propier method, and should be applied wherever possible, and native opinion should be cd\icated to that end. Mean-while other expedients may be justified upon occasion.I have dealt with this question at sonic length because of the difficulties which have been experienced.
APPENDIX viii the MASAI AGREEMENTS(Referring to Sections 645 and 650 of the Report.)AGREEMENT, DATED 10th AUGUST, 1904, BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY&apos;S COMMISSIONER FOR THE EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE AND THE CHIEFS OF THE MASAI TRIBE.We, tlie undersigned, being the Lybon Chiefs (representatives) of the existing elans and sections of the Masai tribes in the East Africa Protectorate, having this 9th day of August, 1904, met Sir Donald Stewart, His Majesty&apos;s Commissioner for tho East Africa Protectorate and discussed fully the question of a land settlement scheme for the Masai, have of our own free will, decided that it is for our best interests to remove our people, flocks and herds into definite reservations away from the railway line, and away from any land that may be thrown open to European settlement.We have, after having already discussed the matter with Mr. Hobley at Naivasha and Mr. Ainsworth at Nairobi, given this matter every consideration, and we recognize that the Government, in taking up this question, are taking into consideration our best interests.Now we, being fully satisfied that the, proposals for our removal to definite and final reserves are for the undoubted good of our race, have agreed as follows :  That the Elburgu, Gekunuki, Eoita, Damat and Laitutok sec-tions shall remove absolutely to Laikipia, and the boundaries of the settlement shall be, approximately, as follows:   On the north, by the Loroghi Mountains. On the west, by the Laikipia (Ndoror) Escarpment. On the south, by the Lesuswa or Nyam and Gtinso Narok Rivers.On the east, by Kisima (approximate).And by the removal of tho foregoing sections to the reserve we &quot;undertake to vacate the whole of the Rift Valley, to be used by the Government for the purposes of European settlement. Further, that the Kaptei, Matapatu, Ndogalani and Sigarari sections shall remove into the territory originally occupied by them to the south of Donyo Lamuyu (Ngongo),. and the Kisearian stream, and to comprise within the area the Donyo Lamuyu, Ndogalani, .and Matapatu Mountains, and tho Donyo Narok, and to extend to Sosian on the west.In addition to the foregoing, Lenana, as Chief Lybon, and his -successors, to be allowed to occupy the land lying in between tlio Mbagathi and Kisearian streams from Donyo Lamuyu to the point where both streams meet, with the exception&quot; of land already occupied bv Mr. Oulton, Mr. McQueen, and Mr. Paterson.
APPENDIX VIII-contd.In addition to the foregoing, we ask that a right of road to include certain access to water be granted to us to allow of our keeping up communications between the two reserved areas, and, further, that we be allowed to retain control of at least five square miles of land (at a point on the slopes of Kinangop to be pointed out by Legalishu. and Masakondi), whereat we. can carry out our circumcision rites and ceremonies, in accordance with the custom of our ancestors.We ask, as a most important point in this arrangement, that the Government will establish and maintain a station on Laikipia, and that officers whom we know and trust may be appointed to look after us there.Also that the Government will pay reasonable compensation for any Masai cultivation at present existing near Nairobi.In conclusion, we wish to state that we are quite satisfied with the foregoing arrangement, and we bind ourselves and our successors, as well as our people, to observe them.We would, however, ask that the settlement now arrived at shall be enduring so long as the Masai as a race shall exist, and that European or other settlers shall not be allowed to take up land in the Settlements.In confirmation of (his Agreement, which has been read and fully explained to us, we hereby set our marks against our names as under:  Lenana,, Son of Mbatian, Lybon of all the Masai.Masakondi, Son of Aruriu, Lybon at Naivasha.

APPENDIX XExtracts from Official Reports concerning the Effects of the Present (1933) Drought(Referring to section 1991 of the Report.) KIKUYU PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated 13(7/ June, 1933, from DistrictCom in commissioner, Nyeri. In South Nyeri the position is briefly as follows:   (a) No mortality worth mention has occurred in the native stock. (6) Tho condition of grazing could hardly be worse: it is eatc-u down to the ground or dried up and withered.(c) Natives are feeding banana stems extensively to their stock to supplement grazing.(d) There is no milk supply at all.Extract from a report dated 21st June, 1933, from Agricultural Officer, Fort Hall.In all the higher locations the grazing, though drying up badly, is adequate for the present.In the lower locations the position is more serious, particularly in Ndamaiyu&apos;s. No deaths of stock due to starvation have been reported, but it is thought that, even if good rains fall in the near-future, the grass has suffered too much to make any rapid growth, and the grazing will be inadequate to support the head of stock. If the rains do not break, soon and no stock are moved from this location, the mortality will be very heavy.The position in Kigwaine&apos;s, though not so serious as in Ndamaiyu&apos;s location, is causing grave concern, and unless good rains-fall within tho next few weeks, mortality of stock will be considerable.In the intermediate locations, as Waweru&apos;s, the position though less serious is sufficient to cause some concern.Extract from a report dated 17th June, 1933, from District Commissioner, Kiambu.There is at present a serious shortage of grazing in this reserve and the situation is aggravated considerably by the lack of water in the Ndeiya grazing area.Up to the present no extensive mortality has been reported but when the stock is in poor condition as at present, it is usual for some enzootic disease or other to take hold and cause serious mortality.Erom what I have seen of this reserve, I am left with the impres-sion that it must be seriously overstocked even in normal seasons.
appendix x-contd.Extract from a report dated 26th June, 1933, from district commissioner, Embu. In this district to date there has been no mortality amongst stock of a serious nature.It can be said thai there is no fear of a serious mortality as yet.Report dated 26th June, 1933, from the District Commissioner, Meru.Grazing in this district is rapidly becoming scarce and a serious shortage will undoubtedly be felt by native stock-owners in the near future.No mortality lias as yet occurred.MASAI PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated loth June, 1933, from District Commissioner, Narok.The present state of this district is drier than I have ever seen it at the end of the dry weather. Tho furrow which supplies Narok Station with water is dry, and rivers such as the Mara are reduced to the merest trickles.Grazing is almost non-existent.Up to date there has, I think, been very little mortality among the stock from starvation, but this is now beginning and if we only get 3.9 inches of rain within the next four months (which is the aver-age rainfall for the months of July, August, September and October over a period of ten years) I am afraid the mortality amongst stock will be very considerable.Rain has fallen in tho Trans Mara country and I do not anticipate that this area will suffer from the drought.Extract from a report dated 14th June, 1933, from District Commissioner, Kajiado.Tlie stock of this district are generally speaking still in fair condition owing to good rains in January, grazing, however, is become-ing scarce throughout the district.Mortality from starvation is expected to increase steadily up to a figure of at least two thousand a month until the arrival of the short rains.Extract from a report dated 23rd June, 1933, from the Acting Provincial Commissioner, Ngong.A deputation has been received to-day from the Kekonyukie living in the neighbourhood of Weikei and the Kedong.They state that their grazing is becoming so exhausted owing to the drought, that heavy mortality amongst their cattle is expected.
APPENDIX X-contd.KAMBA PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated IQth June, 1933, from district commissioner, Mnchahos. The effects of tho drought upon grazing in most of the locutions of the Ulu Reserve are becoming serious, but at the moment I do not anticipate that there will be much general mortality among stock due to starvation.Large numbers of cattle have been and are still being moved to the Yatta, where grazing is plentiful . . .Extract from a report dated 12th June, 1933, from District Co mm ission e r, Kitui.So far no information has been received of the mortality of any stock in the Kitui Reserve duo to the drought, but there is a decided shortage of grazing . . .I am, however, emphatically of the opinion that the district is not normally overstocked, nor are the people wealthy in cattle or goats.NORTHERN FRONTIER PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated 27th June, 1933, from Provincial Commissiojier.At the moment the Leroki Plateau area is as bare as it was in 1929 and I am in the same position as was Mr. R. W. Hemsted then in being compelled to allow the Samburu cattle to graze on the south bank of the Uaso. Naturally, I have not allowed their villages to cross. Though the losses in cattle at the moment are not too heavy, they will probably become exceedingly so as the drought continues. It is true that such mortality aids overstocking but I doubt if the Samburu have more stock than necessary for their existence, due regard being given to the nature of the ar-ea in which they have to live. I wish that the Land Commission could visit it now.TURKANA PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated ISth July, 1933, from the ProvincialCommissio ner.When mortality amongst stock is caused by lack of grazing, it reduces the head to a number which is always slightly in excess of the carrying capacity of the pasture available at the time. This number increases if the pasture improves and so the evils of over-grazing remain, and the improvement which wilt be of short duration gives place eventually to even more deplorable conditions than those obtaining before . . . It is only when stock are killed off by disease (sec recent reports by Professor Swynncrton on the tsetse fly&quot;) to such an extent that their numbers drop considerably below the grazing capacity of &quot;the area that the pasturage is given the chance to recover . . .  We must therefore expect a very serious depreciation of
APPENDIX X-contd.the grazing in Turkana during the next few years. This if unchecked will gradually cause to set in the desert conditions which are already to be observed in some parts of Turkana and compel the remaining population to concentrate on the banks of the rivers . . . Have we any reason to suppose that the forces of nature which gave rise to tho Sahara and caused the once pastoral peoples who inhabited that area, to pass in the course of many generations into the fellahin of Egypt and the Lower Nile will not continue to act in the same manner?If we accept this principle then we must:  (a) Hasten the process of agriculturization and lessen the hard-ship of the transitional stage.(b) Take active steps against these processes by reconditioningand control of stock.Whichever we do, nature will in the end win.Extract from a report dated 20th June, 1933, from District Commissioner, West Suk.I have just returned from a safari to Sook location which is one of the main cattle locations in this district, and it was appalling to see the condition of all cattle, specially the young cows and heifers which at this time of the year should have had good grazing for the past six weeks and be in fair condition.Since the last rains in 1932, there has only been one shower and I fail to see any grass whatsoever on the pla&apos;ns. Cattle that were being herded on the plains were feeding on busb.es and weeds, and in certain parts there were no edible weeds and bushes and the natives were seen to be cutting the branches of trees which were devoured by their stock. Most of the grass on the hill-sides had already been consumed, but I noticed a little in places which were inaccessible to stock. Sheep are also in very poor condition, but the goats appeared all to be thriving.The mortality in the stock locations of this district have been estimated by the natives at 60 per cent, but I am inclined to think this is exaggerated and an estimate of 35 per cent would be nearer tho figure.Report dated 2Sth June, 1933, from the District Commissioner,South Turkana.My general impression after a three weeks safari, just completed, in the Karpedde area, is that from a third to a half of cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys have died; camels have been spared to a very great extent.   Some natives have lost even a larger proportion.I would say that the rest of the district has suffered even heavier losses, all stock-except camels are in very poor condition, and if rains do not fall soon the mortality will exceed 75 per cent to 80 per cent.
APPENDIX X-contd.It is harder to say what effect the drought will have on grazing; grass roots are left in areas where grass grows, and given good rains, not too heavy but general, they will spring up again; as however most of the so-called &quot;grazing&quot; is shrub and bushes, with general rains it will recover.Extract from a report dated 8th July, 1933, from the District Commissioner, North Turkana. The drought this year is the worst within living memory of the oldest members of the tribe, and the search for grazing and water has driven the Turkuua northwards and westwards, to such an extent that the southern and eastern parts of the district are to all intents and purposes depopulated.Grazing, iu the accepted sense of the word as meaning &quot;grass&quot; is now practically non-existent except for scattered and dried up patches . . .What may be described as camel and goat grazing remains in a limited and much reduced quantity, and is steadily deteriorating. This consists of edible thorn, small shrubs, and scrub.Many water-holes have dried up, and what poor grazing remains, is in certain areas, useless owing to lack of water.Large quantities of cattle, sheep and goats, have already died from starvation ... I should estimate (the losses) at not less than twenty per cent of the total stock owned by Turkana in this district.RIFT VALLEY PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated IS th June, 1933, from the ProvincialCommissioner.Baringo District (Kamasia, Njemps and Suk) is a complete desert.The only feed is thorn threes and bushes.The cattle mortality is very heavy, and the ground round the bo mas&apos; is strewn with carcasses.It is impossible to estimate Che mortality, but it may easily reach 50 per cent.Extract from a report dated 11th June, 1933. from the Distriet Commissioner, Baringo. I estimate that more than half the cattle in Baringo District have died, quite qossibly more. If the drought continues probably nearly three-quarters of the cattle will die. The condition of sheep is bad, and there is a heavy mortality here also, possibly ;&quot;0 per cent. Goats are standing the strains better, but here again there is considerable loss.   Young stock of all kinds are dying through lack of milk.
6APPENDIX X-comtri.NZOIA PROVINCE. Extract from a report dated 26th June, 1933, from the ProvincialCommissioner.Iii the Elgeyo portion of the reserve the mortality owing to drought has been heavy. Some owners have lost up to 50 per cent of their stock: and I estimate that in the grazing area lying on the plateau between Sergait rook and the Tambach escarpment about 15 per cent of the cattle have died.Shortage of water rather than lack of grazing has been mainly responsible for the mortality.There have been no losses from drought in the Cherangani area.Rain has fallen in the Elgeyo area during the last week: and conditions there will probably improve from now onwards.In the Nandi Eeserve a belt of about six miles wide on the eastern boundary suffered from shortage of grazing for about a month, owing mainly to injudicious burning of grass. There was a slight mortality till rain fell on 24th April, since when there has been ampleExtract from a report dated 24th June, 1933, from ProvincialGommissio tier.I have had replies from all District Commissioners which confirm my own opinion that no part of the province is at present overstocked and no mortality has occurred amongst cattle owing to drought.But if the question of overstocking is leading up to that of culling I would like to state again that I consider a very large number of inferior stock should be culled and I am in favour of it being done compulsorily. We want to build up the native herds by keeping -only selected animals and all &quot;weeds&quot; should be done away with and so leave more grazing for better beasts.
APPENDIX XIFigures showing Results Obtainable in Bush Clearing by Organized Native Labour(The reference is to Section 2021 of the Report.)The undermentioned facts are of interest with regard to what eoulci be achieved if natives were induced to turn out in large numbers in their reserves for the purpose of clearing bush for the improvement of pasture and the destruction of fly. They are based on actual results obtained in clearing land of the light thorn scrub which is typical of that which obtains in most of the semi-arid native areas.One man (after he has had time to get accustomed to the work) can dig out 1-10 trees to a depth of 14 inches as his day&apos;s work, and finish by 1 p.m.On this basis, five men would clear an acre of typical bush country in one day.If 1,000 men were turned out daily they could clear 250 acres per diem, or a total of 50,000 acres iu 250 working days. It is, of course, unlikely that results such ns this would be obtained in a native reserve, where conditions as to supervision, etc., cannot be fairly compared with those obtaining on a private estate, but the figures do show what real and appreciable results should be obtained from organized effort in bush clearing.
607APPENDIX XIIDetails of the Figures given in the Table at Section 1966, shcw-ing Areas Included in the 1928 Sub-Committee&apos;s Definition of the European Highlands, but now Recommended to be Excluded.1. Kikuyu.Item (i). 13,781 acres? of forest reserve. This figure is the sum of the items 1-0 and 10-1-1 of the table at Section 466.Item (ii). 2,480 acres of mission land. This figure is the sum of the items 15 and 16 of the table at Section 466, plus L.O. 388/1, 400 acres surrendered by the Africa Inland Mission Section 463 (i).Item (iii). 50 acres of township reserve. This figure represents item 19 of the table at Section 406.Item (iv). 1,828 acres of alienated farms. This figure is the sum of items 7, 17, and 18 of the table at Section 460.Item (v). 2,002 acres of unaliehated Crown land. This figure is the sum of items 8 and 9 of the table at Section 466, plus L.O. 4450, 440 acres--see Section 463 (i).Note. The Mwea area is not included in this tabulation, because it was not included in the Sub-Committeo&apos;s amended definition (sec Section 1958).2.-Masai.Item (i). 9.290 acres of forest reserve. See Section 695, (N.B. Of the area there recommended to be added to the Masai, 9,290 acres are forest reserve, the remaining 4,762 acres being unalienated Crown lands.)Item (ii). 230 acres of alienated Crown land. Part of Mr. Col-vile&apos;s farm (see Section 697).Item (iii). 4,762 acres of unalienated Crown laud. Sec Section 695, and note on item (i) above.3. Kamba.Item (i). 100 acres of alienated farm land. Ngalini Farm (see Section 773).Item (ii). 720 acres of unalienated Crown land. Mwani Hill [see Section 775).4. Kerio.Item (i). 3,850 acres of forest reserve. See Section 1007 (Area D).Item (ii). 213,518 acres of unalienated Crown land. Cburo, reckoned as .140 square miles (see Section 939); 100 square mites ad-joining the Njemps country (see Sections 942 and 969); 74 square mites recommended to be evacuated by the Uasin Gishu Masai and added to the Kerio Native Reserve (see Section 967); 12 square miles of the Cherangani extension (sec Section 1020); 920 acres, L.O. 1168 (see Section 970); 1,129 acres, Area E (Section 1007); and 2,829 aeres
APPENDIX XII-contd.of L.O. 1809 (Section 1009). The total of these areas is 326 square miles and 4,878 acres. In order to express the whole in acres, the 326 square miles have been taken to represent exactly 208,640 acres, although the areas arc not so precisely determined that a statement iu acres is, strictly speaking, admissible. After adding in the remaining 4,878 acres, the total becomes 213,518 acres.5. Nandi.Item. 1,920 acres of imalienated Crown land. Exclusion caused by the amendment of the Coglc lane as recommended (see Section 1068).6. Lumbua.item. 94,90D acres of unalienated Crown land. In Section 1170, il is recommended that Chepalungu be added to the Lumbwa Native Reserve, except tor 10,000 acres, which remain in the European High-lands. At Section .1168, the total area of Chepalungu is given as approximately 164 square miles. The total of 9,4,960 has been obtained by multiplying 164 by 640, and deducting 10,000. It must, however, be &quot;remembered that the true area has not been precisely ascertained, and the margin of error is considerable.7. Kavirondo.Item. 4,500 acres of unalienated Crown land. At Section 1087 (8) it is recommended that some 40,000 acres of moorland on Mount Elgon be added to the Kavirondo Native lleserve. Of this area, some 4,500 acres are at present included in the Trans Nzoia administrative district, and so fall within the Sub-Committee&apos;s definition of the European Highlands. The recommendation woidd have the effect of excluding these 4.500 acres from the European Highlands.8. Northern Frontier Province. Item. 104,000 acres of unalienated Crown land. At Section 810 it is recommended that the Muhogodo area be detached from the Ivikuyu Province and added to the Northern Frontier Province for the purpose of administration, and that it should be an area in which natives should have prior but not exclusive rights. Hence it is shown , as excluded from the European Highlands.In the above section it is stated that the determination of the area should be left to Government. In order to avoid compromising the issue, the area shown on the map for diagrammatic purposes has been drawn so as to split the difference equally between the two principal proposals, and the area in tho table corresponds with the diagram. It is obvious, however, that the margin of error is very large.
APPENDIX XIIIRecommendations Involving Direct Expenditure(Referring to section 2041 of the Report.) 1. The purchase of land.Item (i). At section 460 it is recommended that the following ireas bo purchased or acquired by exchange: -(a) Part of L.O. 325/R, Saba-Saba, Ltd.......   1,000 acres(b) L.O. 295/2/R        ......      .........       80(c) The eastern end of L.O. 134/4 .........      250   ,,(d) Part of British East Africa Wattle Estate     ...       76   ,,Total   ...   1,408 acresSince the cost of acquisition would clearly form the subject of negotiation between Government and the owners, we shall refrain from setting down any figure as an estimate, for fear of prejudicing the transactions, lint we take these items into account in reaching our estimate of the total cost of our recommendations, which will be found at the cud of this appendix.The same remarks apply to other items below, for which we give no separate estimate.Item (ii). At section 1068 a recommendation is made for a modification of the Cogle line involving the acquisition of three farms on the south-west corner of the allotment. Two of the three farms belong to one owner, who is willing to exchange them for land of equal value in the block marked Sarora, while the owner of the third farm has expressed his readiness to exchange il for unalienated Crown land in the North Nyeri District. No direct expenditure of money is involved, except possibly for incidental costs of survey.Item (hi). At sections 1254, 1255 it is recommended that Wundanyi Estate, 128S acres, be purchased for addition to the P)abida native reserve, and at section 1253 it is stated that the price asked is  5,000.2. Compensation to natives in respect of their rights under section 86 of the Crown Lands Ordinance. At section 367 it is recommended that 62,000 should be paid in respect of compensation to Kikuyu for loss of rights to land outside the reserve.3. Compensation to detribalized or detached natives in respect of their removal from areas in which they are at present resident. Item (i). At section 398, read in conjunction with section 395, it is recommended that the natives to be moved from Tigoni be com-pensated in a manner which would include: compensation for ordinary round hut in the form of exemption from one year&apos;s.tax on the hut; cash compensation ad valorem for a better class hut or house ; com-pensation for planted trees (i.e. gums and wattles) at a cash valuation;
APPENDIX XIII-contd.compensation for wire fencing, if any, at a cash valuation. Tlio num-ber of persons living in Tigoni is stated in section 389 to bo G07. according to a count made in 1932.Item (ii). At section 399 it is recommended that Kilhirioni, an area of seventy acres, bo treated in the same way as Tigoni.Item (iii). At section 591 (7) it is recommended that Pangaui village, Nairobi, bo evacuated by sections. At section ;&apos;.8S tho number of bouses is stated to be 320; at section 591 (1) tho opinion is expressed that  15 may be an approximate estimate of the average value of a house, and at section 591 (ii) it is recommended that com-pensation should be allowed for disturbance as well as for tho value of the houses.Item (iv). At sections 003 and 606-008 we have made alternative proposals regarding Kibira settlement, Nairobi, and have, expressed the general opinion that the second of them is preferable. In reach-ing our total estimate of costs we have assumed that the second alternative will be adopted. This will entail compensation for 320 houses ad valorem and compensation for disturbance as slated in the section under reference.Item (v). At section 923 it is recommended that the TJasin Gishu Masai be moved to the Trans-Mara area. The incidental costs should not be large, and only a small token sum has been included in our estimate.4. Compensation to certain Dorobo in respect of their proposedremoval.Item (i). At section 375 a recommendation is made which would involve the movement of certain Dorobo living in the forests adjacent to the Kikuyu Native Reserve, mainly in the Kijabe area. It is recom-mended that the Administration should charge itself with the task of finding accommodation for them, and incidental monetary costs should be very small.Item (ii). At section 9S2 it is recommended that, in order to facilitate the move of the Mau Dorobo, their stock might be ex-changed, through Government, for immune animals. An amount has been set down in our estimate to cover any incidental losses in con-nexion with this and other arrangements in connexion with moving the Mau and Tinet Dorobo.Item (iii). At section 10S6 it is recommended that the El Gonyi be moved and that all those who have res&apos;ded in the farm area con-tinuously for a period of three years should receive compensation. The total number of El Gonyi reported to be in the farm area is about 1,900 (sec section 1079).5. Compensation to the Nandi Tribe in respect of Certain Stand Prcmia which were ivaived in Kiplcarren and Kaimosi.At Section 1067, it is recommended that compensation of  5,000 be paid.
APPENDIX XII I contd.6. The Poncing of Clicmatum Salt-lick (see Sections 1153 and 1154). Tho length of: fencing required has been estimated by the Survey Department to be about 2] miles of fencing (allowing for fencing round tho salt-lick and both sides of the road of access). The Chief Veterinary Officer advises that the capital cost should be about  oO a mile, and the recurrent annual cost about 15 per cent of the capital cost.7. The Upkeep of the Small Furrow to the Morania Farrow. At Section 569, it is recommended that Government should meet the full cost of the supply-furrow to the Morania furrow, both in respect of initial cost and maintenance. A perusal of the Public, Works Department files shows that in 1927 the Meru Local Native Council contributed  100 towards the costs and, according to the recommendation, them would be a liability to reimburse the Meru for this sum. It is believed that the cost of maintenance will be about  50 per annum.8. The Leasing of Certain Farms for the Kamasia. At Section 968, it it recommended that Government should open negotiations for leasing farms Nos. 488, 489, 490, 5249, 5276, 6202, 5461, and 493, comprising some twenty-three square miles, for a period of ten years, and allow the Kamasia to use them.9. Rent of the King&apos;8 African Rifles Lines at Meru. This is a recurrent cost, which may perhaps be in the region of  20 per annum or thereabouts.10. The Re-creation of the Office of Recorder of Titles. No recommendation has been made as to the salary of the post, aud the sum which we have allowed for the purposes of making an estimate is set down without any wish to prejudice the issue. It is assumed that  1,200 per annum will cover salary and other emolu-ments.Total Cost.It is estimated that the capital cost of these items would be about  36,000 (the whole ten years&apos; rental under Head 8 being re-garded as a capital charge). The recurrent annual charges are estimated at , lr300.Cost of the Commission. The cost of tho Commission has not been included in the above figures, which deal ouly with the cost pf the recommendations. As nearly as can be ascertained at the time of writing, the total cost of the Commission, apart from the cost of printing and publishing the Report, is  5,950.
