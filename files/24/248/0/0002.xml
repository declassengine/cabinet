DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC liAJSSTY^S GOVERNliSNT.COPY NO.CABINET,. JAPANESE TRADE COMPETITION, Note by the President of the Board of Trade.The prospects of the negotiations between United Kingdom and Japanese cotton and rayon industrialists, which opened here nearly a month ago, are not bright.      It is possible that the talks may break down - mainly on the question of their geographical scope.      Our people say that any arrangement reached must cover the markets of the world, except India (which is being covered by Indo-Japcne se governmental negotiations. The Japanese want to confine it to our Home and Colonial marketsa The discussions on Wednesday last reached a deadlock but after consulting me the Lancashire representatives prepared a fresh note which offers a way out of the impasse ii the Japanese care to accept it, and we can only hope that they will do scIf a breakdown occurs there will be an immediate outcry for rapid action by the Government.      We shall be urged to denounce (at twelve months&apos; notice)   our Commercial Treaty with Japan;    to exclude,  so far as possible during the expiry of the notice, Japanese goods from this country and our Colonies; and to press the Dominions and foreign countries to take similar measures.      In other words, we shall be asked to embark on what amounts to a commercial war with Japan, with the help of such allies as we can muster.The adoption of such a policy might involve serious consequences, economic as veil as political;    and I  should like to feel that in the event of a breakdown ox the present industrial67(54).-1-
negotiations I could have, without delay, the assistance of those of my colleagues whose Departments are most directly concerned (the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies)  so that the position could he considered from all points of view,I suggest, therefore, that a committee should he set up, to he called together whenever it may he found necessary.V/.R.Board of Trade,9th March,  1934.
