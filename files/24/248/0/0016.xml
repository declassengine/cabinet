Copy No.42CP. 80 (34).CABINET.IMPERIAL DEFENCE POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.        .1\ &quot;.THE Cabinet on the 14th March (Cabinet 9 (34), Conclusion 13) asked me to take part in preparing &apos;&apos; recommendations for improving our relations with Japan.&quot; In the course of the discussion the suggestion was thrown out of an Anglo-Japanese non-aggression pact. The following points suggest themselves in this connexion, and I record and circulate them at once to save time. The paper does not, of course, profess to cover the whole ground indicated by the Cabinet, and departmental consultations will be carried on as soon as possible. -2.   Pros and Cons Pros. The pact might give some comfort to Japan as an assurance- .(1) that we would not be an ally of the United States in a war against Japam Just possibly, but not probably, this might tend to moderate her naval demands:(2) that she would have a somewhat freer hand in dealing with Russia;    :l (3) that our feelings were generally friendly and were intended to become more so.Cons. The effect on the United States would unquestionably be bad, since the conclusion of a non-aggression pact with Japan would be regarded as a first step in a return to the policy of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It would be argued in the United States that the existence of the Kellogg Pact rendered a pact of non-aggression technically unnecessary a view hitherto accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, e.g., in answer to Turkey so that its only purpose must be political. A political understanding designed to improve Anglo-Japanese relations and to raise the prestige of the Power universally regarded as America&apos;s principal enemy must obviously come as a shock to the Government and people of the United States. The moment for administering such a shock might not be well-timed before the Naval Conference of 1935, though the idea might become possible during the Conference. (See below.) This need not in itself deter His Majesty&apos;s Government from the policy contemplated, for, with the possible exception of the period covered by Mr. Hoover&apos;s administration, there has been no marked increase in America&apos;s readiness to collaborate helpfully with this country since the denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. But that an impairment in Anglo-American relations- would result cannot be open to doubt. A tripartite pact of non-aggression British Commonwealth-Japan-United States would, of course, be another matter, but would hardly serve the purposes for which the present suggestion was made.In this connexion it should be borne in mind that the decision to terminate the Alliance was in the last resort due to a desire to propitiate Canadian opinion rather than American opinion.China would certainly regard it as a demonstration that, so far as we-were concerned, Japan might have a free hand against her. Incidentally, the League of Nations Union would-be-likely-to-take-it amiss- as-a-condonation of Japanese proceedings in Manchukuo.7320   [9804]
Russia would preVumabiyvfeel in&apos;milder form somewhat the same as China. More generally, she would doubt the sincerity of our previously-expressed dislike of multiplying pacts which in substance add nothing to the Kellogg Pact. Turkey, to whom we have directly stated such dislike, would be similarly surprised, and it might be difficult to avoid being drawn into a pact involving Russia, Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan, which has been repeatedly pressed upon us, and repeatedly declined.There is weight on both sides of the argument, but, on the whole, the balance seems to incline on the side of the &quot; cons.&quot; The &quot; pros &quot; are not really very solid when analysed. The Japanese are careful thinkers and, while susceptible to friendly advances from us, might conclude that no solid assets are gained by an ad hoc repetition of the Kellogg Pact.3. It seems doubtful whether the pact is necessary for the object in view. The Japanese are quite clearly anxious for good relations. A consistent policy of regard for their feelings and interests will therefore carry full weight with them. The Japanese Government seem as anxious as we are to solve the trade competition difficulty in a friendly spirit, and the pact would probably do little to help us in this connexion. They have refused a non-aggression pact proposed to them by Russia and might be slightly embarrassed in their relations with that country if they concluded a similar pact with us.: .4. As things stand, Japan is demanding naval parity with the British Commonwealth of Nations. The view of our Admiralty is that Japan, far from hoping to increase her relative naval strength, must be content with a ratio in cruiser strength slightly inferior to that accorded by the London Naval Treaty. So&apos; complete a deadlock cannot be overcome by means of a non-aggression pact particularly if we pay our price before the bargaining begins. In fact, the conclusion of such a pact without reference to the impending naval negotiations would probably prove to be merely a &quot; flash in the pan.&quot; If the policy of the non-aggression pact is considered otherwise desirable, the best course would probably be to keep it in reserve pending the progress of the naval negotiations. If at a later stage it were found that Japan might be induced to accept a lower ratio of naval strength in return for a non-aggression pact with this country and possibly also with the United States the proposal might then serve a useful and practical purpose.5. If such an offer were to be made it would be necessary to consider the following points, most of which would still be relevant even if the offer were only made at.the time of the Naval Conference : -v,(a) What would be the form of such a pact? One important matter to . i r decide would be the parties to it, especially as some of the Dominionsare intimately concerned. Presumably the United Kingdom .., Government could not contract for them, though our own adhesion j/ would cover Hong Kong and other Crown Colonies.   Then would theparties be the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Japan ? Or would Canada be included? Or would the instrument, by appropriate signatures, be made to cover the whole British Empire? Presumably the international settlement at Shanghai or the British concessions elsewhere in China could not be covered. ... (b) Is not Japan likely to require that other matters in actual or prospective controversy between us should also be settled before such a pact is signed e.g., the trade controversy and the Naval Agreement? Or would there be a prospect of bringing about such a pact as a preliminary to the discussion and settlement of these other matters? Japan might stipulate that we should recognise Manchukuo and Japanese claims on the mainland, or should give an assurance not to -       interfere.&quot; j. s.,,!;i/Jffl,fcA. 16M1934,
