(Clause 3(3)  ).(a) It will be illegal for employers to pay less than the rates of wages in an Order and payment at lower rates will be subject to penalty. It will be for the operatives or their organisations to take action.(b) The provisions of an Order must be kept exhibited in places of work and records kept of wages paid.Renewal.   (Clause 4)Renewal of an Order may be obtained by notice within two months of the expiry of an Order and,  if there are no objections, the Order may be renewed.      If there are objections, the above procedure must be followed as for a new Order.Expenses.

Otherwise the cost will fall upon the parties and those who seek to enforce payment of the rates under an Order.Scope.        (Clause 6 and Schedule).The Bill will apply to the weaving of cotton and
rayon and preparatory and incidental operations carried on in Lancashire and certain surrounding districts.      No difficulty is  anticipated in defining this sccpe and area as soon as I am free to settle the details with the organisations concerned.It will he seen that the Bill places the minimum of responsibility for action on the Minister of Labour and that he will be in no way responsible for the settlement of the rates of wages to be enforced.(Intld. )      H.B.25rd March,  1954.
