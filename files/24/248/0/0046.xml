Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.SECRET. Copy No.cp. 110 (34).CABINET.MALTA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I THINK it necessary that I should circulate to the Cabinet the attached despatches from the Governor of Malta and ask for their decision.2. The first despatch raises a difficult question. The Governor strongly urges that an Imperial Act should be passed abolishing the Malta Constitution. The present position in the Island is that, in pursuance of the decision taken by the Cabinet last autumn, Parliamentary Government is temporarily suspended under a provision in the Constitution itself. This provision enables us to take over the administration provided that the Secretary of State is satisfied that a grave emergency exists. The Governor now argues that the present provisional regime should be placed upon a permanent and regular basis. This entails the abolition of the Constitution, which can only be effected by an Act of Parliament. I agree with the Governor that it would be impossible to restore the Constitution of Malta in its old form. There are, from the purely local standpoint, undoubtedly strong arguments for acceding to the Governors proposal, and although I see great practical difficulties in giving effect to it at this end, I think it is only right that the main points of the local case should be set out for the Cabinet&apos;s considera-tion.  They are as follows : (1) The Parliamentary institutions granted to Malta in 1921 have been given a fair trial and have failed. Their temporary suspension last year was generally welcomed in Malta. The overwhelming majority of the population are at present in favour of Crown Colony Government. But this popularity will die down as the misdeeds of Ministers are forgotten and the criticism to which all Govern-ments are heirs increases. If we are to take action, therefore, the present time is propitious.(2) If the present goodwill towards the Crown Colony regime is to be retained, it is essential that we should pursue an active and progressive policy in our administration of the Island. The Crown Colony administrations of the past have never been sufficiently constructive. For 100 years we have, by our expenditure on the Fighting Services, provided a more prosperous economic basis for the Island than it could otherwise have expected. This economic prosperity has of itself created, among those who by virtue of it have been able to reach a certain standard of culture and civilisation, a demand for progressive administra-tion. Parliamentary Government having failed, they are quite content to accept a Crown Colony regime provided it makes an active attempt to satisfy their aspirations. There is undoubtedly a good deal to be done in the Island in the way of improving agriculture, education, the public health services, communications and so on. But if this work is to be carried out on a scale which will really satisfy public opinion, we must be able to make fairly long-range plans. How can we do this in the present conditional and transitory state of things? There is no certainty as to what is going to happen in the next year or two. It is, therefore, difficult for those in charge of the administration to pursue with confidence a long-range policy. Under present conditions whatever they do may be undone within a short time, and the uncertainty breeds a general disinclination to take
constructive action. The Maltese officials, on whose efforts we must mainly rely, are thinking of what may happen when the present regime is altered and. they have a new set of masters.(3) If Crown Colony Government does not pursue an active policy, it will gradually lose prestige. The incessant propaganda of a small group of politicians who have a vested interest in responsible government, but at present have little popular support, will become more and more effective. The temporary nature of the present Government is a considerable encouragement to their attacks. The politicians who control the Press cannot run the risk of giving any continued support to the present administration. They are afraid that the Constitution may be restored; and they are naturally anxious to be in a position, if it is restored, to claim the credit for having got it back. If it could be made plain that the present regime has come to stay, it is probable that most of the politicians would abandon the attack as hopeless. It is also likely that some of the news-papers, which are financed for political objects, would be abandoned as a bad investment. It is contended that it would not sufficiently meet this point for further statements to be made in Parliament here that Parliamentary govern-ment will not be restored in Malta. It would be thought that a merely executive decision of this sort would no doubt be altered. It must be remembered that all that is required to restore Parliamentary government is a simple declaration in the Gazette that the emergency has ceased to exist. So long as the restoration can be effected so simply, the islanders will think that there is a chance that Ministerial government may return. If, however, the Constitution were formally abolished by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, it would be felt that definite and permanent action had been taken, and that the whole question of the constitutional future had been decided and closed.(4) The Governor argues that though the present &quot; emergency&quot; form of government may be valid in law, there is in fact in Malta no emergency in any reasonable sense of the term, and that the fact must, therefore, be faced that the Government reposes upon a legal fiction. This has a bad effect locally, is detrimental to our prestige and inconsistent with the dignity of the Imperial Government.(5) Apart from this consideration, the question arises how far we can fairly continue to say that a grave emergency exists to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State. This matter is referred to in the memorandum attached to the despatch, which has the authority of Sir Alison Russell, an experienced lawyer, whom I appointed specially to the post of Legal Adviser. He states that the matter is one of great difficulty, since powers which are strictly temporary powers exercisable in a time of grave emergency are being stretched, in his submission, beyond the limit of their contemplated exercise.(6) There are further legal difficulties, which are dealt with in the memoranda attached to the despatch.   Examples may be cited : (a) A provision of the Constitution provides that there be a Session of theLegislature at least once a year. We are assuming that this provision only operates when there is a Legislature in being, which is not the case at present. But the question is doubtful; and the local lawyers hold the view that, if the matter could be brought before the local Court, the Court would express the opinion that the failure of the Governor to take steps for the holding of an election and a meeting of the Legislature before the expiration of twelve months from the last Session was unconstitutional.(b) The Constitution provides for the constitution of a Trade Union council with the object of electing two representatives to the Senate. The law appears to require that action should be taken annually for the election of members to this Council. But if we do not mean to restore the Senate, it is obviously futile and mischievous to set in action part of the machinery for its election.(c) The Constitution also requires an annual registration of voters for theelection of members of the Legislature. But the last thing we want to do is to encourage the idea that there will be a general election.We are, in fact, assuming that our powers cover all these matters. I have approved the enactment of an Ordinance suspending the revision of the Register, and it will probably become necessary to suspend action for constituting a new
Trade Union Council. We shall, of course, not summon the Legislature. But there is always the risk that our action may be challenged in the Courts; and I am advised there is little doubt that a Maltese Court will decide against us if it can find grounds for doing so.3. The above are the arguments in favour of abolishing the Constitution; and I think it is desirable for me to add a word to explain why this can only be done by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. Malta is a conquered Colony and, therefore, the Crown has a common law prerogative to legislate for it and to provide for and to alter its Constitution. But if the Crown once grants self-government, it cannot revoke that grant unless it has reserved the power to do so. When the Constitution was granted in 1921 the Crown, in the Letters Patent setting up the new form of government, did not reserve power to revoke the grant; and it was because of this that it was necessary to go to Parliament in 1932 in order to effect certain alterations in the Constitution. In order to give effect to the Governor&apos;s proposal, all that is necessary would be to put the Crown back into its position prior to 1921. It has been suggested to me that the Bill might simply take the form of providing that the King shall have in Malta the same power and jurisdiction as though the Malta Constitution Act of 1932 had not been passed, and the Malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 had contained a clause reserving to Plis Majesty the power to revoke, alter or amend the Letters Patent. It will thus be seen that on the face of it the Bill could be presented as a technical measure and would not in terms provide for the &quot; abolition of the Constitution.&quot; Such phraseology, which somewhat suggests the destruction of time-honoured representative institutions, would indeed be somewhat out of place in the case of Malta, which has enjoyed with considerable interruptions its limited form of self-government only since 1921.4. I am bound to add that the officer whom I sent specially to Malta from the Colonial Office, and who knows the people well and is a shrewd judge, shares the Governors views and considers that, looked at as a Malta problem, there is a strong case for doing what the Governor asks.5. From our domestic point of view, the proposed course would be very awkward. Legislation in the present Session is a practical impossibility. We could, no doubt, find time next Session. But my colleagues will hardly relish the prospect of introducing a Bill to perpetuate the destruction of the Malta Constitution concurrently with the India Bill.Granted that the Bill can take the simple form which I have suggested in paragraph 3, we should still be faced with the question : &quot; Why is it necessary to introduce a Bill at all ? &quot; That is naturally the first question the House of Commons would put about any Bill. The true answer would be that we want once and for all to abolish Parliamentary Government in Malta. I should very much like to give that answer. And if the Maltese problem could be isolated, I have no doubt that is the right course. But I cannot pretend that critics of the India Bill would not be quick to seize the contrast between India and Malta. I need not elaborate the easy speeches which the least adroit member could make. If that simple and true answer is denied (and who would not detect and expose the truth ?) we are driven back on the defence of questioning the validity of our own actions. Should we not have to admit that the emergency under which we acted is something of a legal fiction, that we stretched our powers to declare an emergency, and that we cannot continue indefinitely to pretend that an emergency exists? But the fact remains that we acted in the same way as the Labour Government acted in 1930, when Parliamentary Government was suspended on the religious issue. No one pretended then that the fortress was in danger. Parliamentary Government was suspended because we could not get a fair election. We maintained that suspension for two years, and only restored Parliamentary Government when we thought the religious controversy had been settled. We suspended Parliamentary Government this time because Ministers were conducting the Government improperly. Is there any reason why, if we had the right so to suspend, we should not continue the suspension indefinitely ?While I appreciate the Governor&apos;s difficulties and accept his view that the abolition of the Constitution by an Imperial Act would be convenient and beneficial in Malta, I must admit that the situation here makes such a course very difficult at the present time.
6. It is conceivable that circumstances may arise which will make an Act imperative. If, for instance, the Malta Courts should give a judgment which impeded the Governor in his administration or in the pursuit of the policy of Crown Colony Government, we should, I think, be bound to legislate on the lines suggested in paragraph 3. But in that event it would be easy to justify such a Bill; and I doubt if, in those circumstances, it would arouse much opposition.7. In the second of the annexed despatches, the Governor puts forward a proposal with which I am in entire agreement. He suggests that an Advisory Council should be set up, composed of five official and eight unofficial members appointed by him. At present, the only body which the Governor has to advise him is the Nominated Council. This is composed of members representative of the Imperial interests in the Island, including the Fighting Services; and they were never intended to deal with the general range of civil affairs. It contains no unofficial members; and its proper function is to advise on matters which normally lie within the &apos;&apos; reserved &apos;&apos; sphere of the Dyarchy.It seems evident that, if we are to have a prolonged period of Crown Colony administration, an advisoiy body of a diffei&apos;ent character must be added to the governmental machinery.    It is obviously desirable to enable the Governor to keep as far as possible in touch with unofficial opinion; and it will be a step in the right direction if we can bring in unofficial members on the new Council, and    I thus piwide him with a definite channel with which he can make contact with it.    1 In Cyprus an informal &apos;&apos; Advisory Council&apos;&apos; has been set up to provide the Governor with a means of ascertaining unofficial views on questions of legislation    I and other matters of importance affecting the relations between the Government and the unofficial community.   I agree with Sir David Campbell that a Council on similar lines will best meet the existing situation in Malta.The proposed Council will have no executive or legislative powers.     Its functions will be purely advisory.     The Governor will be free to accept or disregard its advice as he thinks fit.  It will, as in the case of the Cyprus Council,    j be an informal body, and for the time being at any rate will not be established by law as a part of the regular constitutional machinery.The Governor does not propose to invite any persons who have taken a prominent part in party politics in the past to accept nomination as unofficial    j members.   I feel sure that the Governor^ views on this point are sound.   Malta needs a complete rest from party politics.  It would be a great mistake, by setting    j up a Council of politicians aligned on the old basis, to perpetuate the political feuds of the past.It will be observed that the Governor warns me that the unofficials whom he proposes to approach, or, indeed, any other unofficials, may refuse to serve; and it must be admitted that the uncertainty as to the political future alluded to in the earlier part of this memorandum may increase the possibility of a &quot;non-co-operative &apos;&apos; attitude. Unofficial persons of the type we wish to see on the Council may not be willing to run the risk of the reprisals which might follow upon the restoration of Parliamentary government. But this is a risk which we must take; and I propose to authorise the Governor to sound privately the gentlemen whom he names as to their willingness to serve.(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, April 18, 1934.
annex .Secret Despatch from the Governor of Malta to the Secretary of State for theColonies, February 20, 1934.I HAVE the honour to address you with regard to a question which 1 consider to be one of the most important with which my Administration is at present faced, namely, the constitutional future of Malta. The Provisional Government based upon the &quot;emergency&quot; provision of the Letters Patent has now lasted for nearly four months, and during this time I have gradually been forced to the conclusion that both from the point of view of the political prestige of Great Britain in these islands and of the practical necessities of day-to-day administration the time has come when some more regular and more permanent basis of Government should be provided.2. Your legal advisers are of the opinion that the provisions of Section 41 (1) of the Constitution Letters Patent render legally valid the present form of Government. But, whatever may be the legal position, I am strongly of the opinion that from the broad political point of view the continuance of the Govern-ment on the basis of an emergency carries serious disadvantages and ought to be terminated at the earliest practicable moment. There is, in fact, in Malta no emergency in any reasonable sense of the term, and the fact must be faced that the Government reposes at present on a legal fiction. This position is, I am convinced, having a detrimental effect upon the prestige of the Government. To the popular mind it gives the appearance of having been established by a species of legal sophistry inconsistent with the dignity of the Imperial Authorities.3. Added to this political difficulty in the present system of Government are many practical disadvantages. Although Parliamentary Government has been suspended, the Constitution established by Letters Patent still remains in force. The existence of its provisions has a hampering effect upon adminis-tration, and creates many difficulties in the way of the establishment of that clear-cut and progressive Crown Colony regime which I am convinced is now the fundamental need of Malta.4. So far as the legal position is concerned, I enclose a joint minute by the Legal Adviser and the Treasury Counsel, of the 2nd instant. I also enclose, for convenience of reference, copies of separate minutes by the Legal Adviser and the Treasury Counsel of the 15th February, on the subject of the proposed suspension of the preparation of the electoral lists, which is dealt with in a separate despatch; and a copy of a joint minute by the Legal Adviser and the Treasury Counsel on the subject of the Trade Union Council, which is likewise dealt with in a separate despatch.You will observe that my advisers are not altogether of the same opinion in advising me on this matter, and their embarrassment is increased when they find that they have to express an opinion which differs from the view put forward by your legal adviser. Your legal adviser describes the position as full of doubt and difficulty, and it is certain that it is not possible to express a confident opinion as to the final result of litigation, if litigation should arise. As regards the immediate result of litigation my advisers entertain no doubt that a Malta Court would declare any apparent infraction of the Constitution, either express or implied, to be ultra vires and void, a result which would certainly be undesirable and might lead to trouble.I regard this as a point of considerable importance.As another instance of difficulties which might arise in the future if the present state of affairs from the constitutional point of view were to continue for some time to come, I would mention that it might become desirable, as indicated by me in another despatch, to consider the creation of an Executive Council onSecret (11). Sir,The Palace, Valletta,February 20, 1934.
normal Crown Colony lines in the event of it proving impossible to form an Advisory Council. It would clearly be impracticable for an Executive Council of this nature to be set up within the framework of the present Constitution.5. I do not underrate the difficulties which stand in the way of satisfactory regularization of the position. Presumably an Act of the Imperial Parliament would be required to clear the ground of the existing constitutional machinery; and I fully realize that from your standpoint you may feel reluctant to take the necessary steps to secure the passage through Parliament of a further measure to deal with Malta. In the local interest, however, I feel bound to urge you to give favourable consideration to the possibility of securing the final abolition of the Constitution initiated in 1921. The present moment seems an exceptionally propitious one for action. The suspension of Parliamentary Government appears to have been received with as much general approval in the United Kingdom as it has in Malta itself. There seems no doubt that public opinion here has thoroughly approved the change to Crown Colony regime. As time goes on, however, it is natural to expect that there will be an increasing disposition to criticize the Government. This will be exploited by those who have now acquired a vested interest in the existence of Parliamentary institutions, and it may be expected that a demand for the restoration of the Constitution will be put forward with increasing force. So long as Parliamentary Government can be resumed by a simple Proclamation to the effect that the emergency no longer exists, the expression of such a demand is only natural; and I may mention that only last week the Police removed posters placarded in various towns of the Island by a newspaper, advocating a General Strike for the return of the Constitution. But if, while the defects of the self-governing regime are still fresh in the minds of the population, the Constitution could be abolished and the firm intention of the Imperial Authorities to govern the country were made manifest, I feel sure that action would detract greatly from the motive force behind these demands.6. There is an additional consideration. The definite action which has been taken in recent months with regard to Italian propaganda and the dismissal of the Ministry has created in Malta an impression that the Imperial Authorities intend to take further energetic action. If such action is taken, it will, in my view, do nothing but increase the prestige which has accrued to the present Government from the recent measures. If, on the other hand, the popular expectation is disappointed, I feel that the weakness which will be attributed to the present regime will detract from the support which it is at present receiving, and will continue to receive, provided it displays a resolute determination to govern the country. From every local standpoint, therefore, I feel that there is unlikely to recur a moment at which the abolition of the Constitution could be more propitiously carried out than at present.I have, &amp;c.D. CAMPBELL, Governor.The Right HonourableSir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, G.B.E., &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c.Enclosure I.WE have been asked to state the difficulties which wre encounter in advising the Government under the present circumstances.2. The Constitution under the Letters Patent is not in so many words suspended. The Governor legislates by virtue of the Constitution itself, that is, by the operation of Section 41 (1), as in a grave emergency, and by virtue of Section 12 of the Letters Patent constituting the Office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief.3. The general question has arisen whether the Governor, acting under those powers, can enact legislation which is not in accordance with the Constitution. Upon this point different opinions have been expressed; but we think that there is very little doubt that, if the question came before the Malta Courts, the decision would be that such legislation is ultra vires. Such a decision, whether it is upheld or not in the Privy Council, might have a most unfortunate effect in Malta, pending the appeal.
4. As examples of the difficulty in which we find ourselves may be stated the provision of Section 2 of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent, which provides that there &quot; shall be a session of the Legislature once at least in every year.&quot; Although we are not aware of any method by which the question could be brought before the Court, we have little doubt that, if proceedings were taken, the Court would express the opinion that the failure of the Governor to take the necessary steps for the holding of an election and a meeting of the Legislature before the expiration of twelve months from the last session was unconstitutional, notwithstanding the fact that, owing to the state of emergency, the legislative powers had been assumed by the Governor; since the powers of the Legislature are not confined to legislation, but include wide powers of debate similar to those enjoyed by the House of Commons in the United Kingdom.5. Another example is that recently encountered in reference to Section 20, which provides : There shall be an annual registration of voters in every electoral division constituted for the election of General Members of the Senate and for the election of Members of the Legislative Assembly, commencing not later than the last day of December in the year next after the commencement of the last preceding registration, and so on during each successive annual period. The first annual registration shall be commenced not later than the 31st day of December, 1922.We have no doubt that the Malta Courts would hold that this meant that an annual registration of voters must be held every year; otherwise, it would appear possible for a Party with a narrow majority to declare that there should be no registration of voters until after the next election.6. If we might venture to express an opinion on the position from a constitutional point of view, we might refer to the fact that there is now no representation on the Nominated Council, which takes the place of the Legislature, other than official representation; and that as time passes it will be increasingly difficult to maintain the allegation that a state of emergency exists.(Signed) ALISON RUSSELL,Legal Adviser.(Signed) PH. PULLICINO,Treasury Counsel.February 2, 1934.Enclosure II. Memorandum.1.   I SUBMIT the following observations for consideration : 2. Article 3 of Ordinance XII of 1905, amending Ordinance VII of 1904, provides that there shall be a revision of lists of electors in February of every year.Article 1 of Ordinance V of 1910 substitutes January for February.Section 19 (1) of the Letters Patent, 1921, provides that the registration of voters and the preparation of electoral lists shall be carried out in accordance with Ordinance VII of 1904, as amended by Ordinances XII of 1905 and V of 1910.But Section 20 expressly deals with the annual registration of voters. It states that there shall be an annual registration of voters commencing not later than the last day of December in each year.Section 19 is expressly made subject to amendment by laws passed by the Legislature.Section 20 is not so made subject to amendment. It is taken out of the provisions of Ordinances VII of 1904, XII of 1905 and V of 1910, in order that it may not be altered by laws passed by the Legislature.The reason for this is that a Government with a narrow majority should not be able to postpone having a fresh register.
The fact that the Act XIV of 1924, while repealing Ordinances VII of 1904, XII of 1905, and V of 1910, makes by article 15, provisions which supplement the provision of Section 20 of the Letters Patent, does not show that Section 19 includes Section 20. Indeed, if Section 20 be not different in quality from Section 19, there would seem to have been no necessity for enacting the express provisions of Section 20, which are, in effect, already contained in the Ordinances mentioned in Section 19.3. As regards legislation by the Governor in reference to provisions of the Letters Patent. The Constitution is not a rigid Constitution; it can be altered by legislation. It is true that this legislation requires a two-thirds majority but it is, nevertheless, the subject-matter of amendment by ordinary course of legislation. When, therefore, a state of emergency is declared, and the carrying on of responsible Government under the Letters Patent is &quot; prejudiced &quot; (which must, it is thought, mean is declared too dangerous to be allowed), the Governor is armed with all the necessary powers to prevent the responsible Government functioning. That would seem to be the whole object of that provision. It cannot be held that the Legislature could not function as all matters are now reserved matters, since there are many things that appertain to a Legislature in addition to legislation such as debate.4. The amendment of the Letters Patent as to the emergency powers has the authority of an Act of Parliament; and it does not seem to me unreasonable that the Governor, the man on the spot, should, in a state of grave emergency, by that express provision, possess powers which are not possessed by the King.It seems to me to be clear that the intention of the emergency power was to provide for a brief semi-martial law interlude, and that it was intended that the Governor should have all necessary powers to prevent any kind of action being taken by or in connexion with responsible Government.5. If it is decided that the Governor has not power to suspend the provisions of the Letters Patent, then, for the reasons submitted in paragraph 2, it seems to me that the registration of voters must go on, and that an amendment of the Electoral Act, 1924, only would not be sufficient.6. As regards the form which the Ordinance should take. It has been suggested that such an Ordinance should take the form of amending Section 15 of the Electoral Act, 1924; but it is submitted that the form of the draft Ordinance forwarded from Malta (which does not expressly refer to any law, but provides &quot;notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary ....&quot;) is to be preferred as being less likely to direct attention to the point at issue.7. The matter is one of great difficulty, since powers which are strictly temporary powers exercisable in a time of grave emergency are being stretched, it is submitted, beyond the limit of their contemplated exercise; and the views put forward above are submitted with deference.(Signed) A. RUSSELL,Legal Adviser.February 15, 1934.Enclosure III. Memorandum by Treasury Counsel.I AM in entire agreement with the Legal Adviser in what is stated in paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 of his minute, but I find it difficult to agree with paragraphs 3 and 4.2. In this connexion, I refer to my memo, (enclosure 3) attached to the secret despatch of the 3rd January, 1934, in which I expressed the opinion that the power of legislation by the Governor under the &quot; emergency clause &quot; cannot be extended so as to have the effect of suspending, amending or repealing the provisions of the Constitution.3. The declaration of a &quot;state of emergency&quot; by the Secretary of State does not in itself suspend the Constitution, but merely transfers, for the time being, the normal powers of legislation from the Legislature to the Governor, namely, the power to make laws &quot; for the peace, order and good Government of
Enclosure IV. M emorandum.SECTION 5 (2) of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent provides that the Special Members of the Senate shall be : (e) Two Members representative of, and elected by, the Trade Union Council.2. Section 7 (4) of the Malta Constitution Letters Patent provides that there shall be constituted a Trade Union Council in accordance with the provisions of the Letters Patent, that is to say : (a) the members of the Council shall be elected, in accordance with the lawfor the time being in force in Malta, by such trade unions as. are registered at the time of the election in accordance with the law so in force;(b) no person shall be qualified to be elected a member of the Council (i) unless he is a member of a trade union which at the time of theelection is registered as aforesaid; or (ii) if he is a member of the Clergy or of the Nobility or of the Graduates or of the Chamber of Commerce;(c) a member of the Council shall cease to be a member if and when a tradeunion by which he was elected ceases to be registered as aforesaid, or if and when he ceases to be qualified to be elected a member.By the Trade Union Act, 1929 (Act XXI of 1929) (as amended by Act III of 1933), the Registrar is to send to the Minister for Justice (and now to the Governor) in the month of June of each year a list of all the registered Trade Unions for publication in the Government Gazette.3. The Trade Union Act, 1929, was amended by Act III of 1933, and one of the provisions of the amending Act is, section 3, that &quot; nothing shall debar the registration of any Trade Union which shall have been recognised by the Minister for Justice in terms of Act XXII of 1929.&quot; This amendment gave power to the Minister to recognise any Trade Union at his discretion. This power was exercised to recognise associations which presumably did not have the qualifications required by the Act, with a view to securing a political majority in the Trade Union Council.4. By Government Notice No. 191 of 1933, Gazette, page 405, the then Minister for Justice recognised five &apos;&apos; other Associations &apos;&apos; as Trade Unions. No certificates of registration were ever issued by the Registrar to the Unions so recognised.Malta &quot; (Section 41 (1)) as distinct from the power to alter the provisions of the Letters Patent or of Orders in Council referred to in Section 41 (6).4. If I am right in saying that the declaration of a &quot; state of emergency &quot; does not suspend the Constitution, then the effects of that declaration cannot be stretched so as to give the Governor the power to do so. Moreover, the powers of legislation by the Governor under the emergency clause are of a temporary character to be exercised by him so long as the emergency exists and cannot therefore reasonably be held to enable him to alter or suspend the provisions of the Constitution.5. The draft Ordinance already submitted does not explicitly refer to any law, but it in fact nullifies for the time being the provision of Section 20 of the Letters Patent and is therefore, in my opinion, ultra vires; but if it is decided that the Governor has the power to suspend the annual registration of voters, then I agree that a draft in general terms is less likely to arouse controversy, as explained in paragraph 6 of the Legal Adviser&apos;s minute.6. Finally, I endorse the remark contained in paragraph 7 of the said minute.(Signed) PH. PULLICINO,Treasury Counsel.February 15, 1934.
5. The list of the Trade Unions registered by the Registrar for the year 1933-34 under section 7 of the Trade Union Act, 1929, was never published in the Government Gazette as prescribed by section 2 of Act III of 1933.6. There was recognition of a Trade Union Council made by Government Notice No. 383 of the 7th November, 1932, &quot;for the current year.&quot; It is not clear what the expression &apos;&apos; for the current year &apos;&apos; conveys or when the term of office of the Trade Union Council so recognised expired. But, however this may be, it is certain that after the 6th November, 1933, the Trade Union Council ceased to hold office; whilst on that date and up to the present there is no registered list of Trade Unions published in the Gazette. Consequently, there is no Trade Union Council in existence. The time is now approaching when the Registrar is, not later than the 31st May, to take steps for the revision of the register of Trade Unions, under section 9 of Act XXI of 1929, as amended by section 1 (i) of Act III of 1929.7. The existence of a Trade Union Council is essential for the purposes of appointing two members to the Senate as referred to in paragraph 1, and the formation of a Trade Union Council under present circumstances would be inter-preted a preliminary for a general election. It may, therefore, not be advisable to go through the procedure for the creation of a new Trade Union Council; on the other hand, a Trade Union Council is required by the Malta Constitution Letters Patent. The same difficulties which are met with in connexion with the suspension of the Electoral Law apply to the suspension of the Trade Union Council Act, 1929 (Law XXII of 1929). If the provisions of the Act be carried out, as they should be if the law remains in force, it is also to be considered whether the recognition of the &quot;other Associations &quot; made by the Minister for Justice for purely political purposes, as described in paragraphs 3 and 4, should be considered effective.8. It should also be noted that section 17 of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, 1929 (Act VI of 1929), provides that two representatives of the Trade Union Council are to sit on the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Board. But as no Trade Union Council is in existence these representatives are not sitting and the work of the Board is conducted by three of the members, the other two seats remaining vacant. This fact also raises a doubt whether the functions of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Board are now being carried out in accordance with the law.(Signed) ALISON RUSSELL,Legal A dviser.(Signed) PH. PULLICINO,Treasury Counsel.February 16, 1934.II.Secret Despatch from the Governor of Malta to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, February 20, 1934.Secret (12). The Palace, Valletta,Sir, February 20, 1934.I HAVE the honour to address you on the subject, which Mr. Dawe has discussed with me by your direction, of setting up an Advisory Council in Malta, consisting partly of Government officers and partly of representative members of the public nominated by me, in order that the Government may associate itself to some extent with representatives of responsible public opinion. Mr. Dawe has shown me copies of correspondence exchanged between yourself and Sir Reginald Stubbs, on the subject of an analogous Council which has recently been set up in Cyprus, and I share your view that a Council on those lines, more or less informal and as little official as possible, would best meet the situation in Malta. There is, however, one respect in which I feel that a slight divergence from the character of the Cyprus Council would be advantageous in Malta, and that is to avoid including among the unofficial members, if this should be possible, persons who have taken a prominent part in party politics.2.   My reasons for this suggestion are these: First, one of the incidental contributory causes of the breakdown of responsible Government here has been the peculiarly bitter and personal character
which politics assume in this small Island, where everybody knows everything there is to be known about everybody else a character which has the result not only that each Party seeks, when in office, to undo the work of its predecessors and to dismiss their supporters, but also that party divisions cut deep into social life. For this reason I am doubtful whether prominent politicians of the opposing Parties would be willing to accept nomination for the same Council.Secondly, it is, I think, generally admitted that Malta needs a period of complete rest and immunity from the conflict of party politics which has troubled its tranquillity so much in recent years, an immunity which cannot be procured unless the professional politicians of the two principal Parties are excluded from any participation in the work of the Government.3. On learning from you that you concur with the above views, I propose to sound privately the gentlemen on the subjoined list as to whether they would be willing to accept nomination : Mr. Edgar Arrigo, M.B.E. Mr. Leone Benjacar. Dr. L. Camilleri, LL.D. Mr. Walter Camilleri. Father A. Cuschieri, O.C. Baron De Piro D&apos;Amico. Mr. Alfonso Maria Galea. Mr. J. Hamilton.I enclose brief particulars regarding each of them.4. As regards the Membership of the Council, I propose that it should consist, under my presidency, of the following five official Members : Lieutenant-Governor, Legal Adviser, Treasury Counsel, Treasurer,Secretary, Maltese Imperial Government,and of eight unofficial members, pixwided that I can find as many suitable persons of the type I have indicated above, who are willing to accept nomination.I would propose that the unofficial members of the Council should be entitled to draw an honorarium at the rate of two guineas for every Sitting they attend, together with a refund of out-of-pocket expenses in respect of any special inquiries which I may call upon them to undertake.5. At the same time I feel that I ought to point out that, in the present state of feeling on the part of the Nationalist Party, I have grave doubts whether it will be possible for me to obtain the services of these, or any other suitable gentlemen, to serve as unofficial Members on such a Council. You are aware of the virulence of the local press; and I fear that persons of moderate views will be deterred by the knowledge that they will certainly be attacked in the Nationalist press some of whose organs are preaching an attitude of non-co-operation from identifying themselves in this manner with Government. Farthermore, the recent murder of Mr. Antonios Triantaphyllides, a member of the analogous Council of Cyprus, an event to which publicity has been given in the Maltese Nationalist press, is likely to be an additional factor tending to deter acceptance to serve on the Advisory Council in Malta.Should my anticipations prove correct, it might be necessary to revert to a purely official Executive Council composed of the officials indicated in paragraph 4 above.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) D.
