Paper No. 1118-B)2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W, 1 January 25, 19349497
ECONOMIC PRESSURE ON GERMANY.Possible Action by the League.Report.I. Preliminary Considerations.IN our previous Report (Paper No. A.T.B. (E.P.) 6) we confined ourselves to considering whether effective economic pressure could be exerted on Germany, by the Powers particularly interested in preventing Germany&apos;s rearmament, with the object of compelling her to observe her disarmament obligations, under the Treaty of Versailles, in a situation where there has been no resort to war, and, consequently, Article 16 of the Covenant is not applicable2. We indicated, however, in that Report, that in the event of the circum-stances of Germany&apos;s rearmament being such as to be generally regarded as constituting a threat to the peace of the world, there might be a possibility of action by a larger number of Powers as a result of the operation of the peace-preserving machinery of the League of Nations.3. The situation contemplated is that the Council or the Assembly, acting under Article 11, Article 13 (4) or Article 15 (4) of the Covenant, recommends to the Members of the League the use of economic pressure as a means of terminating the threat to the peace of the world. The possibility of such action has been suggested in discussions in the past at Geneva, particularly in connection with Article 11. It involves (a) a unanimous recommendation to that effect by the Council,* and (&amp;) the acceptance of the recommendation by all the Members of the League, or at any rate a sufficient number to justify the action in question being taken.4. In the situation described in the preceding paragraph, Article 16 would not be applicable, and the position of the Members of the League who co-operated in the exercise of economic pressure would result, not from their definite rights and obligations under Article 16, but from their acceptance of the recommenda-tion of the Council, made under other articles of the Covenant. But, subject to this consideration, the position as between themselves of the Members of the League who had accepted the Council&apos;s recommendation would, within the limits -of the action recommended, not differ substantially from that which would exist in a case where Article 16 was being applied. By accepting the CounciFs recommendation those countries would, within the limits of the action recom-mended, have abandoned their right to continue commercial relations with Germany, and would have accepted an obligation to take steps to prevent persons subject to their jurisdiction from engaging in such intercourse. It would seem to follow that they would be entitled to expect from one another such assistance a,s might be necessary to enable the common object to be carried out. On the other hand, they would have no right to expect assistance from Members of the League who declined to accept the CounciFs recommendation, or from non-Members who had not agreed to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure; such countries would have a perfect right to continue commercial relations with Germany, and the Members of the League who had accepted the recommendation, since they would not possess the rights of belligerents, would have no right to interfere with commercial intercourse between such countries and Germany.!   In* In certain circumstances the recommendation might emanate from the Assembly, but for the sake of simplicity this possibility is disregai ded in this Report.t It is assumed that the CounciTs recommendation would not contain anything on the lines of the provision in Article 16, Paragraph 1, under which the Members of the league undertake to prevent intercourse &quot; between the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not,&quot; since this could only arise in the event of the Covenant-breaking State having resorted to war.
these circumstances the activities of the States who accepted the CounciPs recommendation would, in effect, be confined to such economic pressure as they could effect by action taken within their own jurisdiction; the extent to which the practical situation would differ from that described in our previous report would depend on the number and importance of the States who agreed to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure.5. The nature and extent of the pressure which could, in these circum-stances, be exercised by the Members of the League who accepted the Council&apos;s recommendation, would depend on the scope of that recommendation, and be limited by the fact that the co-operating countries would not possess any rights against other States. It might be expected to proceed on the following lines. The participating countries would refuse to allow any goods to be exported from their territory to a German destination, and they would refuse to admit to those territories any goods from Germany or of German origin. Generally speaking, they would forbid all persons within their jurisdiction to have any financial or commercial relations with Germany. Ships flying their flags would not be allowed to trade to German ports or to carry German goods, nor would German ships be permitted to trade to their territories. The necessary powers to effect these results would have to be based on the recommendation of the Council, followed so far as this country is concerned, by legislation on the lines of the Trading with the Enemy Acts, and, presumably, by some legislative procedure in most, at any rate, of the other countries concerned. Such action would, in the case of this country, and probably in that of some other countries concerned, involve a violation of the instruments which at present regulate their commercial relations with Germany, but our action would, presumably, be justified on the ground that it was taken on a recommendation of the Council in the exercise of its peace preserving functions made under the Covenant, and, if necessary, on the further ground of retaliation, since its original foundation would be Germany&apos;s violation of her treaty obligations in relation to disarmament. Our treaty obligations to States who had not accepted the recommendation would, however, require consideration, and might, in some respects, limit our freedom of action.6. Our present Report is based, therefore, on the assumption that the Council of the League, by a unanimous vote, recommends the Members of the League to co-operate in exercising economic pressure against Germany in a situation where Article 16 of the Covenant is not applicable. The question of the acceptance of the recommendation by the Members of the League is dealt with in the next Section.7. In estimating the extent to which Germany would be susceptible to the consequences of economic pressure exerted by the League, it is necessary to take some hypothetical basis upon which to work as to the countries which could be expected to co-operate in such pressure. For this purpose it has seemed best to take the extreme case (in spite of its inherent improbability), where all active members of the League, together with the United States of America, would co-operate in the application of economic pressure. By taking this extreme case we are enabled to estimate the efficiency of the proposed economic pressure whenat its maximum : -(A) Of the Powers who are Members of the League of Nations, we have assumed (i) that all Members, with the exception of Japan, would be prepared to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure on Germany, but some of the minor Powers* who are near neighbours of Germany might demand a guarantee of security against* Disarmament by Denmark has reached a point where she has only 8,000 men to hold a frontier of some 35 miles, and could therefore offer but little resistance even to the existing- Reichswehr.II. Countries likely to Co-operate.(ii) that Japan, though technically still a member of the League, would not co-operate.
(B) Of the Powers who are not Members of the League of Nations, we have assumed (i) that the United States of America would be ready to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure;(ii) that Russia would not co-operate, and would seek to improve herfinancial position by increasing her exports to Germany. It is true that recently Russia&apos;s relations with Germany have deteriorated and those with the League and France have improved. Whilst this change of policy has not gone far enough to justify the assumption that Russia would be ready to collaborate with other Powers to coerce Germany into observing obligations imposed upon her by the Treaty of Versailles, it may become necessary if it develops further to reconsider the probable attitude of the Soviet Government.(C) The remaining Powers, with the exception of Brazil, who are not members of the League, do not figure sufficiently in German trade affairs to affect the situation materially one way or the other.III. Pacific Blockade.8. In our previous Report (Paper No. A.T.B. (E.P.) 6, paragraphs 12 and 13) we considered and rejected the idea of a pacific blockade for the following reasons : (i) It has never been exercised against a naval Power of any importance,and, if any attempt to use the naval forces of the participating Powers to enforce such a policy were made, and Germany provided naval escort for shipping destined to or leaving German ports, the naval forces of the participating Powers would either have to let them pass unmolested or attack the escorting man-of-war. In these circum-stances, a state of war might ensue, and the participating Power whose ship resorted to force might be represented as the primary aggressor;(ii) Precedents are in favour of the view that a pacific blockade could notbe enforced against merchant ships of a third party; (iii) It is doubtful whether, under the Covenant and other instruments such as the Pact of Paris, a pacific blockade is permissible, except where it is imposed with the authority of the League of Nations.As regards the above reasons for rejecting the idea of a pacific blockade, (i) stands where it did; (ii) stands in principle, but in practice its importance would depend on the number of the non-participating countries and the size of their mercantile marine; (iii) would disappear in the event of the action recommended including a pacific blockade, but not otherwise.IV. Possible Effects on Germany of Economic Pressure.(Note. Powers we have assumed would be co-operating are printed in heavy type.)9. This section of our report is devoted to a study of German trade, and reviews the possible effects of economic pressure on Germany in the circumstances envisaged. It must always be remembered that,&apos; to the extent to which re-exportation through non-participating countries is practicable, the supplies from whatever original source will become available to Germany. This aspect of the situation is discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 28-30.Imports Food Products.10. Germany is normally self-supporting in meat, potatoes and cereals for both bread and fodder.As regards other food products, Germany is dependent on imports to the extent shown below. The percentage figure shown after the commodity indicates the extent to which Germany has to import that particular commodity, and the percentage figure after the country forming the source of supply indicates the proportion of German requirements provided by each country (average 1930-32).
Fish (45 per cent.). United Kingdom 38 per cent., Norway 21 per cent., Netherlands 16 per cent.The German fishing fleet, if allowed to continue its operations, is sufficiently large to be capable of supplying a considerable part of the fish now imported.Eggs (25 per cent.). Netherlands 33 per cent., Bulgaria 11 per cent., Roumania 10 per cent., Denmark 9 per cent., Belgo-Luxemburg 8 per cent.Russia could, to a considerable extent, meet German requirements.Butter (under 50 per cent.). Denmark 29 per cent., Netherlands 18 per cent., Latvia 12 per cent., Estonia 7 per cent., Russia 8 per cent.Germany has, during the past four years, reduced her imports of butter by approximately one-half. Supplies from Russia could be augmented sufficiently to counteract the sources of supply lost to Germany.Cheese (under 66 per cent.). Netherlands 63 per cent., Denmark 9 per cent.Germany would lose both her principal sources of supply, and might experience some difficulty in meeting her requirements.Rice (100 per cent.). British India 72 per cent., Netherland East Indies 6 per cent.Germany would lose her normal sources of supply, but Korea and Manchuria would afford alternatives.Coffee (100 per cent.). *Central America 44 per cent., Brazil 40 per cent.Germany should experience little difficulty in obtaining sufficient coffee.Cocoa (100 per cent.). British West Africa 80 per cent.Germany would lose this source of supply and would experience difficulty in finding an alternative.Oil Seeds and Nuts (nearly 100 per cent.). British India 15 per cent., Argentina 13 per cent., British West Africa 11 per cent., Manchuria 46 per cent.Germany would lose the first three sources of supply, but could increase her imports of soya beans from Manchuria, and Russia would afford a source of supply for certain descriptions of seeds.Edible Oils and Fats of all so?*ts (nearly 100 per cent.).- Whale Fisheries, Newfoundland, 21 per cent., United States 17 per cent., British America (ex Canada) 14 per cent., Denmark 7 per cent., Norway 6 per cent., British West Africa 6 per cent., Netherlands 6 per cent.Germany would lose her principal sources of supply, and might experience a shortage of these commodities. Russia could provide approximately 25 per cent, of German requirements, and in this connection it has to be remembered that the soya bean grown in Manchuria will be available to Germany.Oil Seed Cake (nearly 100 per cent.). British India 13 per cent., Denmark 10 per cent., France 8 per cent., Philippines 8 per cent., Roumania 6 per cent., Czechoslovakia 6 per cent., Netherlands 5 per cent., Russia 9 per cent.Russia could provide 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, of German requirements.*- Central America has not been shown in heavy type, as Costa Uica, one of the largest coffee producing countries in Central America, is not a member of the League
11. So far as food-stuffs are concerned, it would appear that economic pressure in the circumstances envisaged would have material effect as regards cocoa, cheese, rice, oil seed cakes and, to a lesser degree, edible oils and fats, and the diminution of these supplies might become serious in two or three months if economic pressure by the participating Powers could be made effective.Imports Raw Materials.12. Germany is dependent upon outside sources of supply for the following raw materials to the extent shown below : Cotton (100 per cent.). United States 70 per cent.Russia is a potential source of supply, but Germany might experience a shortage of this commodity when existing stocks ran low. Brazil affords an alternative source of supply.Flax (100 per cent.). Poland 12 per cent., Belgo-Luxemburg 10 per cent., Lithuania, 15 per cent., Russia 46 per cent.Imports from Russia could be increased.Hemp (100 per cent.).- Italy 73 per cent., Yugoslavia 12 per cent., Russia 10 per cent.Russian imports could be increased.Jute (100 per cent.). India 100 per cent.Germany would lose this source of supply, for which there is no alternative.   Substitutes for jute could, however, be employed.Mineral Oils (93 per cent.). United States 40 per cent., Dutch West Indies, &amp;c,19 per cent., Mexico 9 per cent., Russia 16 per cent.Russia could meet all German requirements.Rubier (100 per cent.). Netherland East Indies 44 per cent., British Malaya 23 per cent., British India 14 per cent.Germany might experience shortage of this commodity when existing stocks ran low, but as shown in paragraph 13 below, stocks of rubber may represent as much as one year&apos;s supply.Wool (85 per cent.). Australia 33 per cent., British South Africa 15 per cent., Argentina 13 per cent., France 6 per cent.Germany would lose all her normal sources of supply and would probably experience a shortage of this commodity when existing stocks failed.Hides (45 per cent.). Argentina 29 per cent., France 7 per cent., Uruguay 6 per cent., Other Participating Powers 17 per cent., Brazil 10 per cent.Germany would lose her principal source of supply in Argentina, but imports could be increased from Brazil.Iron Ore (66 per cent.). Sweden 45 per cent., France 22 per cent., Spain 13 per cent.Russia, Korea and Manchuria afford alternative sources of supply, but Germany might experience difficulty in maintaining her stocks, which at present represent about ten months&apos; normal import, or possibly more.
Copper Crude (45 per cent.). United States 28 per cent., Belgo-Luxemburg Economic Union 14 per cent., Chile 11 per cent., Belgian Congo 8 per cent., *British South Africa 5 per cent.Germany might experience difficulty in obtaining supplies, but her stocks are estimated to be in the region of 4 to 6 months&apos; normal supply. Manchuria affords an alternative source of supply.Tin (nearly 100 per cent.). Many different countries.Petroleum Products (82 per cent.). America and Russia 57 per cent., other countries 43 per cent.Germany &apos;s supplies from Russia could be augmented.Stocks.13. As regards the above raw materials, it would appear that stocks of wool (as published) are less than one month&apos;s supply, but any stocks of fleece wool are not included in these figures; stocks of cotton probably do not exceed about two months&apos; supply. Stocks of rubber may represent as much as one year&apos;s supply; stocks of iron ore were reported last April to represent about ten months&apos; normal import, and are probably now somewhat larger. Stocks of pig iron are also reported to be very large, while it is known that Germany has for some time been importing large quantities of steel scrap. Stocks of copper were reported in April to represent not more than two or three months&apos; supply, but have increased recently, and it is thought that the stocks have nearly doubled. No information as regards stocks of tin is available.Other Non-ferrous Metals and Ores.14. In addition, Germany is dependent in normal times to a considerable extent on imports of non-ferrous metals and ores.Bauxite. France 38 per cent., Hungary 30 per cent., Jugoslavia 19 per cent., Italy 13 per cent.Zinc Metal. Poland 50 per cent., Belgo-Luxemburg 10 per cent., Netherlands 8 per cent., Norway 7 per cent., Australia 7 per cent.Manganese Ore. India 18 per cent., Australia 10 per cent., Russia 61 per cent. Pyrites. Spain 57 per cent., Norway 29 per cent.Nickel (Metal)A Canada 16 per cent., Belgium 14 per cent., United Kingdom 28 per cent., United States 28 per cent.Quicksilver. Italy 40 per cent., Spain 25 per cent.Wolfram (Tungsten Ore). The world sources of supply are approximately as follows: China 8,000; India 2,500; United States 1,000; all tons per year; and smaller quantities from Malaya, Australia, Spain and Portugal.15. Certain of these non-ferrous metals and ores are of particular value for the production of munitions. During the first eleven months of 1933 imports of nickel into Germany were double those in 1932, and were at about the same level as in 1929, while imports of nickel ore were much higher than in either year and were of the same value as the imports of metal. The increase in imports is being used, partly at any rate, for nickel coinage.* The proportion from British South Africa in 1932 was 20 per cent.t Until 1933 imports of nickel ore were small in value in relation to imports of the metal, but in 1933 such imports greatly increased, supplies coming from Canada, Greece and India.
16. From paragraph 14 above it will be seen that Germany might experience some difficulty over non-ferrous metals and ores, such as bauxite (France, Hungary), pyrites (Spain and Norway), quicksilver (Italy and Spain), wolfram (China, India, United States), and more particularly nickel (derived from Canadian ore).To a lesser degree Germany might experience a shortage of manganese ore (India, Russia). A shortage of zinc metal is not to be anticipated, since the imports of this from Poland are of metal smelted from German ore.17. In this connection it must be remembered that Germany acquired valuable information in the War with regard to the utilisation of substitutes for many strategic raw materials, and this information will be available for future use, in addition to any post-war work in this direction.18. It would appear, therefore, so far as raw materials are concerned, that the results of economic pressure, if effective, would be felt most quickly in the case of cotton, wool, hemp, and non-ferrous metals and ores such as bauxite, pyrites, quicksilver, wolfram and, more particularly, nickel.19. It has, however, to be remembered that it would be natural for Russia, whose exports to Germany have increased in recent years, to take every oppor-tunity of improving her financial position by exporting to Germany, not only her own goods, but goods of other nations which she would import specifically for the purpose of re-exporting to Germany at a profit (see paragraph 7 (B) (ii)).20. Again, as it has been assumed that Japan would not participate in the application of economic pressure, the resources of Manchuria would become available to Germany, and, whereas the experience of the last War showed that one of the most serious effects of economic pressure was the shortage of oils and fats, Germany would be able to draw on the supplies of soya beans in Manchuria, from which oils can be extracted and which can be used for human and animal consumption and, also, as a fertilizer.21. It has been suggested that if Germany were, in fact, aiming at speedy and complete rearmament, the cutting off of metals and ores required for munition making would produce an immediate effect and would ultimately force her to submit, even if other commodities were still available to her. This argument could only be valid if, in the meantime, Germany had not laid up stocks of the metals and ores in question and in so far as the participating Powers can control these particular supplies. It has been indicated above that in the case of copper and nickel, at least, considerable stocks have already been accumulated, whilst in the case of some other metals and ores adequate supplies could be obtained from or through non-participating countries.Exports.22. The effects upon Germany of a restriction of her exports can be considered under two heads : (1) The effect internally upon Germany of a partial cessation of the manu-facture of goods for export; (2) The effect upon her purchasing power of a reduction of her export markets.23. The first effect would be felt, whether or not the embargo upon imports was made effective. The result of cutting down the German export trade would be a rise in the level of unemployment in Germany proportionate to the diminution-tion of German trade, which might, however, be lessened if any substantial increase took place in the manufacture of war material, or if increased numbers were employed for other, military purposes.24. As regards the second effect that is, the effect on Germany&apos;s purchasing power Germany&apos;s chief markets are Holland, 10 per cent.; the United Kingdom,
10 per cent.; France, 9 per cent.; Switzerland, 6 per cent.; the United States of America, 5 per cent.; Belgium, 5 per cent.; and Russia, 7\ per cent., all of which, except Russia, it has been assumed, would be co-operating in the action proposed.25. If Germany were prevented from importing, her need to export for the purpose of financing her imports would clearly disappear. If, however, for any reason an embargo on imports was not effective, it appears from the fact that her chief markets are in countries co-operating in the scheme, that it would be extremely difficult for her to obtain the necessary finance with which to make purchases of essential foodstuffs and raw materials which do not, in the main, with the possible exception of the United States, come from the countries which take Germany&apos;s exports. A possible alternative solution whereby the partici-pating Powers would agree merely to exclude German goods is discussed in greater detail in Section VII.German Shipping.26. The bulk of German shipping is engaged in services to or from German ports. As it is assumed that all countries participating would be debarred from using German ships and from supplying them with bunkers and essential stores, it follows that economic pressure, if effective, would in the first instance result in the laying up of a considerable quantity of German shipping. Such shipping, however, might find increasing opportunities for carriage to Germany of goods re-exported from non-participating countries (see paragraph 28).Finance.27. The immediate effect of economic pressure would be to transform into a complete default the partial suspension of Germany&apos;s external obligations which is already in operation, and thereby to relieve German banks and industry of a substantial volume of debt. There might also be danger of repudiation in certain directions. German credit abroad would, no doubt, be destroyed, but it is probable that there is still a large volume of German assets in foreign countries, and it would be extremely difficult to prevent the withdrawal of such balances.V. Opportunities for Evasion.28. The period that would necessarily be taken to operate the machinery for the settlement of the dispute, provided by the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaties of Locarno, would probably enable Germany to accumulate extensive reserves of specific commodities before economic pressure could be applied. In addition, we have indicated in the foregoing paragraphs that considerable loopholes in the form of alternative sources of supply would exist whereby Germany could evade the consequences of economic pressure, even when in full operation. There is reason to anticipate that re-export trade would very soon spring up in non-participating countries, e.g., Russia, Japan and Brazil, which it would be impossible to stop without applying a rationing system or similar measure of control to the countries concerned, such as could hardly be contemplated in the circumstances envisaged.29. Apart from the opportunities that Germany would have for trade with countries not participating in the application of economic pressure, it is obvious that much would depend on the extent to which all the participating Powers could be relied upon to carry out their undertakings. This would again depend on whether national sentiment in the countries concerned would be sufficiently hostile towards Germany to enable their Governments to take effective measures to restrain persons who either disapproved of the policy altogether or who were prepared to seize the opportunity to make a profit by evading the restrictions. It is possible that certain Governments might not be efficient enough to prevent illicit trade with Germany; others might be too afraid to resist for any length of time counter-pressure by Germany, while others, again, for internal or political reasons might be driven to connive at trade with Germany, because of the profits which would accrue to their own industries.
30. In view of the above considerations, we think it doubtful whether the members of the League participating in the application of economic pressure could make it effective, in the circumstances envisaged, even if it were applied over a very long period, unless it were reinforced by measures such as could hardly be adopted without the existence of a state of war.VI. Effect on the United Kingdom.31. Whatever the effect of economic pressure on Germany there would be a considerable reaction on the trade of the United Kingdom as well as of the Dominions, India and the Colonies. This section of our report is devoted to a detailed survey of the effect on the trade of the United Kingdom in particular under the following headings : Imports.Exports.Shipping.The Coal Trade.Finance.Imports from Germany.Food Products.32. The principal imports under this head are sugar, wheat, eggs, fruit, potatoes, wines, meat and yeast. With the exception of yeast these are all food-stuffs of which there is an over-supply in the world. Yeast might cause some immediate difficulty, as about 30 per cent, of our imports in 1931 and 25 per cent, in 1932 came from Germany, but increased supplies should be readily forth-coming from other Continental sources and from home production.Raw Materials.33. The principal imports are wood pulp, hides and skins, furs, timber, vegetable oils and agricultural seeds. All these materials are readily obtainable from other sources at home or abroad. Temporary difficulties might arise over the cessation of supplies of a few special materials, but, generally speaking, substitutes are readily available.Manufactured Goods.34. In general our manufactures and those of Germany are competitive, and no difficulties as to supplies should arise, except in specialised products.35. There are a number of cases where German manufactures are the raw material of our industries, and considerable dislocation would be caused while supplies from home and foreign sources were being expanded. Potash, for instance, an important fertilizer, is drawn largely from Germany, and although the French control the Alsace deposits and supplies are beginning to arrive from the Dead Sea, there might be a serious temporary shortage.36. A similar position might arise with such products as acetic anhydride and oxalic acid, which are used in the manufacture of dyes or in dyeing itself, and some classes of synthetic dyes would not be procurable.37. There might also be some difficulties over chemical porcelain, certain, scientific and optical glassware, specialised machine tools and machinery (especially textile), hosiery latch needles and electric carbons.38. There would also be a cessation of supply of many fine chemicals (mainly used as drugs) subject to Key Industry Duty. Many of them could, of course, be made here after an experimental period and at a cost.Exports to Germany.39. The main items in our export trade with Germany are as follows : Fish, coal, raw wool, waste and noils, cotton yarn, cotton piece-goods, woollen and worsted yarns, woollen worsted tissues, and machinery.
40. Germany is by far our most important market for fish, especially cured herrings. The loss of the German trade might be a serious matter for the fishing industry.  Germany is our main market for raw wool, waste and noils.41. Cotton yarns account for nearly one-third of our total exports to Germany of manufactured articles, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the loss of the German market would be of serious consequence to the fine spinning section of the Lancashire industry. This loss might be partially offset by obtaining some of the German trade in the goods for which these yarns are used, but it is evident that considerable dislocation and loss of trade would result.42. The machinery industry would, no doubt, gain far more from a cessation of the imports from Germany than it would lose from the loss of the German market, and, similarly, the woollen and worsted industry should, on balance, gain considerably from a cessation of trade with Germany.43. It has also to be remembered that there is a very considerable re-export trade to Germany; the main items are butter, tea, coffee, furskins, rubber, raw wool and leather.44. Finally, certain of the Dominions and Colonies have a very valuable direct trade with Germany, particularly British India, British East, South and West Africa, the Commonwealth of Australia and Canada.Shipping.45. Economic pressure on Germany Avould affect British shipping in various directions. There is a large volume of trade between this country and Germany, amounting, in 1931, to approximately  96 millions, and in 1932 to  56 millions. Of the cargoes carried, probably about one-third are in British bottoms, and the effect, so far as the trade was not replaced by purchases and sales from and to other countries on the British lines engaged in this trade, would be serious. Ten to fifteen per cent, of British coastal and home trade tonnage is engaged in trading with Germany.46. In addition to the trade between this country and Germany, the trade of the Empire with that country amounted to approximately  57 millions in 1931, and  53 millions in 1932, and of cargoes carried probably 50 per cent, go in British ships. This traffic would also be lost,, except so far as the trade was replaced by purchases and sales from and to other countries.On the other hand, the restricted field for German tonnage would mean certain benefits to British shipping.47. At the present time many of the big German passenger liners call at ports in the United Kingdom, both inwards and outwards, and convey consider-able numbers of British passengers, whereas the big British passenger liners do not call at German ports. The effect of stopping the German liners would be to bring increased passenger traffic to the British ships.48. Under existing conditions many British overseas cargo liners call at German ports both outwards and inwards, whereas German cargo liners do not as a rule call at United Kingdom ports. The action proposed would thus affect the earnings of the former ships to a certain extent, especially in respect to deliveries to German ports. It is doubtful whether they really get much outward German cargo. The main reasons for the Continental calls are to maintain established services.49. The extent to which British overseas cargo liners will benefit by the restricted operations of German shipping will depend largely on the proportion of German export trade in manufactures which will be secured by this country, as British ships would then carry, not only the additional exports, but the resulting additional raw materials required in the United Kingdom.50. In addition to the above it is reasonable to assume that a proportion of Germany&apos;s exports of such goods as coal, machinery, chemicals, sugar, &amp;o, would
be secured by the United Kingdom, thus providing additional employment for British coastal trade ships and tramps.The Coal Trade.51. The embargo on United Kingdom exports of coal and coke to Germany would result in an immediate loss to the United Kingdom of about 225,000 tons a month, or over 2,750,000 tons a year.52. As regards other markets we might expect to gain part only of the supplies to France and Belgium since some of the demand would be met by additional home production. In Italy we might hope to replace the German coal almost entirely by British coal.On these assumptions the gains on these countries can be estimated at Tons.France     ... ... ... ...      2,750,000Belgium   ... ... ... ...      1,500,000Italy        ... ... ... ...      1,250,0005,500,000Less loss in Germany     ... ...      2,750,000Net gain ... ... ...      2,750,000If any country though in sympathy with the action taken were not prepared to exclude German coal from its markets, Germany would certainly attack us in those markets by a price-cutting campaign and there would be an immediate loss to be offset against the net gain shown above.53. It is not inconceivable that when the economic pressure was withdrawn Germany might refuse to resume the Coal Agreement at present in force, and might even go so far as to take steps to prohibit imports for bunkers for use in the free harbours. In this event we would stand to lose at least 180,000 tons a month, or, in the extreme case, 225,000 tons a month.54. It has to be remembered also, that even if trade with Germany in coal were resumed, while Germany would almost certainly be able to recapture some of the trade she had lost in other countries, we should, with equal certainty, find the utmost difficulty in selling coal in Germany, and our loss would be permanent.Finance.55. Germany owes the City of London on short-term, in respect of acceptance and other credits, a sum of between  40 and  50 million.These are covered by the Standstill Agreement, and so long as this is in being, interest is regulariy paid and the bills constitute good assets in the hands of the holders. The imposition of economic pressure would probably bring the Standstill Agreement to an end, and remittances would cease to be made. The financial houses concerned would remain liable for the bills, and, in view of the doubtful prospect of ultimately recovering funds from Germany, would be imminently threatened with insolvency.56. Such a state of affairs would, undoubtedly, entail a financial crisis of the first magnitude unless special steps were taken to assist the financial houses concerned.57.. There is also a considerable amount of short-term debts not covered by the Standstill Agreement, which would become irrecoverable (amount  15 to  20 million).In addition, the United Kingdom is a very large holder of long-term German bonds (amount uncertain, possibly  60 million, nominal). The interest on these latter was paid from July to December 1933, as to 50 per cent, in cash, the remainder being paid in scrip which stands at the discount of 50 per cent.  From
January 1934, the Germans have given notice of their intention to reduce the amount to be paid in cash to 30 per cent.58. The money markets of Holland and Switzerland are also heavily involved in Germany, and should those countries join in the suggested measures of economic pressure, it might lead to a financial crisis and possibly a currency crisis in those countries also, which would inevitably add to the general confusion and have adverse reactions on London.59. Finally, the United Kingdom is interested to a substantial degree in manufacture and distribution within Germany. For example, the British oil companies handle about 30 per cent, of the oil trade in Germany, and the financial loss to the United Kingdom caused by economic pressure would, therefore, be serious.VII. Limitation of Pressure to Prohibition of Entry of German Goods.60. It has been suggested during the course of the investigation of this problem that, since Germany&apos;s chief markets, with the exception of Soviet Russia, are in countries which it is assumed would be co-operating in the attempt to bring pressure to bear upon her, very considerable damage could be done to the German economy merely by a decision on the part of the countries mentioned to exclude German goods the course followed by the United Kingdom in the case of Russia.61. From the point of view of practicability it may be pointed out that, while it is difficult to prevent the export of goods from any particular country to a named destination, on account of the fact that export through a third country is a relatively simple expedient, it is easier to exclude from any country goods of any particular origin. To do so might involve the operation of a system of certificates of origin, but no difficulty which could not be surmounted need be encountered.62. It might be objected that if Germany were excluded from her chief markets, the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Switzerland, United States and Belgium, and if she were free to export to other countries such as Soviet Russia, J apan and Brazil, she might be able to minimise the damage to herself by taking advantage of those markets to dispose of the goods excluded by other countries. A little consideration will, however, show that the extent to which she could find alternative markets would be small. A large part of Germany&apos;s exports consists of highly-manufactured, and often of highly-specialised, goods, adapted with special regard for the requirements of the market in which they are intended to be sold. The market for such products in countries other than those mentioned above would certainly not compensate Germany to any appreciable extent for the loss of the markets to which now she sends the bulk of her exports.63. It is, of course, true that this form of pressure would be less effective than a total stoppage of Germany&apos;s imports and exports, were such a total stoppage practicable. It would be open to her to reduce her imports to bare necessities of food and raw materials and in this way she might well be able to carry on, in spite of the reduction in her export trade and the consequent reduction in the financial resources from which to pay for her imports. But that such measures would bring considerable pressure to bear upon the Government and upon the people of Germany, there can be little doubt.64. It must, however, be remembered that the serious financial consequences indicated in this note as certain to follow a policy of economic pressure on Germany would not in any way be mitigated by the adoption of this less comprehensive policy. The exclusion of German goods from co-operating countries would, in practice, make it impossible for Germany to honour her financial obligations and would certainly be considered by Germany as absolving her from the necessity of honouring any of her obligations towards the countries taking action against her.
YIII. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.1. We have based our investigation on a situation, arising out of a violation by Germany of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, where the Council of the League, acting under Article 11, Article 13 (4) or Article 15 (4) of the Covenant, recommends to the Members of the League the use of economic pressure against Germany as a means of terminating a threat to the peace of the world, and this recommendation is accepted by all Members of the League (paragraph 3).2. In these circumstances, the pressure which could be exercised by the Members of the League would be confined to (a) refusal to allow importation of goods from Germany or of German origin into their respective countries and exportation of their goods to Germany;(&amp;) refusal to persons within their jurisdiction to have financial or commercial relations with Germany;(c) refusal to ships flying their flag to trade to German ports or carryGerman goods;(d) closing their ports to German ships.The necessary powers to effect these results would have to be based on the recommendation of the Council followed, so far as this country is concerned, by legislation on the lines of the Trading with the Enemy Acts, and presumably by some legislative procedure in most, at any rate, of the other countries concerned (paragraph 5).3. Eor the purposes of this Report, we have deemed it best to take the extreme case where all active Members of the League, together with the United States of America, would co-operate in the application of economic pressure.(A) Of the Powers who are Members of the League of Nations, we have assumed (i) that all Members, with the exception of Japan, would be prepared to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure on Germany, but some of the minor Powers who are near neighbours of Germany might demand a guarantee of security against German aggression or retaliation (paragraph 7 (A) (i));(ii) that Japan, though technically still a Member of the League, would not co-operate (paragraph 7 (A) (ii)).(B) Of the Powers who are not Members of the League of Nations, we have assumed (i) that the United States of America would be ready to co-operate in the exercise of economic pressure (paragraph 7 (B) (i));(ii) that Russia would not co-operate, and would seek to improve her financial position by increasing her exports to Germany. It is true that recently Russia&apos;s relations with Germany have deteriorated and those with the League and France have improved. Whilst this change of policy has not gone far enough to justify the assumption that
Russia would be ready to collaborate with other Powers to coerce Germany into observing obligations imposed upon her by the Treaty of Versailles, it may become necessary, if it develops further, to reconsider the probable attitude of the Soviet Government (paragraph 7 (B) (ii)).(C) The remaining Powers, with the exception of Brazil, who are not Members of the League, do not figure sufficiently in German trade affairs to affect the situation materially one way or the other (paragraph 7 (C)).4. So far as food-stuffs are concerned, it would appear that economic pressure in the circumstances envisaged would have material effect as regards cocoa, cheese, rice, oil seed cakes and, to a lesser degree, edible oils and fats, and the diminution of these supplies might become serious in two or three months if economic pressure by the participating Powers could be made effective (paragraph 11).5. As regards raw materials, the results of economic pressure, if effective, would be felt most quickly in the case of cotton, wool, hemp and non-ferrous metals and ores such as bauxite, pyrites, quicksilver, wolfram and, more particularly, nickel   (paragraph 18).6. Germany could take advantage of the interval while the League machinery for the settlement of the dispute was functioning to accumulate reserves (paragraph 28).7. We anticipate that re-export trade would very soon spring up in non-participating countries, e.g., Russia, Japan, Brazil, which it would be impossible to stop without applying a rationing system or similar measure of control to the countries concerned, such as could hardly be contemplated in the circumstances envisaged (paragraph 28).8. Apart from the opportunities that Germany would have for trade with countries not participating in the application of economic pressure, much would depend on the extent to which all participating Powers could be relied upon to carry out their undertakings. This would again depend on whether national sentiment in the countries concerned would be sufficiently hostile towards Germany to enable their Government to take effective measures to restrain persons who either disapprove of the policy altogether, or who are prepared to seize the opportunity to make a profit by evading the restrictions. Certain Governments might not be efficient enough to prevent illicit trade with Germany; others might .be too afraid to resist for any length of time counter-pressure by Germany, while others, again, for internal or political reasons, might be driven to connive at trade with Germany, because of the profits which would accrue to their own industries (paragraph 29).9. In view of the above considerations, we think it doubtful whether the Members of the League participating in the application of economic pressure oould make it effective, in the circumstances envisaged, even if it were applied over a very long period, unless it were reinforced by measures such as could liardly be adopted without the existence of a state of war (paragraph 30).
10. Full economic pressure on Germany would produce injurious effects on the trade of the United Kingdom, as well as of the Dominions, India and the Colonies. These effects would be immediate, severe and, in some respects, possibly lasting. In particular, the exercise of economic pressure on Germany would involve grave financial consequences in this country (paragraphs 31 to 59).11. Modified economic pressure could be brought to bear on Germany merely by the exclusion of German goods by the participating Powers. While this form of pressure would be less effective than a complete stoppage of Germany&apos;s imports and exports, were such a stoppage practicable, it would be much easier to put it into operation and it would bring considerable pressure upon the Government and people of Germany. The serious financial consequences indicated as certain to follow a policy of economic pressure on Germany would, however, in no way be mitigated by the adoption of this less comprehensive policy (paragraphs 60-64).(Signed)WALTER E.
