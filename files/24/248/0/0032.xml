Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   April 1934._________------____222SECRET. Copy No.37CP. 96 (34).CABINET.BELGIUM AND THE TREATIES OF 1839.DURING the Cabinet meeting of the 21st March I was asked whether we were still bound to Belgium under the Treaties of 1839. My reply was that we were not so bound, our present obligations towards Belgium deriving from the Covenant of the League and the Treaty of Locarno. This view is the correct one, but as the position in regard to the 1839 Treaties is somewhat anomalous, my colleagues may be interested in the annexed brief note on the point, prepared by the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office.JOHN SIMON.March 26, 1934.Annex.THERE has been a good deal of discussion since the war as to the present position of the 1839 Treaties respecting Belgium. The situation may be summarised as follows : Article 31 of the Treaty of Versailles did not itself effect the abrogation of the 1839 Treaties, because Holland&apos;s consent was necessary for such abrogation, and she and Belgium have (for reasons unconnected with Belgian neutrality) never been able to agree as to the terms of the treaty by which such abrogation should be effected. On the other hand, article 31 (together with the corresponding provisions in the treaties with Austria and Hungary) may be said to record the assent of Belgium and the guarantor Powers (Russia being left out of account) to the abrogation of Belgian neutrality, and it is, in fact, agreed between the Powers concerned that Belgian neutrality and its guarantee have come to an end. Moreover, apart from Belgium&apos;s signature of the Treaty of Versailles, she has rendered it impossible for her to claim that she is still a guaranteed neutral State by (1) becoming a member of the League without making (as Switzerland did) any reservation to safeguard her neutral position; (2) her military agreement with France of 1920; (3) her signature of Locarno, by which she reserved the right to go to war with Germany in certain circumstances.As regards an attack by Germany, our Locarno guarantee may be said to replace that given in 1839, but this does not apply to an attack upon Belgium by some other Power, though in such a case article 16 of the Covenant would probably be applicable.Foreign Office. _ _Article 31.Germany, recognising that the Treaties of the 19th April, 1839, which established the status of Belgium, before the war, no longer conform to the require-ments of the situation, consents to the abrogation of the said treaties and undertakes immediately to recognise and to observe whatever conventions may be entered into by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, or by any of them, in concert with the Governments of Belgium and of the Netherlands, to replace the said Treaties of 1839. If her formal adhesion should be required to such conven-tions or to any of their stipulations, Germany undertakes immediately to give it.7345   [9858]
