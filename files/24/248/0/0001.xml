CONFIDENTIAL.A.C. 289.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY OOUKOIL.STATE OF TRADE- JANUARY.  19 54.Summary of Report3 submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some oases with statistical information from other sources).Employment *   The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 22nd January was 2,389,068, an increase of 164,989 as compared with 18th December 1923.     This includes an increase of 44,673 in the number of juveniles which is due largely, to children leaving sohool at the end of the Christmas term:    it Is larger than usual this year owing to the sharp rise in the birth rate in the latter part of 1919.     The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, increased by 118,570 and the number temporarily stopped by 46,419.The changes between 18th December, 1933, and 22nd January. 1934, in the different divisions were as follows:-The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 22nd January was 9,874,000t being 134,000 less than a month before, but 609,000 more than a year before.The deoline in employment during the month ooourred principally in the distributive trades, the textile industries, the dress industries  (except hat and oap manufacture), metal goods manufacture, the food and drink industries, woodworking and ftirniture manufacture, the paper, printing, and leather industries, and hotel and boarding house service.   There wasLondon* 41,169 + 13,155* 8,143 + 22,962 4- 23,576* 37,610* 9,951 +    8,423South Eastern South Western MidlandsNorth Eastern North Western Soot landWales
also some decline in the building industry, steel melting and rolling, tinplate manufacture, electrical and constructional engineering, and the transport services.Only a small number of industries showed an improvement in employment during the month.   Among these were iron and other metalliferous mining, pig iron manufacture, marine engineering and the hat and cap Industry.Overseas Trade.     Imports in January were  64.7 m. and exports  31.6 m. compared with  53.9 m. and    .529.2 m. respectively, in January, 1933.    Of the total increase of  10.8 m. in imports  6*3 m. was in raw materials including  2.9 m. for wool.    Exports of imported merchandise were  4.1 m. compared with  4.2 m. and transhipments under bond  2.1 m. compared with  2.2 m.     The excess of imports over exports of merchandise amounted to  29.0 m. compared with  20u5 m.Rail and Road Traffic     During&quot; the four weeks ended28th January, 1934, the railway traffic receipts were  723,000(7.51$) more than in the corresponding period of 1933.     Thepercentage increases in the various classes of traffic were-Passenger Traffic...........    1.52%Merchandise, Minerals andLivestook      .............. 16.75$Ooal, Ooke and Patent Fuel 4.68$Statistics of passenger traffic for November showed thatthe number of passengers, other than season ticket holders,was  2,688,000 (4.7$) more than in the corresponding periodof 19^2.The number of registrations of new motor vehicles  (other than motor cycles) in December 1933, was 4,081 (20.5$) greater than in corresponding period of 19?2.    The increase comprised 2 ,,522 private oars and 1,559 goods and other vehicles * Registrations   of motor cycles showed a decrease of 948  (39.0$).
Retail Trade.     The total value of retail sales in Great Britain was 4.1$ greater in December, 1933, than in the previous Deoember.     This is the third consecutive increase, and the largest, during the year.     The improvement was distributed over the whole country, being 5.6$ in the West End of London, 5.4$ In Suburban London, 5.0$ in the South of England, 3,1$ in the Korth, and 1.8$ in Scotland.   Sales of food and perishables were 2.1$ greater, while in other departments the increase was 6$.    The largest improvements were in men&apos;a and boys1 wear 10.6$, hardware 7.6$, furniture 7.5$, and women&apos;s war 7,5$. Stocks showed a reduotion in value of 1.9$.Department Store sales in December compared with December 1938 showed an increase of 8*6$ in Great Britain and of 7$ In the United States.   Figures for Germany are not yet available but in November there was a decrease of 20.3$.     In Belgium there was a decrease of 13$ in clothing and 4$ in furniture.Finance and Banking.    (l) London.   An analysis of the bullion trade of 1933 shows a net import of ,5191 m., of which the  enk of England acquired about  100 m.The chief events during January were the United States Gold Bill and President Roosevelt&apos;s Proclamation of the 31st January fixing a new gold content for the dollar *    Despite the fact that most of the measures taken by the United Skates administration were direoted towards depredating the dollar, there was a tendency for it to appreciate during JanuaryB   This is probably to be explained by the inherent strength of the dollar and also by the flow of funds back to America to participate in the expeoted rise of prices.   The dollar-frano rate also failed to fall to the expected figure.   The effect of the new American Mint prices In London was to raise gold to 140/- per ounoe on February 5th.     This was still about 2/-below the American price, and 4/6d. above the French.
In spite of these disturbances the money and gilt-edged markets remained steady and British Government stocks rose during the month.     Discount rates remained at a low level,  the rate for three months&apos; Treasury Bills being about  ft(2) Prance.      The financial and economic position of France has for long been fundamentally unbalanced owing to the excess of imports over exports, the falling yield from foreign investments and the shrinkage in tourist traffic. This disequilibrium would normally have been corrected by a fall in the value of the franc, but owing to the maintenance of the gold standard this automatic correction did not appear. The periodic contraction of credit by the Bank of Prance combined with a general lack of confidence in the public finances has made recourse to new taxes and economies imperative.     Recent events in the United States have combined to place Prance in an extremely difficult position,  and so long as the wide disparity between the franc-dollar exchange and the new gold parity remains, a h-avy loss of gold by the Bank of France appears inevitable.(3) Germany.      The representatives of the foreign medium and long term creditors have been successful in their recent negotiations with the Reichsbank.      Under the new arrangement creditors will receive as previously arranged 70;^ of their interest in Konversionskasse scrip and 30fi in cash, but instead of the scrip being repurchased at only 50$ of its face value, it will now be repurchased at 67$.     As a result the foreign creditors will thus get 76.9$ of their nominal interest instead of only 65;a as under the -previous arrangement,,      The discriminatory treatment for Swiss and Dutch creditors is to be withdrawn after the 30th June next.During 1933 as s whole the German capital market has shown marked improvement and there has been a steady tendency
towards lower interest ratesj    e.g. high class 6yJ bonds which a year ago stood at 78.2 are now 94$.(4) U.S.A.      On 15th January President Roosevelt sent to Congress his Gold Bill which hands the country&apos;s gold stocks over to the Treasury and appropriates to the State any profits from the revaluation of the gold.        It also creates a stabilisation fund of 2,000 million dollars and limits the devaluation of the dollar to a minimum of 40^.     The effect of the Bill is to take the control of credit out of the hands of the Federal Reserve System and to place it in those of the Treasury.      By limiting the ultimate value of the dollar to the range of 50-60 cents, a feeling of greater confidence has been created, and the prosioects of the Governments loan programme have been correspondingly improved.     The flow of capital back to America was given a further impetus by the president&apos;s proclamation of 31st January which fixed the new gold content of the dollar and announced the willingness of the Treasury to buy gold, both domestic and foreign, at 35 dollars per ounce.     The Treasury is also prepared to sell gold at the same price for export whenever the dollar rate reaches the gold export point.      The United States can thus be said to be back on the gold standard although the actual price of gold may be changed again.Economic activity hi January showed distinct signs of improvement, owing, no doubt, to the lavish Government expenditure and the prevailing feeling of greater confidence. Steel production was at a slightly higher level and is expected to rise further.      Electricity consumption and railway car loadings also showed an encouraging improvement compared with the previous year and the textile industry has received large orders.
Industrial.Coal.     The output of saleable coal for the year 1933 was 207.0 m.  tons compared with 208.7 m.  tons in 1932.      The output in each of the first three weeks of 1934 was greater than in the corresponding weeks of J.933.The number of persons employed on the 20th January was 784,200 compared with 783,400 at the corresponding date in 1933 and the weekly output per person was 6.20 tons compared with 5.76 tons.Total exports in January were 3.01 m. tons compared with 3.22 m.  tons in January, 1933, but exports to Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and France all showed an increase. Shipments as bunkers amounted to 1.21 m.  tons as against 1.12 m.  tons in January, 1933.On the North ^ast Coast there is a lull in the demand, but as most collieries are well sold ahead the position is causing no anxiety.     The South &quot;wales market shows no change while in Scotland there has been 3ome slackening in exports.      In the iiidlands the demand has been disappointing owing to the mild weather.Iron and Steel.     The improvement in the iron and steel industry noted during December continued in January.     Four additional furnaces were put into blast making a total of 85. The production of pig iron amounted to 441,000 tons compared with 409,000 tons in December and 287,000 tons in January,  1933. The steel output was 711,000 tons compared with 659,000 tons in December and 444,000 tons in January, 1933.      Business in pig iron was active and in some districts demand exceeded supply. New orders for semi-finished material were small as the larger consumers are already covered by forward contracts.     In finished steel the domestic demand has been well maintained, but export trade continues at a low level.
The improvement noted recently in Scotland has continued and production is now at a higher level than for some years. Demand from the shipbuilding yards has improved and the commencement of the Admiralty building programme is expected to lead to a further increase.      Pew export orders have been received and it is feared that the depreciation of the American dollar will make business in Canada more difficult,      There have, however, been more enquiries from the South American   and South African markets.      Prices of raw materials have shown a tendency to rise and on 9th February there was an increase of 5s. per ton in the price of pig-iron.On the North liiast Coast three extra furnaces were blown in last month making a total of 23.      Demand continues to exceed supply and preparations have been made to re-start more furnaces during February.      One of the most striking features of January was the improvement in the demand from the shipbuilding yards.      Orders from the structural engineering trades have also been somewhat better and a considerable amount of business has been &quot;booked for wagon-makers.In South Wales the tone of the market was weaker. The only section showing any improvement wai the tin plate market in which sales have recently increased,In Sheffield the steel industry continues to show considerable activity, the greater part of the business being for the domestic market,      Conditions in the heavy engineering trades are also improving.      The production of basic billets continues to increase in response to the expansion in demand and it is reported that the supply of cold rolled strip is insufficient to fill orders.        The makers of stainless steels are Increasing their output.Shi oping .      The tonnage under construction in Great 3ritain and Ireland on 31st December, 1933, was 332,000 tons gross, oompared with 225,000 tons gross a year previously,
The index number of shipping freights (1913 ^ 100) was 81.37 in Jan.  1934 compared with 87.95 in the previous month and 80.51 in January, 1933.      The net tonnage laid up in Great Britain and Ireland on 1st Jan. was 1.24 million tons compared with 1.97 million tons on 1st Jan. 1933.Electricity.      The production of electricity during January was 1,536 million units as compared with 1,338 million units in January, 1933.      For the whole of 1933 there was an increase of 10t7/o over the output of the previous year.The percentage of productive capacity for electrical apparatus in use remained practically stationary during the month at about 50^.      The volume of new orders in the home market is still low but there has been a marked expansion in the export market.      Orders received for heavy plant in the home market were lower than in January, 1933, but fw? the export market the orders were considerably higher^      Orders for light apparatus were well maintained during December^      Imports for the whole of 1933 amounted to  2.4 m. compared with  2.7 m.  in 1932.      Exports during the same periods were  6,7 m.  as against  6.8 m.Motor Industry.      Reports from many export markets indicate that ground is now being lost to American motor manufacturers, The 20 H.P. American car appears to be returning to favour in preference to the lower powered United Kingdom product,,      In South Africa the United Kingdom percentage of car sales, whicV. was 38?i in the first quarter of 1933, had fallen by November to 2QP/o.     A similar deorease was noted in the sales of United Kingdom commercial vehicles.In Switzerland British exporters are finding great difficulty in complying with the demand of the Swiss Authorities that they should fit Swiss equipment as standard on their British chassis, The fact that contracts have already been placed for at least a year ahead makes compliance with this demand difficult, apart from the consideration that such action would render British cars less competitive.
It ie .repojrted,^fr-om-G^j?T^^ from taxationaccorded to home-built cars during 1933 resulted in the production of private cars for that year being double the figure for 1932cMachine Tools.      The home demand for machine tools improved during January particularly as regards the lighter types.      In the Midlands there is a definite shortage of skilled labour suitable for the manufacture of maohine tools.     Exports amounted to  83,000 compared with  140,000 in January, 1933.      Imports were  119,000 compared with  58,000 in January, 1933.Paper.     Activity in the paper trade in January suffered a pronounced setback which was greater than that normally experienced in this month.The shortage of mechanical pulp caused by the drought in Scandinavia countinues, and there was a further rise in price during January.An important event was the break-up of the Convention of Continental makers of M. G. Sulphite papers, the price of which at once dropped  2 per ton in the United Kingdom market.  .  As the duty on this class of paper is fixed by the Scandinavian Trade Agreements the British producer will not be able to seek further protection against this fall in price.     At the same time the European Convention which controls the price of the sulphite pulp from which the paper is made continues in force, and is keeping up the price of restriction of output.Chemicals.      Home and export trade in alkalis and heavy chemicals remained&amp;ed satisfactory during January.      Sales of dyestuffs showed an increase both in weight and value over the figures of January, 1933, and trade in the main dye-consuming industries, other than calico printing, continued good. Demand for wood distillation products and for all types of coal tar products, other than pitch, wan at a satisfactory level and the demand for refined coal tar increased.Other Industries.     The demand for motor-tyres in the home market remains satisfactory.     Export business is difficult but
British manufacturers are still obtaining a reasonable share of it.     Competition from Japan has been felt in rubber thread, surgical rubber goods, tennis and golf balls;    and the import of elastic goods from America has increased with the depreciation of the dollar.     Offers of rubber footwear produced in Empire countries under Asiatic conditions are causing instability in the market.     Margarine sales in January were about 14$ less than in January, 1933, owing to the continued low price of butter. Deliveries of edible oils and fats were normal, but forward business was restricted owing to the low price of American pure lard.Empire.Canadian Trade.    Imports during the year 1933 amounted to ,2*401 nu compared with $453 m. in 1932, a decline ef 11%.     iSxports were $538 m. compared with $502 m. a gain of nearly 6$.     The excess of exports over imports was $136 m. compared with $49m. in 1932.     Mineral production during the year showed an increase of 8.5$ as compared with 1932, and wood and paper production an increase of 14.2$.In January, 1934, exports amounted to $46,7 m. and imports $32.5 m. as compared with $31.6 and $24.4 in the previous year, an aggregate gain of 4*3%.The index of the physical volume of business was 86*2 in December compared with 85.5 in the previous month.      The wholesale price index in December was 69*0 compared with 64,0 in December, 1932.Australian Trade.      Imports of merchandise during December, 1933, amounted to  5,6 m. (Australian currency) compared with  5.5m. in the previous December.     Exports of merchandise were  13.0 m. (Australian currency) compared with  10c3 m. in December, 1932. Between the 1st July and the end af December, 1933, 2,258,000 bales of wool were received into store of which 1,478,000 were disposed of by Bale and shipment.     The price of wool continues to rise and is now 14.55 pence per pound or  18,17.8. per bale.      This Is 6/3d. per bale better than in the previous month.     Exports of
-     16&quot;butter this season are, up to the present, lower than in the previous year but the experts of hides and skins have practically doubled and the shipments of eggs have also shown a definite-increase.      Bank clearings in Sidney, Melbourne and Brisbane for the 12 months ending January, 1934, shovr in each case an increase over the previous year.      Customs and Postal receipts for the 7 months ending January, 1934, also increased.South African Trade.      The recent months have witnessed phenomenal rainfalls throughout the farming country and have completely changed the dried up condition resulting from the earlier drought.      The outlook for crops and livestock generally Is favourable.      The damage caused by the last drought has induced the Government to embark upon sohemes of irrigation and water conservation.The improvement in industrial activity reported in recent months continued during December.Railway revenue showed an increase of I6.IJ0 for the five weeks ending 23rd December and motor registrations were also well in advance of those for the corresponding period of the previous year.Indian Trade.      The trade figures for the complete year 1933 now available show that imports of merchandise amounted to 116 crores of rupees oompared with 133 in 1932.      Exports of merchandise were 147 crores compared with 138, and net exports of gold 50 crores compared with 74;    the excess of exports over imports amounted to 82 crores compared with 73.
