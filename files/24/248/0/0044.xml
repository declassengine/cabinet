COPY NO.     4&apos;-&apos;-108(34).CABINET.THE NEXT IMPSRIAL CONFERENCE. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.,In his memorandum of April 10th, CP. 105(34), the Secretary of State for the Dominions suggests that an informal message might be sent to Dominion Prime Ministers, proposing an Imperial Conference next year.     I am sorry to send to my colleagues at such short notice a memorandum on this question, but his proposal raises matters of great interest from the commercial point of view.     I find It somewhat difficult to think of an agenda for suoh a Conference that is not fraught with considerable danger to our interests.I should be very sorry if economic questions, and particularly those arising out of the Ottawa Conference, had to be discussed at an Imperial Conference so soon.     The Ottawa Agreements were arrived at after separate discussions with each Dominion.     In general   they envisaged a long-range commercial policy, and it would be premature to attempt to review Ottawa as a whole in the middle of the period of the Agreements. Moreover, certain interests both here and in the Dominions are dissatisfied with the results of Ottawa, and at any Conference we should not only be subjected to pressure to make concessions to Dominion interests which would antagonise home interests, but also to secure modifications in Dominion policy and practice to meet the desires of our own industries.It is true that as regards meat and dairy products, weacquire a free hand in June, 1934 and August, 1935, respectivelybut such matters are, I suggest, better dealt with ad hoc,in consultation with the particular Dominions ooncernedwith eaoh subject, than in the atmosphere of a Conference.Moreover, in view of the feeling that exists in some-1-
quarters that our anility to assist British agriculture is hindered &quot;by the Ottawa Agreements, it is undesirable that we Bhould defer discussion with the Dominions until the relevant provisions of the Agreements oome tc an end.In the case of India, we hope to commence shortly ad hoc discussions on one cr two commercial matters;   &quot;but India would probably propose to defer discussion on them if a Conference next year were contemplated.     Apart from these points, we have every reason to avoid presenting the anti-British interests in India with an opportunity of pressing the Government of India to give the six months notice to terminate the Ottawa Agreement.On the whole we should probably lose by a general revision of Ottawa next year.     It is most difficult to see in what way we should gain.I fear that it would not be possible to exclude economic questions from the Conference if one were held. iSven if the Governments were unanimous in wishing to do so, pressure from their producing and exporting interests to deal with economic matters would be almost irresistible.As regards shipping (to which the Secretary of State refers), if conference with the Dominions is required in connection with the present shipping crisis, such a meeting could probably nut depend on the date fixed for an Imperial Conference.      In general, a full Imperial Conference is not a convenient medium for discussion of definite shipping problems. They are better dealt with ad hoc, unless they have to be part of a &quot;bargain&quot;.In view of the political inconvenience of a Conference in 1936, I propose that we should aim at 1937, when in any case there must be some discussion with the Dominions as the
Ottawa Agreements will then expire.      So far as I can see, the political matters mentioned in the Secretary of state&apos;s memorandum do not render a Conference in 1935 imperative.W.R.16th April, 1934.
