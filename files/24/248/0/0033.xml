Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 97 (34).CABINET.ANGLO-FRENCH COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.MY colleagues will wish to have some account of the negotiations which have been proceeding with the French Government. The history of the French quotas and allied questions up to the point where we decided to impose a 20 per cent, surtax on a range of French goods was set out in my memorandum (CP. 22 (34)) which was considered on the 24th January. The position when negotiations opened was briefly as follows : In January France had by agree-ments, notably with the U.S.A. and Belgium, given to these countries higher import quota percentages for certain classes of goods than the United Kingdom enjoyed. We considered this to be discrimination against us and had retaliated by the 20 per cent, surtax on silks, &amp;c. The French had replied by denouncing-the Franco-British Conventions of Commerce and Navigation of 1826 and 1882, the denunciations to take effect on the 12th May next. Subsequently it had been agreed in diplomatic correspondence to enter upon negotiations (for which the French had long been asking) on the basis of the existing position. We had suggested that, as a preliminary to negotiations, both sides should remove their discriminatory measures, but the French stated that they were unable to agree to this, since it would prejudice the principles of their policy.2. M. Lamoureux, the French Minister of Commerce, accordingly came to London accompanied by experts and opened the negotiations with me on Wednesday, the 14th March. He began by informing us that his Government had now taken powers to remove the differential &apos;&apos; import turnover &apos;&apos; tax  one of our long-standing grievances on which we had demanded satisfaction as a preliminary to the opening of negotiations and said that the desired reduction of the tax would actually be made early in the following week (this has now been done).3. Outlining his general idea of the negotiations, M. Lamoureux began by arguing that measures taken by us (the depreciation of sterling, import duties and Ottawa) had had the effect of turning France&apos;s favourable balance of trade with us into an unfavourable one, and that his Government desired, as a condition of restoring our full quotas, to see measures taken which would result in equilibrating the balance of trade. I pointed out in reply that any balance unfavourable to France was due solely to re-exports from this country; that on manufactured goods the balance was two to one against us; and finally that if &quot; invisible exports &quot; were taken into account, the net balance would be definitely in France&apos;s favour.   This rather barren argument was not further pursued.4. M. Lamoureux went on to say that the concessions his Government would want were mainly agricultural, but that there were also certain industrial ones. The principal agricultural concession which they wanted was some relaxation of our Colorado beetle restrictions, which exclude not only all French potatoes at all times, but also other fresh vegetables from most of France during the [9884] b
spring and summer. He also indicated that his Government would desire some concessions in respect of our agricultural duties.5. As regards his industrial desiderata, M. Lamoureux first put forward two alternative proposals, viz., either that we should adopt quotas and guarantee a certain percentage to French goods, or else that we should agree to purchase definite quantities of certain French goods. He did not, however, continue to press these suggestions, either of which would clearly have presented insuperable difficulties for us. He added that France also desired certain duty concessions in respect of industrial products, though in the present monetary conditions she did not expect much benefit from these.6. He proceeded that, while his Government were ready on terms to restore our 100 per cent, quotas, there were two cases of special difficulty, viz., cotton goods and coal. As regards cotton goods, the French textile interests were afraid of our prices undermining their market, and he desired to see some understanding reached between the British and French cotton industries which would prevent this. In the case of coal, his Government had taken power to make a 10 per cent, cut in the existing quota. This had been suspended pending the negotiations, but he stated that, as a condition of waiving it finally, an agreement should be reached between our coal interests and the French pit-prop interests for the purchase of a quantity of French pit props. I replied that, while we should be prepared to do what we could to facilitate such discussions between the industries, we could not agree that the granting of our 100 per cent, quotas for coal and cotton should be made contingent on their successful issue. Since the full quotas for these goods had been restored to certain other countries, a failure to concede them to us would, in our view, involve discrimination.7. M. Lamoureux commented that his Government could not admit the existence of discrimination, since they are applying to all countries a uniform system, viz., that of bargaining with their quotas for counter-concessions. They were not, however, enamoured of the quota system, and hoped, as more normal monetary and economic conditions return to the world, to get rid of it. He went on to suggest that in some cases, e.g., as regards the United States bacon quota, we had adopted similar methods. This suggestion I refuted, and made it clear that we should be bound to treat as discrimination any instance in which United Kingdom goods received unfavourable treatment as compared with those of other countries. As I had anticipated, it became clear that no compromise could be reached between the views of the two sides on this underlying question of principle, and from then on the negotiations resolved themselves into an attempt to reach a purely practical accommodation. I had paved the way for this by pointing out that in order to safeguard our position of principle, just as the French desired to safeguard theirs, they could not expect to receive concessions from us (other than the abolition of our 20 per cent, surtax), merely in return for the restoration of our full quotas, and that in return for any concessions we made we should want further ameliorations in the quota system, particularly as regards its administration, which in the case of the new quotas is exceedingly irksome and damaging to our trade.8. In accordance with our expectations the French representatives showed no desire to embark on a tariff negotiation over a wide field. This we ourselves desired to avoid, and, indeed, we should not have been in a position to undertake its negotiation in present circumstances. Further, the French desired any agree-ment to be exclusively as between France and the United Kingdom. This [ concurred in, seeing that it is the settled policy of France to make separate agreements with Dominions and dependencies, and further that any other course would have greatly protracted and complicated the negotiations.9. As the next step I stated the concessions we desired in respect of quotas. These comprised principally : (i) The restoration of all our quotas to 100 per cent, and no further cut in the coal quota.(ii) The abolition of some of the new quotas (i.e., those introduced on the1st January) of primary concern to the United Kingdom, (iii) Important improvements in administration, especially by transfer of the administration of new quotas to organisations in the United Kingdom.
(iv) A change in the basis period where the present basis is unfavourable to us.(v) No imposition or increase of fees for import licences on our goods, (vi) Provisions to ensure that in any general increase or decrease of the quotas our proportionate share should be maintained, (vii) An extension of the quota period and provision for the &quot;carrying over &apos;&apos; of unused portions of quota from one period to another, and certain other minor desiderata.10. These requests could not be regarded as unreasonable, and were for the most part necessary or at least highly desirable in order to get rid of the most serious difficulties to which the new French quota policy gives rise.11. Up to this stage it will be seen that the French had been vague and distinctly exorbitant as to their demands. With a view to abbreviating the discussions and obtaining from them clear indications of what they wanted, I thought it advisable next to have some private conversation with M. Lamoureux. I gave him to understand very definitely that our essential requirements were limited to the restoration of our full quotas together with reform of their administration. In return for this we would remove .our 20 per cent, surtax. Further, if it would facilitate matters for him, we were quite prepared to consider certain concessions in matters of agriculture (including even some in respect of the sanitary regulations). But for this the French must themselves give us something in return, over and above the bare restoration of our 100 per cent, quotas, which would be compensated by the removal of the 20 per cent, surtax.12. In these private conversations considerable progress was made. M. Lamoureux agreed that our quotas (including that on coal) should be restored to 100 per cent.; that there should be no discrimination against us; that details of the administration should be adjusted, and that there should also be certain minor ameliorations. This arrangement was to be embodied in a special agree-ment which should last for one year, and thereafter be automatically renewable subject to three months&apos; notice of withdrawal. As regards other questions, we agreed that the navigation provisions of the old Anglo-French Conventions should be regarded as definitely denounced, the position being sufficiently covered by the League of Nations Maritime Ports Convention of 1923. A new permanent treaty, denounceable at six months&apos; notice, was to be initiated to replace all the articles of the 1882 Convention, except the navigation clauses. As regards counter-concessions, M. Lamoureux still maintained his demand for agreements between the French and British industries in respect of (1) coal and pit props, and (2) cotton goods. On this I indicated that we could not modify our attitude (see paragraph 6). He asked also (apart from the agricultural demands) for the stabilisation, for the duration of the agreement, of our duties on sparkling wines and brandy, and on silk and artificial silk, as well as certain minor concessions on certain other duties.  I promised to look into these requests.13. The heads of proposals resulting from these conversations were next discussed between the experts on the two sides. On our quota requests the French showed themselves distinctly unforthcoming at the outset. While in principle willing to restore our full quotas and to agree to the principle of non-discrimination, they were not prepared to give us any substantial satisfaction in respect of one of our most important requests, viz., that of the transfer to this country of the administration of some of the more important new quotas; they refused to consider any change of the basis year, and most of our other requests, as set out in paragraph 9, they turned down.14. There was also some discussion of the outlines of a new Treaty to replace that of 1882, but it was obvious that the negotiation of such an instrument will take some little time.15. As the next step I informed M. Lamoureux privately which of the concessions he had asked of us were possible and which were not. I repeated that we could not do more than facilitate discussions between the coal and pit-prop interests and the cotton interests. We could not compel the British industries concerned to come to an agreement with the French, and could not allow the restoration of our full quotas to be dependent on the results of such [9884] b 2
conversations between the industries.* We might, however, agree to stabilise the duties on sparkling wines and brandy. This was an important concession, as it would entail a sacrifice by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of possible revenue. We were not prepared, however, to stabilise the silk duties, as these were being recast by the Import Duties Advisory Committee. Some modification of the duties in the near future was therefore inevitable, but it might affect the inferior goods imported from certain other countries more severely than the high-grade Trench goods, and might thus, in fact, act as an indirect preference to the French imports. I later indicated that, in return for these concessions and for the withdrawal of our 20 per cent, surtax, we must insist not merely on the restoration of our full quotas in every instance, but also on the transfer to this country of the administration of some of the more important ones.16. On the morning of the 19th March the French experts produced drafts of the special quota agreement and of the first part of the new commercial treaty. These drafts are annexed (Annexes 1 and 2). On the 19th March there were two further private meetings, the first between M. Lamoureux and myself and the second with the Minister of Agriculture present. At the first meeting some progress was made, but at the second meeting M. Lamoureux announced that he could not conclude an agreement if the silk duties were not stabilised. M. Lamoureux also handed to me at this meeting a revised list (Annex 3) of the quota concessions which he was ready to make (these included a promise to transfer the administration of certain quotas) and a revised list (Annex 4) of his requirements of us. He never actually stated his minimum requirements in the matter of agriculture, but it was understood that they would include (1) Extension by one month of the date limiting the import of freshvegetables, which is at present the 15th March; (2) Reduction by a certain kilometrage of the &quot; sanitary zone,&quot; from whichthe import of fresh vegetables is prohibited; (3) Tariff reductions on certain fresh flowers, fruit and vegetables; (4) Permission for the entry of French potatoes after certain processes ofdisinfection.On points (1), (2) and (3) the Minister of Agriculture was ready to make considerable concessions. The course of the agricultural discussions is described in more detail in Annex 5.17. I had a further private meeting with M. Lamoureux on the 20th March, when he announced that he was prepared to agree on every outstanding point (apart from agriculture, as to which he was waiting to hear further from the Ministry of Agriculture), but he must insist on the stabilisation of the silk duties. He added that, if we were prepared to stabilise the silk duties for the period of the agreement, he would be prepared not to raise any French duties on United Kingdom goods subject to quota before the 15th November next (this date was chosen because the French Government&apos;s powers to raise duties by decree only run to the 15th November). Unless he could obtain such stabilisation, he must suspend the negotiations and return to Paris. I pointed out that if he did so the prospects of an agreement would be greatly jeopardised. Not only did the value of certain of the agricultural concessions which we were prepared to make diminish from day to day as the spring approached, but if agreement had not been reached by Budget day the Chancellor of the Exchequer might impose an additional duty on sparkling wines and brandy. After a long discussion M. Lamoureux finally agreed to telephone to Paris to enquire whether in regard to the silk duties he might not take advantage of a clause which his own experts had proposed for insertion in the quota agreement. This clause provides that, if during the operation of the agreement either of the Governments considers that its equilibrium has been upset owing to measures taken by the other Government, it may denounce the agreement on one month&apos;s notice.   It was suggested to* Note. Towards the end of the negotiations, we were informed by the French Delegation that representatives of the French cotton industry were coming to this country with a view to discussions with Lancashire representatives, and arrangements were made for a meeting, which in fact took place. The object which the French side had in view was to arrive at some price understanding; but the official negotiations had meanwhile been suspended and nothing came of the meeting.
M. Lamoureux that if, when our silk duties were recast, the French considered that they were being unfairly treated, they might take advantage of this clause to denounce the agreement.18. M. Lamoureux returned later to say that he had referred this suggestion to his Cabinet, but that they could not accept it. Unless we would stabilise the silk duties or impose on silk imports from the various countries quotas on an equitable basis, he must suspend the negotiations. I pointed out to him the dangers of this procedure, but was unable to move him. All the other points which he had discussed with me could, he said, be settled immediately, but on the silk duties there could be no compromise. Moreover, he was still waiting to receive final satisfaction on the agricultural questions. He gave me the impression that he himself would have been ready to settle, but that pressure had been brought on him from Paris on behalf of the Lyons silk interests.19. In these circumstances there was no alternative to suspending the negotiations, though it was made clear that the position remained quite open. Before leaving M. Lamoureux said that he would honour his Governments promise to reduce the &quot; import turnover &quot; tax, and there was some discussion of the possibility of an understanding between the two Governments not to impose further disabilities, pending the resumption of discussions, on imports from the other country. I had to point out, however, that such an understanding would interfere with the freedom of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the preparation of the Budget. M. Lamoureux observed on his side that further discussion between the delegations would in any case be necessary within the next few weeks, since the denunciation of the Conventions of 1826 and 1882 takes effect as from the 12th May, and that, before that date, it would be necessary to have at least a modus vivendi to regulate commercial relations between the two countries.20.   To sum up, the main difficulties encountered were : (1) The desire of the French to be free to make a 10 per cent, cut in our coal quota if the discussions between the British coal interests and the French pit-prop interests did not succeed;(2) The question of the transfer of administration of the principal new quotas to this side (though a certain measure of satisfaction on this point appeared to be in sight in the later stages); and(3) Particularly, our inability to give any promise as to our silk and artificial silk duties.But for this last obstacle, it seems probable that some arrangement could have been reached.(Initialled)      W.

As had been expected, the principal French request in the agricultural sphere was for modifications of the Colorado beetle restrictions, both as regards the prohibition on potatoes and also as regards the restrictions on the importation of fresh vegetables during part of the year. The French suggested a reduction of the prohibited zone and a lengthening of the period during which fresh vegetables are allowed to enter this country. They also desired certain tariff concessions in regard to flowers, vegetables, &amp;c.2. As regards the beetle restrictions, they were told that the Minister would examine their case as regards fresh vegetables, and hoped to be able to meet them in some respects, particularly by extending the date of permitted entry to the end of March at least. He would also consider carefully the question of reducing the prohibited zone. On this last question, however, a decision could not be given for a few weeks, and the French delegates were warned that any precipitate decision upon it might cause great trouble in our Parliament. The French then asked whether they could tell their Government confidentially that we were examining the question with the intention of giving them satisfaction within a month, but it was felt to be inadvisable to state an exact period. It could be said that we were examining the question of the &apos;&apos; zone &apos;&apos; with the sincere intention of meeting the French desires as far as possible. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it would be very difficult for us to make a concession on the date of permitted entry for vegetables while the French authorities maintained their embargo on imports of British seed potatoes.   This the French representatives indicated to be a
retaliatory measure for our prohibition of entry of French potatoes. They expressed the view that potatoes could not carry the beetle if subjected to their methods of disinfection and re-packing; but it is not considered that these methods could be relied upon as completely satisfactory when applied under commercial conditions. The French representatives were warned that even if the sanitary regulations against potatoes were modified, there was not much chance of a big trade in potatoes resulting, since sanitary restrictions would have to be replaced by economic restrictions, seeing, particularly, that any alleviation in the sanitary restrictions would have to be extended to the U.S.A. and Canada also. The French representatives said they appreciated these considerations, and did not wish to embarrass British agriculture, but the lifting of the sanitary embargo on their potatoes was vital to France&apos;s negotiations with other countries. The Minister of Agriculture told them, however, that he could give no promise of being able to meet them in this respect.3. The French representatives then tried to find out whether their Govern-ment would be prepared to give at any rate a temporary suspension of the embargo on our seed potatoes if unrestricted entry for their vegetables were permitted up to the end of March at least. Subsequently, however, they indicated that their Government were not willing to do this unless we made some concession on the potato question. The trade negotiations being then broken off, no further progress was made, and the Ministry of Agriculture have taken no steps to extend the date of permitted entry of vegetables.4. As regards the French agricultural tariff demands, the Minister of Agriculture was prepared to grant certain reductions of duty for defined periods of the year in respect of various descriptions of flowers and for lettuces, endive and chicory. I understand that he would also reluctantly have been prepared to grant, if necessary, some modifications in the duties on strawberries, currants and asparagus; although these matters were the subject of an exchange of view between the experts, no indication of these possible further concessions was given to the French Delegation.o
