I think my oolleague3 will he interested to see the attaohed note by Lord Weir.     I took the opportunity to consult him personally and confidentially as to the proposals for the statutory enforcement of Wage Agreements, both on account of his general ability and knowledge, and on account of his experience as the honorary President of the National Confederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations.W.R .Board of Trade,21st March, 19345 document 15 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHialEHT * SECRET ..P.87(34). COPY KO.QABIKET.Cotton Trade Wages. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.
OOTTOH    TRADE   STAGES.I am not well Informed as to the detailed conditions and organisation of the Cotton industry.General experience In industry may not he a reliable guide in dealing with Lancashire cotton.     A considerable proportion of the operatives are women, and I believe it is the total family income rather than the individual incomes which reflects oontentment or unrest in a Lancashire household.Ootton is still vital in our national economies,   I think we buy  60,000,000 of raw material.   ?/e then manufacture it, then retain all we require for ourselves, and finally export the balance for  100,000,000 - a wonderful national asset II note that &quot;the disloyalty is oaused by a substantial and increasing number of employers (particularly those engaged in the manufacture of the plainer cloths  (i.e. mainly for export)The demand for statutory safeguards to voluntary agreements has been made in the past by certain industries belonging to a particular category, but as far as I am aware, this is the first demand- made by an exporting industry.    I regard this as significant.Criticism has been prevalent, and there appears substantial foundation for it in regard to practice and conduct of this industry both as regards employers and the trade unions.   It is claimed there Is defective organisation on one hand and rigidity In working conditions and adherence to old precedents on the other.It is very definitely our British experience that voluntary agreements arrived at by well organised employers and trade unions are as a rule sane and commonaense reflections of the circumstances and need  of the Industry., and that they are loyally observed and have not required any statutory safeguards,. I feel that if suoh agreements had not reflected the circumstances and needs of the industry, transgression and disloyalty would have taken place.-1-
I personally regard any application for statutory support either as selfish in foundation when made by a sheltered domestic industry or, if made by a competitive industry, as a sign of defective conditions in that industry, and consequently in both oases as representing a claim which should not be granted.     There is nothing more likely to do serious harm than to orystalise by statute an agreement which may turn out in the light of to-day&apos;s conditions to be an economically defective agreement.However, before anyone could seriously Judge this situation it would be necessary to establish very clearly:1.   Is the disloyalty of the substantial and increasing section one of simple wage rate outting, or is it one associated with other conditions of production?   Are the transgressors acting heinously and harming the industry, or are they transgressing something based merely on precedent which may be obsolete in character?   Remember it is sometimes necessary to transgress precedent to lead to better ultimate results.2.   Is the transgression clearly marked as between those who export and those who work for the home market?These two sections may have differing and conflicting interests.    One may not object to a particular set of conditions in an agreement.     He may even ask for it to be rigidly fixed and applied, while the other may see in transgression his only hope for the industry and the workpeople.Assume the demand was agreed to.   Would it help Lancashire industry as a whole?    I suggest that, of all the industries in this country to which rigidity of conditions might safely be applied, lancashire ootton is the last one I would select.   The exact opposite of rigidity or crystallisation is what i3 required.     The breakdown of precedents and practices should be definitely encouraged instead of provided against.When I review the whole field of British industry and consider the universal loyalty in adherence to voluntary wageagreement, I am tempted to suggest that this present demand maybe made, not in the spirit of evolutionary progress but in the- 8-
spirit of desperation.     The general economic position of the industry Is so deplorable that loyalty may have disappeared, and in despair appeal is made for law.   Possibly the demand is merely a single phase or expression of a general disintegration in the Industry.For these reasons I do not like the suggested experiment. More than that, if I were making an experiment in thi3 direotion, the Cotton industry i3 the last I would select because It is the least appropriate, and the results would be of the lea3t conclusive nature and value.I appreciate that there is an aspect of all this which the Cabinet oannot disregard.    &quot;No action&quot;, it is said, will precipitate a very grave crisis.   Has it been thought out what this actually means, presumably a serious strike or look-out? Who will take this strike or look-out action?The overwhelmingly grave crisis is surely the state of the Cotton industry, not this detail of it.On the broadest policy aspect I feel that this experiment, if made, would have a definite weakening effect on the wholeexisting structure of voluntary agreements, a structure which has been and is    of tremendous value to British industry.While conscious of my lack of knowledge of this problem, I make the following suggestion with great diffidence^    I am greatly attracted with the idea cf the three independent commissioners sitting with the original authors of the agreement to hear objections.   In reality this i3 a Court of Enquiry into the general merits of the agreement *    I suggest that such a court be constituted now, and I have the impiession that if it doe3 its job well loyalty will be secured without the necessity of any statute.(Sgd.)
