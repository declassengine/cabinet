CABIN K T      PROCEDURE.TICS RETENTION&quot; BY CABINET MINISTERS OF THEIR CABINET PAPERS ON LEAVING OFFICE.1.     The circumstances connected   with the serious leakage of the contents of Cabinet documents in the case of Mr. Lansbury&apos;s biography of his father (Mr. George Lansbury) raises the question whether some change should not be made in the existing rule under which, on retirement from Office, a Cabinet Minister is at liberty, if he so desires, to retain all Cabinet documents (but not C.I.D.  documents) circulated to him during his term of Office.2.      In the preface to his biography, Mr. Edgar Lansbury admits   that his father had &quot;lent him some letters and papers from which I have quoted&quot;, and it may be assumed that, in fact, Mr. Edgar Lansbury obtained free access    to his father&apos;s Cabinet Papers with the result that he was able to reproduce in the biography long verbatim extracts from very secret memoranda circulated in 1930 and 1931 to the Cabinet by Mr. George Lansbury when First Commissioner of Works.- 3.      At the instance of the Attorney-General,  the publishers of the biography have undertaken to recall all copies, and a summons alleging contravention of the Official Secrets Acts has been served on Mr,   Sdgar Lansbury.    There remains the general question whether    the Cabinet procedure on the subject should not be tightened up.Existing 4. Under an early ruling in 1908 of the Committee of Imperial cedure.**. Defence,    the Secretary was instructed to recover all recordsD- of that Committee from Ministers on leaving Office.      Thisments.r\iling has never been changed, and C.I.D. documents are-1-
recovered by the Cabinet Office as a matter of routine from out-going Ministers.     There is a further rule that ex-members of the Committee of Imperial Defence can have access to docu-merits issued during the time that they were members of the Committee.jnet 5.      The practice in regard to Cabinet documents has varied.u.r.ents. . , ,In pre-war days, when by   comparison such documents were very few and far between (and when there was no Cabinet Secretariat),it was the custom for Ministers to retain their documents.c5.      The question was considered by the War Cabinet in August, 1917 (War Cabinet 21?) when emphasis was laid on the grave dangers of Cabinet Papers getting into wrong hands after the retirement or death of ex-Cabinet Ministers.     The War Cabinet in effect decided that on leaving Office Ministers should either hand over their Cabinet Papers to their successors^ or should return papers not so handed over to the Cabinet Office. For    the text of the actual War Cabinet decision see Appendix I.7.     At the first Meeting on 4th November,  1919, of the firstpost-war Cabinet, the Cabinet had before them certain draft instructions to the Secretary on the subject of procedure.These draft instructions had been based on the procedure of theWar Cabinet, and they included the following paragraph:-&quot;Cabinet Minutes and papers are not the personal property of members, and on a Minister leaving Office it is the duty of the secretary    to recover    from him, or in the event of his death from his Executors, ail Cabinet Papers issued to him from the Cabinet Offices.&quot;S.      The Cabinet decided that this paragraph should be deleted from the draft instructions.      The Cabinet considered that secrecy was &quot;safeguarded by the rule that no-one is entitled+ This was   applicable of course only to War Cabinet Ministers,  it could have no   application to Pest War Party Administrations.
2P 0* to make use or Cabinet documents without the permission of the King&quot;.9.      The effect of this    last mentioned decision was,by implication,  that Ministers on leaving Office becameentitled to take away with them their Cabinet papers, andthis procedure has been followed in the case of eachsuccessive Administration,  the practice being for theCabinet of each Administration at its last Meeting to adopta Conclusion in the following terms:-&quot;To adhere to the procedure of their predecessors in regard to Cabinet documents:    that is to say, Ministers should retain such Cabinet documents as they desire, on the understanding that as ex-Ministers they could have access to Cabinet Minutes and other documents issued during their   term of office.&quot;10.    A conclusion in the above terms was adopted at the last Meeting of   the Labour Cabinet on 24th August, 1931 (Cabinet 47 (31) Conclusion 1).Ministerial    1.1.    The practice actually adopted by individual Ministers practice.has greatly varied.     A small minority retain no papers and return all their papers to this Office,  either periodically when in Office, or in bulk when they leave Office.      The usual practice, however,  is for Ministers to return certain Papers and to retain others;    the retained Papers being: as a rule those of the greatest importance and of the greatest interest to the particular Minister.      It is, however, by no means unusual for Ministers to retain all their Papers, and. this practice seems to have been generally followed by the Ministers in the late Labour Government,      For example, Mr. George Lansbury took away with him all his Cabinet Minutes and Cabinet and Cabinet Committee memoranda, etc.
case for     12.    , The only argument advanced for the retention   of -ntion.Papers is that they are the personal property of the ex-Minister, and that it is convenient for him to be able to refer as required to the records of his period of Office. It may be arguable whether Papers should be regarded as the personal property of individual Ministers&quot;? but in any case there is no real substance in the argument.     An ex-Minister is always at liberty to see the Papers in question at this Office, where they are kept in convenient form properly indexed, etc.      It is much easier for an ex-Minister to ob-tain the information he requires by recourse to this Office, than to have to search among his (as a rule) unindexed and unsorted Papers, and the more Papers he takes away, the greater is his difficulty in finding what he wants.     Mr. Lloyd George, who retained most of his Papers, fines that in practice it is much more convenient to refer to the records here.se against 13.      On the other hand, the arguments which have been ion.advanced in the past against the retention of Paperscontinue to gain strength with the lapse of time.      these arguments may be summarised as followst-(l) There is no certainty, even in the lifetime ofan ex-Cabinet Minister, that his&apos;Papers may not fall intowrong hands and be put to improper uses.      The Lansburycase is a striking example of what may happen with the aquiescence of the ex-Minister himself.      In some cases,no doubt, an ex-Minister will be able to arrange for the satisfactory safe custody of his Papers, but&apos;in many casesthis will not be done, and there is a grave risk ofCabinet Minutes and other extremely secret documentsgetting by accident, theft, or design, into the possessionof unscrupulous persons who would have no compunction in-4-x The War Cabinet held that they were not (see Appendix I (a)).
selling them to the highest foreign, or other bidder. Many of these Papers would fetch very high prices from foreign agents, newspapers, and others, and when, as is hound to happen sooner or later, it becomes generally known/   that they are held in large numbers   by ex-Ministers (or their representatives) in their homes, there will be a loss of Papers, a grave public scandal, and the public in-terest may be acutely prejudiced,,(2) Every precaution is taken to safeguard the secret character of these Papers so far as this Office and the Departments are concerned.      Elaborate measures are taken to secure that, even after very many years,  these Papers will not be available for public inspection with other Government records preserved in the Record Office.      The object of these safeguards and precautions will be wholly frustrated if other copies of the Papers are to be left in the hands of private persons unable to protect them.(3) There is no logical ground for differentiating in this matter between Cabinet Papers and C.I.D. Papers. This is particularly true with regard to Cabinet Papers dealing with Defence and kindred topics.      Such Papers are concerned with the concluding stages (including actual decisions) of the most important and critical aspects of Defence policy, and from this point of view there is a stronger case for specially safeguarding them than for specially safeguarding, as we do,  the C.I.D, Papers.      To name a recent example, the Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee is clearly a document which should never, in any circumstances, be retained by a Minister after leaving Office.-5-/ Mr. Edgar Lansbury&apos;s admission (see paragraph 2 above; in itself draws the attention of evilly disposed persons to the fact that Mr. George Lansbury has Papers of this kind in his possession.
(4) Whatever arguments there may he for allowing ex-Cabinet Ministers, while living,  to retain their Papers, I can find none for allowing sucn. Papers to remain in the possession of their executors or families after their death.      In view, however, of the Cabinet decision of 1919 quoted above, we are precluded from recovering Cabinet Papers belonging to deceased ex-Cabinet Ministers. There have been cases in the past where such Papers have been sold and have passed into the possession of second-hand booksellers and others.In Appendix II will be found the names of 21 deceased ex-Cabinet Ministers who have held Office since 1919. In most, if not all,  of these cases, the Ministers retained Papers on leaving Office, and these Papers are now in the possession of persons who can have no possible claim to hold them, whose responsibility,  in fact, for their safe custody is negligible, and who probably have very little idea of the nature and importance of the Papere or of the grave consequences to the country and, inciden-tally to themselves,  of the Papers going astray.-Suggested 14.      If it is decided to make some change, it wouldalterationsin pro- seem that the only way of meeting the difficulties men-cedure.tioned in the preceding paragraph is to assimilate in future the procedure in regard to Cabinet Papers to the procedure which has throughout been enforced in regard to CLU Papers, i.e. , to recover all Cabinet Papers from Ministers on leaving Office, on the understanding that ex-Cabinet Ministers can always have access to Cabinet Minutes and other Papers issued to them during the time that they were members of the Cabinet.-6-
15.     It is also submitted that authority should now be obtained to recover from the representatives of deceased Cabinet Ministers, all post-war Cabinet Papers in the possession of those representatives.160     It seems clear that a less stringent arrangement would be open to one or more of the objections named above.     For er.ample3 it might be thought that it would be sufficient if, in the normal course. Cabinet Ministers returned their Cabinet Papers on leaving Office,, retaining, h ow ever, du r j 13g their 1 i fa ti me, certain P ape r s of special interest to themselves.      I feel sure, however, . that it would be most difficult, if not impossible, in practice to limit this exception to documents of an unimportant character.       Experience shows that if Ministers retain documents, they want to retain Cabinet Minutes end other specially secret Papers.      It is precisely Papers of this kind which cannot be properly protected and safeguarded if they are in private han&amp;So170     There remains the difficult question of the outstanding Papers in the possession of living ex-Cabinet Ministers, all of whom will have taken them away under the express authority of the Cabinets of which they were members.     If the changes proposed above are adopted as regards the future, I think that we should be authorised to write to these ex-Ministers explaining the new procedure, end inviting them to co-operate by returning their Papers here to be kept for them in safe custody in this Office. Some would doubtless refuse,but I suspect that the majority would be only too glad to be rid of the responsibility and trouble of storing the Papers.      In any case the area of possible mischief would be reduced.
18a It is therefore suggested ;-(a) That it shall he the duty of all Cabinet Ministers on vacating office to return forthwith all Cabinet Minutes and Papers issued to them while in office to the Secretary to the Cabinet;     and it shall be the dutyof the Secretary to the Cabinet to recover all such Papers accordingly.(b) That the  same procedure shall be followed in the case of Ministers outside the Cabinet on vacating office.(c) That ex-Cabinet Ministers shall continue to have the right of access to all Cabinet Minutes end Papers issued to  them during the time that they were members of theC abi ne t.(d) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to invite the representatives of deceased ex-Cabinet Ministers to return forthwith to the Cabinet Offices all post-war Cabinet Minutes and Papers in their possession..(e) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to write to living ex-Cabinet Ministers inviting them to co-operate by returning their Cabinet Minutes and papers to  the Cabinet Offices to be kept therein safe custody for them.190      If the decision could be taken and implemented by a National Government? it is   highly probable that it would be accepted by subsequent Governments without question.(Signed) R.
