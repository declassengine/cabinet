2&apos;o2S DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTYOP HISBHITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).rn. 106 .(34) .COPY NO.-VISEC ABINE T.COMMITTEE ON JAPANESETRADE COMPETITION.REPORT.1. At their Meeting on March 19th, 1934 (Cabinet 10 (34) Conclusion 6) the Cabinet agreed that a Committee composed as followsj-The president of the Board of Trade (In the Chair)The Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsThe Secretary of State for the colonies the First Commissioner of works should be set up to consider from all points of view the economic and political consequences that might he involved in the event of the breakdown of the negotiations between United Kingdom and Japanese cotton and rayon industrialists.2.      The facts of the problem are stated in the opening paragraphs of the printed Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the President of the Board of Trade on the 20th March (CP. 81 (34)).      In paragraph 3 of that Memorandum are set out various courses of action which the Government will probably be ^pressed to take, and the arguments for and against the various courses are summarised in the concluding paragraphs of the Memorandum.3.      On the 16th March following the breakdown of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japanese textile industrialists the President of the Board of Trade handed to the Japanese Ambassador a Memorandum in which he asked the Japanese Government for. their proposals on the situation-1-
arising out of the collapse of the industrial discussions. The reply of the Japanese Orovernment, which was received on March 30th, is mainly devoted to general expressions of good intentions.      It contains, however, no proposals hut concludes with an offer to consider any proposals which vse may put forward, for the equitable adjustment of the position.      In the view of H.M. Ambassador at Tokio the Japanese Government are anxious to meet us if they can do so without making too great a sacrifice.4.      The Manchester Chamber of Commerce are of opinion that there is nothing to be gained by further negotiations with the Japanese at the present stage.     Having regard to the terms of the Japanese reply and our previous experience of discussions with them there is a good deal to be said for this view.5.      There are only two alternatives;-(1)    To make a proposal to the Japanese Government with a view to seeking an agreed basis for subsequent negotiations;(2)    To inform the Japanese Government that there has been no Indication, either during the industrial discussions or now, that they or their industries are prepared to sake concessions of a kind which would make it possible to conclude an agreement 5    His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore come reluctantly to the conclusion that no useful purpose will be served by pur-suing the discussions further, and they will therefore be obliged te resume liberty of action.6.     As regards (1) we agree with the view of the President of the Board of Trade that  it is very improbable that the Japanese will be ready to meet us in a way that we could regard as satisfactory.      In any event it is imperative that the Government should not become committed to formal negotiations with the Japanese Government unless there is a good prospect of a successful issue,  i.e. the basis of negotiations should first be agreed.      It must be recognised
that discussions with the Japanese would doubtless occupy several months during which our hands would, &quot;be tied, at any rate as regards action in the export markets and,-possibly,  as regards the home market.7.      A possible basis of negotiations would be to ask the Japanese Government, on the basis of the present volume of world trade, to restrict their total exports of piece goods (other than to India and the United Kingdom) &quot;by means of powers which they already possess, to the total reached in 1955i    further that for any increase in United Kingdom exports above this 1955 total, Japan would be allotted a proportionate increase, which however would he less than the United Kingdom increase.      The proposal would exclude India from the scope of any agreement, and. we should, also propose to exclude the United Kingdom and Japanese home markets respectively, as in any event it will be necessary (as stated in paragraph 15 of CP. 81 (54)) to be free to proceed at once with the revision of the silk and rayon duties.8.      The proposal would probably be criticised by Lancashire as not going far enoiigh.      It is questionable whether Japan would accept it (any less offer would certainly have no chance of success) and it would, no doubt,  in any event, be necessary, in exchange for an undertaking of this kind, for us to agree to hold our hands in the Colonies.9.     With regard to (8) it must be recognised that the measure of any action which we are in a position to take is extremely small.      Sir P. Lindley has suggested that we should make an estimate of the amount of restriction or damage which we should, be able to inflict on Japanese trade by means of action in the Colonies and in co-operation with the Dominions and. foreign countries.     The total Japanese
textile trade to the Colonies in which we can expect to take action was only about 100 million yards (out of a total of over 2000 million yards) in 1932.     As explained in C.F. 81 (34) there are very grave political and other objections to any attempt on our part to form a bloc of the Dominions and foreign countries in order to put pressure on Japan.10.    We agree with the President of the Board of Trade that, for the reasons given in paragraph 9 of CP. Si (54), the denunciation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty would serve no useful purpose and &quot;would involve substantial economic and political dangers.     Without denunciation it will be possible for us to take action under the &quot;Report, when ready, of the Import Duties Advisory Committee on the silk and rayon duties,  and with quotas and increased preferences in Colonial markets.11.    In the British West African Colonies we shall be free after 16th May next to discriminate specifically against Japan, either by quotas or duties.      We cannot take action in East Africa, either by preference or quota, so long as we remain bound by the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. We have requested, the Departments concerned to advise us as to the exact position in regard, to East Africa and the measures which it would be open to us to take in certain events.      As regards the other Colonial markets we are advised that,excluding the Straits Settlements and Hong Kong, which are entrepot centres, action could be taken for^thwith by quotas which are not discriminatory in form, instead   of waiting for a year to elapse while notice to terminate the obligations of the Colonies under the Anglo-Japanese Treaty is given.
\m12.       While Ceylon, an important Lancashire colonial market, might he less unwilling to introduce quotas than she has been to give us a preference on cotton goods, it is not improbable that the Legislative Council may refuse to institute a quota system,  in which case the Secretary of State for the Colonies is prepared to override the viev/s of the Council and impose such a system by Order.      Such action may raise constitutional issues, but we attach so much importance to the inclusion of Ceylon in the Colonial Quota Scheme that we trust that the Cabinet will authorise the Secretary of State for the Colonies to override, if necessary, the views of the Legislative Council in regard to this matter.13. There are two objections to abandoning all idea ofan agreement with Japan to which we wish to draw attention: (a) the effect of continued unrestricted competition will be to enable consuming countries to put their markets up to auction between ourselves and Japan;    we should then find ourselves in the position as in the Dutch East Indies (and possibly in Egypt and in other countries)  of having to look for substantial concessions to make in return, in order to maintain the status quo;    (b)  countries which besides being-markets for cotton goods are also producers are likely if exposed to continued unrestricted competition frcm Japan, to impose severe restrictions on imports which might keep out our goods as well as those of Japan.    Neither of these developments could be to the advantage either of ourselves or of Japan.14. There are, of course,  disadvantages in either ofthe two courses open to us, but there is one further course which would be worse than either, and that would be to embark on governmental negotiations and to fail.     We
agree with the president of the Board of Trade in doubting whether in their present frame of mind the Japanese are prepared to make any concessions of substance, and in think-ing that we shall in the end be obliged, in any case, to fall back on course (2), and in these circumstances we have decided to recommend its adoption forthwith to the Cabinet.15. If the Cabinet accept our recommendations, wesuggest that the proposed communication to the Japanese Government should be deferred until progress has been made with the arrangements for the institution of the quota system in the various Colonial markets.16. We submit the following conclusions and recommend-ations to the Cabinet :-(l) We doubt whether in their present frame of mind the Japanese are prepared to make any concessions of substance, and we do not think therefore that any useful purpose would be served in making a proposal to the Jpanese Government with a view to seeking an agreed basis for subsequent negotiations.(2) We recommend the Cabinet to adopt the only alternative policy, namely that the Japanese Government should be informed that there has been no indication, either during the indus-trial discussions or now, that they or their industries are prepared to make concessions of a kind which would make it possible to conclude an agreement;    His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore come reluctantly to the conclusion that no useful purpose will be served by pursuing the discussions further, and they are therefore obliged to resume liberty of action.(3) If the Cabinet adopt the proposal in ^2) above, we recommend that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised confidentially to arrange forthwith with the various Colonial authorities concerned for the institution of a quota system which will not in form be discriminatory against Japan, except in the West African Colonies, and that at the appropriate $amerit xhs Japanese Government should be notified as in (2)  above,,
(4) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should he authorised to secure the adoption of a quota system in Ceylon by the use of the Governor&apos;s power to legislate in matters of &quot;paramount importance&quot; if this should prove necessary owing to the refusal of. the Legislative Council to accept such a system.(5) To take note that the Treaty position in regard to East Africa is being examined &quot;by the Departments concerned, and that the Committee propose to submit a further Report on the subject in due course.Signed, on behalf of the Committee WALTER RIINCIMAN, Chairman.2, whitehall Ga gardens, S.W.1, 12th April, 1934.-7-
