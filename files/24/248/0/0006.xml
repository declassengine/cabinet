THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT. SECRET. COPY NO.d.p.7iOOCABINET. ROAD   ACCID5INTS.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;memorandum by the Minister of Transport.The Cabinet authorised me on the l6th January, 1934-, (Conclusion 10) to prepare a Bill on the lines of my memorandum (CP. 512(33)) subject to further consideration of the definition of a &quot;built-up area&quot;  (as one where a system of street lighting is provided) for the purpose of applying a speed limit to private cars and motor cycles.Inquiry has shewn that there are certain stretches of road in certain areas which are lit by street lighting although not &quot;built-up&quot;, and, as the lighting of roads increases, there will be more.It will therefore, I think, be desirable to empower highway authorities, subject to the consent of the Minister of Transport, to take such stretches of road out of the new restriction;    and in order to meet the possibility that a particular highway authority might fail to use this power properly, I propose that a like power should be granted to me.      It is also desirable to give highway authorities power, subject to the Minister&apos;3 consent, to declare streets to be &quot;built-up&quot;, although there is no system of public street lighting, in order to meet the case of unlighted villages on important roads.     Both the specially excluded stretches of road and those specially brought within the restriction will be suitably indicated,I seek authority for incorporation of provisions in the     : draft Bill accordingly.(Intd.)&apos; O.F.G.S.12th March, 1954.
