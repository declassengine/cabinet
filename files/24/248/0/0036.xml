Section 1.[T 3752/39/374] No. 1.Sir John Simon to S-ir R. Lindsay (Washington).(No. 297.)Sir, Foreign Office, April 3, 1934.I ASKED Mr. Bingham to see me to-day about the extradition of Jacob Factor. He expressed himself as shocked to hear that we had already spent some  20,000 on fees to American lawyers to secure the order for extradition. He said that he had not realised that there was a difference between British and American practice in such matters, and the Attorney-General, who was present at our interview, confirmed that in this country, when proceedings were taken to secure the extradition to the United States of a fugitive from justice, the necessary work was done by Treasury counsel without expense to the American Government. We explained, however, that this was not the point on which it was necessary to make representations through the Ambassador to Washington. The seriousness of the situation was that, although after a series of appeals spread over a couple of years the order of the Supreme Court had at last been obtained for this man&apos;s extradition, he none the less remained at lai&apos;ge in the United States, on the ground that after he had been kidnapped and the kidnappers had been convicted largely on Factor&apos;s evidence, the kidnappers were appealing, and, in the event of a new trial being ordered, Factor&apos;s evidence against them might have to be repeated. I told the Ambassador that we felt that so much time had elapsed since Factor&apos;s extradition was ordered, that it was becoming impossible to wait any longer. The English courts had long ago convicted and punished Factor&apos;s associates, but he was the head of the gang, and if he escaped owing to these dilatory methods, nothing less than a gross miscarriage of justice would result. The Attorney-General pointed out that it was impossible for the authorities here to detain the witnesses who would give evidence against Factor indefinitely, and the lapse of time was already so great that the freshness of their evidence was seriously prejudiced. We therefore had to decide whether we must abandon the whole thing, in spite of the large expenditure already incurred, rather than persist in what appeared to be a vain chase. Sir Thomas Inskip added that it was disturbing to read American unofficial messages which seemed to suggest that Factor deserved indulgence because he had been useful in securing the conviction of the kidnappers. Approaches had, in fact, been made, apparently on his behalf, to buy off the prosecution by an enormous money payment running into six figures, but, of course, the British authorities had refused to pay any attention to such suggestions.2. The Ambassador expressed himself as much impressed by what we had told him, and as deploring the existence of a system of appeals which made such delay possible. He asked for a note of the relevant dates, and undertook to com-municate with his Government on the matter. He pointed out that the order for extradition was made by the Federal authorities, whereas Factor &apos;s detention in America on the ground that he might be wanted again as a witness would apparently be due to the State authorities, and I understand from Mr. Bingham that if the Federal authorities put their foot down their decision would prevail.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.[88 c-1]
