* Circulated to the Cabinet toy direction t 235ThQ Secretary of State for Foreign AJPfelTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTLEAGUE OF NATIONS (Disarmament). March 27, 1934.CONFIDENTIAL Section 1.[W 3178/1/98] No. 1.Sir John Simon to Lord Tyrrell (Paris).(No. 532.)My Lord, Foreign Office, March 27, 1934.M. CORBIN told me to-day that he had communicated with Paris on the subject of the questions I had raised with him, as recorded in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 464 to you of the 19th March. He had reported that I was speaking only personally, and the reply which he now gave me should also be treated as informally reflecting the French attitude and not as a definite declaration by the French Government. Indeed, I rather inferred from what the Ambassador said that the views he was expressing were those of officials at the Quai d&apos;Orsay rather than the result of consideration in the French Cabinet.2. The first question dealt with the difference between &apos;&apos; guarantees of execution &apos;&apos; and the practical conception of &apos;&apos; collective security.&apos;&apos; The Ambassador contented himself on this head by saying that the distinction was fully appreciated and the French view as to the nature of the distinction coincided with that which I had expressed. The second question was as to the possibility of envisaging a form of guarantee which would not be world-wide, but which would be entered into reciprocally by European countries. The Ambassador said that he thought that the French Government would not be averse to this idea, but they thought supervision should apply universally. Lastly, there was the third question as to the ideas of the French Government on the possibility of putting the above concept-tions into application. In this connexion the Ambassador referred me to the document which the French Government handed to Mr. Henderson last December (&quot;League of Nations (Disarmament)&quot; print, December 16, 1933, Section 1), which, in the present state of the negotiations, sufficiently defined their position.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.[61 dd-1]
