THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT v Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.SECRET. Copy No.   42G.P. 105 (34).CABINET.THE NEXT IMPERIAL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. -THE last Imperial Conference held in London was in October 1930. Since then there has been the Ottawa Conference of 1932 and, of course, representative Ministers from all the Dominions, and a strong Indian delegation, attended the World Economic Conference in 1933. But the practice is to hold Imperial Conferences every three or four years and accordingly the time seems fast approaching when the possibilities with regard to the holding of another Imperial Conference in London ought to be considered.: 2. I imagine that, from our point of view, a Conference in 1936 would be politically inconvenient. If, therefore, there is to be another Imperial Conference during the term of the present Parliament, it looks as though it must be held next year. Apart from other considerations, it occurs to me that the twenty-fifth anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession, which will fall in May 1935, would afford an admirable occasion for the assembly in London,.in the course of the year, of all His Majesty&apos;s Prime Ministers.3. As regards the programme for such a Conference, it is to be hoped that it would not be necessary, as in 1930, to concentrate attention on the constitutional aspects of inter-Imperial relations. But the general situation of the world, both in Europe and the Far East, seems likely, so far as can be foreseen at present, to afford ample material for discussions of the greatest consequence on foreign policy.4. There is also the question of the reform of the League of Nations, which, I imagine, cannot be left in abeyance much longer, whether or not the present Disarmament Conference succeeds in bringing about a Convention. This question has, of course, a special interest for the Dominions, and, indeed, might well afford the best starting-point for a general review of the international situation.5. Moreover, it must be remembered that under the London Naval Treaty of 1930 a further conference on limitation of naval armaments is due to take place in 1935, and it would clearly be convenient, if it were at all possible, that arrangements should be made to discuss in advance with Dominion and Indian delegates the major problems arising, both technical and political.6. On the economic side, the time should be ripe next year for at any rate a preliminary survey of the results of the Ottawa Agreements and for the consideration of future Imperial economic policy (for example, the United Kingdom promise of free entry for certain Dominion dairy products is for a period of three years from 1932). Several general questions in relation to trade with foreign countries, such as, for example, those arising out of Japanese competition, also seem likely to require examination.7. There are also important questions as to the development of communi-cations, especially in relation to air services and shipping services, which are likely to need discussion.. [9906]
8. As regards the political situation in the various Dominions; elections are due in Australia and New Zealand later this year or early in 1935. The next election in the Union of South Africa is not due until 1938, unless it is decided to hold a special election in connection with the proposed &quot;fusion&quot; between General Hertzog&apos;s and General Smuts&apos;s parties. In Canada an election is. due by July 1935 at the latest, but there is no information yet as to the precise date at which it will be held. Which of the elections will result in a change; of Government remains to be seen.9. If there is to be an Imperial Conference in 1935, the two possible alternative dates would appear to be the early summer or the autumn (say October). Considerations in favour of the former of these dates would be (i) the advantage of a date which would enable the representatives of the Dominions and India to be present in London at the time of the anniversary of the King&apos;s Accession, and(ii) the desirability of holding the Imperial Conference before the meetingof the Naval Conference.Considerations in favour of an autumn conference would be (i) the likelihood, as I understand, that the passage&apos; of the new legislationcontemplated as regards India would not be completed till late in the session;(ii) the improbability that any earlier date would suit Canada;(iii) the fact that experience has shown that a date in the autumn is generallymore convenient both for the Dominions and from the parliamentary point of view, for ourselves.10. If my colleagues agree, I would suggest that, as a first step, the Prime Minister might send an informal message to the Dominion Prime Ministers proposing a meeting of the Imperial Conference next year and inviting their views as to the most convenient time of year for its assembling. Concurrently, the Secretary of State for India might sound the Government of India. ...11. The position as regards the Irish Free State is difficult; but on the whole I think our wisest course would be to include the Irish Free State in any general approach made to the Dominions. It seems to me that for us to invite them would be the right move from our point of view whether they accept or whether they refuse to come. Not to invite them would, I am sure, be a mistake. When the next general election in the Irish Free State will take place is, of course, a question of considerable uncertainty.(Initialled)   J. H. T.Dominions Office, April 10, 1934.
