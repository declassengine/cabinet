[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1934.secret.CP. 98 (34). Copy No. 3...J.CABINET.Proposed Legislation to deal with Communism in India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of correspondence which I have recently had with the Government of India on the subject of communist activity in India.It will be seen from this correspondence that the Government of India view with concern the evidences of renewed communist activity in India. Owing to the break m.p. of the communist organisations caused by the proceedings in the Meerut case, communism had been at a low ebb in India for the last few years, but there has recently been a gradual revival of the movement. The Communist International is once more turning its attention to the possibilities of stirring up trouble in India and has at the moment about 40 Indians under training in schools in Moscow and else-where, while a few Indians trained in this way have already returned to India. At the same time there are indications of a possible combination of the communists with the terrorists and other revolutionary organisations such as the Sikh Ghadr Party in the United States of America. The danger is perhaps most serious in Bombay, which was, with Bengal, the main centre of disturbance during the communist troubles in 1928 and 1929. But several other Provinces are also-affected and there is general agreement that though the situation is not of immediate gravity it might become so at any moment should any particular ground for agitation present itself. Such an opportunity might, for instance, occur at the difficult time of the introduction of the new Constitution.In view of this communist menace, which they regard as a real one, the Government of India have examined the question whether the powers they possess under the existing law are adequate to deal with it and, after consultation with Local Governments, they have reached the conclusion that they are not. The Indian Penal Code contains provisions which give adequate powers to meet seditious propaganda and revolutionary conspiracies, but it does not cover the ordinary type of communist propaganda, i.e. propaganda directed to the destruction of the existing economic organisation. Moreover, judicial proceedings under the Penal Code instituted against a number of persons charged with &quot; conspiracy to deprive the King-Emperor of his sovereignty over British India &quot; is a most unsatisfactory means of dealing with communist agitators as the experience of the Meerut case has shown. There is also in force the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908, which enables Government to declare unlawful subversive associations, but as the Govern-inent of India point out it is often difficult to bring a communist association in its earlier stages under the terms of this Act, and it is important that there should he power to deal at an early stage with communist associations and individual members of such associations. Finally, it is highly desirable that the Government of India should have power to deal with non-Indian communist emissaries sent in from outside, such, lor instance, as Spratt and Bradley, who were the most prominent leaders in the Meerut case. As matters stand at present there is no Immigration Act in India, and the Government of India have no power to deport British subjects who are found to be conducting subversive agitation.The Government of India have therefore submitted for my approval a draft Bill which will arm them with the necessary powers to deal with the communist agitation. The main provisions of this Bill may be summarised as follows : (1) The Governor-General or Local Governments are empowered to declare unlawful an organisation &quot;which advocates or promotes or has as one of its objects the advocacy or promotion of any activities designed or calculated directly or indirectly to bring about by the use of force or violence or threat of force or violence the overthrow of or any change in the existing industrial agrarian or economic structure or the overthrow of or any change in the existing form of government.&quot;2704      65   4.34
(2) Local Governments are given power to restrict the movements of persons who there are reasonable grounds for believing are members of unlawful associations or are acting in association with such organisations outside British India. In the case of British subjects other than Indians, power is given to order removal from India.(3) Local Governments are given power to control or confiscate money belonging to unlawful associations, whether inside India or coming in from abroad. With a view to investigating the accounts of suspects the Government may order banks, &amp;c, to furnish any necessary information.(4) Power is taken to detain or forfeit any communist literature.(5) All orders passed under (2) above are to be referred for scrutiny to two judges. The judges will report to Government whether they are satisfied that the person against whom an order is passed is actually engaged in furthering the work of an unlawful association, and on receipt of the judges&apos; report Government will pass such orders as appear to them to be just or proper.(6) Penalties are prescribed for (a) being a member or acting in association with the activities of an unlawful association (up to five years&apos; imprisonment) ;(b) for distributing or being in possession of forfeited publications (up to three years&apos; imprisonment) ;(c) for disobedience [of orders passed under (2) or (3) above (up to two years&apos; imprisonment).It is probably too late to introduce the Bill formally this session.   If so the Government of India propose to publish it in the Gazette as soon as possible and to refer it to a Committee at the next meeting of the Legislature in August or September.   In either case time would be given to Local Governments for considering the details of the Bill and to the public to form an opinion on the merits of the question before the Bill comes up for discussion.   The Government of India regard it as important that their proposals should be fully discussed and considered by the public, for such discussions -will serve to bring home to them the reality of the danger and will also, they hope, tend to create a public opinion against communism. I presume from this programme that the Government of India intend to leave the matter to the decision of the Legislature and that if the Legislature refuses to pass the Bill there will be no question of certification unless of course the situation develops unfavourably while the Bill is under consideration, in which case no doubt the matter would have to be furthur considered.. At the same time the provisions of the Bill are wide and far reaching, in  particular the  attempt to define the ultimate,  objects  of communism and to declare them to be unlawful, and the reactions to legislation of this character both in India and in this country may be considerable.   On the whole I am inclined to agree to the Government of India&apos;s plan, which will enable them to test Indian opinion before they finally commit themselves to proceeding with the Bill. I am, however, very anxious to have the views of my colleagues before I send any definite instructions to the Government of India.India Office, S. II.April 1934.Letter from Government of India, Home Department, to India Office.New Delhi,Sir, 13th February 1934.I am directed to enclose for the information of the Secretary of State a copy of an express letter, No. F. 7/11/34 Poll., dated 8th February 1934, with its enclosures, addressed by the Home Department to Local Governments on the subject of legislation against communism. A draft Bill has been prepared and forms an enclosure to this letter0 ; and Local Governments are being asked to give their opinions on the main question whether legislation of this character is required and whether the general lines of the draft are suitable and likely to be effective.2. It will be seen from paragraph. 10 of the express letter that if it is decided, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, after considering the views of Local Governments, to proceed with the legislation, the Government of India propose to introduce a Bill in the Legislative Assembly in the present session, i.e. early in April, and, in view of this, they have asked for the opinions of Local Governments by* Not printed.
10th March. If the Secretary of State has at this stage any provisional comments or criticisms to make on the general question raised or on the general lines of the Bill, the Government of India would be glad if they might receive them in time to take them into consideration together with the opinions of Local Governments. They regret that the time available for a decision will be short, but they will arrange for the opinions of Local Governments and their own final opinion to be communicated to the Secretary of State as soon as possible after 10th March.I have &amp;c,M. G. Hallett,The Under Secretary of State for India. Secretary to the Government of India.Letter from Government of India, Home Department, to all Local governments and Administrations.New Delhi, 8th February 1934.The Government of India have again had under consideration the question of legislation to deal with communism, and a copy of a letter, No. S.D. 3132, dated 21st June 1933, from the Government of Bombay on this subject is enclosed.0 This question was considered in 1928, when communist activities had developed to a very marked extent and were becoming a danger to the peace and tranquillity of India, and I am to invite attention to Home Department letter No. 1007, dated the 18th August 1928, and to the notification No. S. 287, dated 12th April 1929, with which was published the Public Safety Ordinance, 1929, after two attempts to obtain by legislation the powers considered necessary had failed. At that time Government had secured sufficient evidence of communist activities in India to institute a case, the Meerut conspiracy case, against 31 communist conspirators, which has only recently been completed.2. The history of communism both before and after the institution of the Meerut case is given in detail in the second edition of the book entitled &quot; Communism in India,&quot; which was compiled in the Intelligence Bureau of the Home Department and issued last year. This book gives a very complete survey of communist activities both in India and adjacent countries ; it shows the very grave situation which had arisen in 1928-29, particularly in industrial centres in Bombay and Bengal, the temporary disorganisation of the communist conspiracy as a result of the institution of the Meerut case and the gradual revival which has taken place in more recent years. It brings out clearly the connection between communism and terrorism in Bengal and between communism and other subversive movements such as the Ghadr movement in the Punjab. . Further details of more recent activities of communists will be found in the weekly reports issued by the Intelligence Bureau, but before giving a short appreciation of the present position it is necessary to refer very briefly to the findings in the Meerut case.3. The findings of the Sessions Judge and. the High Court fully supported the view of the position taken by the Government of India in 1928 that &quot; the general policy of the communist movement is to rouse a spirit of discontent and lawlessness in the masses, whether industrial or agricultural, with the ultimate object of destroying hy violence both the Government established by law and the present economic organisation of society and substituting what they describe as the dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;   The findings may be summarised as follows : (1) It is conclusively proved that throughout the period under consideration there has been in existence in Russia an organisation, known as the Communist International, which has had as its aim to bring about throughout the world a revolution or revolutions for the overthrow of the existing-Governments. This overthrow is expected and intended to be brought about by armed uprisings.(2) It has been clearly established that the Communist International works to that end through (a) various committees of its own, such as the Colonial Committee ;(b) branches, such as the Communist Party of Great Britain ; and(c) auxiliary  organisations,  as,  for   example,   the   League  against Imperialism, the Young Comnrunist League, &amp;c.Some of these bodies are nominally independent, but in reality they are all controlled by the Communist International and are subject to it.* Not printed.
(3) The objects of the Communist International and of all these other bodies are set out in their official publications and other documents which contain a clear account of the methods prescribed for carrying on work and propaganda leading up to the main objective, e.g. in the programmes of the Communist International. The High Court, referring to these programmes, say : &quot; The whole programme from beginning to end shows without a shadow of doubt that the programme is the overthrow of the existing order of society and Government by the use of force with ultimate resort to arms.&quot;(4) Specifically with regard to India it was established that the Communist. International decided that India offered a suitable field for its operations as being one of the weak links in the capitalist chain. Through the agency of the Communist Party of Great Britain it had been sending literature, advice and instructions, and also a number of agents, such as Spratt, Bradley and others, who have been following the traditional methods of communist penetration and propaganda.(5) The methods which have been laid down as a programme of work for the revolution in India include (a) incitement generally of antagonism between Capital and Labour;(b) creation of Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Parties, Youth Leagues, &amp;c, superficially for the benefit of their members, but in reality for the purpose of propaganda ;(c) in the case of existing Trade Unions, political bodies and the like, their capture in the communist interest by the introduction of fractions consisting of communists ;(d) encouragement of strikes, hartals and similar demonstrations ;(e) propaganda by speeches, newspapers, articles, celebration of anniversaries and &quot; days &quot; ;(/) utilisation of any other movements hostile to Government.4. Pecent information shows that the Communist International have in no way abandoned their general policy, indeed there are sums that in respect of India they are likelj&apos; to intensify it. The following is a brief survey of more recent communist activities in India and elsewhere : (1) There is a general increase in communist activities in Great Britain and elsewhere. A recent police report received from England gives a description of the programme of the Communist International and of the stages by which it seeks to obtain its ultimate ideal of the complete abolition of the Capitalist. State. Their comment on this is as follows: &quot; This is no mere paper programme. It is being carried out in practically every country in the world by methods which increase in efficiency as each year brings greater practical experience.&quot; They add : &quot; The cumulative effect of communist propaganda, which never ceases, has become a factor of the national life in most countries and cannot be ignored. . . . The steady underground work, moreover, which is the spear-head of the communist attack, does not, and is not meant to, attract attention.&quot;(2) There is direct evidence to show that the Communist International has opened schools both at Moscow and elsewhere at which Indians and others are being trained in the science of revolution and conspiracy, in espionage, in sabotage, in street fighting and in propaganda, so that on return to their own countries they may train others, broaden the basis of militant communism among the masses, and put, into practical effect what they have learnt. Some 30 to 50 Indians from India and other parts of the Empire are under training. Some of these Moscow-trained communists have returned to India, not, it is true, in large numbers (probably only five or six), but it became necessary some four or five mouths ago to deal with one in the Punjab under Regulation III, while another was recently arrested in Calcutta, and it was proved that he had been in communication with one of the leading communists in Germany (Rattan Singh) and had come on an important mission to effect a liaison between the communist groups of the Punjab and Bengal. This is important as showing the all-India nature of the danger and that it is not merely the Ghadr conspirators of the Punjab who have to be considered. .
(3) The Meerut conspirators during the time they were under trial sent home a very lengthy and detailed report to the Communist International criticising&apos; existing methods and suggesting that a revision of methods was necessary. One of the suggestions in this document was that British communists should be sent out, and information has been obtained that effect will be given to this suggestion. Bradley, one of the leaders, has now been released and has returned to England, and there is no doubt that he will carry on the conspiracy in that country. The other released Meerut prisoners also do not appear to have abandoned their former practices and seem to be re-estab-lishing their position as leaders.(4) Apart from the training of students in Moscow, there are other examples of Soviet activity, e.g. wireless propaganda ; anti-British intrigue in Afghanistan and Persia ; and the attempts that are being made to penetrate Burma from Shanghai through Singapore. The Times recently reported that the Communist International had prepared a new Colonial thesis for India. Of this a copy has not yet been obtained, but if the report is correct it appears to be on much the same lines as the Draft Platform of Action, which is reproduced at the end of &quot; Communism in India.&quot;(5) Further, there are the activities of the associations connected with the Communist International, such as the League against Imperialism, which, though somewhat hard hit by the action taken against it 9 or 10 months ago in Germany, is now redeveloping its activities, and the British section of which has recently circulated to Indian newspapers a document which advocates the demand for complete independence of India and of Burma outside the British Empire and pays homage to the courage of those who commit individual acts of terrorism against the agents of Imperialism, especially to Surja Sen. This organisation, it may be noted, was particularly active shortly before the events which necessitated the institution of the Meerut case.(6) A final point is that there is definite evidence to show that the Communist International is looking forward to the change of Constitution as a suitable opportunity for extending its activities.5. The ultimate object of communism is thus to overthrow by violence the present form of government and the present economic structure. But this final consummation is to be reached by an elaborate series of insidious processes. The first stage is the stage of propaganda and the creation of a communist mentality. It is at this stage that the communist attack must be met if the ultimate attack is to be defeated, and this stage is the more dangerous at the present time when world-wide economic conditions render the position of both industrial workers and peasants unsatisfactory. The propaganda is both direct and indirect. Hitherto, direct communist propaganda-has been amazingly frank and outspoken, and it was largely as a result of this characteristic that Government were able to secure convictions in the iieerut case and to show by the cumbrous and expensive method of a conspiracy trial that the communist activities amounted to a conspiracy to deprive the King-Emperor of the sovereignty of India. Apart from this, there are the indirect and insidious activities of the communists who endeavour to utilise legitimate means for the purpose of creating a situation which will encourage the development of the communist spirit. On the industrial side, the communists endeavour to insinuate themselves into Trade Unions and to win the confidence of the workers by taking up their grievances. Their object is primarily to stir up unrest, to foment strikes and finally to lead up to a general strike and a condition of general disorder. Ou the agricultural side the object is to preach in the villages discontent with existing conditions, hostility to the landlords, confiscation of property, non-payment of rent with the general object of injury to landlords, depriving Government of its revenue and in the last resort producing conditions of disorder.6. It appears to the Government of India that there are three main activities which have to be met:  (a) The direct propaganda of communism.(b) Organisations intended to promote the communist policy ; and(c) The subterranean activities of individual communist workers.7. The Government of India have made a careful examination of the powers given by the existing law to deal with these activities.   They have also examined the 2701 A 2
various laws recently enacted in other countries to meet this menace. With regard to (a), in so far as the communist attack is directed to the overthrow of the existing form of government, Chapter VI of the. Indian Penal Code gives adequate powers to meet by judicial action seditious propaganda or revolutionary conspiracies. But neither the Penal Code nor any other Acts in force cover propaganda directed to the destruction of the existing economic organisation. The experience of the Meerut case also shows that a conspiracy case can be protracted to inordinate length by the tactics of the accused, and that even though a conviction may be ultimately obtained the accused are able;to carry on propaganda by means of the statements made by them during the trial of the case.With regard to (6), the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 190S provides a suitable machinery for dealing with subversive organisations. Under it an association may be declared unlawful if its object is to interfere with the administration of the law or with the maintenance of law and order, or if it constitutes a danger to the public peace. Ultimately no doubt all communistic activities are a danger to the public j)eace, and it might be possible as a result of trie findings of the Meerut case to declare unlawful an association such as the Communist Party of India. But it may not be possible to bring a communist association in its earlier stages under the terms of this Act, and it appears to the Government of India to be desirable to have power to deal at an early stage with communist associations and members of such associations.In regard to (c), the subterranean activities of individual communist workers, which will probably be the most dangerous and effective part of the communist attack, the greatest practical difficulty arises. It seems clear that for dealing with these subterranean activities ordinary judicial action will not prove effective and that some executive process will be required. Regulation III, it is true, gives the widest possible executive power, but the use of this power ou a large scale would be open to serious objections. The Government of India, therefore, consider that if the danger is to be met effectively executive power should be taken which, while not extending to-detention of individuals in jail, would enable the Government to extern individuals from certain areas, to restrict them to certain areas, and to direct them to refrain from certain activities, and in the case of British communists to order their deportation.8. In order to facilitate consideration a draft Bill has been prepared, of which I am to enclose a copy with brief notes on the clauses drawiug attention to the special points on which the views of the Local Government will be valuable. It is recognised that owing to the nature of the problem it is difficult to obtain a wholly satisfactory definition of the activities that require to be restrained or wholly satisfactory means of dealing with them. The main practical question is whether legislation of this character is required and whether the general lines of the draft, are suitable and likely to be effective.9. A brief reference has been made above to the connection of terrorism and communism. In so far as both movements aim at the overthrow of the existing form of government, their aims are identical, though their methods are different. But there are growing signs of the terrorist recognising the. disadvantages of individual outrages and tending to the mass movement of the communists. It seems not unlikely that the future development will be in the direction of a merging of terrorism and communism, the former restricting its policy of individual outrages, the latter perhaps tending to look with more favour on a poiic)^ of early violence. The present Bill, though designed primarily to deal with communists, will, it is thought, prove useful for dealing with terrorists and terrorist organisations in those Provinces where there is no special legislation in force, and to which the increase of pressure on the terrorist in Bengal may drive them. Associations, such as the Hindustan Socialist Republic Army, would fall under the definition in clause 2, and the power to control the activity of a terrorist by means of a restrictive order may prove very useful.10. If it is decided to proceed with legislation, the Government of India would propose to introduce a Bill at the end of the present session and move a motion for circulation. The Bill would then be circulated and Local Governments would have further time for considering its details. It would be,taken up for final consideration during the next session of the Assembly, which will probabhy be held in July and August. In view of this programme 1 am to ask that the views of the Local Govern -ment on the general appreciation of the situation, and on the general principles and, as far as time permits, the details of the Bill, may be communicated to the Government
zTelegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State,dated 18th March 1934.Your telegram of the 13th instant, 688. Communist legislation. We deal first with your point that you are not convinced that the present situation demands immediate legislation. The appreciation which we put before Local Governments in our express letter of 8th February was briefly as follows : (a) Communist menace is real.(b) Experience of Meerut case shows that existing powers are inadequate.(c) There are signs of spread of communist ideas and intensification of communistactivities, which may at any moment create dangerous situation, in par-ticular at very difficult time of introduction of new Constitution.2. You will receive by this air mail Local Governments&apos; replies, except from Burma and Central Provinces, and will see that there is general agreement as to necessity of. legislation proposed. We are specially impressed by views of Bombay, who point out that situation has deteriorated in recent months as a result of return of Meerut prisoners ; and of Madras, who quote numerous instances to show that there is no lack of communist organisation in that Presidency, -which may become dangerous. The United Provinces and North-West Frontier Province also draw attention to the special danger in their Provinces. Other Governments have accepted our appreciation of the situation, and it is to be noted that Bengal, who have made a very careful examination of details of the Bill, consider that, as the consequences of the spread of communist ideas in country such as India may be very serious, the penalties should be enhanced.Our view that legislation should be undertaken without further delay thus receives general support and, with the exception of the Hon. Sir Fazl-i-Husain, whose views are given below, we adhere strongly to this view, for the following reasons :  (a) Though the situation has not yet deteriorated to such an extent as to render the immediate assumption of new powers essential, yet there has been, in recent months, a wide dissemination of communist ideas, and, as Bombay report in particular shows, this intensification of communist activities may lead to very rapid deterioration of situation.(b) We do not wish to rush legislation of this importance through Assembly, yetif we wait until situation has grown worse we may be forced to do so. We regard it as very important that our proposals should be fully discussed and considered by the public, for such discussion will serve to bring home to them the reality of the dauger, and will also, we hope, tend to create a public opinion against communism.We fully recognise the necessity of effective counter-propaganda and we intend to devote attention to this during the circulation of the Bill.- of India not later than the 10th March. I atn to regret that so short a period is available for the consideration of this very important subject, but if communist legislation is to be undertaken it seems desirable that it should be carried through before the end of the year, while at the same time the Government of India desire that the country should have a full opportunity of considering the proposals before they are submitted to the Legislature for its final decision.M. G. Hallett, Secretary to the Government of India.Telegram from Secretary of State to Government of India, dated Vitk March 193-1.Your Secretary&apos;s letter I3th February. Communist legislation. I do not feel that I am in a position to comment usefully on your proposals until I am in possession of views of Local Governments, but at first sight the scope of the Bill appears to be very wide.As at present advised I am not convinced that present situation demands immediate introduction of legislation of this kind as you propose. No doubt opinions of Local Governments will throw light on this point, but have you considered whether your immediate needs could not be met by introduction of Immigration Bill as suggested in 1928 ?
s(c) Our programme will give full time for discussion ; if we attempted to pass theBill through all its stages during the next Simla session, which will probably be the last session of the present Assembly, we should be severely criticised and, in fact, it is doubtful whether we should succeed in passing the Bill. If we waited until the first session of 1935 we might have considerably more difficulty with the Assembly, and, as the Bill could hardly be passed at a single session, its concluding stage might be just before the first general election under the new Constitution.Moreover, it might well be that by that time communism would have obtained a start which we should iind it difficult to overtake.(d) We consider, therefore, that we should take present opportunity for proceeding with the Bill. We have before us examples of other countries showing deplorable effects of allowing communist propaganda to continue unchecked too long, and drastic measures which such a policy, in the end, entails. We regard it, therefore, as essential that present and future Governments should have powers available to deal promptly and effectively with movement in its earlier stages.3. The Hon. Sir Fazl-i-Husain urges that, with the exception of Bombay, the Provinces do not regard communism as an immediate, but only as a probable, menace even in industrial centres. As regards agricultural areas, there is no immediate menace anywhere, although apprehensions of it are entertained in many places.He, therefore, does not regard the menace as such as to justify immediate legislation, especially in view of the special powers possessed by some Local Govern-ments enabling them to deal with communist activities effectively. He apprehends that legislation of this kind definitely ranges the Government on the side of the existing order and may therefore discourage, indirectly, reforms for the benefit of agricultural tenants. It may also have unfortunate result of promoting agrarian and class strife instead of allowing advent of reforms, with the enfranchisement of the masses, to promote improvement in conditions of tenants.4. We cannot accept this view as a valid criticism of our proposals. If there are legitimate grievances among the agricultural population, that renders the danger of communists securing a commanding position all the greater. Our proposals are designed to check only the revolutionary aims of the communists.They are not intended and will not be used to oppose reasonable reforms. We recognise fully that present economic conditions are such as to render it very necessary to deal with the problem of agricultural and labouring classes, and this is a problem to which both we and all Local Governments are devoting, and will continue to devote, most serious attention. We have not the slightest intention, after arming ourselves with these powers, to ignore pressing economic problems.5. The suggestion that some Local Governments already possess powers enabling them to deal effectively with communism appears to us to be without substance, and it is noticeable that not a single Local Government put forward such a view. The special powers possessed by some Local Governments are only temporary, were designed to meet a different situation and cannot be expected to be adequate substitute for our proposals. For dealing with all-India movement such as this. all-India legislation of a permanent character is required.6. You make the suggestion that present situation might be met by Bill giving less wide powers on lines of Immigration Bill considered in 1928. We are faced, however, not merely with problem of dealing with British agents but with more serious problem of indigenous communist agitators and Moscow-trained Indians. Legislation on lines of Immigration Act would not touch second problem and would be merely an indirect, and therefore less effective, way of dealing with the first problem. Discussion of legislation on lines proposed by us will, we think, serve useful purpose in bringing home to Indian public reality of the danger, and we do not wish to camouflage the issue.7. If motion for circulation is to be passed in present session, we must introduce the Bill at the latest on or about 10th April and we should, therefore, be glad to have your final views not later than 31st March. Our next telegram gives proposed state-inent of objects and reasons and a further telegram will be despatched to-morrow giving modifications which we propose after considering views of Local Governments. We regret that time is short for considering details, but, if you agree to general lines-of Bill, modifications of details could be further discussed while Bill is in circulation..
Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State,dated I9 /i March 1934.Continuation of our telegram 647 of .19th March. Communist legislation. Following is proposed draft of statement of objects and reasons : &quot;For some years past evidence has been available to show that subversive -activities of Communist International are being directed against India. The general policy of the Communist International is to bring about by violent revolution the destruction of government established by law and present economic organisation of society, and to establish what they describe as the dictatorship of the proletariat. This object is to be attained by causing industrial and agrarian strife and thereby stirring up the masses to mass action such as general strikes and violent uprisings.&quot;A branch organisation of the Communist International was established in India in 1921 and it was held by the High Court of Judicature in Allahabad in the Meerut conspiracy case in 1933 that &apos; the members of the communist party of India have undoubtedly formed a revolutionary body with the professed object of overthrowing the present order of society and bringing about complete independence of India by means of armed uprisings of the proletariat which includes the workers and peasants &apos;; that their object was not a distant but an immediate object; and that there were also other parties &apos; the formation of which is a part of the programme laid down by the Communist International and is in furtherance of its aims and objects.&apos; It was also found that the agent of the Communist international had been sent out to India from England through the medium of one of its branches for furthering its aims.&quot;Recent information shows that Communist International have in no way abandoned their policy or their programme and, indeed, there are signs that subversive communist activities are being intensified and will be further intensified if a suitable opportunity occurs. Realising great danger of this movement to the peace and prosperity of India, Government of India are satisfied that it is necessary to obtain by legislation further powers to deal with both organisations and individuals advocating or promoting activities designed or calculated to carry this programme, or any similar revolutionary programme, into effect, and to exercise effective control over such organisations and individuals before their activities have resulted in widespread disorder. The Bill is -also designed to give power to remove from the country British communist agents, and to control use of funds which are intended to be applied to carrying out communist programme. The Bill is not intended to interfere in any way with lawful and constitutional activities designed for betterment of agricultural or industrial population.&quot;
