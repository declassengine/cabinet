April 6, 1934.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[T 3927/39/374] No. 1.Sir John Simon to Sir R. Lindsay (Washington).(No. 310.)Sir, Foreign Office, April 6, 1934.Mr. BINGHAM called this morning to show me the messages which had passed between himself and the State Department on the subject of the extra-dition of Jacob Factor. The Ambassador&apos;s message set out with force and point the considerations which I had urged upon him at our interview of the 28th March (see my despatch No. 297 of that date), and expressed his strong personal hope that the extradition could be expedited. The reply of the State Department, however, was wholly discouraging. Mr. Hull took up the position that it was impossible to execute the order of extradition until the criminal proceedings against the Tuohy gang were finally disposed of, and it was implied that this not only involves the appeals and possible retrials in reference to cases already dealt with, but might even extend to other indictments not yet tried at all! Mr. Hull could, of course, indicate no limiting date to this process, but was good enough to add that when the process was finally completed he, &quot;as at present advised,&quot; would be disposed to direct the extradition to take place.2. The Ambassador was thoroughly distressed at his failure to get from the State Department a more sympathetic reply, and dwelt upon the strength of American opinion on the necessity of securing that kidnappers were punished. Mr. Hull&apos;s despatch even hinted that Factor&apos;s candid and valuable evidence against the kidnappers might provide some argument against his extradition being pressed, especially as he was understood to have made some compensation to some of those whom he had defrauded, but I gave no encouragement to this idea, which is wholly opposed to British notions of the proper administration of criminal justice when dealing with the perpetrator of a gross fraud.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.[88 f-1]
