ELEVENTH REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, March 1934.Part 1. Summary of recent economic developments.THE United States Gold Reserve Bill, giving the President power to fix the gold content of the dollar by proclamation at any point between 50 and 60 per cent, of its previous gold content, became law on the 30th January. On the following day the President issued a proclamation, fixing the gold content of the dollar at 59-06 per cent, of its previous content, but reserving the right to alter this content should circumstances require it. Simultaneously it was announced that gold from any source would be bought at this price by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as agent for the United States.2. As a result of this announcement two movements were initiated having contrary effects upon the exchanges. First there was a certain movement of capital back to America, due in the main to the closing of speculative transactions by bear operators. Some foreign capital was also invested in America. Secondly, it became profitable to buy gold in Europe for shipment to New York. So long as the first movement continued the purchase of gold on American account did not succeed in bringing the gold exchanges into line. By the end of February, how-ever, the movement of funds to New York appears to have ceased, and the dollar franc exchange reached a point at which the shipment of gold was no longer profitable. The final effect of these conflicting movements was to raise the price of gold in London, and to depress the value of sterling in terms of the franc. The dollar sterling exchange shows on balance no appreciable change since the beginning of the year.. The following table gives the rates of exchange in Paris and New York and the price of gold since the beginning of the year.Table 1..Exchange rates and gold prices. -Date, 1934.

The price of gold reached 140s. per ounce, its highest point, on the 5th February.   Gold to the value of 593 million dollars was bought by the
American authorities between the 1st February and the 9th March. The losses of gold of the principal European central banks during February were as follows : Table 2.Recent gold losses of Central Banks.(000,000&apos;s omitted.)

Between the 1st February and the 7th March the Federal Reserve Banks increased their holding of gold certificates by 634-6 million dollars. Throughout the period of drain the imports of gold into the United Kingdom exceeded the exports of gold. During the six weeks ending the 12th March, imports of gold amounted to  111,500,000, and exports to  63,500,000.4. The recent losses of gold by the Bank of France have been largely offset over the last three months by the purchase of bills. The losses of the Netherlands Bank, on the other hand, have been balanced by reductions in the note circulated and in private deposits. In France there has been some advance in interest rates, both long and short, the bank rate was raised from 2\ to 3 per cent, on the 8th February, and the French Government has thought it prudent to borrow a substantial sum in Holland. Deposits in commercial banks in France have been falling throughout 1933.5. Movements of commodity prices in recent months have been in an upward direction in Great Britain and the United States of America.Table 3.Wholesale commodity prices.	Great Britain.

The prices of British securities have continued to rise with remarkable steadiness. In New York, on the other hand, there was a sharp upward movement in the early part of the year followed by a setback in recent weeks.Table 5.Security prices.	Great Britain.		United States.

The recession in American security prices which occurred during the middle of February was said to be connected with the Presidents recommendation of legislation to control speculative activities, including requirements for a very substantial margin to cover stocks held speculatively.More recent movements of commodity prices are shown in the following table, in which all figures are based on the 18th September, 1931 = 100.Table 4.
8. The figures for employment in Great Britain during recent months have shown no sign of any setback. They have not, however, shown the rate of improve-ment noticeable during the summer of last year.Table 6.Employment among insured toorkers in Great Britain.Ministry of Labour&apos;s estimate of Index number of employmentemployment, excluding persons corrected for seasonal variations,directly involved in trade disputes, average for years 1924-25 andin thousands.      * 1926-30 = 100.1929		10,220				103-7		1930		9.797				99-4		193L		9,421				95-6		1932		9,348				94-9		1933          .		0,680				98-3			1932.	1933.	1934.	1932.		1933.	1934.

The Board of Trade index of industrial production for the last quarter of 1933 reached 104-0, compared with 96-8 in the third quarter (which is normally considerably smaller than the fourth quarter), and 95-0 in the fourth quarter of 1932. The figure for the year 1933 was 98-2. compared with 93-3 in 1932 and 93-7 in 1931.10. Steel production in January and February continued to be satisfactory, amounting to 711-0 and 707-5 thousand tons respectively, compared with 668-9 thousand tons in December last, and 444-4 in January and 482-7 in February last year. Retail trade has shown the following movements during the last four years: Table 7.Retail trade in Great Britain, Bank of England Index, compared with the average for 1933 as 100, for the years 1930-31 to 1933-34.Retail Trade.-	1929.	1930.	1931.	1932.	1933.	1934.January		110	110	104	97	101February		101	95	91	88	March		105	103	97	94	April		114	106	104	104	May		118	112	105	100	June		107	104	100	101	July		112	107	100	99	August	104	96	92	86	86	September	100	102	98	94	93	October	117	112	105	101	102	November	118	111	103	101	104	December   ..          ..	137	134	127	126	131	Whole year		110	105	101	100	
During the last few months there has been a tendency for retail sales to expand to an extent more in keeping with the increase which has taken place in employment and business activity generally.11. Industrial activity in America has recovered in recent months from the set-back of last autumn. The Federal Reserve Board&apos;s index of industrial production (adjusted for seasonal movements) has been as follows : Table 8.United States industrial production. Federal Reserve Board index.(years 1923-25 = 100.)1933- 1933-March......... 60 November      ......      72June   ...      ...      ... 92 December      ...      ...      75September...... 84 1934-October ...... 77 January        ......    .78More recent movements of business activity may be judged from the New York Times index of business activity, which has been as follows : Table 9.New York Times index of business activity.January 6 January 13 January 20 January 27 February 378-5 76-3 77-0 77-2 78-4February 10 February 17 February 24 March 3 March    1080-2 82-2 84-5 82-3 83-712. The index of industrial production in France declined from 107 in November to 106 in December and remained at that level during January. In December 1932 it stood at 98 and in January 1933 at 99. The number of unemployed in receipt of public assistance has risen from 312,000 at the end of 1933 to 351,000 on the 24th February. The comparable rise last year was from 277,000 on the 31st December to 331,000 on the 25th February. The percentage changes in traffic receipts in France as compared with last year are as follows : Table 10.French traffic receipts.Week ending  January    7 January  14 January  21 January 28Percentage change compared with 1933.... -702... -013... +0-09... 4-3-28Week ending  February   4 February 11 February 18 February 25Percentage change compared with 1933.... -1-47... -307... - 714... -206The output of steel in France in December was 484-3 thousand tons corn-pared with 480-4 thousand tons in November and 501-0 thousand tons in December 1932.13. The unemployment figures in Germany were given as 3,773,000 in February, compared with 4,059,000 in January and 6,014,000 and 5,773,000 in February and January respectively last year. But the official figures in Germany must for various reasons be regarded with caution. The output of steel in Germany in January was 804,000 tons, compared with 719,000 tons in December and 532,000 tons in January last year. The value of retail .trade showed a reduction of 6 per cent, in 1933 in comparison with 1932.14. German foreign trade showed an adverse balance in January for the first time since January 1930. Exports in January amounted to 350 million marks and imports to 372 million marks, showing a deficit of 22 million marks. In 1933 there was a surplus of 23 million marks. In February there was again a deficit of 35 million marks, exports amounting to 343 million marks and imports to 378 million marks.
15.   The gold value of world trade has recently been as follows : Table 11.League of Nations index of the gold vahie of world trade.Year 1930...1931...1932 ...1933... 1933 OctoberNovemberDecember1929 = 100.Imports. 85-1 58-3 391 34-8* 35-4* 35-5* 36 1*Exports. 80-1 56-9 38-7 35 1* 37-9* 37-3* 37-4*Provisional16. Exports of United Kingdom goods from the United Kingdom at  31,609,000 showed an increase of 8-6 per cent, in January 1934 compared with January 1933 and of 1-6 per cent, compared with January 1932. Imports at  64,700,000 showed an increase of 20-0 per cent, compared with 1933 and of 4-2 per cent, compared with 1932. Exports in February amounted to  30,060,000, showing an increase of 7-6 per cent, compared with 1933, but being practically equal to those for 1932; imports to  57,354,000, an increase of nearly 17 per cent, over 1933, but a decrease of over 18 per cent, compared with 1932.17. The Cfiantries British exports to which showed the largest changes in the fourth quarter of 1933 were as follows : Table 12.Principal changes in British exports in the fourth quarter of 1933compared with 1932.In  ,000.(a) Foreign Countries.United StatesArgentineNetherlandsSwedenDenmarkNorwayRoumaniaFinlandSoviet UnionFrance ...Japan and KwantungBelgiumGermanyIncreases. 1,120 687 402 362 318 265 252 235Decreases.1,680 456 288 272 250(b) British Countries.South AfricaCanadaIndiaIrish Free State West africa,497 999 787 319645The decline in exports to West Africa is in part attributable to reduced purchasing power owing to the low price for cocoa, which fell by about 25 per cent, in 1933 as compared with 1932, but is also an indication of the growing strength of J apanese competition in that quarter.[9829] c
18. The Board of Trade figures for the British balance of payments for 1933 show an adverse balance on income account of  4 millions, compared with adverse balances of  56 millions and  104 millions in 1932 and 1931. The improvement is due to a reduction of  23 millions in the excess of imports of merchandise, and to a reduction of  24 millions in Government payments over-seas, on account of the smaller American debt payment. &quot;While the balance of payments of Great Britain thus still shows a slight deficit, there has been a marked improvement in the corresponding balance of the overseas Empire. It has been estimated by competent judges that there was a favourable balance of payments for the Empire as a whole during the year 1933 of not far short of  100 millions. This is a point of crucial importance in connection with such questions as the underlying strength of sterling and the soundness of the short-term position of London. For there is less danger in the case of Empire countries than in that of foreign countries that short-term balances accumulated in London as the result of a favourable trade balance might be suddenly withdrawn at an inconvenient moment.
Part 2. The present economic situation.19. Since our last report was written, President Roosevelt has solved the dilemma arising from the ineffectiveness of his previous gold-buying policy by taking a step which is equivalent in many respects, and as regards its immediate consequences, to a de facto return to the gold standard. The United States Government now undertakes to buy all the gold brought to it, and in certain circumstances to sell gold, at a price to be fixed from time to time by the President. The President, moreover, has announced that this price will be fixed within limits corresponding to a dollar between 50 per cent, and 60 per cent, of its former gold value; and, for the time being, he has fixed a price which nearly corresponds to the higher of these limits. He thus retains the power of effecting a further substantial devaluation of the dollar at any time, for the dollar can be reduced to anything down to five-sixths of its present gold value; and, in view of the uncertainties of the American situation, both economic and political, it would be rash to rule out the possibility that this power may be used. Apart, however, from a serious emergency, the President will probably prefer to keep this power in reserve. In the meantime, the re-establishment of a link, even if somewhat precarious, between the dollar and gold, has been generally regarded throughout the world as a step in the direction of currency stabilisation.20. The undertaking to buy gold presented to the American Treasury without limit as to quantity has, of course, sufficed. to make the gold price effective, and this has naturally entailed a further depreciation of the dollar relatively to the franc and other gold currencies. It has not led, however, to a further depreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling, but rather the reverse. For the provisional stabilisation has diminished distrust in the future of the dollar, and this has been enough, in view of the great underlying strength of the Hollar position, to cause a movement of funds to the United States. The consequence has been a material increase in the sterling price of gold, so that sterling has fallen along with the dollar in terms of the gold currencies.21. The exchange position that results is seriously out of relation with the underlying economic realities. The pound is still overvalued in terms of the dollar at the present American level of costs, while it is certainly seriously under-valued in terms of the franc and other gold currencies. For the moment, and as far as purely competitive considerations are concerned, this position is, perhaps, not on balance unsatisfactory from the standpoint of British trade. For our industries are probably exposed to a larger degree of direct competition in world markets from the industries of the continental gold countries than from those of the United States, which, indeed, supplies us with a number of our essential imports. But the present position subjects the European gold countries to a severe strain, which is directly detrimental to the revival of economic activity and is leading to a further intensification of trade restrictions. There is, moreover, a strong likelihood that, after considerable damage to general world recovery has first been done in these ways, the gold countries will later abandon their present parities, and that the comparatively favourable competitive position which British industry now enjoys will disappear.22. At present the difficulties of the continental gold countries are steadily growing. France has for some time had an adverse balance of payments, which must be expected to increase. By itself this adverse balance is not likely to reach a point at which it would cause a really embarrassing drain upon the French stock of gold. But it will exert an unfavourable influence upon French trade, and will diminish the chances of a return of confidence. The deflationary process is already in evidence. Bank deposits are falling; interest rates are rising; the Government is in financial difficulties; production and employment are diminishing; foreign trade is becoming more and more difficult. On the other hand, many of the necessaries of life are maintained at very high prices by the protectionist measures designed for the defence of the franc. Finally, as the result of incidents such as the Stavisky scandal, the prestige of authority in France, whether political or financial, has been seriously impaired in a manner that recalls the almost universal discredit of leading men in the United States a year or so ago.   In these circumstances, widespread distrust of the currency[9829] c 2
may develop at any time on a scale sufficient to make either devaluation or the suspension of the gold standard inevitable. In view of the lengths to which the restrictions on foreign trade have already been carried, it is not easy for the French to alleviate the situation by reducing imports much further. Many of the difficulties of the French are also being experienced in the other countries which have hitherto maintained the gold standard without qualification, while in Italy and Germany, though for different causes, there is evidence of growing exchange difficulties. In the case of Germany, indeed, it would not be surprising if the situation were to entail a further default by the German authorities on their external obligations. Czecho-Slovakia, one of the continental countries attached to the gold group, has decided to abandon within recent weeks its gold parity, and has created a new precedent, which may conceivably serve as an encouragement to other countries, by effecting a definite devaluation simul-taneously with the abandonment of its previous parity.23. Thus the economic outlook for the immediate future is unpromising in the greater part of the European continent, while it is uncertain whether any favourable reactions on British trade from the further improvement which may be expected in the United States will be sufficient to outweigh the increasing competition of American industries in world markets. At the moment, the most hopeful feature of the external outlook is the growing improvement in the over-seas parts of the British Empire. The Dominions and the Colonies as a whole have alike benefited materially from the recovery that has taken place in the prices of primary products, and, as has been indicated in Part 1, they are now in a strong position as regards the balance of payments. As we pointed out in our tenth report, the overseas Empire contributed little to the improvement in British exports which took place in the middle of last year. Recently, however, therchas been a change in this respect; and the underlying conditions seem to offer considerable scope for a steady increase in British exports to these markets.24. With this exception, the outlook for our overseas trade is not encouraging; and we are disposed to reiterate the warning which we expressed as follows in our tenth report (dated January 1934) : &quot; So far as we can gather .... the order book position of export manufacturers remains satisfactory upon the whole, although there are indications that the difficulty of competing in markets in the American continent is already being felt. Possibly, therefore, despite the disconcerting drop in December, the figures for British exports will continue to be favour-able for a few months to come. But we can feel no assured confidence that our export trade recovery will be sustained over a longer period, if the present depreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling is maintained, and still less if the depreciation is carried further.&quot;25. If these misgivings are well-founded, the continuance of the economic recovery in Great Britain will depend on a further expansion of internal activity. There is no reason to suppose that this internal expansion has as yet nearly reached its possible limits. We have called attention in the previous part of this report to the expansion which took place in retail purchases during the close of the year ending the 31st January, 1934. These figures indicate that retail purchases did not immediately respond to the increasing incomes consequent upon increased employment in the summer of 1933. This is a quite natural tendency. The course of the depression had the effect of impairing the liquid resources of a large proportion of the consuming public. The rise which took place in the value of securities during 1932 and 1933 restored the position of those classes who possess them, and the resulting increase of purchases on their part, especially of such durable goods as motor cars, was certainly an important element in the improvement that took place last year. But the majority of those whose incomes were reduced by the depression would experience little or no relief from this quarter, and it is only natural that a considerable part of their increased earnings should have been devoted to relieving their financial situation both by the repayment of debts and the restoring of savings to their previous level. As. however, this process is completed, it may be expected that an increasing pro-portion of new earnings will be devoted to current consumption. Indeed, the figures for retail sales in the last quarter of last year are an earnest of this.
26. On the other hand, we may possibly be within sight of at least a temporary slackening of an impulse which contributed much to the industrial recovery last year namely, the tendency to undertake plant renewals which had been allowed to fall into arrears in previous years. The recovery has so far been centred in the industries producing capital goods; and these industries have now reached a level of activity which is perhaps as great as it is reasonable to expect to be sustained, failing any large reconstruction demand from such industries as shipbuilding and the railways, and failing substantial export business. While, accordingly, there still remains a wide margin for expansion in the consumption industries, the improvement under this head which we should expect to result from a gradual growth of retail demand may be offset at any time by a slight recession of constructional activity. The process of recovery from previous depressions has often been chequered by a slight setback at a stage comparable with that which we have now reached; and the unfavourable export outlook increases the possibility of such a setback on the present occasion.27. In any case, it is important to appreciate that, on the most favourable assumptions, a recovery along the present lines, i.e., resting mainly on the restoration of internal activity, cannot be expected to go so far as to reduce unemployment to small proportions. The industries of this country are organised to produce goods for export on a scale far in excess of present demand, and, indeed, in excess of the demand experienced in the comparatively prosperous years preceding the slump. The hard core of unemployment in the years 1927 to 1929 was largely attributable to the reduced foreign demand for British coal, British textiles and for the products of British heavy industry. Since that time the volume of world trade has been reduced by 30 per cent., and the volume of British exports by 36 per cent. In such circumstances we do not anticipate that the natural recuperative tendencies of industry, if unaccompanied by any marked revival of world trade, or by any special stimulus that might be supplied, would suffice at the best to carry unemployment below a level of about 1,500,000, at any rate for a considerable period. It is, therefore, a vital interest of this country that there should be a revival of world trade. What are the probabilities of such a revival, and how soon may it be expected to occur ?28. To a large extent the factors in the present situation which are confining world trade within narrow limits owe their origin to causes intimately connected with an unprecedented crisis, which may be expected to pass as the world gradually assumes a more normal aspect. The restrictions on the free purchase and sale of one currency for another, so common to-day both in Europe and America, are the fruit of a general preoccupation with the problem of balancing-international receipts and payments. They may be expected to disappear, as default or agreement reduces the weight of international indebtedness within limits which the present volume of international trade can support. In the same way a general improvement in confidence is likely to be accompanied by the removal of the most vexatious of the present restrictions upon trade itself. This process is likely to be accelerated if prices show a tendency to rise during the next few years. For in that event the position of particular producers wall excite less sympathy, and the interests of the general body of the public in adequate supplies will make itself felt.29. Though these considerations give good ground for expecting some revival in international trade, they will hardly begin to operate immediately. The present disorganisation of world trade is not perhaps so complete as that which afflicted Europe during the inflationary crisis that followed the war. But it is worth remembering that it was not until 1927 that European trade showed definite signs of recovery. There are further influences operating in the opposite direction which make it probable that, even when world trade revives, it will not reach the same dimensions as before the slump. During the last few years industries have growm up in all countries to supply goods which had previously been imported, while agrarian protection in industrial countries has been carried to extravagant lengths. It is unlikely that the interests thus created will be sacrificed as soon as an improvement in the international situation reopens the original source of supply. Again, there is undoubtedly a growing desire throughout the world to introduce a larger element of conscious organisation in the control of economic development.   This control can only be exercised upon a
national scale, and it will, in consequence, probably be used in a way likely to injure international trade. It is possible that this mood may pass, if the results of organisation are less than are to-day expected of it. But that a change in opinion of this kind should come about rapidly is contrary to all experience.30. In addition to these general reasons for expecting that world trade will not recover its full loss, there is in the case of Great Britain the special factor of growing Asiatic competition over an important range of goods. This is likely to result in a serious permanent reduction of the export trade of the cotton industry, while it is not unlikely that other textile industries, such as woollens and worsted, will in time also be materially affected.31. Though a future improvement in the international situation may lead to the absorption of some of the workers in export industries who are at present likely to be unemployed, there is a prospect that the slump will leave a larger surplus in the exporting industries than existed in 1929. The power of industry to absorb such a surplus naturally depends in part upon the general prosperity which the country is enjoying. But that a very considerable redistribution of the working population may take place even in comparatively unfavourable circumstances may be seen from the following table which we reproduce from the Ministry of Labour Gazette.Table 13.Relative proportions of the total insured population included in certain large groups of industries in 1923 and 1933.

It is, however, of great importance that all reasonable steps should be taken to promote foreign demand for British exports. In this connection the policy of the embargo on new issues for foreign and Empire borrowers in the British market calls for careful consideration. Normal capital development has been damped down in most of the raw material producing countries during the course of the slump. Its revival would be of exceptional value to the heavy industries of this country. But in practice its revival is likely to be dependent largely on a renewal of international lending.33. So long as it was a central preoccupation of British policy to maintain the exchange value of sterling, this was a cogent reason for refusing to sanction issues which were liable to entail a strain on the exchange; and it was doubtless wise to be cautious about abandoning this policy, when sterling became embarrassingly strong, as the result of an inflow of short balances which might at any moment be withdrawn again. By now, however, it has become clear in our judgment that we are more likely to be embarrassed in the near future by an overvalued than by an undervalued sterling.   It is important to remember
in this connection that the marked improvement in the balance of payments of the overseas part of the Empire, which has been referred to above (paragraph 18), is a source of great underlying strength for sterling. We are of opinion therefore that the time has come when the embargo policy should be reconsidered.34. It is essential, of course, that issues of foreign securities should not be allowed in London in such quantities as to imperil the present strength of the gilt-edged market. This, however, is not a serious danger; since the number of foreign borrowers whose credit would be good enough under present conditions to enable them to raise loans at moderate rates of interest in the London market is not likely to be large. For the same reason, of course, the immediate benefit which might be expected to accrue to our export industries would not be great. None the less, the relaxation of the embargo would give a positive, if limited, stimulus to economic recovery at the point where a stimulus is most needed; and we suggest therefore that the present policy should now be reconsidered.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
